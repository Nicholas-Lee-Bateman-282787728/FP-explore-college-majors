4655533,5,B005D0RDKW,"This show was probably the best concert I have ever attended.  Rush was on the whole night.  From the opening video to the final note of Working Man, the entire audience of over 14000 was on their feet and into it.  I have never seen such an enthusiastic crowd!  Judging from McFadyen and Dunn's other films, this should be a quality DVD!",1314748800,2,338,4.403225806451613
4655534,5,B005D0RDKW,"Having seen Rush from Farewell to Kings, Permanent Waves, 2112, Hemispheres through the years (I have seen them 25 times. This tour was the best I have ever seen. The energy level was unreal. (These frickken guys are almost 60!) Wait that makes me 52 (almost) If they had played Moving Pictures ""only"" that would have more than ""worked"" for me. Its the only tatoo on me. I broke up with a girl I had gone out with for 2 years when she wanted to leave before the encore of the 2112 tour! I told her. ""You know where I'm parked if you want a ride. LOL! Great MUST HAVE dvd for you collecters and average buyers alike!",1314662400,3,615,4.220338983050848
4655535,5,B005D0RDKW,"About two or three weeks before my father and I, as well as a few good friends, went to this concert we all found out that a production crew would be filming it for a live DVD.  As a huge Rush fan, I was blown away by this.  I can promise you that both the band and the fans were on fire the entire show!  Cleveland was the perfect setting to shoot the film in and I am indebted to Rush for choosing the location, even though it is smaller than most large metropolitan areas, as in New York or L.A.

The concert itself was simply fantastic.  Moving Pictures was played all the way through and the rest was an awesome mash up of greatest hits, fan favorites and the newest singles material.  Neil, Alex, and Geddy were astounding as always.  I would recomend this title to anyone that enjoys live concerts, Rush, or any young person that is wanting to get into quality music.",1314316800,,874,4.260606060606061
4655536,5,B005D0RDKW,Have faith in Rush and they have never made 60 minute concerts on DVD. The new Rush DVD Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland DVD is 164 minutes long. Go to [...] and check this out about the new upcoming Rush DVD. The website is accurate information about the music DVD. Rush are well known for their marathon concerts. I know you are a Rush fan like me so don't worry. Rush DVD concerts are long.,1313971200,7,397,4.2368421052631575
4655537,5,B005D0RDKW,"I was there and it was fantastic. Anybody that was there,and ALL RUSH fans will want this DVD.My only problem is........60 minutes long??????Can we get this verified,that this will be the full length concert,and not only an hour long. If its only an hour,that stinks,if its the full concert,then I give it 10 STARS.I have been told the video will be 164 minutes long,it will be awesome.",1313798400,2,386,4.776119402985074
4655538,3,B005D0RDKW,"I had written a five-star review of this product before even purchasing it because I attended the Kansas City show on this tour, and was very happy with the concert.  I must have been oblivious to Geddy Lee's vocal performance in that show - I just didn't notice anything different from any of his other performances in the past.  Well, when I first played this live set, I was immediately aware of an ugh-factor in the vocal ""talent"" of Mr. Lee.  Yikes.  I know Geddy has never been the prototypical lead singer, with the soaring voice and expansive range.  But we Rush fans had grown accustomed to his banshee-like shrieks over the years and appreciated his window of ability that was uniquely his own.  Sadly, those days are over.  Now, he simply sounds like and old man who has lost what he once had and is still trying to hit those high notes again.  I really want to love this cd set.  Moving Pictures is a classic album, played complete for the first time ever on tour.  I love the song Camera Eye, as well as the two new tracks from their next album (if they ever finish it) Clockwork Angels.  I want this to be musical perfection.  Unfortunately, due to the embarrassing efforts of a certain lead singer, it isn't.  Rush fans - take heed.  This is not the same Rush we grew up with.  Enter at your own risk.",1313625600,9,1316,4.402489626556017

From Amazon UK:
Rush s Time Machine shows in 2010 / 11 were one of the most anticipated tours ever. Celebrating 30 years since the 1981 release of their classic bestselling album Moving Pictures the band performed the entire album live for the first time as the centrepiece of the concerts. The shows also featured favourite tracks from across their lengthy career and two new songs expected to feature on their next studio album. As ever the concerts were a visual feast and sounded great with the band playing at the top of their form. Reviews for the tour have been amazing from both fans and critics alike and this Blu-ray release is guaranteed to appeal to Rush fans everywhere. Bonus Features Alternative ending for The Real History Of Rush: Episode 2 ; Outtakes from History Of Rush: Episodes 2 & 17 ; Outtakes from I Still Love You Man ; Live from Laura Secord Secondary School (full clip from BLTS); Live from Passaic, NJ (full clip from BLTS).",1313107200,8,1009,4.631284916201118
4655540,5,B005D0RDKW,"I was at this show and, just as Shawn Roeder previously stated, the guys' playing was tight and the crowd was in rare form! Scot McFayden and Sam Dunn produced this as well as the band's documentary Beyond The Lighted Stage so this will be a well put together video! I was fortunate enough to be at the world premier of Beyond The Lighted Stage and can tell you Scot and Sam know what they're doing and have a certain reverence for it.

Paying tribute to the first city to play their music, the show was filmed in Cleveland and I can tell you the crowd and the band were feeding off each other all night to make it one to remember! This is also the first Rush show to be recorded and released in the USA so make sure you grab this important piece of Rush and music history! My wife and I had floor seats in the center section and there was a camera about 30 feet behind us so, when you watch the video and see the back of the bald guy's head wearing the white baseball jersey with the 11 on the back and Rush above the number, you can say ""Hey! That's the guy that wrote the review on Amazon about this video! He was right! It's awesome!""",1312588800,14,1138,4.103139013452915
4655541,5,B005D0RDKW,"This product has yet to be released, but I anxiously await it. The show was phenomenal, and if the filming, mixing and editing was even semi-professional, this DVD should be first rate.

4655575,3,B005D0RDKW,"What attracted me most to this DVD was the fact that the band was performing the entire Moving Pictures album, which is my favorite Rush album. There was also a lot of newer material that they performed that I was not familiar with though. The mix was not that great. that is my biggest complaint. Also, they had a couple of corny skits in there that I certainly could have done without. I could only really rate this as average. The performances were good. In fact they were excellent, instrumentally, but the mix just was not as good as I would have liked. Geddy Lee's voice was not up to snuff either. but if you want to see good musicians at work, the video was good enough quality to drive that point home.",1496620800,,711,4.353383458646617

4655614,5,B005D0RDKW,"Upgraded from the DVD to the Bluray. I wasn't expecting much improvement, but somebody sold it CHEAP. I was very pleasantly surprised.
The mix and master on the BD is very clear, most of the time, for all parts of the performance. Powerful and punchy bass, including an ever-present kick drum (very important to me - I HATE it when I can't hear and feel the kick for rock music). For those reviewers who feel the bass is ""boomy"" I suggest you recheck your HTS setup. You likely have something set incorrectly, like speaker size or other elements of bass management. This BD is way up there in terms of the best sounding Rush concert video.
Now, this is old Rush playing some Nu Rush songs as well as some classics. YMMV regarding enjoyment of the songs. I happen to like lots of Rush songs from all phases of their career and this is a good mix of material for me.",1471824000,2,864,4.372670807453416
4655615,5,B005D0RDKW,"I saw this concert in Chicago in August 2010. It was a rain makeup date from July 4th weekend. As a courtesy (for the inconvenience) everyone in  attendance was given a free [RUSH] hat upon exiting the venue (with custom stitching on the back [that read] 'The Rain Date Chicago 2010'). This is a great example of how fan oriented RUSH has always been. That show had the exact set list contained in this DVD, including all of the ""Moving Pictures"" LP release from 1981. They played songs that night that haven't been played in 20 or 30 years. What a treat for RUSH fans (like me). I've seen RUSH twenty-five times in five different states, every tour since ""Permanent Waves"" in 1980. This concert stands out as my absolute favorite RUSH show of all time, and (this DVD) is a must have for anyone who loves the band as much as I do. I watch it over and over (in DTS 5.1 with a 15"" subwoofer). Buy it now, you won't be sorry.......",1467763200,6,928,4.333333333333333

4655645,5,B005D0RDKW,"Huge Rush fan here so of course I loved it. But Geddy Lee's voice is shaky and while he does struggle vocally to hit some of the notes, he somehow pulls it off. Lee's bass playing is still stunning though. Lifeson's guitars are awesome and Neil Peart is the most incredible rock drummer of my generation. It has fun bits of video interspersed. Moving pitchers. Awesome double entendre that is no doubt intended to be a nod to the original Moving Pictures' album cover's triple entendre.",1449964800,,486,4.662790697674419

From Wallace Stevens:

 If the poetry of X was music,
So that it came to him of its own,
Without understanding, out of the wall

Or in the ceiling, in sounds not chosen,
Or chosen quickly, in a freedom
That was their element, we should not know

That X is an obstruction, a man
Too exactly himself, and that there are words
Better without an author, without a poet,

Or having a separate author, a different poet,
An accretion from ourselves, intelligent
Beyond intelligence, an artificial man

At a distance, a secondary expositor,
A being of sound, whom one does not approach
Through any exaggeration. From him, we collect.

Tell X that speech is not dirty silence
Clarified. It is silence made dirtier.
It is more than an imitation for the ear.

He lacks this venerable complication.
His poems are not of the second part of life.
They do not make the visible a little hard

To see nor, reverberating, eke out the mind
Or peculiar horns, themselves eked out
By the spontaneous particulars of sound.

We do not say ourselves like that in poems.
We say ourselves in syllables that rise
From the floor, rising in speech we do not speak.",1445644800,,1228,4.587155963302752

Having lived in Canada and the US I've seen Rush at least twice every time they've toured since the mid-nineties.  Now living overseas I don't get to see them that often anymore and I picked this up as an import in Bangkok.  It is the best thing I ever did.  One thing that being at the concert or just listening to them you don't get is the amazing interplay of instruments and talent they have.  Watching them play is unlike watching anyone else.  There is just so much going on with their instruments and watching it all is awesome.  They are just simply the best musical talent out there.  As well, the production of this DVD was excellent to me.  Sound was great and the camera sits quite a bit and just watches the musicians instead of constantly changing camera angles.  If you don't own one of these yet, definitely time to pick this one up.  I plan to get all of them.",1411603200,3,994,4.25668449197861

4655712,3,B005D0RDKW,"This is a good show, but not as good as Snakes and Arrows. The sound quality is inferior and the images aren't as crisp. I'd say this one is just one more for the collection, not a show that I'll be watching many times, just because the sound just doesn't have that ""thump"" element nor it has the sound and picture crispness of Snakes and Arrows.",1407110400,,346,4.257575757575758

4655715,5,B005D0RDKW,"This is an absolutely must-have Rush DVD, I've seen them live on three occasions, once in 1983 and lastly a show on this tour and there are a lot of older cuts played here that I'd never heard live.
They played the album Moving Pictures in its entirety, probably my favorite and arguably Rushs' best album ever. It was performed to perfection and showcased the tremendous talent of these three guys!",1403740800,,399,4.633802816901408

4655717,4,B005D0RDKW,"But I now have the official live video of my favorite song from the Moving Pictures album, THE CAMERA EYE.  The movie was configured for a sound system that I didn't have so I will always be reminded to switch to Dolby 5.1 or I wouldn't get any audio.  Very distracting indeed!  Wonderful video performances of Free Will, Presto, Stick it Out, and Far Cry.  Nice outakes, esp. of early Rush performances (Anthem and Need Some Love) and The REAL HISTORY OF RUSH, etc video features are hilarious even after a few viewings.  Blu-ray version generally sounds better if you have the equipment.  Highly recommended otherwise.",1400371200,,620,4.80188679245283
4655718,5,B005D0RDKW,"This is an exceptional concert video. The production, camera-work, and the sound are stellar. And the band's performance is outstanding.
I wish they had done Clockwork Angels tour DVD with this quality. Afer seeing that tour I found that CA DVD to be incredibly poor.
But this one...... holy smokes.... phenomenal capture of an incredible concert.",1400284800,,347,5.214285714285714
4655719,5,B005D0RDKW,"If you are unable to see this power trio live and up close, this release is your best bet. This release recorded from their Cleveland appearance captures them well into their Time Machine tour. The finesse and tightness of the band shows that these 3 guys are first and foremost, consummate musicians. The visual spectacle from this show was very well played out, of which video skits of amateur versions of the band were shown on a large video screen. To the delight of the crowd, the skits of the amateur version of several Rush songs were immediately followed up with power and gusto by the real band. This Blu-Ray version is taken from the same show in Cleveland and it will allow to realize where these ""polka band"" sounds re coming from (the skits.) From the opening number, ""Spirit of Radio"", to the finale, ""Working Man"", this concert will keep you very much entertained. A lot of their biggest numbers are all on here including the full live version of the album ""Moving Pictures."" Do yourself a favor and get the CD and Blu-Ray versions of this concert. Do not expect anything from ""Clockwork Angels"" to be on this release. Although they played songs from this album during this tour, they are not included on this release. Still, if you want to enjoy pure live music at its best, get this release!",1398470400,3,1308,4.618025751072961

4655733,5,B005D0RDKW,"Rush, if you love them, hate them, or are indifferent to them you should get this, rent this, view this.  It is an excellent performance, especially for being live. The sound is well done, the video is well done, and the interaction between the band members and the band members and audience is captured very well.

The music rocks, Rush is classic. It is good to see at about 60 yrs of age the band hasn't lost it.  I first saw them in the early 80s and this show proves to me they still have it at that level, which is amazing!

Definitely a worthy purchase.",1395360000,,560,4.254716981132075

When Spirit of Radio started, the crowd came alive and the 5.1 kicked in all 3 turned around in absolute shock and excitement looking at me.  All we could do was smile along with the tingles of excitement as we watched The Boys from Willowdale play.  I agree that the mix was slightly flat in the opening songs and then got better as the concert went along.  The HD is fantastic and listening in 5.1 is absolutely amazing.  You are immersed in the show.  I bought it for the videos Rush used during the concert...great humor and my boys loved it.  This is the only band I would take my family to see.

4655805,5,B005D0RDKW,"I have several concert/musicals on BluRay, and this is by far the best of them. The picture is super sharp; it helps that the concert stage was well lit (since, often everything outside a spotlight is dark) and I can see detail the audience probably couldn't. There's a bit of banding that shows up whenever the lights directly hit the camera, but otherwise, it's near perfect.
The sound is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and sounds much better than quite a few Live recorded CDs I have. It's well balanced for an immersive feel. It's not perfect, but I feel its 'flaws' lend to the feeling of being at a real concert.
If you like RUSH, you'll love this disc. If you only know Moving Pictures, this will expose you to a few songs you may not be familiar with (and you will be a better person for it).
Make sure you have your air guitar warmed up and ready; you'll be playing it (even if you never admit to it).",1366934400,12,916,4.3313953488372094

4655850,5,B005D0RDKW,"OK, I just had to get that title out of the way. I wish I'd been at Cleveland to see this show. It's a great set. The only Rush Shows I've seen lately have been at Red Rocks, so Snakes and Arrows twice and Time Machine twice. If you're a Rush fan and you haven't heard the audience recordings of the Time Machine shows at Red Rocks, you're missing out on some treats. I've read the critical comments by other reviewers here and I see it differently. Great performance, great A/V. Is it like a studio recording? Of course not! Rush has processes they use when writing that can give a certain snap-shot view of a song that very well might have progressed by the time it gets to your local venue. During the Time Machine tour, you could hear it by listening to Caravan from the studio with what it had become by the time they reached Denver. It was alive! You simply have to see Rush live - and often. People have been reported to behave inappropriately if deprived of their Rush fix. Get this and laugh a little, smile a lot.

Although i have only had the pleasure of seeing this Band Live one time,but was right after in my opinion their Best album was released 2112. The time machine Blu-ray Live in Cleveland Hands-Down is by far the Best Recorded performance of Rock Music I have ever scene. It is hard to phantom 2-me that these Guys(although 2-Did not age well,We all have are Faults) have become better Musicians! Also after watching this a few times now Neil Peart has got to be the Best Living Drummer Alive Today. The Drum Solo Mid-way thru this Set is worth the Price of this Blu-Ray alone. How could anybody play Drums this Good,makes all other Rock Musicians seem like they are just keeping a beat. Where Neil style of playing will always keep Him Center Stage. I saw an interview Recently with Neil Stated at the end of a Live performance He literally hurts from the Tip of His Nose Down to His Toes,If not He hasn't perform at His Best. Watch this Blu-Ray and You will surely see why. All 3-of these Musician are Gifted performers.the way Getty&Alex change instruments all thru this just blows me away playing each one perfectly. The only fault I can find in this Blu-ray after all these yrs. of singing at a high pitch Getty Voice has suffered. I am willing 2- overlook this,because His Bass playing has gotten better.

-Probably the best all-around set list to be put on a live video (subjectively)

-The audio/video sync issues that you saw in R30 and Rush in Rio are no more!

-The audio and video quality is much better than before. The audio mixing is much more oriented to a home theatre.

-The camera angles and editing are a lot better than previous live video, with better movement and fewer static shots.

-A lot of good crowd shots mixed in to really bring that energy for the viewer up

-Includes all of the shorts prior to the songs which are a lot of fun.

This is a great blu-ray. If you are a Rush fan or even just a music fan you will really enjoy showing off your system to others with this.

However, the performance on this night in Cleveland is magic beyond words. Those who know the history of Rush know the significance of the city of Cleveland to the band. From three rock icons who are pushing 60 years of age this performance proves that age means nothing. They just keep defying their critics and defying the odds.

The production on Blu Ray is top notch. Get this one soon so when you've worn it out there will still be more available!

4655891,4,B005D0RDKW,"Somehow I have made a monster blunder. I Re-listened to both DVD & Blu-ray. They are the same. The only reason that I can figure out as to why I thought incorrectly the DVD was better than the Blu-ray, the best I recall, there was nearly a 40-60 day period between me playing both versions. I have an extremely large system, dolby digital, dts, thx 6.1 Pioneer elite receiver, five power amps w/roughly 8,900 watts conservatively not counting the amps in the six berenger active powered studio monitors (225 watts rms each). I use a matching berenger stereo electronic crossover, two way w/sub output, on front monitors, woofers & subwoofer. I was going through a major upgrade on subwoofers. I build my own subs using high end subwoofers like infinity reference(2-10""s, 2-12""s), pioneer champions(4-12""s) and planet audio big bangs(a 10"" & 12""). I use old sub cabinets from earlier purchases like DCM Sub 2s, Cerwin Vega 12"" sub, and a high gloss paradyne 10"" dual port cabinet. Throw in two 10"" grey and a dual 12"" grey cabinet. I have two front and two rear subs off the effect channel. I use combinations of dual and single voice coil subs for optimum ohm loads for amps. Between crossover, receiver, and sub volume settings I must have screwed up. There is NOTHING wrong with this Blu-ray. When compared directly back to back with DVD, they are the same. This Blu-ray live concert has some outstanding picks of songs by Rush, recorded in stunning DTS-HD 5.1, like the entire uncut album 'MOVING PICTURES'. It's one of those 'you have to hear it.....or you will never believe it' things rarely ever caught live. Geddy's bass playing comes though so completely different here, so crystal clear, so incredibly dynamic, it's very much like you've never actually heard him play before. Many of the live versions you will hear here are way better than the studio versions! Keep in mind, I am comparing their ""MOVING PICTURES"" dvd-audio 5.1 deluxe edition studio to the live version on this Blu-ray. The entire live version is stunningly better. It has a great deal of Rush's early career, quite a few tracks off their 'Snakes And Arrows' CD of recent note and a few off the even newer 'Clockwork Angels' CD. Over all, I am extremely pleased with my new found re-examination for 'Time Machine' Live and absolutely love the disc. With Rush being entered into the rock and roll hall of fame shortly after this brilliant performance, it's not a stretch to believe any judge considering their fitness to HOF hearing this concert would vote Rush in instantly.",1349740800,2,2552,4.802272727272728

  The Band played great as usual, the camera angles were great, over all the whole DVD was excellent but for Geddy's vocals. They were really bad to OK throughout the DVD. He often shouted instead of sang. Real shame too as I love Moving Pictures and hope they do another DVD and play it though again but that prob won't happen.",1348358400,,568,4.299065420560748

Do yourself a favor and buy the new CD to see what I'm talking about.

4655896,5,B005D0RDKW,"That live 3 CD set called ""Different Stages"" that has the erector set pieces on the cover is fantastic too.

This particular DVD is excellent in all it's over 3 hours: Highly recommended. The only thing that didn't need to be done was for Geddy to apoligize for the 'reckless indulgence' comment at the end of 'Leave That Thing Alone' because I believe it to be one of thier best songs and I personally groove on it when they play that instrumental. I always wanted to know what the inspiration was for that song.

All of Rush's DVD's are good in one way or another especially the early stuff when they were starting out (the black and white stuff is facinating to see compared to the newer produced stuff but as they say it's progressive rock music and some of it can be construed as being a bit on the metal side of things, they should be commended for that alone but they have seen plenty of success) I still love the CD called Counterparts and it's one of my favorites! I saw them live on the Hold Your Fire tour years ago in Dallas Texas in 1988 and they lit the three balls on fire from the ceiling of the Reunion Arena and then dropped balloons all over the stadium, it was an awesom show, I still remember the lasers at that show seemed to reach out into the audience or looked like they did, I even have a DVD by them that I bought online that's called Tastes Like Chicken from a concert that was filmed by the audience and it's an awesome show even if the camera did move around too much, I trust the fans more than I do the professionals sometimes because it gives a different perspective on things.",1344556800,,1610,4.292763157894737

4655910,2,B005D0RDKW,"I'll keep this brief since most other reviewers have touched on every aspect of what I am going to say.  It's time that bands realize that if they are recording a concert intended to be released on Blu Ray, they NEED to have the audio mixed well and the video quality needs to be top-notch - is there really an excuse for that not to happen?  There is no excuse for anything less, especially if we, the fans, are expected to pay Blu Ray prices.

As for the performance, it is painfully obvious that Geddy is incapable of hitting those high notes anymore.  Sometimes I would cringe because his voice was so strained and pitch was so off.  I was perfectly happy with the musicianship of all the guys, but Geddy's (lack of) voice made this Blu Ray a 1-time-watcher for me.",1341705600,6,769,4.387323943661972

4655943,5,B005D0RDKW,"Canadian power trio Rush's brand new DVD (and off-shoot double live CD) Time Machine Live in Cleveland 2011 is a must for ALL RUSH FANS!
Recorded and filmed in Cleveland, Ohio at Quicken Loans Arena in April of 2011 just as the second leg of the Time Machine Tour was underway and sees Rush capturing a majestic show (the first time a live DVD came from a US performance although some bits of 1989's A Show of Hands album were recorded at shows in the US) into a stellar DVD.
I must confess, even as a longtime Rush fan (solid Rush fan here since 1990 and are my favorite band alongside Pink Floyd and Genesis), that some fans are starting to complain that Rush is releasing too many live DVDs and live albums (like Iron Maiden and post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and also David Gilmour) but such as life. Then others complaining about Geddy Lee's voice being off for this show (he might have either been under the weather or whatever for the show, then there are the bellyacher reviewers who must be either Britney or Gaga or Katy Perry fans). Despite Geddy's voice feeling under the weather (the 1978 portion of Different Stages in 1998 had Geddy singing with a bad cold and his voice struggled) his always excellent bass guitar playing and keyboards here more than make up for it. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is excellent as always and Neil Peart's drumming hasn't lost a step.
I'm not complaining about Rush releasing yet another live album/DVD. Thing was, I missed the Time Machine Tour due to the economy being at an all time low (and it's not getting any better folks believe me) and also Roger Waters was touring with The Wall so I went to see Roger perform The Wall in Boston (I was living in south Florida in 2010) but knowing Rush very well (and being a 20 plus year fan), I knew a live CD and DVD would come from the tour (this is the first tour I missed since the Roll the Bones Tour in 1991/92). In my view, it's a great live disc and even superb DVD and gave me a chance to hear what I missed (my father bought me the DVD this past January along with a replacement copy of the CD for my 36th birthday this past January).
There are some new tunes performed here like ""BU2B"" and ""Caravan"" which are from their forthcoming Clockwork Angels album (due in May of 2012 and cannot wait for it) but both tracks are performed much better here than the studio versions out on download (the MP3 sounded like crap). Neil's constantly evolving drum solo spot this time called ""Moto Perpetuo"" and Alex's acoustic instrumental called ""O Malley's Break"" are also excellent new ditties.
The band pull some lost nuggets out of the archives on this new live album like ""Presto"" (which had not been played live ever until the Time Machine Tour and during the recording Geddy goofed on the words but were able to fix from another show), ""Time Stand Still"" (which was last performed on the Counterparts Tour in 1994), ""Stick It Out"" (last played on the 1997 Test For Echo Tour), ""Leave That Thing Alone"" (which had not played since 2002's Vapor Trails Tour, unique to hear without it segueing into a drum solo), ""Faithless"" (which was not performed on the Snakes and Arrows Tour) and ""Marathon"" (which was last played on 1990's Presto Tour).
You also get classics that have appeared on previous live albums but done well (the opening ""The Spirit of Radio"", ""Workin' Them Angels"", ""Freewill"", ""Subdivisions"", ""Closer to the Heart"" (performed live for the first time since the one-off for Rio in 2002 with almost an Irish breakdown jig sound for the third verse rather than a by-the-numbers rendition), ""2112 (Overture/Temples of Syrinx)"", ""Far Cry"", ""La Villa Strangiato"" (this time with polka induced intro) and a unique take of ""Working Man"" which is done in a reggae beat for the first verse and part of the second verse and then goes into its normal take before ending like on Rush in Rio this time with a teaser of ""Cygnus X-1"" at the end) and all are perfomed well.
The real treat here is the whole of 1981's Moving Pictures album played start to finish. You have the staples being Side 1 of the album which had all been released on most of the live albums since 1998's Different Stages and done well (""Tom Sawyer"", ""Red Barchetta"", ""YYZ"" and ""Limelight"") plus ""Witch Hunt"" (which they had resurrected in 2007 on the Snakes and Arrows Tour), ""Vital Signs"" (last played on 2002's Vapor Trails Tour) and the best tune from the album ""The Camera Eye"" finally on a live album (last played in full on the 1981 Moving Pictures Tour). The ending of ""The Camera Eye"" features samples from Mike Myers as Austin Powers (""yeah baby yeah"") and classic Monty Python movies (Eric Idle's ""BRING OUT YOUR DEAD"" from The Holy Grail and John Cleese's ""machine that goes PING"" from The Meaning of Life) thrown in for a hilarious touch.
The DVD was brilliantly filmed by Sam Dunn (same guy who brought us the Rush documentary Beyond the Lighted Stage) and in addition to the show also comes with the screen films that were played at all shows. The first one that precedes the show with Geddy as a waiter/cook, Alex as manager Ray Ganniels and Neil as police officer O'Malley watching Rash who were dressed like Rush's 1970s selves performing polka versions of ""The Spirit of Radio"" before a device switches the band to play disco, country (hilarious) and the classic studio version before the machine goes bonkers then the band hits the stage. Then another which takes place in 1980 with Alex as manager of Rush, Geddy as Cecil the British director (complete with bad teeth) and Neil as Percy the cameraman plus a horde of beautiful German women carrying pitchers of beer and trying to shoot a video for ""Tom Sawyer"" with the Time Machine device altering every bit. The Paul Rudd bit isn't here but who's complaining (replaced by the band as they were in the first sketch performing a polka version of ""Closer To the Heart""). Then you get outtakes from the two aforementioned films plus a performance from Rush with original drummer John Rutsey playing ""Need Some Love"" and another from 1976 with the band performing ""Anthem"".
For Rush fans who are hardcore fans and who like to have a souvenir of every tour, like myself, scoop this live album up! For those who don't either like it or don't want it then stay clear.

Rush is a band that, love them or hate them, is what they are. And, now, 40 plus years on, are more who they are than ever. The new material, like BU2B, sits perfectly along side the other tracks. The audio quality is amazing, and Geddy's voice is clear unlike the last couple concert video releases, and sounds so good. He can hit the high notes, but it has a depth to it that has grown over time. You can tell the video edits were carried out by true fans... the camera follows the focus of the music. Love the steampunk theme too. Two very small complaints: the show starts off a little mellow, and I get the feeling that they worked over some of the tracks to correct bum notes. There's not a freaking off note in the whole show. Maybe they nailed everything that night, or maybe it's been dressed up a little. Anyway, that's just my producer brain yacking. 2 marks. And the next question goes to Denis Norden.",1330819200,,1105,4.421568627450981

4655948,5,B005D0RDKW,"Within the last decade there has been no shortage of full-length concert DVDs from Canadian progressive rock supergroup Rush. There was ""Rush in Rio"" in 2003, ""R30"" in 2005, and ""Snakes & Arrows Live"" in 2008, as well as 2011's feature-length documentary, ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"", produced by filmmakers/Rush fans Sam Dunn & Scott McFadyen and their company Banger Productions (VH-1 Classics' Metal Evolution, ""Iron Maiden: Flight 666"", ""Metal: A Headbangers Journey"".) It's a testament to Dunn & McFadyen's camaraderie with the band that when the time came to document this 2011 performance at the Quickens Loans Arena in Cleveland Ohio, the job went to them. It's a good thing, too. While I've been impressed in varying degrees with all of the aforementioned concert DVDs (""Snakes and Arrows Live"", in particular) I must say that this new DVD seems to be better filmed, with more of an eye towards detail. From close-up views of Alex Lifeson's guitar techniques, to Neil Peart's feet stomping out a particularly tricky bass pedal rhythm, to all the set pieces, visual jokes and video screen presentations - it's pretty obvious that this was produced by people who know and love the music.

Now, for a band with so many live DVDs on the market, does ""Time Machine"" offer anything that Rush fans haven't seen and heard before? For those who care about Rush beyond just their 'greatest hits', the answer is definitely yes. One thing that makes Rush's live shows superior to many other bands still surviving from the 70s and 80s is that Rush actually shakes-up their set-list a bit from tour to tour. Of course they don't (and shouldn't) leave out  their most well-known FM radio staples (Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Closer To the Heart, Working Man), but for this tour they even went a step further, including a complete performance of their most popular album, 1980's ""Moving Pictures"". For fans of that particular album, the performances and visual presentation of these classic tracks are all top-notch and alone worth the price of the DVD - particularly the showstopping rendition of ""The Camera Eye"", which easily surpasses the power of the studio version. But, believe it or not, the 'hits' only makes up about half of this 3 hour show. For me, and I suspect a lot of other Rush fans, the real treat with these marathon concert  DVDs is hearing some of the newer material live, and finding out which lesser-known album tracks from the past will get dusted-off for rediscovery. Keeping with the ""Time Machine"" theme, the set-list is cobbled-together from all of the band's various eras or ""phases"". ""2112 Overture/Temples of Syrinx"" and ""La Villa Strangiato"" represent  a taste of the 70's 'concept album' period, which no doubt ushered many-a-proghead onto the Rush bandwagon. The 80s 'synthesizer' period is nicely-represented here  by ""Time Stand Still"", ""Marathon"" (a personal favorite of mine) and powerful ""Subdivisions"", which serves as an emotional climax to the opening set. The title track from 1989's ""Presto"" is an unexpected (but very welcome) inclusion, providing a subdued contrast to the show's heavier moments. From 1993's ""Counterparts"" we get the tasty instrumental workout ""Leave That Thing Alone"", featuring some wonderfully nimble-fingered bass work from Geddy Lee, as well as a raucous rendition of ""Stick It Out"" which rates as one of my favorite performances on the entire DVD. 2007's ""Snakes & Arrows"" is represented by a trio of tracks, """"Workin' Them Angels"", ""Far Cry"", & ""Faithless"". All of them come across excellent in the live setting, but ""Faithless"" is a particular treat as it's wasn't included on the DVD of the ""Snakes & Arrows"" tour. There are also two nods to the future with ""BU2B"" and ""Caravan"", previews from the band's next album ""Clockwork Angels"", due in 2012. Both tracks are incrediblely gripping live, and are full to the brim with monster heavy riffs and dark atmosphere - proving that Rush's post-70's output has not always as ""soft"" as some of the band's critics like to claim.

While much could be said about the huge stage production found here (with video screens, explosions, towers of flames, comedic film skits, and even a guy in a chicken suit), the real 'show' comes from the three musicians themselves. Their on-stage energy, whether clowning around or intensely absorbed in a musical moment, is palpable and a true joy to behold. At a time when many  other vintage bands only seem to tolerate each other for the sake of money, it's obvious that Lee, Peart and Lifeson are still friends with a lot of mutual respect for one another.

From a technical standpoint, their are two sound-mixes to choose from - 2.1 Stereo or DTS. I don't have a DTS system, so can't comment on that version, but the ordinary stereo mix sounds quite full and dynamic, whether using headphones or speakers. However, I must sat that the previous DVD, ""Snakes and Arrows Live"", had a clearer 'separation' effect when listened to with headphones - at least to my ears.

All in all, this DVD should not be missed by anyone who calls themselves a Rush fan, and it certainly whets the appetite for the new album,  coming later this year.",1330473600,4,5176,4.939080459770115
4655959,5,B005D0RDKW,"It's Rush, enough said as to the quality of this DVD.  Start to finish, this is as good as it gets.

4655960,5,B005D0RDKW,My husband loved this . He sat and watched it and laughed . This is one of his favorite bands and it was a nice surprise for him .,1330300800,,130,3.5172413793103448
4655961,3,B005D0RDKW,"I've been a Rush fan since 1976 (yes I'm that old!) and, like everyone, my outlook on life has changed considerably during the intervening years.

Having always been an admirer of their musicianship, song writing and arranging skills, they are the only band/artist that I've kept up with and really listened to consistently. Sure, I still listen on the odd occasion to AC/DC (I mean, that's an exciting sound when the time is right!), but on the whole I've left bands like KISS, Judas Priest, Saxon, and Iron Maiden behind many years ago. So, that's a little background, now on to this DVD...

Rush very rarely put together new collections of material these days. There is the forthcoming album ""Clockwork Angels"" to come, but I'll get to that a little later (albeit in a short form as it's not due out until May apparently).

They have toured a lot in recent years though. ""Vapor Trails,"" ""R30,"" ""Snakes & Arrows,"" and now ""Time Machine"" were all very successful jaunts and Rush have become one of the hardest working bands around and fair play to them for that. They are taking their music to the masses like never before and are experiencing a renaissance as a result. Good for them.

I don't have a problem with the amount of DVDs they put out either. I think it's great that fans who couldn't make the concerts have a chance to see the show, even though it's through camera lenses. After all, to get to see the gig you missed over and over is a great trade-off for just under $20, right? Of course it is.

What I have a problem with is the attitude coming from the band these days. ""Snakes & Arrows"" was musically one of their best ever. Producer Nick Raskulinecz had Rush playing how most Rush fans had been yearning for them to play for years. It was a nod to ""Hemispheres"" (that chord!!), ""Permanent Waves"" (the end of ""Far Cry"" continues, for me at least, to remind me of the ending of ""Jacob's Ladder"") and almost made it to the heights of ""Moving Pictures.""  Almost.

Lyrically, it was pretty angry, but not pretty. Neil Peart's lyrics have often come in for a bashing over the years. ""2112"" was called ""crypto-facist"" by a moron at the NME, and have been called various unsavoury names by countless journalists who have long since embraced obscurity. Rush have kept on rolling unabated as has Peart.

The lyrics on ""S&A"" were a vicious broadside at religion (but mainly Christianity). Peart has become an acolyte of British, and long since discredited anti-intellectual atheist bigot Richard Dawkins, (and I say discredited because someone who peddles hatred like that immediately loses any argument they may have had - and millions of atheists are completely embarrassed by his vile nonsense). Even the new album, by all accounts, is lyrically along the same kind of lines.

So, it's a shocking development, that Peart has ""come out,"" as it were, in such a nasty way (on his blog he even mentions the pathetic ""skygod"" epithet...never thought he was a childish name-caller, but there you go). He always seemed like such a reasonable man, willing to take all things into consideration and give space to things he didn't agree with. That is obviously not the case, that's if it ever was at all.

But, finally, on to this DVD. On the special feature section there is another particularly telling moment of how ugly Peart has become in his elitism and crushing dislike of all things he doesn't agree with or like.

During a humourous intro video (Gershon's Haus of Sausage looks like a must-visit to me!), part of the script stood out as nothing more than a childish aside by Peart. During various versions of ""The Spirit of Radio"" (including a a pretty groovy 70s disco version), there is a country version. Geddy Lee's character rolls his eyes, but after ""Rash"" (the pretend house band in the video intro) finishes that version, Peart utters the sentence ""music for morons."" Unfortunately, this is typical of Neil Peart these days. He has fast become a man that dismisses entire swathes of populations as ""morons"" or ""stupid"" because they believe in certain things or listen to certain music.

Over the years, I have listened to country music and enjoyed some of it. I listen a lot to Alison Krauss & Union Station, Faith Hill, and many others. So, the questions begged Neil are: Am I a moron? Is everyone that listens to country morons?

There is a nasty elitism that Peart is infected with. He obviously feels, as does the rest of the band (or they wouldn't allow these lyrics and attitude to stand), that anyone who doesn't buy into their belief system is a ""moron."" It's inarguable as it's right there in front of us, in colour, front and centre and it's big time ugly and bigoted (and I feel so sad about it, but it can no longer be denied or ignored).

The performances on this DVD are fine, but not spectacular, efficiency personified. Yes, I know, I've left it long enough to talk about the performances (great to see ""The Camera Eye"" performed again after so many years, and it's a stand-out for sure), but certain things needed to be said, so I said them.

As for the next CD, I'll have to hear it before buying it (and that's never happened to me before with Rush). Quite frankly, however, I'm sick of being insulted for my beliefs, as well as my likes and dislikes because they don't line up with Neil Peart's or the rest of the band.

I'm probably going to get hammered by the Rush Patrol for this (""don't feed the troll,"" ""you don't have to buy Rush products"" yada yada), but I expect nothing less. Or maybe I should say, I expect nothing more.

Some of you will disagree with me vehemently, and I support your right to do so. Some of you may even agree with me, but you will be few and far between. I'm off to listen to Alison Krauss now, as a fully paid-up, card-carrying member of the ""Moron Club"" should. Bye y'all!",1329782400,5,5844,4.6038461538461535

They play Tom Sawyer to Vital Signs, straight thru, like the album.  For a real Rush fan, that is huge.

I guess you would call me an old school -> new school fan liking all, but more partial to Show Don't Tell and earlier, but I always love this band.

4655964,4,B005D0RDKW,"Having been a fan of Rush since the early 80s, I've had the pleasure to see them multiple times live.  As much as I enjoy any concert video of a group I like, I usually find those videos lacking.  It never really feels like the concert, which of course, is simply the reality watching something opposed to actually being there.  I saw Rush in Atlanta (really Alpharetta, GA) on the Time Machine tour, which was about 6 months before this show in Cleveland was filmed.  After watching this Blu-Ray, let me tell you something friend, this is as close to being at the show as I think you can get.  It's as much like being there as you can get, minus all the negatives.  The picture is amazingly clear, even for Blu-Ray.  (very glad I waited the extra time for the blu-ray release)  I personally don't have a 7.1 or even a 5.1 sound but for regular old flat screen speakers it sounds really good (it even gets a bit loud at times).  I believe the band kept the same set list through out the concert, as this was the same one I saw and read on the Rush web boards.  Why Cleveland you may ask?  It's a nod to the first US town to play Rush (""Working Man"") back in the day.  Care to guess the song the wraps up the encore?
As Moving Pictures is my favorite Rush album, this disc holds a special place in my heart.  I had hoped to catch the band a second time as they came close again, but was unable to.  Now, I feel like I can catch this magnificent show any time.  If you are a Rush fan, you simply must have this disc.  If you are a boarder line fan, I still recommend you picking it up.  Oh, just a last note, as this seems to bother some people.  The Moving Pictures album was released in early 1981, some 30+ years ago.  Since the band members are the same, they have obviously grown 30 years older.  Geddy can't quite hit the high notes that he could back then.  He's not as bad as say Roger Daltry doing ""Baba O'Reily"", but you can tell.  Just something obvious that apparently needs mentioning.
If I were to give one slight negativity, the special features are a bit slim.  They exist (2 long lost songs), but that's about it.  I hope that one day soon, we get a Rush concert that has multiple angle selections that would let you watch each individual band member.  That being said, this is one fine blu-ray.

I have been a RUSH fan for 30+ years and I have enjoyed all there live concert DVD's. The concerts are even better when you see them in Blu-Ray. A suggestion, when watching the Rush Time Machine Blu-Ray, have your home theater system set-up for true surround sound. don't use any theater enhancement setting like Music Video, Concert Hall, etc. It takes away the sound quality of the Blu-Ray.

We saw this same show live earlier in the tour, and I am enjoying the DVD of the Cleveland show every bit as much as the live act we caught in VA. The audio is so clear, you can see/here everything so well, in that sense it far surpasses the live show. So many of our favorite tunes are here, and the playing is simply superb. My son plays bass and he is crazy about Geddy (naturally!), and I play guitar and love all of Alex's work. And we are both in awe of Neil! Can't go wrong with this, it's a phenomenal tour de force from beginning to end. There will never be another band like Rush!",1326758400,,698,4.065217391304348
4655983,4,B005D0RDKW,"I didn't buy this when it came out. Normally on release day, I'm chomping at the bit but this time I was a little put off by the whole ""how many times do I have to pay for Moving Pictures?"" As more time went on, I kept reading reviews and youtube posts about how Geddy can't sing anymore and that the show was terrible. After watching, I have to disagree. I bought this because I wanted to support the band, and since no one buys the new albums anymore, this is the way they're staying in the game. I'm also a fan of Rush's sense of humor so their little skits are always worth the 17 bucks to me. I'm really happy I bought this. I watched the whole thing in one sitting and never did I get bored or think ""dear god not this song again"" I was smiling ear to ear as the boys got to jam out on parts and their usual stage antics. I thought the first set was great, and well put together. You can tell Rush has some heavy enthusiasm for the new material as BU2B was upbeat, and aggressive. Neil was playing on top of the beat and a little faster than the recorded version. Marathon was a little too fast, and to me seemed to have lost it's groove, but some impressive open handed playing by Neil in the second verse. The second set is what it is. Moving Pictures and some gems. I was disappointed to hear the new arrangement for The Camera Eye. Killer version of Witch Hunt, Alex just owns that song. Great rendition of Caravan. I'm giving this 4 stars because the audio could have been a hell of alot better. The use of surround is subtle at best and the biggest use was hearing the audience behind me. That's pretty weak. It's also compressed a bit too much. Geddy's bass can be a bit tame at times. To all the critics out there who say Geddy can't hit the high notes anymore, or even worse, can't sing anymore, I have this to say. Geddy Lee sounds amazing on the newer songs, and songs with mid to lower registers. He also nailed the high notes in freewill and alot of other songs. Faithless was flawless. The guy can sing and his voice has matured very nicely over the years. That being said, He doesn't sound like he did 30 years ago. No one over the age of 50 sounds like they did when they were 30. If you want to hear that, then please go put on the original recording or Exit Stage Left and stop complaining about the impossible. The guy is on tour for 6 to 8 months out of the year, has to sing challenging songs for 3 hours, so he has to pick his battles. I can't even say he blew the notes, he just sings it different with a ""live feel"" The songs that suffered the most were songs I've heard a thousand times anyway. You go to a Rush show, or buy their concert DVD because you want to watch these guys entertain you, not to hear the album versions. This concert rocked my socks off when I expected it not to. They have fun, can play their asses off, great versions of the tunes, and show love for their fans. A great experience live or on disc.",1326758400,11,2953,4.128472222222222
4655984,5,B005D0RDKW,"It was awesome to hear Moving Pictures live in its entirety. The new songs were great as well.  Even had some funny video clips about the ""history of Rush"".  Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan.",1326412800,,199,4.2105263157894735

I will agree, however, with some of the other reviews that the sound quality does not blow me away - hence the reason I only gave it 4 stars.  The band and the overall concert is a 5 star performance all the way.

I'm no audio expert, but in my opinion the Snakes & Arrows blu-ray has a much better mix and overall sound quality.  That being said, the content is great and well worth the purchase.",1326067200,,681,4.121212121212121

Of course, concerts are also meant to be seen, so maybe only listening gives one a hyper-critical assessment of any flaws. Watching this live performance blows that attitude away and you are swept along as if you are there. Geddy and Neil are just killing it and have gotten way better over the years. It's Alex that has gotten a bit sloppy in the live aspect. Great camera angles, super songs and wonderful concert experience.

4655988,4,B005D0RDKW,"In my opinion Rush is the greatest power trio ever. I have seen them live numerous times and they never disappoint. This new offering is great. Just hearing all of Moving Pictures is worth the price.

The blu-ray transfer is good but not perfect. The show starts off a little slow, the band has some tempo issues, and one of the cameras used on Geddy is not as sharp as the other. I don't remember what song it is but you notice Alex talking to Neil about the tempo being too fast or slow and you clearly see Neil say ""I know"". The surround and stereo mixes are very good. Great set-list and the comical videos are a bonus. The video editing at times is too abrupt for my tastes and some of the overhead shots of Neil are out of sync. Also, do we really need to see Neil's feet? Not much on bonus material but how often do you watch bonus stuff anyway?

For me, I still like Rio the best. Yes the sound was not as good but the band was on fire and Geddy's voice held up better. Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan and I hope they continue to rock out as long as they can.",1325808000,,1076,4.0233644859813085
4655999,5,B005D0RDKW,"I'm a huge Rush fan...so I'm going to totally ignore the entire issue of whether Rush really needs to put out a concert DVD & CD after every tour.  As far as I'm concerned, the answer is YES.  If you're NOT a fan, why would you care how many they produce.  And if you ARE a fan, you're probably a big fan...and thus, the more the merrier.

So how does TIME MACHINE compare to RUSH IN RIO, RUSH 30 and SNAKES AND ARROWS?  Well, each of those prior releases had issues.  RIO had some very sketchy sound mix issues, particularly in the early going...but it also beautifully capture the enthusiasm of that giant crowd.  The set list was very nice as well...I'm always happy to have ""Natural Science!""  The 30th anniversary show is, IMO, the weakest of the bunch...partially because the show is incomplete (no ""Between the Wheels!!"") and partially because the German audience is lackluster at best.  SNAKES AND ARROWS was of excellent quality, but for me, the set list was not the strongest.  I'm not a huge fan of ""Spindrift"" or ""Armor & Sword.""

TIME MACHINE has a primarily very solid sound mix.  Occasionally, there are issues, such as the nearly missing guitar in the opening third of TOM SAWYER...but overall, it's very good.  Geddy's vocals are spotty...on ""Temples of Syrinx"" he is pretty much unintelligible.  I understand the high notes he hit in the `70s are tough now (aren't they for all of us who were in high school at that time!), but it's still a bit unpleasant to listen to.  On the other hand, more current work such as ""Far Cry"" and ""Faithless"" really showcase Geddy  very nicely.

So from a quality standpoint, TIME MACHINE is right up there with the best of the other shows.  So what about the set?  Here is where TIME MACHINE really wins the 5 stars, in my opinion.  First of all, the complete MOVING PICTURES?  Are you kidding me?  If you saw the show live, perhaps you got chills like I did when ""Camera Eye"" started, finally, after all these years.  What a great 45 minutes of concert-going that all way.  And the discs have captured it very well.  Other great choices to hear include ""Presto"" and the under-rated but fantastic ""Marathon.""  And having ""La Villa Strangiato"" is always a huge plus, in my book, and they knock it out of the park.  They also have some good reggae fun with ""Working Man""...more than in the past, so that was a treat too.  The only minor grumble I have is that Neil's drum solo isn't as exciting as some in the past .  (Don't get me wrong, he's still a miracle-worker.)

So the above commentary works for the CD  (which I own), the DVD and the blu ray (which I own.)  I was going to post in the CD section, but now it appears that a posting to the CD also ends up with the bluray and vice versa.  So, here's additional thoughts on the blu ray:  it's great!  Great visuals (Rush's light show has never looked better on video) and outstanding sound.  I wish the bonus materials included the show finale with Paul Rudd and Jason Segal reprising their I LOVE YOU MAN characters, but I hear there were contractual things preventing that.  Otherwise, you might be amused at some truly vintage videos from the early `70s of Rush performing ""Anthem"" (why don't they bring THAT song back to their set list!) and ""Need Some Love.""  Also, watch through the closing credits of the concert to see and hear a Polka version of ""Closer to the Heart.""  Hilarious!

So that's my humble opinion of Rush's latest offering.  If you love this band, you already own this anyway, I'm guessing.  So all I can say is:  Not in the Rock `n' Roll Hall of Fame??  Are you kidding me!?!?!",1325635200,,3606,4.489984591679507
4656000,1,B005D0RDKW,"Purchased this brand new DVD.  It came in on time.  Video quality was superb, but there was no audio.  If this is a quality control escapee, then I'd have less of a problem than if they had no quality control at all, which I suspect is the case.",1325635200,6,245,4.0625
4656001,5,B005D0RDKW,"Yes, it's a pretty geeky sounding title, but that's really what one should be looking for in a review.  If you like Rush, you don't need me to tell you that they're great.  If you don't like them, you probably aren't reading this review, because you're probably not shopping for their DVD's.

Let me get the bottom line up front--this, by far, is the best sounding and best-looking of the Rush live DVD's (and I own all of them).  Rush is a band that has been hit and miss on the sound and video quality for their live performances.  Going WAY back to All the World's a Stage (which had very good audio, particularly for 1976/1977) to Exit Stage Left (which sounds and looks like it was recorded in a fog) to A Show of Hands (excellent sound, average video quality for 1987), they could really get it right, or really mess it up.  When they returned to live video's with Rush in Rio, they began to get the video nailed down pretty well, but the sound wasn't great--the noise from the enthusiastic crowd in a stadium detracted from the DVD.  Snakes and Arrows Live was excellent on both counts, but Time Machine is where the band finally manages to get everything pretty darn close to perfect.  Having seen them in Birmingham, UK, on the tour, this was the best sound quality I've seen them have live, and they managed to capture that on the disc.  All the instruments show up perfectly in the mix, from the rumbling bass of ""Leave That Thing Alone"" to the meaty synths at the beginning of ""Subdivisions"" for the low end to Neil's cymbals throughout the DVD and Alex's guitar on ""La Villa Strangiato"".  The video quality also is top-notch; it really does replicate the experience of being there live (or as close as you can get).

I've seen a few reviews criticizing a perceived ""jumpiness"" in the video editing.  That's somewhat justified; I'd describe the editing much like I'd describe the band's music--hyperkinetic.  Not enough to warrant dropping a star from the review, but I do wish that they would have stayed with a single camera view a little longer during some of the solos.

The closest thing to a criticism (and this isn't why I purchase a DVD), the ""extras"" are a little scanty compared to previous DVD's like Snakes and Arrows.

To sum everything up, if you are a Rush fan (or are looking to purchase this for one), you won't be disappointed.",1325548800,3,2357,4.552132701421801
4656002,4,B005D0RDKW,"Rush has never been great at video. Their DVDs are always a little pedestrian. This one is no exception. The editing is not very fancy, the extras seem more like an afterthought, and the packaging is pretty unremarkable. What is remarkable is the music. These guys sound better than ever. Now that they're bigger than God, they have the money and technology to make their sound huge and expansive. Technically, they've never been better. The setlist is excellent, but it is clearly aimed at songs that are easier to sing, and pitched a little lower. It is pretty clear that while Geddy's bass playing is still amazing, he's a little old to be screeching like that banshee he once was. He barely makes it through tracks like Spirit of Radio and 2112. Still, its Rush, and who knows how many more chances we might have to see these guys live. Rush's music is the soundtrack to my life, and when they finally hang it up, a little bit of me will die.",1325548800,,946,4.505813953488372
4656003,5,B005D0RDKW,....But this is the next best thing! Absolutely one of their best videos for sure! Their skits are quite a hoot! I almost expect to see them in other movies soon... they're becoming pretty good actors as well as being the best band on the planet! I definitely won't miss the next tour!,1325462400,,285,4.39622641509434
4656004,4,B005D0RDKW,"I have been a fan of Rush for around 23 years, starting at age 15.  I have always loved Rush's music, even if I didn't agree with the lyrics and (lack of) beliefs.  However, let me tell you, this concert DVD was more than enough to win me, or any other serious music fan, over time and time again.  From 'Faithless' to 'Marathon', the sheer skill, intensity, and joy in playing the music just radiates off all three of the boys throughout the DVD's setlist.  The chops are as solid as ever, the synths and guitars sound the best they ever have, and Neil's performance is simply stellar throughout.  During the concert, it's so great to see Geddy and Alex interact with each other, Neil, and the audience.  They create this kind of energy that lets you KNOW that they are the best rock'n roll band in the world.

My only problem with the DVD was (just as it was in the concert) are the Time Machine themed movie shorts.  I never quite get Rush's quirks or humor; maybe it's just me.  It was simply a let down for me, I suppose.  It's true that their music and lyrics and sophisticated enough that the movies serve as a sort of 'comic relief', but it just doesn't work for me.  I actually liked the seemingly stoic (well, relatively speaking) A Show of Hands VHS and DVD.  Having said all of this, if you are into Rush's humor, then the Time Machine DVD will not disappoint.

The sound and quality of the DVD seem reasonable.  I played the DVD through a 42"" HDTV without surround sound, so I cannot make too many comments about the technical merits of the DVD.  The concert presentation of lighting seemed very, very good; just being able to see the gear and Geddy, Alex, and Neil's hadn and foot work, respectively, made for the best visuals.  Again, though, I was not into most of the concert backdrop visuals, aside for those for maybe Subdivisions.  The Moving Pictures figures just seem odd.

Thanks to this DVD and my memories of the 2010 tour, I just can't say enough good things about Rush.",1325462400,,1996,4.436813186813187
4656005,3,B005D0RDKW,"I own all Rush DVDs.: RIO, R30,Rush3X,Snakes & Arrows and now Time Machine.
I am frankly a little disapointed. I am 47 years old, I have been listening to Rush since I am 10 years old,(I have two older brothers who were in their teens when Rush's debut album came out). I still think that RUSH is the best Rock band ever.

This DVD disapoints me. The venue is less attractive, The cinematography and editing seems to have been done without any real heart into it. The songs rush through with what seems to me like haste. At one point Alex nods to Neil that they are half way. Like they can't wait for the concert to finish! Rush seems less professional. To me the best Rush Concert on DVD is still the Snakes & Arrows one. There they seem more in top form.",1325116800,3,756,4.25
4656006,5,B005D0RDKW,"I love the potential of blu-ray to offer high resolution audio and fill the void left by dvd-a and sacd. Unfortunately, that hasn't materialized. However, the live concert ""movie"" is an excellent opportunity to see and hear what blu-ray audio could be. So far I have not found many discs that wow, but the Time Machine concert is certainly one of them. It's not as tight or as ""clean"" as say Jeff Beck at Ronnie Scotts (which is maybe the best on blu so far) or as sonorous as David Gilmour's Remember that Night but it's Rush and it Rocks. Video is generally excellent, but I buy these for the audio and this disc doesn't disappoint. The sound is clear, the bass is strong and Geddy's voice is not buried nor is it out in front of the music. My only complaint is there is a bit more audience noise than I'd like. This is a live concert and that is to be expected and for the most part they do a great job of suppressing the audience during the music, but this was recorded in a huge venue so there is the occasional yell or whistle that makes it's way to front (no where near as bad as Rush in Rio). If you are a fan of Rush and have a system that can take advantage of the DTS HD Master Audio then you should pick this up and then crank it up. You might also want to check out the blu-ray release of Moving Pictures which is outstanding.",1325030400,3,1339,4.153846153846154

I saw some reviews on I-tunes about Geddy's voice..Noticed nothing here..He sounds strong, very strong on the Blu-ray. The heart stopping pause rewind part for me is the encore. La Villa and Working Man are incredible. Alex throws down. Amazing stuff.

This disc brings home the excitement of watching a top band perform flawlessly LIVE (without needing ear-protection) AND they played all my favorites. Other reviewers have successfully dissected the performance, song by song, so I'll skip that. The clever 'time machine' theme in the stage settings as well as the imaginitive vignettes(featuring the band members)add an element of humor that makes this performance by these 'old-guys' laugh-out-loud memorable.

I have caught every tour show since then as I have grown older and moved from Indy to KC now to Portland,with career and pursuit of happiness this band,its members never fail to inspire me in my personal goals as well as in my career goals to achieve as much happiness doing what I love more than any other type of input from people, books, or film.  The crowds include  so many people that truly value the musicianship , entertainment RUSH has always delivered equally and if not more than myself.  Geddy's vocals are better than ever , Alex in particular on this tour really brings out his guitar master playing with some very cool classical guitars, and old acoustic folk instruments ( lead in on Closer to the Heart in particular).  Neal as we have been so honored to always witness astounds us, with his drumming , deep thought lyrics , and what do you know the guys can act too ;)

These guys never skimp when it comes to production values. The Video is as crisp as it can be, and the 5.1 stereo is great if you have the equipment to play it.

I enjoy shutting off the lights and my phone and watching the performance, it is the closest to actually experiencing being at the show.

I really enjoyed some of the obscure stuff like the Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs.

I think this would be a good way to initiate some of the youngsters, which I do see at the concerts with their Dads.

My only complaint (and I use that term very lightly) Id Gedd's vocal performance. It seems better on the DVD than on the CD. He cracked a few times, which most people wouldn't catch

The video quality is high (although there is some digital distortion from time to time) and they tried to shoot from different perspectives than previous concert videos. So there are some refreshing shots. The sound is excellent (as one would expect).  The video is a snap shot of this particular tour, and by its nature some of the songs have appeared in every other Rush concert video. My favorite songs are those that they pulled out of the vault or changed around some.  The hits (while performed well) have been released too many times. I'd tell them to pull out a few more songs from the vault and leave the hits off the next one.  As much as I love the songs, how many times do I need to see Tom Sawyer or Limelight live?  The bands video skits are comical and it is nice to know that they do not take themselves too seriously.

If you are a bass player and you haven't listened or seen Geddy Lee..Get A Move! Alex and Neil are of course excellent too. This one solid unit. My favorite group since I stopped buying KISS albums in the 1970's when I was a kid. For such an intellectual band they have a genuine humility and sense of humour.,1323648000,,479,4.052631578947368

I was pleased to hear the whole Moving Pictures, Witchhunt & Camera Eye sounded great. Presto & Time Stand Still were also nice to hear. They played enough odd songs to make you happy.

Whether you love or hate their music you can respect the band members as utterly talented instrumentalists who (publicly) mock themselves. Prog rock is always criticized as being ""pretentious"" but Rush turns that characterization on its head. They perform dazzling music while appearing to enjoy and laugh at it. Name me another band that is similar...

The audience likely isn't quite aware of the skill required to perform at the level they do. To bake in the added humor only demonstrates more-so the fact that Geddy, Alex, and Neil are very humble folk with very uncommon talent.

At nearly 60 years-old these guys energetically outperform their grand-kids.

4656071,5,B005D0RDKW,"I have seen many live videos before, but none of them have been like this! What a show the Canadian power trio puts on. This video has the amazing audience of Rush in Rio, and the quality of R30 and Snakes and Arrows Live. It all starts out with the humorous intro during the tour that reviews the history of a Canadian band named Rash. Then exploding on the stage with The Spirit of Radio the band and crowd are in perfect sync. Second is Time Stand Still which is what you what time to do while watching this DVD. The first set continues with songs old and new including old favorite Freewill and with drum fills that may even top Tom Sawyer the new BU2B. The second set includes all of Moving Pictures, Caravan, a Neil Peart drum solo, Closer to the Heart, 2112, and Far Cry. For the encore they play La Villa Strangiato and Working Man (My favorite version of it so far.) So as you can see if you are a huge fan of Rush or have just heard some of their songs on the radio this is a good investment of 3 hours and $20.",1323043200,2,1021,4.11
4656072,5,B005D0RDKW,"Recorded in Cleveland, this DVD is perhaps the best that Rush has offered in terms of video quality, stage theatrics and camera work. If you did not see Rush on the Time Machine tour, this is a highly accurate representation of what you could expect to see if you had. Objectively, the set list choice was a decent one and certainly one where classic numbers are going to be included, e.g. ""Spirit of Radio"", ""Tom Sawyer"", ""YYZ"" and ""Limelight"". Therefore, if you were just watching this DVD, having never seen ""Rush In Rio"", ""R30"" or ""Snakes and Arrows (Live)"", it would be all brand new. Realistically, on the other hand, it is no different than seeing Rush in concert, 10 or 15 times.

The musicianship is excellent and despite reports of Geddy having a cold that night, he delivered a very respectable performance for a highly demanding job. There was much more ""looseness"" and clowning around among the three during the show. I suspect that this was recorded at/towards the end of the tour, noting Alex mouthing ""halfway"" to Neil Peart during Subdivisions, which marked the halfway point in the show.

Clearly, in this performance, Rush exemplified their love for not only their music and fans but the bond between them onstage/off. The comedy skits at the beginning of the DVD, intermission and end are all priceless. Everyone knows that Alex and Geddy can be pretty hysterical on their own....but this time, 'ol Elwood joins in on the fun. Yes, Mr. Peart, everyone knows that you did not lose your sense of humour in life and that you have been able to smile again...most likely because of The Blessed Event mentioned in Far and Away: A Prize Every Time... It is definitely a worthwhile experience to see Neil take part in this.

Personally, if the set list was up to me, I would have diversified it a little more. Although I really liked ""Camera Eye"", parts of it that were recorded in the studio were just too complex to reproduce live on stage, without using a lot of sequenced parts. I would also say that nearly every album was covered but not all. I also think that Rush has....and this is only constructive criticism, overplayed some of these songs in the last four ""live"" albums because four out of the last five albums WERE ""live""....There were two new tunes, BU2B and Caravan which were included on this DVD, which were pretty good. Hopefully, Rush will complete that new album soon and tour again.

Another high note for this DVD and huge crowd in Cleveland is the diverse age range of Rush fans. There were many younger people there as well as people who grew up with Rush in their adolescence. It's remarkable to see just how many people have been touched by their music.

I recommend this DVD and give it a high-five stars. If you wanted to see Rush on this tour but couldn't....or have just never seen them, you need to have this.",1323043200,2,2852,4.639603960396039
4656073,5,B005D0RDKW,"I was at the show in Cleveland the night they filmed this DVD.  It was a great show, but like all concerts, where you sit has a direct effect on how you hear the music.  I didn't have the best seats in the house so the sound mix, while I am sure it sounded great in the headset of the front of the house mixer, was not the best from my vantage point.  Watching the DVD and remembering the show as I saw it live allowed me to hear everything I missed at the live performance.  That being said, for Rush fans this is a must see.  They played Moving Pictures in its entirety, included 2 songs from their upcoming album (BU2B and Caravan), plus revived some previously retired performances (Closer to the Heart) and some that I believe may never have been played live before this tour (Presto).  In true Rush style and with an incredible sense of humor, they included some skits with that are sure to tickle your funny bone.

One of the things I like best about the live show was seeing fans as young as 8-9 years old attending the show with their parents.  But not just that they were there, they were really into the music.  It is nice to see older Rush fans introducing their children to this incredible rock band.

I haven't listened to the stereo version and I don't think I ever will, but I'm sure it is very good too. Rush = quality.
If Amazon had 10 stars I would give it 10 stars. No need to describe the concert, others have done that already. The way they play music so intricate and complex is close to mayhem and disaster, yet song after song they nail it, while making it look easy. Chaos controlled!",1322265600,9,686,4.3671875
4656075,4,B005D0RDKW,"After watching the Time Machine DVD, I was impressed once again with the band's unbelieveable musicianship. Rush is spot on musically here - I don't think their playing has ever really sounded better in all the time I've been going to see their shows. Some of the usual live Rush humor is there, but it's mostly contained within the ""history of Rush"" segments at the beginning and middle of the show. Unfortunately the characters from ""I Love You, Man"" don't show up at the end like at the show but this is a small detail.

Highlights for me include Freewill, La Villa Strangiato, Leave That Thing Alone, and Caravan. Naturally there are plenty of good things to say about Moving Pictures, but most of them have been said already.

The setlist is pretty aggressive, which is a definite credit to the band. I quite like the way Rush has been recording live performances as of late, which is to include the entire performance rather than to select certain songs for inclusion onto the album. Of course with that come a few rough edges, but that's to be expected sometimes. I saw Rush twice on this tour and Geddy sounded better vocally to me on those occasions than this one, but it's still an excellent momento of the tour.

One thing I was not clear on is in the sound set up area of the dvd. It looks like you can choose between 5.1 and Dolby, but after you select one it doesn't really look like you've made a selection for sure. I'm sure it does what you tell it to do but it just seemed a little bit ambiguous to me.

Overall, a great DVD...recommended.",1322265600,2,1557,4.4526315789473685

This disc in particular highlights their popularity, as the boys played their most popular album, ""Moving Pictures,"" front to back, in addition to some new material never heard before.

Obviously, one disc cannot fully capture the energy and excitement of seeing Rush live, but this disc is a close second.  If you're reading this review, you probably are a Rush fan, anyway, and knowing Rush fans, you are probably considering buying it anyway, so I say go for it.  But if you're simply a fan of music, and great live music in particular, you could do a lot worse than checking out this disc.

Having actually seen the DVD product, I can say it is a good one. Rush never disappoints. The opener was quite entertaining, showing the sense of humor from a band who has weathered the decades well, maintaining virtuosic quaity to their musicianship. Endless camera angles plus 5.1 sound add up to a great live collection, one faithful to one of their best tours ever. I few extra photos in the booklet would have been nice, but definitely a buy for fans of all ages.

4656112,4,B005D0RDKW,"To start with: the sound and video quality is fine. But the booklet and bonus section is for he birds compared with the bonus material of RIR or R30 (DVD). What bugs me is nearly the same revolving set-list over the last 10 years of live performing. Joining Rush since Exit stage left, I never missed a show in my local hometown arena Frankfurt Festhalle in Germany. But I am afraid that Rush has lost a little bit of their creative musical spirit ending up after T4E era. Thereof excluded are the composition of >R30 Overture< which is state of the art and the highly energetic instrumental >Malignant Narcissim<.

In the last decade of playing live, Rush was always focused on nearly the same stuff combining it with 2-4 songs of ""new"" material (here BU2B and Caravan). The latest shots of Red Barchetta, Camera Eye and Vital Signs are excellent, but Far Cry and Workin` them Angels among others were just filmed on Snakes and Arrows before. And from my point of view >Stick it out< and >Faithless< are nothing to write mother home about if you think about the excellent and diversified track record 40years down the road (e.g. Manhattan Project, Territories, The Weapon, Analog Kid, Prime Mover, Test for Echo, Cut to the Chase etc.). Also a live performance of <Where is my Thing?> would have be a great replacement for >Leave that thing alone< which was already released on Different Stages and RIR.
I know - all in all - it`s always an individual issue. But one is for sure: I don`t need CD and/or DVD compilations with nearly the same stuff again and again (see also release of >Working Man best of Rush Live<) when there is such a huge and fantastic material existing. Songs which never had been played and/or released as live versions.

It is hard to criticise an Icon, but I hope that there will be a real (!) change of the set-list some sunny day. Nevertheless, Rush still rocks ...!",1321488000,3,1894,4.600591715976331

4656114,5,B005D0RDKW,"It was with mixed feelings that I awaited the delivery of my Blu-Ray of Time Machine 2011: Live In Cleveland.  I had purchased the CD/MP3's from Napster the day it came out and was a bit underwhelmed.  Geddy's vocals were a bit lacking and I thought that age had begun to caught up with him.  I thought the CD was a fine momento for those who actually went to the show and little more.  I had seen this show at the end of the first leg, and I thought the performance in West Palm Beach was better than what I was listening to on my I-pod.

I gave that CD three stars basically saying that those who wanted a souvenir of the tour, it was worth the cash, but on it's own merits, there was better live versions of most of the songs out there.  I still stand by that review.  Many others as well reviewed the CD similarly so I know I'm not alone in that thought.

My Blu-Ray arrived a week later.  Ok, I thought, you know what it sounds like, but at least you'll like the visuals.  My expectations were definitely lowered.

I was blown away.  Don't get me wrong, this is the exact same tracks that are on the CD's.  There are a few seconds of dialog missing from the CD and the CD is broken up between Limelight and Camera Eye, whereas the Blu-ray keeps the intermission intact.  I certainly can hear some of the same weaknesses that I heard on the CD.  Time Stand Still has some cringe inducing moments.  But for some reason, maybe it's the DTS surround mix, Maybe it's watching them play as well as listening to the content, but for whatever reason, Geddy's vocal weaknesses are not as apparant in the Blu-Ray as they are in the CD.

I am not an audiophile by any means, so I can't really critique the ""mix"" or any other aspects others here may be able to critique more effectively.

As a Rush fan, I simply love this Blu-Ray.  I have both Rush in Rio and Snakes and Arrows Live on DVD.  Rush in Rio is a great concert video but the camera shots are too short and don't seem to linger on the band long enough and seem almost random in their cut aways.  Snakes and Arrows Live is a much better show.  It's looks and sounds much better, though the crowd in Holland can't compare to 40,000 brazillians, however the Snakes and Arrows Setlist is not one of my favorites.  The Time Machine tour show is simply amazing.  The concert is filmed brilliantly and the shots are logically situated, focusing on a band member at the appropriate time.  Whether it's Neil doing a fill-in, Alex doing a solo on the Mandolin, or Geddy performing a bridge on the synth, the camera tracks whatever band member is dominant at the time.

Overall, his Blu-Ray provides a completely different experience than the CD.  I'll continue to listen to the CD as it is a portable version of this fine show.  But as far as an over all experience this Blu-Ray just blows the CD and most other Rush Concerts I've seen filmed out of the water.  So much so, that I barely notice that Geddy is not at his prime vocally.  Musically, the band here is in top form.

If you went to this show then you'll want to pick up both the CD and the Blu-Ray/DVD as you'll want a portable version of this show to listen to in the concert, or while working out, or wherever you are.

However if you only want to buy one version of this show, then this Blu-Ray is the only way to go.  It is amazing.  And finally, if you already purchased the CD and were somehow disappointed, then I suggest you buy the video.  It's hard to figure out but it's on a magnitude better than than the audio only version.  Someone tell me I'm wrong.  I just can't believe that I'm listening to the same performance.  And yet there it is, the Blu-Ray/DVD blows the CD out of the water and I have no idea why.

A definite must have!!!!",1321228800,3,3755,4.264872521246459
4656115,4,B005D0RDKW,"I've seen Rush many times over the years and they have never disappointed. This video is no exception. Probably my favorite setlist of all time. Throw in Xanadu and The R30 overture and I'd be in heaven. I'm being greedy. The only problem I'm having with this DVD, and maybe it's just me. I can't get the audio to play if I select 5.1 in setup. It will only play in dolby 2.0. Any other Rush DVD I have will play in 5.1 if chosen on any DVD player in the house. Took my 1st copy back to Best Buy and got another with the same results.

My only complaint is that the song selection sucks! Coming from 40+ shows going back to Hemispheres I'm sick and tired of everything on MP but Camera Eye. Come on guys. Get rid of every ""hit"" and give us a B sides live. Please!

No Blu-Ray will ever substitute for being at the show live.  But this is a great momento of that tour.  The audio is fine and the videography is VERY fine !  It is so much better than Rush In Rio, which I think is a visual disaster.  The boys are right on the money with their respective playing.  My only negative comment is Geddy's voice:  it's not able to meet the demands of the early work, and at times, it's just not good.  He slurs lyrics like Elton; if I didn't know the words, I'd have no idea what he was saying.  Time waits for no one, so give him a break on his vocals and instead, enjoy the tight riffs and the genuine commaraderie shown between the three of them while they are playing.  Best Buy has this in stores right now for $19.99.  I'm not sure why Amazon has a Decemember release date on this ?",1321056000,8,937,4.191011235955056
4656118,5,B005D0RDKW,"I am mystified as to why the person who wrote the most ""helpful critical review"" had such a problem with the sound mix of the fantastic Blu-Ray. As Rush has progressed over the years when it comes to releasing their concert video's, they really started to hit the nail on the head when the released R30 a few years ago. Since then, every concert video to date...Beyond the lighted stage, Snakes and Arrows, and now ""Time Machine"" has been excellently produced, both in video and audio quality. The video especially is wonderfully done, showing different camera angles that I had never seen in a prior Rush video. The audio mix, is amazingly balanced, a lot of good punch on the low end from Geddy's bass and Neil's drum kit, and the high's of Alex's guitar soar through the video. I don't consider myself an audio file, but I play various instruments, so I feel that I have a pretty good ear. Maybe the prior reviewer doesn't have the greatest sound system, or maybe he has his settings off, but I couldn't really tell that there were any really noticeable audio adjustments throughout the video. For me, it was off the hook the entire concert and as of yet, I haven't found a pause in the video like I have seen in a lot of other productions. Compared to ""Rush in Rio"" this DVD blew that one away, as I stated before, that the band and their crew have really learned how to put together a wonderful concert video.

My biggest question is why Amazon is not releasing the Blu-Ray version until late December, when other store(s) have already put it on the market for sale. Unusual, since Amazon always seems to release titles along with their competition at the same time. So that makes me scratch my head a little. But I will continue to use Amazon, since I can find anything here that I need, and usually for quite a bit cheaper price.

In closing, this DVD is a MUST for any Rush fan or casual fan......it just blew me away!! And it is a nice memory for me, since I wsa fortunate to see them on the first leg of the ""Time Machine Tour"".

Thank you Rush for many years of great music and for documenting this amazing concert. You really out did yourselves this time. I can't even imagine how you could top this show. Everybody enjoy!!!!",1320969600,6,2237,4.451219512195122
4656119,4,B005D0RDKW,"The only downside to seeing Rush live, be it in person or on DVD or Blu-Ray, is that they perform long concerts with lots of new material that people don't care for.  You get the best of Rush side by side with songs that you would like to fast-forward through.

Truly, Rush are a nostalgia band.  Seeing them on the Snakes and Arrows tour, I thought it was an hour too long.

But, the band is doing what they should be doing - touring new material, otherwise they wouldn't have much reason to continue.

Go see them live and buy the Blu-Ray to see the close-ups of what you may have missed.  Apart from Geddy not singing as well as he did years ago, these guys are still a force to be reckoned with.",1320969600,,699,4.17910447761194
4656120,5,B005D0RDKW,"As a 50 year young RUSH fanatic, having seen them live 45 times in 4 states since 1977, I have come to expect a lot from Geddy, Alex, and Neil in terms of their music and their live concerts. This is one classic rock band that has raised the bar for many others in terms of their quality music, studio perfection, and killer live shows. This 'Live In Cleveland' show is no exception. It delivers in every way! There is the very humorous 'time machine' vignettes that are part of the live show, that are seamlessly intertwined with the live music, and the infectious smiles and banter between the band. The audience was 'on fire' and clearly enthused and entertained. The DVD editing is superb, with just the right dose of great closeups of the 3 maestros performing magic on their instruments, the animated audience, and whole stage and arena shots. There are also a few 'extras', mainly a vintage video of 'Anthem' being performed at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ way back in the stone ages, and out-takes and bloopers from the 'time machine' vignettes. If you like Rush, this is a 'must own'.  If you don't like Rush, this is a 'must own' as well!",1320969600,81,1154,4.548076923076923
4656121,4,B005D0RDKW,"The Time Machine tour was highlighted by the celebration of the Moving Pictures's CD 30th Anniversary. The band played the entire cd at the beginning of the second set. Also they decided to play back some songs that have not been play for a long time, like ""Marathon"" and ""Time Stand Still"". For the first time, we can hear the song ""Presto"", live. The rest of the set contains classics songs covering all the decades, including the two new songs; ""BU2B"" and Caravan"". The playing of the entire Moving Pictures cd was a opportunity to hear for the first time in 30 years, ""Camera Eye"". But at the same time, we have to endure again the same songs that the bands put on all his tours, i am talking about ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"", who are favorites among the majority of fans, but not for me. The two new songs are not great songs, but had to be put on the set list here.

For the performance, the band was full of energy, happy to be there, if we take a look at the cameras that was catching the looks and funny faces that each member through at each other, especially obvious in the song ""Free Will"", with Neil and Alex. The editing filming is excellent by giving us some camera shots at the right spot and at the right moment.

The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is very good, maybe not as good as Snakes and Arrows, but this is not a issue here. The DTS-HD sound is excellent with a full surround sound and a clear mix of all instruments. As for the extras, it's rather short and not memorable. I would have prefer to see more recent footage instead of some old archives stuff where the picture quality is poor, like they did on Snakes and Arrows.

So this Blu-Ray is excellent, because it's made by a great band that have survived together all these years with a impeccable musicianship. I can only be a little fussy about the set list, that's what happened when you listen too much to a band's music... Recommended!",1320883200,,1923,4.380952380952381

4656189,5,B005D0RDKW,"I go to concert filmings as a hobby. I like picking myself out in the crowd shots. I was close at the U2 360 tour Rose Bowl show and U2 Vertigo tour - Chicago. I saw the Time Machine tour five times; three times on the first leg in Milwaukee, Chicago and St. Louis, and again in Chicago and this show in Cleveland on the second North American leg. I was sitting in the first row of the upper section next to Alex and wore an LED equalizer shirt that lit up and had a built-in mic that reacted to the music in my continuing shameless attempts to appear in concert videos. I could see me here and there in the video, just under the circular LED lighting truss over Alex.

Rush took a calculated risk filming this show. Most concerts are filmed over two nights. They shot this in one night. Good move - I think it kept them on their toes. They were on their game for this performance. Probably one of the tighter shows I saw this tour. Saw it this past week at the local multiplex and was pretty impressed. One of the better Rush performances captured on video.

The crowd was energetic. They had a grid of wedge-shaped lighting trusses mounted over the entire audience, which were lit most of the show. Think ""Show of Hands"" on steroids. More light thrown on this crowd than other rock shows I've seen filmed. Adds a new dimension to the show on video as the moving lights over the audience were in sync with those over the stage. The editing was done at reasonable pace.

My personal favorite was ""The Camera Eye"". I read somewhere that Geddy thought the song was ""too dated"" for inclusion in previous tours. He was surprised to find that he really enjoyed playing it on this tour. This song got a strong response from the crowd each time I saw it played. I think it is personal favorite of many Rush fans. Juxtaposition of the rear videoscreen cityscapes intercut well with the live performance. They really nailed it here. Geddy knew it too when he let out a yell and threw his hands up at the very end of the song. Lightning captured in a Blu-ray bottle.

They had a camera mounted underneath this motorized mini-blimp they flew around the venue. The camera is lower resolution than the other hi-def cameras and made for some interesting shots. Hand helds running around the audience captured one amazing air-drumming performance after another. Many songs end with a wide shot taken from the nose-bleed seats in the rear upper deck. The venue was small and it makes for a nice panoramic view they return to often.

Highlights include a blistering bass solo by Geddy to finish off ""Leave that thing alone"". Geddy also hits the high notes of ""Freewill"" as if it were 1980 again. The ""Moving Pictures"" section works well as each song is framed and intercut with their backing video.

Every conceivable angle of Neil's always-excellent solo is covered as he amazes us mere mortals with his awesome display of muscle memory hyperdrive.

Geddy is shown mouthing along to various dialog samples he triggers throughout the show. I never really noticed many of these live, but it's pretty funny in the video. You can always tell how well a Rush show is going by the looks they give each other on stage and the faces they make when they flub something. Alex is once again quite the mugger on camera this show as he thrashes through the setlist with his usual intensity. Neil never misses a stick.

I thought they had a great light show this tour. Everything looked and sounded great on the DLP video projection system I saw it on, so crank it up sit back and experience rock nirvana as the LED chase patterns streak across the undulating spider-like legs of the main rig during ""Vital Signs"" and ""La Villa Strangiato"" - It's a beauty way to go.",1320451200,4,3736,4.5081240768094535

I can offer a review of that venue: good place to go to watch LeBron James throw down thunder dunks, boring place to see a concert.  I did see several concerts there while I lived in Cleveland (Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins, The Who, Tom Petty, Roger Waters), but those arena shows are all the same.

4656192,4,B005D0RDKW,"I saw the Blu-Ray of this show last night.  This was projected using a Panasonic theater-grade projector (the logo came up before the showtime) and the Blu Ray was the consumer version that will be released in December (I know this because the menu came up before the showtime).  This review will be based on what I saw, and since I have no control over how that theater calibrated their projector, I cannot say with certainty if any of the flaws were due to the Blu Ray itself, or the projector/sound system.  But here goes.

Sound-wise, things don't start out that impressively, but get progressively better as the show progressed.  At first the sound was a bit flat in terms of dynamics and a bit soft.  The bass lacked punch, and I didn't feel like I was at the show, but watching a show.  The sound was clean, I could hear no feedback or hiss, and I could hear the spaces between the sounds.  Eventually the sound mixers at the concert must have made some corrections because the sound improved from ""okay"" to ""very good"", at least for a live concert.  There wasn't any obnoxious use of sound imaging, just some ambient crowd noise, nothing flying from one speaker to the next.  Instrumentally, Geddy's bass and Alex's guitars sounded the best--dynamic, never shrill or piercing.  Solos aside, Neil's drums were just a tad undermixed--perhaps this was intentional as his drumming style can be so dominant.  Overall, the sound level definitely got louder and louder as the concert progressed--several people remarked on it after the show.

Picture wise this was excellent, but with a definite bias towards blue overall.  Flesh tones looked as natural as they can under the ""limelight"".  I saw no evidence of edge enhancement or processing, this was probably just directly loaded from the HD cameras without much interference.  Some of the longest shots (and the occasional ""blimp"" shot) were of slightly lesser picture quality, but this could have more to do with the slow build-up of smoke in the venue.  The opening and end credits were of low quality and jagged edges were visible.  The non-concert film clips were pretty much perfect, with some minor smearing during intentionally hokey special effects segments involving the time machine tranformations.

Overall, this was an exciting, involving show that had the theater crowd cheering along with the projected crowd.  The sound started out iffy but steadily improved to very good.  The picture is likely the best we have seen in a Rush concert so far.",1319673600,47,2512,4.877358490566038
4656193,5,B005D0RDKW,"Saw this concert film in its theatrical release on October 26, 2011.

For guys pushing 60, the boys in Rush have the enthusiasm and stage energy of guys half their age.  Their enthusiasm is infectious, with the band and the audience feeding off each other.

This is a remarkably high-energy show, and the numerous cuts to the crowd show fans of all ages obviously having a wonderful time (as evidenced by the near-constant smiles on their faces).  For such a large arena show, it feels surprisingly intimate.

The band mines the depths of their extensive catalog with the setlist, including the title track from the album ""Presto"", and pull a suprising amount of energy out of ""Marathon"" from the album ""Power Windows"".  I don't think they did any songs from ""Grace Under Pressure"", but IIRC they may have hit almost every album from ""2112"" forward, plus ""Working Man"" as the final encore.

In both the concept videos and the live show the band plays around with the arrangements of a few of their best-known songs:  listen up for brief polka, disco, and country arrangements of ""The Spirit of Radio"", among other treats.

The lighting rig above the stage resembled spider legs at times.  It looked expensive and elaborate, but for all its mobility I didn't notice a marked visual impact on the stage or show itself.

The cameras capture the three performers having a great time playing jovially alongside each other, and even a few instances where they appear to engage individual members of the audience for a moment and a laugh.  I can't recall ever seeing another band enjoy their time onstage together as much as Rush does, and they've been at it for nearly 40 years (current line-up).

Neil's drum solo occurs about midway through the second half of the show, and despite some slight inconsistency in the rhythm of his hi-hats (an observation, not a criticism) he delivers on the promise of his reputation as one of rock's finest drummers.  He once again ends with a nod to the Big Band era.

Geddy's bass work still impresses:  his improvisational ""fills"" sound intricate and effortless at the same time.  Too bad his vocals get a little buried in the sound mix (unless that was due to limitations of the movie theater's sound system).

With the concept videos, the concert runs darn close to 3 hours -- but never drags for even a moment.  The DVD and Blu-ray feature some additional concept video footage and some archival concert footage from the 1970's.

Highly recommended viewing, even if you can't watch it on a 30 foot-high screen like I did.",1319673600,2,2556,4.765909090909091
4656194,3,B005D0RDKW,"My love of Rush began with Hemispheres, so I have seen and heard it all.  I just saw the theatrical release of this movie and it's a step up from the quality of their concert films of late.  It's always boggled my mind that a band that has cut such a definitive and noteworthy swath for themselves has really dropped the ball when it comes to their concert films.  In general, the editing seems to follow the lyrics instead of the music.  While there are many parts that cut to the appropriate member for their requisite riff/solo/transition, there were at least 4 times where they cut away from Neil's full riff.  Even when they stayed on the appropriate member for their riff, why do they feel the need to cut to a different (often inferior) angle right in the middle of it?  There's some comfort in the fact that we know Neil's solo will get center stage, but the camera work in general is not superior.  Overall the cutting is too ""energetic"", and I'd love to see a cut of a concert film that lingers a bit longer here and there instead of succumbing to MTV editing.

There are many great moments on this disk, though.  I counted numerous goosebumps, and I got particular pleasure from the shot of kids in the audience who really seem to be enjoying themselves.  There's a special magic about the band that comes from almost 40 (!) years of following their hearts, and that energy comes through in their performance.  There are some spectacular moments here, chief among them the jam on Working Man in the encore.  While the guys may have thickened a bit over the years, there's no other band that rocks as hard and as true as these guys.  Also, their newer material comes across particularly well, probably since it's more within their current habits and vocal ranges.  BU2B and Caravan are both blistering.  But old standards sound great, with Freewill and Subdivisions really shining.  Honestly I could have done without parts of Moving Pictures, like The Camera Eye, but since this was a historical inclusion, there it is.  Witch Hunt was surprisingly solid, and the lyrics fit now more than ever).

If you love the band, you'll likely love this movie.  There are also some very entertaining bumpers featuring the band (it makes so much sense that Neil is the cop) and a couple of very funny ""oom-pa"" versions of Rush songs.

I'd always give 5 stars to the band, but this video gets 3-1/2.",1319673600,13,2397,4.595294117647059
4656195,5,B005D0RDKW,"Just came from seeing this on the national theater release night. In my case it was at the Arlington MA ""Regent Theater"" - a theater that has shown Rush rocumentaries in the recent past (and hosted the excellent Rush tribute band ""Lotus Land"" who opened last year for the ""Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage"" screening).

For tonight's screening of ""Time Machine 2011: Cleveland"" the biggest Rush-celebrity not in the band Donna Halper was there and took stage before the show to share stories of having been at the Cleveland concert as a VIP and of her continuing years being a friend of the band & vice verse (she's from Dorchester MA originally and seems to reside here in Boston again). Donna was well received and she noted Rush fans are loyal and friendly like no others. Donna also made special point of sharing the guys in the band are not only exceptional musicians but are the most genuine nice guys she's known and that's over a long 40+ year career in media/broadcasting having meet all sorts or rock-stars that have come & gone. Of course she was preaching to the choir tonight but hearing from multiple sources that they're great guys off stage somehow makes it that much more enjoyable seeing them do their thing so well on-stage.

Was an excellent and long show (the concert & some Rush theatrical extras I won't spoil) with us having an enthusiastic theater crowd to take it in.
Notably it's the band's first live concert filmed in the United States and along with other very new and old tracks they performed Moving Pictures album live in its entirety (but possibly not in origial order).

I intend to preorder the Blu-ray edition to add to my Rush vid collection.

The band has not lost a step since my first show, if anything they are better. My son is in the music business and has a love for music that is second to none. He was blown away, just like his dad.

They weren't, they just knew good freaking music!!  Missed the Moving Pictures tour...but caught Signals and have been hooked ever since.

4656241,2,B005D0RDKW,"Just played the blu-ray version on master audio via my oppo, wow what a step backwards from the much more dynamic Snakes & Arrow blu-ray. Not shure what happed as most of the same people who did S&A did this recording, except that Alex was Not involved in the mix of Time Machine. The recording lacks dynamics, air, and the detail.  If S&A was the 2nd row vantage point sonically, Time Machine is row 57. Neil makes sounds w/o impact or dynamics, his set sounds glazed over, processed & compresed & distant.  However Alex guitiars sounds good and retains dynmaics & edge.

Cant recommend given the much better sounding S&A  made just a few yr ago, it also has better non moving picture song selection than time machine.

What happeded from a audio production standpoint?. Does anyone know? . video ,who cares rush was never a visual band & I would trade off a bad video production for better sound quality any day.

Rush time machine tour was highlighted by playing the entire Moving pictures record, which was the main draw for many of  the die hard fans who finally had a chance hear the camera eye & vital signs, which are some of rush's best songs but rarely played since 1982 live.

Unfortunately inorder to get to the best part of the show fans had to endure awful songs like bu2b & faithless, leave that thing alone, stick it out & other questionable selections. At the same time no songs were played from P/G and one song from power windows.

However the torture will not need to be repeated on the blu-ray as fans can now FF over the dreck to the good parts of the show, and since they just released S&A blu-ray a few ys ago one can combine the two into one real best of show.",1318291200,5,1685,4.409677419354839

They can really pump out the music, even with just 3 people. They never use backing tracks either, they just trigger sound bits when they need to use background choirs or anything. Even the songs I don't like such as Leave that Thing Alone sounded so amazing and full of energy! I cant wait for this so I can re-live that experience again!",1318118400,3,486,4.293478260869565
4656243,5,B005D0RDKW,"I became a Rush fan at age 15 after hearing ""The Spirit of Radio,"" ""Freewill"" and ""Jacob's Ladder.""  Searching back through the archives, I fell in love with this band with Hemispheres and A Farewell To Kings.  Digging further, I found a true sense of song with Caress of Steel via ""Lakeside Park,"" ""The Necromancer"" and ""Didacts and Narpets.""  While many (including the band) regard 2112 as the passe-partout without which Farewell and Hemispheres would not have come to be, I found 2112 inspirational, whimsical and ambitious with Overture, Bangkok and Twilight Zone.

With my $8.50 general admission ticket in hand, I went to my first show in September, 1980 (the original Moving Pictures tour).  I was absolutely blown away with the sound of the band live:  note perfect as if I had dropped the needle on a pristine vinyl album.  The original ""Atari Road"" (not listed as part of the warm up tour, but was played) for Red Barchetta was scintillating, Xanadu amazing, and La Villa Strangiato for dessert.  While I do not recall The Camera Eye as part of the set, it is possible I missed it while chasing a skirt (or 4).

I did not see them again until 1983 in support of the Signals album (which many regarded as the Kilroy Was Here (Styx) for Rush).  Although awash with hard synth sounds and composition, I found the album stood firmly on its own.  Everyone knows Subdivisions, but few know Chemistry, Losing It, The Analog Kid and Digital Man; all strong pieces on their own.  Grace Under Pressure brought its own onslaught of great composition as did Power Windows (Afterimage, Kid Gloves, The Enemy Within; Marathon, Manhattan Project, Territories).

While Hold Your Fire and Presto had a greater mass appeal, the coup de grace for the effort of commercial appeal fell with Roll The Bones.  Make no mistake, all of these are great albums (Prime Mover, Mission; Anagram, Available Light; Ghost of a Chance, Bravado, Heresy), but it was good to see the guys get back to brass tacks and hard roots with Counterparts, Test For Echo and Vapor Trails.  While I was privileged to see the band twice on Snakes & Arrows, I've yet to truly GET the album (not surprizing; took me two years to get Test For Echo).

Nonetheless, I have NO DOUBT in my mind that this will be a release of Epic Proportions:  Moving Pictures Live; Front to Back.  I can't wait to see the guys back in action celebrating 30 years of one of my favorite albums.",1318032000,4,2432,4.669014084507042

Most of the time we see them in St. Louis MO.  I was very lucky that I married a Geddy Corn (Google for explanation) and she and I have raised kids that love Rush. We saw the Time Machine Tour in 2010 and it was simply awesome. Getting to see the whole Moving pictures in its entirety was great. Getting to see the camera eye performed for the first time was a great as well. This band has literally written the soundtrack for my life and I have great musical respect for them and their fans.

Every time I drive by that theater which is torn down except for the historical facade I remember how they rocked that place.

I have read some negative reviews of The Time Machine Tour by some fans who did not like the set list or some other reason. I say nay nay to the nay sayers.
This is a band that plays a three hour set and still has another thirteen hours of material they could play.  They have been together for over forty years and their body English says that they still they enjoy playing in front of fans and being together on stage. They may have changed their sound through the years but returned to the basics and have never changed their musical ethics.
The bands video presentations, smart camera angles, pyrotechnics, sound mix, lighting and musicianship made the two shows I went to memorable.

The DVD is coming out and I have pre-ordered it. Why? Because every time I hear Spirit of Radio I think of ""That piece of garbage. That's not garbage, that is a Gefilter, an invention of musical genius"" and get goose pimples.

Just got the Blue Ray, and honestly the second best concert video I have seen to date.  First is Snakes & Arrows, but musical performance on Time Machine has slight lead.  Genesis Live over Europe is 3, except they need a blue ray version of that.

Get a backup copy for emergencies!!!!!!! Ironic this performance was recorded a few blocks from the 'Rock-n-Roll Hall of fame.  News Flash, April 15, 2011, Quicken Arena was the Hall of Fame!

Since this is not out yet, can not comment on the audio or video quality.  If they match or exceed Snakes and Arrows, then it will be amazing.
