7843004,5,6303283500,"This was purchased as a replacement for an identical set I had earlier that I later sent as a gift to a family member.
A majoriity of people may not find it deserving of a 5 star rating due to the fact it lacks the luster of better more Hollywood style productions.
However for myself personally it is found to be realitively historically accurate and from that standpoint the footage it contains is more
than adequate.
The Blenham Bomber restoration documentary contained on disc #1 of the set is easily worth the cost alone I paid for the entire set of 5.
The story and video footage it contains is nothing short of spectacular. Anyone interested in military avaition history and or warbird
restoration will find something of interest in this 5 disc set for them. A good buy ! Looking for another set shortly to send to warbird friends.",1442620800,,838,4.593333333333334

7843006,1,6303283500,"You get what you pay for. The reason this set of DVDs is so cheap must be due to the mistakes made throughout. For example, there is a sequence where the narrator is describing the SBD Dauntless, arguably the most successful WWII naval dive bomber deployed by either side in the war, while continually displaying film of the SB2C Helldiver which was its (very troubled)successor. There are repeated instances where the narration describes one type of action ( a naval engagement) and illustrates with an entirely different activity (an air strike on a land base). Facts are frequently garbled. ""By the end of 1945, the war in Europe was coming to an end."" May is not the end of the year. The same footage repeats over and over at different points in the narrative. It is just regularly irritating if you have more than a rudimentary acquaintance with the actual facts.",1279929600,3,868,4.754966887417218
7843007,3,6303283500,"This video is a must for any Civil War buff of Gettysburg. It centers more around the 20th Maine than it does for MG Chamberlain though. Great research included of photos and primary sources. It also gives great resources for more research. Though it is an ancillary source, it still gives a wide breadth to the soldiers and sons of Maine!",974764800,2,339,4.573770491803279
