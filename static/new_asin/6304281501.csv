It looks worse than a student film, more like a home movie made by fourteen-year-olds. The sound is terrible, the acting is lame, and there is no plot whatsoever.",1122249600,2,306,4.116666666666666
7866406,1,6304281501,"OK this movie is one example of low budget movies.
The movie has no plan,bad camera angles,and it looks like the most student movie of all time.
The fight seen tries to do editing but its wack. WHY,cause the movie is so low-budget that they can filter the sound effect to make it look like if he break his arm or shot him.
OK,I will give this movie a break. But hey,this movie is not worth (the amount)(...)",1006905600,2,407,4.230769230769231
