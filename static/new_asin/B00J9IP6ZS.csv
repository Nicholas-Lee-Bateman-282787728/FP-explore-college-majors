8649007,4,B00J9IP6ZS,"This is the story of a boy who wants to see the world through his camera.  As he goes through school numerous girls realize how special he is through his shots.

Think of this as a dating Sim anime. The first half of the season is the story and each episode of the second half is alternate endings of which girl he ends up with. Episode 13 is a surprise girl you probably didn't see coming. Pick which ending you liked best.  A very unique anime that I thoroughly enjoyed.",1456272000,,472,4.222222222222222

8649011,4,B00J9IP6ZS,"Kazuya Maeda doesnt want to stand out.  When his dad gives him and older camera, he decides to take it to school for some photo chances- which range from scenery to mostly girls.  His new camera and new photography club membership send him on a small journey of self-exploration.  Based on the dating simulation game of the same name, it is a multiple plot line anime starting with the gift of the camera and going along each of 7 girls arcs.  Four episodes are spent on meeting the girls and finding out their personalities, and then each girl gets an episode except for Haruka who gets two.  First time viewers may find it disconcerting when the new arc starts in the next episode with a new girl without much warning.  If you like school romances this is a good show, with comic relief provided by the other members of the photography club.  Spoiler alert the last episode is a sis-con episode.",1407888000,,897,4.53416149068323
8649012,5,B00J9IP6ZS,"If you liked those anime series this could fun too, the series is about Kazuya Maeda who gets a camera and joins the Photograph Club. In his days he meets every girl who wants him to take photograph of them, like Amagami this anime is divided in archs (every girl has their own during a couple or three episodes) my favourite character is the main girl Haruka Niimi voiced by the cute Japanese voice actress Kanae Itou.",1407456000,,419,4.454545454545454
