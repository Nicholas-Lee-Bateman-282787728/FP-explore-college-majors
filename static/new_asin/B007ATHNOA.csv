5072873,2,B007ATHNOA,"I don't know how this movie come about or if it was an authorized biographical kind of thingy....but watching this was depressing.  It was basically spasmodic memories of a drug addicted pop star put on film..or so it seems.  It covers up to the heroin ordeal when he first lost his visa to the United States.  I remember that time...I was diva-stated.
The movie does give you some interesting names, a tragic love story from the beginning, and a father who loved his son.  It was boring to watch, but any fan will.
The Boy George will always be one of my big interests, and I will always love his beautiful voice.  I would have rather had a new album, rather this movie...to be honest.",1337904000,,686,4.456
5072874,3,B007ATHNOA,"Very stream-of-consciousness film which flashes back between the late 70's to when Boy George first came to London and to the summer of 1986 when his struggles with addiction came to light in the UK. As a straight up bio on him, it's extremely limited in its scope and you're far better off watching VH1's Behind The Music if you are curious about how he became the icon he is.

The majority of American fans may find this movie hard to follow, as it focuses largely on the Blitz club and the New Romantics movement, which largely went by unnoticed over here except for the occasional Adam Ant video (grrrr). Having said that, the two kids playing George and Marilyn NAIL the roles, down to the accents and mannerisms. Douglas Booth is great in the role as Boy George, even if he is a tad prettier than the real Boy himself. The costumes, music and makeup are all bang on and that's the strongest sell of this movie for me. They've done an awesome job recreating this era, even if it isn't as pretty as the kids in it pretended to be. There's lots of sex (straight and otherwise), despair, coarse language, drugs, booze, all kinds of things in this movie that make it inappropriate for anyone under 16 to watch. But again, these are all things that actually happened in peoples' lives, and George himself was barely 17 at the start of the story.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't show the good things that came with the fame, and that strikes me as unfair. There's not even a postscript to say that Culture Club went on to sell XX million records. We only see George as this sad and lonely figure throughout, not knowing that in between he was at the top of his game and like, one of the biggest rock stars around in 1984. It's all the lows and none of the highs-er, at least the career ones. It also doesn't explain how, when, or why George turned to heroin, since it's pretty clear he stayed away from the stuff before he got famous.

So as a biography of Boy George, it's deeply flawed. But as a snapshot of the Blitz kid scene in London, it's actually quite good. I think it's worth watching if you are curious about this era in music. The music snippets/advertisements in it are really good and true to the era. My favorite scene is based on the night Bowie went to the Blitz club and approached Steve Strange to be in the ""Ashes to Ashes"" video. Steve's reaction is priceless, and the way they dance around finding an actual actor that looks like Bowie was clever.

Worried About the Boy is decent time capsule of a very distinct style tribe in London and all the main players in it. If you are into the Blitz scene and New Wave in general (or are too young to remember it and are just curious), this isn't a bad place at all to start as an orientation.",1334448000,8,2759,4.3828125
5072875,3,B007ATHNOA,"As a huge fan of Boy George and Culture Club, I expected to see more of his younger days and family life.  This film focused a lot on his time at the Blitz with very little time on how he came to be with Culture Club.  Oh sure, it touches on that, but it's like most of the details are left out.  The story is more about his relationships during that time rather than the walk to fame and fortune.  It fails to show how he came about his particular style, where he learned make-up, etc.  Mostly club scenes, boy-meets-boy scenes, a couple of mix-ups with his dad and an annoying back and forth thing between the past and the ""present"".  All in all very confusing leaving more questions than answers.  I would not recommend this movie as one to see how George O'Dowd became Boy George and Culture Club.  I will say this, though, the fellow who played Boy George did an excellent job and he's very attactive...with and without make-up.",1334448000,12,933,4.383720930232558

5072887,5,B007ATHNOA,"The sad story of Boy George. He had quite a life, I must say. There is no need to go into to story because all of us who grew up in the early 80's know him for the outrageous man he is. this story goes even before that. We get to see the evolution of the man. The entire cast is magnificent but huge kudos have to go to Douglas Booth, he had this down pat. many times I thought he was Boy George!

5072909,5,B007ATHNOA,"Originally I saw the BBC made for tv movie of this DVD.  I fell in love with it.  All the feel of when I used to go out in the 80's.  The music, the club kids, the outfits, the dancing.  When this was released on DVD all but some of the original music was stripped out and replaced with generic beatbox synth music.  Gone are the songs by Bowie, Siouxsie, OMD, Kraftwerk, Human League, and Hazel O'Connor.  Don't get me wrong, I still love this movie, but it really lost a lot of the feeling of the 80's with the soundtrack stripped.  Some parts don't even make sense.  The scene where George sings a line from Theater of Hate's song and Kirk tells him he can't sing is stripped down to a scene where George suddenly sings the word, or part of the word, sexuality and Kirk says you shouldn't sing. I had hoped that maybe the UK version kept the original soundtrack, but all the reviews say it was removed as well from their version as well.

If I would have seen this version first, I would have liked it.  Having seen the UK TV version first, this release left me feeling very let down.  The 80's was about the music, the styles, the clubs, the attitudes.  If you take away the music, it doesn't feel right.",1408406400,9,1208,4.25

5072914,4,B007ATHNOA,"Superb acting by all cast members describing key parts of the early life of George O'Dowd is transformed into the hugely successful Boy George. The film is very watchable, and the acting is outstanding.
Douglas Booth, Matthew Horne and Richard Madden do a fantastic job as George, John and Kirk, but for me it was Martin Gatiss' short portrayal of the svengali McLaren that was particularly noteworthy.
Surprisingly, the soundtrack is remarkably thin, which was disappointing but the story kept me glued to the screen, especially with the occasional interjection from Jerry O'Dowd (played by Francis Magee) who seems to have been an incredibly supportive father in the grand scheme of things.
This is definitely worth watching but. as others have said, it leaves a lot of information unsaid - such as the jump from Bow Wow Wow to the new band and their somewhat meteoric rise as Culture Club.",1392508800,,892,4.953333333333333

5072933,4,B007ATHNOA,"Boy George is one of my all-time favorite singers so I'm predisposed to like anything about him. This movie focused on the yrs before his
success ... when he was living in the slums and working as a coat check attendant at the Blitz. Douglas Booth does a terrific job of portraying
Boy George's charming vulnerability and sauciness. It's not 5 star because there was too little singing and too much focus on his dysfunctional
relationships with Kirk and Jon Moss. Even so ... it should please even the most die-hard fan.",1359331200,2,520,4.663043478260869

5072946,5,B007ATHNOA,"I first saw this online when it came out a couple of years ago because it wasn't available here. I was pleased to see it released in 2012 for a USA-compatible DVD player.

I loved it. It's not perfect or as long as I wanted it to be, but I still loved it. But I also understand it wasn't created to be a complete biography of the rise and fall of Culture Club... or of Boy George. It doesn't illustrate the impact this guy had on fans, perceptions of sexuality, popular culture, or music. You won't even hear more than a couple of Culture Club songs here. I get the complaints, I really do. But those bio's have been done before. Check out VH1's Behind the Music for a full bio, for example.

This is something different. This movie is a snapshot of the love and loss that led to the creation of Culture Club and Boy George's fall into addiction. It has parallel stories that start in 1980 with another of him in the midst of addiction in 1986. And not much more. But that doesn't make it any less fascinating. These are his key connections that probably shaped the rest of his life. And they were the parts most hidden from the public.

Personally, I loved the casting. I know the lead who plays George (Douglas Booth) is shorter, slimmer, and prettier... but when George first came out he was beautiful and womanly. We didn't know what he was, yet women, men, children, grannies... we all loved him and his music. I think the beauty we saw and loved is represented in the casting. The actor who plays Jon also looks older and less sexy than Jon actually was... but he's got down the confidence, aloofness, and seductive energy that shaped George and the band.

Loved beautiful Marilyn and the peek into The Blitz Club and all the other characters- Malcolm McLaren was hilarious. This may only be a snapshot, but it's a pretty one... and a very witty and often funny one to boot. A real glimpse of the time period and the spirit that brought on so much change in music, fashion, and culture. And it's a moving revelation of what drove George at the core.

I would have preferred a bigger story, too. But I accepted this for what it was and still loved it.",1357689600,,2156,4.38

5072948,5,B007ATHNOA,"I saw the film online as it was not released in the United States.  I bought the UK dvd although I could not view it. I bought it just to own it. It has to do with the format.  I bought this version so I could view the dvd. If you like Culture Club and are a fan of Boy George, this is a great film.  Douglas Booth has moved on to other work, but he did a great job as Boy George. This would have been a great theatrical release. It would have needed more material though..",1355529600,,473,3.806122448979592
5072949,5,B007ATHNOA,"I had always liked Boy George's music but had known little about him as a person. Worried about the Boy is done so well and young Douglas Booth as Boy George is great. The movie shows the progression of a boy who is lost and gradually finds his path...although there is lots of pain along the way. I watched it 3 times and liked it better each time. I think Douglas Booth is an amazing actor...he BECAME Boy George with all the pathos, hurt, daring-ness, and outrageousness. Wonderful movie and great acting.",1351209600,2,508,4.532608695652174
5072950,3,B007ATHNOA,"It was a good movie. Didnt really dive into the other characters because it is a movie about Boy George. It did talk about his drug addiction but not how or who got him hooked, and didn't really go into a lot of detail about Culture club. All in all, it did shed a lilltle light on Boy George and his rise and fall to fame. Interesting and insightful @ times, like hopping in a time machine and reliving the 80's. And on that note, its a must see.",1350777600,,447,4.033707865168539
5072951,2,B007ATHNOA,"First of all, don't confuse this movie with much to do about Culture Club.  That aspect of George's life is barely a blip on this movie screen.  Most of the film takes place in his years after school and before Culture Club, with a splash of his late 80's addiction drama.  It's possible they could have added a bit more actual history to the story line and deleted a bit of the fluff, but showing George's early years to make it more engaging, but he was more style than substance in real life.  The acting was pretty good. The George fellow was great.

I felt as if this movie should have filled in the gap between 1983-1987 to make it feel complete.  As I said, the acting was impressive.  The filming was very good quality.  Had they added this to their timeline, I suspect it could have been sold to a larger distributor and more marketing would have been done to promote this movie -- and it would have been more of a success.  It felt like an unfinished project.

It's no fun to 2-star rate this, but having been quite a hard-core fan throughout the 80's and into the 90's I know there many other stories that could have been added to make this more interesting.  And for folks that just liked Culture Club, well... they will probably want to see a bit more of that time frame in the film.  Don't NOT see it, but don't PAY for it is my recommendation.",1344384000,,1358,4.303149606299213

5072953,5,B007ATHNOA,"This is an awesome glimpse into George's early years. The two actors who stood out the most for me were, of course, Douglas Booth in the lead role as George, a brilliant portrayal of our Boy, and Freddie Fox who, as Marilyn, was simply divine. The story goes back and forth from his early years up to 1986 where George's struggles were at their peak and he was literally at the mercy of the press. An early Amazon review paints Booth's portrayal of George as unpleasant. I don't see him that way. George is someone who, to this day, refuses to be ordinary. I love that about him. He's assertive. Be it love or career, he knows exactly what he wants and goes after it with all his might.

So if you love the Boy like I do, ring (or text) a couple of your Culture Club friends, throw in some popcorn and make it a Boy George movie night. You'll be glad you did!",1341187200,2,859,4.206060606060606
5072954,5,B007ATHNOA,"Growing up as a teenager, George O' Dowd realizes he is not like other boys his own age. He is sharp-witted, independent-minded and has a passion for clothes and make-up. The film is starting off at Essex Green Middle School when a careers officer asks George what he's better at than anything else, there's a tangible pause before George gives the obvious answer. "" Makeup"" I'm good at makeup!""

Next were taken to leaving the London suburbs in 1980 for squatting in London where George meets his best friend Marilyn. They soon all become a fixture at the infamous Blitz Club - the favorite haunt of those at the forefront of the New Romantic movement.

George is getting hot and heavy with a new conquest in a phone box, who delivers the party line `I'm not really gay', George gives us that giggle and refers to his killer outfit he's wearing: `That's all right, I'm not really a nun.'

Nightclub pioneer and Visage front-man Steve Strange offers George a job as cloakroom attendant at the Blitz. As a cloakroom attendant at the (in) famous Blitz Club (a job he gets with the best answer to the question `Why do you want this job?' George says ""I Don't"" Steve says to George ""Then Your Hired"". There he will meet Kirk the lead singer of ""Theater Of Hate"" and becomes one of George's first true love, who inspires George to write his own music. George falls madly in love with Kirk and writes the song ""I'm An Animal"" about him.

The  Relationship starts off well, George's dyes Kirk hair blonde and Kirk keeps telling George how much he looks like a girl. The two fall madly in love with each other. George and Kirk go out on a few dates were there seen walking through town holding hands, everything is perfect. George then has his 19th birthday and Kirk buys George his famous Kimono style robe.

George then goes to bands rehearsals with Kirk where he is singing a song he had written about George called 'Original Sin'. George is floored that Kirk had written a song about him. George is very pleased and Kirk shows him the 7"" single with the B-side of 'Original Sin'. George then turns around and fixes Kirk's hair and send him off to the stage. In the meantime at the rehearsals George is spotted by Jon Moss who is Kirk's friend at the time.

George is then so in love with Kirk he decides to make dinner for him by cooking him Onion rings and some wine with a flower set at the table. About 2 hours go by and there is know sign of Kirk. George then heads to a pay phone a decides to give Kirk a call, Kirk decides to breakup with George over the phone. We next see George walking 20 miles to Kirk's house where he is banging on the front door for an answer. Kirk says he's confused and didn't mean to cause him any heartbreak.

All of Georges friends are disappearing Marilyn is in Paris, Steve Strange is forming Visage and have a hit on the radio with ""Fade to Gray'. George realizes he must become famous but how.

George approaches music impresario Malcolm Mc Laren, at a hair salon who agrees to give him the chance to be part of a band called ""Bow Wow Wow"" He will be giving a stage names called  ""Lieutenant Lush"" which was a song that Malcolm had already written. Having failed to fit in with the other band members, Malcolm decides to dismiss George from Bow Wow Wow.

George is devastated and is in a coffee shop with Marlin who just got back from Paris he is approached by Mikey Craig, who sees George in the NME magazine about  an article about ""Bow Wow Wow featuring Lieutenant Lush"" Mikey instantly recognizes George and asked him if he like to be the lead singer of a band he's setting up.

George remembers Jon Moss which he leads him joining the band as drummer along with Roy Hay on guitar, the band is edging towards professionalism and Culture Club are complete.

They start recording at Mikey Craigs basement tracks ""Eyes Of Medusa"" and ""White Boy"". Later we see Mikey asking George in the basement if he really is going to be singing a song ""The Eyes Of  Medusa"" Mikey says to George ""He loves me, he hates me, he knows me to well. Mikey says to George ""Your saying he instead of she?"". George gets pissed and storms out side where we then see Jon Moss confronting him to write honest music. George quotes ""We cannot be something were not""

Jon comes knocking on Georges front door about his girlfriend breaking up and gives him a black eye, George tries to help Jon and Jon says ""My girlfriend thinks I'm falling for you. ""I am he says"" they kiss and next were seeing the two in bed.

The films final climax is when Culture Club are about the go on Top Of The Pops, everyone is nervous including Mikey Craig who is getting so nervous he may have the runs. LOL. Roy is asking Jon to please get George out of the car. Jon decides to go out side to get George to come back in. He doesn't say anything to George instead he breaths on the car window two times and places a heart shaped by his finger on to the window, he then see George in the window glass looking at the heart smudged onto the window. It melted boys heart the he decides to go on. As George prepares to make his performed there was one thing he noticed was Kirk Brandon getting ready to go on next after Culture Club, George looks at him and puts his glass eyeglass on and Kirk eyes start to tear up and the two never speak. George looks away and we then see him performing ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"".",1339977600,2,5403,4.344246031746032
5072955,5,B007ATHNOA,"I'm no Roger Ebert, but here's my review of the movie. Like so many before and after him, George was one of those teenage kids who were predicted to go nowhere in life, and hence was told that make-up wasn't a real career. Right...say that during the Oscars. After his school days, he found ""oddball"" people he fit in with and made friends with, including ""Marilyn."" His life, however, was still... stuck in neutral, you might say; and his love life kept hitting ""pot holes."" He found masculine guys, including Jon Moss, who were going through a bisexual ""faze,"" which they fought against inside themselves, but couldn't help. Naturally, they were attracted to a feminine-looking man, until they got over it and wanted to move on with heterosexual lives. This left George feeling betrayed over being used as some kind of sexual experiment. Fortunately, the personal issues between George and Jon didn't stop their ""up-and-coming"" band from appearing on ""Top Of The Pops."" Sadly, we all know about The Boy's downward spiral into drugs, which I'm sure had a lot to do with the end of Culture Club and the lost love of Jon Moss. During a very tense phone conversation in 1986, Jon claims to be alone in the middle of the night; but we don't know for sure. George has been clean for years now, and I'm sure one of the reasons is the love and support of his fans from all over the world. All of the acting is quite good, though I am particularly impressed with the lead actor (Douglas Booth) who played George. I wonder if he's gay in real life. If not, that would be even more impressive of his acting ability! The actor who played Jon Moss also gave quite a performance. George was never one to hide who he is as a gay man. In fact, he flaunted it very fashionably for all the world to see. His father must have had a difficult time accepting his son as he is, but deep down loved him unconditionally and was often ""worried"" about him - first when he was a wayward teen, and then when he struggled against drug addiction. This is most definitely a biopic that no Boy George/ Culture Club should miss, or just anyone who is ""different."" I myself am 4'7'' as a adult woman, and also Culture Club fan since '82. Perhaps this movie can help today's youth who are bullied. George MUST have been bullied as a kid, though the movie doesn't show that, which would be my only criticisim.",1338508800,2,2375,4.5

The movie did a horrible job of explaining anything about Boy George.  It was very disjointed and did not feel complete.  Do not waste the $3 or $4 to watch this.,1482624000,,279,4.0

8513583,1,B007ATHNOA,"Well-intentioned I suppose, but simply horrid.

I grew up with Culture Club & have been a fan of George through thick & thin. I'd hoped for more after reading glowing reviews but unfortunately this BBC tv movie was disappointing, contrived & poorly acted. I must give a nod to the the fellow who played Malcom McClaren...his performance...though short, was fairly spot-on. Douglas Booth (even if painfully handsome) is also a good actor but not in this production. His movements/mannerisms did not come close to George's...especially in the dancing scenes. Perhaps he wasn't given proper direction or due to time/budget everything was rushed & without nuance.

An original soundtrack might've helped a bit. Without the original artists of the time & the aggregate misses in capturing the players, the era, & the Boy himself, this movie just seems like a well-intentioned but lifeless high school video production effort.",1478563200,,920,5.2517006802721085
8513584,4,B007ATHNOA,Relived London in the 80's. Could have shown a little more about his life. Still loved it. Great 80's makeup & hair,1477526400,,115,4.2727272727272725
8513585,4,B007ATHNOA,"not a bad little ""movie"" for Boy George fans, but it definitely leaves one wanting to know More of the story... the actor portraying  George does a really good job. comparing it to his autobiographical books, it seems fairly true to facts (as told by George that is)...",1476403200,,269,4.604166666666667
8513586,4,B007ATHNOA,"Good movie.  A bit abstract at first, but the approach is different and the acting is spot on.  Brought back a lot of memories of the fashion of the 80s and I related to the youthful portrayal of fashion and music being the center of my world back then.  I miss the days I lived in London......the best city in the world (after Chicago of course....).",1475884800,,351,4.287878787878788
8513587,5,B007ATHNOA,"I am a huge fan of Boy George and Culture Club! When I found this movie on Amazon I had to get it! It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner! I also really loved the portrayal of the people in this film and the style it was edited in! It's truly an amazing film that captures the early years of Boy George and Culture Club! It did make my very traditional parents uncomfortable due to the homosexual live scenes, which aren't graphic by any means but I thought I'd include that info just in case you will be bothered by it. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to fans of Boy George and Culture Club as well as to anyone who feels like an outcast!",1475625600,,671,4.129770992366412
