7452742,5,B015WU6DQW,"PROS:

- Excellent follow-up to other DCAU shows, like Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, Justice League, and even Batman Beyond.

- Hugely expanded roster of heroes.

- Intriguing overarching story.

- A very ""adult"" show, meaning that the themes presented aren't always simple.  A great deal of depth to the writing, which I have come to expect from Timm and the DCAU staff.

- A decent send-off to the DCAU.

CONS:

- Only 39 episodes.  It deserved a lot more.

- It marks the end of the DCAU.  The end of an era, to be sure.

OTHER THOUGHTS:

Any fan of comics, other DCAU properties, the original Justice League series, or superheroes in general should own this.",1488758400,12,671,4.632478632478633

7452748,5,B015WU6DQW,"For all the 90s kids who need to know how the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" series ended --- Justice League Unlimited is the final iteration of those cartoon universes. Disc 2 contains the 8-episode long ""Cademus Arc"" which is honestly some of the best storytelling I've ever seen in an American cartoon.

Disc 1 has a bit of growing pains as the writers seem to be trying to figure out exactly what to do with all of the superheroes, but within a few episodes the writers start to hit their stride and the show becomes significantly more enjoyable. Disc 3 has a worthwhile ""Legion of Doom"" arc although not quite as good as Disc 2.

The universe is continued from ""Justice League"" (without unlimited). A few episodes here and there reference the events from the previous series. But this series is designed with the proper flashbacks to explain the relevant details. There are at least two episodes which directly reference characters and events from ""Batman Beyond""",1479254400,8,961,4.818181818181818
7452749,5,B015WU6DQW,"Forget the MCU! DC's animated lineup did connected comic book franchises like kings 2 decades ago! ((Also, don't forget the MCU... those movies have been plenty fun))
This show is just a delight. Cleverly written dialogue with a massive excellent cast and some great stories/story arcs.
It's important to note that though this show stands alone quite well, it's part of a universe that ties to 6+ other shows/movies that shared voice actors as well as writers. When the same creative minds and voices lead the material for 20+ years they can pull off some amazing feats.
For example: the climax of season 2 of JLU (2004) is a Chekov's gun that was actually loaded in an episode of Superman TAS (1997). Whereas the season 2 finale is an epilogue to Batman Beyond (1999) which is itself a continuation of Batman TAS (1992). It's no wonder this show felt so satisfying to watch.",1477267200,9,875,4.7254901960784315

7452754,5,B015WU6DQW,"One of my favorite TV shows of all time.  This does a great job of making a deep cut into DC's roster, and highlighting some of the less well-known heroes.  Especially in a time when every DC cartoon seems to be about Batman, watching episodes about Green Arrow (before his popularity on Arrow), Star Girl, S.T.R.I.P.E., Vigilante (played by Nathan Fillion), Etrigan, Booster Gold, and other heroes is a welcome change of pace.",1469404800,3,427,4.835616438356165
7452755,5,B015WU6DQW,"This series is over a decade old now, and it's become a standard-setting classic.  I can't name the number of times I've heard this show listed as the benchmark for any DC movie adaptation.  It's a perfect blend of action, character development, and comedy.  The first two seasons of The Justice League were good, but flawed.  I've watched these episodes year after year and I'm in awe of how well they work.  If I could give this show six stars, I would.",1468022400,7,455,4.5

Unfortunately, the Blu-ray came damaged (the case was shattered) and I exchanged it for another but the 2nd one was also damaged (it was cracked and a piece came loose and it doesn't click shut because of the missing piece).

7452766,5,B015WU6DQW,"Just as I remembered watching with my kids when the series was released a ""few"" years ago. I wish DC (Netflix, and everyone else) would get the titling and labeling correct and figure out what they want to call Justice League Unlimited. These three discs are Justice League Unlimited - after the original League members have added all of the other members. There are some episodes that don't feature the ""regulars"" and that is not bad at all. But I had been trying to watch on Netflix and finally purchased this when I realized that I was missing a middle season, where Netflix had started started in what they called Unlimited Season 1, but was actually Season 2.  Now that I've totally confused you, you'll really just need to get all of the Justice League series and a huge bowl of popcorn and enjoy!",1456963200,3,803,4.576388888888889

7452769,5,B015WU6DQW,huge fan of the series and wish they made more Seaon 2 is the best imo and had a lot of good stories in there.  Best episodes has got to be Batman singing the blues and of course the Question Episodes.  Theres not a big difference in the qualtiy of the bluray vs the dvds I notice so far.  I played both the dvd and bluray on the same TV and player but i don't see the difference even on a 4kuhd samsung 7100 and samsung 7500 blu ray player.  Could be my tv settings and all but nothing like if I saw dirt or a stain on supermans cape really good on the bluray but on the dvd  u barely see the stain and the mud.  Still a great deal  all 3 season in 1 set compared to the dvds it was 2 sets and the packaing was very cheap to me.  the price is not too bad either I remember paying 25$ for the dvds when they first came out on day 1..  Extra are pretty much the same as teh dvds menus are pretty basic and ez to follow.  Overall a good set to grab especially if u haven't gotten it yet or a huge fan,1454716800,,998,3.7320574162679425

7452779,4,B015WU6DQW,"Justice League Unlimited: The Complete Series is a three-disc set containing all episodes of the animated series that ran from 2004 to 2006. The Justice League has saved mankind many times from terrible dangers, but the cost has been great. Their ranks have diminished after fighting off an alien invasion. With new dangers arising faster than ever, the remaining crime fighters realize that protecting the entire world is going to take more technology and more manpower.

The original seven  Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Jonn Jonzz, Green Lantern, and Hawkgirl  are now joined by a large selection of allies, including Green Arrow, Supergirl, and Black Canary. Meanwhile, after years of foiled plots and repeated beatings, the galaxys worst villains finally have a plan: strength in numbers. Led by Lex Luthor, the Legion of Doom prepares to dominate the universe.  Its first order of business: destroy the Justice League.

Many of the best comic book stories made it to this series, and it did not steer clear of adult themes, such as booting Huntress from the League for attempting to kill a man. Hawkgirl is back after betraying her teammates in the previous series, and has to deal with the repercussions from her actions. The tone of the stories varies from action-packed to romantic to lighthearted.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include Creators Commentary on This Little Piggy and The Return; a look at the revamping of the series with new characters and a new creative direction; Cadmus Exposed, a feature with Mark Hamill and creative personnel discussing the series story arc; and series writers, producers, and directors discussing their favorite moments from final-season episodes.",1449014400,23,1716,5.221818181818182

8734779,5,B015WU6DQW,"I recently bought my first Blu-ray player, and what better way to inaugurate it that than by getting something in HD that I was going to replace anyway? I love all the DCAU series even more than the original comics (anything is better than those godawful live action movies), and, as far as I'm concerned, this is the definitive version of the Justice League.

Set a few years after the previous season ends, the Justice League (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Martian Manhunter, and later, Hawkgirl) have moved in to a new headquarters and substantially expanded their roster, now including just about every B-andC-list hero in the DCU. (A few of them even get story arcs of their own.) Besides the usual array of supervillians, gods, monsters, and natural disasters to deal with, the League must now face Project Cadmus; an Illuminati-like shadow cabinet of mad scientists, sorcerers, and crooked government agents hellbent on starting a war between  superhumans and the government.

I bloody love this series! Some episodes are hilarious, others are tragic or downright scary, others leave unresolved questions that may never be answered and will certainly wrack your brain long after the credits have rolled. I can only give a resounding roar of applause for this series, it's writers, and animators. (Actually, I think animation looks better in HD than live action does!)",1534636800,,1402,5.11353711790393
