5013573,5,B006QS9OCK,"Stuck Between Stations is the story of Casper (Sam Rosen), a soldier on mourning-leave who has come back home to bury his estranged hippie-father. Whilst drowning his sorrows, he bumps into old classmate Rebecca (Zoe Lister Jones) and the two begin to connect on this single evening touring the Minneapolis underworld. As chance takes them from place-to-place they realise they have an inordinate amount in common and tangible chemistry, but with Casper's imminent return to the front-lines looming what will this encounter ultimately amount to?

Brilliantly shot by first timer Brady Kiernan, this low-budget romp around night-time Minneapolis shows a chaotic party-filled night as Casper bumps into old friends, the anarchist bike-gang leader Paddy (Josh Hartnett -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucky-Number-Slevin/dp/B0026Y88RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucky Number Slevin</a>) among them. Rosen & Lister Jones carry the entirety of this film however, any other characters are merely bit-parters revealing something about the protagonist's past. Resultantly by the end of the 85 minute duration I felt that I knew both Casper & Rebecca like friends and genuinely wanted them to get together, their chemistry is palpable. Rosen plays the lovable but ultimately directionless soldier well, whilst Lister Jones provides a beautifully-fractured character.

Extra Content: A commentary with the filmmakers that includes Director Brady Kiernan, Co-Writer Nat Bennett, Co-Writer and Actor Sam Rosen, Editor Sam Heyn and Producers Todd Cobery and Spencer Kiernan, and a ""Minnesota Originals: Behind-the scenes of Stuck Between Stations"" featurette.

All in all, this is an romantic Indie film that feels ridiculously real. Definitely worthy of your time.",1331856000,6,1797,6.094861660079052
5013574,5,B006QS9OCK,"First, I commend those who were involved in making and acting in this movie for not coming to this Amazon site and writing their own glowing ""reviews"" of their own movie (as so often happens with independent movies). The fact that they waited for objective viewers to write the reviews shows a lot of integrity.
I found this to be an incredibly (as I said in the title) ""realistic, honest and riveting"" movie. I really wasn't expecting much at all when I started watching it. I figured just another ho-hum independent movie. It was much more.
The main actor and actress, Sam Rosen and Zoe Lister-Jones, were absolutely phenomenal. They WERE their characters. I never felt as though they were acting. In addition, the scenes and the shots were incredibly realistic. For these reasons, during the whole movie, I felt as though I was actually in the movie - with the characters. I was participating in their adventure. I virtually never experience that when watching a film, and it was a very refreshing experience.
The movie also made intriguing use of split screen - not often, but just enough to make it appropriate.
I think the young director, Brady Kiernan, has a bright future ahead of him if he can stay true to the integrity and creativity that he brought to this movie.
In sum, DEFINITELY worth watching if you are a fan of unique, independent movies.",1331596800,6,1357,4.729957805907173
5013575,3,B006QS9OCK,"""I got to go tomorrow, or today, but I just keep thinking what if this is all we got, what if this is it?""  Casper (Rosen) is a soldier home for a few days when he meets high school classmate Becky (Jones) at a bar. After getting in a fight Casper and Becky begin talking and wind up walking and talking for the rest of the night, revealing deep secrets to each other throughout the night.  This review may sound confusing. I was trying very hard to like this movie for some reason. To me this movie alternated from really good to really boring over and over. The movie is pretty much just the two walking and talking for an hour and a half but it is still a decent movie that if you are in the mood for is worth a watch. The ending is very good and is worth making it all the way through for that. Overall, a movie with real high and lows that is worth watching. When you are in the mood for it. I give it a B.",1331510400,2,911,3.9456521739130435
5013576,5,B006QS9OCK,"I am working my way through Josh Hartnett films after finding out how serious this guy is about acting. His part is minor, but he is pitch perfect as is the film.  Another reviewer mentioned that the actors become their parts and I agree.

Hartnett can choose a script. Bravo for him resisting being turned into a commodity without a soul. I'll watch anything he is in from now on.

This film is a wonderful slice of what it means to be young today.",1404172800,,449,4.321428571428571
5013577,4,B006QS9OCK,"This is not a new idea in movies. Two people connect in the early evening and their mini odyssey runs on through to dawn and the two find out things about each other and themselves in the interim.

Here's the scoop. It's Casper's (Sam Rosen) last night in town before he heads back to the base and back to Afghanistan. He runs into Rebecca (Zoe Lister Jones) at a bar. They remember each other from grade school and proceed to strike up a conversation which leads to this that and the other thing. As dawn approaches the two have come to some conclusions about themselves and each other.

I liked this movie because I liked the two main characters. They have good hearts but they're flawed. He has some father issues and feels a bit guilty because the war hasn't screwed him up as it has many of those he served with. She's bright and on her way to a masters degree (PHD?) but pulled a big boner that might derail that. He's had a thing for her since grades school. She remembers him but doesn't share the same ""thing"" he has for her. hey have a string of good conversations as their inner selves come to the surface.

There is some nice use of split screen. It's more subtle than I've seen in other movies. I also liked the music score. It has a dreamy, ethereal quality to it. I probably couldn't listen to it by itself but it works well here. It was shot well. Not at all flashy but of a level as to eliminate the sense I was watching actors on a set. Josh Hartnett and Michael Imperioli hold their own in small roles.

The conversations between Casper and Rebecca might be a bit too clever and ""now."" It will be interesting to see how well this views ten years from now, but I liked it. They were both insightful. But the performances of both were good.

This is Brady Kiernan's first outing as director. I hope to see him at the helm again. He's done a nice job here. If good indy films are your poison, you could do much worse. Have at it.",1404086400,,1945,4.260162601626016
5013578,2,B006QS9OCK,"I would not recommend this film.  The main female character was not likable, and the plot was not memorable except for a side issue about how the main character's father felt about the main character being in the military.  The father was apparently against his son entering the military, the son joins anyway, and then when the father dies and the son comes home on leave to deal with the father's death he finds the father's car covered with supportive military bumper stickers.  And for some reason this confuses the son and he doesn't know what that means.  Really?  For the confused scriptwriter, let me explain that it means that the father loved his son, the father was supportive of his son's decisions even if they were contrary to the father's original advice, and that the father learned from his son and came to believe that his son was engaged in an honorable activity.  Parents can and do learn from their children sometimes and parents can and do even change their opinions based on what they have learned from their children.  Other than this unfortunate dig at the military, I don't remember much about the film.",1403395200,,1129,4.729591836734694
5013579,5,B006QS9OCK,thoroughly enjoyed! recommend it. very moving. well directed and realistically put together. wish there was a sequel  movie about it.,1402704000,,133,5.65
5013580,3,B006QS9OCK,I really enjoyed this movie. But why is the face of the actor on the right on the cover of this movie? He only has a brief appearance.,1397260800,,134,3.8214285714285716
5013581,1,B006QS9OCK,The sweet love story of how two people run into each other at a bar begins with their one night journey. It was definitely a long and dragged out story.  I would watch it if you have time to kill. And Josh Hartnett shows up for about 5 min in the movie. He was the main reason why I started to watch this movie,1396569600,,310,3.84375
5013582,2,B006QS9OCK,the acting didn't seem great and the storyline inspiring so i stopped watching.  since i didn't watch it all the way through i cant give comprehensive feedback.  maybe it was redeemed by the end.....but i doubt it.,1396396800,,214,4.756756756756757
5013583,4,B006QS9OCK,"interesting (but offbeat) story, kept my interest...lots of good lessons here and good acting in general. subtle, bittersweet...worth your time.",1395014400,,144,6.25
5013584,4,B006QS9OCK,"It's bare-bones kind of cinema. Not too many actors or action scences but each scene is deliberate and builds up nicely, so that by the end, we are ready to accept the characters for who they are and how they've grown.",1394755200,,218,4.341463414634147
5013585,5,B006QS9OCK,"Romantic suspense through the entire movie as you think this couple is going to reconnect; however they reconnected on a much higher level and at the same time rid their minds of thoughts and ideas that had been holding them back.  Interesting, suspenseful romantic movie.......a  fun one to watch.",1394755200,,298,5.061224489795919
5013586,2,B006QS9OCK,"I purchased this movie because it was filmed in Minneapolis. I am from Minnesota and was hoping to associate with the setting. Of all the gorgeous settings that could of been used the warehouse district was the main setting which didn't portray the city very well. I was also a little disappointed with the amount of swearing with in the movie. It is an independent produced film , which might explain why  I didn't see any rating before hand on the movie. The premise and structure of the movie is another quality that attracted me to this movie. It sounded intriguing to learn about a soldier on leave for a day who meets up with elementary crush. However, I fought myself not to fast forward through the movie. The movie seemed slow moving and not a whole lot of excitement.",1394582400,,777,4.55
5013587,5,B006QS9OCK,Didn't want it to end.  I wish they'd create an hour drama with these characters...I'd love to watch a lot more of them!!!  Sam Rosen and Zoie Lister-Jones are fantastic!!!,1394323200,,172,4.7
5013588,4,B006QS9OCK,Was looking for a feel good ending movie and found it in this won.  Very unexpected enjoyable movie. Makes you think,1393372800,,116,4.523809523809524
5013589,5,B006QS9OCK,"I love this movie.  You see the strong attraction between the two.  I love Zoe I also loved her in ""Lola Versus"". This is my first time seeing Sam Rosen and I fell in love with his character.",1390867200,,191,4.0
5013590,4,B006QS9OCK,I'm a huge Josh Harnett fan so I bought this movie because he's in it.  He plays a fairly small role but I enjoyed the movie overall.  It was relaxing and real-life.,1380067200,,165,4.125
5013591,5,B006QS9OCK,such a good story of a night a guy and a girl hanging out. wish I could do this but am too scared,1377475200,,97,3.260869565217391
5013592,5,B006QS9OCK,"I wonder why this film's rating is not higher on websites like IMDB.  Skewed expectations on the part of the audience, perhaps?  Stuck Between Stations is not an instant classic, but it's far better than most of the uninspired cinema I have seen in theaters in recent years.

Expect neither an action movie with fancy special effects nor a sugar-coated love story.  Simple, honest, and raw, Sam Rosen and Zoe Lister-Jones portray Casper and Rebecca with intimately believable performances.  After having lost all touch since high school, together they traverse the hitherto unknown nightlife of Minneapolis (unknown by me, anyway).  While the characters do engage in various activities around the city, make no mistake:  the narrative is *driven by dialogue* between two characters who are preoccupied by the events dictating their current state of affairs.  They are both confused about how to define themselves in the context of their decisions, experiences, histories, and future plans.  Casper and Rebecca do not spare feelings as they challenge one another to face setbacks with strength, honesty, and understanding.  The on-screen chemistry is fantastic.

As the aptly named movie suggests, life has a way of freezing us in chaos and instability.  Sometimes structure and hope come from unexpected sources.  This film is a highly relatable exploration of the way in which humans learn, grow, and adapt as they form meaning from the entropy of the world.",1372723200,,1459,5.237068965517241
5013593,5,B006QS9OCK,"I was so absorbed in watching and almost experiencing the relationship develop in this movie, and was almost heartbroken for it to end.  The dialogue was true and the acting spot on, it didn't feel like they were acting.  I never watch a movie twice, but I was back the next day to watch it again.  Great job!!",1346889600,,310,4.310344827586207
5013594,4,B006QS9OCK,"Thanks to the nighttime setting and the incredible chemistry between Sam Rosen and Zoe Lister-Jones, this film is comparable Richard Linklater's magical ""Before Sunrise."" If you're a fan of that film, you should definitely make the time to watch ""Stuck Between Stations,"" one of the most underrated films of 2011.",1339113600,,313,5.28
5013595,5,B006QS9OCK,"I just finished watching this and have to say, I loved this movie! The two lead actors did an outstanding job; the chemistry between them is fantastic and truly believable. By the end I was really hoping they would forget all the complications and just decide to be together. The resolution is bittersweet, hopeful, and all around beautiful.

The best way I can describe this movie would be a slightly more action-packed version of Before Sunrise set in Minneapolis. Speaking of Minneapolis, if you're from here or know it well you'll enjoy the locations used throughout...they did a really good job of establishing a sense of place, using neighborhoods throughout the city.

It's rare that I take the time to leave a review for a movie but I liked it that much. I'm looking forward to seeing what the director does next. If you enjoy stories about relationships and people connecting organically through dialog then definitely give this one a try.",1335484800,,948,4.881987577639752

8503187,5,B006QS9OCK,Awesome!,1445990400,,8,8.0
8503188,1,B006QS9OCK,This movie was slow and boring. No action and very little story line. Josh Hartnett had only a small part and it amazed me that he was even mentioned in the billing. I think the reason he was mentioned was an attempt to get viewers since the 2 main characters are unknown.,1417305600,,272,4.25

8503193,1,B006QS9OCK,"Couldn't get through the first 15 minutes.  I don't think it's because i am older and the characters are younger, but because it seems like a weak piece of work on eery level, cinematography, acting and writing.  Admittedly, it could have turned a corner later, but if there is such a thing as wisdom that comes with age, it is in knowing when to walk away.",1408579200,,357,4.393939393939394
