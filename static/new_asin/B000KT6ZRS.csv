8159062,5,B000KT6ZRS,"I watched this in the UK in the early 80's, it was on late one night so I taped the film. It was called ""A man can't have everything"" in the UK, I initially wanted to watch it as a hormonal teenager as it mentioned  a man who wanted to loose his virginity and a woman who would ""help him"".
Along with Summer of 42 this film has made a lasting impression on me, the music which I managed to record of the TV with an old fashioned tape recorder I still play to this day.
Although it was not what I expected it to be I thought the film was amazing the character played by Richard Thomas in his John Boy Walton days, and by Mary Laine are impeccable, the music haunting and sublime
If you get the chance to watch it please do you will not be disappointed.
I lent the video out and never got it back, so I continue to wait for its release (I've been waiting a along time)
If anybody reading this has a copy or knows somebody who has a copy then please let me know",1477872000,,958,3.9637305699481864
