8709400,4,B00V6C26BC,Joss is a creative thinker and fine writer. If you are reading this you likely already know who he is. I enjoyed his lecture/talk about writing.,1353110400,,144,4.576923076923077
8709401,4,B00V6C26BC,"If you're a Joss Whedon fan, you'll love this. Its a light hearted interview with some interesting insights about Joss and his writing. Get into his head and find out what the creator of Buffy and Firefly/Serenity really like and what he thinks about when creating his wonderful characters.",1223424000,,290,4.938775510204081
8709402,4,B00V6C26BC,"The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because of the quality of the DVD.  Joss is hilarious, as always, and Nathan's introduction is priceless.  (Although the guy interviewing Joss was kind of annoying.) But the video, sound, and lighting of the recording was subpar at best, and really doesn't transfer to DVD well. This is a great view for the uber-Joss fan or the amature film student.",1201737600,2,395,4.7101449275362315

They could of done a better job with the menu too. Could of had alittle more with Joss or the cast of the shows. But if you like Joss Whedon like I do, then buy this dvd. My favoite part was when he talks about how the movies writers get treating more badly then TV once, wicth if you saw the x-men inturveiw whim Summer Glau then you know that is tru.",1146787200,4,504,3.950980392156863
