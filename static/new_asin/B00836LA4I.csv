Film = barely three (3) stars; cinematography and lighting = three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = barely three (3) stars; music = two (2) stars; subtitles = one (1) star.  Director Keisuke Kinoshita's small-scale shomin-geki (home drama) production about an impoverished, but reproductively prolific (five off-springs and counting--ranging from a twenty something daughter to an infant) fishmonger who blames his bad fortunes on everything but himself.  (Fortunately he soon dies before adding any more unhappiness to the population.)  This is a tale of desperate dreamers each of whom have the same objective:  escaping a back-alley smelly (and not particularly clean) run-down family fish business.  The fishmonger wants to retire (and sponge off his rich relatives?); the wife seems to just want to die (after getting the baby literally off her back); the eldest daughter wants to have good times (in other parts of town) simultaneously financed by legal and extra-legal lovers; the teenage son wants to join the Navy; the two preteen daughters just want to take lots of day trips (one eventually makes it out by being ""adopted"" by a relative); and the baby?  S/he may be the exception here by simply wanting not to fall off her/his mother's back (the kid is just tied on with two strips of cloth!).  Some (more or less) realize their dreams (including viewers who are able to find the movie-changing button on their remotes in the dark!).  The Director loads his film with actresses and actors.  Unfortunately, none of the players are directed so as to enable the viewer to end up caring much about their predicaments.  A major disconnect.  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is not particularly notable except for the panning and tracking shots that open the film.  Lighting is a bit on the dark side (perhaps to enhance the feeling of depression?).  Music suffers from a lack of creative orchestration and musicians who are not violin players.  It seems to be stuck in a sentimental loop (to enhance the dreariness of the photo play?).  Subtitles are a major problem.  They are needed to help with the Kansai-ben dialect.  But require serious editing by a Kansai-ben grammarian, since they are way,way too long, and flash by at ludicrous speeds.  Only one sign is translated.  Restoration/preservation suffers from continuous age-related audio artifacts.  A Shochiku programmer and poster child for birth control!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1515196800,,2606,5.25181598062954
