8212812,5,B000UBN65U,"Best compilation of 2006 WRC season. Totally happy with the purchase. Although it could have 3 hours of summary, 01 hour will be enough to catch all the good (and bad) moments of the season.",1199664000,2,190,4.457142857142857
8212813,3,B000UBN65U,"Finally WRC is  offering something to North American viewers.
I just finished watching this DVD. Well produced. Before watching the season review I watched the aforementioned ""What is WRC"". This 4-5 minute  bonus video was very cool. Most awesome recent WRC rally footage set to a rockin' track. As a rally fan that has travelled to Italy and witnessed the 2002 WRC circus first hand, however, recently deprived of any TV coverage, I was almost starting to believe this was alone half worth the price of the DVD. Then I watched the season review. About 14 rallies around the world were compressed into only one hour. This reduced the review to a statistical review showing highlights, crashes, and brief driver comment. If you walk away to your kitchen for a drink you'll miss a lot of the rally.
I reduced my review to three stars because there was no in car footage letting you ride along the stages and take in the crazy driving skills, no tech analysis, no scene-setting intro to the rally locations, No weekend reviews set to pulsing music. The ""What is WRC""  bonus does offer that but it reperesents recent rally years -not specifically 2007. My old VHS rally tapes are better in this regard.
 For the price it's not bad, but then it isn't a proper season review  either. You get what you pay for. It's probably OK for non-rally fans
However it seems the WRC ""franchise"", has edited a better set of DVDs that are coming out for the 2007 season. Only three rallies to each DVD which run longer , too. It'll cost, though.
I was a little disapointed with the compressed and edited-to-nothing 2006 review, but I will probably buy the 2007 DVD series.",1198627200,4,1652,4.6438356164383565
8212814,5,B000UBN65U,"For WRC-deprived Americans, this DVD is about all of the television coverage you're gonna get of the 2006 FIA World Rally Championship Season. This is a terrible shame because, as this video clearly shows, 2006 was a very memorable championship.

Rally racing is a very exciting and entertaining form of motor sport; the world's most skilled and brave drivers careen their cars through snow, across ice, over jumps, through water, up narrow winding mountain roads, down dusty dirt trails, across asphalt streets, etc. with jaw-dropping speed and agility. The cars are juiced version of the hatchbacks and small sedans you see on the streets every day.

As usual, the team that produces WRC's TV coverage has done a fine job. The pictures are breathtaking--especially the helicopter shots.

But my three-year-old's favorite part of the DVD is the bonus feature video, ""What is WRC?"" It's a fantastic montage of songs and rally footage. We love watching that video.

But does anyone know the name and or/artist of those songs? I'm dying to know!",1197590400,3,1043,5.046511627906977
