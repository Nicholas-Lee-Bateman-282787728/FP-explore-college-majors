8507901,2,B0070Z683G,"Picked this DVD up at the Monster Jam Show in Worcester MA this weekend, got it home to find out it's only 71 minutes long across 2 DVD's, while the content was fantastic, seriously, 30 beans for just over an hour? you'd figure the way they are hyping the 30 year anniversary, there would be more content, more video of the Grave Digger trucks Racing, more something.  the main documentary felt more like a bonus feature for another DVD, with a quick glossing over of the Legend and Red Mud Gravedigger moving onto the spooky paint job.  Showing how the Paint job for the 30th anniversary truck was done was pretty awesome, but on the whole, the DVD Felt lacking.

My advice, Skip for now, until the price drops, this DVD should have been in the $15 dollar range, short with very little content to keep my son occupied.",1329696000,17,819,4.483221476510067
