1083035,4,6305714886,"I have to argue with many of the other reviews that say this movie is inplausible.  I have seen both Midngiht Express and Return to Paradise.  I loved Return to Paradise, but thought ME was long and dragged out.  Many of  the other reviewers here are ranting and raving about how drug dealers do  not turn in their own mules.. Yes, they do.  I loved the movie Brokedown  Palace- the only thing I thought was a little corny was the fact their  lawyer in Thailand was an American.",952819200,3,478,4.3522727272727275
1083036,5,6305714886,"I was blown away by this movie. Claire danes is absolutely mesmerizing from start to finish. The quality of the dolby5.1 soundtrack is awesome as is the 2.35:1 widescreen picture itself. If you own a dvd player, add this  to your library/ Emotional,intense and simply great. Dont miss it.",952646400,2,288,4.877551020408164
1083037,4,6305714886,"To be reviewing this movie with utmost honesty I would have to say that I was slightly disappointed.  The theatrical trailer factor built up a barrage of intriguing mind hooks, yet the actual score wasn't up to the  expectation.  I my self was counting days, waiting for this movie to be  released on DVD.  The weak point of this movie is actually in it's theme,  the fact that people will not be positively certain at the end of the movie  whether Alice (Danes) did commit what she confessed of doing or didn't.  I  guess that telling more will be giving the movie out.  However, the acting  performance was exceptional, and in my humble opinion, I think Claire Danes  deserves, the least, an academy award nomination for best actress.",951696000,3,736,4.6640625
1083038,5,6305714886,"Critics say this story has already been told, so compare it to Midnight Express: * Billy Hayes was guilty of smuggling; those in Brokedown Palace are innocent victims of a conspiracy to imprison them for decades or life.  The heartbreaking unfairness adds richness to the story. * Midnight Express  judged Turkey; Brokedown Palace is culturally sensitive to Thailand, and to  what constitutes justice across cultures. Midnight Express felt  America-centric; Brokedown Palace's theme of the importance of human  character highlights a Thai value.* Billy Hayes spends the film doing time;  Alice Marano demonstrates a character of iron in the face of almost  impossible adversity, while those surrounding her, of greater privilege,  demonstrate weak character.*Summary:* Yes, Brokedown Palace is depressing.  So are Philadelphia, the Killing Fields, Saving Private Ryan, others.  It's  a tragedy that needs to be told, and heard - a sensitive, powerfully moving  story of sacrifice, growth & strength.",951177600,6,999,5.630872483221476
1083039,4,6305714886,"I admit the movie does remind me a bit of ""Return to Paradise"", but I did like it and look forward to owning it.  Claire Danes was wonderful, like always, and I thought Kate did a good job, too.  Good  movie, great acting!",951177600,4,222,4.116279069767442
1083040,3,6305714886,"The acting in this movie was first rate but the story and all the plot holes were too much for me.  You'd be better off seeing Return to Paradise.  If you have seen it, don't bother watching this, you'll see nothing new.",951091200,,220,4.214285714285714
1083041,2,6305714886,"This film was supposed to be titled ""Two Girls"" They changed it.  I can think of several titles more appropriate then ""Brokedown Palace.""  ""Thailand 90210,"" how about ""The real  World....Bangkock."" God I feel silly.  I was actually afraid of this  film.  I had horrible images in my mind of poor Claire Danes and poor Kate  Beckenshaw (whoever the hell she is), being tossed into some ""Midnight  Express"" style hell hole, I hate movies like that, but not Claire  Danes, oh please not that!  I needn't have worried. It turns out that  foreign prisons are not so much jails as crowded dorm rooms in junior  college, this move could have taken place in any Catholic boarding school.  I wanted to love it or hate it but, like many, many critics, just couldn't  muster much concern one way or another.  Sure the film is rife with silly  errors Example: there is no mention of passports, these girls just fly off  to Thailand either without them (they would not have gotten plain tickets)  or they paid an exorbitant price for them (negating any money saving that  would have enticed them to go in the first place).  Certain jobs in  Thailand are not held by foreigners, it is not allowed.  One of those jobs  is in the legal field, unless you are Bill Pullman, I guess there is a  special exception for him, anyway. These errors are not so glaring as the  whole concept of two wild party girls, the film opens with them drinking in  a graveyard with there friends, rushing halfway around the world to pray at  a temple, oh those crazy girls, ""It's graduation.....lets go to the  Buddhist temple as start praying'"" Who could blame them. Then there is  the whole smuggling thing.  Do you believe that smugglers deliberately turn  in there own ""mules"" so others can get by, do you think that the  Thai airport authorities would not see that 8 girls heading to Hong Kong  had the tickets purchased on the same stolen credit card?  There is much to  swallow hear, and precious little reason to.  The big emotional scene in  the film is when Darlene accused Alice of sleeping with Nick, I am not  kidding, this is where she really cuts loose, not when she is arrested or  is freed by Alice's whining in court.  There is an unbearable scene in the  end where Claire Danes literally throws herself on the mercy lf the Thai  court...oh the humanity!  And a plethora of silliness in the prison, after  an attempted escape, she and her girlfriend are thrown in the quite room to  pout, oh those evil Thai and there torture!  The pouty room!  Surly  Amnesty International should be notified, and who dies there makeup in  prison anyway? they do a good job.  I wish I could just say this was, balls  out, a terrible movie, but Claire is such a sweetie that I, like the prison  officials, just can't stay mad at the poor girl.  I hope, I really hope  that our prisoners are being treated as nicely as they are in this movie,  sadly that probably is not true.  I will be visiting Thailand in March and  will let anyone know how it went, will go see our prisoners there.  I will  not mention this film.  ""Lost Johnny""",950659200,4,3096,4.5218181818181815
1083042,5,6305714886,"As far as extras go for this DVD...dont bother looking for any hidden ""easter eggs"" for there aren't any, but don't let that stop you from purchasing this movie. The colors are rich, hardly any bleeding, and  the sound is superb..especially when the songs from the flawless soundtrack  can be heard in the background. The subject matter of the movie has pretty  much already been done in tinseltown (the innocent take the blame for drug  smuggling)but this one stands out among the rest. Claire Danes (as usual)  is phenomenal, definitely one of the top ranking actresses of this  generation!  If you haven't already done so you should see this movie. It's  just another one of those smaller independent films with superb acting,  great music (Sarah McLachlan's contribution ""Silence"" is SWEET!),  and a story that holds your attention that is far better than ANY of the  big budget blockbusters that Hollywood usually dishes out!",944611200,,930,5.0130718954248366

1083367,5,6305714886,"Brokedown Palace is a story that deals with two American friends imprisoned in Thailand for drug smuggling. It presents a critical view of the Thai legal system.

Two carefree Americans embark on an overseas vacation that soon becomes a nightmare. Alice is a headstrong teenager who wants to do something different to celebrate her high school graduation, so she persuades her more reserved best friend Darlene to join her on a trip to Bangkok. While enjoying sun and scenery, Alice and Darlene meet Nick Parks, a charming Australian who shows them the sights and sweet-talks Darlene into a romantic assignation, which is something of a surprise to her bolder friend Alice. Nick then suggests that they join him on a side trip to Hong Kong, but they soon discover that Nick's interest has been neither friendly nor romantic: he has hidden a large amount of heroin in their luggage and is using them as drug runners without their knowledge. When the heroin is found by customs officials, Alice and Darlene are quickly tried and sentenced to 33 years in a hideous prison known to inmates as Broke-Down Palace. Their plight comes to the attention of Yankee Hank, a renegade American attorney in Asia, but while Hank struggles with the court system to get Alice and Darlene released, they must deal with the living hell of life behind bars, and their own doubts about each other.

The main lessons of this film are the following: friendship is powerful, don't trust strangers, nice girls shouldn't drink and sleep around. The film's bleakest moments, in the jail, aren't all that bad, and in this respect Brokedown Palace has nothing on the intensity of films such as Midnight Express or even Return to Paradise. Yet Danes and Beckinsale prove they are strong actresses, and their characters' friendship is suitably complex and believable. This is a tale of self-discovery and the ultimate sacrifice for a friend. It could have been compelling but unfortunately Danes and Beckinsale struggle to bring some conviction to a story sorely in need of it.",1416873600,,2045,4.941860465116279

Unassumingly used by a suave con man who slips drugs inside their backpack, they are apprehended as mules in a diversion while boarding a plane and sentenced to a Thai prison for 33 years.

There not a moment where I didn't shed a tear or two near the end. I recommend to anyone to buy or even rent this film. It kind of made me think about my friendship with some of my friends and including my best friend that I haven't seen in years now.

It's a film about how two best friends want to spend their summer with each other one last time before college. They take a trip to somewhere different than where they were suppose to go, bumped into someone that seemed nice and soon gets into trouble by getting caught with drugs at the airport in a foreign place.

It is compelling, interesting, great acting (GREAT acting), great storytelling, and catches you up in how you would do in similar horrible circumstances.  Two young girls on an adventure in Hawaii get the chance to visit Thailand.  They decide to do it without telling their parents.  They have been best friends forever, Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale), and meet a guy in Thailand who spends money lavishly on them.  When he suggests a weekend in Hong Kong, they go along...only to be violently stopped by Thai police at the airport and tossed into jail after they find 3 kilos of heroin in the girl's backpack (planted by the young man unbeknownst to the girls).  They are given a short, disastrous trial and given 40 years in prison.  There is nothing glamorous about Thai prison.  Their one hope is Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), an American attorney who practices Thai law (one of his best performances to date).  The challenges they face attempting to gain their freedom via Hank and the challenges in prison, plus their barely contained fear of staying their forever, are perfectly balanced in a perfectly paced story.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great movie and to be warned about foreign travel.",1376870400,,1350,4.780172413793103

How would you explain yourself if you can't even speak or understand their language?  Well, that's the story with this movie.  Two girls are found with drugs in their backpack on the way to Hong Kong.  Neither girl was aware they were carrying drugs- they were set up by another person.  The girls feel confident there must be some kind of misunderstanding and plead their innocence to just about every single person they can but... nobody believes them.  It's up to a lawyer and the support of a loving father (of one of the girls) to get them out of there.  It's a really unfortunate situation to find yourself in.

The final 10 minutes are not only surprising, but *unbelievably* emotional.  I wasn't expecting... that, at all.

A couple things didn't quite add up, though.  I felt that the first time the one father visited his daughter by standing across a balcony and screaming towards her was totally awkward.  He should have been really sad that his daughter was trapped in a foreign prison for a crime she didn't commit.  That would have been a more believable reaction.  Instead, he was overly confident for no reason.  Even worse, this same father -without even knowing the story- is too quick to assume that his daughters friend is a no good troublemaker responsible for the two of them being locked up.

Perhaps the actual prison aspect wasn't developed entirely either- there should have been a few conflicts brewing involving the two girls and one of the female prisoners who obviously took exception (on a few occasions) to the girls being there.  Oh and perhaps the person who set them up should have made a reappearance in some context but... he never did.  Minor issues.

Overall, a story with a ton of emotion and a surprise ending.",1353110400,,1880,4.659574468085107

In the absence of such a performance, I don't think the ending would have worked so well.  I've seen other movies she's done, and I don't think she's ever been better.

1083523,5,6305714886,"I remember when this movie first came out.  I was dying to see it for at the time Claire Danes was just everything I thought I wanted in a woman and so I just had to see every film she accompanied.  Then, about two weeks in it was yanked from each and every theater in my area and I had to wait the long haul to video before I could see it.  I'm sure it goes without saying that the date of its release I was at my local video store swooping up a copy.  I know that the film has taken its share of hits but in all honestly `Brokedown Palace' is a very compelling, believable and emotional film.  I'm actually shocked by any and all negative comments.  The entire cast, mostly Danes, really invest all they have into their characters and the story is so heartbreakingly real I urged to recommend this film and any and everyone.

The film follows two close friends, Alice and Darlene, as they slip away to share one last rendezvous before college.  Alice has always been the wild child.  She grew up in a broken home and thus lives her life on the edge and foolishly.  Darlene on the other hand has always been more sheltered by her upstanding and strict parents and so she's much more reluctant to ditch their plans for Hawaii for a getaway to Thailand.  Alice is very persuasive and so before she knows it Darlene has lied to her parents and hopped a plane to Asia with her partner in crime.  Their accommodations are far from homey but it's an experience they'll never forget.  Soon though, that experience turns sour.  After a chance meeting with a handsome Australian the girls find themselves in possession of heroin and in the hands of the Thai court system.  I've always heard rumors of the strict and oppressive laws in the Orient, especially towards foreigners but here their customs and judgments are harshly exposed.

The girls find themselves sentenced to 33 years in prison with no way to get out despite the effort on the part of Darlene's father.  Alice enlists the help of American lawyer Hank, played by Bill Pullman, a man who comes across a little money hungry in the beginning but by the end unveils his true caring colors  The film covers the girls fight for freedom, their fight for understanding and their fight amongst themselves to stay grounded.  The girl's relationship is fleshed out extremely well and is very believable.  While Alice and Darlene are best friends they are also very different people and as the blame game starts to set in they find themselves tearing away from one another in an effort to establish innocence.

The performances are strong, but Claire Danes shines so brightly here it's ridiculous.  Her character is so unbelievable real, so raw and understandable that I break down in tears almost every time I watch this film.  The scenes where she begs her father for money or pleads on her knees for an act of kindness are so heartbreaking, so devastating.  Claire Danes has proven herself time and time again that she is one of our finest young talents.  I'm still angered at the fact that the Academy fails to recognize her despite her consistent brilliance.  They've had plenty of chances (`Little Women' being the most Oscar friendly I would assume), this performance included, yet they continue to pass her over.  Alas, at least we can sit back and relish in the very concept of her immense talent.",1186099200,3,3351,4.588235294117647
1083574,5,6305714886,"I never thought that I could be moved by a film as much as I have by 'Brokedown Palace'. Not only was I very surprised by how touching the movie was, but by the storyline in general. With hopes of a happy ending, I was so shocked by the actual outcome. The sacrifice that Claire Danes character made was beautiful and I did not see it coming. Kate Beckinsale portrayed the 'good girl' image as best as anyone would and the friendship between the two is so realistic and so strong.

I love so many films and have watched nearly everything imaginable but I can say, without a doubt that 'Brokedown Palace' for me, is a film right at the top of the list. There may be more moving movies or one's with so much more intensity but this movie has something so unique that it surpasses them. I really don't know what makes it stand out so much for me, but it had an impact on me that I really didn't expect.

Kate Beckinsale did a fantastic job but it was Claire Danes character that created my love for the film. Why the critics didn't give the movie better ratings, is beyond me. But since when did they know what's what?

Brokedown palce is about two  best friends who travel to thailand for  ""adventures"" after graduating from highschool, only to find themselves in trouble with the thai government when they are thrown in prison for drug smuggling.

Both Danes and Beckinsale deliver great performances in their roles and bill pullman compliments the movie as their attorney.

The film is short with little character background information , but their performances make you feel the conncetion they are suppose to have.

The soundtrack compliments this movie so well, with songs like ""deliver me "" by sarah brightman and ""damaged"". The location (filmed in the philippines) also enhances the viewing pleasure as it looks authentic as a alternative to Bangok.

This is really a film for women, as I do not think most men can appreciate the strong bonds women share with their best friends and the turmoil and sacrifices one will go through for or with her friend. The movie is also touching because of the realism, this story is all too familiar to the countless tourists who are still serving sentences in thai prisons for crimes they did not commit. The ending was very refreshing and I will not give it away, however, it is rare when films geared toward a specific audince ( like women, mainly young women) does not provide you with the typical ending for this audience....it is not ""happily ever after"" .",1150848000,6,1500,4.83984375
1083577,4,6305714886,"This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.

They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.

The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.

Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.

While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation. Still, the film manages to entertain, notwithstanding these shortcomings.",1148774400,3,2700,4.825053995680346

1083579,4,6305714886,"This is the type of story that scares me: where seemingly innocuous decisions propel characters toward a devastating fate.  The characters, portrayed by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, are going to be friends for life even if they slowly, eventually drift apart.  For a final trip together they decide not to go the safe, routine route of going to Hawaii, again, and want something different, perhaps a little adventurous, so they decide on Thailand.  While there they meet a charismatic, only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him; and the jealousy starts to seep in.  In the midst of this subtle, female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail. One poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain.  It's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the Hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore.  There are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation.  Claire Danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario, whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time.  She is truly a talent.  Kate Beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-American daddy's girl caught up in the chaos.  For that matter, when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent.  Bill Pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken, kind-hearted turn as their lawyer.  There are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors.

1083583,5,6305714886,"I bought this just the other day based on all the high recommendations that were being given to it, and not to mention all the reviews that cited how good the acting was. Ever since I saw Igby Goes Down I've been a pretty big fan of Claire Danes (minus the horrific T3), and I also really like Kate Beckinsale so I figured I'd try it. As the credits started to roll at the end of the film I found myself shocked at how amazing this movie was. Not only was the acting magnificent, the plot was also top notch. Who isn't afraid that someone stashed something in their bag without them knowing it when they go to the airport? Who isn't afraid of foreign prisons? Who isn't afraid of prison in general? This is where this movie shines, putting those fears on film.

We start off at Alice and Darlene's high school graduation. They decide to go to Hawaii for vacation but then hear how amazing it is in Thailand, so, at the last minute, change their minds. Everything seems fine until Alice and Darlene meet a mysterious man. He offers to fly the two out to Hong Kong so they can hang out for a while longer, and after some coaxing a reluctant Alice decides to go. But while in line at the airport they are detained for trying to smuggle drugs onto a plane. This is where the movie is put into a league of it's own. In some movies you can tell it's just acting, but in this you really feel that these two are really going through this horrid ordeal.

With supurb acting from everyone involved, and a cast of familiar faces, you can't go wrong. Even Lou Diamond Phillips, in his short time on film, does a great job. But the real kudos go to Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale. Everything they do seems so genuine, like you could see a piece of yourself or someone you know in these characters.

It had a real storyline that probably could happen to anyone really. Its a story about Alice and Darlene. Two best friends from a small town in Ohio. They had just graduated and wanted to take a last big trip somewhere before they both went off their separet ways. The beginning plan was to go to Hawaii but they were soon talked into going to Thailand (which means freedom). Once there the two girls fall for the same guy (Aussie Nick Parks) He invites the two to Hong Kong. At the airport a certain event happens (won't tell you if you haven't seen it) that gets the two sent to jail...and Nick parks?? He is nowhere to be found. The two girls must find it within themselves and each other to believe and hold strong that they will get out. With the help of a layed back lawyer will that dream come true?

1083644,5,6305714886,"Dismissed by some as lightweight because they felt the Thailand prison scenes were not brutal enough, this is actually a terrific film about the complex friendship of two girls and a sacrifice made by one to save the other. Claire Danes gives a great performance as the girl most likely to get into trouble and Kate Beckinsale shines as the good girl who sees more in her friend than her parents do, especially her father.

After graduating high school they cook up a scheme to visit exotic Thailand on the cheap and do something special, telling Beckinsale's parents they are off to Hawaii. They meet Aussie Daniel Lapaine and he charms both girls into going to Hong Kong with them to continue their adventure. Jealousy plays a part as it is unclear at first which one he likes the best. But all is not as it seems and he disappears just as heroin is found by customs in their backpack.

What follows as they are imprisoned in Thailand with seemingly no way out as each begins to question their friendship and wonder if maybe, just maybe, the other one knew about the heroin, is compelling. Beckinsale's father comes to Thailand and, of course, blames Danes for getting his daughter into this mess. Danes does a good job at conveying the hurt she is trying not to show for the faith no one has ever shown in her, except for her friend Beckinsale.

Bill Pullman gives a solid performance as a slightly opportunistic and sleazy lawyer in Thailand who may be able to help them get out for a price. Adding to the atmosphere is a soundtrack just as exotic as the locale. Everything from Delerium's ""Silence"" and a remake of ""Rock the Casbah"" to the beautiful voice of  Sarah Brightman on ""Deliverance"" set a unique mood for a good film.

This is an entertaining and thought provoking meditation on friendship and loyalty. A sacrifice by one to save the other is one you'll never forget. Beckinsale, and especially Danes, really sparkle in an unusual film you won't want to miss. Pick this one up. It's a nice surprise.",1120348800,38,2014,4.614525139664805

One thing that is clear to me is that looking more deeply into the film's subtext would probably change a lot of minds.

True, some of the auxiliary characters are cliche' and underdeveloped.  But in fairness, that's why they are ""auxiliary.""

True, not all of the sets and camera work were Academy Award character.  But once again, in fairness, the imagery of the film and the beautiful use of light and color makes some of those faults less apparent.

True, it is a horrible story about what ""happened"" to them.  Yet once again echoing other reviewers, this story is not really about the horror of the prison experience in and of itself.

What holds this movie together is the acting of Danes and the complexity of her character.  What did happen between her and Nick Barnes?  We never really know.  What we see is a conflicted person who wants desperately to be believed while everyone, including her own father, sees her as the ""trouble-maker"" and assumes her guilt.

The relationship she develops with Bill Pullman's character brings out this complexity.  He is the only one to shower the kindness of presumed innocence on her, and perhaps that is what prompts her to take the fall for her friend.

The question is, do you really think she was taking the fall or did she know more than she says?  Or was it Darlene playing the innocent victim?  We are left to wonder and to replay the scenes of them on their way to the airport attempting to figure out who, if anybody, really was innocent in all of this.

Those who like interesting character studies will enjoy this performance.  A great soundtrack and a pretty good movie make this sufficient eye-candy for the rest of us.  I recommend it!",1107216000,23,1867,4.620060790273556

The auxilary characters seem to be cookie cutter representations of foreigners, and even the talented Bill Pullman is given little to work with.

Tight, squared off shots gave the entire film a TV movie feel, and neglecting to use even stock shots of Thailand (this was filmed in the Philipines) never really take you away--this could just as easily been a story taking place in the US.

The trite wrap up of the story, based on loyalty and friendship doesn't really work, because Danes and Beckinsale never quite seem to be more than coworkers before the movie moves to Thailand.",1103414400,3,724,4.73015873015873

Something that, if it were to incorporate those elements, would completely change the character of the film--turning it from a story about friendship, character, and life's little events to one about the horrors of the foreign prison.
This film is not about prison or about life in prison.  It is not about drug smuggling.  Criticizing it on this is like saying that Pirates of the Caribbean is a horrible movie because it doesn't represent an accurate portrayal of shipboard life.
It is a stunningly beautiful and well done (at points artistic) portrayal of the depths of friendship and the strength of human character (""if you are lying..."").  The sets and acting are wonderful, the examination of the Thai legal system seemed fair (regardless of whether those are the actual conditions in prison, I am not qualified to judge nor do I care for the purposes of this film), and there were several underlying moral questions without clear answers.
Which is another thing: this movie doesn't leave you with all of the answers.  Nothing is left accidentally dangling, but there are several things left for you to chew on.",1074902400,11,1230,4.9227053140096615

But, what a lousy ending.  It had potential.  The scenario is an all too familiar one,  two good-looking American girls find themselves trapped in an Asian prison with seemingly no way out. But, this isn't a jailbait movie, it attempts to address the issue in a serious way, a la Midnight Express, but unfortunately falls flat on its face.
The characters are so unbelievable (except Danes of course).  Fathers who allow their daughters to rot in jail.  A private American lawyer hanging out in Bangkok who wiffs of second-hand Graham Greene novels ready to bail out the girls for a price. A friendship between the two girls that you really have to question in the face of what happens to them, and an ending that will leave you totally exasperated.
I don't suppose this was based on a true story.  Rather, the director seemed in search of some gravitas and needed to concoct an ending that would carry with it the emotional weight he imagined would be the case in such a situation.  But, it is simply too incredible to believe that Danes' character would sell herself in this way.",1071532800,2,1241,4.6045454545454545
1083701,4,6305714886,"Sure, the movie was not (from what I know) completely accurate in terms of the conditions of Thai prisons.  And I do agree at times the prison seemed so sunny, too friendly, too cheerful, etc to be realistic.  But I think that the plot is that of a tale of friendship as much as it is of serving time in a Thai prison.
Most importantly, I think that anyone who is a first time traveler or planning on backpacking throughout Southeast Asia really should see this film.  Darlene and Alice were typical girls from USA Suburbia.  They had just finished school (like many who are about to do a gap year or some backpacking) and went to Thailand because it was exotic, different, faraway... They really didn't know much about Thai culture before they set out.
Sadly, they stayed in Thailand for much longer than they had planned to -- locked up in a women's prision (probably Lard Yao), for carrying drugs.  Without devulging the plot, it is fair to say that they were innocent.
Again, another harsh reminder that if you are heading to Southeast Asia (or really any developing area), you need to be really careful.  Watch this, read Sandra Gregory's ""Forget you Had a Daughter,"" and don't try anything stupid (or don't be coerced, tricked, etc).  Southeast Asia is a wonderful place, and you will have a blast.

Otherwise...this movie was really sad. Not as entertaining as the commericals lead me to believe. The girls were too incredibly naive and arrogant while in another country. Depressing stuff.",1068163200,3,572,4.907216494845361

Nicole Kidman (while still in Australia and unknown) did a powerful TV-mini-series, called ""Bankok Hotel"", about a girl who is wrongfully put in a Thai prison. That series captured the brutality and hopelessness of such a situation in a fascinating and exciting way.
None of that you'll find in Brokedown Place. It's so bad, I couldn't but laugh out loud a few times. Even though Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are trying very hard to give passionate and believable performances, they are hopelessly lost in an unoriginal and unbelievable story full of clichs.
In their effort to market this movie to a certain demographic, the producers have chosen the worst kind of soundtrack for such a topic. Sarah Mclachlan and all the others are totally out of place in those golden-sunlight-Thai-prison montages. Just when you thought it coudn't get any worse, they throw in another catchy song-montage.

1083708,3,6305714886,"The story of friendship tested is interesting, the characters are engaging, the sets are beautiful, the acting is good to excellent, but somehow this tale of two American girls unjustly jailed for drug tracking in Thailand doesn't quite convince.  It's hard to say just what director Jonathan Kaplan might have done differently to make this promising movie an outstanding movie.  But maybe it has something to do with the wrong kind of detail, the accumulated effects thereof.
First we have the sight of the pretty American girls, just out of high school, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) dressed in USA young miss outfits that show off their figures like models on a runway.  You'd think they would dress down a little for the natives, remembering that when in Rome do as the Romans do.  I've watched the Globe Trekker on PBS and the young women there never wear tight skirts and lipstick.  The girls prance about the streets of Thailand on display as though looking for Mr. Right.
Well, of course this being the nineties and not the fifties, they instead find Mr. Wrong.  He charms them and divides them by invoking jealousy, the one of the other.  All of this makes for an interesting premise.  And then we have a nice (if predictable) twist, and the girls end up in prison.
The prison sets are beautiful in a dark and somber way, full of open spaces and diffused colors, guards in pressed uniforms, the other prisoners mostly healthy--pretty even--in clean uniforms with neat tags like charms hanging from the necks.  The fruits and vegetables stacked in the corner of the mess area that the girls are tricked into sampling are fresh and attractive.  Strange.  A palace as a prison.
Somehow--perhaps it was the beauty of the sets--I never really felt the kind of outrage and horror and near hopelessness that such a situation might evoke.  It seemed clear that everything would work out, and the girls would go home soon, leaving the misadventure behind them.
That is not exactly what happens.
See this for Claire Danes who gives a fine performance and almost sells the not-entirely plausible ending.",1045612800,5,2135,4.851239669421488
1083709,3,6305714886,"We have all seen those movies where people are sent to prison and forced to deal with its unpleasant and vulgar nature.  But not like this one.  Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) are sent to rot in a Thai prison for a crime they didn't even know they commited.  What makes the Thai prison so harsh is the fact that it's outside, it's hot, and you don't really get visitation rights.
When Alice and Darlene finish high-school, they tell their parents they're going to Hawaii, when really it's Thailand they're headed for.  All's well for the beginning of the trip, and they even manage to make a new friend, Nick Parks (played by Daniel Lapaine), after he covers a tab they tried to get out of paying for at a hotel.  And, being the handsome Australian he is, is able to woo both of the girls into going to Hong-Kong with him.  But what happens at the airport before going to Hong-Kong is quite the shocker.  Airport security finds drugs on one of their backpacks and takes them away.  Being that this is Thailand, and not America (where we'd probably let this slide the first time), the two are sent to 33 years in the aforementioned prison.  I don't want to give away anything else, but as you can imagine neither are very happy with this sentence; as they do everything they can to be released.
Underrated director Jonathan Kaplan does a lot with a movie I think most people overlook.  He's also able to bring in big-name actor Bill Pullman, who plays Alice and Darlene's lawyer.  The movie is very good, yet the story is similar to the Vince Vaughn movie ""Return To Paradise"".  And if you liked that one I'm sure you'll like this movie.  I gave it 3 stars for two reasons: one, the plot is very similar to that 1998 movie, which was made only a year before ""Brokedown Palace"".

1083710,4,6305714886,"This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.
They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.
The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.
Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.
While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation.

2) This is not about the mystery of who put the drugs in their backpack.  It is a part of the movie but is meant to be pretty obvious it was the Nick Parks character.  It was more about their suspicions about each other.
A lot of the criticism of this film is that the prison is not so terrible and the mystery about who put the drugs in the backpack was not compelling.  OF COURSE NOT, That is not what the movie was about.
That is like criticizing that ""Scarface"" wasn't a great tale of adventures at sea because he came over on a boat.
This movie is about 2 friends.  One is considered the troublemaker who carelessly causes problems for the other.  The other is considered more stable.
They find themselves in a hopeless situation.  (Not one where they are beaten and tortured, which would have not been good for the movie!) In the end, the friend who is considered the selfish troublemaker turns out to be the one who makes a very intense self-less sacrifice for the benefit of the other.
That is what the movie is about.  If you don't judge it on that, then you are not judging it on what it is intended to be.
This is a great movie.  Almost all the characters were exceptionally acted.  Characters were not given more attention than due and all scenes added a lot of emotion to the situations.
The 2 fathers were fabulously acted.  One who sits by idlely feeling he has no power.  The other travels to Thailand and gives a great performance laying a guilt trip on his daughter's friend accusing her of the situation.
Bill Pullman (who I don't usually consider a good actor) surprisingly perfectly portrays their lawyer who is more selfishly concerned with his payment and going on to something else when he doubts their story.  But becomes more concerned with them when he uncovers more information believing they are innocent.  This character realistically had a lot of dimension whose behavior shifts based on the facts of situation.
He has a great chemistry with his wife who is more stable and diligent in uncovering the facts.  She is less selfish and concerned with their payment.  When Hank Green (Bill Pullman's lawyer character) has already made his assessments and gives little attention and technically has abandoned the case, his wife brings more information to him which changes his premature assessment.
Nothing is overdramatized.  The drama is built naturally and realistically, which makes this a better film than others.
I haven't really covered that much about the film except to counter what I feel are the false criticism's of the film.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.

1083734,3,6305714886,"""Brokedown Palace"" is a movie which will probably appeal more to women than to men, as is explores the mysterious world [to men] of female friendship. While it tries hard to be meaningful, it's no ""Thelma and Louise"" in either the dramatic or comedic sense.
Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsdale are Alice and Darlene, two girls who have been best friends all their lives. As a present to themselves, they have planned a vacation together to celebrate their high school graduation. Alice, the more outgoing of the pair, convinces Darlene that this should be a trip they will never forget. She decides that Thailand is a country exotic enough to fill the bill. With some trepidation, Darlene, prodded by Alice, persuades her parents to let her go by insisting the pair is going to Hawaii. Once in Thailand, the girls settle in and start having a good time. Before long, however, they are involved in an incident that lands them in jail. Things go from bad to worse as they become trapped in Thailand's convoluted legal system.
Danes and Beckinsdale are convincing as two naive Americans who get in way over their heads. They convey the terror and confusion that arises then anyone is charged with a serious crime in a foreign land. As Hank and Yon Greene, Bill Pullman and Jaqui Kim are adequate in their fairly small roles as the girls' attorneys.
There is a lot of high drama in ""Brokedown Palace,"" There are also some fundamental script problems. I can't say much about them without spoiling the plot. Basically, much of the drama is forced, causing an ""I'm so sure"" reaction on the part of the viewer. The girls' parents, for example are even more distant emotionally than they are physically. Their reactions cause Darlene and Alice to get deeper into trouble, but it all seems contrived because the parents' behavior is so odd. Added together, these contrivances cause the movie's dark but noble conclusion to lack the impact it could have had. This is unfortunate, because the film's basic question is an important one. Just how far are you willing to go to save your best friend?
The photography is excellent. The Philippines are where the film was shot, but I doubt most of us can tell the difference. There are some splendid songs in ""Brokedown Palace,"" although most of them have precious little to do with the story.",1016582400,,2323,4.766749379652605

1083736,3,6305714886,"I understand that Claire Danes has a number of films in the proverbial can that should see the light of day in 2002.  For those of us who remain forever hopeful that she'll find a vehicle worthy of her talents, this is cause for hope.  For many, her best role to date is still Angela Chase, the precocious, vulnerable and ringingly authentic 90s teen on the series ""My So-Called Life.""
The movies have been, against all predictions, less kind to the young actress.  She usually manages to turn in a solid performance, but even the prestige pieces, like ""Romeo+Juliet"" and ""Les Miserables"" don't really show her off her talents to the best possible effect.  Big productions tend to swallow her up.  For this reason, I have my doubts about the upcoming film version of Michael Cunningham's ""The Hours""--where she'll possibly be one more minor luminary in a stellar cast.
""Brokedown Palace"" is a flawed film, but a reasonably good vehicle for Danes and her co-star, British actress Kate Beckinsale.  As an object lesson in the dangers posed to American youth traveling abroad, this film is pretty effective.  I don't doubt that many young viewers will identify with the two recent high school graduates, who travel on vacation to Bangkok and wind up as pawns in an elaborate drug smuggling scam, facing 35 year prison terms in a filthy Thai jail.  Strong stuff, and the actresses make the best of it.
Certainly, in that sense, it's a better than average ""teen movie.""  It has substance (abused and otherwise), but it still lacks the pacing and the punch of similarly themed efforts like ""Midnight Express.""  See it for two excellent performances by two very gifted young actresses.  But it could have been something much more.  Director Jonathan Kaplan has benefitted before from sterling performances by brilliant young actresses (""The Accused"" garnered Jodie Foster her first Oscar), but this one needs more of a kick-start than even Danes and Beckinsale can manage.",1010793600,,1965,4.939209726443769

1083739,3,6305714886,"The premise of 'Brokedown Palace' is one that instantly uneases  its audience - incarcaration in a foreign jail. Although this issue has been depicted before, this is the first film of its kind to have two female leads as its main focus.
Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale star as two close friends who travel to Thailand in search of adventure, fun and most of all freedom. Along the way they fall for the same mysterious stranger and throw caution to the wind in competing for his affections. After a few days in his company the girls are invited on a trip to Hong Kong so that they can accompany him on a business trip. Trusting his seemingly honest motives, the girls agree and arrange to meet him out there once his work is completed. Once they arrive at the airport they are searched by Thai officials and are found with large quantities of narcotics. Arrested by an army of officers and escorted to a disgustingly dirty holding cell, they are left with nothing except each other, a few hundred cockroaches and a language barrier.  It is here that the drama unfolds and the provocative nature of 'Brokedown Palace' emerges.
The main question raised by the film is of the girls innocence, but the interesting part is that it is never really answered. After fruitless attempts of trying to clear their names ( with the help of expatriate lawyer Bill Pullman ) self - sacrifice becomes the last resort. Here is the films strength - usually tales like this have a black or white ending, but 'Brokedown Palace' delivers a thought-provoking finale that is highly original in it's field.
The only criticisms that I would make about it relate more to location and post - production, than casting or performances. For a start the prison itself is far too tame to create sufficient tension for the audience. Alice ( Danes ) receives a beating from a guard that resembles more of a smack on the legs, and the scariest inmate seems to be a trouble-making adolescent. More time should have been shifted away from the focus of Pullman's character and placed on a much more valuable aspect of the film - the bond between the girls. Neither seem to be bothered by the 33-year prison sentence, nor the mandatory prison haircuts they are forced to have. Not the best idea when trying to capture the horrific conditions and prospects the characters both face.
Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale excell in their respective roles, as do most of the other actors. But over-editing of  decent 'gritty' scenes in the prison create its downfall. Overall 'Brokedown Palace' is a good film with excellent performances by it's leading ladies, but unfortunately a rather lightweight and lacklustre final edit rob it of its potential.
The trailer for 'Brokedown Palace' is literally more scary than the actual film, but other factors such as the love-triangle that emerges, and the strained relationships that surface between the girls and their parents help make it a decent film with pockets of credibility.",995932800,5,2981,4.807017543859649
1083740,5,6305714886,"I thought this was a fantastic movie.  To the other comments given I want to add only this:  When one of the falsely imprisoned girls decides to tell the king that she is guilty so that her friend may go free, it's only the culmination of several  events calculated to build a false sense of guilt in the one who stays behind.  It is tempting, and heartbreaking, to imagine that  this girl who falsely gives herself up has come to the conclusion that, she really is sufficiently guilty to spend her life in prison after all, just on ""general principles"", as it were.  With regard to the drugs themselves, it seemed to me that the girl who ""confessed"" had had it driven into her, by court appearances and months of incarceration, that she was simply guilty because the drugs were in her backpack, since her assertions that she didn't know they were there were useless.  Though this takes place in a foreign country I found the idea of such severe punishment for an unknowing pawn in a crime chilling nonetheless.",991699200,2,1011,4.583333333333333
1083741,3,6305714886,"Upon graduation from High School, two lifelong friends take it upon themselves to alter their post-graduation travel plans, changing the destination of their celebration trip from Hawaii to the more exotic (they think) Thailand.  And for Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), it's but the first of many mistakes they will come to regret in ""Brokedown Palace,"" directed by Jonathan Kaplan.  Of the two, Darlene is the more reserved, conservative one, and when Alice first suggests changing Hawaii for Thailand, Darlene demurs; she knows her father would never allow it.  Which leads them to mistake number two:  They make the arrangements themselves, telling no one, not even their parents, that they've changed destinations.  Initially, they are elated by the freedom the leap from sheltered student to independent adult affords them; unfortunately, they lack the experience and frame of reference needed to successfully negotiate the nuances of a country that is so unlike anything they've ever known.
 They land in Thailand and approach their ""adventure"" with the same casual indifference they would a school field trip, but as they quickly discover, there is no bus waiting to take them home at the end of the day.  Nor are they prepared for the irresistible attention bestowed upon them by the dashing young man they meet-- a traveler as well-- who charms them with some very romantic, and ultimately very dangerous, notions.  They soon learn that being naive in the ways of the real world, and still more innocent than they'd like to admit, can be a lethal combination for two young, unprotected girls in a foreign land.  And in a text book example of learning something the hard way, their epiphany comes too late, and their ""harmless"" decision to change their travel plans ends up changing their lives forever.
 With this film, Kaplan delivers a good, solid and somewhat emotionally involving drama, but it's hardly anything new, and certainly not ground breaking in any way.  In fact, the same territory was covered, only better, in the `98 film, ""Return To Paradise,"" and especially in 1978's ""Midnight Express,"" the most significant difference being that the protagonists here are young, vulnerable women.  The film is well made and acted, but there are no real surprises on hand, and barely enough tension to sustain interest.  The best thing about this movie is the performances by Danes and Beckinsale, both of whom manage to make their respective characters believable.
 There is one aspect of the film that challenges credibility somewhat (and it is only slightly), and that is the fact that these two girls are supposedly lifelong, best friends.  Though they relate well enough to one another, there's a decided lack of evidence that would indicate that kind of closeness between them, especially when compared to the similar kind of relationship depicted in the film ""Heavenly Creatures,"" in which the closeness of the young ladies in question is never in doubt.  The problem, however, is more of a reflection upon the screenplay and the director, than it is on the actors.
 The supporting cast includes Bill Pullman (Yankee Hank), Jacqueline Kim (Yon), Lou Diamond Phillips (Roy), Daniel Lapaine (Nick), Tom Amandes (Doug Davis), Aimee Graham (Beth Ann) and John Doe (Bill Marano).  There's a message in ""Brokedown Place"" that Kaplan holds up like a warning sign for the young, inexperienced adventurer that reads, ""Proceed With Caution!""  But words of wisdom are often impotent and are bound to fall on deaf ears when directed at those engaged in the transition between youth and adulthood, and like Alice and Darlene, there are many who will always insist on taking the hard road to enlightenment.  There's definitely an upside to the frivolity of youth, part of which is unencumbered freedom; but as this film so aptly illustrates, there is decidedly a downside to embracing it carelessly.  And it's a sobering thought that far exceeds this medium through which it is so prudently delivered.",987897600,,4039,5.117199391171994

I know Darlene and Hank never will stop trying, and that's even more important than getting Alice out of there.

1083765,3,6305714886,"High on the list of sadly neglected and wholly underappreciated films of the past several years stands 1998's ""Return to Paradise,"" a tale of three American vacationers who inadvertantly run afoul of the laws of  Malaysia, two of whom must decide whether or not to sacrifice themselves  and return to the brutal third world country to serve their prison sentence  so that the third who has been caught can avoid execution. What is most  remarkable about this film is that it manages not only to set up a  fascinating moral dilemma for both the characters and the audience but,  most amazingly, to stay true and honest to it throughout the course of the  entire film.
""Brokedown Palace,"" whose plot echoes ""Return  to Paradise,"" falls several notches below the earlier film mostly  because it saves its moral dilemma until the very end of the story. The  resolution is a powerful one when it comes, but the delay robs the film as  a whole of some of its interest. In this film, Claire Danes and Kate  Beckinsdale play recent high school graduates who opt to visit Thailand  instead of Hawaii and run into a sleazy young con man who plants heroin on  them - an act for which, when it is discovered by the authorities, the  girls are falsely imprisoned. The bulk of the film concerns itself with the  attempts by an American lawyer (Bill Pullman) to clear their names and  secure their freedom.
Much of the film plays like a rehash of  ""Midnight Express,"" as the girls are badgered and threatened  through their interrogations and forced to endure the rigors of a Third  World prison - although, strangely enough, the horrors seem oddly  downplayed at times. These are the weakest sections of the film for the  visualization of the experience seems almost too glamorized at times, as if  the commercial-minded filmmakers didn't dare risk alienating these  actresses' many fans by offending their sensibilities. Still, the situation  is a ripe one for intense audience identification since who cannot  empathize with a couple of fun loving adolescents caught in a nightmarish  web not of their own making? Actually, the sharpest aspect of the film is  the underlying theme of the scary part seemingly insignificant actions and  decisions can play in determining the course of one's entire life.  Constantly, the girls are forced to wonder ""what if we had gone to  Hawaii...what if we had not met the drug smuggler...what if we had not  snuck into the hotel to order drinks on a stranger's room bill, etc.""  The movie also achieves some depth in its final moments as Alice (Danes)  grapples with a major moral decision and discovers the redemption for a  life built on a pattern of seemingly insignificant deceit and lies. She  realizes that a person's character is made up of ALL the actions she  performs in a lifetime, regardless of how trivial or benign they may seem  at the time. In addition, she learns the often horrifying price true  friendship sometimes demands - and her final actions betoken a personal  maturation that helps lift her character far above the rung of conventional  movie heroines.
""Brokedown Palace"" may occasionally seem  tedious in its details, but the thematic depth and moral underpinnings that  lie within it make it a film worth watching.",964310400,,3267,4.8743169398907105
1083766,4,6305714886,"I know what you were thinking when you saw the trailer or movie poster for this movie: another teen-girl flick that acts as a star vehicle for it's two lead actresses. Wrong. Brokedown Palace is far from being a juvenile  movie; it takes real issues into it's hands and plays those issues out  through the emotions and actions of the characters and their surroundings.  Claire Danes plays Alice, a wild, impulsive girl who, with her more  reserved friend, graduates from high school in the movie's beginning.  Darlene, played by Kate Beckinsdale, is skeptical when Alice suggests going  to Thailand instead of Maui, but goes with er anyway. Upon their arrival,  they spend their days basking in the sun, touring the streets of Bangkok,  and pretending to be guests at an expensive hotel, where they meet a man by  the name of Nick Parks. Both girls, of course, fall for him, with Darlene  ultimately winning out in the end. This puts a small wrench in their  friendship, which is played into as the film progresses. After agreeing to  go to Hong Kong with him, the two girls are arrested without warning from  the airport, accused to attempted narcotic smuggling. This is the point at  which the film's pace quickens dramatically, with the girl's going through  the ins and outs of prison life and trying to get in touch with Yankee  Hank, an American lawyer, played by Bill Pullman. While the story itself  does have a credible amount of tension and emotion, it is the performances  from Danes and Beckinsdale that make the movie a success. The two actresses  play their parts with a large degree of originality, and Pullman's  performance also delivers. Sequences in the Thai prison appear authentic in  nature, and it looks like the filmmakers did their homework before putting  these scenes together. The film is not one that should be dismissed on the  basis of it's appearance, for that can be deceiving. The DVD edition of the  film is lacking, however, in sound quality. Audio jumps for a second in  three different places in the movie, and the overall movie seems to sound a  little lower in volume than most other DVDs.",963964800,2,2129,4.78021978021978

1083769,2,6305714886,"The idea was very good. The performances are good, but it is a Hollywood look at what prison is like over in Thailand. This movie was recommended to me, and I was disappointed. It lost credibility with scenes like the padded  bra with money getting past security. That just wouldn't happen. Also, we  are left to wonder if the blonde girl did in fact know about the drugs in  her pack pack. If you recall she remained in the accommodation room for a  while longer while her friend was at the checkout paying the tab. Now the  silly part was the ending. It was as if the producers decided that the film  had to finish up, so let's get a conclusion quickly. There is no way that  the king would have allowed the blonde girl to run to the front and beg for  her friend's forgiveness. Yes, I realise the film was trying to capture a  strained friendship, but simply put, the Thai law wouldn't free one go over  the other. People go to these prisons and that's it. My point being that  this film could have been so much more if it stuck to a more realistic  storyline. I suggest readers get hold of 'Bangkok Hilton' starring Nicole  Kidman. It was made in 1989. Although it has an unbelievable ending, it  depicts Thai jails more realistically, and not the 'summer camp' style that  'Brokedown Palace' offers.",958867200,14,1304,4.443037974683544
1083770,3,6305714886,"Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college.  It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive  stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in  their luggage.  They get nabbed by the local police and find that justice  in Asia is very different from justice in the U.S.
This is the main story  line for ""Brokedown Palace"" and it was a good one.  The film does  a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of  third world nations.  Actually, the portrayal was rather mild, as the  prison conditions are often far worse than depicted.  It serves as a  reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is  pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.
Unfortunately,  there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the  story.  The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy.  To think that friends  would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra,  and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking  everything brought in from visitors, assumes that either the guards or the  viewers are utter blockheads.
The story also fails to bring closure to  the nagging question of how the drugs got in Alice's (Claire Danes)  backpack.  Did she actually agree to transport the drugs?  We are left to  guess.  It was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence  throughout the film, but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or  both of the girls might be guilty.  Except for this considerable flaw, the  ending was excellent and the results unexpected.
The acting by Claire  Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done.  Danes, who has  been oversold and over hyped, actually arrived as an actor in this film.  Though her portrayal was frequently immature (as was her character), she  improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire.  Beckinsale, in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief  career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in  prison.  Her's was the best performance in the film.
Bill Pullman was  miscast as the lawyer.  His wry and diffident style is an asset in films  like ""While You Were Sleeping"", but as a lawyer in a third world  country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the  wrong personality.
The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it  didn't make me want to go there.
Overall, an entertaining film made  implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes.  I gave it  a 7/10.",955843200,4,2708,4.706008583690987

Danes, who was 20 when the film was released plays Alice Marano.  Beckinsale, 6 years older plays her best friend, Darlene Davis.  Before entering college, the girls decide to take a vacation to Hawaiior so they told their parents.  Alice, the more adventurous of the two, talks Dar into going to Thailand instead.

When they land in Bangkok, they find the city mesmerizing but alas their accommodations weren't first class.  So they slip into one of the 5-star hotels and grab lounge chairs around the pool and order exotic drinks, billing them to (non-existent) hotel rooms.  They get caught but before they can be booted out they are rescued by Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), a handsome Australian.  After a couple nights with Nick, the two girls become jealous of each other as Nick may be wooing them both.

Eventually Nick encourages the girls to go to Hong Kong.  He says hell even pay for the tickets.  But in line at the airport, the girls are busted with cocaine found in one of their backpacks.  Claiming innocence, Darlene signs a confession (in Thai) believing it is just her statement.  They are both sentenced to 33 years in prison.  And its not a great place to live.  The inmates deal with roach infestation, lousy food and all sleep together on the floor in a large room surrounded by guards.  Through a series of letters and a recorded audio tape, the girls get the attention of an American lawyer, Hank Greene (Bill Pullman) whose wife, Yon (Jacqueline Kim) is a native and also a lawyer.

The film is directed by Jonathan Kaplan (Bad Girls) who more recently has produced and directed TV fare.  In some ways this film feels a bit like a made for TV movie, but at the same time deals with friendship and how far you might go to preserve it.  The actors are all pretty good, well except for Lou Diamond Phillips who plays some honcho at the American Embassy.  The film doesnt dive too deep into the disgusting conditions at the prison, nor does it delve into the girls sexual flirtation with Nick.  Still there was enough here to keep me interested and entertained.  There is also a nice soundtrack featuring two of my favorite Sarahs (McLachlan and Brightman).

By some accounts this story is based on true events, but I couldn't come up with anything substantive.  Adam Fields, one of the writers, did travel to Thailand on occasions and may have obtained some of his ideas while doing so.  There was a similar story that has been documented in film.  That being of Billy Hayes being incarcerated in Turkey.  The 1978 film Midnight Express starring Brad Davis is a harrowing portrayal, much grimmer than this movie.",1517788800,,2822,4.706122448979592
