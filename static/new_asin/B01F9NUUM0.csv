8760510,2,B01F9NUUM0,"We love the series and had been waiting a long time for it to be released in DVD form.  We enjoy the storylines very much.  Too bad the technical reproduction doesnt measure up to the great writing done in these programs.  This series was a class act and it has been reproduced here in a rather shoddy way.  First, the fidelity is noticeably poor in that the color rendition is so faded that is almost appears black and white in some episodes.  Secondly, there are noticeable gaps in the programs.  At first, it wasn't apparent, but became clear there were entire scenes excised.  Primarily the epilogues which, we believe were present in all the original programs of the series.  That seems like a small thing, however, it was one of the elements of each program that gave it a lot of its charm.  Also, the Act number designations throughout the program were something unique in this series and they are missing.  Of course, we enjoy the episodes, no question, but we paid for these Seasons in their entirety as they aired originally. We accept that some loss of quality always occurs with dubbing, but not to this extent.",1521331200,2,1123,4.626262626262626
8760511,3,B01F9NUUM0,"I received season three of Barnaby Jones today.  So far, I've watched the first couple of episodes and although its fun to be able to watch Barnaby in action again, I'm a little disappointed by the picture quality,the colors are really washed out.  Also, although it didn't affect the stories, it is obvious this is the syndicated version of the show, for instance,  missing are the act titles that appeared in the original uncut episodes.  That all being said, I am excited to watch the remaining episodes and I am planning on purchasing the remaining seasons.",1512000000,2,561,4.8125
8760512,1,B01F9NUUM0,"Terrible, Terrible Video.  Very contrasty washed out  fuzzy picture. If you like Barnaby Jones, this V. E. I. compilation may exist as better than Nothing. But not as good as a 39 year old VHS played on an old VCR.  The Only Good compilation of Barnaby Jones was Season One when Paramount was licensed to make the first season in 2010. This V.E.I. DVD Set in 2016 is Positively Terrible. The DVD case and information is Identical to the 2010 Paramount compilation, Except for the Very Fine Print that says Licensed by CBS to Visual Entertainment Inc., Toronto , ON, Canada  Very Sad that Paramount didn't manufacture all of the seasons. Season one was Perfect.",1502496000,4,660,4.71304347826087

8760514,5,B01F9NUUM0,"My husband and I love watching these shows of Barnaby Jones again.  There is no violence, which is refreshing, and they are in pretty good shape considering how old they are.",1492300800,,174,4.612903225806452
8760515,5,B01F9NUUM0,"Totally enjoyed these old stories. It's interesting, also, to see some celebrities that have gone on to become well known. I'll stop at Season 6, when too many of the episodes revolved around Betty the secretary and that pesky nephew.",1490313600,3,234,4.875

8760518,5,B01F9NUUM0,"Barnaby Jones is back! for another great season of classic detective shows! This season is as good as 1, 2 and 4 with some classic episodes.
The quality is good and better than any of the bootlegs sold but I agree they are not perfect which is sad that CBS didn't restore properly but
well worth having this great show. Seasons 1 thru 4 was before JR joined the cast and the best of the series. A must have for all TV fans.",1466553600,3,423,4.108433734939759
8760519,1,B01F9NUUM0,"Great TV show. But this is a cheap deal.. And they leave the Closed Caption off of it.
And Yes it's on it.  But this Co is t cheap to pay to get the set with the CC on it..",1463961600,6,172,3.3
