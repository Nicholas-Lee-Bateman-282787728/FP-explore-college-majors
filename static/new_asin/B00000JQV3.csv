1238572,5,B00000JQV3,"This is an amazingly good film with a superlative performance by John Hurt in the role of Quentin Crisp, a flamboyant English homosexual in the days when being such was anything but comfortable. Brilliantly played by Hurt, Crisp was a born in 1908 and was aware that he was different from an early age. He grew up in an era where homosexuality was not an option as a life style. Still, he managed to make it in a world that was decidedly unfriendly to those like him. Witty and self assured, he lived his life as he wanted, despite the hardships he faced due to his self professed homosexuality. He was a trailblazer and poster boy for an alternative life style.

John Hurt deservedly won the British Best Actor award for his incisive portrayal of Quentin Crisp. It is no wonder that his performance was critically acclaimed. It is nothing short of brilliant. His  is a touching and sympathetic portrayal of an individual who wanted nothing more than to be able to be himself. It is a performance that is not to be missed. The film is an absolute gem.",1011052800,22,1051,4.526315789473684
1238573,5,B00000JQV3,"""John Hurt"", quoth Quentin Crisp, ""is my representative on earth."" And so he is. The two men become indistinguishable. I bought this film because I wanted to see John Hurt and didn't really care in whatever character - in fact I was afraid this might be a silly exploitative fairy comedy like ""A cage of fools"". But then I got captivated, and not only because Hurt makes a really cute fairy (and shows so much skin). The film has a lot of atmosphere, there are many witticisms - my favorite is Quentins reason why he thinks he'd make a good soldier: ""Anyone can get killed. Even I can do that."" There is so much that is ridiculous and sometimes repulsive, so much that is sad, or funny, or deeply moving like the courtroom scene. In the end the film left me wondering why a man must suffer so much for simply being different, when his being different hurts no one.",1002672000,21,864,4.40625
1238574,4,B00000JQV3,"So Quentin Crisp himself tells us in the little intro he does to this depiction of his life story. And ""The Naked Civil Servant"" is a far cry from being the WORST thing I've ever seen. I stumbled across this movie, and I'm certainly glad I did--it's a real hoot! John Hurt does an excellent job playing Quentin, who learns bit by bit to follow his own dictates and live a gay lifestyle in the 1920s, right up through 1975. Along the way, he collects an off-beat coterie of friends, including Lord Alcohol and The Pole. One of the oddest things about the movie for me is how pretty John Hurt looks--he actually bears a striking resemblance to Sarah Churchill, Fred Astaire's love interest in ""Royal Wedding"", which I suppose she wouldn't like hearing, but there it is.  ""The Naked Civil Servant"" makes an excellent pitch for toleration of those who lifestyles differ from the mainstream.",994982400,5,886,4.67948717948718
1238575,5,B00000JQV3,"This British production is nothing short of brilliant! John Hurt (always superlative), in what may be his very best, and most memorable delivery so far, as England's most contrevertial homosexual.

1238576,5,B00000JQV3,"The great British eccentric is often referred to but really seen.  The late Quintin Crisp was a glorious example.  A man whose sexual identity was confused from a very early age allows The Naked Civil Servant to reveal his  struggles to become accepted in a stiff society still heavily influenced by  the Victorian era.  A man who would brazenly wear make-up, flamboyant  clothes and was openly homosexual and paid dearly for his defiance of the  morals of the day.  It is a story of remarkable courage and despite its  content this is not a 'gay' film.  It is an absorbing drama about one man  and his attempts to change the rigid system.  Filled with humor and wit, it  also depicts tragedy and pain.  Superbly played by John Hurt in the role  that brought him to world wide attention, it is a drama of the highest  order.",950918400,8,824,4.541095890410959

1238589,5,B00000JQV3,"Although I don't agree with that lifestyle and will never understand it, back when this was shown all the time on the local independent channel back when I and my blokes were in hi-skuel back in the 70s, we all conceded that we think Quentin Crisp is an incredibly bizarre character and that, ""in spite of"", he was very cool.  Crisp had a sense of humor about himself, very unlike most who are involved in that lifestyle.  This was reflected in the way he carried himself and in his choices of sartorial style.
I had recently discovered punk rock at the time, and perhaps that prepared me to have an appreciation for him.  He lived to ""shock"" every bit as much as Sid Vicious or Johnny Rotten, and he was doing this decades before.
The film is very bizarre and jarring, and seemed especially so to us small-town Texas hillbillies back when it first appeared.
Crisp seemed highly intelligent.  His wit was formidable and cutting.

I very much hope that maybe something happened before he experienced his final breath and that he is in a great place, and that he is living in a blissful state.

Even his NAME is funny.",1407283200,,1116,4.527363184079602
1238590,5,B00000JQV3,"Enjoyed watching this movie after many years. It's great that times have changed and homophobia is less than it was. It would be wonderful if it was completely gone, but I guess there's always those who are judgmental and haters, that is sad!",1388016000,,242,4.651162790697675

1238592,5,B00000JQV3,Having been fortunate to have both seen on stage and later met Mr Crisp on his visit to Australia one has to concur with his coomments regarding the disastrous folly of so called 'gay liberation'.This once television drama is a testament to subtlety and wit as much as it is a masterpiece of production and acting.,1353456000,,314,4.625
1238593,5,B00000JQV3,"Quentin Crisp, I had heard the name so many times, but never knew what a true legend he was, and how terrifically inspiring his story was.

I am an Anglophile; pure and simple. I love everything about Blighty, and I have many close friends around Manchester, but I was born on the wrong continent.

I first heard of Mr. Crisp whilst reading Boy George's autobiograpy, Take It Like A Man. I knew nothing of the name, but I figured he was another pointless gay celebrity, in the vein of Andy Warhol.

The first time I watched this film was on Netflix. Immediately hooked. A movie that looks at life in Britian for an outsider during the early to mid 20th century. This is a topic rarely featured in any big budget Hollywood film, and I ate it up.

Quentin is semi-robotic, but one will find themselves cheering him on. He lives his life his way, without regret and apology. He even stands up to the bigots of the UK law enforcement and court.

The gay community owes more to this extrovert then any other. Would boundary pushers like David Bowie or Boy George enjoyed such mainstream success if not for Quentin Crisp, absolutely NOT.

This movie has it all, historic storyline, fight of the underdog, intrigue, heart, and soul. A recommendation for any anglo-philes and history lovers alike, (just b/c it's not part of ""your history"" doesn't mean it isn't history). I would even watch this film with my mom, it's that touching.

I could live my life off Quentin's humourous quips and spot on observations of society, and now I do!

Buy it, rent it, LOVE it.",1331683200,3,1555,4.568345323741007
1238594,5,B00000JQV3,"I originally saw ""The Naked Civil Servant"" about 20 years ago.  I was impressed with the fortitude Quentin Crisp faces a society that gladly rejects him.  However, in his court scene, real people in his life take a stand for his character. His eloquence throughout the movie is remarkable and beyond clever.  An extremely important film, to be sure!  Quite entertaining, too!!",1325289600,,376,5.016129032258065
1238595,4,B00000JQV3,"The first time I became aware of Quentin Crisp was watching him play Queen Elizabeth I in the gender-generation bending ORLANDO starring Tilda Swinton. I loved that movie & was really struck by Crisp's short but memorable performance. It was odd in that it was so unique, so different from what you'd expect. I really wasn't sure if the actor was male or not & only realized the truth during the roll of credits at the end. That was all I knew about Crisp until being enlightened by THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT. This is another instance where I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. 4 stars for the overall production, 5 stars for John Hurt. His is a hands-down bravura performance, a testament of humanity--and damn funny too. It really gave me a lot of respect for Quentin Crisp who, much like Truman Capote, had the courage to be who he was without the shame society expected both men to suffer from. Hurt's performance is quietly stellar and without pathos or melodrama. The message is clear: Be yourself & you will achieve.",1320278400,,1017,4.562841530054645

1238608,5,B00000JQV3,"I have watched this movie so many times! The acting, writing, music, just perfect. Those Brits - so darn talented. This role made John Hurt, and the supporting cast is marvelous. You gotta love it when the smallest parts are little gems of acting. The climax of the movie is achingly moving.

The whole piece has a light air, but it is the story of a courageous individual who made a life on the fringes of society, and succeeded. Well worth your time.",1282089600,,452,4.445783132530121
1238609,5,B00000JQV3,"The Naked Civil Servant is a fascinating biopic by the BBC about the life and times of Quentin Crisp, although because it was filmed in 1975 it does not cover his life in the United States after he moved here from Great Britain. However, the movie is still quite good and very engaging; I was not bored in the least. The acting is impeccable: John Hurt turns out a superlative performance as Quentin Crisp; and the rest of the casting was very well done. We truly get the sense of what Quentin Crisp was about and what he experienced; and that's the hallmark of a fine biopic. The quality of the print could have been a bit better in spots but overall it's still quite good.

We see how Quentin's preference for romance with men quickly caused discord between him and his parents from an early age. Mr. and Mrs. Crisp (Lloyd Lamble and Joan Ryan) call in a doctor (Frank Forsyth) to see if Quentin can be ""cured"" but the doctor disappoints his two parents; Quentin's father was particularly nasty toward him. It's no wonder Quentin left home for good as soon as he was able to! In addition, we see Quentin's countless ups and downs as well as his coping strategies, most of which are the result of his insistence of dressing in a rather flamboyant way, dying his very long hair red and essentially simply being openly gay in a place and time when being gay was completely unacceptable. Unfortunately, Quentin gets beaten up quite a bit; but he also experiences some happiness at parties with friends who accept him for the human being that he is and that's a plus.

We also see some of Quentin's interpersonal relationships with other men. There's the fellow who goes by the nickname ""Thumbnails"" (Colin Higgins); ""Thumbnails"" is Quentin's roommate early on after Quentin leaves his childhood home. Some of the men Quentin meets are for brief encounters; one man whom Quentin refers to as ""Barndoor"" (John Rhys-Davies) stays in his life for almost three years.

Quentin eventually enters modeling; and this is the point at which he begins to refer to himself as a ""Naked Civil Servant."" No, John Hurt who plays Quentin is not literally naked in these scenes; but John Hurt's costume is scant to say the least.

The DVD comes with a few nice extras: we get a featurette with Quentin Crisp himself; an optional audio commentary and scene selection. There are optional English subtitles for those of us who need them.

I could tell you more of Quentin's life and experiences that you'll see on this DVD; but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that this is a very well done biopic; and the opening brief introduction by Quentin Crisp himself is done in good taste. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is interested in the life and times of Quentin Crisp; and people who are interested in gay life in England when being gay was still considered a mental illness would do well to get this film.",1243641600,2,2913,4.583493282149712
1238610,4,B00000JQV3,"This film is every bit as evocative as I remember watching as a child in the UK. The amazing story, not only of how someone could be so famous for nothing, but of the struggle to be accepted. This is a terrific movie for gays and straights everywhere. I don't believe that Quentin Crisp made homosexuality acceptable, but I think it would have took a little longer without him. Lastly, if you need any more proof of the brilliance of the man,  Sting and Gina X, to name but two, wrote songs about this movie!",1233014400,3,508,4.347368421052631
1238611,5,B00000JQV3,"I knew Quentin Crisp at the end of his life (for about twenty-six months, we ending up going out to a dinner, flick or play with a party of friends practically every weekend), and John Hurt has him down pat in this glorious film.  CIVIL SERVANT, in either its English tv incarnation or book version, was most Americans' introduction to the unique Mr. C., and remains both a great jumping-off place to begin exploring Crisp-World, and one of the best film biographies ever.  Like Henry Higgins' definition of good manners, Quentin was always the same to everyone, in every circumstance; public or private, the man remained his own spectacular creation, and the marvelous Hurt shows the origins of what was to become an internationally celebrated life.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and highly, highly recommended.",1190678400,6,805,5.083333333333333
1238612,5,B00000JQV3,"I was delighted to see this release coming out, so I pre-ordered.  Had some concerns, considering how long ago the BBC production aired in the US.  I know I was in college, and I was very impressed with John Hurt's performance.

Seeing this some 27 years later, it still impresses me.  My wife saw this and exclaimed that John Hurt really is a good actor.  She now understands why I attempt to see every movie he is in.  Even if it is just a walk-on part.

Full screen format was disappointing, but the print quality is very good.  Sound is Mono, but then I would expect that of a 27 year old TV movie.

By the way, the subject matter is handled with as much grace as possible, but it is blunt.  The court room scene makes the message.",1181347200,6,735,4.223021582733813

1238615,5,B00000JQV3,"""The Naked Civil Servant"" has long been one of very favorite books, and now Jack Gold has brought that story to life in this superb film.  Quentin Crisp was a pioneer of the 'silence = death' philosophy adopted by the gay rights movement in the 80's and 90's.  An uninhibited homosexual in a time when it was illegal, Crisp never lost his wit or his dignity dispite living through poverty, malicious prosecution and physical abuse.  John Hurt - long a favorite for his work in ""10 Rellington Place,"" ""Midnight Express,"" ""The Elephant Man,"" ""Love and Death on Long Island"" and ""Scandal"" - won a much deserved Best Actor award from the British Film Academy for his work here.

I don't doubt that things such as Mr. Crisp endured, still happen, but who am I to judge my neighbour. The courage Quentin Crisp displayed in order to be himself is laudable. Not a movie for homophobes, but for those safe in their sexuality, a very informative view into a world many of us will never know. There is also the underlying and scathing indictment of a society that feels justified in vilifying, ostracizing or worse, certain member who do not fit the accepted norm.

7913486,5,B00000JQV3,"To say John Hurt is a treasure is an understatement.  No matter where this man has appeared, on the stage, the big screen or on Television, his range and depth are always spot on and the palette of colors with which he tones his characters is astounding.  He is, quite simply, an actor's actor.  In this autobiographical account on the life of Quentin Crisp he gives a performance beyond inspiring.  In fact, one might almost believe Crisp had, himself, played the lead.  For one thing, they bear facial and bodily similarities but the real icing on the cupcake are the cadence of speech, facial expressions and mannerisms of Crisp.  They are so uncanny that one must remind themselves they are not watching Quentin Crisp!  A great touch is that Crisp gives us a glimpse of himself as he was then, in the filmed introduction to the film.  The supporting cast are all wonderful and you may recognize the young, somewhat slimmer, John Rhys-Davies, who portrays ""Barndoor,"" Crisp's paramour of some duration. Jack Gold directed what seems to have been an ensemble cast and he did it splendidly.

The story begins circa 1913 with Crisp as a young boy of tender years, ogling himself in a mirror, in what looks to be a drape of fabric and beads moving to music but the action begins some years later as Quentin is looking at himself and preening in a mirror as his thoroughly disenchanted, disgusted and bewildered father catches him at it and asks: "" Do you intend to spend your entire life admiring yourself?""  Quentin answers him, in all seriousness, and says: ""If I possibly can."" And so it begins.  Throughout the story you will marvel at how this man pulled off his brand of, beyond flamboyant, homosexuality in England of the 1930's and beyond.  Trundling down the streets of Soho in London in flaming red Hennaed hair, full make-up and sandals, showing off his painted toe nails as well.  He is denied service in WW II and branded as a homosexual ""suffering from sexual perversion"" ultimately taking on work as an artist's model...an occupation he held onto for three decades!  Bear in mind that, unlike today, Crisp is not a political or social figure and has no agenda other to be who he is.  He lives according to his own sense of things in a world he does not back down from and a world he asks no favors of.  He is utterly likeable, intelligent, enjoyable, thoroughly remarkable and John Hurt plays him to the teeth!
