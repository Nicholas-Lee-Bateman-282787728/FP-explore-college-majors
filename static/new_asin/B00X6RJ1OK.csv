7159874,1,B00X6RJ1OK,I thought the movie was very boring,1444867200,,35,4.142857142857143
7159875,3,B00X6RJ1OK,"This movie is beautifully filmed & the sad cello music weaves in & out of scenes. Vincent is really wonderful in this tale about an immature married couple struggling in their relationship. More visual, sometimes conversation fades off in the distance. You feel as though you're on board this ship as an observer. First time seeing Vincent as someone other than Pete, but guess what his name is in this movie?",1443139200,,409,4.774647887323944
7159876,4,B00X6RJ1OK,"Very artsy and indy. No real plot to speak of; the beautiful scenery of the artic, seals, penguins, icebergs, etc, and soundtrack makes up for it. Very relaxing. Nice mix of documentary-like visuals with light storyline.",1441411200,,220,5.138888888888889
7159877,1,B00X6RJ1OK,"Positive:
To whomever invented FF.
Negatives:
1. Glacial - as one person described it. Well, if watching ice melt is your thing then have at it.
2. If sharing ""selfies"" with the world and former friends (used to be friends until you inundated them with ""selfies"") then the preponderance of head/facial closeups, mostly of our couple, will have you screaming for an escape.
3. If simulated sex on a bunk bed excites, there is some of that too, but it was pretty boring.
4. Not very believable expedition behavior on the part of everyone from scientists to ship captain. Acting was too scripted, and rote reading robotic.
5. Even the more documentary aspects were brief and cheap e.g. whale in ocean, penguin on land, ice wherever it happens to pop up.
6. Even the background music throughout the film didn't fit with the environment. Sounded monotonic like a cello out of tune. I suppose it was to represent isolation/vast desolation. I would just as soon go into a closet and shut the door.",1438560000,3,990,4.728323699421965
7159878,4,B00X6RJ1OK,"While the pace of Red Knot is fairly glacial [excuse the pun], this intentional cadence was set to match life on the ship and its surroundings. The trailer (as one of the extras on the DVD) suggests that the love triangle is the plot; instead, the captain (Billy Campbell) is more of an incidental rather than a pivotal character. Billy Campbell is one of those actors with a face you'll recognized despite not knowing where you saw it... for me it was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4400/dp/B001CQONMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4400</a>&nbsp;(as Jordan Collier).

As for the other actors, this is a chance for you to see what Vincent Kartheiser is like outside of Mad Men, and Red Knot is as good an introduction to Olivia Thirlby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Goes-Up/dp/B0028X4YHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Goes Up</a>) as any of the numerous other indie films she's had an important role in.
Real-life husband & wife Roger Payne and Lisa Harrow round out the cast. Roger Payne (not an actor, he's instead been in several documentaries) is a famous whale biologist, and snipets of dialogue between him and Vincent Kartheiser are artfully interwoven into the story, giving Red Knot just the slightest residue of a PBS science/ ecology show.

The scenes were skillfully edited, strung together creatively but logically. Accorded with a fitting economy of dialogue, words were not said when words were not needed. The composer for the soundtrack hit all the right notes and captured the Antarctic about as well as can be anticipated.

PG-13? Not even: the newlywed sex scene is so tame that Red Knot might earn a PG rating from the MPAA (if it were to be rated). That said, the movie isn't for kids (it would bore them).

Before ordering I was unhappy that Red Knot isn't offered on Blu-ray, but as it turns out, the transfer to DVD is flawless. As decent as it was, I now feel the need to travel and experience Antarctica firsthand.

Extras:
Too often, DVD extras are relegated to just the dang movie trailer. Not so here. There are 2 interviews with Scott Cohen (screenwriter/ director/ producer for Red Knot), one with Vincent Kartheiser, and one with composer Garth Stevenson. Although brief, these bonus features are revealing for audiences and filmmakers alike.

 Final verdict: this was a successful experiment of putting a small cast and film crew together on a ship at the edge of the world for 23 days and having something come out of it that can be enjoyed by more than just those who participated in the adventure.",1438387200,,2631,5.220379146919432
7159879,3,B00X6RJ1OK,"The cinematography is really beautiful and some of the Scientists and Researchers are actually the real people...but thats about it. The lead characters are pretty wooden, and you don't really care whether they make up or not. Very slow moving, but keeps your attention. You keep thinking, ""this could really go somewhere interesting...""  The only problem is that there is little to no pay off. The ""climax"" is in the last few minutes of the film and doesn't really make much sense and is fairly vague. Maybe budget made it impossible to film much on land? Don't know. Could have been so much better. Meh.",1438300800,2,605,4.761904761904762
7159880,1,B00X6RJ1OK,Save your time! Not a movie worth watching,1437177600,3,42,4.375
7159881,4,B00X6RJ1OK,"I really enjoyed this film. It was a drama about a newlywed couple who were going to Antarctica, via a research vessel for their honeymoon. The two lead characters are Peter and Chloe and Peter has always dreamed of going to both of the Poles, exploring and writing about his explorations. He's very excited about being on the boat with some notable biologists, whale researchers and in his excitement, he starts to leave his new wife alone and unseen. Of course, this doesn't sit well with Chloe and there's a lot of tension between the two. I don't want to spoil the story because I think it's a really well made movie and the scenery and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking!! It's worth a watch for that alone. There are other elements to the story, of course, one including a very good-looking captain, but that's all I'll say. I mainly watched it because no one had left a review on it and it looked fairly interesting to me and now I'm glad I watched it.",1436572800,9,967,4.563218390804598
8715200,5,B00X6RJ1OK,"Such a delicate wisp of a film.  The artful cinematography, with more focus on  animals and nature than the character, owes more to Terrence Malick than Roman Polanski (the latter is explicitly referenced); there is even a down-the-ship's-bow shot right out of _The Thing Red Line_.  But director Cohen has a vision uniquely his own too.  The ending is deliciously ambiguous.  The music is terrific too, so much better than in standard American Indie films.  (One of the ""passengers"" on the boat is named ""Juliette Binoche.""  Just someone with the same name as the actress?)  A unique film, and almost a revelation.  Bravo!",1528934400,,623,4.970873786407767
8715201,4,B00X6RJ1OK,"Great music, great photography. Very suspenseful, waiting for something to happen. Seriously, though,  Im the kind of person who can amuse himself with a lot of nice visual scenes  the ocean swelling, whales swimming, sea birds soaring, a camera slowly coming into focus. Its like visiting an art museum. You don't expect cars crashing and women screaming at an art museum. I was happy here just to be witnessing a trip to Antarctica. The film has a nice, slow pace that allows one to enjoy the visual and the musical. I thought it was a good film, not very long. I wasn't crazy about the relationship between the two stars, also feelings of apprehension and sadness, but those were big parts of the film.",1520640000,,705,4.67741935483871
8715202,4,B00X6RJ1OK,"What I liked most was the cast, and the beautiful senere. The ambiguous ending was a dissapointment. Did they survive or perish in the storm?",1517184000,,141,4.68
8715203,1,B00X6RJ1OK,So bad it's almost great. No story. No character development. Can't even hear anyone speak. Icebergs are pretty... But what is the point?,1504051200,,137,5.0
8715204,5,B00X6RJ1OK,"A great art film by an incredible director, Red Knot is a wonderfully shot film.
The acting is true to character, with genius charisma between the main protagonists.
If the title and overall flow of the film aren't easily palatable, may I suggest going here:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_knot

Once you've grasped a general understanding of the nomenclature behind the working title, it's easy to spot the overt similarity and subtle parallels behind the name.  I won't spoil it for you, but the film will definitely have a different perspective.  Happy viewing!",1453852800,,570,5.370786516853933
8715205,3,B00X6RJ1OK,"It was okay. Good acting, I guess, good story, possibly. Really was just an okay movie. I'd recommend it only if free.",1449532800,,118,4.409090909090909
8715206,1,B00X6RJ1OK,had to turn it off. one of the most depressing movies I have ever watched. a dark dreary lost at see feeling on top of relationship heartbreak..... no thanks. Perhaps just too close to home for me,1449100800,,196,4.324324324324325
8715207,5,B00X6RJ1OK,I am a Vincent Kartheiser fan and I liked the movie. There were times though that it was a little confusing as to the ending of the movie. I still thought it was good.,1446595200,,167,3.9411764705882355
8715208,1,B00X6RJ1OK,Some nice scenery but a mediocre plot.,1445558400,,38,4.571428571428571
8715209,2,B00X6RJ1OK,"The acting is decent, but the characters are underdeveloped; the dialogue and scenery are boring; and the plot is so full of holes as to be non-existent.  The director intentionally omits scenes so that the audience has to guess at possible plot developments, but you end up with the feeling that nothing interesting actually happened, and you don't get any answers by the end of the movie.  The pace and music have the hypnotic, dreamlike effect of being on a ship, but it is a long, dull voyage.  If you are thinking of watching this movie to learn more about the Antarctic or a research vessel, or because you think the setting will create some interesting adventure/peril, you will be disappointed.  You may like this movie if you enjoy art-festival films for the sake of discussion afterwards, since each person may have formed different impressions about what happened in some scenes; however, it's likely to be a very short discussion.  You are more likely to appreciate this movie if you have insomnia and need something undulating and uneventful to lull you to sleep.",1445040000,,1076,4.85792349726776
