7688849,5,B01CQOVH8Q,"This is a great 4-pack of movies.  I found this at Walmart for five bucks, Pure Luck was a movie I had been meaning to buy for a while and I had only seen one other movie in the collection so I decided to get it.  These are all pretty good movies, except for maybe Junior, that was the low point of this collection for me, it's an okay movie, just kind of weird, and I didn't really find it that funny.  I always thought that Pure Luck was underrated as a comedy, it does have some great moments going for it.  Twins was the other movie that I had seen, but it had been a long time since I had watched it.  Twins was better than I remembered it being, I liked more than I thought I would.  Dragnet was a surprise, I could have done without the whole Pagan bad guy thing, but besides the one scene in the middle that I skipped it wasn't such a huge deal, and I found it pretty funny.  Overall this is a great value, the movies are pretty good, the discs are good quality even if they are only DVDs, and if you only like one or two of the movies you're not spending too much money for them, all in all a great deal.",1474588800,,1113,3.9419642857142856
7688850,5,B01CQOVH8Q,"Love Pure Luck, it is so funny. Also enjoy Twins and Junior, Emma Thompson does comedy wonderfully. Have not watched Dragnet yet, but having it with the other movies gives me the opportunity to watch it. A good deal for a fun group of movies.",1472083200,,242,4.4

7688857,4,B01CQOVH8Q,"I purchased this collection because it was the only place I could find Twins in widescreen.  The picture quality is good for all four titles.  Twins is great fun.  Junior is a nice bonus.  Pure Luck is pretty bad, and Dragnet is absolutley terrible, but that DVD can stay in the case.  The two Arnold movies share the other DVD, and that one makes the collection definitely worth having.",1517616000,2,387,4.550724637681159

gave it 3 stars. In fact, I bought it for the movie

Didn't like some of the language in this movie
and thought it ruined what could have been
very good.",1492732800,,249,3.7169811320754715
