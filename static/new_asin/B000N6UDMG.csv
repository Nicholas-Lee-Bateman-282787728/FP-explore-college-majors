8259538,4,B000N6UDMG,"I found this video quite charming, and a very nice way to introduce children to Krishna's pastimes.
Though it does appear to be mainly produced for children I also found it enjoyable, but then I love both cartoons and stories from the Vedas.
The one I was sent was a VCD rather than a DVD, but it still worked fine in my player.",1215820800,3,328,4.222222222222222
