A fun film about a now defunct slaughterhouse owner, his interesting son (who can't talk, he only makes pig noises) and the people trying to get him to sell his slaughterhouse to a guy who's only interest is profits from selling bad pork.
The death scenes are good and sometimes very funny. The acting at times is very cliche' for 1980's, but still fun.",1089763200,2,472,4.2555555555555555

1057504,5,6305663068,"Slaughterhouse, a beautifully scripted masterpiece of 80's brilliance showcases the lovely young actress Sherry Bendorf. Smart and sassy, Bendorf masterfully portrays a young woman (excellent casting, because Bendorf herself is a woman) who for some reason wanders through a slaughterhouse with her hip young friends, or ""homies"". Within the slaughterhouse lurks some kind of evil, fixing to hatch a diabolical scheme and commit murder! Ms. Bendorf was born for this role. Her superb dialogue skills and facial expressions  complement every scene...pure perfection. Better known for her short, but dramatically explosive role in the film, ""Demonwind"", in which she is mystically transformed into a doll, Bendorf makes ""Slaughterhouse"" truly one of the American classics.  The ending of Slaughterhouse is also genius, leaving the possibility open for a sequel. I think we would all agree, the world needs more Sherry Bendorf... amazing Sherry Bendorf.

Then a group of busness people warn Buddy's father that they are going to tear down the slaughterhouse, the two hatch a plan, the bring them in and then butcher them one by one. Also a bunch of teenagers plan to make a horror movie in the Slaughterhouse as well.  Slaughterhouse is a nice slasher movie that came out in the late 80s. The killer Buddy runs around with some sort of Axe/Meat cleaver and he sure knows how to use it but that isn't the only weapon used as lots of items come into play. The plot is nothing special it's your basic kill kill kill movie but there is a sense of fun here. Slaughterhouse is not a movie to be taken to seriously, I know the makers didn't. There is lots of gore but probably nit as much as you might think of from a film with the title of Slaughterhouse.  The only problems with Slaughterhouse is that it tends to be a little bit slow at times and the ending is really bad but other then that this is great.",981072000,5,1113,4.1720930232558135
1057506,1,6305663068,"Rick Roessler's low budget, low class, quality stricken, and unbelievably hokey 1987 slasher film catastrophe about a demented son of a failed  slaughterhouse owner (named Buddie WOW! ) that kills teenage deviants who  play, frolic, and make love in the dilapidated remains of the family  business is one of the most insulting injuries to any film audience I have  ever witnessed in all my years of movie watching. I've seen High School  play productions that have more entertainment value than this putrid  abomination of cinema.
First of all, the story's hero Buddie is a  squealing imbecile whose sole only purpose in the movie is to chase horny  teenagers around with sharp and lethal objects. Buddie happens to like  police officers, well not enough to spare their lives but enough to wear a  very small police officer outfit over his very large frame. So you have a  very over weight idiot running around in tight police uniform as he maims,  fondles, and kills scantly clad women on or near the ruins of a slaughter  house. Secondly the acting is very self-conscious and pathetic as you have  the typical teen couples investigating a mostly unoccupied building for  noises, and I bet you can guess what happens next. Finally, I have never  seen one-dimensional kills being executed so absurdly and such an  unintentionally funny manner. Have our expectations for slasher films  gotten so lame, that we have to endure quality blemishes the size of  Slaughterhouse. I hope not.",969321600,8,1482,4.975510204081632

In what other movie can you see a huge,  greasy man-child make pig noises while chopping screaming teenagers into  itty bitty pieces?

Do I like the  film?, yes I do, but only because of its low budget sensiblities that raise  it from the usual dreck of non-originality. On the DVD, there is a good  directors commentary track which provides insight into the film's  production.

1057706,5,6305663068,"Similar to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Motel Hell, Slaughterhouse is a horror-comedy.

Plot- When Les Bacon's slaughterhouse is facing foreclosure, he and his hulking son-Buddy tear up those who oppose them.  Meanwhile teens who are making a horror movie mess around in the slaughterhouse, bad idea!

My Thoughts- I love this movie, it is delightfully wicked. May favorite characters are Lester and his son Buddy, they written well-and delightfully psychotic. Buddy intimidates is victims by squealing like a pig and wielding a massive-""bone cruncher"" cleaver. Lester can be quite menacing at times as well. Of course these characters wouldn't have been so great, without the amazing performances of Joe B. Barton  and Don Barrett. Everybody else all give decent performances as well. The film has an awesome soundtrack as well. Slaughterhouse is an amazingly fun ride.

Fun Facts- Joe Barton (dressed as Buddy) met with Ronald Reagan.

In 1988 The Director Rick Roessler Created Slaughterhouse II A Unproduced sequel that never got past the script and never released (such a shame I would've loved to see Buddy again).

Final thoughts- A must see for slasher fans.

1057709,5,6305663068,"Slaughterhouse (1987) is a great low budget horror movie, a bit of an unknown gem. This movie was released by American Artists and was written & directed by Rick Roessler; it is rated R (a ""hard R,"" in fact, due to the graphic violence) and is categorized as either Horror or Comedy/Horror, either are appropriate. The star of this movie is the killer, Buddy Bacon (Joe Barton). A 350 lb. murderous pig-like man who is intellectually deficient and has what his father refers to as ""basic hygiene problems."" Buddy's weapon of choice is an oversized ""bone cruncher"" meat cleaver, decorated with a mummified pig's foot and a hanging cow bell. His father, the disgruntled and mentally ill Lester Bacon (Don Barrett), owns the long defunct Bacon & Sons slaughterhouse. He is being pressured to sell the property by the sheriff, a lawyer, and a former partner, so that a new modern slaughterhouse could be built. The cast of characters also includes an adulterous deputy & his mistress, and six fun-loving teens, one of whom is the sheriff's daughter (Sherry Leigh), who wants to shoot a horror video in the ""abandoned"" slaughterhouse. The body count piles up until the final bloodbath on a dark & stormy night.
Slaughterhouse is a fun kind of horror movie, with a lot of colorful and original scenes. The opening title sequence is real footage from a pig slaughterhouse set to corny stock music. There is a humorous scene of Buddy taking a dangerous joy ride in a police car after donning the butchered law enforcement officer's bloody uniform. Some of the content is pure '80s cheese, including two music video scenes. The killing scenes are gory and inventive, such as Buddy crushing a man's head between his hands, and a man being ground up after being pushed into the trench of an an industrial waste disposal machine.
We are really caught unaware of the low budget of this movie, and that is something else unique. The physical features of the main location, including the grounds where the slaughterhouse stand (in reality a former produce packing plant) are expansive and varied; I agree with writer/producer Rick Roessler, who stated, ""we couldn't have found a better site anywhere."" There were even live pigs being kept there, who were used in the movie. Joe Barton (who plays Buddy) was an actual pig farmer from Missouri, and worked as the film's pig wrangler as well. There are several scenes of Buddy Bacon affectionately petting his pet pigs.
Slaughterhouse joins ranks with many other horror movies, such as The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Mother's Day (1980), Junior (1985), and House of 1000 Corpses (2003), in having a plot & story with many common elements with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). This film seemed to launch a subgenre of horror movies after its debut, itself drawing heavily from the 1932 Boris Karloff movie The Old Dark House. Slaughterhouse remains a solid film, fast paced and without any glaring flaws. I would recommend Slaughterhouse to anyone who likes their horror movies fun & bloody.
This is also one of the very best dvd presentations I have seen, with lots of interviews, additional footage, and extras; truly unexpected.",1412553600,4,3163,4.902985074626866

1057714,2,6305663068,"God have mercy!

 Buddy and his father Lester own a pig slaughtering house they're desperate to hold onto. The bank and some police in the small town are stupid enough to inform them there's nothing they can do to save their land. Throw in some stupid teens and you get a large pot of gory soup with some chopped body parts and hideous acting.

 Slaughterhouse is a horribly acted and scripted movie that makes one grimace in disgust. The story focuses on two villians - a father and son team - who own a slaughterhouse and are trying not to lose it. When the time comes that it is inevitable for them to do so, they choose to take their revenge. While some of the kills are disturbing overall this isn't one that impresses itself on a horror-lover's brain.

 The movie shoots from different angles. The main teenage girls life with parents and friends, then the father and Buddy at the slaughterhouse to a miscellaneous victim here and there. It wraps up with the teens deciding to go to what they think is an abandoned house on a dare -- where they meet up with the worst fate possible. Theyre trying to film -- you guessed it. A horror flick. The main victims in this straight-out slasher flick is a group of teens and some unlucky men from the bank. We also get to see a deputy and his main squeeze bite the big one. While the story doesn't lapse on the gore and violence there isn't much else.

 The father Lesters' character is uneven but he plays the part well. His obvious pathology is a little eerie. The teens are typical cardboard cut-outs who couldn't act if their lives depended on it. Nothing too special in the looks department either. I don't remember if there is nudity in this film or not.

 Buddy himself is gross -- in a negative and nauseating sort of way. The man eats canned dog food and grunts like a pig for crying out loud! He is the kind of beefy, sweaty, hairy man you hope to never end up sitting across from on a blind date.

 The film begins in a depressing way (pigs being sent to the slaughter) and has an unhappy ending.

 Save the money and don't rent this one. Rent another fun mindless slasher flick like a Friday or possibly even the Mutilator. Some slashers you rent for fun kills and gore only but this one doesn't make it.",1379635200,,2263,4.369928400954654

It is not much gory, apart from an amputation, but some murders are very raw then this is not a problem in fact the movie plays much more like a dark comedy than a horror.

In no way is this a tcm ripoff,why is it that if any movie has even a small family that kills people it automatically rips off tcm?

7892717,4,6305663068,"Yet another slasher film from the eighties saved by the folks at Vinegar Syndrome. Theyre becoming one of the go to companies when it comes to maintaining and rescuing movies that might not have been as mainstream as some would like but that deserve to be preserved. This is a perfect example of that.

SLAUGHTERHOUSE tells the story of Lester Bacon, the owner of an old slaughterhouse thats seen better days and his illiterate son Buddy. It seems that an ex-employee of Lesters has improved on slaughterhouse techniques and can handle more cattle than Lester ever could in a day. Now he wants to buy up Lesters old place to tear it down. Helping him accomplish this is Lesters lawyer and supposed friend while the local Sheriff is brought in to move things along.

Lester has other plans in mind though. They involve making these individuals pay for their treachery by having Buddy take them out one by one. The big brutish Buddy has no problem following the instructions of his father, especially since he learned well how to handle slaughtering animals back in the day. He even retains his own long handled cleaver which there is little doubt he will eventually use.

While all of this is unfolding there is also the story of the local teens looking for a place to hang out, drink and fool around. This is an eighties slasher flick after all. Thinking the old slaughterhouse is abandoned they present a dare to two of the girls in the group, walking through the old place. Of course they intend to scare them never realizing Buddy is walking around the same location. The fact that one of these girls is the daughter of the Sheriff just makes her all that more presentable as a victim.

Honestly there isn't much more to the story than that. But it doesnt matter because its enough to set up the situation and to deliver a character like Buddy the opportunity to slice, dice and spill buckets of blood. Perhaps the only problem with Buddy here is that hes supposed to be this tremendously ominous killer but comes off as a sympathetic character at times because of his mental health issues. It doesnt stop him from chopping away but it may have been what made this movie a single entry rather than a series of films.

The movie did find a VHS release on a fairly obscure label and later was released on DVD as well. Those copies weren't all that great though. Leave it to Vinegar Syndrome to give this movie the full special treatment. To begin with the movie looks better than ever with a new 2k scan. The extras included are plentiful. They include: a commentary track with Director Rick Roessler, Producer Jerry Encoe & Production Designer Michael Scaglione: a new video interview with Lead Actress Sherry Bendorf Leigh;
""Making a Low Budget Indie"" - Featurette with Rick Roessler; ""Producing Slaughterhouse"" - Interview with Jerry Encoe; archival interviews with Rick Roessler & Jerry Encoe; ""Epilogue: 30 Years After the Slaughter""; a radio interview featurette from 1987; local news coverage from the theatrical premiere; a behind the scenes featurette; outtakes; ""No Smoking"" SLAUGHTERHOUSE snipe; multiple theatrical trailers, tv & radio spots; shooting script gallery; and reversible cover artwork. Hows that for more bang for your buck.

There is a cult following for this film like many of the overlooked slasher films from the 80s and 90s. These movies may not be Oscar worthy material but they are deserving of preservation and viewing. Fans now have access to it not because some huge corporation decided there was money to be made but by a smaller company showing that there is an interest and that because of that a quality offering of movies like these are worth investing in. Kudos to Vinegar Syndrome for bringing back another forgotten treasure.",1501200000,,3768,4.807098765432099

Vinegar Syndrome has done a nice job of putting together this Blu Ray version complete with TONS of extras (old and NEW).  If you're a fan of this film there's no doubt you have to own this release and if you're a fan of the 80's slasher era and like a little bit more characterization than usual, you should give this flick a shot.  Some GREAT characters here!  The video quality is a little bit soft, but that's how it always looked. It's just more noticeable now in HD.  I'd rate the video quality at about a 3.5 out of 5 and the extras get a 5 out of 5 for being fun and plentiful!",1490745600,3,691,4.126865671641791
7892721,5,6305663068,"Wow!  Vinegar Syndrome has done an amazing job with the picture and sound quality of this 2 disc Blu-ray / DVD release. I really think Slaughterhouse fans will be blown away with what they see and hear. The newly scanned 2k restoration in my opinion is truly incredible. Images are crisp and clear and the level of detail is outstanding to say the least. Ive never seen this film look so good. Colors are solid and vibrant throughout the film. Blood and gore detail is well presented. I really couldn't find anything wrong with the picture, even the smallest details stand out.

As for the sound quality. Vinegar Syndrome presents Slaughterhouse with its original ultra-stereo mix for the very first time on home video. The 5.1 DTS HD sound comes through loud and clear and its clean and crisp throughout the film. Whether you're listening to Buddys grunting and groaning or the squealing of pigs, you really hear everything the dialogue has to offer. The films sound effects and score really shine and Ive never heard this movie sound so good. Vinegar Syndrome really has to be commended on this fantastic Blu-ray / DVD release.

Bacon and sons slaughterhouse has been defunct and dilapidated for years and is now facing foreclosure. Another local slaughterhouse has plans for Lester Bacons land.

I have the import and would consider this upgrade, but not at this price.  The Slaughterhouse isn't the ONLY thing that is going to be in Fnancial trouble if we keep getting hit with these prices.  This movie is pretty crazy and I like it, all but the opening credits of the real slaughterhouse footage.  I really wish that people making films never used footage like that - depressing and sad.  But once that is over, the film is pretty great!",1484006400,,564,4.314285714285714

Mr. Les Bacon compromises his freedom of commerce by going along with government regulations for the pittance that government subsidies will always makeup for the intrusion into his business. But once the subsidies are withheld his business goes under due to the overbearing regulations that linger. Finally the insanity of it all leaves Mr. Les Bacon a broken man. Fortunately, another butcher's business survives by passing the cost of the burden of the government on to its consumers.",1480636800,,541,5.3023255813953485
