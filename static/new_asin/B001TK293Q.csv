8341715,4,B001TK293Q,"This is a great taste of canoeing on the rivers in southern WI.  I say taste because in order to really give you a guide to the WI rivers this set should be a 10+ DVD set.  Regardless, for a displaced cheesehead this is a wonderful taste of home.  The video quality is excellent, the river footage is well thought out by people who love the rivers, but the actors/presenters are acceptable.  There is also a second video on northern Illinois, but I am hoping there is a third video on the rivers in northern WI.",1300233600,,511,4.291666666666667
8341716,4,B001TK293Q,"There are two 1 hour DVDs in this item, for streams in Eastern and Western South Wiscosin.  Overall it was well done and does its job of showing the viewer what these streams look like.  Video and picture quality was good.  If I may make any criticism, and this is a minor issue, they may have wanted to get a better voice for the narration.  There are usually a bunch of canoes floating down the river at once.  Overall well done.",1298764800,,431,4.271604938271605
