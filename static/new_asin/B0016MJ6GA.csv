3161071,3,B0016MJ6GA,"If you've never brushed up against fanboy or comic book culture this might leave you cold - a case study of arrested development in groups. Perhaps you've been among the true believers, though, like the ones who exchange wedding vows in Klingon. Then the stereotypes will all look very familiar. I swear, Hutch looks just like the guy behind the counter at the comic shop downtown.

This has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of James T. Kirk's home town. That fan-built statue is a hoot, when you look at just how much cod there is in the codpiece. A few in-jokes helped too, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THX1138/dp/6300269329/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THX1138</a>-style guards' masks, or the Shatner cameo. Heartwarming moments didn't warm me, though, and one-joke movies wear thin fast. I'm glad I saw this once, but wouldn't be happy seeing it twice.

3161072,5,B0016MJ6GA,This movie was hilarious. I was only able to see it 4 times in the theater as it wasn't around long. I just hope it doesn't take so long to get the dvd! One of my favorite scenes was when the boys needed to be rescued by their fanfriend.  The sound effects were from the real thing.,1238025600,4,282,3.9473684210526314
3161073,4,B0016MJ6GA,"1998, and every ""Star Wars"" fan was abuzz. Episode 1 was finally coming out. No, Episode 1 did not come out in 1977. That first film was really Episode 4.

Fans were camping out at movie theatres in anticipation of tickets going on sale. ""Fanboys"" is the story of four friends who realize that one of them will not be there for the opening.  Linus (Chris Marquette) has cancer and they really want him to see ""The Phantom Menace."" Their idea:  break into Skywalker Ranch and see the first cuts.

Eric (Sam Huntington) isn't quite on the page yet.  He's abandoned the dream of creating a comic book and  literally sold out, selling cars at his Dad's dealership.  He hasn't seen Linus in years and doesn't even realize his best friend has cancer.

Hutch (Dan Fogler) despite still living in his Mom's 'carriage house' is a pretty good persuader. And Windows (Jay Baruchel) has found an online girlfriend ""Rogue Leader"" who will help them with plans, etc. for Skywalker Ranch.

Still, they manage to get on the road and what a long strange trip it is from Ohio to California.  We've got cameo appearances by William Shatner, Billy D. Williams, and Carrie Fisher.

This is a film for every fan who's stood out in the rain in line or played cards on the floor of a theatre waiting for tickets.  The only thing serious about this film is the fun and it's definitely worth full price to see it.

3161074,5,B0016MJ6GA,"This is a movie that is not to be missed! This movie may not be for everyone, but for the millions of Star Wars lovers worldwide, this movie will rocks your sides off!  The producers have taken a cast of some of the wackiest and most talented young comics of the day and pared them with a storyline that makes me want to laugh just to think of it!

A bunch of long-time friends who are die-hard Star Wars fans decide to drive cross-country on a ""quest"" to break into George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and steal a copy of the Phantom Menace.  It takes a special brand of insanity to pull off a trip like this, but these guys are motivated!

Sit back, relax and get ready for the road trip of your life!",1235779200,,697,4.17910447761194
3161075,2,B0016MJ6GA,"The premise of ""Fanboys"": In 1998, a group of diehard ""Star Wars"" fanatics decide to drive to Marin County, California, break into Skywalker Ranch, steal an early print of ""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,"" and see it before general release the following year. Even within the context of a goofy comedy, this idea could not be any less plausible. It hints at satire, but it never goes any further than that because, in order for satire to work, you actually have to be making fun of something. ""Fanboys"" is not constructed like that; it glorifies extreme fandom, as if it were something to be proud of. It regards four socially inept people as heroes. Acts of stupidity are treated not as warnings against that kind of behavior but as loving tributes to unwavering devotion.

So this begs the question: If this movie is so keen on exalting ""Star Wars"" super fans, why make it a comedy? Why have the characters look like complete idiots? Don't they deserve better than being depicted as nerdy stereotypes? I recall ""Trekkies,"" a fascinating documentary from 1997 that explored the ""Star Trek"" universe and the fans who inhabit it; that film is a much more tolerable example of how extreme fandom can be glorified, simply because it showed real people. Sure, some of them seemed very silly on camera, but at least they drew from what was actually within. They weren't just following along with a juvenile screenplay. Maybe ""Fanboys"" would have worked much better as a documentary about ""Star Wars"" fans.

The story focuses on four twenty-something ""Star Wars"" fans from Ohio. Eric (Sam Huntington) works for his father (Christopher McDonald) at a car dealership. While Eric appears happy at the prospect of taking over the family business, his real passion is drawing comic books. So you might say that being offered his father's dealership is like being tempted by the dark side of the Force. Anyway, he finds out that his best friend, Linus (Christopher Marquette), has been diagnosed with cancer. Knowing that he might not live to see the release of ""The Phantom Menace,"" Eric decides to take Linus on a road trip to Skywalker Ranch, where a rough cut of the prequel is ready and waiting to be stolen.

Along for the ride are two other friends. One is the spectacled Windows (Jay Baruchel), who hopes to meet the girl he's been chatting with online, the one who provided him with blueprints to Skywalker Ranch. The other is Hutch (Dan Fogler), who drives a black van decked out with various ""Star Wars"" accents, including an R2-D2 dome, a paintjob of the first film's poster, and a forbidden red button on the dashboard that can blast the engine into light speed. The only out-of-place touch: A collection of Rush albums, all on audiocassette tapes. Hutch runs a comic book store and still lives in his mother's garage. He calls it a carriage house, which is about the same as calling a basement a subterranean chamber.

There comes a point when they're joined by Zoey (Kristen Bell), who, as far as Windows is concerned, represents a paradox: She's a beautiful young woman, and yet she's a ""Star Wars"" fan. Just as paradoxical is the fact that she's beautiful and has a crush on Windows. It seems he's allowed to lust after beautiful girls, but beautiful girls aren't allowed to like him for who he is.

As they travel, they make a couple of interesting pit stops, the first being a town in Iowa where fanatical ""Star Trek"" enthusiasts gather at a statue of James Kirk and Khan (neither of which bear a likeness to the actors who played them). This paves the way for one of the films worst scenes, in which our four friends get into a brutal fight with a group of people dressed in Starfleet uniforms. This plays into the fact that there's a blood feud between fans of the franchises, which only further demonstrates the depth to which fandom can sink. If you have to duke it out with someone for not liking something you like, you're taking your passion far too seriously. It's one thing to be a fan of something. It's quite another thing to let devotion consume your life.

The real problem here is that ""Fanboys"" is like a spoof that forgot to make fun of what it was spoofing. The characters have personality quirks that are inherently funny, yet we can't laugh at them because they're treated as heroes, not as comedy relief. The only hint of true satire comes in the form of cameo appearances, and even then it doesn't work because the actors are not given anything important to do. Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith, and Jason Mewes show up at certain points, as do ""Star Wars"" alumni Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and Ray Park (a.k.a., the guy who played Darth Maul). One cameo I won't reveal is a source that goes by the code name Scruffy Nerf-Herder.

What I find absolutely amazing is that George Lucas approved of this film. Did he not realize that it was anything but a tribute to ""Star Wars"" and its fans? If anything, it's a painfully unfunny look at how fandom can spin out of control. Its unfocused structure is second only to the tumultuous history of the film's release, which was delayed as far back as August of 2007 due to reshoots and a disagreement over the cancer subplot. Test audiences apparently preferred to leave it in, although I'm not sure why since it clashes with the film's overall goofball tone. There's a moment between Eric and Linus that's so shamelessly sentimental, it's as if the filmmakers forgot that ""Fanboys"" was intended to be a comedy. You can't believably create a tender moment after nearly ninety minutes of sophomoric gags.",1234396800,9,5581,4.712090163934426
3161076,5,B0016MJ6GA,"Okay, it's finally happened ... there is an official release date for the theatrical release of Fanboys!!!  On September 29th of 2008 the movie will be in limited release across the country.  Still no report of how limited the release will be, whether 1,000 theaters or 1 theater (knowing Weinstein/Darth Vader, it will probably be 1), but the sooner it hits theaters, the sooner it will come available on DVD.

This should've been released on DVD a LOOONNNNGGGG Time ago..... in THIS Galaxy, not one far, far away.  What's worse, there's Still no ""to be released on"" date!  I didn't get the opportunity to see it the theatres; but heard great things -- and have been anxiously awaiting it's DVD release ever since; but the way things are going, I'll either be William Shatner's age before it's released.... or Star Wars will have a whole new Trilogy (either parts 7-9, or 3 Prequels to Episode I)!!  (not that 3 new Star Wars episodes wouldn't be cool as hell)  Anyway, someone please enlighten me -- I've never heard of a Movie having this much a lag between Theater Release & DVD Release!  Only precedent that comes close to this, was the BSG Season 3 box set -- but that was delayed for TV related problems... problems which Movies don't have. (????)

Since this was finally released, figured I should come back & give an *actual* review, haha.  okay.... 1st off, I'm not a big ""comedy"" guy... I usually just rent them; & own less than a dozen (half of which are Kevin Smith movies!).  Anyway, this movie is AWESOME & I'm so glad it Finally came out.  I've watched it several times now (I do own it), & it's AS Funny each & every time... which is a rare thing in Comedies (which again, is why I typically don't bother buying them).  I'll never understand why it took so long, or why it never hit theaters... it would've been a HUGE success Theatrically; but whatever.  You should definitely buy this movie... you will not regret it!  Absolutely the BEST (non Kevin Smith) Comedy that I've seen in YEARS!",1213574400,3,1703,4.526143790849673

Along the way they tangle with Trek fans and get into the usual scrapes you'd expect from a road movie, albeit with a distinctively geekish spin. There are some terrific cameos (some of which are just a pure delight to see) but much of the movie's charm comes from the sheer unabashed cameraderie of the central characters.

This film is similar in tone in a lot of ways to Kevin Smiths movies, but a significantly different variation.  I felt the acting, story, film making and humor were all  strong.  None of the elements was too drawn out or annoying.  The cameos were excellent.  The allusions to other movies were clever.  I really like the characters.

Some if the movie also takes place in one of Albuquerque's local comic book stores.

3161432,5,B0016MJ6GA,"I see a few reviews here giving this movie 2 stars because it's a nerd movie.

I'm giving it 5 stars BECAUSE IT'S A NERD MOVIE!!!

I'm a Star Wars geek. (I'm also a Star Trek geek, so the banter between the two fan bases in this movie was hysterical to me.)

There are so many sci-fi references in this movie that it's hard to keep up. And they are worked in seemlessly into the story.

The story itself is your basic road comedy. A bunch of friends have to take a road trip to break into George Lucas' house. (You know, because sometimes the need for that just happens! We've all been there...). It's the same kind of advanture as National Lampoon's Vacation. A bunch of stuff goes wrong and they have to overcome it to get to the destination. On in this case instead of getting help from Cousin Eddie, they get their help from William Shatner. (Oh yeah...Captain Kirk makes an appearence. It's fantastic.)

It's funny. It's sweet (the friends overcome their own internal struggles and bond). And its' nerdy.

If you are a sci-fi fan you have to see this movie. Have to.

Also it takes some pot shots at how bad The Phantom Menace was. And there is always room for that.",1398211200,2,1171,4.368663594470046

The main characters are hysterical in their own rights due to both the character designs and the performances of the individual actors/actresses (actress is very important).  Homages to Star Wars are peppered throughout the entire movie, some discretely and others not at all.  However, I must have watched this movie 20+ times and I still find little things that I had never previously noticed each and every time I watch it.  Finally, and most importantly, even if the 95% of this movie was terrible (which is not the case), the remaining 5% contains Kristen Bell in a Slave Leia costume which alone is well worth the price of the movie.",1392854400,3,694,4.710743801652892

3161463,2,B0016MJ6GA,"When buying this flm I assumed too much and as result I was as cruelly disappointed as Darth Vader when Luke, Leia & Co escaped from the Cloud City. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of a group of friends, Eric (Sam Huntington), Hutch (Dan Fogler), Linus (Chris Marquette), Windows (Jay Baruchel) and Zoe (Kristen Bell) who are obsessive Star Wars fans (well, Zoe is maybe just a little bit more reasonable than the boys). They are very excited that a new Star Wars movie (The Phantom Menace) will open in six months - but then they learn that Linus has terminal stage cancer and there is no way he will live that long. So they immediately decide to go on a quest - drive to Texas, break into Skywalker ranch and steal one copy of the film, so Linus can see it before dying. This film describes this noble (and completely crazy) quest.

Before going further, for sake of full disclosure I must confess something. Yes, I am totally a Star Wars fanboy, quite a desperate case in fact - and proud of being one too! That being said, I actually love Star Wars spoofs and parodies (""Spaceballs"", ""Robot Chicken"", ""How it should have ended"", etc.) as well as all the jokes about fanboys. For some reason even being the butt of such jokes from those who never saw the light (or at least the dark side of the Force) never bothered me - to the contrary I always was and still am the first to have a merry good laugh about it. All of this was the reason why I expected so much from this film - but my disappointment was cruel...

I started to have a bad feeling about this movie already after the first minute. Four minutes later I realised that those were not the droids I was looking for. After 10 minutes I yelled ""It's a trap""! After 20 minutes my count of midi-chlorians reached zero. In the middle of the film I started looking for death sticks. After one hour I felt like complete ""bantha pudu"". After 75 minutes I started calling aloud for a wookie to come and rip my hands of. And towards the end I reached the state of such ultimate mental degradation that - I still cannot believe I am writing it - I had a craving for an appearance by Jar-Jar Binks...

So what went wrong? Well, let me count the ways:

1) This film is mostly not funny. At all. Most of jokes are really lame.

2) Being unable to make good jokes, the director decided to replace them by a lot of VULGARITY. It was a bad decision.

3) The characters are not really likeable and in particular Hutch is simply DISGUSTING. The one exception is Zoe, the only girl in the group - but her character is mostly put on the second plan. I also had some sympathy for Linus, for quite obvious reasons...

4) For all the reasons cited above this not very long film is also by moments quite boring and annoying.

That being said, there are some good scenes. Not many of them, but still:

- the trip to ""enemy territory"" (Iowa) and the confrontation ""fanboys vs. trekkies"" is quite good - but it lasts a grand total of five minutes

- there is a good gag about the cultural difference between Iowa and California, but it takes like 30 seconds in all, divided in two parts

- the meeting with ""The Chief"" (Danny Trejo) is also a good scene (but NOT the scenes which precede it!); but it lasts like two minutes tops...

- the cameos by Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and William Shatner (!) are very good - but each of them lasts less than one minute...

- at the very end Kristen Bell appears for a moment wearing Leia's Golden Bikini; for obvious reasons it is my favourite scene...

- then there is finally the last line said in the film, and that actually is a quite good conclusion - but it is a 5 seconds scene...

Considering however that this film lasts 90 minutes, all above is not enough. The good moments of this film are like 20 000 Republic dataries on Tatooine - not nearly enough to give you satisfaction...

Bottom line, this film is sadly mostly a failure. Which is really, but really a pity, because the initial idea was really great...",1389225600,4,4050,4.3572377158034525

What can I say, it's probably every fanboy's dream to experience what the Fanboy boys (and one girl) went through.

The movie is not all nerdism and there are some mildly sentimental scenes that get a bit ""Bromance-ish"", but it all adds to the determination placed on these guys.  What I really liked about this movie is the well thought out offensive humor lines.  There is some crude humor involved but not to the point where you find yourself short 10 IQ points.  The wardrobes are to die for and I seriously cringed towards the end when all the prop-replicas came out.  Overall, this movie is a great time to be enjoyed by yourself or with friends.

Is this a keeper?  YES!!

Would I watch it again?  YES!!

3161571,4,B0016MJ6GA,"If I can boil it down to one reason - one reason why you should watch Fanboys - it has to be this: Kristen Bell looks mighty fine in her skimpy Slave Leia outfit. There's also that if you've a love or fascination for the Star Wars franchise, well, sir, this film is an unabashed love letter. The screenplay is by Ernest Cline who wrote the amazing sci-fi thriller Ready Player One, and Ernest Cline is like the idiot savant of pop culture references, except minus the idiot part. Even Joss Whedon says, ""Hot damn, this guy's crafty!""

Fanboys takes us back to an infamous era, back to when George Lucas could do no wrong and Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace had yet to be released and nerds all around were clammy with anticipation. On October 31, 1998, in Ohio, four childhood pals with a shared obsession for all things Star Wars unexpectedly reconnect at a Halloween bash. One thing leads to another, nerd passions are rekindled - and factor in, also, that one of the dudes is dying of cancer - and the quartet soon embark on a cross-country trek to infiltrate George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and steal away with a rough cut print of Episode One months before its official release.

As odysseys go, this one's fairly uneventful, that is, if you disregard the po-po and getting thrown in the clink and those angry, vindictive Trekkies and that one incensed p! mp and that pretty messed-up g@y bar. Fanboys is a boisterous coming-of-age story, yessir, and it says stuff about friendship and loyalty and eventually putting away those childish things but maybe holding off on that for just a tiny bit longer. Fanboys is also raunchy and funny and there's a lot of Rush being played (not at all an awful thing). There met be nerd-on-nerd violence as our four Star Wars hardcases tangle with a crew of Star Trek maniacs. We also learn that there may not be much of a difference between a garage and a carriage house.

Do the four chums stay the course and accomplish their far-fetched mission? I won't say. I will say that the surprise cameos are pretty sweet, although I'll defer from dropping any names. And while the gags and jokes regarding the source material seem to be genuinely affectionate in tone, there are those occasional snide remarks that let us know the filmmakers are well aware of the fallout to this second batch of Star Wars films. When the friends are finally poised to view Episode One, one guy turns to another and, in a slightly panicked voice, asks the unthinkable: ""What if it sucks?"" That kid must've been prescient. Lastly and again, Kristen Bell is so hot in that Slave Leia outfit, my lightsaber went ""Hhrrrmmm!"" I also got a b0ner.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Audio Commentary with director Kyle Newman, writers Ernie Cline and Adam F. Goldberg, and actors Dan Fogler, Kristen Bell, and Sam Huntington
- 6 Deleted Scenes (totals 00:07:50 minutes and includes a funny extended scene with Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes)
- ""Disturbances in the Force"" - a series of 7 webisodes that takes you behind the scenes of Fanboys (totals 00:11:40 minutes and worth it just to see Kristen Bell do the Sprite commercial rap)
- ""The Truth about Fanboys"" - director and cast attempt to define what a fanboy is (00:05:49 minutes)
- ""The Star Wars Parallel""  - a few of the film's Star Wars references are mentioned (00:05:19 minutes)
- ""4 Fanboys and 1 Fangirl"" - the principal cast members talk up the characters they play (00:08:50 minutes)

I'm a huge Star Wars nerd and I can honestly say there were almost no funny moments in this movie.  The whole thing feels like a movie not made by fans of Star Wars, but by people who perhaps met a Star Wars fan in passing somewhere.

I swear, Hutch looks just like the guy behind the counter at the comic shop downtown.

This has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of James T. Kirk's home town. That fan-built statue is a hoot, when you look at just how much cod there is in the codpiece. A few in-jokes helped too, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THX-1138/dp/B000P3GFWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THX 1138</a>-style guards' masks, or the Shatner cameo.

It sounds like an idea that maybe a group of eight year olds would come doesn't it. That is if they could drive. Unfortunately this hair-brained plan is devised by 5 lifelong sci-fi, comic book fans who happened to be old enough to drive and stupid enough to attempt to do it. As the road unfolds before them, along with an endless series of insane encounters and unpredictable mishaps they experience along the way, their road trip begins to evolve into an epic quest for redemption and an unforgettable rite of passage that none will ever forget.

Critique: I didn't expect much from this film. I wasn't looking forward to wasting my time watching another dime a dozen crazy teenage road trip, low brow humor film. Well..., I was wrong. `Fanboy' is a well thought out, clever, immensely funny film is not only enjoyable on the initial viewing but will stand up well to the repeatability factor.

3161602,5,B0016MJ6GA,"First and foremost, this film features and outstanding young cast: Sam Huntingon (Not Another Teen Movie), Chris Marquette (hilarious in The Girl Next Door), Jay Baruchel (funny and awkward as ever), Kristen Bell (gorgeous and talented as always), and Seth Rogan (whose mannerisms always seem to be funny).  Who stole the show, however, was relatively obscure Dan Fogler.  Part Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, part Jack Black without the tendency to irritate, Fogler absolutely stole every scene into which his hairy, obese body waddled (Do a Google picture search for ""awesome none left"" and you get a good idea of what he looks like).

Beyond the superbly blended cast is a heart-warming yet laugh out loud story of a group of twenty-something friends who have wanted one thing for years: to break into George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch and steal a copy of Phantom Menace before its release.  Anyone in the sci-fi community can tell you that this release was HIGHLY anticipated, and executing this plan would have been akin to an Arthurian knight finding the Holy Grail.  Watching the crew band together and embark on this perilous mission reminds me of, oh, I don't know, the crew from Star Wars - minus the midget they should have had for Yoda - perhaps?  Although, it's a bit of a stretch to paint Kristen Bell as an obsessive Star Wars, sci-fi fan who dresses up as Leia and waits in line for the premiere of Phantom Menace; there can only be a handful of girls like that in the world.

For Star Wars and Star Trek fans (i.e. Trekkies or Trekkers, choose one), this movie is saturated with references, superb cameos, trivia, and enough ""insider"" moments to impress the true fanboys.  If you waited in line to see the Phantom Menace and you haven't seen this, you're doing yourself a big disservice (they debate the inherently incestuous relationship between Luke and Leia).  If you're just a random sci-fi fan and you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it.  Even average movie fans should laugh enough to make this enjoyable.

It's basically the story of a group of friends who go on a road trip to steal a copy of Star Wars Episode 1 from George Lucas before it's released. I didn't find myself laughing out loud too much throughout movie... but I did have a smile on my face through most of it. There's a lot of cool cameos, and of course as would be expected in a movie like this a ton of geeky Star Wars (and Star Trek) jokes and references.

I think the reason this one never elevates itself above an average comedy, is that there are way too many overused and cliche plot devices and comedic elements... to the point where it feels a little disingenuous at times. But let's be honest... I'm probably being a little too critical of a movie that wasn't meant to be analyzed, its meant to turn your brain off and enjoy; and that being said I'd say it did its job in that respect.

The movie follows the story of a group of 5 friends. 4 boys 1 girl. One of which is battling cancer and is going to die before The Phantom Menace is released. So the fanboys go on a journey to Lucasranch to steal a copy of TPM so that Linus (the one with cancer) will be able to see it before he dies.

Sure, you will probably laugh a few times, but there are few memorable moments that have not been seen in other comedies in the last ten years.  This movie will choke you with terrible Star Wars references, but try as it might; an obscure reference does not a funny movie make.  I would guess that if you like Dane Cook and Star Wars, you would probably like this movie (yes, Dane Cook is not funny either, he just yells and reminds you of things you have seen before).  There are some good cameos by Billy D. Williams, Carrie Fischer, William Shatner and that guy who played Darth Maul from that movie no one cares about.  The fat kid from Balls of Fury is not funny.  He really wants to be a bad ass in this movie, but I can't accept it.

The Lucas fanboy references are really fun from the sound effects to the android policemen from THX and the cameos were great, particularly from Seth Rogen, Shatner and Danny McBride.  The problem is that the leads aren't very interesting other than the ones played by Baruchel and Fogler who really give it their all.  A cancer plotline is mentioned, but comes in and out and anyone who has been around cancer will find the movie more than a little insulting with the brevity with which its handled.

But I was also surprised that it covered the underground hostility that Trekkies and Starwoids show towards each other.  It is always funny to me (being a reseller) that Trekkies will not buy Star Trek stuff if it is next to Star Wars stuff and vice versa.  So the scene in the film where some trekkies go into the (Windows?) comic book store and want to know the price of a Star Trek Phaser, really hit home with me.

There are tons of other great scenes that also caught my eye , but I do not want to spoil it.  Other unique quality of this film is the huge amount of cameos this show has -- such as William Shatner and Carrie Fisher.

Story revolves around a group of friends who really aren't going anywhere.... where Eric (Sam Huntington) feels his life needs direction, as he listlessly works at his father's used car lot, even though his true passion is art, and creating his own comic book, something he put off thinking it was all pipe dreams. Then there are his friends, best friend Linus (Chris Marquette), nerd o'rama Windows (Jay Baruchel), and crazy man, Hutch (Dan Fogler) who has pimped out his van as if it is the Millennium Falcon, and nerd cutie Zoe (Kirsten Bell). These guys live and breath anything fanboy, whether it's arguing who fired first... Han or Greedo, which is better Empire or Jedi, arguing if Boba fett is a genuine bad ass or not, and basically repeating their favorite movie lines in everyday lingo (seriously who doesn't do that? my friends and I do it) anyways turns out Linus finds he has a terminal illness where he and Eric have drifted apart after high school, where Eric thinks what his friends do are childish games, that they never grew up, thinking he is the only one who really moved on from this nonsense, where as with the rest of the group it's a passion something they enjoy, like outdoor enthusiasts enjoying the outdoors, dog lovers that will do anything for an animal, people who collect garden gnomes, it's something they enjoy. Linus knows he will not see Star Wars Episode I, so when Eric realizes this he hatches a plan to go to Skywalker Ranch to steal a copy with the group. On the outside it's a buddy road trip movie, with it comes the hilarity, but deep down it wasn't about stealing one of the most anticipated movies to hit 1999, it's about knowing who your true friends are and spending one last adventure before it's too late, where Eric doesn't realize this until I think mid way through. Each of the characters find out who they are, and they too can follow their dreams no matter how big or ridiculous, Windows finally see Zoe for who she is not just a best friend but deep down actually loves her, it's reciprocal, and Hutch follows his dreams of opening an Automotive Detailing Business.

Anyways hilarity ensues when they stop in Iowa the birth place of one James Tiberius Kirk, and Hutch gets into a fight with a bunch of Trekkies, one played by Seth Rogen, who also plays a pimp in Vegas. And when they do reach Skywalker ranch they run into some very animated Security Guards played by Will Arnett, and Craig Robinson. With More cameos by Shatner, Carrie Fischer, Billy Dee Williams, Kevin Smith.

This film is funny, and heartwarming (kind of odd for this type, some will argue it should of been a straight up comedy/ road trip movie, why the downer of having a character with a Terminal Illness and all, it still worked in my opinion)....

It is really too bad that the film didn't have a bigger theater release, as it would be alot of fun to be in a theater with other Star War fans.

3161628,2,B0016MJ6GA,"This might come off rather odd but this film makes me regret being a sci-fi fan in some ways, more so in my liking of the Star Wars franchise. The problem with this film isn't the story, the story itself is actually not to bad. The problem comes from the characters and the truly awful script.

The character's are pretty generic for a ""geek"" comedy. You have your normal guy, your over-the-edge geek insecure guy, your hot babe, your over-the-edge geek funny guy, etc. It's a safe cast, but definitely not memorable, because they are so generic. Each character viewed separately seem to be the right fit for the movie, but when they are all put together, they seem to not work to well together. As you watch the movie, it feels like each character bounces off of each other instead of having a free flowing dialog, which can make the movie a little irritating to watch (and listen to) at times.

As I had mentioned before, the story itself is not to bad. The story centered around the pre-release of Episode I when a group of Star Wars fans trying to break into Skywalker Ranch in order to steal a copy of Star Wars: Episode I for their dying friend who won't live long enough to see it in theaters when it is released. They run into quirky set backs along the way but basically you already know the ending result. As I had mentioned, it is not a bad story by far, but it is also not a very memorable one.

By far the worst part of this movie is the script. As you can imagine, a movie about Star Wars fans is going to be riddled with Star Wars one-liners. This movie is filled with those one-liners to the point of narcissism. No character can go one sentence without saying some kind of reference pertaining to Star Wars in some way. It's not to bad at the beginning, but when you hear these one-liners for about an hour, they start getting old REALLY FAST! The script starts loosing its touch and you start to cringe whenever you hear a Star Wars reference. Honestly, being a Star Wars fan myself since childhood, I started to seriously question myself if I sound like them, and I hoped to God Almighty that I didn't.

I can understand the attraction one might have in seeing this movie. Majority of our generation grew up watching Star Wars and have some sort of bond with the films, thus making us all 'FanBoys' to some degree, but do not feel any kind of duty to watch this film. This movie was not made 'for FanBoys', it was made by actors portraying to 'be FanBoys' to an obnoxious degree. It's not the worst movie you will ever see, but it more than likely will be one of the most irritating.",1261440000,4,2602,4.358762886597938
3161629,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I'd only had an inkling of the massive production quagmire that this movie went through [..], but when I finally saw the movie on DVD I was astonished that it wasn't promoted properly.  ""Fanboys"" barely cracked the 500,000 dollar mark, and it could have easily made a few million.

Now, it's not a great film, but it's a very enjoyable movie.  Granted, I had no expectations, but I was still very pleasantly surprised at how funny it was and how much I liked the characters.  As others have mentioned, it's not a deep meditation on the meaning of geekdom like ""High Fidelity"" or ""Galaxy Quest"", but it's lots of fun.

It does have a very slapdash quality to it, but what road movie doesn't?  I enjoyed the whole entire movie, but the closing line doubled my appreciation.  If you're a fan of the original films, but not of the new ones, you'll have fun.  Some beers wouldn't hurt!

As one of the three or four people who saw Fanboys in theaters I can assure you that it's a waste of money--with an almost complete dearth of laughs, fun, or anything that makes a movie enjoyable to watch, this film feels like direct to video fodder and should be avoided by everyone, fanboys and casual movie-watchers alike.

3161632,3,B0016MJ6GA,"disco es entretenido, pero al principio incluye una gran cantidad de remolques que sinceramente don `t like me. los que me aburren. Sin embargo, el panorama es tan divertido",1260835200,,173,5.0
3161633,5,B0016MJ6GA,"Don't listen to the critics on this one, Fanboys did exactly what it set out to do; it had its share of flaws, but in the end it's a fun, somewhat-vulgar, road trip romp full of geektastic in-jokes and more random cameos than a Kevin Smith movie (including Kevin himself).
Those familiar with the long, arduous production this movie had to deal with will know just how long we had to wait, and while I think the original cut (before 'Darth' Weinstein decided it wasn't mainstream enough and tried to butcher it before it was even finished) would have been a better movie, it still accomplishes it's simple goal.
Fanboys is the story of Eric, Linus, Hutch, and Windows, four of the most life-long, die-hard and dedicated Starwoids you've ever met. These are the nerds who drive around in an elaborately-tricked-out Star Wars van (Bucephalus), know literally every bit of Star Wars or geek-related trivia out there, and spend their free time playing the video games, reading the comics, watching and reenacting the movies and discussing the most seemingly-insignificant of Star Wars details more passionately than any presidential debate. For these guys, Star Wars is a way of life, and more importantly, the bond that has glued four incredibly different friends together for life... whether they like it or not.
Eric Bottler knows this all too well; see, three years ago, he decided that Dad was right and he needed to grow up and move on. So he got a job at his father's used car dealership and began climbing the ranks, letting his friends (and Star Wars) fall to the wayside. It's now 1999, six months to go until the release of the Phantom Menace, and Eric's betrayal of the Wars was especially hard on Linus, Eric's best friend, and partner-in-crime; not only had Linus and Eric planned for years to start their own comic book and become geektastic stars in their own right, but not long after Eric bails on them, he's diagnosed with cancer. And with his expiration date looming closer and closer, it's become apparent that Linus very well might be gone by the time the movie hits theaters. Still, he stubbornly refuses to even tell Eric about his illness, and Eric is still disgusted with his friends' immaturity. But the other half of the dynamic quad won't let them end things on this note. Hopelessly awkward Windows and fat, irritating Hutch take matters into their own hands, spilling Linus' secret and prompting an apologetic, deeply unhappy, and even deeper-in-denial Eric to suggest one crazy idea that's been festering in the back of all their minds since the fifth grade: road trip it to northern California, and break into Skywalker Ranch, this time to find an advanced copy of the new movie so Linus can see it before he dies.
The road trip follows the usual formula of random things happening in random places, with plenty of Star Wars twists, of course; Hutch takes the guys on a detour to Riverside, Iowa to mock Trekkies; Bucephalus breaks down and the boys are forced to brave a bar full of gay bikers in order to fix it; Windows meets his internet dreamgirl, only to find Rogue Leader isn't who she seems; they get arrested and bailed out by gal pal, Zoe; there's a hilarious incident with a pair of hookers and their pimp in Vegas, where our heroes once more run into Admiral Seascholz and his crew of ""Trekkers"".
Considering the miniscule budget the production had to work with (the movie would probably never have been made without random fans popping out of the woodwork and offering themselves for use as extras, or their stuff for set dressings), it's actually rather impressive. They also managed to gather a group of some of the most underrated twenty-something actors around. And who can forget the cameos; of the direct Star Wars camp, Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), and Ray Park (Darth Maul) all make an appearance. William Shatner shows up as the boys' Vegas contact, and Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News is given a send-up (Harry himself was unable to actually play himself in the movie). And Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) and a slew of others have a scene or two.
According to most of the critics, the gang's opinion of Phantom Menace should be the point of the movie (more importantly, the gang's negative opinion, because apparently no one is allowed to actually like it). If you're only watching for Episode One-bashing, don't bother; as Linus so directly puts it, ""this wasn't about the movie... this was about all of us."" And if you're there to mock the fanboy (or girl), you'll be disappointed as well. This is a celebration of the fanboy, and all that he (or she) stands for. On the other hand, it could be argued that it's not even really about Star Wars; it's about brotherhood; about never giving up on your dreams, or your friends; and never letting anyone tell you that you're too... whatever, for the stuff you love.
Thoroughly recommended, as long as you don't go into it expecting it to be more than what it is. Non-Starwoids might be a little lost, but don't let that scare you away; there's plenty of stupid, vulgar, non-geek humor, too (I'll let you decide if that's a good or bad thing).",1260489600,,5204,4.726072607260726
3161634,4,B0016MJ6GA,"But I was very surprised with how good ""Fanboys"" really turned out.  The film was mired in production difficulties, re-edits, storyline changes, etc. for many months and I expected it to be nothing more than a shell of the original idea by the time it hit the theaters and/or DVD shelf.  However, at its core, ""Fanboys"" manages to be a very funny (especially if you are a science fiction geek) nod to real fanboys with a decent amount of heart thrown in for good measure.

The story centers on four friends.  The somewhat estranged Bottler (Sam Huntington) has grown-up and become a responsible car salesman for his father despite dreaming of becoming a comic book artist.  The rest of the gang, however, are trapped in their own ""immature"" world of ""Star Wars,"" comic books and a general hatred of ""Star Trek"" fans.  The fanatical Hutch (Dan Fogler) runs a struggling comic book shop with Windows (Jay Baruchel), an uber-nerd who's socially awkward.  Chris Marquette fill out the group as Linus, who has recently found out that he has roughly four months to live.

Linus' cancer draws Bottler back into the group and they decide to break into Skywalker Ranch in order to steal a rough cut of the upcoming ""Episode I--The Phantom Menace"" so that Linus can see it before he dies.  What follows is an unevenly humorous adventure scattered with multiple inside jokes (some obvious, others not so much) pointed at Star Wars, Star Trek and science fiction in general as well as a number of cameos.

The best moments are those involving interactions with with Trek fans and the actual break in attempt at Skywalker Ranch.  The group finds themselves in jail while on their journey, and are bailed out by Zoe (Kristen Bell), a worker from Hutch's comic shop.  She joins them for the rest of their adventure and provides a much needed ""punky"" boost to the film.

All of the characters are mirrored from either characters or plotlines from the original ""Star Wars"" films.  Much like the inside jokes, some of these parallels are very obvious and others aren't.  The film does falter a bit at times as far as humor is concerned, but it is an overall enjoyable experience.

The DVD comes with a nice helping of extras.  I'm not a big fan of in-film commentary, but I must admit that the commentary provided by the cast and crew of ""Fanboys"" is a highlight of the special features this time around.  There are also deleted scenes, webisodes, and other tidbits that I'm sure most ""Star Wars"" fans will enjoy.

In all honesty, this film only registers three stars when viewed by general audiences.  Science fiction fans will probably enjoy it to a much higher degree and therefore I gave it four stars.  Is it for everybody? Nope, but if you are a real fanboy, you have probably already decided whether or not you want to watch this film.  I personally recommend it to ""Star Wars"" fans.

3161642,3,B0016MJ6GA,"Fanboys: 5 out of 10: The back-story behind this film is much more interesting than what appears on the screen. It seems in a galaxy far far away the evil Harvey 'Darth' Weinstein wanted to cut out the main plot of this movie. (Kid dying of cancer wants to see Star Wars Episode One before he dies.) The rebel alliance (Director Kyle Newman) fought a guerilla battle against Harvey and won so the film is now released with the Linus dying of cancer subplot intact.

Well, since the movie itself seems too conveniently ignore the Linus cancer plot at regular intervals, (Chris Marquette who plays Linus looks like he is about to run a triathlon rather than someone with a fatal illness. He is like a male Ali McGraw) one can be excused to ponder what the hubbub was about.

In actuality the cancer subplot was the second most ridiculous story line in the film with the first being Sam Huntington's quest to not inherit his fathers 12 car dealerships... cause becoming a multimillionaire overnight means abandoning your dreams of drawing comic books?

Fanboys is funny in spots and has some great performances including Kristen Bell as the perfect geek girl and Dan Fogler who is the spiritual reincarnation of Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Revenge of the Nerds) and great cameos including William Shatner.

The main leads (Marquette and Huntington) are charisma free drips however and the movie suffers from an overall sloppiness. For example it takes place in 1998 yet is chock full of items that simply did not exist back then (IMDB has a nice list here). Getting the poster of Darth Vader wrong, (It is the version from Episode 3) or having a scene in a comic book store with modern comics visible on the shelves seems like small things. However, this is a movie for fanboys. If there is one group that would notice such sloppiness it is they.

Overall a hit or miss road comedy with a Star Wars veneer, Fanboys is well meaning but not really worth the time.",1256083200,,1960,4.6695652173913045
3161643,5,B0016MJ6GA,"The husband and I were greatly disappointed when Fanboys wasn't released in the theaters in our area.  We had to wait for the DVD - boo-hiss.  A few weeks ago we bought the DVD hoping that it would be as funny as the previews made it out to be.  We weren't disappointed.

As a self-professed sci-fi geek, I really appreciated the story and humor in the movie.  The Star Wars references, sound effects especially, were hilarious.  There were several cameos that just made you laugh.  The storyline was interesting, taking place about 6 months prior to the release of Phantom Menace.  The actors were great too.  They came off as complete Star Wars geeks in the movie - it was great.

My only warnings - The humor is crude at times, so if you don't like crude humor, you might want to stay away.  And very important - I do NOT recommend this for anyone under the age of 13.  I have 3 kids, ages 8, 9 & 10, who love Star Wars.  They've seen Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest, both spoofs of the great movie.  They, however, will not be seeing this one until they are older.  There are adult themes and activities that aren't appropriate for that age.",1255046400,,1141,4.392344497607655

That alone grants it an extra star.  There are a lot of ""in"" jokes that are purely for the fanboys of the world.  This movie had a roller coaster ride to finally getting released on DVD and if you are a fun a Star Wars or have ever been a HUGE fan for any sci-fi movie/TV show/comic etc, then you should support your fellow fans and give this flick a try.",1254700800,,506,4.13265306122449
3161645,5,B0016MJ6GA,"This movie is hilarious.

I also found it to be a heartfelt and honest portrayal of obsessive Star Wars fans. This feeling was shared by my wife and the other couple in my home audience. We busted many guts throughout.

This is a teenage road trip movie. It's one of the best ones I've seen. In addition, it has more heart than the average one as it's about friends trying to fulfill the wish of a friend who is dying rather than about trying to get laid. However, the movie isn't about being sad about death, it's about fulfilling dreams. The humor isn't impaired at all.

I read some negative/critical reviews here on Amazon before I watched it, but I disagree with them after having seen the film. If the movie itself had made fun of the characters, it would have made this film shallow and removed the charm of the characters. The humor in the film works great without making of fun of the characters for their single-minded nature. Their idiosyncrasies is what gives them their charm and personality.

You don't have to be an obsessive sci-fi geek to love this movie (though having seen Star Wars would definitely be a plus).",1254700800,,1130,4.551724137931035

Linus was the terminally ill friend, not Eric (he was the heir to the used car dealership). And Kirk's fictional hometown was in Iowa not Ohio. The boys were driving from their hometown in Ohio. Please... if you're going to review a movie, please at least pay some attention to it, especially if you're an ""official"" Amazon reviewer.

Any way, I found the movie very touching. There were a few scenes that were a bit over the top, but overall I think it captured the essence of being a true Star Wars fan. By the way I found the last line of the movie to be one of the best lines ever.",1254182400,,720,4.294117647058823
3161647,2,B0016MJ6GA,"I had heard that this was a creative and unpolished roadtrip movie, and given the subject matter of star wars fanboyism, I just had to see for myself. From the first few minutes I found my hopes a little deflated by the bad acting, cliche' screen play writing, and farce-laden comedy that seemed out of place with the film's obvious attempt to build a real story around real characters for which I was expected to invest some level of emotional involvement. That deflated enthusiasm was never restored, and continued to errode as the movie wore on. The characters (and their ""issues"") were cardboard cut-outs with predictable over-reactions, arguments, and the like. The plot movement felt more like a shakey waggon with loosely tied luggage falling off at every bump than the solid, streamlined plot development of a well done movie. There were a few moments that were well done and enjoyable, but they were like dull jewels that seemed to get swept under the rug by another offense by the time you had dusted them off well enough to enjoy the glow. The counterpart to this film that 'did it right' would be ""High Fidelity"" which mastered the art of depicting fanboys in their element of geekdom while at the same time painting a genuine story with believable characters. Ditto with Galaxy Quest (which is coming to Blu-ray at long last). Watch either High Fidelity or Galaxy Quest if you'd like to watch this concept set to film the right way.

3161658,5,B0016MJ6GA,"Four twenty-something childhood friends with a shared obsession for the greatest movie trilogy of all-time (Star Wars, for the clueless), reunite for the ultimate mission: To travel cross-country to George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of ""Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" to view months before its official release. There's an honorable cause driving their madness though, as the group's most heartfelt member, Linus, is terminal with cancer and may not live to see the film otherwise. Together with rambunctious scoundrel Hutch (who drives a Star Wars fan's dream-van) and uber-nerd Windows, Linus and his ""straying from the Force"" best-friend, Eric, set out on the trip of a lifetime in search of their own, personal Death Star.

As the motley crew of rebels makes its way on the open road, naturally, they have a series of mishaps and misadventures. (*Mild Spoilers*) Their distaste for Trekkies leads them to a confrontation at a Captain Kirk statue dedication in Iowa. Soon after, they accidentally stumble into the wrong biker bar, have a strange experience with some marijuana-laced guacamole, Windows finally meets his internet dreamgirl, and an encounter with Harry Knowles of ""Ain't It Cool News"" sends them to Vegas for a secret meeting with a Skywalker Ranch insider, but not before they land themselves in jail and have to get bailed out by the comic shop hottie with a crush on one of the guys. Of course, it all leads up to one crazy infiltration attempt on Skywalker Ranch and a very touching finale.

So, that's the story of ""Fanboys"", quite simply, a film made for lovers of all-things Star Wars. Trekkies, beware; while this film may have some moments you'd enjoy, it definitely mocks the Trek. If you don't have a good sense of humor or acknowledge the fact that Star Wars is superior, you may just want to pick up a copy of ""Free Enterprise"" instead. Great film, but it's the Trek version of ""Fanboys"". ""Free Enterprise"" is more original and intellectual, and I love it because it goes beyond just Trek, but I gotta say, as a diehard, lifelong Star Wars fanatic, it made me anxious for something like ""Fanboys"" to come along.

Of course, ""Fanboys"" isn't perfect. The road-trip mission plot is anything but new, and the weak spots are some of those aforementioned misadventures. Two in particular come to mind. The gay biker bar bit seemed uninspired, though I liked the parallel with the Mos Eisley Cantina, and all the stuff right after that involving ""The Chief"" seemed rushed and awkward (don't get me wrong, who doesn't love Danny Trejo?). In general, there were times of missed opportunities to make things just a bit funnier. On the upside though, the film is still wholly enjoyable thanks to all the clever things that are included, mostly being Star Wars references, terrific cameos, and the humor of having a pop-culture obsession, thankfully treated here with total respect; something else that makes this a great film. ""Fanboys"" also has a great cast of rising stars, with Chris Marquette of ""Just Friends"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain"" as Linus, Sam Huntington of ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and ""Superman Returns"" as Eric, Dan Fogler from ""Balls of Fury"" as Hutch, Jay Baruchel of ""Tropic Thunder"" as Windows, Seth Rogan in multiple and hilarious roles, and the gorgeously stunning as always Kristen Bell as Zoe, the feisty comic shop princess. And, yes, girls like that do exist. There isn't one at my local comic shop, but I've seen them working the shop booths at Wizard World Texas(R.I.P.). I'll always remember a particularly cute one I saw the past two years from a comic shop in Plano. Though, I don't buy the filmmakers' implication that girls like that go unnoticed by the geeks around them because their interests make them ""one of the guys"". Nah, those girls are usually dating one of the comic shop employees, that's the problem, but I digress...

Yes, as I mentioned, one of the things that makes ""Fanboys"" great is that it treats the fans with respect (of course, that's what some critics seem to have had a problem with). It even cleverly handles the whole controversy of Episode 1 being... not good. Which is not my own opinion, just a seemingly popular one. In addition, the plot point of Linus's terminal condition adds a great depth to the whole thing that was nearly lost. Apparently, executive producer Harvey Weinstein wanted that left on the cutting room floor. Thank the Force that didn't happen. Fascinating that Director Kyle Newman seems to have gotten a taste of the very Dark Side George Lucas himself grew disgusted of having to deal with in Hollywood. And, before I forget to mention it, another very clever aspect of the film are the parallels with the Star Wars saga and its characters. It's not simple or overly in your face, thank goodness, as the characters even trade roles sometimes in terms of the parallels. Though, there's no question who Princess Leia is, and it's a shame she wears the gold bikini so briefly...

The DVD of ""Fanboys"" (currently, unfortunately, frustratingly, inexplicably not available on Blu in the U.S. at the time of this review) presents the film in widescreen with a PG-13 rating. It's nice to see a modern, 20-something roadtrip movie with a PG-13 rating, and I'm especially glad since Star Wars appeals to a wide age-range. Though, in all honesty, the PG-13 rating is misused these days. The crude humor (at least some of which I hear was producer-demanded in this case, though it's thankfully not excessive) is not something I'd call appropriate for 13 year-olds, ha. If memory serves, the PG-13 rating was created to deal more with violence than sexual and drug references, but now it seems to allow a very inappropriate amount of said material under its mantle. For such content, PG-15 or 16 would make more sense. But, hey, I don't really care that much, as I'm not a teen nor a parent. I just find it an interestingly disturbing thing what is officially considered acceptable for 13 year-olds these days. I prefer to avoid the whole issue and get ""unrated"" versions myself when available, ha. That way, it doesn't matter what your age is. Anyway, the DVD serves up a nice little collection of extras. We get deleted scenes (including the cut William Katt cameo; I wonder why they reshot that), a very entertaining and enlightening cast and crew commentary, a handful of behind the scenes featurettes and some behind-the-scenes webisodes as well. It's a shame they didn't try to get Lucas to let them put the Star Wars Holiday Special on there too.

So, I guess that's about it. ""Fanboys"" is not perfect, but it's still definitely great overall and thoroughly appreciated by myself and I suspect legions of others. However, if you're not a Star Wars fan, it might not do anything for you at all. It's probably not totally crucial to enjoyment of the film, but it certainly must help greatly. If you ARE a Star Wars fan though, definitely get this film. It's a MUST OWN!",1251158400,3,6997,4.841269841269841
3161659,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I have to start with a question: is there some law that says that every comedy made today has to have an unfunny fat guy in it? Dan Folger is one of the least funny people I've ever seen on film. I mean, spectacularly unfunny. Yet he was front and center in this film. I know it was because he had been in the spectacularly unfunny BALLS OF FURY. The equally unfunny Seth Rogen seems to be in nearly all of these films as well. There must be some people out there who find these guys, or others like him, like Jonah Hill. But of all the unfunny fat guys populating movies today, the worst is Dan Folger. Doubt me? Watch GOOD LUCK CHUCK. Though Dane Cook did the yeoman's work in making that one a stinker, Folger's scenes took the film to a whole new level of awful. And not only did this movie have Folger at his near worse, it also had Seth Rogen in three whole roles, each one less funny than the next. When I talk to friends about how awful these guys are, I get nothing but passionate agreement. I've yet to see someone who thinks either Dan Folger or Seth Rogen is funny. Oh, I know some people online say that, but none of my real life friends can stand them. So about one and a half of the stars that were removed in my review are due to Dan Folger and Seth Rogen.

Folger and Rogen aside, I had fun watching this. There were some good jokes, many of them pretty nerdy in jokes, and a number of pretty pleasant moments. The only huge negatives were Folger and Rogen. Well, and possibly that there was less Kristen Bell than there could have been. She is largely absent in the first half of the film, but enlivened the second half. I also enjoyed seeing Jay Baruchel in the film. I haven't seen a great deal of him since the lamentably short run of UNDECLARED. The movie has a couple of nice cameos from William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams to represent both the STAR WARS and STAR TREK universes. And Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes have a very brief, but relatively funny, cameo.

There is a bit of a story -- a road trip by four guys (one of them terminally ill) in 1998 to go to Skywalker Ranch in California to steal the rough cut of the new THE PHANTOM MENACE -- but this is just a loose skeleton to hand a host of cultural references. If you hate popular culture and Sci-fi, you probably will hate this movie. A lot of the fun of the film is working through all the references, including the inevitable Boba Fett nod. All in all it is a fun film. If only Dan Folger had not been in the film it might have been a good one. Still, if you enjoy films about nerds, you should get a kick out of this.",1250380800,,2623,4.161417322834645

If that were the case I would have been forced to sit and waste more time than the hour or so watching this that I did without the option of blissfully turning it off.

Star Wars obsessed fans waste time doing things that are so tired and obviously have been taken from other buddy roadtrip/fraternity/partying movies that have been made. All while being under the umbrella of a wanna-be meaningful ""Make a Dream"" foundation premise. In my opinion what the makers of this movie didn't get was that the same group they were marketing to don't need a Star Wars theme-they just watch their DodgeBall, Van Wilder, Benchwarmers, Year One and Rob Schneider movies for the same effect. That effect- nerds, geeks, losers, lazy moochers off society can have fun, get into some CRAZY predicaments and get girls too.

Kevin Smith and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog did it well-this did not. This one was just plain bad.

I was one of the few lucky folks that got to see it in the theater, after which, I counted the days until the DVD release. I dragged my wife (not a big sci-fi fan) to see it and she got a few good laughs out of it. She did not, however, see the genius behind it.

Another great thing this movie had were all the cameos including Seth Rogen playing multiple characters, can you say awesome. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie involved the 4 guys taking a detour on the way toSkywalker Ranch to go to Iowa and battle it out with some Star Trek nerds.

In the end, I think it was all the random cameos that really made the movie for me. I would highly suggest this to any Star Wars fan and anyone like me that's enjoyed Star Wars in the past but maybe needed a break. Watch This Movie.",1245542400,,1170,4.337899543378995

The movie is funny and full of guest stars throughout the entire film. The theme is great if you are an avid Star Wars fan. If not then you may not get some of the jokes but even past that this is a definite rent if you like star wars, a buy if you love star wars.",1245456000,,391,3.7228915662650603

After many years of it being pushed around and forgotten about it was released to theaters in limited viewing, a few months later its out on DVD.  Not too surprising.  The film itself is rather boring.  The only reason I would suggest watching the movie is for the brief scene with Kevin Smith and Jason Mews.  There is an easy walk around that you can go to the deleted scenes and watch and extended cut of the scene.",1245456000,6,565,4.3428571428571425

I don't laugh aloud a lot when watching movies, usually just a little smirk and a soft ""ha."" I was laughing aloud with this one. It was great straight to the last line.
If you care about this sort of thing, it did get pretty dirty here and there.

3161680,4,B0016MJ6GA,"then let me ease your mind, the movie is funny. it is serious in parts,but it helps us to get to know the characters more. anyone who love star wars, either old or new trilogies. Anyone who gets the reason why lucas released episode IV first...anyone who has ever read comics or ever had heated discussions over who shot first han or greedo..then this movie is for you. You do not have to know every single line of every lucas film or every ""geek movie"" to get the jokes, some are implied jokes which means even if you don't know the subject they are making fun of, the joke is more or less universal. Of course the more you know the better the movie is. such as the security at skywalker ranch being dressed as THX cops. not sure what they were called in that film though. Anyway the person writing the review of this movie doesn't get it. (the product description etc) this is a movie for those who love the movies and love the whole idea of an ""event movie"" star wars wasn't just about the movies themselves it was about the friends we made while waiting in line, or the conversations you had at the toy store with other people who watched the movie. This movie is funny in a way that's not forced on us. Meaning the jokes come naturally as any would in our day to day conversations, nothing is forced or thrown in your face, it's all pretty much there as it would be in every day life. Someone compared this to Kevin Smith's humor. That is pretty close to what you get here. The dialogue drive a lot of the humor and the situations of course are absurd, but that's what you expect in comedy. If you did like the humor of those Kevin Smith films especially Clerks and Mallrats you will love what is in this movie. Too bad Jay and silent Bob didn't have a bigger part. Even casual fans of sci-fi will love the humor and you don't have to be a star wars junkie or a trekkie to enjoy the scenes between the star wars and star trek fans. and the cameo of William Shatner was priceless. Though I was half expecting a priceline comment considerring what he helped them with in the film, though that may be a legal reason why he didn't mention it. This movie is great fun and it's at a great price. So just get it and enjoy. Be warned though the humor isn't for everyone in the family. Some humor is more adult in nature.

3161681,1,B0016MJ6GA,I had been waiting the release of this movie sense I first heard about it back in 2006. It finally comes out and I am seriously disappointed.

To quote his review: ""the guards look like characters Lucas might have considered for either of the two trilogies"". He is talking about the guards in THX-1138 costumes - an ""inside"" joke that probably only die-hard Lucas fans will understand. That pretty much sums up this movie. If you are a true Fanboy or Fangirl, you'll get all of the references and parallels and I think you'll get a lot more out of this movie than other people.

It sort of just 'came and went' until I saw a reference to it the other day. I looked it up on Amazon and it was available so I bought it.

I'm really glad I did.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.

I grew up when Star Wars first came out, so seeing all the 'inside jokes' and the cameos in the film was a real treat.
I watched it again with my girlfriend a few days later and enjoyed it just as much as the first time.

The jokes are pretty goofy but I expected them from this kind of film.
Nothing terribly original in them, but they are executed well.

It's a fun popcorn flick and if you're hip to Star wars (or know any rabid fans), it's definitely worth watching.

I gave it 4-stars because hey, it ain't Shakespeare.
If you're expecting Oscar-winning performances, then maybe you should just pass on this. Otherwise I really recommend it.",1244764800,,968,4.239130434782608
3161684,4,B0016MJ6GA,"I have watched this twice on DVD. Unfortunately it did not hit the big screens here in Australia, so I only see it at home. In a word - hilarious! I think that this is the ultimate tribute film to Star Wars.
I would have liked to have seen a feature length version of Kevin Rubio's ""Troops"" but this is the next best thing. Choc full of cameos by veteran Star Wars actors, Kevin Smith, Jason Mews and unforgatable roles by Seth Rogan. If you don't know what this is about, basically it is a road trip movie with four Star Wars Fans plus a girl determined to break into Skywalker ranch to see a ""rough cut"" version of ""Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" so that one of them can see it before he dies of terminal cancer. Although not much is made of the cancer tradgedy and you can tell from the editing that this is not meant to be a focal point of the movie, it could've been; instead it heavily relies on endless Star Wars references and Satr Wars related sight gags. If more was made of the cancer tradgedy then it would have added to the drama significantly. If you hate Star Wars (I feel sorry for you), then this movie is not for you, you will not get many of the jokes. If you love Star Wars then I am certain you will at the very least find this a fun ride. My favourite line is the very last one of the movie. I won't ruin it for you but it sums up how we all felt in 1999. I just wish this movie actually came out around several years ago when the world was in the grip of main stream Star Wars mania, not just the fans. Time will tell if it becomes a cult classic. I hope so",1244505600,,1591,4.0062893081761

3161686,3,B0016MJ6GA,"Yes, this film was supposed to come out two years ago.  Yes, it was reshot and had a hard time in test screenings.  Yes, it's from the Weinstein company, who are now notorious, even when they were with Miramax, for fiddling with a movie so much that it barely resembles the project it was intended to be before filming began.  Yes, it got a very limited theatrical run but ultimately became a direct to video release.  And yes, I absolutely don't care.  I'm just going to review this dvd based on the film presented.

The film is called Fanboys, but it's not really a comedic dissection of these loley outcasts and their obssessions.  It's just about some Star Wars fanboys who go on a trek to see Episode I nine months early for their friend who has a 'terminal disease'.  Unfortunately, this film uses the dying friend as a plot device rather then anything meaningful.  They don't even have the balls to name what 'terminal disease' the boy has.  From what the movie presents us with, it can't be that bad, the kid looks pretty healthy, and if it's some form of cancer, he's quite mobile and active.  I hate, HATE, when movies use a 'disease' for cheap sentimental reactions from the more simple in the audience, and it's even worse when you can tell the writer's can't even hide the fact that they don't take the concept seriously or even elaborate on it in anything remotely insightful.

Sure, many will claim, ""It's just a screw-ball comedy, what'd you expect Gone With The Wind?""  Those who say that need to raise their expectations so maybe in the future Hollywood will release more quality films that have a chance of lasting beyond the opening weekend grosses.  This movie would've benefited from dropping the dying friend altogether or creatively mingling the plot line into the narrative in a funny and honest way.  Death doesn't always have to be presented as a ship sinker.  Terms of Endearment is a very funny film that is also very sad.  It can be done.  The dying friend is simply a cheap ploy to illicit undeserved emotinal responses from viewers, and from looking at the Amazon reviews for this film, it worked to a degree.  How very sad.

Okay, enough bitching.  I give the three star rating because the things that work in the film really work and made me laugh and smile.  The characters are distinct enough and have enough funny schtick to entertain.  I used to consider myself a real movie nerd, until I met too many real fanboys.  They ruin everything.  They make everything narrow and in a vaccuum.  I know as much about the subject of film as them, but manage to keep my priorities straight.  They're really lame.  The fanboys in this film are filtered down versions of the geeks that really exist.  In other words their tolerable and relatable to a degree.

The film has some great cameos that illicit many laughs.  Especially, the great Seth Roegen in the duel roles of a Trek nerd and a Star Wars nerd who happens to also be a Las Vegas pimp.  Shatner shows up All The President's Men style and steals the whole movie, as usual.  The gags and jokes are sophmoric but funny.  The actors work over time to sell all the moments.  Plus, you have to be somewhat of a geek to get a lot of the jokes.  Who else, outside the movie biz, would actually know who and what Harry Knowles looks like?  Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams show up, but add nothing funny to the film oddly enough, considering the film revolves around the mythos of the films that made both of them famous.

The dvd is loaded.  There's a very funny and informative commentary track by the cast and director, it's more entertaining then the actual film.  Of course the issue of the film's troubled history is mostly avoided.  We also get some deleted scenes that were rightfully deleted.  The making of features are mostly fluff.  Just cast and crew blowing smoke and giving nothing insightful, though they all come off and as good intentioned as their movie counterparts.

The movie is worth a rent.  It has many funny moments, but the whole sentimental side of the film really collapses this thing from becoming a comedy classic.  The tone is so off.  One moment it's Road Trip and the next it's a cheesy and undemanding 'special' episode of Full House.",1244419200,2,4250,4.583001328021249

If the subject matter wasn't something that I hold near and dear to my heart I would have stopped viewing this movie half way through. There is nothing special about anything in this film other than the Star Wars connection. The main actors are just average, the direction is film student level, with a script that has to rely far too often on childish slapstick instead of genuine comedy. This movie is just basically watered down little bits of every gag and every punch line you've already seen in dozens and dozens of other movies. Yes, it's apparent that the director is a movie fan but I didn't see anything that would make me believe he has anything unique to offer. There are a few redeeming moments in this film but far too many comedy cliches regurgitated from other films that did it so much better.
It's too bad Seth Rogen and Keven Smith had small roles in the movie instead of being the writer and director.

With a touching plot and many special cameo appearances, this film was definitely what the Star Wars fan in me has been craving for so long. This is a must-see for any diehard Star Wars fan! I really enjoyed the touching storyline that lie beneath the humorous antics: one being the dying wish of a friend, and the other being about following your heart and, as Joseph Campbell would say, ""following your way to bliss"" rather than simply settle for a life that you don't love or enjoy.

As I said, the Star Wars references are plenty and there is even a big mention of the unspoken rivalry between Star Wars fans and Trekkies -- I'm sorry -- Trekkers. Of course, there was a big dispute between fanboys of this film and its producer (Harvey Weinstein) as to whether the subplot of the dying friend should be included or re-edited. In the end, thankfully, the fans won and the storyline remained. I think it's a better movie for it. Otherwise, it's just another piece of Star Wars memomorablia to add to the shelves. My only complaint with ""Fanboys"" is that the easily-lovable Kristen Bell doesn't have as big a part as I would've liked and the story could've explored more into the friendship between Huntington and Marquette's friendship (i.e. what exactly drove them apart). Still, for what this movie is - a quick, wacky comedy with heart - it is good enough to earn a spot on my DVD shelves. After all, c'mon, man! It's the Wars!!!",1242777600,,1692,4.621262458471761

If you are not that much into Star Wars (because you were born too late, or are ""weird"" ;-)), there is still a great deal of comedy for this flic to be a pleasant ride. Hope you have a blast! Maybe then we can get some more made...

------------------------------------
It's geeky guest-star cameos galore in this pop-culture mega-farce about four - no, wait, five! -- Star Wars fans from Ohio who live out their fifth-grade dream of breaking into George Lucas' Marin County ranch in order to see a ""sneak peak"" of Episode One of the Star Wars films. It's a road trip flick packed with pop-culture references and nerd humor, as well as appearances by folks such as Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith & Jason Mewes, Billy Dee Willams, Carrie Fisher and --gasp!!-- William Shatner. It's pretty funny, if a bit strained at times... Mostly, it's familiar, and comforting in a way, like an old friend whose just showed up at your door and needs a place to crash for a month or two.  The THX-1138 references at the end are especially welcome. Funny and fun!",1242604800,,835,4.921985815602837
3161701,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I really liked Fanboys except for one thing... the movie uses genuine Star Wars props and costumes all over the place, and yet it dresses up the Star Trek fans in ridiculous parodies of the correct costumes.

I could really care less that they portray the fans themselves as they do, but why the goofy wrong uniforms and props for the Trek people?

If they were asked, it's likely that Paramount denied the filmmakers permission to use the correct items.  If I had been the filmmakers in that position, I would have thrown up a big title page at the start of the movie saying so. The filmmakers have to be aware that an awful lot of Star Wars fans are *also* Trek fans, and vice versa.  The militant division between the two depicted by the movie is the exception, not the rule.  So why alienate people (pun intended)?

Ok... maybe there was one other thing I didn't like.  Not nearly enough Kristin Bell!",1242604800,,905,4.4817073170731705

I first saw this movie at Comic-con San Diego last year after waiting in line for several hours to score a pass to it. And I LOVED IT! It was hilarious, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. But the title really fits the movie, because it was a story about fans, about the die-hard, obsessed fans that most people mock, but the ones who shape and define their lives by what they love the most. The writers perfectly balanced the comedy, the sentimental plot of a true fan who wasn't going to live long enough to see the new SW movie, and the inside look at what ""fanboys"" really are like.

The only problem I have with the movie is that there are so many inside jokes and references to the series that non-fans wouldn't understand. But, then, the movie really seems to be targeted towards SW fans in particular, so there's not a huge loss I would guess. But if you've never seen a SW movie (and *gasp*, what's wrong with you? Get yourself to a Blockbuster ASAP!), you'll probably be lost at various points throughout the movie.

Anyway, you have probably known people like this if you are not a fanboy/fangirl yourself.  In reality, everyone has something they're into, some hobby or interest to displace boredom.

I digress.  I thought this movie was the funniest I had seen in a long time.  What really struck me about this movie was how even after seeing the previews the movie was still funny.  The trailers didn't give everything away either.  Too many times in the last couple years have movies, especially blockbusters, been so awful that I considered just not watching another new movie again, ever.

You need to have seen the trilogy in order to be able to know some of the references, and if you're a huge fan you'll laugh even more than I did since they make both big and little references.

I swear, Hutch looks just like the guy behind the counter at the comic shop downtown.

This has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of James T. Kirk's home town. That fan-built statue is a hoot, when you look at just how much cod there is in the codpiece.

3395570,4,B0016MJ6GA,"1998, and every ""Star Wars"" fan was abuzz. Episode 1 was finally coming out. No, Episode 1 did not come out in 1977. That first film was really Episode 4.

Fans were camping out at movie theatres in anticipation of tickets going on sale. ""Fanboys"" is the story of four friends who realize that one of them will not be there for the opening.  Linus (Chris Marquette) has cancer and they really want him to see ""The Phantom Menace."" Their idea:  break into Skywalker Ranch and see the first cuts.

Eric (Sam Huntington) isn't quite on the page yet.  He's abandoned the dream of creating a comic book and  literally sold out, selling cars at his Dad's dealership.  He hasn't seen Linus in years and doesn't even realize his best friend has cancer.

Hutch (Dan Fogler) despite still living in his Mom's 'carriage house' is a pretty good persuader. And Windows (Jay Baruchel) has found an online girlfriend ""Rogue Leader"" who will help them with plans, etc. for Skywalker Ranch.

Still, they manage to get on the road and what a long strange trip it is from Ohio to California.  We've got cameo appearances by William Shatner, Billy D. Williams, and Carrie Fisher.

This is a film for every fan who's stood out in the rain in line or played cards on the floor of a theatre waiting for tickets.  The only thing serious about this film is the fun and it's definitely worth full price to see it.

3395571,5,B0016MJ6GA,"This is a movie that is not to be missed! This movie may not be for everyone, but for the millions of Star Wars lovers worldwide, this movie will rocks your sides off!  The producers have taken a cast of some of the wackiest and most talented young comics of the day and pared them with a storyline that makes me want to laugh just to think of it!

A bunch of long-time friends who are die-hard Star Wars fans decide to drive cross-country on a ""quest"" to break into George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and steal a copy of the Phantom Menace.  It takes a special brand of insanity to pull off a trip like this, but these guys are motivated!

Sit back, relax and get ready for the road trip of your life!",1235779200,,697,4.17910447761194
3395572,2,B0016MJ6GA,"The premise of ""Fanboys"": In 1998, a group of diehard ""Star Wars"" fanatics decide to drive to Marin County, California, break into Skywalker Ranch, steal an early print of ""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,"" and see it before general release the following year. Even within the context of a goofy comedy, this idea could not be any less plausible. It hints at satire, but it never goes any further than that because, in order for satire to work, you actually have to be making fun of something. ""Fanboys"" is not constructed like that; it glorifies extreme fandom, as if it were something to be proud of. It regards four socially inept people as heroes. Acts of stupidity are treated not as warnings against that kind of behavior but as loving tributes to unwavering devotion.

So this begs the question: If this movie is so keen on exalting ""Star Wars"" super fans, why make it a comedy? Why have the characters look like complete idiots? Don't they deserve better than being depicted as nerdy stereotypes? I recall ""Trekkies,"" a fascinating documentary from 1997 that explored the ""Star Trek"" universe and the fans who inhabit it; that film is a much more tolerable example of how extreme fandom can be glorified, simply because it showed real people. Sure, some of them seemed very silly on camera, but at least they drew from what was actually within. They weren't just following along with a juvenile screenplay. Maybe ""Fanboys"" would have worked much better as a documentary about ""Star Wars"" fans.

The story focuses on four twenty-something ""Star Wars"" fans from Ohio. Eric (Sam Huntington) works for his father (Christopher McDonald) at a car dealership. While Eric appears happy at the prospect of taking over the family business, his real passion is drawing comic books. So you might say that being offered his father's dealership is like being tempted by the dark side of the Force. Anyway, he finds out that his best friend, Linus (Christopher Marquette), has been diagnosed with cancer. Knowing that he might not live to see the release of ""The Phantom Menace,"" Eric decides to take Linus on a road trip to Skywalker Ranch, where a rough cut of the prequel is ready and waiting to be stolen.

Along for the ride are two other friends. One is the spectacled Windows (Jay Baruchel), who hopes to meet the girl he's been chatting with online, the one who provided him with blueprints to Skywalker Ranch. The other is Hutch (Dan Fogler), who drives a black van decked out with various ""Star Wars"" accents, including an R2-D2 dome, a paintjob of the first film's poster, and a forbidden red button on the dashboard that can blast the engine into light speed. The only out-of-place touch: A collection of Rush albums, all on audiocassette tapes. Hutch runs a comic book store and still lives in his mother's garage. He calls it a carriage house, which is about the same as calling a basement a subterranean chamber.

There comes a point when they're joined by Zoey (Kristen Bell), who, as far as Windows is concerned, represents a paradox: She's a beautiful young woman, and yet she's a ""Star Wars"" fan. Just as paradoxical is the fact that she's beautiful and has a crush on Windows. It seems he's allowed to lust after beautiful girls, but beautiful girls aren't allowed to like him for who he is.

As they travel, they make a couple of interesting pit stops, the first being a town in Iowa where fanatical ""Star Trek"" enthusiasts gather at a statue of James Kirk and Khan (neither of which bear a likeness to the actors who played them). This paves the way for one of the films worst scenes, in which our four friends get into a brutal fight with a group of people dressed in Starfleet uniforms. This plays into the fact that there's a blood feud between fans of the franchises, which only further demonstrates the depth to which fandom can sink. If you have to duke it out with someone for not liking something you like, you're taking your passion far too seriously. It's one thing to be a fan of something. It's quite another thing to let devotion consume your life.

The real problem here is that ""Fanboys"" is like a spoof that forgot to make fun of what it was spoofing. The characters have personality quirks that are inherently funny, yet we can't laugh at them because they're treated as heroes, not as comedy relief. The only hint of true satire comes in the form of cameo appearances, and even then it doesn't work because the actors are not given anything important to do. Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith, and Jason Mewes show up at certain points, as do ""Star Wars"" alumni Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and Ray Park (a.k.a., the guy who played Darth Maul). One cameo I won't reveal is a source that goes by the code name Scruffy Nerf-Herder.

What I find absolutely amazing is that George Lucas approved of this film. Did he not realize that it was anything but a tribute to ""Star Wars"" and its fans? If anything, it's a painfully unfunny look at how fandom can spin out of control. Its unfocused structure is second only to the tumultuous history of the film's release, which was delayed as far back as August of 2007 due to reshoots and a disagreement over the cancer subplot. Test audiences apparently preferred to leave it in, although I'm not sure why since it clashes with the film's overall goofball tone. There's a moment between Eric and Linus that's so shamelessly sentimental, it's as if the filmmakers forgot that ""Fanboys"" was intended to be a comedy. You can't believably create a tender moment after nearly ninety minutes of sophomoric gags.",1234396800,9,5581,4.712090163934426

Since this was finally released, figured I should come back & give an *actual* review, haha.  okay.... 1st off, I'm not a big ""comedy"" guy... I usually just rent them; & own less than a dozen (half of which are Kevin Smith movies!).  Anyway, this movie is AWESOME & I'm so glad it Finally came out.  I've watched it several times now (I do own it), & it's AS Funny each & every time... which is a rare thing in Comedies (which again, is why I typically don't bother buying them).  I'll never understand why it took so long, or why it never hit theaters... it would've been a HUGE success Theatrically; but whatever.

While others are forced to grow up and leave all that behind.  That's what happens with one character.  If you're into Star Wars, you can probably relate to some of the characters. Some if the movie also takes place in one of Albuquerque's local comic book stores.

3395929,5,B0016MJ6GA,"I see a few reviews here giving this movie 2 stars because it's a nerd movie.

I'm giving it 5 stars BECAUSE IT'S A NERD MOVIE!!!

I'm a Star Wars geek. (I'm also a Star Trek geek, so the banter between the two fan bases in this movie was hysterical to me.)

There are so many sci-fi references in this movie that it's hard to keep up. And they are worked in seemlessly into the story.

The story itself is your basic road comedy. A bunch of friends have to take a road trip to break into George Lucas' house. (You know, because sometimes the need for that just happens! We've all been there...). It's the same kind of advanture as National Lampoon's Vacation. A bunch of stuff goes wrong and they have to overcome it to get to the destination. On in this case instead of getting help from Cousin Eddie, they get their help from William Shatner. (Oh yeah...Captain Kirk makes an appearence. It's fantastic.)

It's funny. It's sweet (the friends overcome their own internal struggles and bond). And its' nerdy.

If you are a sci-fi fan you have to see this movie. Have to.

Also it takes some pot shots at how bad The Phantom Menace was. And there is always room for that.",1398211200,2,1171,4.368663594470046

3395956,5,B0016MJ6GA,"As a moderately big Star Wars fan, I loved this film.  The main characters are hysterical in their own rights due to both the character designs and the performances of the individual actors/actresses (actress is very important).  Homages to Star Wars are peppered throughout the entire movie, some discretely and others not at all.  However, I must have watched this movie 20+ times and I still find little things that I had never previously noticed each and every time I watch it.  Finally, and most importantly, even if the 95% of this movie was terrible (which is not the case), the remaining 5% contains Kristen Bell in a Slave Leia costume which alone is well worth the price of the movie.",1392854400,3,694,4.710743801652892

3395960,2,B0016MJ6GA,"When buying this flm I assumed too much and as result I was as cruelly disappointed as Darth Vader when Luke, Leia & Co escaped from the Cloud City. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of a group of friends, Eric (Sam Huntington), Hutch (Dan Fogler), Linus (Chris Marquette), Windows (Jay Baruchel) and Zoe (Kristen Bell) who are obsessive Star Wars fans (well, Zoe is maybe just a little bit more reasonable than the boys). They are very excited that a new Star Wars movie (The Phantom Menace) will open in six months - but then they learn that Linus has terminal stage cancer and there is no way he will live that long. So they immediately decide to go on a quest - drive to Texas, break into Skywalker ranch and steal one copy of the film, so Linus can see it before dying. This film describes this noble (and completely crazy) quest.

Before going further, for sake of full disclosure I must confess something. Yes, I am totally a Star Wars fanboy, quite a desperate case in fact - and proud of being one too! That being said, I actually love Star Wars spoofs and parodies (""Spaceballs"", ""Robot Chicken"", ""How it should have ended"", etc.) as well as all the jokes about fanboys. For some reason even being the butt of such jokes from those who never saw the light (or at least the dark side of the Force) never bothered me - to the contrary I always was and still am the first to have a merry good laugh about it. All of this was the reason why I expected so much from this film - but my disappointment was cruel...

I started to have a bad feeling about this movie already after the first minute. Four minutes later I realised that those were not the droids I was looking for. After 10 minutes I yelled ""It's a trap""! After 20 minutes my count of midi-chlorians reached zero. In the middle of the film I started looking for death sticks. After one hour I felt like complete ""bantha pudu"". After 75 minutes I started calling aloud for a wookie to come and rip my hands of. And towards the end I reached the state of such ultimate mental degradation that - I still cannot believe I am writing it - I had a craving for an appearance by Jar-Jar Binks...

So what went wrong? Well, let me count the ways:

1) This film is mostly not funny. At all. Most of jokes are really lame.

2) Being unable to make good jokes, the director decided to replace them by a lot of VULGARITY. It was a bad decision.

3) The characters are not really likeable and in particular Hutch is simply DISGUSTING. The one exception is Zoe, the only girl in the group - but her character is mostly put on the second plan. I also had some sympathy for Linus, for quite obvious reasons...

4) For all the reasons cited above this not very long film is also by moments quite boring and annoying.

That being said, there are some good scenes. Not many of them, but still:

- the trip to ""enemy territory"" (Iowa) and the confrontation ""fanboys vs. trekkies"" is quite good - but it lasts a grand total of five minutes

- there is a good gag about the cultural difference between Iowa and California, but it takes like 30 seconds in all, divided in two parts

- the meeting with ""The Chief"" (Danny Trejo) is also a good scene (but NOT the scenes which precede it!); but it lasts like two minutes tops...

- the cameos by Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and William Shatner (!) are very good - but each of them lasts less than one minute...

- at the very end Kristen Bell appears for a moment wearing Leia's Golden Bikini; for obvious reasons it is my favourite scene...

- then there is finally the last line said in the film, and that actually is a quite good conclusion - but it is a 5 seconds scene...

Considering however that this film lasts 90 minutes, all above is not enough. The good moments of this film are like 20 000 Republic dataries on Tatooine - not nearly enough to give you satisfaction...

Bottom line, this film is sadly mostly a failure. Which is really, but really a pity, because the initial idea was really great...",1389225600,4,4050,4.3572377158034525

I love the mesh up of the cast and I was surprised to see Kristen Bell in this movie.  The movie's story line is relate-able in a ""Gosh! I wish!"" sort of way.  What can I say, it's probably every fanboy's dream to experience what the Fanboy boys (and one girl) went through.

The movie is not all nerdism and there are some mildly sentimental scenes that get a bit ""Bromance-ish"", but it all adds to the determination placed on these guys.  What I really liked about this movie is the well thought out offensive humor lines.  There is some crude humor involved but not to the point where you find yourself short 10 IQ points.  The wardrobes are to die for and I seriously cringed towards the end when all the prop-replicas came out.  Overall, this movie is a great time to be enjoyed by yourself or with friends.

3396068,4,B0016MJ6GA,"If I can boil it down to one reason - one reason why you should watch Fanboys - it has to be this: Kristen Bell looks mighty fine in her skimpy Slave Leia outfit. There's also that if you've a love or fascination for the Star Wars franchise, well, sir, this film is an unabashed love letter. The screenplay is by Ernest Cline who wrote the amazing sci-fi thriller Ready Player One, and Ernest Cline is like the idiot savant of pop culture references, except minus the idiot part. Even Joss Whedon says, ""Hot damn, this guy's crafty!""

Fanboys takes us back to an infamous era, back to when George Lucas could do no wrong and Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace had yet to be released and nerds all around were clammy with anticipation. On October 31, 1998, in Ohio, four childhood pals with a shared obsession for all things Star Wars unexpectedly reconnect at a Halloween bash. One thing leads to another, nerd passions are rekindled - and factor in, also, that one of the dudes is dying of cancer - and the quartet soon embark on a cross-country trek to infiltrate George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and steal away with a rough cut print of Episode One months before its official release.

As odysseys go, this one's fairly uneventful, that is, if you disregard the po-po and getting thrown in the clink and those angry, vindictive Trekkies and that one incensed p! mp and that pretty messed-up g@y bar. Fanboys is a boisterous coming-of-age story, yessir, and it says stuff about friendship and loyalty and eventually putting away those childish things but maybe holding off on that for just a tiny bit longer. Fanboys is also raunchy and funny and there's a lot of Rush being played (not at all an awful thing). There met be nerd-on-nerd violence as our four Star Wars hardcases tangle with a crew of Star Trek maniacs. We also learn that there may not be much of a difference between a garage and a carriage house.

Do the four chums stay the course and accomplish their far-fetched mission? I won't say. I will say that the surprise cameos are pretty sweet, although I'll defer from dropping any names. And while the gags and jokes regarding the source material seem to be genuinely affectionate in tone, there are those occasional snide remarks that let us know the filmmakers are well aware of the fallout to this second batch of Star Wars films. When the friends are finally poised to view Episode One, one guy turns to another and, in a slightly panicked voice, asks the unthinkable: ""What if it sucks?"" That kid must've been prescient. Lastly and again, Kristen Bell is so hot in that Slave Leia outfit, my lightsaber went ""Hhrrrmmm!"" I also got a b0ner.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Audio Commentary with director Kyle Newman, writers Ernie Cline and Adam F. Goldberg, and actors Dan Fogler, Kristen Bell, and Sam Huntington
- 6 Deleted Scenes (totals 00:07:50 minutes and includes a funny extended scene with Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes)
- ""Disturbances in the Force"" - a series of 7 webisodes that takes you behind the scenes of Fanboys (totals 00:11:40 minutes and worth it just to see Kristen Bell do the Sprite commercial rap)
- ""The Truth about Fanboys"" - director and cast attempt to define what a fanboy is (00:05:49 minutes)
- ""The Star Wars Parallel""  - a few of the film's Star Wars references are mentioned (00:05:19 minutes)
- ""4 Fanboys and 1 Fangirl"" - the principal cast members talk up the characters they play (00:08:50 minutes)

I'm a huge Star Wars nerd and I can honestly say there were almost no funny moments in this movie.  The whole thing feels like a movie not made by fans of Star Wars, but by people who perhaps met a Star Wars fan in passing somewhere.

The cameo appearances are nice, but just about every main actor in this movie is one of those annoying extras from other low budget 2 star movies.

Perhaps you've been among the true believers, though, like the ones who exchange wedding vows in Klingon. Then the stereotypes will all look very familiar. I swear, Hutch looks just like the guy behind the counter at the comic shop downtown.

This has some amusing moments, like the tour guide of James T. Kirk's home town. That fan-built statue is a hoot, when you look at just how much cod there is in the codpiece. A few in-jokes helped too, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THX-1138/dp/B000P3GFWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THX 1138</a>-style guards' masks, or the Shatner cameo.

It sounds like an idea that maybe a group of eight year olds would come doesn't it. That is if they could drive. Unfortunately this hair-brained plan is devised by 5 lifelong sci-fi, comic book fans who happened to be old enough to drive and stupid enough to attempt to do it. As the road unfolds before them, along with an endless series of insane encounters and unpredictable mishaps they experience along the way, their road trip begins to evolve into an epic quest for redemption and an unforgettable rite of passage that none will ever forget.

Critique: I didn't expect much from this film. I wasn't looking forward to wasting my time watching another dime a dozen crazy teenage road trip, low brow humor film. Well..., I was wrong. `Fanboy' is a well thought out, clever, immensely funny film is not only enjoyable on the initial viewing but will stand up well to the repeatability factor.

3396099,5,B0016MJ6GA,"First and foremost, this film features and outstanding young cast: Sam Huntingon (Not Another Teen Movie), Chris Marquette (hilarious in The Girl Next Door), Jay Baruchel (funny and awkward as ever), Kristen Bell (gorgeous and talented as always), and Seth Rogan (whose mannerisms always seem to be funny).  Who stole the show, however, was relatively obscure Dan Fogler.  Part Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, part Jack Black without the tendency to irritate, Fogler absolutely stole every scene into which his hairy, obese body waddled (Do a Google picture search for ""awesome none left"" and you get a good idea of what he looks like).

Beyond the superbly blended cast is a heart-warming yet laugh out loud story of a group of twenty-something friends who have wanted one thing for years: to break into George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch and steal a copy of Phantom Menace before its release.  Anyone in the sci-fi community can tell you that this release was HIGHLY anticipated, and executing this plan would have been akin to an Arthurian knight finding the Holy Grail.  Watching the crew band together and embark on this perilous mission reminds me of, oh, I don't know, the crew from Star Wars - minus the midget they should have had for Yoda - perhaps?  Although, it's a bit of a stretch to paint Kristen Bell as an obsessive Star Wars, sci-fi fan who dresses up as Leia and waits in line for the premiere of Phantom Menace; there can only be a handful of girls like that in the world.

For Star Wars and Star Trek fans (i.e. Trekkies or Trekkers, choose one), this movie is saturated with references, superb cameos, trivia, and enough ""insider"" moments to impress the true fanboys.  If you waited in line to see the Phantom Menace and you haven't seen this, you're doing yourself a big disservice (they debate the inherently incestuous relationship between Luke and Leia).  If you're just a random sci-fi fan and you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it.  Even average movie fans should laugh enough to make this enjoyable.

It's basically the story of a group of friends who go on a road trip to steal a copy of Star Wars Episode 1 from George Lucas before it's released. I didn't find myself laughing out loud too much throughout movie... but I did have a smile on my face through most of it. There's a lot of cool cameos, and of course as would be expected in a movie like this a ton of geeky Star Wars (and Star Trek) jokes and references.

I think the reason this one never elevates itself above an average comedy, is that there are way too many overused and cliche plot devices and comedic elements... to the point where it feels a little disingenuous at times. But let's be honest... I'm probably being a little too critical of a movie that wasn't meant to be analyzed, its meant to turn your brain off and enjoy; and that being said I'd say it did its job in that respect.

The movie follows the story of a group of 5 friends. 4 boys 1 girl. One of which is battling cancer and is going to die before The Phantom Menace is released. So the fanboys go on a journey to Lucasranch to steal a copy of TPM so that Linus (the one with cancer) will be able to see it before he dies.

Sure, you will probably laugh a few times, but there are few memorable moments that have not been seen in other comedies in the last ten years.  This movie will choke you with terrible Star Wars references, but try as it might; an obscure reference does not a funny movie make.  I would guess that if you like Dane Cook and Star Wars, you would probably like this movie (yes, Dane Cook is not funny either, he just yells and reminds you of things you have seen before).  There are some good cameos by Billy D. Williams, Carrie Fischer, William Shatner and that guy who played Darth Maul from that movie no one cares about.  The fat kid from Balls of Fury is not funny.  He really wants to be a bad ass in this movie, but I can't accept it.

The problem is that the leads aren't very interesting other than the ones played by Baruchel and Fogler who really give it their all.  A cancer plotline is mentioned, but comes in and out and anyone who has been around cancer will find the movie more than a little insulting with the brevity with which its handled.  It can feel like a series of vignettes with little holding it together, but every time it gets boring there's some new silliness.  Three stars.",1285113600,,752,4.54074074074074

It is always funny to me (being a reseller) that Trekkies will not buy Star Trek stuff if it is next to Star Wars stuff and vice versa.  So the scene in the film where some trekkies go into the (Windows?) comic book store and want to know the price of a Star Trek Phaser, really hit home with me.

There are tons of other great scenes that also caught my eye , but I do not want to spoil it.  Other unique quality of this film is the huge amount of cameos this show has -- such as William Shatner and Carrie Fisher.

Story revolves around a group of friends who really aren't going anywhere.... where Eric (Sam Huntington) feels his life needs direction, as he listlessly works at his father's used car lot, even though his true passion is art, and creating his own comic book, something he put off thinking it was all pipe dreams. Then there are his friends, best friend Linus (Chris Marquette), nerd o'rama Windows (Jay Baruchel), and crazy man, Hutch (Dan Fogler) who has pimped out his van as if it is the Millennium Falcon, and nerd cutie Zoe (Kirsten Bell). These guys live and breath anything fanboy, whether it's arguing who fired first... Han or Greedo, which is better Empire or Jedi, arguing if Boba fett is a genuine bad ass or not, and basically repeating their favorite movie lines in everyday lingo (seriously who doesn't do that? my friends and I do it) anyways turns out Linus finds he has a terminal illness where he and Eric have drifted apart after high school, where Eric thinks what his friends do are childish games, that they never grew up, thinking he is the only one who really moved on from this nonsense, where as with the rest of the group it's a passion something they enjoy, like outdoor enthusiasts enjoying the outdoors, dog lovers that will do anything for an animal, people who collect garden gnomes, it's something they enjoy. Linus knows he will not see Star Wars Episode I, so when Eric realizes this he hatches a plan to go to Skywalker Ranch to steal a copy with the group. On the outside it's a buddy road trip movie, with it comes the hilarity, but deep down it wasn't about stealing one of the most anticipated movies to hit 1999, it's about knowing who your true friends are and spending one last adventure before it's too late, where Eric doesn't realize this until I think mid way through. Each of the characters find out who they are, and they too can follow their dreams no matter how big or ridiculous, Windows finally see Zoe for who she is not just a best friend but deep down actually loves her, it's reciprocal, and Hutch follows his dreams of opening an Automotive Detailing Business.

Anyways hilarity ensues when they stop in Iowa the birth place of one James Tiberius Kirk, and Hutch gets into a fight with a bunch of Trekkies, one played by Seth Rogen, who also plays a pimp in Vegas. And when they do reach Skywalker ranch they run into some very animated Security Guards played by Will Arnett, and Craig Robinson. With More cameos by Shatner, Carrie Fischer, Billy Dee Williams, Kevin Smith.

This film is funny, and heartwarming (kind of odd for this type, some will argue it should of been a straight up comedy/ road trip movie, why the downer of having a character with a Terminal Illness and all, it still worked in my opinion).... Saw this will be released on Blu Ray... hopefully with some decent Special Features.... over all any Star Wars fan, hell, any movie fan will enjoy this who likes comedy and a good laugh.",1274486400,,3050,4.5926605504587155

It is really too bad that the film didn't have a bigger theater release, as it would be alot of fun to be in a theater with other Star War fans.

3396125,2,B0016MJ6GA,"This might come off rather odd but this film makes me regret being a sci-fi fan in some ways, more so in my liking of the Star Wars franchise. The problem with this film isn't the story, the story itself is actually not to bad. The problem comes from the characters and the truly awful script.

The character's are pretty generic for a ""geek"" comedy. You have your normal guy, your over-the-edge geek insecure guy, your hot babe, your over-the-edge geek funny guy, etc. It's a safe cast, but definitely not memorable, because they are so generic. Each character viewed separately seem to be the right fit for the movie, but when they are all put together, they seem to not work to well together. As you watch the movie, it feels like each character bounces off of each other instead of having a free flowing dialog, which can make the movie a little irritating to watch (and listen to) at times.

As I had mentioned before, the story itself is not to bad. The story centered around the pre-release of Episode I when a group of Star Wars fans trying to break into Skywalker Ranch in order to steal a copy of Star Wars: Episode I for their dying friend who won't live long enough to see it in theaters when it is released. They run into quirky set backs along the way but basically you already know the ending result. As I had mentioned, it is not a bad story by far, but it is also not a very memorable one.

By far the worst part of this movie is the script. As you can imagine, a movie about Star Wars fans is going to be riddled with Star Wars one-liners. This movie is filled with those one-liners to the point of narcissism. No character can go one sentence without saying some kind of reference pertaining to Star Wars in some way. It's not to bad at the beginning, but when you hear these one-liners for about an hour, they start getting old REALLY FAST! The script starts loosing its touch and you start to cringe whenever you hear a Star Wars reference. Honestly, being a Star Wars fan myself since childhood, I started to seriously question myself if I sound like them, and I hoped to God Almighty that I didn't.

I can understand the attraction one might have in seeing this movie. Majority of our generation grew up watching Star Wars and have some sort of bond with the films, thus making us all 'FanBoys' to some degree, but do not feel any kind of duty to watch this film. This movie was not made 'for FanBoys', it was made by actors portraying to 'be FanBoys' to an obnoxious degree. It's not the worst movie you will ever see, but it more than likely will be one of the most irritating.",1261440000,4,2602,4.358762886597938
3396126,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I'd only had an inkling of the massive production quagmire that this movie went through [..], but when I finally saw the movie on DVD I was astonished that it wasn't promoted properly.  ""Fanboys"" barely cracked the 500,000 dollar mark, and it could have easily made a few million.

Now, it's not a great film, but it's a very enjoyable movie.  Granted, I had no expectations, but I was still very pleasantly surprised at how funny it was and how much I liked the characters.  As others have mentioned, it's not a deep meditation on the meaning of geekdom like ""High Fidelity"" or ""Galaxy Quest"", but it's lots of fun.

It does have a very slapdash quality to it, but what road movie doesn't?  I enjoyed the whole entire movie, but the closing line doubled my appreciation.  If you're a fan of the original films, but not of the new ones, you'll have fun.  Some beers wouldn't hurt!

3396130,5,B0016MJ6GA,"Don't listen to the critics on this one, Fanboys did exactly what it set out to do; it had its share of flaws, but in the end it's a fun, somewhat-vulgar, road trip romp full of geektastic in-jokes and more random cameos than a Kevin Smith movie (including Kevin himself).
Those familiar with the long, arduous production this movie had to deal with will know just how long we had to wait, and while I think the original cut (before 'Darth' Weinstein decided it wasn't mainstream enough and tried to butcher it before it was even finished) would have been a better movie, it still accomplishes it's simple goal.
Fanboys is the story of Eric, Linus, Hutch, and Windows, four of the most life-long, die-hard and dedicated Starwoids you've ever met. These are the nerds who drive around in an elaborately-tricked-out Star Wars van (Bucephalus), know literally every bit of Star Wars or geek-related trivia out there, and spend their free time playing the video games, reading the comics, watching and reenacting the movies and discussing the most seemingly-insignificant of Star Wars details more passionately than any presidential debate. For these guys, Star Wars is a way of life, and more importantly, the bond that has glued four incredibly different friends together for life... whether they like it or not.
Eric Bottler knows this all too well; see, three years ago, he decided that Dad was right and he needed to grow up and move on. So he got a job at his father's used car dealership and began climbing the ranks, letting his friends (and Star Wars) fall to the wayside. It's now 1999, six months to go until the release of the Phantom Menace, and Eric's betrayal of the Wars was especially hard on Linus, Eric's best friend, and partner-in-crime; not only had Linus and Eric planned for years to start their own comic book and become geektastic stars in their own right, but not long after Eric bails on them, he's diagnosed with cancer. And with his expiration date looming closer and closer, it's become apparent that Linus very well might be gone by the time the movie hits theaters. Still, he stubbornly refuses to even tell Eric about his illness, and Eric is still disgusted with his friends' immaturity. But the other half of the dynamic quad won't let them end things on this note. Hopelessly awkward Windows and fat, irritating Hutch take matters into their own hands, spilling Linus' secret and prompting an apologetic, deeply unhappy, and even deeper-in-denial Eric to suggest one crazy idea that's been festering in the back of all their minds since the fifth grade: road trip it to northern California, and break into Skywalker Ranch, this time to find an advanced copy of the new movie so Linus can see it before he dies.
The road trip follows the usual formula of random things happening in random places, with plenty of Star Wars twists, of course; Hutch takes the guys on a detour to Riverside, Iowa to mock Trekkies; Bucephalus breaks down and the boys are forced to brave a bar full of gay bikers in order to fix it; Windows meets his internet dreamgirl, only to find Rogue Leader isn't who she seems; they get arrested and bailed out by gal pal, Zoe; there's a hilarious incident with a pair of hookers and their pimp in Vegas, where our heroes once more run into Admiral Seascholz and his crew of ""Trekkers"".
Considering the miniscule budget the production had to work with (the movie would probably never have been made without random fans popping out of the woodwork and offering themselves for use as extras, or their stuff for set dressings), it's actually rather impressive. They also managed to gather a group of some of the most underrated twenty-something actors around. And who can forget the cameos; of the direct Star Wars camp, Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), and Ray Park (Darth Maul) all make an appearance. William Shatner shows up as the boys' Vegas contact, and Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News is given a send-up (Harry himself was unable to actually play himself in the movie). And Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) and a slew of others have a scene or two.
According to most of the critics, the gang's opinion of Phantom Menace should be the point of the movie (more importantly, the gang's negative opinion, because apparently no one is allowed to actually like it). If you're only watching for Episode One-bashing, don't bother; as Linus so directly puts it, ""this wasn't about the movie... this was about all of us."" And if you're there to mock the fanboy (or girl), you'll be disappointed as well. This is a celebration of the fanboy, and all that he (or she) stands for. On the other hand, it could be argued that it's not even really about Star Wars; it's about brotherhood; about never giving up on your dreams, or your friends; and never letting anyone tell you that you're too... whatever, for the stuff you love.
Thoroughly recommended, as long as you don't go into it expecting it to be more than what it is. Non-Starwoids might be a little lost, but don't let that scare you away; there's plenty of stupid, vulgar, non-geek humor, too (I'll let you decide if that's a good or bad thing).",1260489600,,5204,4.726072607260726
3396131,4,B0016MJ6GA,"But I was very surprised with how good ""Fanboys"" really turned out.  The film was mired in production difficulties, re-edits, storyline changes, etc. for many months and I expected it to be nothing more than a shell of the original idea by the time it hit the theaters and/or DVD shelf.  However, at its core, ""Fanboys"" manages to be a very funny (especially if you are a science fiction geek) nod to real fanboys with a decent amount of heart thrown in for good measure.

The story centers on four friends.  The somewhat estranged Bottler (Sam Huntington) has grown-up and become a responsible car salesman for his father despite dreaming of becoming a comic book artist.  The rest of the gang, however, are trapped in their own ""immature"" world of ""Star Wars,"" comic books and a general hatred of ""Star Trek"" fans.  The fanatical Hutch (Dan Fogler) runs a struggling comic book shop with Windows (Jay Baruchel), an uber-nerd who's socially awkward.  Chris Marquette fill out the group as Linus, who has recently found out that he has roughly four months to live.

Linus' cancer draws Bottler back into the group and they decide to break into Skywalker Ranch in order to steal a rough cut of the upcoming ""Episode I--The Phantom Menace"" so that Linus can see it before he dies.  What follows is an unevenly humorous adventure scattered with multiple inside jokes (some obvious, others not so much) pointed at Star Wars, Star Trek and science fiction in general as well as a number of cameos.

The best moments are those involving interactions with with Trek fans and the actual break in attempt at Skywalker Ranch.  The group finds themselves in jail while on their journey, and are bailed out by Zoe (Kristen Bell), a worker from Hutch's comic shop.  She joins them for the rest of their adventure and provides a much needed ""punky"" boost to the film.

All of the characters are mirrored from either characters or plotlines from the original ""Star Wars"" films.  Much like the inside jokes, some of these parallels are very obvious and others aren't.  The film does falter a bit at times as far as humor is concerned, but it is an overall enjoyable experience.

The DVD comes with a nice helping of extras.  I'm not a big fan of in-film commentary, but I must admit that the commentary provided by the cast and crew of ""Fanboys"" is a highlight of the special features this time around.  There are also deleted scenes, webisodes, and other tidbits that I'm sure most ""Star Wars"" fans will enjoy.

In all honesty, this film only registers three stars when viewed by general audiences.  Science fiction fans will probably enjoy it to a much higher degree and therefore I gave it four stars.  Is it for everybody? Nope, but if you are a real fanboy, you have probably already decided whether or not you want to watch this film.  I personally recommend it to ""Star Wars"" fans.

3396139,3,B0016MJ6GA,"Fanboys: 5 out of 10: The back-story behind this film is much more interesting than what appears on the screen. It seems in a galaxy far far away the evil Harvey 'Darth' Weinstein wanted to cut out the main plot of this movie. (Kid dying of cancer wants to see Star Wars Episode One before he dies.) The rebel alliance (Director Kyle Newman) fought a guerilla battle against Harvey and won so the film is now released with the Linus dying of cancer subplot intact.

Well, since the movie itself seems too conveniently ignore the Linus cancer plot at regular intervals, (Chris Marquette who plays Linus looks like he is about to run a triathlon rather than someone with a fatal illness. He is like a male Ali McGraw) one can be excused to ponder what the hubbub was about.

In actuality the cancer subplot was the second most ridiculous story line in the film with the first being Sam Huntington's quest to not inherit his fathers 12 car dealerships... cause becoming a multimillionaire overnight means abandoning your dreams of drawing comic books?

Fanboys is funny in spots and has some great performances including Kristen Bell as the perfect geek girl and Dan Fogler who is the spiritual reincarnation of Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Revenge of the Nerds) and great cameos including William Shatner.

The main leads (Marquette and Huntington) are charisma free drips however and the movie suffers from an overall sloppiness. For example it takes place in 1998 yet is chock full of items that simply did not exist back then (IMDB has a nice list here). Getting the poster of Darth Vader wrong, (It is the version from Episode 3) or having a scene in a comic book store with modern comics visible on the shelves seems like small things. However, this is a movie for fanboys. If there is one group that would notice such sloppiness it is they.

Overall a hit or miss road comedy with a Star Wars veneer, Fanboys is well meaning but not really worth the time.",1256083200,,1960,4.6695652173913045

As a self-professed sci-fi geek, I really appreciated the story and humor in the movie.  The Star Wars references, sound effects especially, were hilarious.  There were several cameos that just made you laugh.  The storyline was interesting, taking place about 6 months prior to the release of Phantom Menace.  The actors were great too.  They came off as complete Star Wars geeks in the movie - it was great.

My only warnings - The humor is crude at times, so if you don't like crude humor, you might want to stay away.  And very important - I do NOT recommend this for anyone under the age of 13.  I have 3 kids, ages 8, 9 & 10, who love Star Wars.  They've seen Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest, both spoofs of the great movie.  They, however, will not be seeing this one until they are older.  There are adult themes and activities that aren't appropriate for that age.",1255046400,,1141,4.392344497607655

That alone grants it an extra star.  There are a lot of ""in"" jokes that are purely for the fanboys of the world.  This movie had a roller coaster ride to finally getting released on DVD and if you are a fun a Star Wars or have ever been a HUGE fan for any sci-fi movie/TV show/comic etc, then you should support your fellow fans and give this flick a try.",1254700800,,506,4.13265306122449
3396142,5,B0016MJ6GA,"This movie is hilarious.

I also found it to be a heartfelt and honest portrayal of obsessive Star Wars fans. This feeling was shared by my wife and the other couple in my home audience. We busted many guts throughout.

This is a teenage road trip movie. It's one of the best ones I've seen. In addition, it has more heart than the average one as it's about friends trying to fulfill the wish of a friend who is dying rather than about trying to get laid. However, the movie isn't about being sad about death, it's about fulfilling dreams. The humor isn't impaired at all.

I read some negative/critical reviews here on Amazon before I watched it, but I disagree with them after having seen the film. If the movie itself had made fun of the characters, it would have made this film shallow and removed the charm of the characters. The humor in the film works great without making of fun of the characters for their single-minded nature. Their idiosyncrasies is what gives them their charm and personality.

You don't have to be an obsessive sci-fi geek to love this movie (though having seen Star Wars would definitely be a plus).",1254700800,,1130,4.551724137931035

Linus was the terminally ill friend, not Eric (he was the heir to the used car dealership). And Kirk's fictional hometown was in Iowa not Ohio. The boys were driving from their hometown in Ohio. Please... if you're going to review a movie, please at least pay some attention to it, especially if you're an ""official"" Amazon reviewer.

Any way, I found the movie very touching. There were a few scenes that were a bit over the top, but overall I think it captured the essence of being a true Star Wars fan. By the way I found the last line of the movie to be one of the best lines ever.",1254182400,,720,4.294117647058823
3396144,2,B0016MJ6GA,"I had heard that this was a creative and unpolished roadtrip movie, and given the subject matter of star wars fanboyism, I just had to see for myself. From the first few minutes I found my hopes a little deflated by the bad acting, cliche' screen play writing, and farce-laden comedy that seemed out of place with the film's obvious attempt to build a real story around real characters for which I was expected to invest some level of emotional involvement. That deflated enthusiasm was never restored, and continued to errode as the movie wore on. The characters (and their ""issues"") were cardboard cut-outs with predictable over-reactions, arguments, and the like. The plot movement felt more like a shakey waggon with loosely tied luggage falling off at every bump than the solid, streamlined plot development of a well done movie. There were a few moments that were well done and enjoyable, but they were like dull jewels that seemed to get swept under the rug by another offense by the time you had dusted them off well enough to enjoy the glow. The counterpart to this film that 'did it right' would be ""High Fidelity"" which mastered the art of depicting fanboys in their element of geekdom while at the same time painting a genuine story with believable characters. Ditto with Galaxy Quest (which is coming to Blu-ray at long last). Watch either High Fidelity or Galaxy Quest if you'd like to watch this concept set to film the right way.

3396155,5,B0016MJ6GA,"Four twenty-something childhood friends with a shared obsession for the greatest movie trilogy of all-time (Star Wars, for the clueless), reunite for the ultimate mission: To travel cross-country to George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of ""Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" to view months before its official release. There's an honorable cause driving their madness though, as the group's most heartfelt member, Linus, is terminal with cancer and may not live to see the film otherwise. Together with rambunctious scoundrel Hutch (who drives a Star Wars fan's dream-van) and uber-nerd Windows, Linus and his ""straying from the Force"" best-friend, Eric, set out on the trip of a lifetime in search of their own, personal Death Star.

As the motley crew of rebels makes its way on the open road, naturally, they have a series of mishaps and misadventures. (*Mild Spoilers*) Their distaste for Trekkies leads them to a confrontation at a Captain Kirk statue dedication in Iowa. Soon after, they accidentally stumble into the wrong biker bar, have a strange experience with some marijuana-laced guacamole, Windows finally meets his internet dreamgirl, and an encounter with Harry Knowles of ""Ain't It Cool News"" sends them to Vegas for a secret meeting with a Skywalker Ranch insider, but not before they land themselves in jail and have to get bailed out by the comic shop hottie with a crush on one of the guys. Of course, it all leads up to one crazy infiltration attempt on Skywalker Ranch and a very touching finale.

So, that's the story of ""Fanboys"", quite simply, a film made for lovers of all-things Star Wars. Trekkies, beware; while this film may have some moments you'd enjoy, it definitely mocks the Trek. If you don't have a good sense of humor or acknowledge the fact that Star Wars is superior, you may just want to pick up a copy of ""Free Enterprise"" instead. Great film, but it's the Trek version of ""Fanboys"". ""Free Enterprise"" is more original and intellectual, and I love it because it goes beyond just Trek, but I gotta say, as a diehard, lifelong Star Wars fanatic, it made me anxious for something like ""Fanboys"" to come along.

Of course, ""Fanboys"" isn't perfect. The road-trip mission plot is anything but new, and the weak spots are some of those aforementioned misadventures. Two in particular come to mind. The gay biker bar bit seemed uninspired, though I liked the parallel with the Mos Eisley Cantina, and all the stuff right after that involving ""The Chief"" seemed rushed and awkward (don't get me wrong, who doesn't love Danny Trejo?). In general, there were times of missed opportunities to make things just a bit funnier. On the upside though, the film is still wholly enjoyable thanks to all the clever things that are included, mostly being Star Wars references, terrific cameos, and the humor of having a pop-culture obsession, thankfully treated here with total respect; something else that makes this a great film. ""Fanboys"" also has a great cast of rising stars, with Chris Marquette of ""Just Friends"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain"" as Linus, Sam Huntington of ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and ""Superman Returns"" as Eric, Dan Fogler from ""Balls of Fury"" as Hutch, Jay Baruchel of ""Tropic Thunder"" as Windows, Seth Rogan in multiple and hilarious roles, and the gorgeously stunning as always Kristen Bell as Zoe, the feisty comic shop princess. And, yes, girls like that do exist. There isn't one at my local comic shop, but I've seen them working the shop booths at Wizard World Texas(R.I.P.). I'll always remember a particularly cute one I saw the past two years from a comic shop in Plano. Though, I don't buy the filmmakers' implication that girls like that go unnoticed by the geeks around them because their interests make them ""one of the guys"". Nah, those girls are usually dating one of the comic shop employees, that's the problem, but I digress...

Yes, as I mentioned, one of the things that makes ""Fanboys"" great is that it treats the fans with respect (of course, that's what some critics seem to have had a problem with). It even cleverly handles the whole controversy of Episode 1 being... not good. Which is not my own opinion, just a seemingly popular one. In addition, the plot point of Linus's terminal condition adds a great depth to the whole thing that was nearly lost. Apparently, executive producer Harvey Weinstein wanted that left on the cutting room floor. Thank the Force that didn't happen. Fascinating that Director Kyle Newman seems to have gotten a taste of the very Dark Side George Lucas himself grew disgusted of having to deal with in Hollywood. And, before I forget to mention it, another very clever aspect of the film are the parallels with the Star Wars saga and its characters. It's not simple or overly in your face, thank goodness, as the characters even trade roles sometimes in terms of the parallels. Though, there's no question who Princess Leia is, and it's a shame she wears the gold bikini so briefly...

The DVD of ""Fanboys"" (currently, unfortunately, frustratingly, inexplicably not available on Blu in the U.S. at the time of this review) presents the film in widescreen with a PG-13 rating. It's nice to see a modern, 20-something roadtrip movie with a PG-13 rating, and I'm especially glad since Star Wars appeals to a wide age-range. Though, in all honesty, the PG-13 rating is misused these days. The crude humor (at least some of which I hear was producer-demanded in this case, though it's thankfully not excessive) is not something I'd call appropriate for 13 year-olds, ha. If memory serves, the PG-13 rating was created to deal more with violence than sexual and drug references, but now it seems to allow a very inappropriate amount of said material under its mantle. For such content, PG-15 or 16 would make more sense. But, hey, I don't really care that much, as I'm not a teen nor a parent. I just find it an interestingly disturbing thing what is officially considered acceptable for 13 year-olds these days. I prefer to avoid the whole issue and get ""unrated"" versions myself when available, ha. That way, it doesn't matter what your age is. Anyway, the DVD serves up a nice little collection of extras. We get deleted scenes (including the cut William Katt cameo; I wonder why they reshot that), a very entertaining and enlightening cast and crew commentary, a handful of behind the scenes featurettes and some behind-the-scenes webisodes as well. It's a shame they didn't try to get Lucas to let them put the Star Wars Holiday Special on there too.

So, I guess that's about it. ""Fanboys"" is not perfect, but it's still definitely great overall and thoroughly appreciated by myself and I suspect legions of others. However, if you're not a Star Wars fan, it might not do anything for you at all. It's probably not totally crucial to enjoyment of the film, but it certainly must help greatly. If you ARE a Star Wars fan though, definitely get this film. It's a MUST OWN!",1251158400,3,6997,4.841269841269841
3396156,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I have to start with a question: is there some law that says that every comedy made today has to have an unfunny fat guy in it? Dan Folger is one of the least funny people I've ever seen on film. I mean, spectacularly unfunny. Yet he was front and center in this film. I know it was because he had been in the spectacularly unfunny BALLS OF FURY. The equally unfunny Seth Rogen seems to be in nearly all of these films as well. There must be some people out there who find these guys, or others like him, like Jonah Hill. But of all the unfunny fat guys populating movies today, the worst is Dan Folger. Doubt me? Watch GOOD LUCK CHUCK. Though Dane Cook did the yeoman's work in making that one a stinker, Folger's scenes took the film to a whole new level of awful. And not only did this movie have Folger at his near worse, it also had Seth Rogen in three whole roles, each one less funny than the next. When I talk to friends about how awful these guys are, I get nothing but passionate agreement. I've yet to see someone who thinks either Dan Folger or Seth Rogen is funny. Oh, I know some people online say that, but none of my real life friends can stand them. So about one and a half of the stars that were removed in my review are due to Dan Folger and Seth Rogen.

Folger and Rogen aside, I had fun watching this. There were some good jokes, many of them pretty nerdy in jokes, and a number of pretty pleasant moments. The only huge negatives were Folger and Rogen. Well, and possibly that there was less Kristen Bell than there could have been. She is largely absent in the first half of the film, but enlivened the second half. I also enjoyed seeing Jay Baruchel in the film. I haven't seen a great deal of him since the lamentably short run of UNDECLARED. The movie has a couple of nice cameos from William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams to represent both the STAR WARS and STAR TREK universes. And Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes have a very brief, but relatively funny, cameo.

There is a bit of a story -- a road trip by four guys (one of them terminally ill) in 1998 to go to Skywalker Ranch in California to steal the rough cut of the new THE PHANTOM MENACE -- but this is just a loose skeleton to hand a host of cultural references. If you hate popular culture and Sci-fi, you probably will hate this movie. A lot of the fun of the film is working through all the references, including the inevitable Boba Fett nod. All in all it is a fun film. If only Dan Folger had not been in the film it might have been a good one. Still, if you enjoy films about nerds, you should get a kick out of this.",1250380800,,2623,4.161417322834645

The film has a good message, which is seldom seen in a lot of the recent sex-based comedies.  It's about friendship and sticking together.

If that were the case I would have been forced to sit and waste more time than the hour or so watching this that I did without the option of blissfully turning it off.

Star Wars obsessed fans waste time doing things that are so tired and obviously have been taken from other buddy roadtrip/fraternity/partying movies that have been made. All while being under the umbrella of a wanna-be meaningful ""Make a Dream"" foundation premise. In my opinion what the makers of this movie didn't get was that the same group they were marketing to don't need a Star Wars theme-they just watch their DodgeBall, Van Wilder, Benchwarmers, Year One and Rob Schneider movies for the same effect. That effect- nerds, geeks, losers, lazy moochers off society can have fun, get into some CRAZY predicaments and get girls too.

Kevin Smith and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog did it well-this did not. This one was just plain bad.

After many years of it being pushed around and forgotten about it was released to theaters in limited viewing, a few months later its out on DVD.  Not too surprising.  The film itself is rather boring.  The only reason I would suggest watching the movie is for the brief scene with Kevin Smith and Jason Mews.  There is an easy walk around that you can go to the deleted scenes and watch and extended cut of the scene.",1245456000,6,565,4.3428571428571425

I don't laugh aloud a lot when watching movies, usually just a little smirk and a soft ""ha."" I was laughing aloud with this one. It was great straight to the last line.
If you care about this sort of thing, it did get pretty dirty here and there.

3396177,4,B0016MJ6GA,"then let me ease your mind, the movie is funny. it is serious in parts,but it helps us to get to know the characters more. anyone who love star wars, either old or new trilogies. Anyone who gets the reason why lucas released episode IV first...anyone who has ever read comics or ever had heated discussions over who shot first han or greedo..then this movie is for you. You do not have to know every single line of every lucas film or every ""geek movie"" to get the jokes, some are implied jokes which means even if you don't know the subject they are making fun of, the joke is more or less universal. Of course the more you know the better the movie is. such as the security at skywalker ranch being dressed as THX cops. not sure what they were called in that film though. Anyway the person writing the review of this movie doesn't get it. (the product description etc) this is a movie for those who love the movies and love the whole idea of an ""event movie"" star wars wasn't just about the movies themselves it was about the friends we made while waiting in line, or the conversations you had at the toy store with other people who watched the movie. This movie is funny in a way that's not forced on us. Meaning the jokes come naturally as any would in our day to day conversations, nothing is forced or thrown in your face, it's all pretty much there as it would be in every day life. Someone compared this to Kevin Smith's humor. That is pretty close to what you get here. The dialogue drive a lot of the humor and the situations of course are absurd, but that's what you expect in comedy. If you did like the humor of those Kevin Smith films especially Clerks and Mallrats you will love what is in this movie. Too bad Jay and silent Bob didn't have a bigger part. Even casual fans of sci-fi will love the humor and you don't have to be a star wars junkie or a trekkie to enjoy the scenes between the star wars and star trek fans. and the cameo of William Shatner was priceless. Though I was half expecting a priceline comment considerring what he helped them with in the film, though that may be a legal reason why he didn't mention it. This movie is great fun and it's at a great price. So just get it and enjoy. Be warned though the humor isn't for everyone in the family. Some humor is more adult in nature. But it should be fine for the will farrel/adam sandler crowd.",1245110400,,2379,4.253863134657837
3396178,1,B0016MJ6GA,I had been waiting the release of this movie sense I first heard about it back in 2006. It finally comes out and I am seriously disappointed.

To quote his review: ""the guards look like characters Lucas might have considered for either of the two trilogies"". He is talking about the guards in THX-1138 costumes - an ""inside"" joke that probably only die-hard Lucas fans will understand. That pretty much sums up this movie. If you are a true Fanboy or Fangirl, you'll get all of the references and parallels and I think you'll get a lot more out of this movie than other people. If you aren't a Star Wars fan, there just isn't enough plot left over to keep you hanging in there.",1244764800,2,637,4.547826086956522

It sort of just 'came and went' until I saw a reference to it the other day. I looked it up on Amazon and it was available so I bought it.

I'm really glad I did.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.

I grew up when Star Wars first came out, so seeing all the 'inside jokes' and the cameos in the film was a real treat.
I watched it again with my girlfriend a few days later and enjoyed it just as much as the first time.

The jokes are pretty goofy but I expected them from this kind of film.
Nothing terribly original in them, but they are executed well.

It's a fun popcorn flick and if you're hip to Star wars (or know any rabid fans), it's definitely worth watching.

I gave it 4-stars because hey, it ain't Shakespeare.
If you're expecting Oscar-winning performances, then maybe you should just pass on this. Otherwise I really recommend it.",1244764800,,968,4.239130434782608
3396181,4,B0016MJ6GA,"I have watched this twice on DVD. Unfortunately it did not hit the big screens here in Australia, so I only see it at home. In a word - hilarious! I think that this is the ultimate tribute film to Star Wars.
I would have liked to have seen a feature length version of Kevin Rubio's ""Troops"" but this is the next best thing. Choc full of cameos by veteran Star Wars actors, Kevin Smith, Jason Mews and unforgatable roles by Seth Rogan. If you don't know what this is about, basically it is a road trip movie with four Star Wars Fans plus a girl determined to break into Skywalker ranch to see a ""rough cut"" version of ""Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" so that one of them can see it before he dies of terminal cancer. Although not much is made of the cancer tradgedy and you can tell from the editing that this is not meant to be a focal point of the movie, it could've been; instead it heavily relies on endless Star Wars references and Satr Wars related sight gags. If more was made of the cancer tradgedy then it would have added to the drama significantly. If you hate Star Wars (I feel sorry for you), then this movie is not for you, you will not get many of the jokes. If you love Star Wars then I am certain you will at the very least find this a fun ride. My favourite line is the very last one of the movie. I won't ruin it for you but it sums up how we all felt in 1999. I just wish this movie actually came out around several years ago when the world was in the grip of main stream Star Wars mania, not just the fans. Time will tell if it becomes a cult classic. I hope so",1244505600,,1591,4.0062893081761
3396182,4,B0016MJ6GA,"Enjoy a moment with family by watching this ""based on true facts"" of Star Wars geeks! If you are a SW geek/fan this is a must see!",1244505600,,130,3.8518518518518516
3396183,3,B0016MJ6GA,"Yes, this film was supposed to come out two years ago.  Yes, it was reshot and had a hard time in test screenings.  Yes, it's from the Weinstein company, who are now notorious, even when they were with Miramax, for fiddling with a movie so much that it barely resembles the project it was intended to be before filming began.  Yes, it got a very limited theatrical run but ultimately became a direct to video release.  And yes, I absolutely don't care.  I'm just going to review this dvd based on the film presented.

The film is called Fanboys, but it's not really a comedic dissection of these loley outcasts and their obssessions.  It's just about some Star Wars fanboys who go on a trek to see Episode I nine months early for their friend who has a 'terminal disease'.  Unfortunately, this film uses the dying friend as a plot device rather then anything meaningful.  They don't even have the balls to name what 'terminal disease' the boy has.  From what the movie presents us with, it can't be that bad, the kid looks pretty healthy, and if it's some form of cancer, he's quite mobile and active.  I hate, HATE, when movies use a 'disease' for cheap sentimental reactions from the more simple in the audience, and it's even worse when you can tell the writer's can't even hide the fact that they don't take the concept seriously or even elaborate on it in anything remotely insightful.

Sure, many will claim, ""It's just a screw-ball comedy, what'd you expect Gone With The Wind?""  Those who say that need to raise their expectations so maybe in the future Hollywood will release more quality films that have a chance of lasting beyond the opening weekend grosses.  This movie would've benefited from dropping the dying friend altogether or creatively mingling the plot line into the narrative in a funny and honest way.  Death doesn't always have to be presented as a ship sinker.  Terms of Endearment is a very funny film that is also very sad.  It can be done.  The dying friend is simply a cheap ploy to illicit undeserved emotinal responses from viewers, and from looking at the Amazon reviews for this film, it worked to a degree.  How very sad.

Okay, enough bitching.  I give the three star rating because the things that work in the film really work and made me laugh and smile.  The characters are distinct enough and have enough funny schtick to entertain.  I used to consider myself a real movie nerd, until I met too many real fanboys.  They ruin everything.  They make everything narrow and in a vaccuum.  I know as much about the subject of film as them, but manage to keep my priorities straight.  They're really lame.  The fanboys in this film are filtered down versions of the geeks that really exist.  In other words their tolerable and relatable to a degree.

The film has some great cameos that illicit many laughs.  Especially, the great Seth Roegen in the duel roles of a Trek nerd and a Star Wars nerd who happens to also be a Las Vegas pimp.  Shatner shows up All The President's Men style and steals the whole movie, as usual.  The gags and jokes are sophmoric but funny.  The actors work over time to sell all the moments.  Plus, you have to be somewhat of a geek to get a lot of the jokes.  Who else, outside the movie biz, would actually know who and what Harry Knowles looks like?  Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams show up, but add nothing funny to the film oddly enough, considering the film revolves around the mythos of the films that made both of them famous.

The dvd is loaded.  There's a very funny and informative commentary track by the cast and director, it's more entertaining then the actual film.  Of course the issue of the film's troubled history is mostly avoided.  We also get some deleted scenes that were rightfully deleted.  The making of features are mostly fluff.  Just cast and crew blowing smoke and giving nothing insightful, though they all come off and as good intentioned as their movie counterparts.

The movie is worth a rent.  It has many funny moments, but the whole sentimental side of the film really collapses this thing from becoming a comedy classic.  The tone is so off.  One moment it's Road Trip and the next it's a cheesy and undemanding 'special' episode of Full House.",1244419200,2,4250,4.583001328021249

If the subject matter wasn't something that I hold near and dear to my heart I would have stopped viewing this movie half way through. There is nothing special about anything in this film other than the Star Wars connection. The main actors are just average, the direction is film student level, with a script that has to rely far too often on childish slapstick instead of genuine comedy. This movie is just basically watered down little bits of every gag and every punch line you've already seen in dozens and dozens of other movies. Yes, it's apparent that the director is a movie fan but I didn't see anything that would make me believe he has anything unique to offer. There are a few redeeming moments in this film but far too many comedy cliches regurgitated from other films that did it so much better.
It's too bad Seth Rogen and Keven Smith had small roles in the movie instead of being the writer and director.

With a touching plot and many special cameo appearances, this film was definitely what the Star Wars fan in me has been craving for so long. This is a must-see for any diehard Star Wars fan! I really enjoyed the touching storyline that lie beneath the humorous antics: one being the dying wish of a friend, and the other being about following your heart and, as Joseph Campbell would say, ""following your way to bliss"" rather than simply settle for a life that you don't love or enjoy.

As I said, the Star Wars references are plenty and there is even a big mention of the unspoken rivalry between Star Wars fans and Trekkies -- I'm sorry -- Trekkers. Of course, there was a big dispute between fanboys of this film and its producer (Harvey Weinstein) as to whether the subplot of the dying friend should be included or re-edited. In the end, thankfully, the fans won and the storyline remained. I think it's a better movie for it. Otherwise, it's just another piece of Star Wars memomorablia to add to the shelves. My only complaint with ""Fanboys"" is that the easily-lovable Kristen Bell doesn't have as big a part as I would've liked and the story could've explored more into the friendship between Huntington and Marquette's friendship (i.e. what exactly drove them apart). Still, for what this movie is - a quick, wacky comedy with heart - it is good enough to earn a spot on my DVD shelves. After all, c'mon, man! It's the Wars!!!",1242777600,,1692,4.621262458471761

If you are not that much into Star Wars (because you were born too late, or are ""weird"" ;-)), there is still a great deal of comedy for this flic to be a pleasant ride. Hope you have a blast! Maybe then we can get some more made...

------------------------------------
It's geeky guest-star cameos galore in this pop-culture mega-farce about four - no, wait, five! -- Star Wars fans from Ohio who live out their fifth-grade dream of breaking into George Lucas' Marin County ranch in order to see a ""sneak peak"" of Episode One of the Star Wars films. It's a road trip flick packed with pop-culture references and nerd humor, as well as appearances by folks such as Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith & Jason Mewes, Billy Dee Willams, Carrie Fisher and --gasp!!-- William Shatner. It's pretty funny, if a bit strained at times... Mostly, it's familiar, and comforting in a way, like an old friend whose just showed up at your door and needs a place to crash for a month or two.  The THX-1138 references at the end are especially welcome. Funny and fun!",1242604800,,835,4.921985815602837
3396198,3,B0016MJ6GA,"I really liked Fanboys except for one thing... the movie uses genuine Star Wars props and costumes all over the place, and yet it dresses up the Star Trek fans in ridiculous parodies of the correct costumes.

I could really care less that they portray the fans themselves as they do, but why the goofy wrong uniforms and props for the Trek people?

If they were asked, it's likely that Paramount denied the filmmakers permission to use the correct items.  If I had been the filmmakers in that position, I would have thrown up a big title page at the start of the movie saying so. The filmmakers have to be aware that an awful lot of Star Wars fans are *also* Trek fans, and vice versa.  The militant division between the two depicted by the movie is the exception, not the rule.  So why alienate people (pun intended)?

Ok... maybe there was one other thing I didn't like.  Not nearly enough Kristin Bell!",1242604800,,905,4.4817073170731705

I first saw this movie at Comic-con San Diego last year after waiting in line for several hours to score a pass to it. And I LOVED IT! It was hilarious, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. But the title really fits the movie, because it was a story about fans, about the die-hard, obsessed fans that most people mock, but the ones who shape and define their lives by what they love the most. The writers perfectly balanced the comedy, the sentimental plot of a true fan who wasn't going to live long enough to see the new SW movie, and the inside look at what ""fanboys"" really are like.

The only problem I have with the movie is that there are so many inside jokes and references to the series that non-fans wouldn't understand. But, then, the movie really seems to be targeted towards SW fans in particular, so there's not a huge loss I would guess. But if you've never seen a SW movie (and *gasp*, what's wrong with you? Get yourself to a Blockbuster ASAP!), you'll probably be lost at various points throughout the movie.

Anyway, you have probably known people like this if you are not a fanboy/fangirl yourself.  In reality, everyone has something they're into, some hobby or interest to displace boredom.

I digress.  I thought this movie was the funniest I had seen in a long time.  What really struck me about this movie was how even after seeing the previews the movie was still funny.  The trailers didn't give everything away either.  Too many times in the last couple years have movies, especially blockbusters, been so awful that I considered just not watching another new movie again, ever.
