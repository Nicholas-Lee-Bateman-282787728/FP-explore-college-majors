8194543,5,B000MMLPIW,"Shinichi Watanabe (Excel Saga) has come up with a wild one this time. Daikon (radish) farmer Hideki, former model Mako and host boy Ichiro are the Nerima Daikon Brothers: A singing group that wants to build a concert dome so they can perform. Each attempt to get some money always ends in a bust for the group, and every episode is musical. True, the tunes don't seem to differ too much, but the lyrics will change depedning on the storyline. This is the (unfortunate) final volume in the series. Whenever they need instant cash, the money girls come out, singing and pushing the old ATM on our heroes. This anime is a lot of fun, and a nice followup to the manic Excel Saga. You'll find yourself humming the songs (whichever lyrics you choose).",1218153600,,745,4.567164179104478
