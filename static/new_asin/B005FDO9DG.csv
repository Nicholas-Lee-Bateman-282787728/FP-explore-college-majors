8469871,5,B005FDO9DG,This was a gift to an out of state person - am rating 5 stars for prompt delivery.  I did not see the video.,1482796800,2,108,3.5
8469872,5,B005FDO9DG,"A well produced DVD collection of vintage newsreel and military film clips.  In addition to wartime training and propaganda film footage, some clips are excerpted from early post-Second World War documentaries, and there is also captured Axis gun camera combat footage.

This DVD arrived very quickly and it came in its own case.  Campbell Films also included (at no additional charge) a second DVD, ""P-38 Reconnaissance Pilot"".  This DVD pair makes very interesting viewing for anyone with an interest in World War II aviation, in particular this oft-overlooked U.S. fighter plane.  The Lockheed P-38 was flown with distinction by Allied pilots on every major front for the entire duration of that conflict.",1343001600,5,708,5.285714285714286
