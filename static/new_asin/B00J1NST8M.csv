8647284,5,B00J1NST8M,"I take this DVD with me when I travel. It's a great option to have when I can't make it to a class.
The instructor is excellent and provides very detailed instruction on the poses.",1418688000,3,180,4.171428571428572
8647285,5,B00J1NST8M,This DVD is Awesome! You can tell this was put together by a knowledgable yoga teacher who does her fair share of riding. Including a pre and post ride routine this shortens recovery time and aids in injury prevention.  I love the beach routine!,1417737600,3,245,4.568181818181818
