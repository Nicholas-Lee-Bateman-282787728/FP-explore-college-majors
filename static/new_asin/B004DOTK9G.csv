8425848,4,B004DOTK9G,"I have been a fan of Mill Creek Entertainment for around 4 years now.  I purchased the ""End Of The World"" Documentary set at one of my favorite haunts about 2 years ago.  I enjoy most of the documentaries in this set.  Although some of them are quite hokey.  If nothing else, at the price they are selling it at, it really is a steal for all of these",1398643200,,350,4.028985507246377
8425849,4,B004DOTK9G,"Gave as a gift, I didn't watch it, so don't ask me? But it does look intersting. This sort of stuff is scary sci fi, but could happen?",1374105600,,134,3.8214285714285716
8425850,3,B004DOTK9G,"If you really think the world's about to end, I'm not sure you want to spend 34 hours of your precious time left watching films about the world ending...but since I'm pretty sure it's NOT, I don't feel bad about recommending this compilation.  We're talking ancient Mayan prophecies, Egyptian prophecies, Freemasons, Knights Templar, Nostradamus, conspiracies, aliens, time travel and other paranormal investigations.  There's so much here, the mind boggles, which is the point, I think.  Variety is the key word, maybe depth and scope.  This is actually 24 separate documentaries in about 3 or 4 different styles: lectures, reenactments, file footage under narration, graphics--all designed to tickle the imagination and question our view of the world--past, present and future (we hope).  The year 2012 is the key, of course.  I'm hoping it turns out like the whole Y2K thing, kind of a bust.  Frankly not too many of these 34 hours really address that issue, but it's a good hook, I think.  If any of this interests you, this is the place to start.",1321315200,3,1051,5.0
8425851,2,B004DOTK9G,And I didn't get much.  Inexpensive for the number of discs. Out of the 10 DVD'S about half of one of them was worth watching.  The majority of these 10 discs look like a high school lecture or maybe a cult symposium.,1302307200,,217,4.142857142857143
