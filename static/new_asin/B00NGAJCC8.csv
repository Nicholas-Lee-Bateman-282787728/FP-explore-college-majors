6649242,5,B00NGAJCC8,"True masters are able to take the most complex knowledge and make it understandable to those just beginning to learn. The teachers have created a wonderful DVD for anyone wanting to learn the underlying concepts and essential positions for the five elements. The Chinese roots of each of the elements are explained clearly and simply. There are slow, detailed explanations of each move as you watch the video so it's easy to follow along. Visualizations are added to develop the practice further. Finally, they tell you how each element can have an impact on your daily life. The second disk has workouts without verbal instructions.",1419724800,10,633,5.038095238095238
6649243,5,B00NGAJCC8,"Beautifully filmed. Intellectually may be one of the best programs on the subject available. The explanations and history are well presented and you walk away knowing more than you thought you might gain from a DVD. The two discs are broken down nicely as

DISC 1: ELEMENTS & MOVEMENTS
Explains and teaches postures, walks and massages designed to increase health and energy.  Breathing and movement combine with easy-to-follow instructions.

DISC 2: WORKOUTS  Several daily workouts are included to fit into any lifestyle.

THE 5 ELEMENTS (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal) form the cycles of life and health. Each is explained and demonstrated in inspiring natural environments by master teachers.",1415923200,12,702,5.345454545454546
6649244,5,B00NGAJCC8,This is a great place to start if you're interested in practicing Qi Gong.

8677937,3,B00NGAJCC8,This is a very informative video and it shows each of the steps individually but never all put together. It was great to learn about each part and what it means but by the time I got to the end (1.5 hours) I was hoping to see them all flowing together as a routine and see how to transition between them. There was a suggestion of different ways to do routines each day but never an actual shot of them being done together.,1511308800,,423,4.108433734939759

8677943,3,B00NGAJCC8,"I wasn't overly Impressed with this DVD. The workouts themselves are extremely short, and when I watched the explanation DVD to see how the instructors explained the positions in the workouts, there wasn't any in-depth explanation. Qi Gong can be very specific regarding hand positions, body tension, breathing, etc, and there was no discussion about this.

The workouts themselves have no verbal cues, so you're constantly looking over your shoulder to see when you need to change sides or positions. As I said, they're also extremely short; the longest is 11 minutes as I recall.  I have an instructor, so I bought this to use on days when we don't meet, so it serves some purpose if I need a quick meditative workout. Overall, it's only ok, I own better.",1446249600,3,757,4.815384615384615
8677944,5,B00NGAJCC8,"So much information presented in a gentle, non demanding way.  i have learned a lot.  one of the best things is the menu allows you to move from element to element and style your own workouts.  Very relaxing exercising and knowing what each move means sets the concepts beautifully.  highly recommended.",1436659200,5,303,4.882352941176471
8677945,5,B00NGAJCC8,"i have just started using this, but already it is the gold standard for content and presentation. if you are any kind of beginner, get this. i've been practicing a while, and this is good for me too.",1420848000,8,199,4.2631578947368425
