8617585,5,B005LSPCJU,"This movie is just EXCELLENT especially for a youth ministry. It is very compelling with the testimony of teenagers that share the way the Lord Jesus changed their lives. The teenagers involved come from different backgrounds and most of the teens today can relate with them. It is very well done especially with the ""box"" where people walk in a room and answer very thought provoking questions. It is 30 minutes, and thus perfect for teens with a short span of attention. Would highly recommend it!",1364688000,,499,4.813953488372093
