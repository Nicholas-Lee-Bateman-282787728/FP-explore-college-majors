1261346,5,B00003CWOT,"He exposes cultures and crosses the boarders in his very unique and  fantastically funny (and right on) view. I saw the video of an HBO show  starring Eddie Izzard while vacationing in Mexico.  It was the most  ourageous and funniest show I have ever seen.  Been trying to purchase a  tape so I can view it again and again.  He is a genious. ""Ciao""",949795200,,348,4.34375
1261347,5,B00003CWOT,Izzard shines in this off-color stand-up comedy special. Covering  everything from 'Star Wars' to virginity to Britain's role in world history  this is a must see for any fan of British humor!!!,949708800,,194,5.03125
1261348,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard, the British comedian, breaks to stereotype of un-humorus  British humor. With his outragous costumes and whip-smart tounge, Izzard  talks about his life as a ""proffessional transvestite...a male tomboy,  not drag queen, gay men have that covered and this male tomboy"" and  reviews World history with a keen eye and mouth that refelcts his  intelligence and talent as a comedian. Other then occassional swearing,  Izzard's routine is surprisingly clean and welcome in a circle of  foul-mouthed comedians like Chris Rock. Izzard is screamingly funny because  he's smart, saterizing and overall---honest.",948585600,,615,5.681318681318682

We were a bit surprised to learn that at the time, Britain was thinking about joining the EU and now have voted to Brexit. We had problems with terrorism, but not to the point it is at this time. It might have been a little dated in places, but for the most part, he was still on the mark with politics, history, his hilarious geography, being a transvestite, hiding his makeup in a squirrel hole, ""cake or death?"", do you have a flag? and all the wonderful and hilarious things he has to say.

1262339,5,B00003CWOT,"I'm sadly convinced that as we get older, something dampens our ability to find things as knicker-wettingly funny as we might have done when younger. And it seems we're less likely to be quite so intentionally funny ourselves (witness the many comedians who in their later years replaced their original good-humored hilarity with cranky, vile and vituperative acts). But Eddie Izzard's ""Dress to Kill"" seems timeless -- a light-hearted, innocent delight. True, I didn't find myself laughing out loud as much as I did at the first couple of viewings when it was originally televised, but except for a few pokes at history's well-acknowledged evil-doers, this is the kind of victim-less comedy that stands the test of time. And except for a liberal peppering of f-bombs, I think its content is otherwise acceptable viewing for teens, who might even learn a bit of history along with enjoying some laughs courtesy of a truly engaging comic.",1380758400,2,937,5.051612903225807

It you didn't get it, or couldn't be amused by it, we'd move on.  Well, we stuck with him - and now Eddie Izzard is one of his favorite comedians.

Book a couple of hours with everyone's favourite executive transvestite and treat yourself to a bundle of laughs.

I recently purchased it to share it with my teenagers who are now old enough to appreciate Izzard's absurd observational humour and to understand his cultural and historical references.

Although this stand-up routine dates from 1998, the subjects Izzard covers are as relevant now as they were then.  My 17-year old daughter and I watched it together and she was doubled-up in laughter as much as I was.

Izzard's surrealistic recounting of British history, including the famous ""Cake or Death!"" line, is without compare in the world of stand-up comedy.

I would have to compare him to George Carlin -- watching both comics, you are somewhat amazed and entertained by their speaking ability, but you don't laugh all that often.  That said, Carlin of course had (and has) tons of fans, and Izzard does as well.

I introduced his stand-up to a few friends and they all loved how different he is.  We had the pleasure of going to one of his live shows in the UK in July and he is always a pleasure to see live.

I'd seen him in Velvet Goldmine, the George Clooney Oceans movies, and known he was in The Riches and The United States of Tara. But... nothing prepared me for the hysterical, insane comic genius of his stand up act, which a friend of mine introduced me to by loaning me her DVD. He's absolutely brilliant, and what's more, it's smart stand-up. He creates comedy about history and the origins of religion, where most stand up comics are making pathetic jokes about their penises. There's no racist or sexist humor, it's just hysterical comedy, intelligently written and beautifully delivered.",1314403200,,648,4.954128440366972

He played a gangster in the movie Mystery Men with a thick gangster accent. that's what threw me, since he naturally has a slight British accent in real life. He does his shows in English, French and Italian. Not subtitled or dubbed. these are all languages he speaks fluently. He is an amazing actor and brilliant comedian. Each show is a history lesson within itself. I prefer to call him a humorist over a comedian, because he doesn't tell jokes. He tells stories that will leave you in tears.

1262626,5,B00003CWOT,"Cake or Death? I have a clear answer: Cake, cake, cake! A sheer win for Eddie Izzard. Mr. Izzard is a British, transvestite (he would argue that he's an executive transvestite), comedian with a positively lovable air about him. This is, by far, my favorite skit of his and it deserves much more than five stars. Still, that is the highest honor I can give it here and only add words as the icing.

From the moment he takes the stage you are laughing or, at the very least, smiling. He has this way about him that makes it seem like he has no idea what is going to come next and that his skit is never, truly rehearsed. In fact, if you have never watched him before perhaps you would believe that he has no clue as to where the night will take him. That is not the case, but his performance is what I am talking about and it is tip top to say the least. For nearly three hours he will give you something to laugh about!

One of his favorite themes to stick with is history. If you're a history buff you will love Eddie! He, in my opinion, would have made a great history teacher since he makes the world interesting and, above all, funny! There is not a single cruel thing to say about Eddie Izzard and this skit of his. It's poetically beautiful the way he doubles back on himself during later sections of his performance, testing memories, and seeming to enjoy it as much as his audience. Worth the time, worth the money, worth the laughs!",1296432000,,1440,4.251824817518248

I laughed so hard I a. fell off the couch and b. gave myself an asthma attack. I begged my friend to borrow the DVD, then got my own as well as every other Eddie performance I could get my hands on. Dress to Kill has some of the most sublime comedic bits I've ever seen and the encore in French is basically genius. It's weird to laugh so hard but also admire what went into it. This guy is smart as hell, that is one thing you'll take away from this. And I have heard of teachers showing his WWII stuff in their classes....anything that will entertain and educate like this does is a valuable classroom tool.

He's educated - or is it just that he's from ""the place where the history comes from"" - and although his comedy certainly contains the f- word, it is so much less offensive when he says it that I brought this in to show my Latin 4 class. One of them borrowed it to show his parents and they loved it!

Dress to Kill is funny the first time you watch it, but it gets better when you watch it again, and again, and again... It's genius.

I now own four dvd's and two that are signed by him. The way he takes history, and turns it into such hilarity, is so refreshingly delightful, his wearing makeup, and heels, because he is an 'Executive' Transvestite,  just makes it even better. I not only highly recommend Dress to Kill, but any of his performances deserve applause, although he prefers cash, he said.",1197504000,,584,4.509433962264151

He speaks in  various European languages, saying the same phrase so you know what he is talking about and yet do not understand the language. He is a great stand-up comedian. -- What is really great is while dressed is silk and high heel boots, heavy (yet sexy) make-up, -- you have to remember he is usually the heavy in most dramatic movies. He is amazing. After watching this comedian, you would love to have him over to your house as your best friend. So much fun and laughter. He is great. -- Maybe you should rent it first, to see if this is your match, but as for me I can never get enough of his humor!",1191024000,,751,4.179310344827586

I highly recommend Watching this video and Robin Williams newer material one after the other (no idea what it's called, it's the one with the water bottles.)  I didn't realize how much I had love the Izzard, until I realized how blazingly abrasive Robin Williams delivery was.  Some will of course have the opposite reaction.

My vote is for Eddie, as opposed to most other comics.  The only other two that I even try to remember by name are Mitch Hedberg and Omid Djalili.

Eddie Izzard is truly a comic genius, the best stand up working today, the smartest, funniest, most unique, insightful, lovable, adorable, talented, he's GREAT, BEYOND great.

I was walking down the street with a friend of mine after I saw it and I said - do you know Eddie Izzard?  And we immediately went into twenty minutes of ""Humperdink"" and did half the bits and then ran home to watch it again.  Everyone must own a copy of this DVD and then give it to every one of their friends.

I love you, Eddie.  You live across the street from my best friend.  I admire your talent and look forward to your next show.  Thank you.",1187395200,2,782,4.337931034482758
1262846,5,B00003CWOT,"From the way my friends raved about and quoted Izzard, I thought this DVD would be ""more"" than stand-up comedy. Now I understand why it seemed that way. Izzard takes the middlebrow humor of George Carlin, replaces his sarcasm with the kind heart and physicality of Robin Williams, and dresses it all in the self-referential story arc of a Monty Python episode (not to mention an outfit that's to die for).

Izzard expects a lot of his audience, but when they fall behind he chides them gently and brings them along; I think he'd made a great history teacher. His is certainly the only stand-up routine that left me wondering who was Prime Minister of Britain in 1962? (I was wrong: it wasn't Wilson.)",1185926400,,700,4.645161290322581

I have them all and they are all equally entertaining, but I think Dress to Kill will pull the most belly laughs out of you.  His routine is polished, stimulating, hysterical and goofy all at the same time.  LOVE the ""History"" sketch.  LOVE the shade of lipstick he wears in this one, too!  If you're a fan of Eddie, this DVD is a must-have for your collection. I keep my fingers crossed that he returns to NYC for a few live gigs in the VERY near future.",1184803200,,533,4.227722772277228
1262897,5,B00003CWOT,"I am a bit hard to please in the comedy department, usually looking for someone who is not incredibly idiotic while also looking for someone who does not make me think too hard. Eddie Izzard fits the bill perfectly in my opinion. While the make-up may throw a few people off at first, it is forgotten within five minutes of beginning his hilarious routine.

My family discovered this incredible comedian years ago, and he has not failed to keep us roaring with laughter since. To this history geek, he is especially funny in his descriptions of Hitler and chastizing Americans for not knowing their own history (because we really don't). My brother, however, prefers walking around Wal-Mart pretending he is riding a mo-ped and saying ""Ciao"" every few minutes. In short, there is something for everyone with Eddie Izzard.

I had not thought that he was so popular before due to a certain tendancy my brother and I have to confuse people in our hometown by constantly quoting this particular performance. I am glad to know that so many others appreciate this man's comedic genius as much as I do. ""Dress to Kill"" is still our favorite and looks to remain so for years to come.",1183334400,,1175,4.699029126213592

1262899,5,B00003CWOT,"The quintessential Eddie Izzard. This show is funny from start to finish. He goes into some history and if you know you're basics it's even better, but you don't have to know anything. I have watched this DVD several times now and it's still funny to me.

1262901,5,B00003CWOT,"Although he currently stars with minnie driver on the The Riches, he's best known for his comedy stand-up. This is my personal favorite of all Eddie Izzards dvd's. It is filled with wit, one liners, and a continued plot of genuine world history, according to eddie. i put a flag in it, it's mine!!! He's entertaining and hilarious, and I don't imagine anyone could watch this, whether for the first or tenth time, without laughing out loud. yes, he is a man in drag. yes, he addresses this, he is an executive transvestite, not a weirdo transvestite. a male lesbian if you will. a laugh a minute? only if you're not paying attention...",1180396800,,635,4.628318584070796
1262902,5,B00003CWOT,"Izzard is unrelentingly funny in this late 90's concert from San Francisco. There are laugh out loud moments nearly all the time and even having watched it more than a dozen times now it I still find it funny. Even when the material isn't that funny (which it can't be 100% of the time for everyone) I always find Eddie Izzard interesting to listen to. Underlying his comedy is an intelligent and thoughtful man.

There are some good extra's, particularly if you speak French (as Izzard does)! Many of his shows are worth buying but this DVD catches him at a comedy peak. Sadly since then the shows have not been of the same quality but this one and the ones that precede it are all worth getting.",1180137600,,697,4.4453125
1262903,4,B00003CWOT,"What a fantastic comedy DVD. Izzard is a man of pugnaciously funny satirical intelligence. This routine covers history, philosophy, gender relations, political extremism and the travails of learning French. Eddie blends all these elements into a two hour tour de force of whirlwind comedy. Based in San Francisco, he begins with a description of the Bay Area - 'these cable cars, all levers, the drivers have no idea what to do' and embarks on a frenzied, stream of consciousness stand up routine. Here you will learn why we tolerate dictators who kill their own people but not others countries', why schoolboy French is no use in the real world, why Americans have difficulties with history, and will question whether Englebert Humberdink is dead or not.

Occasionally Izzard's humour misses a beat, but most people with a brain, an ear for satire and an appreciation of fine, lateral humour, will get great pleasure from this DVD.",1180137600,,932,5.012903225806451

Catching up with Izzard on his new show The Riches made me remember how much I enjoyed this performance. I am very happy I decided to buy it--he touches on an amazing variety of subjects, from the Pilgrims to puberty. He is always very funny, and some of his observations really make you think, not just laugh. My two older teen-agers also enjoyed it, and ""Cake or Death? (one of the best routines) has become our new catch-phrase.",1178409600,,544,4.45

1262986,5,B00003CWOT,"I've always been a fan of ""executive transvestite/action transvestite"" Eddie Izzard (or well, for a long time anyway) and his ""Dress to Kill"" show only gives me so much more to like him for.

He is at his rambling, mumbling, crossdressing best in this show, where he put his own intellectual spin on comedy. And does it very well. He amongst other things describes why the church of England couldn't have been the force behind the Spanish Inquisition, ""death or cake!"". He also touches on stonehenge, Hitler, Hollywood v. Britain, world history, the European Dream, much more. He is, in a word, hillarious. His slightly intellectual take on comedy (more in the choosing of subjects than in the treatment of them really), is one of the major factors in his being such a great comedian. He cleverly avoids the ""trap"" of talking about the differences about men and women or sex (which is all funny enough once in a while when you've had 8 pints and such, but it's getting a bit stale), and instead looks at the absurdities and wickedness of life and history in general. Also his way of delivering the jokes in a seemingly random and brain storming sort of way, supported by his mumbling facts he dosen't know, changing (to totally unrelated) subjects with no link, and his speaking French now and then, help make the show even funnier. I've seen it 4 times and it had me in stitches every single time. I think John Cleese was spot on, when he said that Eddie Izzard is ""the lost Python"".

Well, anyway, you'd have to see it for yourself. I can do nothing but give this show 5 stars and my full support. It IS hillarious.",1176595200,,1617,4.572413793103448

Mensa and all.

I like people who can think analytically without sounding like they're [...], speaking freely about current events, as well as past events with all of the wit and humor needed to make history interesting...  In fact, he knows more about American History than I think most college graduates here in the US...

He shifts smoothely from history lesson to cultural parody to sheer nuttiness without losing an iota of momentum. He exhibits a tangential tendancy to impression and pantomime reminiscent of Williams, but with more panache than sheer mania; he likewise veers occasionally toward Carlinesque scathing critiques, but again steers toward his own approach, such that it remains his own performance rather than degenerating into some kind of ""carlin-light."" He can draw comedy out of bizarre factoids of history, out of sheer tragedy, and out of the most asinine and mundane moments. He can tease the audience as he casually rattles off fact, but also draws them into collaboration with his most impish takes on what should be horrible ideas.

This is the recording of a live show that played in san Francisco and therefore Eddie, that is English, is playing to an American audience. I have seen him play both to English and American audiences and, having lived in both countries, I am always amazed at how he can adapt his very unique british humor so brilliantly to US culture. Cross cultural humor must be his forte though, as in the special features of this DVD, we get to se him play in french to the french! Now that is brave...

Every time I watch a show of Eddie's I always come away thinking that he is one hell of a smart guy. His witt is rasor sharp and his stream of consciousness humor is one of the zaniest you will ever witness.

This is very intellectual comedy though certainly loaded with expletives that unfortunately seem to be necessary -- or perhaps even the sole reason -- for something to be funny. FO being the most frequent. Insights galore and very near worth watching several times.

This DVD is no exception. It's probably some of the finest comedy I've encountered in years, and I've managed to turn three more people onto the charms of Eddie.

1263230,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard is one of the most interesting comics I have seen in a long time. He is from England and has that sharp wit and satirical sharpness that would make anyone one who is even somewhat sensible (or intelligent) laugh out loud. He has also done some acting and been featured in movies like The Avengers, Mystery Men and Oceans Twelve as well as others.

His insights into history, religion, American Culture and even our own presidents are amazingly accurate - if not someone satirical with a resounding ring of ""truth"". What makes you laugh is not the fact that he is the self proclaim ""Executive Transvestite"" (he likes women) - but the way in which he tells the ironies of history. Questions that, now in hindsight, we can ask not and actually say, ""what were they thinking"".

His color visions and interpretations and even impressions are astonishingly humorous and right on target. He does where a dress and high heals and make-up too, but he addresses all of that as well. He even plays with the audience and tells a few stories that are true - well maybe not - well yes they are - well then again......it's hysterical watching him do that!

This particular concert was done in San Francisco and back in 1999. It has to be the funniest of the bunch - although his other concerts are as sharp as this one! He has a great time even with the San Francisco natives as well. You can tell he knows what he is talking about because of the audience's reactions and hysterical laughter.

This DVD extras have something unique. The commentary is in two different languages. English and French. Also there is a whole separate concert on this DVD that he did in France and yes it is all in French. Directed by Lawrence Jorden, a renowned director of music videos, concerts and TV Specials including - Barry Manilow, Duran Duran, John Mellencamp, Dave Mathews, David Bowie and many more - this concert works on Many levels. This DVD is fun, funny and intelligent. If you like intelligent humor - this concert is for you! You'll watch it over and over and stil laugh every time!

1263232,3,B00003CWOT,"Before last night, I must confess that I was an Eddie Izzard virgin.  While I may have witnessed him in several film roles, it wasn't until this moment did I honestly know who this man was, how he thought, or that is true calling was in front of a large American audience making us chuckle at ourselves.  Izzard is a transvestite, and is not ashamed to announce this to his audiences.  Our first image of Izzard is in full make-up dressed as a female, little did I know that this was actually his ""signature"" appearance.  Again, this is something that you do not know about the man while simply watching his films.  If you want to experience Izzard for the first time, I think any of his one-man routines would be of help.  Like a bottle of fresh wine, my wife and I chose Dress to Kill as our first sip of Izzard.  I suppose it is as good as anywhere to begin.  So, one fateful Saturday night, we popped his DVD into our player, sat ourselves down, and began the nearly two hour adventure into the mind of Eddie Izzard.  Needless to say, I was both impressed and unimpressed all at once.

Izzard's routine, like a small child dealing with ADD, was all over the place.  We open Dress to Kill with an homage of sorts to the San Francisco trolley line coupled with Alcatraz.  It is a random opening, which should have given us an indication of what Izzard's performance was about to transform into.  With inconsistent voice-overs about the people riding the trolley to nearly annoying repetitive wording, we are swept into the auditorium finally to see Izzard in person.  Dressed rather feminine, he dashes on stage and begins his bits about politics, Britain, and history.  Izzard, is literally, all over the place with his comedy.  Spewing bits of humor mixed with, what I would later learn as classic, mumbles, pauses, and what felt like a complete lack of focus.  Don't get me wrong, there were some bits that just would make you laugh with delight.  Some that I remember were the ""cake or death"", Hollywood British villains, the American way, and his classic ""yes/no"" routine.  Sadly, these humorous elements nearly clashed with his random tangents, which went quickly into a fast rewind back to his memorized routine.

It is obvious that Eddie Izzard is a smart man.  From his routine, in which historical dates and events are obviously a excitable subject for him, you can see where his strengths and weaknesses are.  His weakness, in my eyes, is the audience.  It becomes abundantly clear midway through his bits that he will fall way off the subject if it is something the audience attaches itself to.  In one aspect he would be discussing how the British loved to land on islands and place a flag there to call their own, the audience would laugh, he would go off on a tangent, and suddenly, ten minutes later, he would go back to that original thought.  After a few times of doing this, I was annoyed.  It is my belief that Izzard is a funny person by nature.  He has the ability to make audiences laugh because of his eclectic style and excitement, sadly, what fails in this performance is his lack of formal comedy training.  Now, I am no expert in the matter, but watching other famous comedians perform their routines, there seems to be a level of professionalism surrounding them.  Watch Ray Romano, Rodney Dangerfield, or Jerry Seinfeld do their shows and you will witness a clean, crisp show which demonstrates to me that these performers actually rehearsed, rehearsed, and rehearsed again to get it right.  Izzard, it was obvious, did not.  Maybe he did, but in Dress to Kill it just felt like he read the newspaper one day, thought of some funny jokes, memorized a pattern, and nearly forgot it while on stage.  He seemed sporadic and completely unprepared.  I need to watch more Izzard, maybe this is his style, but for me, it seemed cheap and distorted.

Coupled with Izzard's procrastination approach to comedy, the production value on this DVD felt like a late 80s release.  I felt like I was watching an RPG game in which the camera angle goes everywhere except for the places that you instantly need it.  Either the cameraman was drunk or the director just loved jumping from angle to angle.  As viewers, we would find ourselves with a full shot of Izzard, then jump to a distance shot, to some random audience angle, and followed by some other random angle.  We couldn't just stay in one place, but just like Izzard's routine, seemed to be all over the place with no consistency.  Like most comedy DVDs, I wanted to see the audience laughing, I wanted to see more of Izzard's expressions (which, in my humble opinion, are his best traits), I wanted to see more of Izzard in general.  The quality of this DVD does not enhance the quality of Izzard's show, sadly, it only seems to bring the overall production value down.

Overall, if I were asked to watch another Eddie Izzard one-man stand-up routine, I would proudly say ""yes"".  Perhaps this was one of his less valued tours (which is strange because it is this one that won him the most awards), but I want to give Izzard another chance.  Eddie Izzard is hysterical when he works on his routine.  His random interjections can be funny, but it is his well-developed jokes and commentary that really make his style of comedy stand out.  I am eager to watch his ""action"" transvestite on screen and watch this ""full-of-potential"" comic develop in his career.  Would I suggest this DVD to friends?  I think that I would for the tasty cookies crumbled between ill-placed jokes, but I do not think I could watch Dress to Kill another time.

1263233,5,B00003CWOT,"with this rapid-fire show.

Not only does Izzard deliver the most outrageous, sacrilegious material (and no, not in the Carlin style you're imagining), but he delivers it with the speed of a gatlin gun.

His delivery is impeccable.  He covers everything from squirrels to a transvetite brigade in the military, to a father/son argument between God and Jesus (jeezy chreezy).  Scooby Doo is thrown in for good measure as well as the dubious demise of Englebert Humperdink.

I had to turn OFF this DVD for a good five minutes to recover and then like a masochist, turned it back on to endure more pain in my stomach and tears streaming down my face from this genius.

Now granted, I have a certain penchant for British humor to begin with, and heaven knows I have my own warped sense of humor.....were it not for the fact that I were afraid that this guy would borrow my lipstick, I'd marry him.  (sorry hubby)

1263235,5,B00003CWOT,"I was lucky enough to catch this special on HBO and laughed so hard, I cried & my sides hurt! A good kind of hurt, of course. Eddie Izzard being a transvestite really has nothing to do with his comedy because he is smart, international and hilarious and his being transvestite is really quite secondary to his intelligent style of comedy. He does have that kind of ""British"" humor that's dry and some people may not get it.

Pascal Meunier (see his other reviews for a sample of his tastes) on a previous review on this page said this wasn't funny & that Izzard ""babbles & pisses on everything."" Talk about inaccurate!!! Negative reviews only get ""not helpful"" when there is a lopsided or un-defended attack on a person or product. If well written with a substantiated argument, a negative review can be quite helpful. His complaint was that he got this DVD on the strength of misleading reviews. I will give a full & complete review for any other prospective buyers

Firstly, Izzard doesn't ""piss"" on everything- he is an observer of everything. One of the truest & best observations he makes is the one that people like Pol Pot and Stalin killed people in their own country & basically got away with it because, as he said, ""we're kinda fine with that, we've been trying to kill you for years!"" but of course, Hitler, silly man, killed people next door and we won't stand for that after a while. Like most comedy (for example Chris Rock saying when you date people they don't meet you, they meet your representative,) Izzard's comedy is funny because it is observations of things we all know are TRUE. I couldn't help notice that Robin Williams, who has a similar style of fast, smart comedy, was one of the producers of this show. I would guess HE thinks he's funny. As for a comparison to George Carlin, one of my personal favorites, that's really quite useless because everyone's comedy is different. I'm a big Robert Schimmel fan & his comedy is generally crude, sexual and outrageous- outrageously funny, but different. That is why there are so many different types of comedians, something for everyone. I guess Eddie is an intellectuals' comedian- and what's wrong with that? Isn't it about time?

He has funny jokes about Henry VIII who basically shagged women & killed them, about the Anglican Church being too lenient and offering ""cake or death"" in their theoretical inquisition. The international clout of Scooby-Doo and the ""Falstaff"" comparison is great. I never go to an action flick at the theatre eating popcorn with out thinking of his ""Room with a View of Hell, staircase of Satan!"" Or his hilarious take on the Heimlich Maneuver or Englebert Humperdink/Jerry Dorsey and his name. There is just so much in this that is funny, and now that I've been watching it while writing my review - he isn't pissing on everything- to the contrary, he's amazingly positive actually- especially compared to most comedians (for example Carlin)!

This is a great comedian and a wonderful stand-up concert that you will watch over & over- luckily, as another reviewer said, it gets funnier each time you watch it. 6 stars out of 5!!!!!",1136073600,2,3138,4.741758241758242

I, being and insomniac, was up late channel surfing when I came accross Dressed To Kill.  I watched it and laughed so hard that I was afraid I was going to wake my sleeping parents.

For years I told everyone I could about Eddie Izzard but wished I had a way for them to see it.

When it came to DVD I bought it instantly and have since introduced many of my friends and family members to Eddie Izzards hilarious brand of comedy.

I have probably seen it 100 times and I laugh almost as hard every time as I did the first time I saw it.

Sure he uses profanity, but sparingly, and only when it seems  appropriate in order to complement the joke(s). Too many American comics seem to rely on the shock value of profanity at

the expense of cleverness, wit, etc.

Izzard, like (I suspect) other foreign comedians, is better when

the subject is topical and the audience can readily identify

with it.  This is the case in this superb performance in San

My husband and I have turned many of our friends into die-hard-fans and I think every one of them bought this DVD. So buy it!!

Now if you get weirded out by guys that dress as girls, you need to get over it and learn how to deal with it so you can enjoy this flick, because it is too funny to not watch.",1115683200,2,648,3.764705882352941
1263380,5,B00003CWOT,"Before I came across Eddie I admit my knowledge of stand up comedy wasn't at its highest but I didn't find the stuff I'd seen on TV very funny. This was the first of Eddie's shows I saw and I've been hooked ever since. It's not just his funny, sometimes random, humour but his hilarious mannerisms and expressions.  Best bits are by far ""cake or death!"" and the squirel ""did I leave the gas on?!"" pure genius!! Also recommend Unrepeatable with the amazingly funny 'Cat drilling' sketch. And also his new Sexy Dvd which I had the priveledge to see at Wembley. By far the funniest guy on the planet!! But beware you will, once you get hooked, be quoting him every second of the day!!",1113696000,2,681,4.404761904761905
1263381,5,B00003CWOT,"I first saw Eddie Izzard in the Cat's Meow, playing Charlie Chaplin and found him incredibly sexy and charming.  The next time I heard of Eddie Izzard, he was on a national morning talk show and I was surprised to find out he was a transvestite.  The hosts were extolling his performance in this show and Eddie was just as hilarious on the talk show as he is in this routine.  But I never saw Dressed to Kill until I was going through the cable channels and saw it listed.  My husband and I laughed so hard we were crying.  I LOVE this man's ability to spin history into an unbelievably funny comedy routine.  I mean, I love history, but not many do, and can you believe that it would be interesting or even hilarious?  Eddie Izzard's free-association  delivery makes Robin Williams look almost geriatric (hmmm...maybe not, I don't think he'll ever slow down!)

I suppose the only gripe I have about this show is Eddie's choice of dress...come on Eddie, you looked like some middle-aged housewife from the suburbs!!  Let's have more flash: drop those clunky wedge sandals and ""just screaming 60's polyester"" blouse and put on some sexy spiky heels, a leather skirt and a tight sweater!  Ohh, maybe that's too Ed Wood.  Ya know, I find it somewhat disconcerting that I'm this attracted to a man who dresses like a woman...

If you like intelligent humor the dry wit of this British genius is for you.

1263382,1,B00003CWOT,"I was told how brilliant this humorous DVD was... ""like Monty Python."" Uh, no, not at all. I love Python and I do get most of British humor. Too many jokes were just flat and not really clever (half the time he says ""and that one didn't go over well"") and I didn't really think that very many bits were all that clever. This isn't close to being in the same league as Python. Perhaps this guy is funnier but the material was very bland and he seemed bored. This is not even close to Pythonesque and to compare is an insult. Perhaps the great ratings are a result of a cult following of teenagers. If you are really interested, you'll be glad you rented it first.",1111449600,9,662,4.2204724409448815
1263383,5,B00003CWOT,"I saw this show as a special on HBO years ago. I didn't think that a man dressed as a woman could be this funny, but since he is an ""executive transvestite"", you just have to like him from the beginning. What I find so amazing about Eddie Izzard is that he is able to blend history with comedy. His suttle little remarks have you pausing the dvd to hear it again to make sure you understood it and got the humor in it. I enjoy his jokes at the Brits, the Americans and the French. Making fun of how differently things are pronounced here and in the UK.

We own all of Eddies dvds, videos and cd's. I have my 16 year old listening to his cds when he goes to bed.

Keep it up, Eddie....We love you!!!",1110931200,,698,4.014388489208633
1263384,5,B00003CWOT,"There are a lot of intriguing things in this world, and a transvestite comedian is one of them.  Now, that is probably what distinguishes Eddie Izzard most from the run-of-the-mill comedians, or even those better known, however his hilarity sets him off as well.

Eddie keeps the humor going, all the while mixing stories and what not.  Not only that, but he is smart too, and not just in wit.  Some of the jokes, the very few, that do go over the audience are just because of how either complex they are, or how interrelated they are to his other ones.

Do not think he just keeps making transvestite jokes either, because he is very well rounded.  Simply put, he will have anyone laughing in no time, and that is more then his job; it is his life.

1263386,5,B00003CWOT,"So, if you like blokes wearing a bit of make-up, hopping about in heels, and giving you a brief lesson in British and American histories, you'll love this offering from Izzard.

I've been a fan of his for several years, and own the DVD with all the goodies. The Featurette documentary on the tour, the technical difficulties, the banter with the audiences, are all well worth watching. Especially because they are partly narrated by an intoxicated Izzard, filmed after the wrap party.

Very much in the vein of Monty Python, his comedy is a great mix of facial expression, esoteric obscure references, and lampooning Those In Charge.",1103500800,2,633,4.906542056074766
1263387,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard should be a history teacher. He helped me remember facts for my AP European History Exam, which I passed, so yes parents, this is very educational. Perhaps he is my mentor and comedic hero. This DVD is quite awesome. His little intros are always soooo cool. My favorite intro is in ""Glorious."" I have ""Circle"", ""Glorious"", and this one, ""Dress to Kill"" and this one just beats them by a second. Its intelligent, hilarious, and will make you Grandma cry and your biggoted neighbor go ""arg them transvestites, always living off the state."" Buy this and all his other DVDs.

1263432,5,B00003CWOT,"At the risk of offending, a ""callback"" is a reference to a joke told earlier in the show and nobody does it better than Eddie Izzard.  (Though she is very different, Rita Rudner's Born to be Mild is a showcase for them.  Her act is now a pale imitation of her early, wonderful stuff.)  Callbacks are tell-tales of a well crafted performance.  Dress to Kill may appear spontaneous but it is actually very scripted and Izzard's ability to make it look like stream-of-conscience raises the level from clever to hysterical.

When this show first appeared on HBO we taped it and made every guest watch it for the next 2 months.  A 19 year-old college student liked it as much as my 80-something parents.  What's more, we liked it over and over again.

1263433,5,B00003CWOT,"I first saw this ""by accident"" when it was on HBO back in '98(?) and fell off the couch laughing (literally) at the ""cake or death"" bit.  After recovering from the fall and watching the rest of the show, I tried to find it's next showing (so I could tape it) only to find out that I had just seen it's last scheduled showing.  I eventually forgot about the show until last year when this DVD appeared, much to my surprise, in our local book/music store.  You can imagine that, living in Carlsbad, New Mexico (motto--""We wish we were in Texas""), I would never have expected to see a DVD with a transvestite on the cover, much less a British one.  I immediately purchased it, brought it home and proceeded to make my wife and son watch it.  We fell in love and must have watched it everyday for a month.  Lines from the show started creeping into our conversations (""Do you have a flag?"", ""I'm arranging matches."") and we have not been the same since.  We have since made everyone we know watch this DVD and, without exception, have turned them all into Eddie Izzard fans.  This is comedy that will keep you in stitches and make you think all at the same time.  BUY IT NOW!!!",1099872000,8,1173,4.344036697247707
1263434,5,B00003CWOT,"This is an excellent comedy DVD. Eddie is hilarious, in a very smart way. He comments on a variety of facts of pop-culture, keeping his audience laughing all the way.

1263437,5,B00003CWOT,"This is how Eddie Izzard describes himself this hilarious show. He also calls himself a ""male tomboy."" Wearing makeup that normal, executive women would wear on an everyday basis, he takes on topics such as history(my favorite), the space race, president Kennedy, and losing his virginity before he lost his virginity!

His brilliance comes from the fact that what he does is simply talk to his audience and, in effect, has a one sideded conversation with them. He's an expert at reacting to what the audience laughs at and what they don't laugh at prolonging the Engelbert Humperdink dead/alive joke for at least two minutes. His commentary on the toddler nature of which some of our leaders have handled history is the best part of the show.

""Hitler killed people next door. Ah, stupid man! After a couple of years we won't stand for that!""

""So the American government lied to the indians for many, many years and then Clinton lied about having an affair, and everybody was surprised. A little naive I feel!""

He carries on conversations with himself that are almost schizophrenic in nature.

1263478,5,B00003CWOT,"I stumbled upon this show late one night while flipping channels. Mr. Izzard's sort of three-quarters drag getup caught my attention, along with the fact that he was performing in French! The program was almost over (don't worry--only the encore was performed, and only partially, in French), so I immediately set my TiVo to record the next showing. After seeing the whole thing, I loved it so much I bought the DVD.

Mr. Izzard's comedy is for people who know a lot about history, politics, art, language and human nature. The best lines have all been quoted here already (at least the ones in English--his French rendition of a few of the show's best bits is hysterical, even if you only speak very basic high school French). But zingers aren't the point of this show. It's a wise, humanist look at western history and culture from a wonderfully odd, if informed, perspective. It's worth owning because, unlike most standup, it bears repeated viewing, revealing new gems each time.",1094083200,4,983,4.851190476190476
1263479,5,B00003CWOT,"A close friend of mine introduced me to Eddie Izzard several years ago via a cassette tape of his stand-up.  Upon examining the case, I almost dismissed him thinking a man in full make-up and feminine clothing couldn't possibly produce a brand of humor which would amuse me.  Oh I was so wrong!  I laughed out loud for over an hour and then listened to the tape again and again on that 13-hour trip.  Time flies too fast and unfortunately, Izzard's existence was striken from my mind in a blur of final exams and new jobs.  Until about a year ago, when a late night TV bonanza had my boyfriend and I near coma, we stumbled upon an HBO presentation of Dress to Kill.  Easily one of the top five comedians of this era, Izzard will have you laughing hysterically, out loud--even if you are alone.  He manages to comment on a variety of topics from religion to star wars to make-up.  He is witty and thankfully well-versed in both current affairs as well as history.  Buy this DVD, you will not regret it!",1093737600,,1001,4.396739130434782
1263480,5,B00003CWOT,"This is a great DVD. I love Dress to Kill. Eddie Izzard is by far one of the funniest comedians on Earth. Although the DVD has no special features or anything really cool, the show is a must-see for comedy lovers. it is quite a long show lasting well over 2 hours, but every minute of it is hilarious. unlike most comedians who mainly talk about differences between men and women and relationship troubles, eddie talks mainly about history, religion, geography, and music. a change in pace indeed. all he talks about is accurate and true. you can get a great history lesson in this DVD. there is some language not intened for the whole family, not that many comics are these days. i highly recommend this DVD for people looking for a good laugh. you will laugh eventually.",1092096000,,772,4.561151079136691
1263481,4,B00003CWOT,"Eddie is so quintessentially English he'll make you want to bake scones. But somehow, he seems to have broken the trans-Atlantic barriers and become ridiculously popular with Americans.  Strange because he does tend to take the piss out of them, right there, in their faces and they just keep laughing.  Fantastic!

Eddie is an acquired taste.  Forget the transvestite shtick, he's been doing it for so long it's just a diversion from his genius.  Eddie isn't the joke, punchline comic.  He's stream of conscious, surreal and observational, and if you can keep up, you're doing well.  Eddie seems to live in Eddie-world, where dogs talk and 'they're not happy with their wash'.  See what I mean?

Dress To Kill is probably my favourite of the Izzard shows.  It's definitely got the strongest laugh factor.  Other shows have better belly laughs, but they're more sporadic.  On DTK, he never lets up; from 'San Francisco is full of snakes' to the brilliant 'British films are like, I say, you, me, I, er..' and American heros via The Great Escape and Star Wars. Oh dear, I'm crying with laughter just thinking about it!

Like I said before, Izzard is not for everyone.  Yes, he wears dresses and makeup, even though he's built like a truck driver and he does tend to do the same tranny humour routine early on in every show which can tiresome, but he's pretty much as close to comedic genius as you can get.  The DVD captures his delivery perfectly - he does tend to trip up on his thoughts and forget what he was talking about.  But it's part of the charm, of course.

You may want to start with Unrepeatable (DVD), which will get you started on the Izzard vibe.  He has a habit of developing a couple of his jokes through his shows, so sometimes there is inside reference for his true fans that you may just miss.  Don't worry though, Dressed to Kill can be viewed by anyone and you really won't miss a beat. If you're disappointed by this DVD, then I will eat my hat.  No, really.

San Francisco was surely a changed place after he went through it... 'pris priso prison prisoners to Alcatraz' indeed!",1092096000,3,2101,4.579088471849866
1263482,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie is a master at his craft.  I was very reluctant to watch this show featuring a transvestite.  I thought the humor would be lost on Americans (including me) and that his stage persona could only alienate me.  I am SO glad I decided to give Dress To Kill a chance.  He stands as my favorite comic today.  After about 10 minutes, you almost forget he's a transvestite, he's so good.  Do yourself a favor.  If you consider yourself open-minded and ready for a good laugh, get this DVD.",1091145600,2,487,4.404494382022472

Eddie is not for the family, but can be cleaner than say Robin Williams or Dennis Miller (both of whom are funny).  This is interesting coming from an Ermican, but Izzard gives most comics here a run for their money.  Eddie does great on WWII, the dryness of the Anglican Church, James Mason as God, British actors playing Star Wars villains and Nazis (wrangle up some bloody Germans), Empires, Italy, NRA, and other topics that most don't use for punchlines.  Eddie Izzard is hilarious.  When I bought this I figured it was worth a watch and could be auctioned if I did not like it.  However, this and Circle- Eddie's 2nd or maybe 1st DVD are worthy additions to Williams and Miller.  Eddie, I salute you sir.  FYI- the sound and video are decent, for a made for cable special.

I actually special ordered it from England because it wasn't yet available in the US -- this should tell you how fantastic Eddie Izzard is.  Very few comedians have the ability to make me laugh out loud so continuously.  He flows seamlessly from seemingly unrelated topics like his childhood desire to climb trees and join the army to squirrels wearing lipstick, and does it all in a way that you hardly notice the utter absurdity of it all.  In this show in particular, he delves into religion and world history from angles never seen before.  And all the while you hardly notice that he's wearing platforms and eyeshadow.

Despite his use of the ""F word"" from time to time, I allowed my 10 year old sons (now 15 and HUGE fans) to watch his bit - not because I am fond of cursing, but because Eddie uses it to ENHANCE rather than support his incredibly brilliant form of humor.  He is like a comedic history lesson in this show, enlightening we Americans of the true meaning of history, and sharing factual lessons in such a humorous manner, that our children are actually left educated - not just delighted.

That was over a year ago and we still watch it and laugh as though it were our first time seeing it.  I am just in love with this witty, brilliant, funny and dare I say handsome intertainer.  I love comedy but Eddie is the ONLY comedian whose comedy I've ever bought - which says a lot.  He is refreshing, funny and just plain out of this world.  His explanation of the difference between American and English movies is not to be missed (I love the staircase of Satan, Pond of death). Anyone who has not seen Dress to Kill is missing out on some of the most entertaining comedy of their life.  If you love to laugh, you have to get this.",1072310400,7,976,4.094736842105263

1263572,5,B00003CWOT,"A few years back, I caught the second half of Eddie's routine on HBO, and was instantly in love with this British transvestite comedic genius. I was on a mission to get a copy of it for my own collection to have his seamless wit and stream-of-consciousness humor available at my whim, and I can almost garauntee just such an addiction to anyone who decides to take the leap and see what all the fuss is about. It's an undertaking I wholeheartedly recommend.
I've seen a good amount of stand up in my time, but Mr. Izzard puts a unique spin on the whole genre. His flawless humor is laced with what can only be described as incredible intelligence as he makes hilarious comments about Europe's ex-empires and past tyrannical leaders. In his set, James Mason plays both God and President Kennedy, Sean Connery is featured as King Henry, even Shaggy and Scooby Doo have a delightful cameo appearance. Not to mention when Prime Minister Englebert Slapteyback decided to put a man on the face of the earth in the space race...
Izzard has a lot to say, and it's all worth hearing. His humor is funny but not foamy and meaningless as some comics seem to be able to come up with. And one can only wonder what he's ad-libbing, because it all seems so spur-of-the-moment sidesplitting. Did this guy really sit down and actually write out all of this strangely sensible absurdity?
All in all, I'm in love. Eddie, will you marry me?",1070496000,2,1420,4.572549019607843
1263573,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard's brand of humor is absolutely unparalleled. Most of his act is verbal, with little physical comedy beyond comical facial expressions. Izzard's comedy is smart and sharply witty without being overbearingly cerebral, obtuse, smug, or ascerbic (like Dennis Miller). He pokes fun at himself and others in a socially conscious way, but never in a bitter, mean, or petty way (like George Carlin). His characterizations (such as Dr. Heimlich, inventor of the famous maneuver) are fresh, original, and outrageously hilarious. Izzard shows all the offbeat zaniness of Robin Williams, without the mania. In other words, Izzard is a composite of the best features of the best of the witty comics working today, minus their flaws.
In this performance, Izzard's musings are (as usual) totally offbeat yet devilishly clever: How did Heimlich perfect his maneuver? What posessed singer Jerry Dorsey to change his name to Engelbert Humperdinck? What would an Anglican inquisition be like?
To top it all off, you definitely get your money's worth: the show runs for about two hours! Intelligent, satirical humor just doesn't get better than this.",1069804800,3,1143,5.320441988950276
1263574,5,B00003CWOT,"To come straight to the point, Eddie Izzard is one the funniest comedians around. He uses many references to history to make the greatest jokes. Many people get turned off by his attire, but personally, I think that it only helps him obtain the atmosphere that he is trying to win. Watching this DVD is two hours of non-stop laughing and you will find yourself repeating his jokes time and time again.

1263575,5,B00003CWOT,"No doubt about it - this is the most brilliant comedy show captured on film in the last decade.  Izzard rambles through every conceivable topic in his zany way, from the history of the British empire to the weather in San Francisco (where the show was taped).  He touches on Paganism, alternative sexualities in the military, squirrels with makeup, slogans of the NRA, Engelbert Humperdink, the EU, the Pope on a scooter, and cannibalism.  Bizzarre, and yet the routines flow so seemlessly into one another you almost can't believe it.  While watching this, I would estimate that I fell out of my chair laughing so hard that I was crying at least once every 5 minutes.  This trumps Chris Rock, George Carlin, Robin Wiliams, you name it.  Not only is Izzard funny, but he has a very keen eye for social and political commentary as well.  Simply put, this is the smartest, funniest DVD you could possible own and you should not consider yourself a true comedy fan unless you have seen it.",1069027200,3,986,4.664739884393064

1263577,5,B00003CWOT,"I got hooked on Eddie Izzard (pronounced iz-ZARD) on college and Dress to Kill was my first DVD purchase.  The whole DVD is hilarious, from the opening mock-umentary of San Francisco to his opening monologue to the encore performance.  He makes jokes about everything, from religion to sex to the military to career advice -- and all very intelligently.  He was obviously influenced heavily by Monty Python, so his stand-up is like a one-man Flying Circus show.
The DVD commentary is also amusing and worth listening to -- who wouldn't want more Eddie?  There is also a raw cut of a performance in Paris, done in between the D2K tour and the Circle tour, thus having some of the material from each show.  That show is done in French, but you can view English subtitles, and also listen to his commentary for that show.  In a sense, you're getting four helpings of Eddie in one DVD: S.F. show + commentary and Paris show + commentary.
Eddie Izzard is one of the smartest, funniest comedians on the stage today.  Buy this DVD, share it with your friends, and spread the Word of Eddie to the world -- we'll all be the better for it!",1067904000,2,1129,4.532019704433497

While his various routines are classics - cake or death, the clever use of flags, Gunther Heimlich, squirrels with flutes, and the president of Burundi, the thing I remember best about this video is his pseudo-post-virginity breakfast song:
""Hey, just sit there.  Breakfast cereal, bacon and eggs. Bit of coffee bubbling away. Freshly squeezed mango juice!""
I can't hear the word ""mango"" now without thinking of this. Why he didn't lose his virginity for real *immediately* after the words ""mango juice"" escaped his lips that morning (he had to wait another year!) is one of the mysteries of the universe.",1061769600,2,870,4.918367346938775

I have to say that this was perhaps one of the funniest evenings I have ever been party to.  When I heard that they were releasing this show on DVD I was excited ... and I must say that it did not loose anything in the translation from Live to Audio to Video.
Eddie Izzard's shows seem to resemble stream-of-consiousness ... he will jump from one topic into an entirely different topic at nary a moments notice.  But this is ok.  It reminds me of a one-man Monty Python ... just as crazy ... just as funny.
I would recommend Eddie Izzard to anyone who likes the works of Monty Python or Mr. Show.  If you don't get British comedy (what a shame) then you will probably not get Eddie Izzard either (more of a shame).",1058745600,,808,4.2272727272727275

His ability weave humor, history and a French lesson into one amazing show made me into an Eddie Izzard groupie. While living in Chicago, a friend and I were desperate to see him live. We decided to go to the theatre in hopes of getting two extra tickets to the sold out show. Low and behold we bought our 3rd row seat tickets from a transvestite and his girlfriend!!!

I have watched my tape of this performance so many times I know it word for word. I have also forced all of my friends to watch it and they too have fallen under his magnetic spell. I often run into resistance from my straight male friends when they realize this is a transvestite comedian, but within the first 5 minutes they too are hooked and seemingly forget the commentary on life, history and painful yet hilarious insights into coming-of-age are coming from a man in a dress and FABULOUS make up! I especially like the fact that this British comic is filmed doing his stand up in America (albeit in San Francisco where the audience may be a bit more ""receiving* of his unique brand of humor). His insights are priceless and his constant moving about the stage and fantastic facial expressions make this a performance you will not be able to take your eyes off of. See this. And quick. My friends and I have adopted several lines from the performance as our own little private jokes, such as, ""It wasn't me, I was dead at the time!"" and ""Oh Sue! I've got legs. Do you like bread? I've got a french loaf. I love you! Byeeeee!!!!"" and ""I was on the moon at the time. With Steve.""
 This one performance led me to seek out several of his film roles including ""The Cat's Meow"" (excellant as Charlie Chaplin), ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (uh, WOW), and the [bad] ""Mystery Men"" (skip it).

He is one of the funniest comedians who you will never hear of outside of England.  He's been in several marginally-successful movies, but only as a bit player.  He is probably best seen in the HBO special for Dressed To Kill.  I will go out on a limb and guess that that's where most of us first saw him.

I was flipping channels once and came across an English transvestite (excuse me, ""executive transvestite"") doing a comedy routine in Alcatraz prison.  I stopped flipping channels, and, for the next two hours, almost died laughing.  Izzard's humor is unique and it works on many levels.  A lot of comedians target a particular demographic.  Their humor can be too trite or too low-brow or too high-brow for some.  Not Eddie.  On the one hand, he's clearly intelligent and educated and his comedy contains much that will tickle even the most intellectual of viewers.  But he combines this with good old-fashioned silliness and dead-on impressions that he will have the most slack-jawed luddite in stitches.
Even as I type this, I'm laughing to myself thinking about several of his routines (""Cake or death?"") and will probably go home and watch it again.  And that's the reason why I recommend the DVD.  A lot of standup humor is funny the first time, but loses its edge.  Eddie's improves.  I laughed *more* the second time I saw it.

I was amazed by his ability to make a sidesplitting joke out of topics that no other comedian has even considered. Izzard's show is more than just funny; it is also a lesson in history and culture, but with a twist that only he can pull off.
The show runs about 1 hour and 40 minutes and is hilarious-not just funny-for the *entire* time. Some of my favorite highlights: He compares Hitler to a disgruntled painter who will ""kill them all"" when he can't get his trees drawn right. He pokes fun at our inability to recite our National Anthem. He says that Neil Armstrong couldn't have gotten out of the Apollo spacecraft and said ""Oh, it's all sticky!"" He impersonates Darth Vader with an English accent, discusses his experiences with ""the plague"" of puberty, insists that the Mormons ""really are from Mars,"" and elevates Shaggy and Scooby to some of the greatest literary characters of all time.
And that's not even the tip of the iceberg. Add to all of this Eddie's accent, his outrageous platform shoes, dress, hairstyle, lipstick, and the ways he contorts his face, and you have all the ingredients for the greatest stand up comedy show ever.
People who have seen Izzard's show end up quoting it on a daily basis, and just remembering certain lines is enough to make you chuckle for a few minutes. If you like stand up comedy, history, or you just want to laugh over and over again, add this show to your collection.
The DVD includes his show in Paris (in French), a photo documentary, and commentaries on both stand up shows, but the main attraction is the show itself. (100/100)",1046908800,,1678,4.578073089700997

  Eddie is the best history teacher I've had. His take on genesis, God, puberty, dictatorship, you name it, is fascinating. I have watched Dress to Kill, Glorious, and Definite Article about a million times each. I can recite the lines by heart. Does that stop me from watching it again? Take a guess!

With topics ranging from religion to relationships to the French, nothing is taboo for him to comment on. And the truly hilarious thing is his humor is contemplative in nature. You have to think about it sometimes (which Mr. Izzard heckles if he sees his audience take a moment to process). It's nasty stuff at times. Not nasty [sexual], but nasty human nature.
Heinlin wrote it best in 'Stranger in a Strange Land' when his main character discovered humor watching monkeys beat each other; you laugh to hide the horror of it. This is especially evident in Izzards takes on puberty and mass murderers. It takes a special kind of humorist to bring that out....",1046131200,3,840,4.8
1263806,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard is a brilliant, BRILLIANT comedian! He is very witty and intelligent (was that redundant?), and it shows. ""Dress to Kill"" is a hilarious show that will have you spilling your drinks on yourselves, and rolling all over the floor laughing.
I've had the pleasure of seeing Eddie perform his show, ""Circle"", live in Boston, MA. And, as with this taping of ""Dress to Kill"" in San Francisco, he spent a good deal of time talking about the location's history before he broke into the rest of his routine. You can immediately tell, he did his research and catered very well to his audience.
""Dress to Kill"" is a smorgasbord of historical facts laced with sharp humor. Eddie brushes upon some horrific facts and somehow make them sound so hysterically humorous with the way he tells his stories. Simply put, this man is a comic genius.
Not since Robin Williams' ""Live at the Met"" and Bill Cosby's ""Himself"" had I laughed so hard that I hurt myself. -- NT",1045872000,2,958,4.641176470588236

I really enjoyed the show he does in French.
His french is very poor but it was brave of him to try and he manages to entertain the crowd. His James Mason as God is a riot and is worth the price of admission alone.
You also get taught what an Executive Transvestite is.",1045699200,,516,4.019417475728155

I took a chance from the reviews on this site and purchased the DVD without ever hearing of him before.  I turned around and purchased two more of his CDs within weeks.
The opening with the streetcar scene in San Fran (sorry, ""The City"") is so droll, wonderful!  I could just listen to his lovely British accent all day.  However, his facial expressions and movements on stage are what really make me laugh.  I watch this DVD over and over again, never tiring of it.  I am so glad that I have discovered Eddie Izzard!!!",1045440000,,605,4.555555555555555

The DVD has many scenes that were cut for time from the special, as well as a french show (remember to turn on English Subtitles unless you speak the language).",1044921600,2,289,4.087719298245614

I had watched a 2nd-hand videotape of the HBO special so often, I found the difference in cadence and timing (of this recording) a bit distracting at first.
Nonetheless, this is a brilliant performance. One of the single greatest standup routines ever, and a must-have for stand-up comedy fans.
The 'extras' aren't anything to write home (or Amazon.com) about, save for the opening ""San Fransico"" bit. I want Mr. Izzard to narrate all of *my* home movies.",1044921600,2,584,4.85

1263872,5,B00003CWOT,"Eddie Izzard is an amazing performer. Not only is he intense, intelligent, and a really classy dresser, but he's absolutely hilarious! I have never laughed so hard in my entire life.
I bought the DVD after catching the last 10 minutes of a broadcast of it on HBO, and I was just dying to see what I had missed. I popped the DVD in the player practically frothing at the mouth with excitement...and suddenly, the laughs just started bursting out from everywhere! This DVD, from start to finish, is a GEM! Buy it! Stop reading my review, and just Buy it! Go! Get your credit card, and Buy it! Okay... Now, a word of caution: I suffer from asthma, and a really sour sense of humor, so until this point, I had never witnessed anything I found to be even remotely this funny before. Therefore, I was not prepared for the consequences of mixing laughter and asthma. Basically, about half an hour into the DVD, I had been laughing so hard, I was literally was having an asthma attack from all the hysterical laughter! So, I had to stop the DVD, CALM DOWN, get my inhaler, and wait a whole HOUR before I could start watching it again. Then, to my complete Joy/Horror, his routine continued to be so funny, my laughing started right up again and didn't even slow down till I ejected the DVD. Thusly, another asthma attack ensued. BUT I DIDN'T CARE! I was so overjoyed and enraptured with his performance, I would have died happy with my inhaler in my hand! Eddie's routine is so intelligent, so in-depth, and real, there is no one out there even remotely like him. And I didn't even give him credit for his great fashion sense, or the fact he's bilingual. The man, and the DVD are phenomenal! Don't deprive yourself of the best laughs of a lifetime! Buy it",1043539200,6,1747,4.4625
1263873,5,B00003CWOT,"This DVD showcases why Eddie Izzard is called by many the funniest man on the planet.  His material is laugh out loud, side splittingly funny.  He's also incredibly quotable.  His material ranges from explaining transvestism, the birth of the Church of England, Stonehenge, America's love affair with guns, Steve McQueen, and imperialism.  This DVD also includes material that was excised from his HBO special.  Why HBO cut it, I'll never understand because his riff on The Great Escape is hysterical.
I discovered Dress to Kill on HBO, and eventually taped it because I loved it so much.  Now, I'm thrilled to have the DVD.  Eddie is so literate and witty, I firmly believe just about anyone will laugh during his performance.  I have introduced Eddie to my friends, and they all thought he was fantabulous as well.

1263875,5,B00003CWOT,"Ok, he might not be the typical American comedian.  At that's exactly why I love him. In a sweet ""travesty executive"" way, he schools America on the rest of the world.  He brings history, international culture and politics into this stream-of-consciousness set that is absolutely 100% hysterical. The small lesson included is for America to wake up and learn a little bit more about the billions of other people in the world!  You know, France is right next to Venezuela and the hanging gardens of Babylon! Even on the slow times, he is so animated and funny to watch.  My boyfriend and I have found ourselves quoting this show a whole lot, from the splashy splashy to the french monkey on the branch, and don't forget freshly squeezed mango juice!",1042502400,,748,4.730769230769231

Originally aired as an HBO ""special,"" it was my first time to catch Eddie, and I was in pain/tears from laughter.  I'm a tough audience to please, esp. when it comes to comedians, but this show was a wonderful surprise, and to this day, one of my absolute favorites. If you've already bought this one, be sure to catch ""Definite Article"" as well. The latter starts out a bit slow, but boy, you'll be holding your sides with that, too.

THE DVD IS THE EXACT SAME CONCERT AS THE HBO SPECIAL. There is a difference, however, and it's a good one. There is 15 to 20 minutes of additional footage added in throughout the concert that HBO had edited out when they aired it.
That makes this 15 to 20 minutes better than what aired on TV. This is the funniest piece of stand-up available to the public.",1041984000,9,545,4.25

1263928,5,B00003CWOT,"This is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen.  I've been an insomniac for years, so I've watched a lot of the late-night HBO comedy programs.

When I was channel surfing one night, I came across this rather odd-looking gent on the boobtube, doing a routine that had me in stitches, with my sides aching from laughter.  Of course, I introduced the rest of my family to this lunatic as quickly as I could.  Shortly thereafter, I showed him to my friends.  We all fell in love with him.  He is brilliant.

It was entirely too long a wait till the DVD became available, but it's got even more material than the HBO special (and, contrary to an earlier review, has all the material from the HBO special)  It goes from having been about an hour and a half program (from HBO) to nearly 2 hours on the DVD.

If you aren't but you enjoy comedy that pokes fun at the institutions of religion and politics, and you aren't afraid to watch a man that looks great in heels, than this is for you.  One thing that I appreciate about his routine is that he focuses on things other than sex, the differences between the sexes, drugs and alcohol, and other tired jokes we've heard too many times.  He briefly and tastefully mentions his transvestite lifestyle to ease the audience into his feminine appearance.  After that, it's fresh, interesting material that will have you laughing so hard your jaw will hurt.",1041120000,4,797,4.624113475177305

1263933,5,B00003CWOT,"I saw this three years ago as a HBO Comedy special (a series as a whole they seem to have abandoned).  I remember it clearly - I was home from college, up at some godawful hour writing a term paper, and decided to watch some TV to relieve the boredom of the High Middle Ages.  All of a sudden I saw this British guy dressed in a full executive transvestite outfit, spitting out jokes about topics from the Druids building Stonehenge to the Protestant Reformation, to babies on spikes.  It was fun, it was irreverant, it was witty - it was all over the map!  The DVD is great, insofar as it includes some additional footage not released in the HBO special, especially the San Fransisco material.
One caveat - I don't know if it was my DVD player or a defect on the DVD itself, but at one point in the video, the movement freezes for a moment before switching to a completely new video angle - it almost seems like a editorial discontinuity, but it could have been the laser switching layers . . .",1040256000,2,995,4.304812834224599
1263934,5,B00003CWOT,"It is Eddie Izzard. A British-born comedian who's style of humor is educated and down to earth at the same time. From his views on the Anglican Faith, NRA, Scooby-Doo, christmas songs, Hitler, and Europe, Izzard has charm and wit that is often compared to that of American comic Robin Williams. The hour and thirty minutes that passes from his entrance to his encore, seems like 15 and afterwards, you will be quoting lines and wishing for more.
The first portion of his act that caught my eye was the infamous ""Cake or Death?"" senario. After a few times through, my friends and I began to speak in what I refer to as the Izzard-tongue: ""I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from."" and ""Ciao!"" and ""Jesus? Why you doing the big arms thing?"" and ""What are you? A bloody tank commander?"" Now that I practically have the entire act memorized, I feel that the best section is the part regarding the difference in British and American films: ""A Room With a View, With a Staircase And a Pond"" versus ""A Room With a View of Hell! Staircase of Satan! Pond of Death!"" (I'm into those subtle British films like that.)
Izzard is also a master of facial expression. Not so much as to say he is as animated as Jim Carrey, however his expressions, self-created sound effects, and elaborate gestures create a wonderful visually appealing act. The audio compact disc is good for driving in your car, but the DVD gives you the benefit of knowing just what those people are laughing at when Izzard isn't talking.
So, when you are out and about on your scooter in the south of Italy, putting babies on spikes, and listening to Engelburt Humperdink - pick up Eddie Izzard's Dressed to Kill. Just don't die laughing.",1040256000,3,1703,4.568627450980392

I saw Dress to Kill first on HBO and I loved it!  Where my disappointment comes in is this DVD wasn't his HBO performance.  In fact watching it this feels like the last leg of his tour and he was quite bored of it.  Eddie is at his best when he's enjoying himself.

""Lafayette, friend of Washington, cool guy--really!""  For me it's totally lost on my friends, so I enjoy it alone - but I do enjoy it!  OH! and he's a cross-dresser.  Like many, I thought, ""wierdo!""  But then I actually listened to him!  And I was sold.  Great concert.  Robin Williams in his most recent HBO special touches on the same subjects, but Eddie has a knowledge of what he's talking about that gives the impression he could begin a long, serious debate defending his topic.  He jokes with authority, or so it seems.  Williams jokes, while funny, don't convey that same sense of confidence.
If you like Eddie I urge you to discover Billy Connolly.  Back in 1992-3 he too had an HBO special that's seemingly lost to history.  But his other stand-up work is hilarious.

That is the genius of Eddie, is that he has a funny and cunning way to make us laugh at things we may actually believe.  While making generalized statements about many things  (poltics, religion, sex, etc), he is at times insightful, funny, and endearing, even if one may disagree with his point.
This is the work of a comic genius, to make us laugh while making us think.  Highlights of the act are his coments about the Church of England, the somberness of white Protestant hymms, and his first time having sex (or well, he thought he had sex).  There is a lot here to watch/listen and one will want to see it over because there is so much material.

And Robin Williams and Eddie Izzard are VERY close, sometimes I can't figure out which one I like better.  Izzard's comedic approach to world history is tear jerkingly hilarious.

My first exposure to Eddie Izzard was via a low quality VHS recording of HBO's one hour showcase, so I was excited about getting a clean copy for my collection.  This edition seems to be of another performance with a whole different technical video crew.  The cuts and shots are really strange at times, zooming out all the way from the back of the hall at critical moments of expression.  Plus the editing is a not as tight as I remember the special being.  There is a lot of Eddie pausing and staring into space for a moment to regain his placement in his act, something I do not recall seeing in the HBO version.  He also seemed to have a cold cause he would wipe his nose with his knuckle a lot.  These things might sound petty, but the viewing just didn't seem right.

The show itself accounts for about 1hr 50mins of the total running time and Izzard's distinctively surreal, flow-of-consciousness style never lets up.  The few jokes that fall flat do so due to audience stupidity.

I have struggled for years to try and describe him to people who've never seen him, and the closest I've got is by saying that he's like 'The Far Side' in person.  Squirrels, pigs, moon monsters, evil ducks, giraffe's who own dogs, the grim reaper with his updated lawnmower, all come alive in his videos.  Be prepared for comedy that doesn't run in straight lines, and keep your imagination handy at all times.

Unlike most comedians who come onto the scene with a bang and then spend the rest of their careers trying to live up to their earlier work, Izzard keeps his material fresh and funny.  His earlier shows are on par with the new ones.  If anything, his newer stuff is better.

Izzard has been hailed a comic genius in his native England for years, but the USA's exposure to him has been largely restricted to subpar movies like ""The Avengers"" and ""Mystery Men"".
This DVD should change all that.
Izzard skewers all things British, church-related, political, and cultural, but saves a lot of time to skewer himself (and Englebert Humperdinck, too).
This performance is laugh-out-loud funny all the way through, which is remarkable for a set that runs well over an hour.
Sure, you could rent this DVD instead of buying it.  But you're just gonna end up buying it anyway, so save yourself the rental fee you'd have ultimately wasted.

I saw Eddie live in Chicago a couple of years back and his show was very different (no drag) and just as amusing. If you ever get the chance to see him live do not pass up, he will satisfy the viewer who has a knowledge of history and world events.

1264052,1,B00003CWOT,"I caught this particular show a few years back on HBO whilst switchin' channels, and decided to stay tuned in just to see what this Eddie Izzard guy was all about. Sadly, it wasn't all about him being funny.  Except for his observation that most Star Wars villains are British (which in itself wasn't all that amusing), I found the man's act a an veritable bomberoo. I endured this pathetically unfunny piece of tripe from beginning to end without uttering so much as a soft chuckle. I found myself slowly slipping into a catatonic state of utter boredom as he doled out his insipid and pointless ramblings about Scooby-Doo, his lame spiel about coming up with an original sin, his ""cake or death"" bit that went nowhere fast, and his nodding-and-shaking-his-head dealy that he milked for some REALLY cheap laughs for about two minutes to punctuate some other pitiful bit of his.

In fact, the only laughing I heard was from the audience, and most likely polite laughter at that. You know, the kinda guffaws that come about when the audience doesn't actually think the man's jokes were funny, but they don't wanna bring him down? Yeah, now you know what I mean! I know if I were an audience member watching this coma-inducing roll of wall-to-wall lameness, I'd've stormed the box office threatening to sue if I didn't get a full refund!

The only time I had even an inkle of emotional reaction to this travesty was when I sighed in relief as the closing credits rolled. A few minutes later, however, I became depressed when I realized I just wasted an hour of my life watching this heapin' load o' dreck! I'd've had a better time listening to the recitation of the minutes from the British Parliament's last session than watching this loser!

Then there's the whole dressing in drag thing, which is pretty much clich nowadays. Personally, I think it's his way of kissing up to the original British comedy drag-sters, Monty Python's Flying Circus (of course, his claim will be that his cross-dressing is a `tribute' to the Pythons, but I see right through that ploy!). If you doubt it, take a look at his little walk-on with MPFC's five surviving members at the beginning of the `Life of Python' interview special. C'mon, now, Edward; stop licking the boots of those has-beens! Just because the late Graham Chapman is funnier deceased than you will ever be while you're alive doesn't mean you shouldn't try to be your own man(?)!

UPDATE 3/20/2005:

Now I know what some of you are thinking after reading my little rant: you see me as some sorta anti-intellectual rube who just doesn't ""get"" most of Mr. Izzard's material, don'cha? You probably think that most of his references and allegedly humorous takes on significant events in European history (i.e. the Crusades) sailed right over my pointy little pin-head, don'cha? It probably didn't even remotely occur to you that perhaps I did grok just about every last bit of this man's so-called ""humor""... which I did, BTW... and I just didn't think it was funny? I know this is a tough revelation to wrap your brain around, but just try it. Don't be scared, now...

Then there are a few of you who're saying to yourselves, ""Ahh, he's just some disgruntled Yank who's biased against British comedy!"" Sorry to disappoint you, but I consider Are You Being Served? to be one of the funniest sitcoms ever made, and I rather enjoy the weirdness of Monty Python's Flying Circus, Fawlty Towers, and The Black Adder. The late Benny Hill had his moments as well! And to top things off: ""Danger Mouse"" was one of my all-time fave cartoon shows when I was but a wee 'Norch!

Others of you are thinking, ""Ahhh, the guy's just jealous of Izzard's success."" True, I must admit I am rather envious of this no-talent yutz who has managed to break into show biz and has been modestly successful at it... well, if you consider small parts in Mystery Men and the cinematic adaptation of The Avengers to be a couple of sturdy rungs up the ladder to the big time... while being completely unfunny. Going by that logic, I am also very jealous of Paulie Shore!

Finally, there're those of you who are saying to yourselves: ""Sheesh, this guy's a real scumbag!""

My reply to this: your point being...?

1264053,5,B00003CWOT,"Watch Dress to Kill and you'll know what the title for my review means
There are actually 5 Eddie Izzard stand up concerts out on the old video cassettes (in UK). Dress To Kill, his San Francisco gig, is the only one available on DVD so far. This openly transvestite man is arguably the best British stand up comic today. His material is very Monty Python-ish. If you like the Pythons, you'll like Eddie. If you don't like the Pythons, try Eddie anyway. You'll end up with stomach cramps from all the laughing. I did.
By the way, the 5 videos of his concerts are: Live at the Ambassador's, Unrepeatable, Definite Article, Glorious and Dress to Kill. They're all great. I hope they all come out in DVD soon.",1035331200,29,706,4.48062015503876
1264054,5,B00003CWOT,"I have been waiting YEARS for this to come out!
This is the best stand-up routine by him thus far.  Eddie's showcases his genius by pontificating and poking fun at everything from religion to history to pop culture.
Hilights are:
 ""Do You Have a Flag"" bit wherein he breaks down English colonialism for you sort of The British Empire for Dummies.
""Europeans"" where he describes Italians, French, English and so on with such biting wit..it's uncanny.
All of his religious bits are as usual, hilarious. When he does God in a James Mason voice, you had better have some oxygen handy.
Eddie is seriously underrated, for now, but I am sure once this hits the DVD players of the States he will be very, very well known and not as just another pretty face, in heels, who's a guy.",1034985600,21,772,4.546762589928058

1264128,5,B00003CWOT,"I saw Eddie Izzard during his Dress To Kill tour, at the Westbeth Theater in New York City.  We loved his blend of contemporary riffs and historical references, conducted at a breakneck pace.  His routine is marked by asides, audience interaction, and sudden veering tangents from his narrative-of-the-moment.  We were so impressed we returned two weeks later to see where his current whims would take his performance.  We were shocked and impressed to see the exact same show, beat for beat.  What we thought was improvisation was in fact deliberately constructed.  Izzard's truly original comic themes, carefully crafted presentation and underlying professionalism, combine to make a memorable comic event.  The HBO special was a treat - it pales in comparison to the live performance, but still rates as an evening well spent.  Live or recorded, Eddie Izzard is a must-see performer.",1032825600,,886,5.23404255319149
1264129,5,B00003CWOT,"To say that Eddie is a genius would be an understatement. His routine will take you to area of thought that is totally bizarre yet totally obvious on reflection. Time and time again I've watched his performances and still crease in laughter.
Not only is the humour intelligent and diverse it's all clean and original.
Every video of him is brilliant but I would reccommend a performance called Unrepeatable. The sketch about the differences between cats and dogs is a masterpeice of observation. In London he's  a cult hero on the comedy circuit and his videos usually hit the top ten on release. He's apparently touring again in 2003 so if you get the chance, seem him live. A rare treat indeed.
Alternatively pick a nice bottle of wine and sit down in front of the video. A perfect surreal evening.",1028851200,,800,4.673758865248227
1264130,5,B00003CWOT,"In Eddie Izzard's book, also called ""Dress to Kill,"" the comedian talks about meeting Robin Williams.  He was so honored because Mr. Williams, one of America's ultimate performers, said he was very funny.  I've known this since the first time I saw Eddie on ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" and the fact was most certainly reaffirmed by watching D2K.
This was Eddie's big American break, an HBO special geared to a fickle audience that frequently cries out for originality.  This laugh-a-minute fest was just what they needed.  Eddie not only makes us think about our world (topics like war, religion, and gun control), but he finds humor in unexpected places (such as the Heimlich manuever, the moon landing).  He can also laugh at himself and his own country.  Apparently, the UK is cleaning the windows of the European car.
What separates him from many comedians today (and links him with Mr. Williams in a way) is his unstoppable energy and the lively characterization he puts into every word.  It amazes me that he performed for an entire hour without one sip of water!  He commands attention and his audience hangs on the whole time.
His Emmy award wins for this special almost guarantee him another go on HBO, if that's what he wants.  For the sake of American audiences who are unfamiliar with his previous shows, I hope he takes the stage again.  His fanbase can only continue to grow.
Funny parts to look for in this video:  the transvestite airborne wing, Sean Connery as the ""big hairy king,"" the French lesson, the druids and Stonehenge, weirdo transvestite vs. executive transvestite, Engelbert Humperdinck, and the real way to say ""leisure.""

I didn't really remember him, but slowly he started popping up everywhere on cable, including a (staged) crashing of Monty Python's induction at the Apsen Comdey Festival.
Then one night, I caught his HBO special, ""Dressed to Kill,"" and laughed so hard it hurt. Eddie has an amazing skill of blending history, religion and his own personal experiences into a hillarious two-hour stream-of-consciousness. I have watched the special several times (I got smart enough to tape it) and each time I catch a new joke or bit that I missed last time. He is one of the funniest stand up comics I've ever seen and his observations are always dead on.

I borrowed a copy of the video for a class (on the rhetoric of humor -- what's funny, why use humor, humor telling truths (I am a doughnut) that the world might not be ready acknowledge). Remember the 1977 Saturday Night Live skits with Garrett Morris and Richard Pryor on race relations?

I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it and every time I still laugh. In fact, he was on the other night on HBO and I still had to watch the whole thing.
For those of you not familiar with him, Izzard is a transvestite who engages in a type of comedy that is more of a one-man show than a stand-up routine. While one might think that his tranvestism would be the main focus of the show, it isn't. While he uses it as a point of comedy briefly, the show really focuses on what it is like to live in this world. The show is a satirical look at cultures and history. He mocks nearly all western Europeans, and then reminds us that we native English speakers perhaps miss out on a whole view of the world because we are so constricted by our language. In addition, he also attacks law and politics and our American tradition of not knowing any world history.
Yet, while his humor addresses pretty heady material, don't be fooled into believing that it is inaccessible or overwrought with discussion. This is not an NPR comedy special. This is bare bones hard humor that keeps you rolling in the isle each time you watch. My only regret is that it isn't available on DVD or VHS. Until then, go see it if you can in a theater. If you want something now, I would highly recommend Glorious, an earlier show done in England in which Izzard discusses the Bible. It is a classic as well.

His comedy is one which spans everything from history to religion to loosing your virginity, and I personaly promise you will laugh at every moment of it! His wit, his physical comedy with his hilarious facial expressions combined with the fact his doing this all the while in heels (and he looks perfectly comfortable doing so!!) make  for a unique and unforgettably funny show I think more people ought to see. So, keep an open mind and I promise you will LOVE Eddie!!",976492800,3,622,4.553571428571429
1264307,5,B00003CWOT,"This is simply the funniest comedic piece I've ever seen.  Eddie Izzard manages the most hillarious comedic act without the assistance of props, funny backgrounds, or exagerated facial expressions like many other popular comedians simply because such additions would detract from his amazingly spectacular performance.  I originally taped this when it came on HBO, and I've since shown it to everyone I know, and we all agree it's fabulous from the first time you watch to the twentieth.  Anyone who dismisses this show is truly missing out.",975715200,4,541,5.195402298850575
1264308,5,B00003CWOT,"I read an article about Izzard and in it the author described him as ""Richard Pryor meets Monty Python."" This is accurate to some degree, however much more must be said about how amazingly talented Izzard is. Watching him on stage is like sitting in a jazz club watching Miles Davis wail away on his trumpet, brilliance just flows from him. His type of material isn't for the narrow-minded, nor those who fell asleep in history class. He blends his astonishing wit with historical fact and social taboos seemlessly, and James Mason as God is one of the most hysterically funny bits I've ever seen. This is an amazing stand up performance that you will never get tired of.",973036800,,671,4.647058823529412
1264309,5,B00003CWOT,"I saw D2K on HBO and recorded it.  Now I intend on buying it.  He is amazingly funny.  It's so much fun waiting to see what's going to pop out of his mouth next, and what expression will go along with it.  I have watched it over and over and never tire of it.  If u haven't heard of him or seen any of his stuff you are truely missing out.  Go watch him, now!  He is well worth the time and you will not be sorry.  His comedy is off the wall and he says things that you normally wouldn't think made sense, but he pulls it off masterfully.  And above all,  it will make you laugh.",971654400,,579,3.830508474576271
1264379,5,B00003CWOT,"One of the best things in life is great humor, and Eddie is at the top of my list after catching his ""Dressed To Kill,"" on HBO.  Many people have already given on-the-mark reviews, so I'll skip the specifics of what makes this video so funny.  Suffice to say that whenever I need to raise my spirits with a great belly laugh, I pop in this video.  There are a few benefits to watching Eddie on video: 1. You can rewind and watch it again and again and again.  2.  You can turn on closed captioning and catch every word.  3.  You get close-ups of Eddies facial expressions which are priceless.  It is one of the best parts of his comedy--his subtle body language.  It gets funnier every time I watch it.",971222400,4,702,4.257575757575758
1264380,5,B00003CWOT,"I highly recommend any of Eddie's shows and his movies are quite enjoyable as well.  D2K is, like all his stuff, brilliant.  But I warn you, the man's work is addictive and you run the risk of drawing lots of parallels between the show and your life which makes for a lot of laughs but some weird looks from those not in the know.  If you ever get the chance to see him live, go for it!  I did and am now anxiously awaiting the release of ""Circle""...",970099200,,450,4.079545454545454
1264381,5,B00003CWOT,"Everyone should rent this incredible performance video!  Izzard blends pop culture, world history, and anything else he can get his hands on, and creates an intensely funny stand-up.  One of the funniest comedians I've seen in a long time.  Sort of like Dennis Miller crossed with Steve Martin crossed with Robin Williams.  Brilliant!",969494400,,334,5.245283018867925
1264382,2,B00003CWOT,"After ""Glorious"" and ""Unrepeatable"", this comes as a  major disappointment. Izzard is capable of so much better than the materal  presented here. I got the distinct impression that he was ""dumbing  down"" his act for an American audience, i.e., much of this seems  downright patronizing. For example, the Englebert Humperdink and Heimlich  Manuever material is painfully unfunny right from the start, and it's  inclusion seems to be soley for the reason that even Americans will have  heard of them.
The first 20 minutes has some decent laughs, but then  Eddie loses the plot and bumbles along for the remainder of the show.
To  be fair, all of Eddie's shows tend to be hit-or-miss. On a good night, he's  quite literally glorious, on a bad night he's merely diverting.",968630400,6,768,4.9296875

I had never seen or heard of Eddie Izzard before that time but I  don't intend to miss any of his performances, if, and when he plays around  the New York area.  He is brilliant.

1264385,5,B00003CWOT,"I had the the chance to see ""Dress to Kill"" on HBO and Eddie  immediately became my favorite stand-up comedian.  He has a wonderfully  fresh and unique approach to stand-up comedy.  I've seen ""Dress to  Kill"" several times and laugh louder every time.  I've raved about  Eddie to all of my friends who have access to HBO, and insisted that he is  a MUST SEE.  He's ""Fantabulous!""",961804800,,379,4.537313432835821

EDDIE IS  BRIGHT, FUNNY, IRREVERANT AND OF COURSE, A FABULOUS DRESSER. THE SHOW IS SO  FUNNY I FIND MYSELF MEMORIZING MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID AND I JUST LAUGH OUT  LOUD SOME TIMES WITH THE RECOLLECTIONS.

I  eventually taped it and have since watched it with everyone I know - a  major hit for all types (not necessairly for the under 18 crowd, however).  Eddie's humor about history, politics, and religion offer a refreshingly  educated and hilarious perspective. An absolute ""must-see"" for  any fan of comedy.",959817600,,446,5.041095890410959

I saw  this on HBO and just had to tape it the next time it was on. Whether he's  playing Sean Connery (as Henry VIII eventhough he is scottish) or James  Mason (playing GOD with Jessey Creesey) or giving you the entire plot of  ""Speed"" in french (you don't even want to know) he is truly one  of the comic geniuses out there.

His facial  expressions, body language, ad lib material, historical & cultural  knowledge will all blow you away.

This self-styled  'executive transvestite' is quite possibly the funniest stand-up comedian  I've seen.  He dances about both physically and verbally, assaulting your  comedy center with jabs and pokes that will make you laugh because they are  so true.  Do you know your history?  Eddie does, and he'll make you laugh  at Hitler.  (yes, you will) Buy it, and enjoy.  You might need to get to  the loo before you start.....",955756800,7,548,4.763440860215054

It was the first Eddie show  I'd ever seen but I had not laughed so hard, so frequently in years.  I  just loved the way he took little potshots at royalty, the NRA, the  Crusades, evil incarnate Adolf Hitler, and so forth.  ""God attack the  Queen, send big dogs after her that bite her bum,"" reverberates in my  head along with "" . .. and fish in the sky and a big . . . monkey  pie.""

The show is  masterfully woven with a number of reoccuring bits some subtle, some  obvious, and some spoken in French.  Religion, politics, puberty and a  plethera of other topics-all covered while wearing heels.
