2328443,1,B0009WIE3Y,"This badly reviewed, low rated stinkbomb is the worst series in HBO's whole history.  Mike Binder incredibly got to star in it because he's a best friend of Chris Albrecht, the head of HBO, whose other buddy, Robert Wuhl, also stunk up the joint with the horrific ""Arliss.""  If it were possible to erase DVD discs, then these all would be blank.  Call this show, ""The Downside of Binder.""",1126656000,5,388,4.594202898550725

No more than this needs to be said about this series. Ever.

2328445,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I'm not giving the DVD a 5 star rating, as it hasn't been released yet. I'm coming over to Amazon after I was unable to find any MOTMM merchandise at HBO.COM (sad). A quick GOOGLE and here I am. I'm really rating the show. I was really disappointed to learn that it was cancelled. I just loved the show, and I can't wait to relive it on DVD.

For what it's worth HBO, I would rather have seen a new season of MOTMM rather than the introduction of Carnival!",1122854400,6,456,4.123595505617978
2328446,5,B0009WIE3Y,"This was a show that HBO shut down way too soon!!!!  Co-workers and I would congregate around the water cooler to talk about the previous nights episode.  Now HBO has Period-Pieces of some historical relevance...a shame.

But, everyone should enjoy this show.  Its not just about the main character.  Its about his circle of married and single friends as well.  Enjoy.",1121990400,20,368,4.950819672131147
2328467,5,B0009WIE3Y,"This is a great series. Many other reviews emphasis the reasons why very well. I simply want to know, HBO: Why hold out altogether on putting out some kind of release for Season 2? I'm sure anyone who purchased and enjoyed Season One would be glad to fork over some hard earned cash to own the rest of the series. I for one have NEVER SEEN the second season and would love to at least have the opportunity to do so! PLEASE make it happen and bring this series fans what we want... The rest!",1289174400,5,490,4.168421052631579
2328468,5,B0009WIE3Y,"This is a great season series and worth a look. Apparently, it didn't do too well in sales and there was no distribution of season 2. If anyone has heard any different please let me know.",1287705600,,187,4.222222222222222
2328469,4,B0009WIE3Y,"Chicago reporter Micky is the main character in this HBO series.  He is continually envious of his colleague Joe (Jake Weber) who is a successful serial adulterer in his office.  Although most married men may think about the same things, with adultery near the top of the list, this show's characters all behave differently in whether they act on the ideas and fantasies coursing through their minds.  Like most HBO shows, this one goes the distance in covering the territory it wants to cover and doesn't need to worry about censorship, like network tv does, with sexuality being at the core of the show.  One thing this show covers extremely well is that once you become in enmeshed in lying to your spouse, how lying to everyone insinuates itself into the entirety of your life. Even if you ""get away"" with the adultery, being a continual liar day in and day out exacts its own excruciating toll. I found this show to be more of a drama than a comedy but perhaps you need to be a married man to appreciate the comedy in the series.  Be warned: This show may be painful to watch if adultery ruined your own marriage as it develops this core theme relentlessly.

P.S. One amusing part to the show is seeing how primitive the computers were which we were using in 2001.

2328470,3,B0009WIE3Y,"I made the very bad mistake of assuming that anything produced by HBO would be to my liking.  In this case, I really didn't read enough about the plot and premise of this series, which I later found would clearly appeal more to viewers younger than myself and more attuned to a raunchy satire on sexual mores and goings-on among the well-to-do and up-and-rising urban professional class.  If you fit that category, you will definitely enjoy this series.",1271030400,3,453,4.794871794871795
2328471,5,B0009WIE3Y,I was fortunate enough to watch the show when it aired on HBO. It was wonderful. I hate seeing New shows out here on DVD that are just a waste of time and not have the other seasons Of this series released. This show was amazing a look into the life of a true man and get to see what is happening in his head. HBO should run and release the rest of the seasons and fast.....,1226534400,,374,3.8701298701298703
2328472,5,B0009WIE3Y,"This is a great show, that found completely by luck. I bought this DVD at Big Lots for $3 in their assorted DVD bin; if only the other seasons has been released on DVD.....?. happy hunting. : )",1223510400,2,193,4.105263157894737
2328473,5,B0009WIE3Y,"my husband and i found this at Ross the other day... we're recently married and thought it would be funny to watch. I've never heard of the show before until i saw the dvd... we watched the first disc last nite and we were hooked! it is def. a show for guys, but still funny nonetheless. it totally reminded me of sex & the city, but guy version. yeah theres some nudity, cussing, etc... all the same things you see on satc. I'm sad to see that there's no way to get the season 2 dvd... did it even come out??",1219622400,,509,4.0495049504950495
2328474,4,B0009WIE3Y,"MOMM was killed by women because men enjoyed it. Period. This show was axed because men derived adulterated pleasure from it. Because it was meant for men. And because women just couldn't take it that men could enjoy something without women's blessings.

I used to watch MOMM together with my wife on HBO back in New Delhi, India. From the very first episode I realised this was going to be a mindblowing experience. I used to latch on to every word that the characters spoke. It was amazing, like I was seeing myself walk and speak on screen. I sometimes felt exposed and naked, but in a good way. Often I'd wish my wife was not watching because Binder was so open and honest.

Sadly, my wife's reaction, on the other hand, was hostile. She used to call men ""bastards"", or some other expletive, during the show. I would sometimes chuckle (I used to be a tolerant husband then), sometimes be exasperated at her behaviour and other times I would tell her: ""See I'm not the only person who thinks or acts like that. Even American men, and men worldwide do that!""

Of course, she would simply say men are sick. She would shake her head and would act like she was lapsing into some sort of depression!

I noticed that there were very few ads during MOMM, which in an ad-ad-ad country like India, was a sure sign of low ratings. Obviously, companies decided they could not sell women's hygiene products, cooking oil, detergent and other stuff because their target audience was long asleep (it was shown at 11pm on a Thursday).

I guess, women in America are too powerful when it comes to media influence. It is sad this serial went down the tube. On the other hand look at the hype over Sex & the City. This ran considerably longer than MOMM in India. As an impartial viewer, I can say Sex and the City was basically the same thing. Except that it was from a woman's point of view. And how that view was accepted in the popular media and by the public! The episode on the Manolo Blahniks (i don't even care i spelled it right) was pure disgust. Carrie was practically a prostitute after she used the money that the French executive threw on her after a night with her. But this was all acceptable despite the fact that it is highly improbable someone would be so lucky in real life.

There were no frothing-at-the-mouth feminists waving placards at HBO execs. Nobody minded that women were being shown as totally shallow. The reason was simple: women loved it, which sent the ratings up.

I hope there is some backlash from the male lobby at some stage so that men can have shows like MOMM, so they can enjoy them, record them, re-play them again and again... without being labelled perverts.",1213142400,7,2687,4.516460905349795
2328475,4,B0009WIE3Y,"I ran across this on DVD, having never been aware of its existence on HBO. After watching the first episode or two, I began to find the characters and their relationships really funny and interesting and it kept me wanting more.

Although there are at least a couple scenes to chuckle at, I couldn't help but feel sad for each of the couples as the show explores the insecurities, pain, and lonliness that infidelity and dishonesty can bring to marriage. Unfortunately, most of the situations aren't all that unrealistic in today's society.

I almost bought a copy for one of my soon to be married girl friends, but after watching it I realized that would be a very bad idea, haha!  It doesn't exactly portray marriage as the MOST desireable experience. Watch with caution, don't let it trick you into thinking that all marriages are destined to float over a deep underlying unhappiness. I did find the characters overall loveable even though I felt sorry for them, though.

For mature audiences only, if you're offended by nudity and sexual situations find something else to watch.",1212364800,2,1082,4.832432432432433
2328476,5,B0009WIE3Y,I loved this show (extremely funny and well written) and was quite sad to see it go away.  I have to agree with other reviews that it does provide a pretty candid glimpse into the mind of the married/committed man (so be careful with any potential viewing partner).  It would be nice to see it come back but if not I would at least like the option of purchasing season two.,1189123200,,373,4.23943661971831
2328487,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I thought it was a good show.  Witty writing, good acting.  Worse shows have been allowed to go on for many seasons--this one only got two.  Hope the second season comes out soon.

For those who complain about the adult content--When a DVD is rated ""Not Rated""  or ""Unrated"" or is produced by HBO it usually is not something to watch with the kids.",1167004800,2,348,4.375
2328488,5,B0009WIE3Y,"This show was the one of the best on HBO ever.  I like Entourage but MOMM is better.  My wife loved watching it too.  If FOX brought back Family Guy after they canceled it, then HBO should do the right thing and bring Mind of the Married Man back.  We only subscribe to HBO when the Sopranos are on.  After the final Sopranos each season we cancel, only renewing when the new season starts up again.  After the final season we'll never subscribe again, unless they bring Mind of the Married Man back.",1166140800,2,500,4.32258064516129
2328489,5,B0009WIE3Y,"What ever you do, don't watch this with your wife or girlfriend.  For her it's only another excuse to argue with you.  Watch it with your fellow male friends only.  Warning: This series is so true that your woman will hate you for it.",1165190400,4,234,4.2727272727272725
2328490,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I thought this was one of the best shows I'd ever seen, and like other watchers I patiently (or not so patiently) waited for season 3.  Alas, it didn't ever come around, which is a real shame because I thought this was a really insightful, mature and funny piece of work.  I'm so glad it is at least available for purchase!",1149552000,5,323,4.278688524590164
2328491,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I saw the show on HBO when it first came out.  Even started taping them.  I loved it. My wife loved it!  This show was and is so much better than Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Seriously.  The only reason a show like this is NOT on primetime tv, is the use of language and sex.  But honestly, given it is on HBO(CABLE) and not on regular tv, the people that are offended should just shut up and relax.  That is WHY we have ratings!  TV-MA!!  Read it and relax.  The show is an earlier version of Nip/Tuck, without the FX Network and without real nudity and without the Doctors!

The show should be conitnued.  I hope it will be.  It was funny, smart, serious and DEAD ON!  Men think this way.  Women act that way.  The only reason it wouldn't make it again, is peope don't want to see, THEIR life on screen!

It is too real!  we all know someone or someone(s) like this guy and his friends.  Their wives.  Their ideas, jobs, kids, and LIVES!

So, watch it. Enjoy it. And to the stuck up out there, Get a life and a FUNNY BONE!

I still laugh at the Wuiji Board and Magic Cupcake joke Mikey says to the Psychologist!

2328492,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I loved this show when it was on HBO.

Yes it has language and nudity but it is an ADULT show and aired on HBO!!!

I wish this show would have lasted.

I hope season 2 will be put on DVD ;o)

Being a woman I sometimes cringed at this....but loved getting a guys point of view and laughed at seeing myself in some of the scenes.

Bottom line this is just a funny show from a mans point of view",1139356800,8,392,3.7901234567901234
2328493,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I think it was a shame that this show had to end.  I kept waiting patiently for the 3rd season to start and it never happened.  I heard that part of the reason the show never came back after season 2 was the very sad passing of Bruce Paltrow.

I thought this show was a real find though.  Yes there is nudity.  Yes there is cussing.  It's HBO.  Hello!!!!!  I think this show is a welcome addition to the DVD collection of people comfortable enough with the subject of sex and with there own sexuality to laugh at it.

I read somewhere that someone broke the DVDs after watching them b/c it was 'vulger' - that's a tad over-dramatic don't ya think?!

The show told the truth.  Maybe the truth that some people don't want to know -  about what goes on in the minds of men.  Not all men mind you.  There was the good husband, the bad husband, and the mediocre husband on the show.  Most of us ladies hope we end up with the 'good husband,' but you just never know what's going on in the minds of those men.  All in all a welcome glance into a world i so seldom understand or get to experience.  Thanks again Mike Binder!",1134950400,6,1117,4.144859813084112
2328494,5,B0009WIE3Y,"First this was one of the funniest series I had ever seen. Every episode was hilarious. Man, I do I miss seeing Sonja Walger every week. Perfect wife, mother, and man what an English temper. Well it was also revealed that this series debuted on 9/11/01. I guess America was not ready for a bunch

of horny married men enjoying nice conversations around the bar

2328495,1,B0009WIE3Y,"I bought this series because of loving ""Upside of Anger"".  It was unrated and no mention of the extreme offensive vulgar language and material.  I watched the first five minutes, broke the CD's and threw them in the garbage.  Within the first five minutes was pornography shown, and the F-bomb dropped several times in an extremely vulgar context.  There should at least be some warning of the material in this series for anyone who has any scrupples or concerns for our culture and society, or what they fill their minds.  This was the worst money I ever spent!  No wonder I could not rent or find this series in any store.",1127779200,3,624,4.576576576576577
2328496,5,B0009WIE3Y,"I didn't give this show much of a chance when it first came on but ended up watching a few and got totally hooked.  I had missed much of the first season, so recently I bought the 2 DVD set.

I must say that this series has gotten many very negative reviews and only lasted two seasons, but one thing I didn't know till I got the DVDs and listened to Binder and Walgner talk about the show was that it premiered  on 9/11/2001, it never had a hope.  It was upstaged by the biggest event of the new century.

After watching the whole DVD series I can say that this show did have a lot of heart.  This struggle for a married man (of which I am one) to remain happy and loyal when opportunity runs rampant in his life is one I can relate to.  Mickey has it all, a good job, smart perky wife who he obviously loves, but he is constantly tempted and pushed into outside relationships by his friends, hot young assistant, and his own insecurity.

I think Binder did an effective job of getting us married men thinking about all the crap that goes around in our heads every day.  I'm not saying the acting or writing were Emmy quality, but it was a good, intriguing show and should be recognised as such.",1126742400,29,1196,4.187772925764192
