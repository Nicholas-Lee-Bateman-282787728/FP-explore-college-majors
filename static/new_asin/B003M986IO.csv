4155079,3,B003M986IO,"Ever since the documentary film ""Spellbound"" about the National Spelling Bee was nominated for an Oscar in 2003 - and became the darling of the Film Festival set, filmmakers have been recording competitions and making films about the stress to practice and win. There have been similar films on crossword puzzles (Wordplay) and ballet tryouts. And many on piano competitions. This one concerns itself with the annual International Harp Competition held in Bloomington Indiana. At this competition 32 harpists from around the world compete in a 10-day competition to win a harp valued at $55,000.

This PBS release was produced by Indiana Public TV for national PBS airing and has a lot of local sponsors. It follows the competitors from their arrival to the conclusion and shows them in public as well as private moments.

Those interested in classical music will enjoy the film - I did - but it will mean the most to those who play the harp (I don't). The bonus features are short films on both the making of the prize harp and a guide on choosing a harp and having it repaired. This is just a little TOO esoteric for the average viewer.

For a harpist this probably deserves five stars; for the casual viewer, just three.

8400234,5,B003M986IO,Wow--you will be impressed.  Quite a competition. Well done video.,1483142400,,66,5.6
8400235,5,B003M986IO,"For any aspiring musician, but especially for harpists, this is inspirational, a reality check, and an interesting look at the competition process.  For me, the biggest ""take aways"" were the realistic contextual comments of the judges.  One saying that on a different day, on a different instrument, the same contestants could have been in different placements, and another recognizing that these contests are ""not for everyone,""  that there are very fine musicians who simply do not excel in the contest environment.  It also shows how one community has become a ""host"" for this event in a variety of ways.  Informative and worth many viewings.",1449619200,,645,5.163461538461538
8400236,5,B003M986IO,Excellent demonstration of musical ability by participants.  Brief views of the Indiana University-Bloomington campus and its Musical Arts Center bring fond memories.,1386633600,,166,6.545454545454546
8400237,3,B003M986IO,"While this was artfully presented and very informative, I was hoping for more of a concert than a documentary.  The music was sprinkled throughout, but not what I was expecting - which was a final full concert of the contestants' performance.  Still, it was interesting and the contestants were wonderful.",1356566400,2,305,5.08
8400238,5,B003M986IO,"I think this video was beautifully done. When this was to air on PBS, my harp teacher highly recommended it to watch.

I enjoyed the walk through of the preparation for competitions, the music, experiences and interviews with teachers,competitors and judges. It gives a chance to see each of the competitors, their backgrounds, their thoughts and goals. I really enjoyed the Finalist performances. And even the Finalist that finally won, I actually  purchased the CD of the winner. I don't want to share who it is, so not to spoil it for those who have not seen this video.  But I really recommend getting this video.  You can get a preview of it on youtube.com - [...]

I will add that I am an adult harper, who is learning to play the Lever harp.  After I watched this video on PBS I knew I had to purchase it. And from then on I have watched it several times. I am greatly inspired by it. Anytime practicing becomes a battle, I look at this video and all of a sudden practicing the harp becomes more enjoyable. (I'm very impressionable) This is a video that definitely says that hard work is totally worth it.",1332460800,4,1112,4.48019801980198
8400239,4,B003M986IO,"...a little too much talk and narrative relative to the music and especially, jumpy interruptions of the music in favor of yet more talk and intercut vignettes of the competitors.  I also would have liked more in the movie itself about the mechanics and complexities of the harp instrument.  The movie did touch on that but not enough.  (I viewed it on Netflix streaming, hence did not have access to the harp-extras that might be on the DVD).  These cavils aside, I completely agree with the positive comments of the other reviewers.  A very worthwhile film to see!  Bonus:  the finale featured adequate portions of the concluding competition concerto piece, Gabriel Pierne's Op. 39 Concerto for Harp and Orchestra, a lush and lyrical work with which I was unfamiliar but will get to be.",1324425600,,788,4.835820895522388
8400240,5,B003M986IO,"I loved this documentary!  The playing was grand and beautiful but most of all I learned about playing this most difficult instrument (an ancient one at that) and the work that must be accomplished to compete at this level.  I knew very little about the instrument, the rep. and the players but this was so interesting and educational that I savored each moment.  The prize harp was truly an awesome creation.  Highly recommended if you love stories of beauty, dedication and reward and classical music. Just watch and enjoy!!",1314662400,2,526,4.876404494382022
8400241,4,B003M986IO,"I saw this film on PBS and already knew I liked it. An inspiration to ""do your best"" at whatever you do.",1310169600,,104,3.772727272727273
8400242,5,B003M986IO,"Wonderful documentary for classical music fans and casual viewers alike. Out of 32 young contestants still studying/beginning their careers, after the rounds of filtering out the best of the best, three of them will have the opportunity to play concerto with the orchestra, and they will of course win the third,second, and the first price, and the winner gets the stunning harp, specially made for the winner of the competition. The instrument is stunning, made of 1500 parts, partially gilded and carved, worth $55 000). We follow some of the contestants,as they prepare for the competition at their schools, (takes 2-3 years to prepare and the repertoire is very demanding), also we follow them at the hosts families homes and at the competition, hear why they love harp, (this instrument is their life-long comitemment)their self-evaluations about their performances during the competition itself, etc. The is also a lot of interesting info about competitions itself, making of the harp, we see how the teachers work with the contestants, at music conservatories. Some info may come as a surprise for people who are not too familiar with harp: playing a harp is hard work requiring a lot of stamina and poise, even is looks so aethereal, and that harp is not such demure instrument as commonly believed, you can play any type of music, and harp has unusual wide range of sounds.

The documentary is smooth as harp music, there is no drama when some contestants are not chosen for higher level, no reality TV kind of stuff. Because classical musicians who are preparing for their careers, need to be have nerves of steel, and poise in addition to virtuoso skills and fine presence on the stage. Of course the main treat is to hear and see the contestants performing. All are fine. An d of course, we have our favorites in such movies. i had one during the final round, she won, had tears in her eyes, but no beauty-pageant-type show of emotions. I confess, I got tears in my eyes too... After the credits she was saying with teary eyes :""this is my harp?"" Visual side of this price harp captivated me too. And the final pieces is a concerto with orchestra, which is a real treat, as you don't hear too often harpists performing with orchestras,(piano concertos are more common).So, enjoy the movie, enjoy the music.",1292457600,2,2318,4.838790931989925
8400243,5,B003M986IO,"I would disagree that this is esoteric (even as a mother of a harpist).  As mentioned in the documentary preparation for this sort of career making competition is akin to being in an Olympic final in terms of the preparation, skill and nerve required.  You get to see competitors in their home (or adopted home) environment, their teachers views on them and on competitions in general and their journey to perform in one of the largest harp competitions in the world.  Anyone can appreciate this and as for the making of the prize harp (1500 moving parts in the mechanism all hand crafted, 100 hours of carving, etc etc) - no one could fail to be amazed.  As long as you have a vague interest in classical music then this is fascinating and  my unmusical husband watched in awe. It is also an eye opener for any child with vague professional music aspirations - the dedication and skill that is required to reach the very top.  Half these competitors prepared over 3 hours of incredibly challenging repertoire over 2-3 years and then only played 3 of their pieces in first round before being knocked out.  Plenty come back for another go the next time round as well of course.  The winner had been there three years before as well before she won this time.  Perfect gift for anyone who plays the harp or likes music or appreciates hard work and craftsmanship.  My daughter the harpist has watched it three times in the first week and definitely upped her practice as a result.",1281916800,9,1476,4.599236641221374
