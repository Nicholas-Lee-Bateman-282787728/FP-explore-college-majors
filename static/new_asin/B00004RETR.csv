It has ninja, yakuza, monsters, silly costumes, goofy humor, and a little over the top violence, which I do so love. I was grinning from ear to ear for most of the film, just when I thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous, it does. There's rarely a dull moment and I didn't mind that it only makes a loose sort of sense. It's without a doubt my favorite bargain hunting purchase of the year.",1437955200,,560,4.554455445544554
7991049,1,B00004RETR,"man i wished someone else had written a review on this, i didn't even finish watching the movie it sucked so bad. One dude who thinks he is some super hero runs around as a protector for the daughter of a rich guy. when she gets in trouble he appears with two other persons.  The dialog is cheesy the plot makes no sense and the fight sceens look like they were done by 5 year olds.  Please don't waste your money.",1190678400,,414,4.098765432098766
7991050,1,B00004RETR,This movie is a load of crap. It was more like a cheap @$$ independant movie with no results. That's all I got to say.,1130284800,,118,3.76
7991051,1,B00004RETR,I bought this thinking I could trust the reviews!  I was wrong this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I love martials arts films I have all the jet's and bruce's I could find.  This is just horrible.  The action and lack of was worse than A kindergarden play with adults.  It is set in modern times even though the cover as ancient times and there are nude scenes but they aren't even good.  Its a real rip off!!! Do not get this movie unless you just have money to waste!!!!!!,1126051200,,489,4.094736842105263
7991052,4,B00004RETR,The make up for this action pack film is excellent. The make up makes up for the bad action. Its not half bad and its not half good.,961545600,,132,3.75
