3841920,3,B0023S4A2G,"Okay before you look at this anime's title and roll your eyes with ""been there, done that"" theatrics, allow me to immediately put your mind at ease: This is not simply an animated version of the classic Shakespeare play.  Instead what we have is a uniquely animated drama based loosely on the classic source material from anime masters, Gonzo.

Released for the first time ever on DVD, Romeo x Juliet from Funimation breaks the 24 total episodes into a pair of two-disc sets.  The first of which (reviewed here) is known as The Romeo Collection and contains episodes 1-12.  Packaged within an appropriately artistically decorated cardboard exterior slipcase is a pair of thin disc cases each containing a single dvd (with 6 episodes on each).

Total runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears a conservative TV PG (13+) rating, based presumably more on the grander adult oriented themes (we do all know how this tale will end) than it is language, sexual scenarios, or gore.

Language options are standard fair sub & dub meaning the original Japanese dialog track is presented (in stereo) as well as the option of instead watching an English dub (in Dolby Surround 5.1).  Finally English subtitles are available with either vocal option.

To paraphrase the opening set-up:  The story takes place once upon a time, in the sky continent known as New Verona where the all-powerful ability to hover in the distant sky breathes life and prosperity upon the people. However, foolish passions will someday transcend eternity. Now let me introduce to you the tragic story of innocent pure love tormented by fate in the midst of chaos, Romeo and Juliet.

In the event that this doesn't help you understand the story better, imagine a blend of European 1600s culture with some mythological elements peppered about for greater intrigue.  The main source of transportation on New Verona happens to be winged horses and let us not forget that this continent is in fact floating high in the sky.

Just like with the play, Gonzo structured the classic Montague versus Capulet struggle as the immediate and driving force of the prose.  However the show does take some interesting liberties fairly early on in the form of young Juliet donning a wig and mask to pose as a male superhero who delivers justice in a severely corrupted and hierarchal society.

The star-crossed lover angle between the lead characters takes little time in starting but develops quite slowly; oftentimes painfully so.  There is little doubt that this show could have succeeded as a 12 or more-standard 13-episode show but was pushed to 24 due to Japanese broadcast television specifics.  As such, expect some story threads to fizzle out and others to drag on needlessly.

In the spans where things are progressing smoothly, the lead characters and their motivations are quite well done (save perhaps for the few times a wig can completely baffle everyone to the fact that Juliet is a female; especially when Romeo and his winged horse encounter the ""male"" version).
Visuals are definitely high budget Gonzo territory and this fact is clear nearly immediately.  The character cells maintain a sort of washed out appearance that adds to the feel of antiquity to the equation while the backgrounds are lavish and rich with impressive lighting effects throughout.

Sound work is solid with a dub that succeeds on some levels but fails at others.  A very deliberate approach was taken early on by the voice talents to eliminate the old-English speaking style of the original work but then often (and out of nowhere) a character will slip into a bit of clich&eacute; old style of speaking only to nearly as quickly recover.  The Japanese audio avoids these pitfalls entirely but comes off as lackluster in some of the key critical moments.  Choose your poison, as it were.

Music score is very appropriate with nice fluctuations at the tense moments and subtle inflections when things get delicate.  In all I came into the show with hopes of Gonzo having duplicated the effort that made Gankutsuou work compared to Alexander Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.  Unfortunately, it appears as though the problem with Romeo x Juliet is that the source material on which it is based was simply too ambitious from the onset.  In effort to make a modernized tale of the Shakespeare play feasible, blown tender moments and miscued romantic scenarios were perhaps inevitable.  Still, you have to give Gonzo credit for even attempting such a feat.  In the end it comes off more as a minor derailment than a total train wreck.  However, suburb visuals, smooth music work, and deliberate pacing may make this one worth looking into regardless of how it compares to the source material.",1246665600,9,4730,4.929382093316519
3841921,4,B0023S4A2G,"I just picked up this anime from a local store and all I can say is...WOW! Therefore read on, dear friends, for thou art about to uncover a gem in thee world of anime...so says I...

I am a fan of this story from the start so my interest in this was already high. So one would think this was a match made in heaven, right? I mean what is there to think about as I enjoy anime and one of my favorite stories has made its way to the States in English. However, I have also learned that just because something is done in the way of anime, a good story one does not make. With that here are my thoughts about this first part of the anime entitled... ""Romeo X Juliet"".

In a nut shell, I am very happy to have seen this anime with my own eyes. I enjoyed the art, the story telling, the way it leads you on and I found myself catching my breath a time or two because I did not see said event happening the way it did (which is VERY rare for me being 38 years young and seeing allot of not only anime but movies in general).

I found myself wanting to jump into some of the fights that happened and other times feeling like I was hiding behind a bush watching and taking in all that was happening with a smile on my face saying to myself...""They are SO made for one another."". But then again, I am a sucker for this story and while my view is tainted, I have to request that if you even remotely enjoy the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"", to please check this out (I feel you will not walk away disappointed...at all).

Are there things that I would have liked to see done in a manner more to my liking? Maybe, but then again, I would not have been left breathless by some of the events that happened and that is well worth its weight in gold in its own self.

I am going to give this only four stars just because I have yet to watch the second part of this (which comes out in Aug if I remember right). But as for what I have seen so far, 5 stars all the way. For the normal anime watcher it may drop a star or two but anything less then 3 out of 5 stars and I feel you are not doing this anime justice.

Romeo X Juliet is a great treat and I for one am more than happy with my purchase and can not say enough good things about this great story done in the form of anime. Now IF only someone would do a anime version of ""The Three Musketeers"" and done as well as this was I would be in anime heaven.",1245283200,6,2389,3.915463917525773
3841922,5,B0023S4A2G,If your like romeo and juliet this is the anime for you and the box set doesn't disappoint. Being part one of two. I bought both at the same time as they were cheaper then paying for the complete series. The box set is put well together for a small 2 disc box set and even comes with some bonus content on the second disc. If you want to see what its like I have added pictures so you get a full in depth view on the product. I like it and was well worth the $7.00 I payed for it. Yeah it was nice and cheap but if anyone knows amazon is like the stock market you need to buy at just the right time.,1294617600,,599,3.761904761904762
3841923,5,B0023S4A2G,"This is only the first part. So keep in mind my review is over the series. This show takes a very sci-fi view of the story by Shakespeare. This does him no honor but no shame. The show is very compelling and drags you in. You are torn between the characters and their agendas and yours. Even I...keep in mind I am a boy... wondered what would happen if things would have gone the way the two characters had originally wanted. One of the problems with this though is there are way too many ironic situations. They obviously weren't enough to hinder my rating but sometimes people need to step out of the box. I understand that many would argue with me that Romeo and Juliet means death...but for once I wish it wouldn't. Even the looses of adaptations manages to keep that part. None the less this is a very compelling anime that if you have just the slightest interest in Romeo and Juliet then this will be fun and a relaxing time for you to enjoy. Your introduced to a vast and beautiful interpretation a play. Dragonsteeds, politics gone bad, and two lovers confused at how everything happened. Oh yeah...This is an amusing roller coaster ride for everyone.",1282953600,,1159,4.523809523809524
3841924,5,B0023S4A2G,"Romeo X Juliet...just finished few minutes ago and was so great anime. The anime has excellent plot that follow the sequent of the main story. The music is perfect well the compositor is the same of ff12.  I do not considered this anime has episodes ""filler""(every episode show you more about the story and the characters). Not every story had perfect ending but this one is great one!. I recommend this anime to everyone!!! :) I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTT!!! LOVE YOU ROMEO & JULIET. Thank you Fumitoshi Oizaki(director of anime)

You Should be Watching it.

Love is something you never regret. Learn about this story...",1282262400,,614,4.884615384615385
3841925,5,B0023S4A2G,"I've always been a fan of the classic play of the same name, so I was excited that an anime adaption was in the works. But I never expected anything like this... I've been enjoying anime for many years, and I don't think any other series I've watched has moved and warmed my heart more than ""Romeo x Juliet.""

William Shakespear's classic tale of these two star crossed lovers is taken to a whole new level of excitement, action, suspence, and romance--all housed within a two volume DVD set. Romeo is a young noblemen and the son of the ruthless Prince Montegue who has brought the helpless and innocent people of Neo Verona to their knees. Juliet is the last surviving member of the slain Capulat family and Neo Verona's only hope for a brighter future. Although they are supposed to despise one another, these two young people simply cannot deny the strong love that they instantly share for each other upon their first meeting. But as they fight to keep their love alive against all odds, will they also be able to end the reign of the vicious tirant Prince Montegue?

This adaption is very loosly based on the play, so not everything is entirely by-the-book. But in the end, the moral of the story is still the same: that the power of true love is strong enough to overcome all obsticals, no matter what.

What more can I say, other than this is an amazing buy! But words really don't do this anime justice--You have to WATCH it. I highly reccomend this product. It may be a little pricey, but you will not regret it!",1258329600,2,1522,4.487364620938628
3841926,5,B0023S4A2G,"Added new depth to the classic William Shakespeare tail Romeo and Juliet.

I had a few doubt going into this series, but my misgivings were quickly put to rest, I thought it might turn out like the Leonardo DiCaprio movie Romeo and Juliet, the movie was pretty bad. Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better.

Romeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZO added much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horse, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit.

The characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more.

Next is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop.

Finally the animation is done by GONZO. The did a stunning job with Romeo X Juliet, it just amazes me how good a job they do.

Overall Romeo and Juliet is a classic anime series, and is in my top 5 anime series I've seen",1257724800,,1436,4.546511627906977
3841927,5,B0023S4A2G,"A wonderful and light hearted ""re-write"" of Romeo and Juliet; the famous tragedy written early in the career of playwright William Shakespeare about two young ""star-cross'd lovers"".

In this modified version of the tale, the entire house of Capulet is murdered by the house of Montague while Juliet is yet a young child.  Juliet, the only survivor of the house of Capulet, is raised in secret by the still-loyal followers of Capulet.  On her 16th birthday, Juliet is appraised of ""who"" she really is - and assumes the burden of raising the standard of Capulet once again.  Unfortunately, this happens after she has already met and fallen in love with Romeo, the crown prince of the house of Montague!

Romeo, Juliet, and their love, initially sweet and innocent, grow more deep mature, and their love more desperate, as both Juliet and Romeo experience the rigors and challenges of life and love in the streets of fair Verona.

The animation is good.  The plot is intricate.  The character development of Romeo and Juliet is captivating.  I highly recommend it!",1251072000,6,1061,4.915730337078652
3841928,5,B0023S4A2G,"I have always loved this story in school. I love always to find a new version to watch.

This is by far my favorite take on the classic. It gives the story a little more depth while placing it into a magical land with flying horses.

It has action, romance, drama and mystery. I have laughed, cried, booed (the evil characters...they are so wonderfully evil)and squeaked with suspense.

WOW! I'm hooked! Even knowing how the story ends I can't help but sit on the edge of my seat with excitement.

I have only had this first part of the collection for two days and have watched it four times!",1249171200,,592,4.4036697247706424
3841929,2,B0023S4A2G,"The captivation of RomeoxJuliet can best be described by General Motor's stock from 2007 until 2009...high value which slowly dwindled down into complete bankruptcy - in this case I lost my investment of time and sanity.

First let me give the series credit where credit is due: the animation and music were done really well and did indeed match the mood throughout the series. There was character development however there were several roles which were filled with busybodies that did not add to the story and never had their background explained.

The secondary shortfall of this series was the plot as the series progressed - it was like a locomotive that slowly ran out of steam. The first half of the series kept me interested and I liked how they set the story in a fantasy type setting. However, long drawn-out events started to occur in the series that were not very interesting and stalled the plot. Additionally I can think of at least 2 episodes which i would classify as ""filler""...which should never happen in a series with less than 36 episodes.

I would have to classify the ending as one of the most disappointing endings I have seen in an anime. The main conflict (villain in this case) was resolved in a terrible way which left the viewer feeling robbed of the impending fight which the series had built up. I know Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy...and I expected that type of ending...but in this case it was like the writer was on vicodin when he planned the finale. Bizarre events started to occur and some characters did not behave normally. The only analogy I can give is if a painting had been started by Da Vinci and then at the end, Picasso decided to finish it off...it just did not work.

I would not recommend this series...although it is deceiving in the beginning and has promise, it is extremely disappointing at the end. There are numerous other romantic/action/fantasy animes which have far superior endings then this one did.

3841930,5,B0023S4A2G,"Alright, so some of you may be thinking: Romeo and Juliet...again? With so many spin offs of this epic classic I am sure most of you thought the same thing I did when I went to watch this Anime for the first time: lame. However, this is not your ordinary Romeo and Juliet tale.

All I can say, is Gonzo is brilliant. This story line is not only quite original (even for being loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy) it is stunning to look at. The animation quality is second to none and all of the characters are easy to fall in love with. There are a few allusions to Shakespeare's other works in this tale and conveys more plot development than just two teens being in an impossible love.

If you love Shakespeare, anime, action, romance, death, and mild violence I really recommend this series for you and the one you love!",1247270400,,826,4.427631578947368
3841931,5,B0023S4A2G,"About two years ago, I have had the opportunity to see Romeo X Juliet as it was announced from Japan through all the major anime media networks.  After seeing the Subbed verions I felt very attached to the amazing artwork, breathtaking musical scores, and the various components of the story (though much of it was hard to connect with the original play-writes and/or historical base (for those who don't know Romeo and Juliet was supposedly a story that William Shakespear was inspired to write based on something that happened in his lifetime.)  I can't say that I'm an expert, but I did get a sense that this animation was trying to add the two elements together creating an alternative perspective for the story.  (After all, that's the only conclusion one must take when seeing that William Shakespear himself is cast as a character in the story.)
  As with stories that GONZO has presented before like ""Gankutsuou: Count of Monte Cristo"" and ""Le Chevalier D'eon"" there were obvious real elements while at the same time creative and alternative elements that brought a whole new world within the original concept.
  The first time I watched Romeo X Juliet it was in SUB, but now that I've seen it in its full glory (English version) it has certainly made me come to see even more reason why this version of the classic tale is not only addictive, but better than its original.  For many die-hard fans, it's not the first time the story was manipulated either in ending or various other elements changed.
  Granted this is only the first volume, but I'm tortuously waiting for the release of the second half.
  The original play left aspects of immaturity and rather adult-like themes that felt like Romeo was a womanizer and Juliet was a weak-minded girl who gave into temptation.  The nicer presentation of the anime makes Romeo and Juliet older (16 or 17) which is a much more acceptable dating age in today's standards.  Plus, Romeo is given a much more responsible and respectable characteristic, while Juliet is given a more daring and heroic persona.
  If this anime wasn't presented in segregated episodes, but in theatrical length film, I feel that this animation would astound theater audiences and debatingly ride up there with some of the best animated features of all times.  (Though that'd be hard to prove.)
  I hope that GONZO keeps producing classic stories into animes and continue to create the stunning visual effects and musical scores.
