3597815,2,B001G7Q2XK,I watch only one episode and will not watch again.  This is not a family that should be on tv. The mother is not loving or even projects kindness and caring!,1394582400,,157,4.064516129032258

3597827,5,B001G7Q2XK,"The DVD sets could be a tad bit better.  Season 5, the saddest and most controversial season due to the nasty divorce of Jon and Kate, is cut too short to be worth the money for it.  Netflix has the whole series including season 5 with BONUS episodes.  The DVD does not.  The final episode on the DVD is FAQ with Kate (and only Kate), when there was so much more captured on tape during that train wreck of a time.  Season 3 is my favorite season, however it's missing the episode where the Gosselins head (by way of the big bus) to Disney World.  To this day, I have NEVER seen that episode.  That's my criticism for the purchase of the DVD's, though worth it only on Amazon where the DVD's are super cheap.

As for the show~I can say that I have driven my poor husband nuts with this melodramatic and zany reality show, and I'm not even a fan of the typical reality show genre.  However, my husband rolls his eyes and sighs a frustrated sigh every time he hears the obnoxious opening (""ON THIS EPISODE OF JON AND KATE PLUS EIGHT!"").  I think that the only way that I'll ever stop watching this show is if my husband threatens to leave me.  Reruns and all, I can't stop watching.

BUT!  The main reason I can't stop watching is because I'm addicted to the drama and as previously mentioned, the train wreck of it all.  I am such a self-professed hypocrite because it drives me crazy that the kids are exploited right down to toilet scenes (I usually fast forward through those, to my credit).  They have NO PRIVACY!  Every tantrum, every tear, every flu epidemic is caught on tape.  And narcissistic  Kate, as well as overly passive Jon will proudly proclaim that there are no boundaries in this show.

I admire how organized Kate is.  She definitely knows how to run a tight ship as far as making lists and schedules, as well as a spic and span house, and home-cooked meals as opposed to takeout which is what I would be tempted to do if I had that many kids to feed. However as much as Kate likes to brag that her kids only eat organic and healthy foods, Eggo waffles, Pop Tarts, and M&M's are not organic. I'm not faulting her for BUYING non-organic, but it makes me laugh every time she brags about their organic diet, which she does in MANY episodes.  Oh well.  The kids eat healthy enough and it is better than takeout for sure.

DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW UNLESS YOU LIKE MELODRAMA, NARCISSISM, AND OCD MOMS!  YOU WILL HATE THIS SHOW!  I like it because as sick as it is, it is comical at times to watch Kate meltdown in a Crayola Factory over her kids wanting to experiment with the WASHABLE magic markers, and then simply refuse to let them do so at all.  It's compelling and disturbing to watch her get upset at one of her kids for vomiting on a comforter (again, washable, Kate) during a severe flu bout.  It's infuriating and exasperating to listen to her lament in the same episode (""Cooking With the Twins"" ~ Season 3) that she spends soooo much time (WAHHH!) doing laundry as it is without having to deal with Joel ""choosing"" to vomit on his comforter.  In almost the same breath however, she says that all she has to do is wash and dry because her friends do the folding and putting away, as well as ironing.  Then she says, ""That's probably why I don't mind doing laundry.""  And to solve the vomiting dilemma, she sticks her kid on the linoleum laundry room floor for easy cleanup, never-mind that the kid is already racked with high fever and flu symptoms...let's stick him on the cold, hard floor for Kate's own convenience!  I understand that she has sextuplets and twins, and that I would go insane often enough, under the same circumstances, but jeez, I wouldn't make it worse through Joan Crawford-like traits, I would hope.  You'll see (if you bother to watch) in the same season, beloved Aunt Jodi comforting the same child during a relapse of the flu, while not just babysitting the eight Gosselin kids, but her own four at the same time, most of them dealing with the flu, so while it must be hard to keep your cool and maintain motherly comforting, it's not impossible, as the episode (""Jon's Hair Raising Experience"") will show.

You'll also see that Jon has his flaws as well (childishness, passiveness, and alleged poor decisions in season 5...etc...etc), and yes, the kids aren't perfect, but Kate is the alpha female that makes the show tragic and compelling at the same time.  I've already written a blow-hard review and for those that have bothered to read it in full, I have given away too much, but there is so much more!  So if you're ever bored and think your life is bad and you like this sort of fluff, sit back and enjoy.  Be warned:  It is addicting.",1326844800,4,4690,4.430571761960326
3597828,4,B001G7Q2XK,"I bought this for my girlfriend right before news came out that they were splitting up.  I thought she would decide she didn't want it, but she still loves to watch the show before all of the drama started up.  The kids are cute and the parents are still tolerable at this point in the show/their lives.  This season is still good for anyone who liked the show before everything fell apart.  Its all about the kids anyway right??",1285459200,,429,4.3924050632911396
3597829,5,B001G7Q2XK,"My kids love Jon & Kate and even with all the stuff going on in the media, they are still big fans. They love watching all the episodes. This is a great buy.",1274486400,,157,3.787878787878788
3597830,5,B001G7Q2XK,"My Grandaughter loves to watch the show. I bought this video for her, She can watch them any time now. She loves it!!",1252368000,,117,4.130434782608695
3597831,5,B001G7Q2XK,My daughter watches these episodes over and over again.  Can't get enough of the Goesselin clan! Worth the purchase!,1246579200,2,116,5.105263157894737
3597832,4,B001G7Q2XK,"What can I say, I am hoooooked on this show.  The kids are adorable, Jon and Kate are both long suffering, and I can relate to the Korean background of Jon, as we are currently in the process of adopting from Korea.  I think they are both loving parents, but I have to agree with other folks' assessment of Kate's nasty, whiny, woe-is-me attitude.  Especially troubling due to the rumors of affairs and possible divorce, and my heart breaks for these kids.  Seems fame and fortune ruined these folks, as is common in Hollywood stars.  Too much pressure from stardom, too much temptation, and too much fighting between the couple.  The kids will suffer cuz of this behavior from famous mom and dad.  That being said, this show has become an almost guilty pleasure of mine.  I just love the kids, and initially was impressed by the apparent strenght of the parents commitment to each other and their kids.  I don't think it was a sham-I think they just fell apart and became selfish due to fame.  It still amazes me that they managed to care for eight kids, a daunting task for sure, and it was refreshing to see them as real people.  It breaks my heart that due to Kate's endless insults of jon, adultery, and other things, an ideal family will now be destroyed.  No more Jon and Kate for us, but it is probably better for the poor kids who are now a marketed commodity.  this show started as a few episodes and many of were hooked by the time we realized how exploitive this was getting.  Many folks turned to these shows cuz they wanted a change from sleaze and filth, and ironically, sleaze and filth now follow the Gosselings.",1242604800,,1629,4.477966101694915
3597833,5,B001G7Q2XK,"I now own all 3 available seasons of the Jon and Kate Plus Ei8ht series.  I love them all.  As usual, Kate is her nasty self.  Some of the antics the kids pull are unbelievable but funny.  I watch young children and so have to just laugh when I watch these guys - especially the younger 6.",1242086400,,289,4.017543859649122
3597834,5,B001G7Q2XK,"This was a gift for my wife. It was priced right and shipped in a speedy manner. She hasn't watched them yet, and may not, now that Jon has been having an afair, but I also got the book, and she is reading and enjoying that.",1241740800,,224,3.891304347826087
3597835,5,B001G7Q2XK,"I love this family. They are real people.
  Fun to watch their adventures!",1240272000,,74,4.615384615384615
3597836,5,B001G7Q2XK,"As I was channel-surfing one day, I happened upon a channel that had several little kids all sitting around a table being fed by the Mommy.  I was curious what this was and besides, these kids were so cute, I just had to check it out.  Come to find out, this would become one of my favorite programs on 'TLC'.  ""Jon and Kate Plus 8"" is a straight-forward, stress-relieving, entertaining show, with six of the cutest kids on TV, and with a pair of older twin sisters that are having their own growing pains. I am hoping this show will continue for years to come. If you love little kids, you will like this video.",1239062400,2,612,4.304347826086956
3597837,3,B001G7Q2XK,"There's nothing wrong with the quality of these DVDs, they feature the same episodes we know and love, however, there are some things that could have been improved. Firstly, there is no ""play all"" option, which would have been a nice feature. Also, when watching on a computer you can't skip and reverse by clicking on the progress bar, you actually have to fast forward and rewind using the extremely slow arrows. This makes finding specific scenes or moments in the episode more difficult than it needs to be. I've tried doing this in several programs and on more than one computer, but I apologize if this is something that works for others.

Especially troubling is the fact that regularly aired episodes are listed as 'Special Features'. These are listed on the box as ""Behind the Scenes"" and ""Viewer Faq"", which makes one think these are things we haven't seen before. If it's an episode that is played regularly, it's not a Special Feature. The music video featured on the DVD was also shown on TV. This wouldn't have deterred me from purchasing these DVDs, but I find the misadvertising annoying.

If you love this show, these DVDs are still great!",1237334400,6,1156,4.746268656716418
3597838,5,B001G7Q2XK,I love this show.  I have watched it every Monday. I Bought this one instead of season one and two just cause it has more episodes. I will get them sooner or later.  I am looking forward to the rest of the seasons coming out.,1236384000,,225,3.977777777777778
3597839,3,B001G7Q2XK,"After waiting a month for the item I was sent only the second half of the season, then after another month of waiting I was told that Amazon couldn't send the full season.
The second half is good, but if you want to see the whole thing I suggest you buy it elsewhere!",1235606400,,267,4.056603773584905
3597840,3,B001G7Q2XK,"Very much enjoy the series and my children enjoy watching while we are on long drives in the car,  my only criticism would be that the DVD does not have a feature that simply allows you to play all episodes on each disc,  once an episode has ended,  you have to use your remote control to scroll to the next episode,  I was disappointed with that.  I bought Seasons 1 & 2 and you can play all episodes.  I wish the family well and enjoy this show very much.",1234224000,4,457,4.078651685393258
3597841,4,B001G7Q2XK,"I'm assuming people looking at this already know whether or not they like the show, if you don't know or haven't seen it yet it's not hard to catch the episodes playing almost round the clock in syndication on TLC. The third season is still the lovable Gosselin family, the episodes are the finest of the series so far as it showed us the families real daily lives around the home more than recent episodes but the children were older and more mature than earlier seasons. This set also has the especially enjoyable episodes that focused on individual time between Jon & Kate with each individual child on their own special day. Episodes included in this 4 disc set are:

Trip To The Zoo
Day In The Life
Twins Turn 7!
Kate Hires A Nanny

Plus Special Features: Behind the Scenes of Jon & Kate Plus 8 (which originally aired as an episode).
Viewer FAQ (Which originally aired as an episode)
Music Video: A Hug & A Kiss (Which was promoted and aired once on television)

All episodes this season are shot and shown in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen Aspect Ratio. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0. There Are English Subtitles,  the set is rated G and has a running time of approx. 698 minutes.

This season is in my opinion the best Jon & Kate has to offer. I haven't enjoyed recent episodes as much as these ones, possibly because they've been away from home alot doing too many out of the ordinary things that I can't relate to when I always found that sense of home to be the heart of the series. Hopefully now that they've settled into their new house the show will return more to the format I enjoyed. Though the hype the show has received and the affect it seems to have had (in my opinion) on the family will never allow it to be as great as it was in this third season it is still and probably will always be an enjoyable family series for most and they're who I recommend this to.",1234224000,19,2391,4.538283062645012

Also when I insert the disk in the DVD player when the menu screen comes up it is just a blue screen with play...half the time I have to keep ejecting the disk to get it to play.
