The British films have their flavor with mysteries but the French have the Gallic way of infusing humor in the most unlikely manner that the mysteries become terrific platforms of French humor at its finest. Film Movement is re-releasing this 1972 gem of a film and it hasn't lost a bit of its allure. Written by Francis Veber and writer/director Yves Robert this little pastiche is a treasure.

Two factions of the French Secret Service (Jean Rochefort and Bernard Blier) involve a seemingly normal but hapless orchestra player, Franois Pignon (Pierre Richard), into their battle as one side uses him as a decoy by being identified as a super secret agent.. Soon, agents are all over the place, and one of them, Christine (Mireille Darc), is sent to seduce Franois. Meanwhile, Franois has his own problems, tangled up in an affair with his best friend's wife.

This is French comedy/mystery at its best and it is just as radiant today as it was in 1972! Grady Harp, July 15",1435795200,,1071,4.656084656084656

7132888,4,B00WKVL4TI,"I liked it because of its basically nonsensical story--but not that much. Maybe it gelled in 1972, but 45 years later, this line of humor leaves something to be desired. Are we turning too cynical? 3 1/2 stars",1485820800,,209,4.526315789473684
7132889,4,B00WKVL4TI,"I recommend this movie! While on the one hand it is obviously very dated, it is also very contemporaneous to anyone who values private liberty!",1485734400,,143,4.76

7132892,5,B00WKVL4TI,As enjoyable and laugh out loud funny now as it was when it first came out. Absolutely worth another watch.,1484006400,,107,4.4
7132893,5,B00WKVL4TI,Just great.  A classic French romance.  Fun. Charming.,1483920000,,54,5.625

7132898,5,B00WKVL4TI,So glad to get this with subtitles. One of the funniest movies ever.,1480636800,,68,4.3076923076923075

7132900,5,B00WKVL4TI,"A great flick, and so much better than the disgusting American remake.  It's really brilliantly plotted, and there's some great physical comedy.  I had to watch Maurice take a header over the front wheel of his bicycle (when he hears his wife in bed with a horse in the van he's following...makes perfect sense if you've seen the movie) five or six times, and I could do it again right now.  Matter of fact, I think I will.",1475798400,,423,4.397435897435898
7132901,4,B00WKVL4TI,"Very funny with characters and situations that are set up well; as well as a gorgeous actress. I thought I saw this in the early 80's (?) at the Naro in Norfolk, but it must have been ""The Return of the Tall Blond Man..."".",1475107200,,222,4.068181818181818
7132902,5,B00WKVL4TI,"Hilarious,  We have been looking for this for 10 Years.  This is the French version with subtitles which is funnier the the American made movie",1471910400,,143,4.68
7132903,5,B00WKVL4TI,A very funny movie in French w/subtitles that I've seen several times over the years. Much better than the remake with Tom Hanks in English.,1469318400,,140,4.64
7132904,5,B00WKVL4TI,Fantastic in every respect! Timeless!,1463616000,,37,6.6
7132905,5,B00WKVL4TI,"Here's the original French theatrical film -- with excellent English subtitles, great audio-video quality and everything -- and packed with boundless wit and hilarity!  Exhibiting brilliant parodying of James Bond, and North by Northwest, and even plot and antics in common with The Court Jester, this gut-buster soars in many comedic modes.  For instance, I think even Mozart wouldve guffawed at the uproarious happenings with a performance of his 40th Symphony -- which is conducted with exaggerated repose and dignity by the films own gifted director, Yves Robert -- all in the face of a whole bunch of calamities.  I was also glad to see the illustrated essay that comes with the DVD, which makes many informative and insightful observations about the film.  Except the essayist made (only) a few mistakes.  First, the program notes mix up two characters (Toulouse and Milan) in one part.  Second, Christine, the spy, is a divorcee rather than a widow; and below is what really happens in the film, with spy-boss Bernard Milans eavesdropping scheme becoming a farcical disaster for him and his entourage:
Our hapless hero, Francois Perrin, visits the plush apartment of a comely young divorceein fact a secret agent, Christine. She is sent by Milan, who has furiously declared, The party is over now! and Christine is to extract information from Perrin by seduction. This ploy brings bumbling ecstasies for Perrin, while Milan and his spies can only yearn and suffer in surveillance.  In fact, the whole apartment sequence is so zany that Ive no doubt actress Mireille Darc's (Christine's) laughter is spontaneous when bursting out at Pierre Richards grand goofiness and plastic-faced expressions.  The sultry vamp just cant contain herself, even as she tries to be so serious and focused, while stripping in stages to full nudity, and then bedding down our overcome hero.  And all to the pulse-racing frustration of the aroused Milan and his voyeuristic gang.  And theres oh so much more.  Just get the DVD and youll surely want to watch it repeatedly!",1462060800,5,2057,5.092261904761905

7132907,5,B00WKVL4TI,Good movie.  The scene where he plays his violin concerto for the girl is the best.,1455235200,,83,4.1875

7132912,5,B00WKVL4TI,Great,1447459200,,5,5.0
7132913,5,B00WKVL4TI,"This wonderfully funny movie hasn't aged in the last 30 years. If anything, it is more relevant now (with our enhanced ability to invade people's privacy) than it was when it was first released. Don't worry if you don't know French: the subtitles are perfectly adequate. My only complaint is that it seems so short, probably because today's movies are so bloated.",1443744000,,363,4.870967741935484
7132914,5,B00WKVL4TI,Very funny.  Much better than the later American remake The Man with One Red Shoe starring Tom Hanks.  Enjoy!,1437782400,,109,4.684210526315789
7132915,5,B00WKVL4TI,"This is a very famous classic of French comedy which was remade as the so-so Tom Hanks film ""The Man With One Red Shoe"".  The difference is in the comic actor, Pierre Richard, who outbumbled Peter Sellers in the loose limbed slapstick department.  The last comic scene of hit men arriving at the same destination as their target at the same time is hysterically funny.",1437523200,,368,4.6461538461538465
7132916,5,B00WKVL4TI,"This is a review of the DVD version - not the Bluray:
Honestly, its been well over 40 years since I saw this 1972 offbeat French comedy but I remembered how much I liked it then and I loved it just as much this time around. This was the period when everyone was making spy films and satires on them. The plot is inane  its not a spoiler to tell you this much. A drug dealer is trying to get his competitors (or is it the police  I don't know and it doesnt matter) off his trail. So he tells them he will be the 9:30 plane at the airport. He then has one of his henchmen pick an average guy getting off the plane and pretend that HE is the smuggler. He picks out the mild violinist and from then on everyone chase him. (He has no clue!), the real centerpiece of the 90-minute film is the seduction scene with GORGEOUS and SEXY Mirelle Darc. That alone is worth the price of admission.

I saw a bunch of reviews of this film here on Amazon and all talk about the quality of the print. This is a BEAUTIFUL RESTORED print being issued by Film Movement  as part of a new line of Film Moment Classics. Its great!

The only extras are the trailer  and a few other trailers. But theres also a 12 page booklet with a 5-page essay and a full page color photo of Ms. Darc (in THAT backless dress!).

If you remember the film, youll want to see it again. If you like slapstick comedy (think Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther), I think youll like this one.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
