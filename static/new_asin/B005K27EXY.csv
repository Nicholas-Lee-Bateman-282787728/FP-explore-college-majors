8476458,5,B005K27EXY,Love this series was sorry to see that it had so few seasons. Good characters and plots. I do wis it and other Nordic series were readily available in US versions. But I have a DVD that will play PAL.,1461801600,,200,4.025
8476459,2,B005K27EXY,"Too many Scandinavian series are jumping on the Nordic Noir bandwagon. They seem to be either very good (The Killing, The Bridge & Those Who Kill) or very poor (Arne Dahl). This one is the latter. The strength of the good ones is that the characters and the plots are strong and hold your attention. The poor ones however, like this one, have weak characters and a rambling story that too often has obvious trivial filler scenes. They also tend to have too many main characters resulting in none of them being developed much as the plot jumps from one to another. The only reason I didn't give this one star is that unlike Arne Dahl, I didn't actually fall asleep watching this. Pretty close though. Compare that with The Killing where I watched about five episodes in a row.",1450656000,,775,4.542857142857143
8476460,5,B005K27EXY,"I find this show very interesting. It's not the typical police drama, as this features the Danish version of Secret Service agents, who step in to protect dignitaries, whether they be visiting politicians or the Danish Prime Minister or some other government ministers of the cabinet. The show is well done, and never seems too drawn out or slow. We're filled in on particular conflicts or threats (from the past) to the person requiring protection, and then some problem solving to target potential threats in the immediate vicinity. It is not hard to follow the subtitles for this particular show.",1438300800,,599,5.0
8476461,5,B005K27EXY,I watched this on Netflix. It is my all-time favorite TV series of it's type. The characters are well developed and the stories are so captivating. It was not unusual to be moved between laughter and tears within the episodes. How can we get it in the US format?,1424649600,,262,4.36734693877551
8476462,1,B005K27EXY,"I may try this one as I just finished The Eagle,,which was good. As pointed out by other review..darn ol Wallander has just spoiled us here in the USA ...Swedish versions and Brit version...all have moved ""the Bar"" up so high. We bought an all region..code free DVD player so able to do all Unit One, couple of the Becks. And a few other of the Danish crime shows. I wonder how an American TV person feels after watching some...heck most any of these. For myself I never even turn American commercial TV on. Not at all....with...Borgen, Foyle, Beck, Wern, why would I bother? In fact I wonder if there are a huge bunch of fans say over in Denmark or England who are clambering for our junk? Ya think? I will get this soon.",1405123200,,722,4.355555555555555
8476463,3,B005K27EXY,. . . . compared to other crime/political fiction I have been watching such as The Bridge and Borgen. Trying to decide if it is the writing that is at fault or the acting. Perhaps I will return to the episodes I stopped watching when there isn't anything else to watch.,1398038400,,269,4.294117647058823
8476464,2,B005K27EXY,"The description for this series sounded so good, and is a genre I favor, so I bought Series 1 and Series 2. I didn't care for it at all. I think the Swedish version of Wallander with Krister Henricksson is SO good that it ruined me for anything less.
I returned both series of The Protectors. No point in keeping it.",1395187200,,316,4.19672131147541
8476465,5,B005K27EXY,"after i finished watching THE EAGLE from denmark on netflix streaming, which was also five stars, i moved onto this show there, also from denmark.  i watched it straight throught, just like i did with THE EAGLE. this follows in the wake of my watching other foreign crime tv shows on netflix.  i find them all fascinating, thry add A whole new dimension to crime drama.

this one concerns the danish version of our secret service, although their protectorate is larger, extending to public figures, royalty and beyond. i hate to sound stupid but i did not realize that many of their problems dovetail with our own. first, they are losing soldiers in our wars and this has a spill over effect into crime and protection back home. Second, they have a big islamic fundamentalist crime and terrorism problem which rears its ugly head from time to time.  third, when we show up for some world event, it throws their security into a tailspin, even though we bring our own security. fourth, the CIA is a concern for them as it is well entrenched there. what do you do if you are in danish security and find out that you've been having an affair with a CIA agent?  this show covers that.  of course, they have their own problems too but i never imagined that our interests impacted so strongly on them.

the actors playing the lead characters are all great. both seasons are terrific.  i wish there were more seasons of it.

For this reason, the Danish government has set up the elite Personal  Protection Unit, whose top bodyguards form a tight-knit community of friends who live and work together.""  Livvagterne

I just happened upon this new Danish series, 'The Protectors' on Netflix. And, it is superb, the characters and the storyline fulfill all superlatives. I also found that this series won  'International Emmy Award Best New Series'', and, as it should!

The Protectors is  a nail-biting,  look at the dangers threatening public figures today - and those who protect them.
In the first episode, several young, aspiring policemen and a single woman are taking part in the annual  admission test in Copenhagen to become protectors. Cecillie Stenspil plays a young Egyptian woman, Jasmina El-Murad. She is the only woman inthe midst of many men trying out for a position. She is very resilient, takes the brunt of woman and immigrant spurs, but she proves to be made of firmer stuff.  Soren Vejby plays Rasmus Poulsen, a young Danish policeman who proves his worth very early. Andre Babikian plays Jonas Goldschmidt.  He is a young man, married, has an affair with a journalist, and we wonder if that arrangement will survive. Thomas Gabrielsson plays Leon Jensem, the leader of the Protector group. He is experienced and well versed in all security related things.

The first part of episode one is based on the training of this group, and we see who survives and who fails. The physical and mental tests are excruciating. This job requires strength, mental and physical, and no one with any sign of weakness will survive.

We follow the lives of politicians as they try to perform their daily job and lives. We are privy to the inside stories of these people andto those who are part of the protection squad. This is a fast paced series, excellent storylines and the characters are true to life, some likable, some not as much, but the inter-play of them all gives this series all superlatives!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-31-12
