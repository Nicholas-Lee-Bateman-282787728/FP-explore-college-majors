4104941,3,B003B2UK1S,"By far one of the oddest collection of short films I have ever seen, ""Destricted"" is more of a curiosity than a form of entertainment. As I viewed these experimental films (most of which lack any sort of dialogue or coherent narrative), I began to sense that I had not taken nearly enough film studies courses to appreciate what I was watching. The films range from the simply weird (a montage of a woman--I think--lapping up various viscous substances from a glass table, shot entirely from underneath the table) to the bizarrely erotic (a naked man, with a turnip protruding from his rectum, masturbating against the rotating driveshaft of a tractor). This collection of films contains a great deal of nudity and explicit sex, yet the most interesting film in the bunch is Larry Clark's documentary, which features interviews with a number of mostly ordinary looking young men and haggard-looking porn actresses discussing their sexual experiences. Purportedly a series of auditions for a porn flick, Clark's film culminates with one lucky young man consummating his experience with one of the actresses. This film is interesting in the broadest sense of the word, but certainly not for the modest, the faint of heart, or the easily shocked. Worth seeing, but probably just once.",1308355200,20,1281,5.047169811320755
4104942,5,B003B2UK1S,"The DVD ""Destricted"" presents 8 short films made by 8 different international directors all purportedly focused on issues of sex, pornography, and art. Because of the 'artful' nature of these vignettes their content, which in many cases includes hard-core imagery, tends to be thought provoking rather than arousing. One would assume that this was 'the point' of the exercise, and, as such, I think that the collection of erotica succeeds quite nicely.  The variety of approaches taken by the various film-makers is decidedly interesting.  Several of the pieces utilize rather standard porn footage that is 'manipulated' in some fashion to cause the viewer to analyze the content in a non-standard way.  There is a brief animated film that uses rotoscoped sex scenes that have been hand painted to create a lush impressionistic feel. A surreal Euro film sequence depicts a couple making love where the man's member is a giant crystal that is shattered, then reconstructed in a most unusual fashion, featuring faux scatological imagery that demonstrates the power of film to create disturbing illusions. Dissembodied lips press suggestively against a glass plate full of various colorful viscous liguids creating pictures that are at once erotic and disturbing. The longest segment is a bit of a documentary that focuses on the 'casting' for a short porn film - interviewing potential male and female performers and giving insights into the real people behind the porno product. All in all VERY thought provoking, and potentially a good 'couples film' as it presents erotic and stimulating sexual imagery in an intelligent context.",1308009600,15,1630,5.285714285714286
4104943,1,B003B2UK1S,"I am a Gaspar Noe fan, so bought this collection of short films, for that reason. But, for the most part, this film has nothing to do with art. It is garbage. Dont waste your money.",1299628800,,181,4.055555555555555
4104944,5,B003B2UK1S,"I love this idea, of asking some of the most interesting artists and filmmakers to re-interpret porn.  Takes the whole, Is it art?  Is it porn? debate out of a theoretical argument and creates some really cool, daring, sex films.  More!!",1289865600,4,237,4.7317073170731705
4104945,5,B003B2UK1S,"I saw Destricted at Sundance when it premiered, it was shocking and so fantastic in equal measure. My favourite was Larry Clark's film, which was a funny, sad and an insight into american youth and their idea of sex today.

There is not alot out there like destricted, people will love or hate it but I feel that true independent is all about ideas like this.
There are a few films to choose from on a DVD menu, so you can choose what you watch and in what order, now thats what I call being in control of your viewing pleasure!",1288742400,11,528,4.227722772277228
4104946,5,B003B2UK1S,"Wow! No words can accurately describe this film. Destricted is a collection of short films by a bunch of well known artists (including two of my favorites, Larry Clark and Matthew Barney!) It aims to explore the relationship between art and porn, and spark debate about whether sex and pornography should be considered art. Parts of it are actually shocking and all of it is pretty explicit, but definitely makes you look at porn in a different light.  Worth watching...unlike any film I've ever seen.",1287532800,43,501,4.894117647058824
4104947,5,B003B2UK1S,"I'm confused that all of these reviews for the non-USA version of DESTRICTED are listed under this product, as the US release is a different lineup of films AND is a US DVD that is compatible with all US DVD players.  The US version has a new line up EIGHT (not 7) films and brings exciting new views to the collection.  I saw a screening at the SVA sceener in NY, which was of selected clips, but am super excited to see all 8 on DVD.  It's a shame the other reviews are not even for this DVD, which won't even be released for another 2 weeks!",1287532800,26,544,4.065420560747664

4104951,5,B003B2UK1S,"Saw it during 2006 Sundance in Salt Lake City. Had to pinch myself to see if I was still in Utah.

Here are words I would use to describe the film: Revolutionary! Astounding! Eye opening! Enlightening!

More recently the film was banned by the Salt Lake City Library. They refused to add it. Many other libraries have the title also (ref world cat dot org). They refuse to say why they won't add it.

Modern day Fahrenheit 451, brought to you by the people who majored in marketing and public relations in college, instead of history or even library science. ""If we refuse to speak about why we won't add your donated title, it's not censorship."" I don't think so.

Played at Sundance and Cannes, including at the Salt Lake Film Society's Broadway during Sundance.

Suggest getting yourself a copy today, if for no other reason that to help respond to the fact that the film was just banned by the Salt Lake City Library! Hey, it played here in 2006. But apparently in 2014 people are still afraid of sex.

Buy a copy, and donate a copy to your local library. Sounds like a plan. And if they refuse to add it, complain.

That's my suggestion!",1401408000,,1142,4.48792270531401

4104956,2,B003B2UK1S,I wanted to see for my self what all the mixed reviews were about on Destricted. I really like Gaspar Noe as a director so that was my main reason for purchasing this dvd. I thought it was a bit over the top on some of the videos and uncomfortable to view. I do like shocking stuff but some of it was just tastless. Larry Clarks' was my favorite and Gaspar Noes' had the best film work.,1334880000,5,386,4.025974025974026
4104957,3,B003B2UK1S,"This is the 8 scene dvd.  Manual masturbation with heavy equipment, toys, 70's porn, watersports, scat & more.  Pretty much anything from the brightest sections of the porn filled internet to the darker, harder to find fetishes.  As posted before, this is a collection of what 8 different people say is erotic or what they like porn-wise.
Some is grainy & hard to see.  Others are recent, clean & light filled detail.
Parts of this made me skip ahead while others were enjoyable to watch.  If you are a fan of erotica & wish to partake in the buffet, then this is a wonderful dvd.  If you only want fries with that, then you will be disappointed.",1321920000,24,646,4.478632478632479

8393379,4,B003B2UK1S,"This is an interesting collection of short films on sex because of it's uniqueness and diversity within the contributions. I bought the video because of an interest in Gaspar Noe, but his contribution is not the best piece. Mathew Barney's film is wonderul. The others are interesting too, the Balkan piece . . .

I went to a live interview of Gaspar Noe to see a special viewing of Into the Void. With extreme films, such as Noe's We **** Alone, I believe it is very useful to 'detect' the character of the director to see what their 'mission' is - or are they randomly filling culture with destructive, offensive film? (Fine: some people judge the art object itself, regardless of its origin / artists intention. I am not one of those.) At least so far, all of Noe's films represent nihilism (Seul Contre Tous, Irreversible, Into the Void), pointless and detached views where the essence of life is cruelty, godless, cold. It is useful to be aware of such views, but ultimately, it's facile. Most people don't walk through a constant Hell.

Watch Noe's short film in Destricted, about loveless sex, that goes on and on and on - it's creepy, claustrophobic, insular. It's also, interesting to compare Noe's film to the other directors visions of sex in this anthology. For instance Mathew Barney's film is a very good counterpoint: essentially, the theme is the same, singular sex, but it is manifested totally differently. Where Noe's vision is desperate, lost, can't help using the word . . . nihilistic. Barney's take on the same act is positive; still weird, but not weird in an alienating way.

So, seeing Noe in a live interview? Such a surprise. He's charismatic, cute, funny. Knowing Noe's work in film, he's difficult to fathom in a half hour. How do you link the two? This friendly guy and his stylish, nasty films. I have also seen Michael Haneke interviewed live, in a special screening of Funny Games uncensored. He comes across as much more of a 'full' being. He is caring, honest, responsible and has a philosophical approach to things. You can tell from his words and bearing that he takes film seriously, he has conviction, his work is a fully-considered response to add dialogue to make people think, offering a view which questions Hollywoods more entertainment-centric bias. I know where I am with Haneke. With Gaspar, given his extreme films, I do sort of wonder why he makes them. They don't fully justify themselves, when you consider the same message in all of his film. Yes, life can be pointless, but that isn't the same as saying life is pointless full stop.",1509148800,,2586,4.755011135857461
