8761627,3,B01FW78D90,"It is not the fault of the sellers, as I bought 2 movies to give away as gifts. I guess I do not understand the PAL format, because the DVD played great for my mom, but when she gave it to us to watch, it would not play at all. We tried our blu-ray and regular DVD player, Neither seemed to know what to do with the movie. So I was told it was very good, I have yet to view the movie. I could have ordered it out of a publication/ magazine I receive, but thought going through prime would be the easiest! No fault but mine!",1495584000,,523,3.8518518518518516
