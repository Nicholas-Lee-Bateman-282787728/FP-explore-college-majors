7995811,5,B0000A2ZOC,"I enjoyed this little DVD. Leonard Nimoy narrates it and that make it better, but the events start at the earliest period of man's history and then brings you forward to the next events that formed and shaped our world as it is today.

Great DVD to share with your children and grandchildren. History need to be important to them and this brings those dry facts found in school books alive and makes them live again.

A very delightful find, I have always been interested in world history but this was exceptionally good.",1188518400,2,521,4.591397849462366
