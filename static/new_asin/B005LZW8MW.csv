8478846,5,B005LZW8MW,"It was so interesting to see the diversity of the cuisines highlighted in this dvd.  Multiculturalism at its best, just as it is here in Australia.  I learned so much from watching this dvd.",1370476800,2,190,4.5588235294117645
8478847,4,B005LZW8MW,"It is a great DVD about different cultures and famiy food traditions in America.
However, it is not what i expected when I ordered it. I wanted to have a DVD with Lidia's new recipes and see her cooking the dishes. Instead they show most of the food of different cultures: Mexican, Chinese and Jewish and tell you how to make may be a couple of them (not in details), but it is not a DVD on cooking dishes, like Lidia's other DVDs...It is more about family traditions and cultures than on actual recipes and cooking...It is not what I expected to see since i wanted to learn new recipes from Lidia.",1358899200,5,598,4.348214285714286
