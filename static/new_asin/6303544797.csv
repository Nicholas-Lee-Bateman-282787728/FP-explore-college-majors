7850565,3,6303544797,"Honeymoon is the first episode, where they ""must somehow form a family"" -- Mike and ... get married.
A Camping We Will Go is a classic from early in the series where they are still trying to form a family.
HOWEVER, having watched these episodes when they first ran, this video seems to have trimmed scenes out of both episodes!  Especially in the camping video, there seems to be NO support for the girls projecting the bear onto the boys tent.  In the original I saw, the boys did something to provoke it.  NOT IN THIS VIDEO.  So dissapointed.  I've noticed the same thing (cut scenes) in the Gilligan's Island videos from AOL/TimeWarner.
Anyone else notice this?  Am I dreaming?",1011657600,6,680,4.625
7850566,5,6303544797,"This video collection contains two episodes ""The Honeymoon"" and ""A Camping We Will Go"".  For all of you classic TV buffs, you'll be interested to know that the first episode in this collection is the  pilot for the series, and explains how Mike and Carol got married.  In the  second episode, Mike offers to bring the girls on an annual camping trip  with Greg, Peter, and Bobby, much to their dismay.  You can be sure that  some interesting things will happen.  Almost reminds me of the camping  scenes in The Parent Trap.  A truely classic episode.
These are two of  the greatest episodes from the first season of The Brady Bunch, and is an  excellent addition to your home library.",963446400,13,684,4.608333333333333
