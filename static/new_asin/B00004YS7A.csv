1378073,4,B00004YS7A,Jackie Gleason at his best & a must-own for all Tina Louise fans; the rock group playing in the movie played great music as well,1364256000,,128,4.16
1378074,3,B00004YS7A,"America's favourite comedian gets all caught up in the Age of Aquarius when his free-thinking daughter drops out of college to join a rock group and search for spiritual enlightenment under the guidance of a bumbling Persian mystic. But there's a twist to the usual generation gap scenario. Bob's wayward kid wants to do the ""establishment thing"" by tying the knot with her composer boyfriend while her parents have (secretly) decided to call it a day on the marital front.

Hope's shot at impersonating the aforementioned guru, complete with flowing robes, turban, fake beard and a drooping orchid which he uses to ""bless"" his ""disciples"" provides plenty of chuckles. Another change of costume sees him decked out in a Nehru jacket and sporting a groovy hairstyle as he takes a ""space trip"" to some pot-filled Go-Go joint down on Sunset.

Although a few of the gags fall flat others work just fine as Bob and Jackie Gleason team up to add some real sparkle to the film's better moments.

Hope to the perpetually loaded Gleason: ""And about your breath... you could start the windmill on an old Dutch painting"".

Bob had just about lost interest in the big screen by this late stage, having decided to concentrate on his top rating TV shows instead. This was, in fact, his second last theatrical release.

Contrary to what many critics would have you believe, this is not a totally bad movie. It's actually a pretty sharp satire of some of the more nonsensical, new age clap trap that was permeating western culture at the time. Even the Beatles quickly realized that they were being taken on a one way elephant ride to fantasyland by their own giggling guru.

As for this one, it's a low key walk - thru which doesn't demand much of its stars but it still generates enough laughs along the way to keep it going.

Not outstanding but fun",1325376000,2,1836,4.700934579439252
1378075,5,B00004YS7A,"Interesting Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason film.  The DVD quality is pretty good for this release from the Bob Hope Film Collection.  However, it is only presented in a full screen version.  Probably the most notable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see the only film appearance I know of for the folk-rock group The Comfortable Chair.",1246060800,,341,4.745762711864407

1378077,1,B00004YS7A,"For those who can't say anything bad about Bob Hope...watch this movie. Utterly unfunny, sometimes distasteful. Having seen Jackie Gleason in Smokey and the Bandit II and III, it's not hard to see how he was involved in such an awful movie. But I was surprised to see Bob Hope making a fool of himself as well.
About the only redeeming factor is seeing the decor, cars, etc. of the era. But you can get that in many much better 60's films. Pass on this one...unless you want to see the ""other"" side of Bob Hope.
Additionally, the transfer is awful. It is a pan & scan, cutting off valuable information on both sides. It is comparable to something AMC might show...except without the commercials.",1064275200,9,695,4.568
7927599,1,B00004YS7A,"Another movie that incorporates a large cast of famous major stars and it is still terrible. This is supposed to be a comedy, but it is mind-numbingly dull, and we don't even know what the point of it all is.

Bob Hope and Jane Wyman play a long-married couple who get in each others' way, and they mutually agree to a divorce without complications. But trouble comes when their daughter visits them with a man she wishes to marry-and the parents hide their divorce from them. On top of that, the man is a son of a highly cynical, selfish record producer (a miscast Jackie Gleason) who does not believe in marriage and wants his son not to marry, but travel with a hippie band, despite the son's interest in classical music.

This had the makings of a screwball comedy, but the laughs aren't there, and everyone seems in a hurry to get things over with. No surprise; the whole movie feels unpleasant rather than amusing.",1499040000,,920,4.536144578313253

7927603,2,B00004YS7A,"Dated generation-gap comedy was an improvement over the dismal vehicles that plagued Bob Hope's latter-day film career.  ""How to Commit Marriage"" (1969) generates occasional spark thanks to the only movie teaming of Hope and Jackie Gleason, along with the  presence of Jane Wyman, Leslie Nielsen and Tina Louise. Unfortunately, a weak script bogs down the sitcom-style hijinks. Hope and Gleason fans will get a few laughs out of this missed opportunity.",1425340800,,453,5.366197183098592

7927607,4,B00004YS7A,Good copy of the DVD. I saw this movie as a kid at the drive-in. It was pushing boundaries at the time and my folks lamented having taken me along (but I wasn't all that young). Bob Hope is always somewhat of a dope (in a good way) and all the surrounding characters are fun. Jackie Gleason is his main foil.,1374278400,,308,4.065573770491803
7927608,4,B00004YS7A,Bob Hope is a good character actor who allows his supporting cast to actually become part of the movie. I like it.,1371859200,,114,4.2272727272727275
