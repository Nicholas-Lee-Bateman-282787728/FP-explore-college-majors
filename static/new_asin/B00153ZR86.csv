Most everyone can ride their horses really well and there are good stunts, some I'm sure done by the actors themselves.  No horses are being tripped with wires, like you see in some of the old westerns.  My only problem is Peter Brown does not do a southern accent very well.  I guess that's because he's from New York. They don't have anything like this on television anymore.",1240876800,3,456,4.6625
3140326,1,B00153ZR86,"I returned the two Larado sets I purchased because of poor Video quality. If a person has an older T.V. set it would probably be Okey, but I have a 50"" HDTV. I was very disappointed.

3140327,5,B00153ZR86,"Some of the season two episodes have strange plots - sort of like James Bond meets F Troop. All of the season one regulars are here, with the addition of Robert Wolders. Wolders doesn't seem to really fit in with the rest of the Rangers but he's handsome and easy to watch. William Smith as Joe Riley gets new clothes, making him even better looking than he was in season one. I'm looking forward to the release of season two, part two, and highly recommend purchasing all of the episodes released so far.",1224374400,,505,4.440860215053763
3140328,4,B00153ZR86,"Season 2 of Laredo is sillier and goofier than Season 1, highlighted by the addition to the cast of Robert Wolders as Erik, a Dutch Ranger who dresses in outrageous outfits, including paisley jackets!  Apparently, because Neville Brand had a drinking problem, the producers had to work around his often unreliable behavior, so Wolders was added to the cast so that Brand did not have to do as much.  Toward the end of the season, Claude Akins more or less substituted for Brand.  The episodes suffer when there is less of Brand.

Unlike the DVD Sets from Season 1, these 13 episodes are presented in broadcast order -- not that it makes much difference, as there's hardly any continuity between episodes.  You can find the episode guide to the series here, and season 2 begins with episode 31:

[...]

The shows are on 3 dual layer DVDs, each in its own slim case, so it takes up less space on your shelf that the 1st Season sets.

Quality wise, the episodes are all over the map.  Some look very good, others are grainy with a lot of compression.  Some episodes have over-saturated color, and ""Last of the Caesars"" is overly bright.  Just like the first season sets, these episodes have no chapter stops within them, nor do they display elapsed time.  There are no special features, nor any information about the specific episodes on the packaging other than the titles.

It's too bad that Timeless Media didn't put some more effort into this series, but at least they're available to enjoy, uncut.  So despite the uneven technical quality, there's a lot of fine entertainment here, even if the overall show content lags behind Season 1.",1223164800,4,1638,4.701754385964913

Saddle up and enjoy the show.  No cussing, no blood gushing and no political messages here.  Just fun and excitement.  Well worth the time and the small investment.  For those who have not seen this series, well, you are in for a treat.  The only problem is that there were only two full seasons.  Oh, well, enjoy the two again and again.
