8507039,2,B006ZL1PHA,"Bugz is targeted for small children, 3-5 yrs or so.  It is an adult (presumedly a mom talking with a child three or so.)  They show a bug on what looks like a white table and they talk about it.  The young child is hard to understand.  The dvd moves slowly, and they talk slowly.  I don't know how many bugs they talk about, as I didn't watch the entire video.",1374710400,2,360,4.014084507042254
