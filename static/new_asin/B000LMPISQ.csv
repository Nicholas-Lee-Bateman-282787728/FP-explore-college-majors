2710694,4,B000LMPISQ,It is nice to see a video which give the hold points needed on the different station.  Improved my score after one view,1365465600,,119,4.173913043478261
2710695,5,B000LMPISQ,"An outstanding teaching video! Ken Robertson takes the viewer through the fundamentals of trap shooting step-by-step. The presentation is very informative and covers correct shooting stance, basic trap technique, and proper aim & lead for each of the 5 stations. He works individually with five students -- each with varying skills and unique shooting issues. This approach is most helpful and from the various tips, I was able to correct some of my own hidden mistakes.

I've shot clay targets for many years, yet learned much from this fine instructional video. Ken is a championship shooter and an exceptional educator who is able to effectively reach both novice and experienced sportsmen. Despite other luke warm reviews of this video, I can highly recommend this presentation to anyone wanting to shoot trap successfully. It offers a solid foundation for the aspiring trap shooter...  and can help correct the information gap and errors of more seasoned shooters.

I've watched this excellent video several times and have taken careful notes, especially on aim point & lead at the various stations. With the help of Ken's instruction and two weeks of working on these lessons, I just broke my first 100 birds without a miss. Thanks much Ken!",1354147200,7,1247,5.102941176470588
2710696,3,B000LMPISQ,"I learned somethings.  Maybe I was expecting to much.  Going to watch it again.
Practice make you better.  Its Okay",1352764800,,115,4.65
2710697,4,B000LMPISQ,"A good intro to trapshooting, The material is quite dated (around 1984) and the production rather amateurish by today's standards, but the instruction is solid if a bit technical for beginners. Still, there are enough fundamentals here to improve almost anyone's game. Wish there was more detailed coverage of proper gun fitting though.",1316044800,5,336,5.3584905660377355
2710698,5,B000LMPISQ,Improved my scores by about 10% which equals two to three extra pigeons per round.,1423958400,,82,4.533333333333333

2710700,5,B000LMPISQ,"Good basic information, i.e. where to put your eyes, mounting your shotgun, weight distribution and follow through. We watch it every year, before the season begins, just as a refresher.",1421712000,,186,5.233333333333333
2710701,5,B000LMPISQ,"I had just received and watched ""Trap Shooting my Way"", by Harlan Cambell and was greatly disappointed. I still needed a trap instruction video since Harlan's was extremely lacking in clear useful information and had very wordy seemingly endless explanations that were about as interesting as watching paint dry.

Despite the comments of this video being a bit dated it had fairly good comments so I decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This is an absolutely excellent trap instruction video and only cost one third as much as Harlan's very poor and confusing presentation. This is by far the better instruction video and I highly recommend it.",1419379200,,673,4.9035087719298245
2710702,5,B000LMPISQ,Very dated but great basic teaching for beginners.,1406073600,,50,5.375
2710703,5,B000LMPISQ,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband, who is a beginning trap shooter.  Even though the lesson material was filmed quite a while ago, the instruction is timeless, informative and very professionally done.  He learned a great deal from it.  A very good buy!",1403568000,,262,4.531914893617022
2710704,4,B000LMPISQ,"There's good & bad.
BAD:  The film was made 20 - 30 years ago, and looks like it was converted from either 16mm film or from video tape to digital.  As a result, the color is a bit washed out, and you CANNOT see the clay pigeons fly when the shooters are shooting.  This definitely takes away from the instruction.  Pachmayer DEFINITELY needs to do a ""remake.""
GOOD:  The instructions and tips are as valuable today as they were when this film was originally made.
I am a trap shooter, and I am just starting into a ""bit of skeet.""  Both the instructional film on Skeet and it's mate, the one on Trap, have a wealth of instruction and shooting tips.  In fact, you will have to review these films several times in order to be able to absorb all of what is being taught.  Without an updated version of this video, this is probably the best instructional video available at this time.",1393718400,3,881,4.361963190184049
2710705,4,B000LMPISQ,Great detail and step by step instructions from each position.  Definitely helped my shooting.  I found his critique of each his students to be particular useful because they each had different things they had to work on.  The only thing I wish the video had is a graphic demonstration on how much lead and gun positioning graphics so the viewer can fully comprehend how much ahead his barrel should be.  The video is a little dated (check out their clothes!) but the information is not.,1371686400,,487,4.694117647058824
2710706,5,B000LMPISQ,this was shot in the early mid 1980's on film then VHS and now DVD.  The information on techniques is priceless and worth the money.  I should caution you he uses the lead method to shooting.,1371168000,,191,4.277777777777778
2710707,5,B000LMPISQ,"This DVD is very informative for both the beginner and the person who has shot for a while, but still can't master the skill.  Study and you learn something.  1970s styles may be outdated, but the information is not.  Just what I was looking for my son in his third year of shooting sports.",1369094400,,290,4.333333333333333

8162357,3,B000LMPISQ,"Video here is very dated! I believe this was originally made in the late 80's. Nonetheless, it does give accurate information for the beginner to intermediate shooter. I've been away from the sport for awhile and have this very same video on VHS (again, very dated material here but not a bad vhs to dvd transfer),...and now that I'm retired, thought that I'd give it a view again. It seems tedious at first however, this pre-dates the You-Tube era by 20 or so years. It did help me and re-reminded me of my ""hold"" positions over the trap house!",1497916800,,545,4.515151515151516

8162362,4,B000LMPISQ,Decent Video but sort of dated. Still worth watching though.,1447113600,,60,5.1
