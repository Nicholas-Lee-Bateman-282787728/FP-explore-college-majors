2828770,4,B000PY52DQ,"I understand every team should have their history on DVD but there are other teams with a more consistant history of winning that should be put on DVD. The Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins come to my mind when I think what teams are most deserving but NFL Films has missed so far. Of course even though I am a Bucs fan no one should expect a history of the Bucs, Saints, and Lions to come out anytime soon. The Skins and Fins should be next.",1180915200,,447,4.209302325581396

2828773,4,B000PY52DQ,"Second disk was the complete Superbowl III and presented excellent. I am a Colts fan, so I knocked off one star because of that. The first disk was the history of the Jets and attempted to make something out of a team that basically has done nothing since Superbowl 3. A Jets fan would like it. I threw it away.",1419206400,,311,4.2
2828774,4,B000PY52DQ,I would give it 5 stars if only (a) this was a more recent production; (b) the Jets had a more winning history,1415232000,,110,3.8260869565217392

2828777,4,B000PY52DQ,"The reason I bought this is because it contains Superbowl III. With that having been said, I still thoroughly enjoyed the history portion too. Now let me explain why I gave it four instead of five stars. I did it because the Superbowl III presentation is NOT the original NBC TV broadcast. No, but it's still a great presentation. I like it because it shows film taken by NFL films that you won't see anywhere else. And it is a play-by-play summary of the game. You also get some perspective from Jet players who played in Superbowl III. So that's all good. But I'd still love to have the original NBC TV broadcast of that historic game. But anyway, if you're like me and love the history series, you'll enjoy this one too. Get it, you can't go wrong.",1398729600,,751,4.410071942446043

2828780,5,B000PY52DQ,"If you are a Jets fan, like myself ( yes, I have asked myself why also), this is a must in your library.  Whenever the Jets manage to put that knife into your heart again with some stupid mistake, just take this out and remind yourself that we are not really crazy after all.  They DID win that super bowl with Joe way back then! It wasn't a big hallucination.  This dvd is great.  It has a lot of great stuff in it, along with Super Bowl 3 in it's entirety as well.  Hours of Jets highlights (even if most of them do fit on this one dvd set....just kidding).  All joking aside, I highly recommend this DVD.  It is well worth the money, and would make a great gift (just not to a Patriot fan).  I cant believe it actually talks about that pre season game against the Giants in 1969.  I was at that game!  The Jets played that game like it was a playoff.  Enjoy this DVD.",1359590400,2,870,4.0588235294117645

2828782,4,B000PY52DQ,"I am a forty + years jets fan... It had alot of great Jets inclusions, but it was a bit too simplistic, homer-ish, and ommissive of alot of historical Jet detail...  There was so much more it should have included, even from a negative point of view, because, let's face it, there is alot of negativity in the Jets history... For every big win and moment, there are two bad losses. or moments that they ignored, or glossed over... I got it 5 years after it was produced [Before the Rex era], but for a great price, as a new item, so I feel like it was a great buy, and an overall good watch...",1358035200,,592,4.147826086956521

2828793,5,B000PY52DQ,"With nearly 6 hours of video coverage.  I believe that is enough to satify most Jets fans and even some Jet Green bleeders too.

Coverage is from the Jets inception, thier playoff appearances and thier too few playoff wins.  Except of course our glory year, 1968, where we went all the way, won Superbowl III and forced a merge of the two leagues which lasts to this present day ! (a very nice extended piece on this one).

No cons on this DVD.  Except for me, a lifetime suffering Jets fan who has owned season tickets for the past 25 years.  I figured I my face would pop up on this video somewhere. (LOL).

2828794,4,B000PY52DQ,"Being a Jets fan is an experience of euphoric highs and crippling lows. Our team will never win a game by a comfortable margin when they could instead perform a 4th quarter comeback with 2 mins left on the clock. It's all about near  misses and near victories with the Jets and this collection demonstrates that on every level.
You wouldn't instinctively choose a team who's had only 1 classic team a decade to be the basis of an in-depth DVD retrospective but it is a testament to the passion with which Jets fans follow their beloved green & white that this is exactly what NFL Films have done.
As would be expected the production values and game footage are second to none and although the material is overly weighted towards the 1969 Superbowl win I still managed to learn quite a few new tidbits from the other features on offer here.
The only slightly disconcerting thing is that the makers seem to have decided that witnessing a loss by their team would be too much for the average Jet fan so season reviews and team retrospectives tend to end with the last Jet win rather than showing you the loss that put them out of playoff contention. This feels a little strange, especially when you aren't even shown touchdowns that other teams score for fear it may damage your fragile sensibilities.
Having said this I thoroughly enjoyed viewing all the material on hand and as a document of the Jets soaring highs and sweeping lows to date it certainly ticks all the boxes.

2828795,5,B000PY52DQ,"This DVD set was more than I had hoped for. The video quality was excellent and the content was complete. All the various periods of the NY Jets history was covered. The extra video clips, like the Curtis Martin one, were really good. A personal touch that made it a pleasure to view. I will make it a point to watch it 1-2 times a year.",1192579200,2,337,4.121212121212121
2828796,5,B000PY52DQ,"As a longtime Jets fan, I must say that this DVD is a must-see for all Jets fans alike. I'm 25 and I've been following the team since I was 10 years old, and of course I've seen Joe Namath and Super Bowl III on film. Before now, all of the memories and legends before and after that only existed for me in stories and pictures.

They are alive and well here in full form. From the early days of the New York Titans to Richard Todd, Dennis Byrd, The Sack Exchange and Kenny O'Brien, to the not so great days of early 90's and this DVD truly lets you re-live the moments and for some live them for the very first time. I never imagined so many great and heartbreaking moments existed.

A must have for Jets fans young and old alike.",1186617600,5,730,4.0979020979020975
2828797,5,B000PY52DQ,"As a kid from Southern California..you might be wondering why I am a fan of Joe Namath? I never liked the Packers or COlts (they were competitors to my Rams)...and The RAIDERS were jerks even back when they were good in the early 60's...and along came Joe...and his white shoes.  Even as a young football fan I could tell he  had style and his release and touch were mezmerizing...
IT was a huge achievement when the JETS brought down the NFL and the mighty COLTS and changed that league forever.

That Game is well documented on Disc 2 as well as in a special feature on disc two that's a half hour seasonal highlight reel. Disc one has the history of the team and  a generous section on Joe and his band of underdog champions....and it was terrific.  At a generous 340+ Minutes this is a very good value and watching that old AFL action is priceless...I grew up watching  that era  and seeing those old Chargers and Chief teams.....wow..what a rush of nostalgia...

Nice interview footage as well..
real solid package and I'm sure lifelong Jets fans ....particularly those in  NEW YORK will  treasure this collection of films!",1186531200,23,1128,4.623115577889447
2828798,5,B000PY52DQ,"I stumbled over this typing in NY Jets.  Being a Jets fan, I have to say that it's about time they have their own DVD.  How many DVD's do you have of the Steelers, Indy, Giants, & our dreaded rivals, the Patriots?  I'd like to have a DVD that has the complete Super Bowl III on it,(since, I wasn't even born, yet, when we got our first, & only, win.)  But this will do.  Plus I think it'll be a bit longer before we see another trophy.  Though I hope to see it in Pennington's era.  He definately seems to be our man.",1186444800,3,517,3.9611650485436893
2828799,5,B000PY52DQ,"Jerseybill is an idiot! The JETS do deserve their own DVD. It's overdue. The description says it all. ""TO LOVE THE JETS IS TO DREAM."" This is just the type of item I need to get me even more pumped up for the football season. The Jets have an amazing history...of losing. We have the biggest win in the history of football but after that there is nothing. Heartache after heartache. While I am sure this DVD will relive some of those moments I hope it goes into some of the touching ones as well a la Dennis Byrd. I don't want another DVD that reflects on Broadway Joe, rather the JETS themselves and this looks like excatly what I have been waiting for. Leon Hess up above help us out in 07....please!",1183939200,5,702,4.285714285714286
2828800,5,B000PY52DQ,Jerseybill is an idiot that obviously doesn't know a thing about the New York JETS. The title of the DVD is the HISTORY of the New York JETS not the winning history of the New York JETS.,1183075200,12,186,4.054054054054054

8193851,4,B000PY52DQ,"I recommend this for the AFL era coverage.  The Titan years were fully covered.  I would have liked more in depth coverage from the 1965-1967 years, but its the most complete coverage we are likely to get.  The Super Bowl content was excellent.  I had to buy the Kansas City Chiefs history DVD fpr more complete coverage of the 1969 first round playoff loss.  The Jets would have won the 1969 season Super Bowl against the Vikings if they had advanced past that game.  I'm glad they included the San Fran near comeback in the early 1970s, because it was one of the best games I attended.  The AFC coverage was a different story.  Somehow the season ending losses were scantly mentioned, if at all, for the playoff teams.  I don't know how you can call this complete without them.  You won't see any of the Rex Ryan era Jersey Jets, but I added a star because of it not being included.  Also, no Geno Smith locker room knockouts.  Another star added.  I'd recommend this for those who want to remember the good ole' days, before Leon Hess and Woody Johnson took ownership, the team moved from New York to New Jersey, and became allergic to Super Bowls.",1456704000,,1151,4.475961538461538
8193852,5,B000PY52DQ,"Jets: The Complete History (2007) is an awesome NFL Films collection of footage and documentaries on the history of the New York Jets, who originated in the AFL and won the AFL Championship before playing the NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III on January 12, 1969.  The second DVD in this set has basically a drive thru version of Super Bowl III.  Nearly every play of the game is shown, but it gets to the point rather than showing the entire game.  You'll hear Curt Gowdy calling the game.  During the game, every once in a while you'll see and hear commentary by some of the players on both teams as well as the head coaches, who give analysis of the game.  Also on Disc Two are bonus features - The Coaches, The Midnight Miracle, 1968 Jets Highlight Film, and 1998 Jets Highlight Film.  Disc One features the complete history of the team from its AFL days up until the then current day (2007).  The Bonus Features are excellent, with features on Curtis Martin, Herman Edwards, Wayne Chrebet, The Sweetest Victory, Duel Of Legends, The Miami Rivalry, Super Bowl III - An All-Star Tribute, and Joe and the Magic Bean, a feature that was filmed in 1971.

Quite a bit of attention is given to Joe Namath, what makes him tick, his legacy, etc.  Attention is also given to the historical significance of Super Bowl III and how it changed pro football forever.  The first few Super Bowls had the NFL champions competing against the AFL champions.  As a result of the Jets' victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III, all ten of the AFL teams were absorbed into the NFL, thus creating the American Football Conference (AFC) that we know today.  The Jets' win in the Super Bowl showed that an AFL team could defeat an NFL team and that the AFL was not an inferior football league to the NFL.  You'll also see interviews with lots of celebrities who remember Super Bowl III and their reflections on that game.

If you want a really awesome history of the New York Jets, then I highly recommend this DVD set.",1441843200,2,2011,4.5041322314049586
