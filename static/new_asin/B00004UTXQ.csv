7924069,5,B00004UTXQ,"I have loved Gundam Wing every since I first saw it on Cartoon Network.  Then, I fell in love with it even more when I saw the uncut versions at midnight.  Now, I can get the videos with the uncut episodes!  This is the best ever!  I really love the scene with Heero and Sylvia at Marshall Noventa's grave.  When she calls him a coward.....  Well, you should get this and see for yourself.",985046400,3,389,4.1891891891891895
7924070,5,B00004UTXQ,"This series just keeps getting better and better!  I am at work when they air on TV, so I am seeing all the episodes for the first time as I buy the tapes, and I cannot wait for the next video!  The characters in these episodes are cooler than ever.  Relena is starting to act instead of just react; Zechs is beginning to see the way things really are; all the characters are growing more and more dynamic and interesting.  This is the most complex, thought-provoking cartoon I have ever seen!  Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good story with their action!",974332800,4,565,4.446601941747573
7924071,5,B00004UTXQ,"The great series continues... In episode 14, Heero heads to Marseille to see Silvia Noventa, grandaughter of Marshal Noventa who he killed in episode 7.  He give her the chance to take revenge over her grandfather's death.  Meanwhile, Noin brings Relena to a meeting of the Romafeller Foundation, and Treize is told by his superiors that Zechs must destroy 01 which he has been rebuilding. Zechs does this, but the real Mobile Suit rests underwater. In episode 15, Heero and Trowa are tracked down so they escape with Noin to Antarctica where Zechs wants to battle Heero once more. On the way, a search party finds them, but Trowa comes to the rescue in Heavy Arms.  Meanwhile, Relena discovers that Heero is still alive and tries to contact him. In episode 16, we get to see one of the coolest battles in the series, between Zechs (in Tallgeese) and Heero(In HeavyArms). Unfortunately, Relena decides she must stop this battle herself.
These 3 great episodes further the storyline, while giving us plenty of cool action sequences.",971395200,9,1031,4.88
7924072,5,B00004UTXQ,"If you were ticked off that Heero and Zechs never finished their fight, then you're gonna want this tape.  After Zechs destroyed the fake 01, he  invited Heero and Trowa down to Antarctica so he and Heero could finish  their fight.  While there, Trowa unleashes a really cool move.  He says one  of the coolest things to say before killing another MS pilot.  ""Those  who have laid eyes on a Gundam shall not live to tell about it.""  Then  he dives at a grounded Aries and spins around repeatedly with his knife  whiped out.  The Aries is just cut to pieces and then explodes.  Heero  agrees to fight Zechs, however he refuses to accept Zechs gift of the  rebuilt 01 and takes the Heavyarms instead. This is the only time you will  see Heavyarms use a beam saber.  This video is even better because it's  uncut.",965865600,2,810,4.431506849315069
7924073,5,B00004UTXQ,"This video has got action coming out the wazoo!  Zechs is secretly rebuilding 01(Heero's Wing Gundam) much to the dislike of the Romafeller  Foundation.  He destroys a dummy 01 and transports the real one to  Antarctica.  Trowa pulls of this really sweet spinning knife of death move  to finish off a grouded Aries.  And the big finish is the rematch between  Zechs and Heero, and this time, Heero hops into the Heavyarms to battle to  the death with the Tallgeese.  If your a fan of Gundam Wing than this is a  must have.  In fact, the next video will start with the Gundams heading to  battle in space.  Parents will love this because it is edited.  It got a  TV-Y7 rating on Cartoon Network, so 7 and up is about the right age range.",965865600,,736,4.380597014925373
