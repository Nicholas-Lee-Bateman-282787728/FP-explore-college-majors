2629169,2,B000H6SY8M,"As other reviewers note... this one just doesn't meet the standards of the two previous DVDs in the series.  I'm not at all bothered, and neither is my child, by Elmo's Dad shaving off his mustache OR Prairie Dawn's Mom getting a more contemporary hairstyle... their voices and mannerisms are the same.  It's just like in the real world... peoples looks vary over time.  But, I was bothered by the poor sound quality of the ""live"" recordings between Matt and Romy.  Also, their interaction wasn't as cheerful as prior parent/child segments.  Matt really seems to be quizzing Romy the whole time.  Not too much fun to watch.  And, the songs are not as ""catchy"".  Overall, disappointing.",1168128000,,685,4.844827586206897
2629170,5,B000H6SY8M,"My 22 old month daughter Loves it as much as she did ""Beginning Together"". I don't like Matt's interaction with his daughter as much as I do Brandy with hers (in ""Beginning Together"") but my daughter doesn't mind so why should I? Prairie Dawn's Mom's look confused me as well but again, my daughter is ok with it. I just figured she changed her look just like real people do. I recommend this video for the teaching of senses.  It made me realize that I can do much more than I have done in the past. I just purchased ""Make Music Together"". I hope she likes it just as much as she does the other two.",1168041600,,600,4.172413793103448
2629171,1,B000H6SY8M,"Our 13 month old daughter is a sesame street fanatic since she was 9 months old!  We owned the first two ""sesame beginnings"" DVDS and she just loves them both. She dances and claps her hands to the music, and her smile just lites up the room.  I was so excited when I had seen the new Sesame Beginning DVD, ""Exploring Together"", so, naturally I ordered it. VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTING!!! The music was disappointing and boring. My daughter's attention span was limited for this particular video.  I hope the next video will be better!",1164672000,,532,4.638297872340425
2629172,2,B000H6SY8M,I agree with the previous reviewer.  The sound quality is different.  My 14 month old son loves the first two of this series.  I wouldn't bother buying this one.  He loses interest after 5 minutes too.  The songs aren't that exciting and start to sound simliar after awhile.  Maybe this one would be better for kids over 2.,1164499200,,323,4.482758620689655
2629173,3,B000H6SY8M,"My 14-month-old son and my 2-year-old niece enjoyed watching the first two (Beginning Together and Make Music Together), so I thought that purchasing the third one would be a good investment.  This third one seems to be filmed differently (I can hear lots of background noise when the parents and Matt/Romy are being taped) and Prairie Dawn's mom and Elmo's dad are different.  My niece was confused and didn't know who those two characters were.  Her comment was, ""That doesn't look like Prairie Dawn's mom!""  I think that the Muppet interaction and the music are great, but my niece and son have attempted to watch this video at least 6 times, and every time, they loose interest about 5 minutes into it.  I really wish that Sesame Street would have kept the third movie the same as the first two!",1164412800,,799,4.678571428571429
2629196,5,B000H6SY8M,"We have all of the Sesame Beginnings. This was our last one to purchase because of the reviews, I was skeptical. Yet this one was great too. My son enjoyed it and I didn't hear overwhelming background noise. Its a good one too.",1245888000,,227,4.3023255813953485
2629197,5,B000H6SY8M,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews since we and our 1 year old daughter LOVED It!  She's hard to please when it comes to videos, and usually is attracted by music and real kids, not animation.  This was perfect since she also enjoys the puppets.  I thought the interaction w/ Matt and his daughter was natural and the background noise, though noticeable, was not annoying to me.  This was our first video experience of the series, so not a lot to compare it to.  But we did watch the Music Making one today and my daughter was not as intrigued - because there is less parent/child interaction in that one.  Catchy theme song too - ""wiggle"" song.
I also recommend ""Baby Genius: Favorite Children's Songs"" DVD for babies.",1244246400,,722,4.6015625
2629198,5,B000H6SY8M,"I think these videos are wonderful, and very educational. I watch them with my daughter. I love to watch her smile and laugh at the baby characters. I recommend them to everyone. I loved sesame street when I was growing up. Now she can enjoy them too.",1223942400,,251,4.361702127659575
2629199,1,B000H6SY8M,"It isn't that videos for kids 0-2 can't teach them anything, or entertain them a great deal - its just that doctors and researchers have noticed that it greatly impairs more subtle development during these crucial years. Sesame Street started out with a very noble purpose: reaching latchkey and inner-city youth with some of the best educational methods available.

They are now on the other side of the same research - this is about getting kids hooked on their brand. I'm sure they have good intentions (such as that it'll draw the kids to their worthwhile material as they grow up) but they'd be much better off putting these funds into spreading the message: don't make a habit out of planting any kid under 2 in front of a TV set. You'd be surprised how few (4%) parents are aware that the Academy of Pediatrics has been urging this for years now.",1218672000,,853,4.6118421052631575
2629200,2,B000H6SY8M,"We purchased the first two in the Sesame Beginnings DVDs for our daughter and loved them.  They have been viewed a hundred times easily.  This one, however, was a big disappointment.  As others have stated, the sound quality  is very poor.  During the human segments, you can hear the background noise from the street outside, and it is almost louder than the people in the DVD.  I can't believe that this made it past the final editing/screening process.  The charm of the Sesame Street characters is still there, but is really lessened by the lackluster music.  The other DVDs in the series have fun, catchy music that my husband and I began singing to her after hearing only once or twice.  The songs in this one are unremarkable and boring. All of them.  It didn't help that the music volume is inconsistently lowered during songs, thus rendering them almost awkwardly a capella.  I didn't have any problem with Matt Lauer's interaction with his daughter, though, yes, as another reviewer stated, he does question her a lot.  She was a cute little girl, and all parent/child relationships are different. Clearly she knows her daddy, and he obviously loves her.  The overabundance of questioning isn't limited to Matt Lauer.  It appears to be the goal of this DVD as all the parents annoyingly over-question the children.  Obviously, the writers/director were going for this. They beefed up the parent/child interaction segments in this one, and it was overdone.  Previously, they were fun and incorporated into the music.  In this one, they simply interrupt the flow.  Yes, our daughter will watch this one some, but there is an obvious difference in her enjoyment of it.  She smiles and squeals at the others and gets bored watching this. The fact that the adults seem to dislike this one is also important.  After all, we are much more likely to put in the DVDs that we like, have fun with, and get inspired to play by. Overall, this one is a big disappointment.  The sound, editing, and music are poor.  I'm wondering if there was a change in sound and music directors between the first two DVDS and this one.  I was disappointed in this installment enough that we decided to order the next one, Moving Together, through our online DVD rental company first before deciding to make a purchase later.  If the decline in quality is the same as with this one, I don't want to make the same mistake again in spending money on it.  My recommendation is to skip this one, though the first two are superb.  (We are also big fans of the the Eebee videos.  Check them out!)",1215129600,2,2570,4.691275167785235
2629201,3,B000H6SY8M,"As many others stated, this one is not nearly as good as the first two in the series...Beginning Together and Make Music Together...but my sons (2 and 3 years old) still like it. It doesn't keep their attention quite so well, but they'll still watch it. Make Music Together is definitely the best of the three! At any rate...I'm still glad I purchased this DVD. Just not one that's watched over and over like some of our others. I'd definitely purchase the other two...especially Making Music Together...before getting this one!",1187481600,,528,4.877777777777778
2629202,1,B000H6SY8M,"We watched this twice before I gave it to my cousin for her baby.
It was totally annoying.  All the segments of the real parents and kids interacting were totally boring and irritating to both me and my children.
The songs were all repetitive and bland.
Matt Laurer and his daughter's interaction seemed forced and rehearsed.
There wasn't enough actual acting by the muppets and I was really turned off by most of this DVD with the real people.
The concept was good, but it totally could have been better.",1182816000,,505,4.611111111111111
2629203,4,B000H6SY8M,This one doesn't seem to catch my daughter's attention.  There's only one that does (Sesame Beginnings: Make Music Together).,1173484800,,125,5.578947368421052
2629204,5,B000H6SY8M,My 13 month old daughter absolutely loves this video.  The songs are also tolerable hearing over and over.  It is very cute!  We utilize the songs in our everyday lives with different situations to help our daughter learn!  Great video the only thing that could improve it would be more of it!,1168300800,,293,4.576923076923077
2629205,5,B000H6SY8M,"The folks at Sesame Street really nailed it by making a series of DVDs geared toward babies and toddlers. My son loves it, he's 18 months and has been watching the other 2 dvds in the collection since they came out. With this DVD coming out for the holidays we bought it for him. This DVD really focuses on them learning about their senses and body parts, and you can ask my son where is your nose, eyes, ears, and mouth and he points to them, and names them too! I really recommend this DVD.",1168300800,,492,4.189473684210526
8137028,5,B000H6SY8M,Baby is 10 months and these are the only dvds She likes- this one is pretty good- but the best one is making music. Received quickly & just like description.,1514332800,,157,4.266666666666667
8137029,1,B000H6SY8M,Probably the worst DVD every.  Half the DVD is the introduction song and the story line is horrible. I want to return because I was so disappointed!!! My 18 month old was not impressed!,1509580800,,185,4.4411764705882355
8137030,5,B000H6SY8M,Favorite series for over eight years. My kiddos love them :),1474156800,,60,4.545454545454546

8137034,5,B000H6SY8M,These movies can keep my son interested for hours! They're very cute and totally worth buying more then one of them!,1393545600,,116,4.571428571428571
8137035,5,B000H6SY8M,"I think this was an awesome purchase.
The quality of the DVD, even though it was used, is amazing.
My 6 month old baby watches at least once daily. It is his one and only TV allowance at this age.
Loves loves loves this video! It really calms him down.
This video and eebees. The only two that really does it for him.

Highly recommend this for your baby. :)",1344384000,,358,4.114285714285714
8137036,5,B000H6SY8M,My son went through and Elmo phase and so we got him all of these seasme biginning movies. He loved to sing along and dance. Great for kids to learn.,1333152000,,149,4.0
8137037,4,B000H6SY8M,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter at Christmas. We already had the ""Making Music Together"" DVD, which she absolutely loves, so we thought that we would add to the Sesame Street Beginnings collection with this DVD and the ""Beginning Together"" DVD. The music is generally very good with lots of interaction with the characters and their parent/caregiver. However, the dialogue with Matt Lauer and his daughter is noisy (really bad recording quality maybe, especially compared to the other DVD's) and a little forced in some areas. But my daughter doesn't notice those things! She loves the Smell a Smell song and it is the first time that she has laughed at something she saw on the TV - and we are talking full on belly laughs. So this is a good video to add to your collection if you (as an adult) can get over the Matt Lauer part.",1325548800,,834,4.566666666666666
