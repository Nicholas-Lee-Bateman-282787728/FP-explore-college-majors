8270194,4,B0018O4UEY,Really brings out the skills of USAF pilots.  Also a great recruiting tool.  I would like to see a video that touches on everyday USAF life.,1387065600,,140,4.346153846153846
8270195,5,B0018O4UEY,"I have already submitted my review, the documentary of the USAF was outstanding now amazon needs to bring public attention to the remaining branches of our military .",1380067200,,166,4.964285714285714
8270196,5,B0018O4UEY,Great look behind the scenes of the USAF Thunderbirds. If you've ever seen them perform then you'll be fascinated by how many people it takes to put together. My girls loved watching this movie and were in awe with the female Thunderbird pilot featured.,1365638400,,253,4.7727272727272725
8270197,5,B0018O4UEY,"The film ""America's Team"" takes an in-depth look at what is required of fighter pilots and their teams to put on a successful air show. This film also takes an inspiring look at the first female fighter pilot's inspirational story, and the sacrifices she made to get where she is. A great film!",1359590400,,294,4.566037735849057
8270198,4,B0018O4UEY,"The background of being a Thunderbird was really well done and overall I'm really glad I bought the DVD but.......

Why, why, why don't the people who make these videos understand that at least half the thrill of seeing high performance jet aircraft, such as the Thunderbirds or Blue Angels, is the NOISE.  The aerial footage is fantastic but would have been much better if we could actually HEAR the jets instead of the overbearing music.",1296000000,4,439,4.7631578947368425
8270199,2,B0018O4UEY,"some good footage, but i also have ""Blue Angels: A Year in the Life"" and the USAF Thunderbirds DVD doesn't compare.  The Blue Angels movie is a 2-disc set, and covers every aspect of the demonstration season.  From initial training, to all the maintenance stuff, etc.  The Thunderbirds DVD touches on these things, but doesn't have nearly as much detail as the blue angels one.  This DVD has really corny music that plays continuously throughout the whole movie, and the majority of the time it doesn't even fit the scene.

If you really want to know about an aircraft demonstration team, get the Blue Angels DVD (and this is coming from someone in the Air Force!)",1290988800,5,664,4.689655172413793
