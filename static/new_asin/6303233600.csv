604914,5,6303233600,"A re-telling the vampire idea, but with a totally different approach.  Cronos definately doesn't have an ""American feel"" to it, and maybe thats what makes it work.  It takes the idea that humans are selfish, always wanting to make our own life longer and more enjoyable, and it shows the extent some people will go to achieve this.  just waiting for it to be released on dvd.. not holding my breath..",996624000,5,400,4.605633802816901
604915,5,6303233600,"This is perhaps the most original film in the fantasy genre this decade, coming from an extraordinarily gifted director. In the mid-90s, a spate of independent films from Mexico in the genre of Magical Realism like  ""Like Water For Chocolate"" and ""El Mariachi"" came to  the notice of American art house cinema. Given that, this was still quite  an unexpected surprise. Like another brilliant film of the previous decade,  Near Dark (1987, director: Kathryn Bigelow), the ""v"" word is  never mentioned and never needs to be. This film trusts the audience's  intelligence and rewards it with an understated tale of a humble antique  dealer and his granddaughter when they accidentally stumble upon a  mysterious artifact that grants its user immortality at a price. The acting  is superb and you feel with the characters as they battle those who seek  possession of the device at any cost.",946512000,4,886,5.006849315068493

605133,5,6303233600,"Wow, there are some really polarized opinions about this film!

Personally, I loved it. But it's not hard for me to imagine that many people would find it unappealing. Guillermo del Toro is, first and foremost, a storyteller; and while that can [hopefully] be said about most directors, Del Toro's stories, IMHO, often come across almost as parable, which goes hand-in-hand with the fantasy/fairy-tale elements in most of his films. He often alters ""reality"" to create harmony, and he always involves childhood trauma, which, as a parent, can sometimes be a bit hard to stomach.

There are two things I really like about this film:
- One, I am a big fan of traditional gothic horror. I like the old Hammer horror flicks, as well as Vincent Price, H.P. Lovecraft et al. I like the sense of dread and unknown that permeates those films and stories, even if the ""actual"" horror is a bit hokey. This film has tons of that sort of atmosphere, and in my opinion delivers on it. I like newer stuff too, but my roots are gothic for sure.

- Two, as a life-long horror-film addict, I am always searching for some sort of novelty in these films. If I see one more film that starts out with five friends from college or an innocent family moving into a haunted house and ""awakening an unspeakable horror"" I'll shoot myself. It's very important to me to see a fresh story, because they're out there. The story in this film is exceedingly original if nothing else.

Plus, as a bonus, you get Ron Perlman.

So the upshot is it really depends on your particular slant towards the genre; if you like your horror flicks sort of formulaic and with more visual content than psychological--and there's nothing wrong with that--then you may prefer something else. For me though this film is a home-run.",1409011200,4,1781,4.659235668789809

605174,4,6303233600,"This was Mexican director Guillermo del Toro first feature film.  For those who are familiar with his work, it will come as no surprise that the film deals with the dark and sinister.  In this case, the film is a twist on the traditional vampire story.

A shopkeeper who deals in various artifacts such as clocks, puzzles, statues, etc. comes into the possession of a 3 foot porcelain statue of a boy.  Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) is the shopkeeper, a man in his 60's who along with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) are the primary caregivers for their 8 year old granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath).  We never learn what happened to her parents.  Jesus and Aurora are especially close and she accompanies him to his shop on a regular basis.

After a suspicious character takes an interest in a statue, Jesus looks at it more closely only to discover it hides a small box in the base.  He removes the box and hides it elsewhere.  Shortly thereafter a large man called Angel (Ron Perlman) buys the statue on behalf of his elderly uncle De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) who is dying of cancer and a variety of ailments.  De la Guardia has learned that the statue contained the device which was created centuries earlier.  It contains an insect of some type which never dies and in fact holds the key to immortality.

So now the chase is on to retrieve the box from Jesus.  In the meantime Jesus has investigated the device not knowing what it is.  When arthropod-like legs appear, the device attaches forcefully to Jesus's forearm.  Del Toro keeps things moving along with the scenes being mysterious and eerie rather than following a traditional ""B"" movie horror style.  There are no ""jump-scares"" but things get creepy as Jesus thirst for blood becomes more evident.  In the meantime, De la Guardia and Angel are determined to find the device.  De la Guardia's life depends on it.  Del Toro who also wrote the film, has devised some beautiful sets which again separates the film from its ""B"" brethren.

This Criterion Blu ray version comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Here is some information provided by Criterion regarding the transfer:  ""Cronos is presented in the director's preferred aspect ratio of 1.78:1. Director Guillermo del Toro and director of photography Guillermo Navarro supervised this new high-definition digital transfer, which was created in 2K resolution on a Spirit 4K Datacine from the original 35mm camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain, and noise reduction.

Telecine supervisors: Guillermo del Toro, Guillermo Navarro, Maria Palazzola.
Telecine colorist: Gregg Garvin/Modern Videofilm, Los Angeles.""

Here are some notes from Criterion regarding the audio: ""The stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from 35mm LT/RT magnetic soundtrack. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.""

The film is clean as a whistle and shows no scratches, flecks or other crud.  The muted colors are excellent throughout.  There is only one option for audio.  It is a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track and it is very good.  I noticed no pops or tape hiss or any other distractions.  The film is in Spanish, with some English and has English and English SDH subtitles.  There are a host of extras including a nice 40 page booklet with an essay by film writer Maitland McDonagh and Del Toro's 1991 notes.  Here are the rest:

*Audio commentary with Guillermo del Toro
*Audio commentary with Producers Arthur H. Gorson and Bertha Navarro and coproducer Alejandro Springall

As to the film, unsurprisingly from this wonderful storyteller, it's a new take on the vampire story. Great tale, superb acting, crazy characters, gorgeous production design it's a del Toro all the way. Frequent collaborator Ron Perlman is terrific as a thug with a vain streak. So movie worth it, extras, worth it, vintage del Toro (mostly in Spanish) and subtitled, which I think is great because I love to hear the original actors' interpretations.

605217,4,6303233600,"Guillermo Del Toro made his directorial debut with ""Cronos,"" which is part vampire story, part dark, gothic fairy tale, and part religious epic. It's about an antique shop owner, who with his granddaughter, finds a very disturbing little artifact buried in one of the antiques.

The artifact is a gold scarab looking object, with an insect inside that brings youth to whoever uses the scarab, known as the ""Cronos."" The antique shop owner soon finds himself being terrorized by goons who want to possess the scarab.

The story sounds very simple, but the stylish set pieces and dark humor mixed into the narrative really adds up to a startling fairy tale that grabs you by the throat early on, and holds onto you.",1388620800,3,713,4.788617886178862
605218,5,6303233600,"A new vision of the vampire myth involving an insect trapped in a device that grants immortality, an innocent grandfather, his all but silent granddaughter, a human monster and his victimized nephew.

An elderly antiques shop owner, Jesus Gris, and his granddaughter, Aurora, discover an unusually device in a four hundred year old Archangel statue. Gris inadvertently triggers the device which begins a change in him that not only slowly makes him more youthful in look and energy but infects him with an addict's consuming fixation for blood. Unfortunately for Gris, he is not the only one with knowledge of the device's existence and power, and he becomes the target of the dying businessman De La Guardia's desire for immortality at any cost and his violent nephew Angel.

Loved this film! Loved it! I've always had a thing for vampires and I really enjoyed this new view of the vampire mythology. This isn't just a new story of vampirism though, it is also a tale of family. The love, devotion, and acceptance of family is beautifully shown through the grandfather Jesus and granddaughter Aurora, as is the dark side of family, with it's violence, abuse and victimization, as shown through the obsessed De La Guardia and his nephew Angel.

Frederico Luppi is excellent as Gris. He brings a depth and ""every-man"" dignity to Jesus not often seen. A subtle, detailed performance.

Claudio Brooks is terrifying as the obsessed De La Guardia. A ""Dorian Gray"" portrait of a monster whose humanity lays in a tank with his diseased organs.

Ron Perlman is absolutely superb as Angel. He takes what could have been the average brute/thug character and gives him humor, depth, and the ability to evoke sympathy and, almost, forgiveness, from the audience.

Favorite line (narration describing the death of the Cronos device creator): ""His skin was the color of marble in moonlight.""

Definitely worth buying.",1387670400,2,1903,5.022222222222222

Federico Luppi, the lead actor, does a fantastic job. He is what holds this picture together. A very fine performance for this type movie.

Don't expect big budget special effects. This movie does not have the biggest budget. The storyline and writing is pretty good. The supporting actors were ok. This is not Ron Perlman's best work by a long shot. The actresses that played the wife and granddaughter did well.

One day while searching for interesting items to add to his store, he stumbles on an ancient golden object in the shape of a beetle yet when he winds it, the thing sprouts legs as it grabs his hand then sticks a sharp thing into him. Unknowingly to him, the immortal insect within the device gives him the power of eternal life and a thirst for blood. However, a dying rich man named Dieter De La Guardia (Claudio Brook) has learned the secret of the device as he wants to have it for himself as well with the help of his tough tall brutish nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to get it for him. Angel kills Jesus yet Jesus survives somehow as he escapes from the morgue as a vampire who seeks the help of his beloved granddaughter to help him reverse the process so he won't end up like the original owner of the Cronos device did.

This Mexican 1993 supernatural gothic horror drama fairy tale is the debut to one of the best directors in recent memory known as Guillermo Del Toro who has wrote and directed this movie. This movie is critically acclaimed for it's dark visuals and fairy tale-like storytelling as it does feel like what Guillermo has described with a different twist on vampire mythology. The performances are spot on including Ron Perlman who is fantastic in the English speaking role of Angel whom speaks a little Spanish in this movie as the film is spoken in both English and Spanish in subtitles. I first saw this when it hit video when i was 13 after hearing about it on Fangoria and from newspaper reviews to Siskel and Ebert's review on TV as i had to see it, it became the first non-dubbed foreign language film in subtitles besides Hard Boiled i ever saw and loved it, i became a fan of the director since.

This blu-ray from Criterion is just outstanding! it offers remastered restored picture and surround sound like never before as they are supervised by the director himself. This BD includes newly translated subtitles approved by Guillermo himself with 2 commentaries, a 1987 short film by the director entitled ""Geomatria"", optional original Spanish-language voice-over introductionWelcome to Bleak House"" a video tour by Del Toro of his home office and collection, video interviews with Del Toro with cinematographer Guillermo Narrao and Ron Perlman, interview with actor Fedrico Luppi, still gallery and trailer with a booklet with an essay by film critic Maitland McDonagh with experts from Del Toro's notes for thte film.",1372291200,2,2617,4.711790393013101
605223,4,6303233600,"Part of what makes ""Cronos"" so enjoyable to watch is the sheer amount of fun del Toro and Luppi clearly had making it. It's an easy-going horror movie, if such a thing can actually exist, and the tameness of all the gore and violence makes it very accessible and probably a good place to enter the genre.

To whit: centuries ago, an alchemist made a device that would prolong his life, but not make him invincible. When he dies in the early 1900s, the device is lost until it turns up in a present day Mexican antique dealer's showroom. While fiddling with the device, the dealer is ""stung"" by it, and he slowly begins to look younger and feel more energetic. He keeps running to the device despite the protests of his granddaughter and finds himself the target of two aggressive...manufacturing-boss type people...that pose a threat to his survival.

Someone earlier in the comments mentioned that this is a movie driven almost purely by character, which is an astute observation. The rules of the cronos device go delightfully unexplained, as the movie instead opts to show how an otherwise normal guy ends up in extraordinary circumstances. It's a mobster movie in all but the creepy macguffin. Also Ron Perlman is both goofy and deliriously sympathetic - it's hard to explain.

The cronos device is also fascinating and inventive, and it's almost worth watching the movie just to see how del Toro would envision a fountain of youth.",1371600000,2,1436,4.805668016194332

Awesome make-up. Again, love came to the forefront, repeatedly.

605274,3,6303233600,"Guillermo Del Toro has garnered quite the reputation as a director of horror films and deservedly so. It's not just that he's interesting on a technical level. His movies always have an odd spin to them. I doubt ""Mimic"" would have been anywhere near as interesting or good in the hands of most other directors. In ""Cronos"", his first feature length film, you already see some of the things he would go on to develop to a greater degree in his later successes.

Here's the scoop. An aging antiques store owner gets tipped off that a statue in his shop may contain something of great interest and value. Upon discovering it, a bug like contraption, he is ""stung"" by it. But the result is more than enjoyable. He uses it again, but, without the manuscript written by the inventor of the device, he doesn't realize he's opening himself up for real trouble. Meanwhile, another aging, wealthy man has sent his nephew (played by Ron Perlman) to do anything necessary to retrieve the contraption.

This isn't a great movie but it contains some great stuff. The story never turned where, or in a way, I thought it would. I was not able to predict what would happen in any given scene. There is not all that much plot here. The story is very sparse but it's the way Del Toro explores some of the nuances that works so well. What happens when an old man suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself reinvigorated? How far will he go to keep that feeling. And what about a person whose life is painful  due to never-ending maladies but wants to live longer nonetheless? What is so dear about life, even a painful one, where aperson simply cannot let go of it? And the device itself is interesting. The nifty ganglion of gears on the inside would be repeated later in ""Hellboy II.""

It's directed very well. Del Toro knows how to set up a shot. I never felt the camera was in the wrong place. It's cut well and the musical score is good. The performances are good. Perlman is always worth watching and he has a good character here. The young girl playing Aurora does a fine job even though she only utters one word of dialogue. The set designs are very good. Most of the sets are filled with nifty stuff but not so much that they seemed crowded. My eye was always searching the frame in a comfortable way.

If you're a fan of the horror genre of film this is a must see. It's not stupid and contains no cheap thrills. It's more for the adult sensibilities and well worth your time investment.",1319155200,,2474,4.464601769911504
605325,2,6303233600,"This rating is based on my preference for character relationships above special effects, so please take with a grain of salt, because this movie is great looking, and has some very cool ideas.

When Guillermo Del Toro both writes AND directs, it tends to produce his best movies, I think. I love The Devil's Backbone, and Pan's Labyrinth. But Cronos just didn't affect me the same way. The relationship between the granddaughter and grandfather felt un-fleshed out, and the movie became just a showcase for Del Toro's (admittedly great) special effects. And if that's what you're looking for, please do pick this movie up. It is a very original idea of vampirism, and the special effects are really fun. But if you are looking for another movie that is scary and devastatingly sad, like the director's other films mentioned above, you might be disappointed. The only character who really feels interesting and fleshed out is Ron Perlman's. And I think we may have Ron Perlman to thank for that.

The criterion collection comes with a strange and funny short horror film from del Toro's film school years. It's not particularly good, but it's fun to watch, and fun to hear him talk about it in the video interview.",1316649600,5,1213,4.826923076923077

I can't think of anything to say about it other than I found it utterly boring. Neither the story (which admittedly is intriguing for the first few minutes) nor acting nor actual film making engaged me on any level. Every half hour I'd glance at the clock wondering how much more there was to go... and discover only three minutes had passed since I last looked. It made me think of that Woody Allen quip: 'eternity is a long time... especially towards the end'.

Guillermo del Toro's debut film is quite effective - he doesn't play it so much for scares as for a pervading sense of horror, the horrific fascinations with what transgresses the human.  The film doesn't go for quick thrills, but creates an atmosphere of dread, and focuses on the impact on the life of a decent man and his relationships of an item that prolongs life in unnatural fashion.  Those familiar with his other works - both his movies and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strain/dp/0061558249/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strain</a>&nbsp;trilogy - will recognize here the heart of his familiar obsessions.  In particular the image of an alchemical union of organic life and machine, and of the parasitical relationship between human life and its other.  As with many of his works he includes here a witness, a young child who observes what is going on without judging because she has not yet developed the cynicism that rejects the possibility of the fantastic, and whose presence heightens the sense of danger.

The film parallels the structure of Cronenberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B0009X768W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>&nbsp;- and del Toro's sense of the horrific potential embedded in hybrids of man-animal-machine reminds me of Cronenberg's interest in ""the flesh.""  A difference is that del Toro traces the origins of this horror back to the era in which the birth of mechanistic physics overlapped with alchemical inquiries, whereas Cronenberg focuses on new technologies and their impact on human life.  While in some of his later films del Toro shows his fascination with fantasy elements such as ghosts and faeries, there is no magic here and the device is strictly this worldly even if it employs alternative technologies that were allegedly ""lost"" with the rise of mathematical and mechanical physics.

The extras here are fun, and essential viewing for fans of Guillermo del Toro's other work.  There's an early low budget short called Geometria, that he apparently finalized for its inclusion with this release, that combines the comic sensibility of early Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, with a look that seems to parody that of melodrama of Spanish and South American soap opera.  There are interviews with del Toro and the lead actors, and there's a fun trek through del Toro's house that is quite revealing about his fascinations and influences.

605332,4,6303233600,"Before the ""Hellboy"" films, ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""Blade II"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"", Mexican filmmaker, screenwriter and novelist Guillermo del Toro would write and direct his first film in 1993 known as ""Cronos"".

""Cronos"" would win various Golden and Silver Ariel Awards in Mexico and it would also be the first film which would feature a collaboration between del Toro and actor Ron Perlman who would later go on to work with del Toro in the ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"".

Despite receiving a limited release in the U.S. in two theaters, the film grossed $17,538 during its opening weekend and over $621,000 when it played on 28 screens.  The film received positive reviews from the critics and established director Guillermo del Toro's career in the U.S.  As for ""Cronos"", way before the emotional films of ""Twilight"" and before ""True Blood"" and even the popular ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series, ""Cronos"" was a vampire film unlike other vampire films that tend to focus on gore and the damsel being sucked dry by a vampire.  Because ""Cronos"" was so fresh and new, it was and still is considered by some vampire film fans as one of the best vampire films of all time.

But what ""Cronos"" would be known for is del Toro's way of departing from previous vampire films by making it intelligent, featuring a unique relationship between a grandfather and his granddaughter and giving the vampire a sense of humanity without being a cold-blooded killer nor the usual, banal vampire storylines that have made it onto film for nearly the last century.
ts to get used to his new life, Dieter de la Guardia's want the Cronos device and will try to get it by any means necessary, even if it means killing Jesus to get it.  Will Jesus survive the ordeal?

VIDEO:

""Cronos"" is presented in 1:78:1.  According to the Criterion Collection, Director Guillermo del Toro and director of photography Guillermo Navarro supervised this new high-definition transfer, which was created in 2K resolution on a Spirit 4K Datacine from the original 35 mm camera negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

It's important to note that while the DVD does look good, one wanting better picture quality should definitely get the Blu-ray disc release of ""Cronos"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Cronos"" is presented in stereo.  Dialogue is clear and according to the Criterion Collection, the stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm LT/RT magnetic soundtrack.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Cronos - The Criterion Collection #551' comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary by Director Guillermo del Toro - A wonderful audio commentary from 2002 by Guillermo del Toro.  Throughout the film, del Toro talks about the scenes and what he liked and what he didn't like (as he looks back on the film) because they were on a strict schedule, also interesting stories on construction of the Cronos devices and the things they had to go through to film on the morgue set.  Also, we get to learn a few interesting facts, especially about young actress Tamara Shanath which was quite interesting and unusual.  But Guillermo definitely gives us a good insight of why this film was created, a little story on his strict Catholic upbringing and how difficult his mother was and his fascination with horror films like ""Videodrome"", working with Ron Perlman and the various talent and more.
  * Audio Commentary by Producers Arthur H. Gorson, Bertha Navarro and Co-Producer Alejandro Springall - The producers talk about the film being shot in Mexico, getting actor Federico Luppi and Ron Perlman, talk about the makeup and effects, memories of screening the film at Cannes and more.
  * Geometria - (6:28) Guillermo del Toro's 1987 short horror film which was reworked with special effects.  Featuring an introduction (6:54) by Guillermo del Toro talking about the making of this short film and what he wanted to accomplish then but was difficult with only a $2,000 budget.
  * Welcome to the Bleak House - (10:15) Guillermo del Toro takes us on a short tour of his collections in his home and how he is expanding it to include his collection of toys, cinema but mostly a large collection of macabre movie and non-movie related items.  Let's just say that some of the things that del Toro has in his home (especially preserved in jars), I don't see many people wanting to have them in their home or collection.
  * Interviews - Featuring several interviews which include:

- Interview with Director Guillermo del Toro (17:35) in regards to working on ""Cronos"", the things he has learned since the filming (including some regrets that he has) and working with Ron Perlman and how he was fortunate to have him on his film but most importantly trust him.

- Interview with Guillermo Navarro (12:36) in regards to working as director of photography for ""Cronos"" and the longtime friendship and bond he and del Toro have in working on a film together.

- Interview with Ron Perlman (7:26) in regards to how he got involved in working on ""Cronos"", what he liked about the screenplay but also how he and Guillermo del Toro have continued to work in three more films since that first collaboration.

- Interview with Federico Luppi (5:26) in regards to working with del Toro, playing the character of Jesus Gris and working on ""Cronos"".

  * Stills Gallery - With your remote, you can view the various stills, rare photos (of his crew working on several versions of the Cronos device) and storyboard illustrations from ""Cronos"" with captions by director Guillermo del Toro.
  * Trailer - (1:28) The original theatrical trailer.

EXTRAS:

""Cronos - The Criterion Collection #551' comes with a 44-page booklet.  Inside is an essay titled ""Beautiful Dark Things"" by film critic, film writer and horror enthusiast Maitland McDonagh.  Also, included are excerpts from director Guillermo del Toro's notes for ""Cronos"" back in 1991 and shows us how much research he did in preparing for his screenplay for ""Cronos"".

JUDGMENT CALLL

Director Guillermo del Toro is one of the most prepared and quite intellectual filmmakers out there.

His life, even since he was a young child, has appreciated horror films, the macabre but also an appreciation for cinema that when he planned his version of a vampire film, he didn't want to go through the same path as other filmmakers who have done vampire films.  No need for the brooding blood-sucking vampire in his films, everything must have a purpose and in this case, even before this film was created, he had done incredible research on alchemy, Gothic films and being a cinema fan, especially a horror film fan, he is a man with a vast knowledge of these type of topics.

But what makes ""Cronos"" succeed and what makes it so unique is that the film doesn't want to follow the banality of kitschy horror films.  His vampires and for the most part, many of his films tend to make us feel sympathetic to those who have become the monster.  In this case, Federico Luppi's wonderful performance as a grandfather turned vampire is not your average blood sucking killer.  All he knows is that this Cronos device has given a chance of being younger and feeling more vibrant but at a cost that his body is constantly wanting human blood.  But will he lose his humanity or what is left of his humanity to follow the rules of the alchemist, of what one would do to achieve immortality.

""Cronos"" is well-written and despite not having a large budget, it's a film that works because it was created by a Guillermo del Toro who was not changed or deterred by the Hollywood studio system.  He was  man who knew what he wanted and got the performances that he wanted.  Granted, he does explain on the audio commentary that they were short on time and they faced significant obstacles while filming ""Cronos"" back in 1993.  And of course, with this release in 2010, Guillermo has said that he would have done things differently.

The fact is that director del Toro was able to tell a story with no studio telling him what to do and in someways, that ego of a first time director kind of helps in showing us his youth as director on this film.  Personally, if del Toro was able to redo this film, having experienced several big budget films under his belt after ""Cronos"", I wouldn't be surprised if he utilized visual effects and other modern day technology to make ""Cronos"" seem a bit more violent and bloody.

Personally, I felt that del Toro has done a wonderful job and if anything, ""Cronos"" is an important film that introduced the world to his talent as a new filmmaker during the early '90s and since then he has reaped the rewards with other films such as ""Pan's Labrynth"" and ""Blade II"".  And aside from being a well-known screenwriter and director, he has currently gone on to become one of Hollywood's most popular producers.

The film manages to capture emotion in a vampire film that many dare not try back then (granted, things have change now during these ""Twilight"", ""True Blood"" and ""Vampire Diaries"" years).  But even today, if you pitched a film about a grandfather turning to a vampire who has a close relationship with his granddaughter, it probably wouldn't fly with today's film studios who want more style over substance, ""Cronos"" had style but it also had substance and most of all it was not a film that was put on del Toro's lap nor was there a studio and execs telling him what to do.  ""Cronos"" was created because Guillermo had wanted to make this film and he did it his way and sure enough, it has paved the way for more films for the director to this day.

While some may question why ""Cronos"" was included on The Criterion Collection, for one, ""Cronos"" was an important film to come from Mexico.  Although there are a few Mexican films that are included on The Criterion Collection, the fact is that Guillermo del Toro is one of Mexico's famous directors and that also, ""Cronos"" did bring in a lot of attention to Mexican cinema back in 1993 and also a Mexican filmmaker that has reaped the benefits of years of hardwork and it is this film that did help pave the way for the success that he has received thus far.  ""Cronos"" was an audacious film at the time and one can easily watch and see why the film has received auspicious reviews.

For the faint of heart when it comes to horror films, ""Cronos"" is not a film with a lot of gore or bloody violence.  Granted, it has its share of violence and bloody moments but it's nothing gory or sickening and quite pedestrian in what is shows considering what we see in today's horror films.  I admit that there was one part which was gross.  But I have no doubt that if del Toro had his opportunity to redo this film as he wants to do with all his films, I wouldn't be surprised if he would take advantage of things much more visually and make it possibly a bit more grotesque.

Fortunately, the film is what it is and whether or not one wants more gore is subjective to the viewer.  Personally, I felt that the film didn't have to be another vampire film and showcase blood or gore, it was fine the way it is and if anything, the film builds on suspense and good old fashion storytelling.  The most you are going to see in this film is skin peeling off and that's pretty much it.  To tell you the truth, the only disturbing scene for me was mostly about a scene in which Jesus craves blood but where he finds it, I was just thinking of how unsanitary it would be for him to get his taste of human's blood in that area  (I would explain more but I would end up spoiling that scene).  But ""Cronos"" is not a film one would get scared or grossed out by.  So, for the Criterion Collection fans that are wondering if there are any disturbing scenes ala ""Salo"", ""Sweet Movie"" or ""Antichrist"" in this film... the answer is no.

As for the DVD, ""Cronos - The Criterion Collection #551' does have quite a few more special features than its older 2002 Lions Gate DVD counterpart.  For one you get the 44-page booklet with an essay by ""Flick Chick"" Maitland McDonagh (who definitely knows horror films) and also notes that del Toro made in 1991 and just giving you a wonderful insight of what he had in his head at the time and also showing his intellectual side and approach to planning the film at a young age.

And also, you get two audio commentaries (which were part of the 2002 DVD) but possibly my favorite featurettes that show his collection at his home ala ""The Bleak House"" and several interviews with del Toro, his cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi.  And for del Toro fans, you also get to see his 1987 horror short ""Geometria"" for the first time.  Although not as audacious as ""Cronos"", it does show you del Toro's willingness to do whatever he wanted and in this case, with a small budget, to create the most grotesque short that he can with the least amount of money.

Once again, if you want the better HD picture quality and lossless audio, I definitely recommend going for the Blu-ray version over the DVD version.  Otherwise, this Criterion Collection DVD for ""Cronos"" is a solid release.

Overall, for fans of filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, ""Cronos"" does make for a wonderful release by the Criterion Collection.  Many have demanded more Mexican films to be featured in the collection and ""Cronos"" was a wise decision.  Definitely recommended!",1292284800,8,13743,4.725671140939597
605333,5,6303233600,"I've heard a lot about Cronos through friends, and it's been on my Amazon Wishlist for sometime.  I never got around to buying it, and when I saw the Criterion Collection version available, I knew it was time.

Cronos is a fantastic grim fairytale (not grimms) with all the dark realism true to the fable genre.  Del Toro's style, though not as obvious as in his later movies, is still prevelant.  He blends alchemy, vampirism and modern horror seamlessly.  The makeup effects aren't anywhere as good as you see in today's Del Toro film's, but the imagery is there.  I think Cronos fits right in with movies like 'City of Lost Children' and 'Brazil'.  Not so much for the content, but for the dark yet rich visuals and the unique strangeness and brilliance of it that makes the movie a gem.

  Like Pan's Labyrinth, the strength and courage only a child is capable of is perfectly portrayed through a young girl who watches her grandfather unveil almost all of man's weaknesses as he is seduced by immortality and ultimately blood lust.  Without the young girl, Aurora, I'm not sure the film would of had so much emotional resonance.  Her acting isn't as great as the young lady in Pan's Labyrinth, but Aurora's silence is enough to make you empathize with her character and see that she has a deep personal connection with her grandpa.  She endures and absorbs so much throughout the story, and her undying love and affection for him proves the power and resilence of a child's spirit.  She always believed in him, even when she knew their was something deeply flawed about him.

I'm not sure all that was the point of the film, but I was so touched by the relationship between Aurora and Jesus Gris her grandfather.  Ron Pearlman is always great; he's such an underrated actor.  I love his character in Cronos, and his relationship with his uncle is a powerfully dark contrast to Aurora's and Jesus's.  I think if you want to watch Pearlman's magic without the Hellboy costume, you need to see him as the quirky loose-cannon Angel La Guardia.  Great acting all around.

It's not a gorey or graphic film.  It's a touching and thoughtful movie that strangely enough uses alchemy and vampirism without neccesarily fitting into the horror genre.  I think this is where I mention it's in english and spanish with subtitles.  It includes voice-over options for those opposed to reading.

The special features are extensive and worth it:

If you're into artfully styled magical fairy-like tales with grit--ala Jeunet, Jodorowsky, Coppola or Besson--then you'll love this movie. It's actually my favorite Del Toro film. It is extremely intelligent in plot, beautiful to gaze at, and lyrical in dialogue. It's very mature and well rounded as a story, and the characters make it seem epic.

I purchased the original release based off the actors and at the time, I heard good things about Guillermo del Toro but I watched it once and said to myself, why is this being praised? I keep a DVD case for movies I buy that are just plain bad and this went into it the same day I watched it. I didn't ""hate it"" - 1 star but come on. This is in no way anything more than a 2 star movie. It doesn't even have that appeal of movies like Phantasm which although are old and campy, are better than this. Maybe I'll watch it again and see if I missed something but I remember through the whole movie thinking to myself how I wasted $$. Look up trailers and vids of this before buying. I like Blue movies and obscure stuff but this was in no way worth the $$.
2nd viewing:
I watched it yet again and found it still unentertaining and mediocre. It just doesn't live up to the hype of a full price, criterion collection movie.
The only thing I found entertaining is the behind the scenes where the director states that he had to do so much in the movie from scratch and that he was so young when he made it. He also showed miniscule details to the viewer in a behind the scenes that you can't see in the movie. If I can't see these details in the movie then why was so much effort put into the detail in the designs and why am I watching it if I can't see it?",1291593600,7,1400,3.98576512455516
605366,5,6303233600,"The Criterion Collection has released a handsome, restored, hi-def edition of CRONOS (1993), director Guillermo del Toro's first feature film.

Shot mostly in Spanish, but partially in English (because co-star Ron Perlman did not speak Spanish), del Toro's screenplay offers an unusual take on the vampire movie.

In 1535, an alchemist builds a fantastic mechanism that can give its user eternal life and houses it in a palm-sized golden capsule.  The only problem is that, whoever uses this device becomes a vampire.

A building collapse puts a stake through the alchemist's heart in 1935, but the device is nowhere to be found until it turns up almost 60 years later in a Mexican antique shop owned by kindly Federico Luppi, who lives with his wife (Margarita Isabel) and granddaughter (Tamara Shanath).

Not realizing what he has discovered, Luppi accidentally triggers the device and is infected with the blood-sucking malady.
But, that's not his only problem.  It seems that the brutish Perlman has been sent to retrieve the device to help save his wealthy, dying uncle (Claudio Brook), and he will stop at nothing to get it...even murder.

CRONOS is an intriguing, visually rich fantasy.  For writer-director del Toro, it is a splendid preview of things to come.
As the tragic, reluctant vampire, Luppi delivers a heart-wrenching performance, and Perlman is marvelously over-the-top as Brook's nephew and ""hatchet man"".

Among the extras ion the DVD are two audio commentaries, one by del Torro and another by the film's producers, interviews with del Toro, Luppi, Perlman and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, a video tour of del Torro's home office and GEOMETRIA, an unreleased short horror film that del Toro started in 1987 and finished in 2010.

Antique dealer Jes&uacute;s Gris (Federico Luppi) is handling an angel statue when he finds an insectile metal object in the bottom. And it bites him, injecting him with a strange fluid. Soon Jes&uacute;s finds himself addicted to the device, and he finds that it's slowly restoring his youth and strength. And during a party, he also finds that it's giving him a hunger for blood.

Unfortunately, a wealthy but dying businessman is determined to find the device, and he sends out his brutal nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to find it -- and Angel even kills Jes&uacute;s when the old man doesn't tell him what he wants to know.

But expect lots of del Toro trademarks -- mysterious golden items, insects, weird and grotesque vampirism, religious symbolism, and favored actors Luppi and Perlman.

The entire movie is beautifully directed, and del Toro paints every scene with shadows, gold and blood. And rather than going for over-the-top spookery, del Toro mingles vampiric horror (Jesus staring hungrily at his granddaughter) with more visceral psychological horror (Jes&uacute;s returns to life with his mouth stitched shut). Even the gross-outs are subtle, like when we see that even Jes&uacute;s' flesh is turning white and larvalike.

Federico Luppi is absolutely brilliant as Jes&uacute;s -- he starts off as a genial, kindly old man with a love of antiques, but slowly he's eaten away by his lust for blood and addiction to the device.

The film rattles along the corridors of boring because you can care less for the storyline and its premise. I agree that the acting and character devolopmennt is well directed and blocked well by Guillermos detailed direction but it lingers on boredom. Back in the 90's after I had seen Cronos I had the rare prevliage of meeting Guillermo at his film workshop in Guadalajara Mexico just before the kidnapping of his father leading to his imigrating to the U.S. in 1999. Back then he was full of ideas and imagination , a true delight in fancy. A friend was interviewing him for a local magazine and I was doing the stock photos for that interview. After everything was said I pointed out that the film 's ending was vague and confusing. I understand that it is a vamire film but there is begining , middle and ending, as all scripts have and he answered ""well I only had a Million Dollars to work with and an American actor-I had to do the best of what I had"" I have to admit he has a great memory on horror and its monsters, but a storyline that intrest the audience must have intresting characters.

The work that went into this film is amazing, especially the creation of the Cronos device. Instead of babeling on about how good the film is, I'll just say that this is a movie worth watching.",1220832000,2,565,4.330188679245283
605416,4,6303233600,"In my opinion, great movies can either break the standards or take them to higher new levels, some masterpieces can do both. This movie, along with ""Near dark"", is a standard breaker, no doubt about it. The rest depends on what's your cup of tea, but if great thrillers are yours, this may interest you.

After classic gems like the mentioned Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near dark"" and other ""vampire"" films that offered a completely different view, description, and perspective about this mythology in horror films, Guillermo del Toro made his major 1993 breakthrought in both mexican and international film industry with this aclaimed and awarded tale about the search for inmortality. The tools, the means, the moods and the atmosphere used by Del Toro in this film were highly original and unespected for this kind of genre.

The theory of vampirism is focused on a technological device, an ancient artifact like a golden mechanical beetle that contains an inmortal parasite insect that will grant inmortal life to the one that feeds it with blood. So, what we have here is the story of the host for this ""Cronos"" device, antique dealer Jesus Gris (federico Lupi), who found this artifact inside an old 16th century statue, and his grand daughter Aurora (Tamara Shamath).

The evolution of the tale is very interesting, not horrific or macabre, but insightful and in some ways disturbing. Jesus Gris eventualy discovers the price to pay for this miracle artifact, wich is being transformed in a blood sucking human parasite. The aversion to daylight and the agonizing thirst for human blood unchain the instincts of survival and moral struggle proper of the ""innocent"" victims of vampirism. The adittion of a cruel villan portrayed as a dying millionaire looking for the precious device, and his violent thug nephew Angel (Ron Pearlman)as the man in charge to obtain it no matter what, are the final complement to such deep and tense tale. Aurora is the innocent silent witness of the transformation of his grandfather, and a backup character in order to maintain Jesus's humanity over the film.

Guillermo del Toro frequently uses this character formula in his original spanish-production films, like the following ""The devil's backbone"" and his latest masterpiece in drama and fantasy ""Pan's labyrinth"". Simple and very straight-forward, the movie flows to a climax i won't reveal, of course, and delivers a great fresh new reference for the genre with very low budget but high levels of artistic quality. Dark, gothic and surrealistic, this movie tracends the psychological thriller standard right into the horror standards, thanks to a less scary, non gory, but sensitive tale in a more human level.

The Inmortality issue in this movie, is like the ""sunlight"" issue on ""Near Dark"". The story is about the same: The victim is infected, descents to the lowest levels of indignity and basic desires, the moral battle over the lost humanity, and the final rise from hell to protect the loved ones. What more classic than that?

Highly recomended for sensitive fans, the ones looking for something new, different and in a way, exciting for the horror genre. A little history lesson if you think about it.

Just not recomended for extreme gore and shocking horror fans, this is way too dramatic and could be boring compared to these choices. To each is own, but everybody is welcome anyway.

The DVD edition? Nah! Just standard and regular as it can be for 90% of these movies. Look for it and enjoy the choice of edition you want, it's all good.",1205452800,4,3540,4.967905405405405
605417,3,6303233600,"Guillermo del Toro's first feature film Cronos places a new spin on the familiar vampire genre. The film touches on what it means to be human and on man's quest for eternal life. Immortality is presented to Jesus Gris (Frederico Luppi) through the Cronos device. This device created by a 16th Century alchemist promises eternal life albeit at quite a price.

The film which one numerous awards is quite good with excellent attention paid to details. The supporting cast includes Claudio Brooks as a dying industrialist and Ron Perlman as his henchman nephew Angel.

The film is filled with cinematic in jokes and also contains quite a bit of Mexican and religious symbology. In his first film del Toro tackles many of the subjects that run throughout his later more mature works. While not as powerful as his efforts in Pan's Labyrinth this is a film that is well worth seeing even if it is somewhat expensive and difficult to find.

605418,3,6303233600,"Guillermo del Toro made a splash in 1993 with ""Cronos,"" which he directed at the tender age of 29.  Perhaps if I could go back to 1993 and see this movie for the first time, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, I didn't see this movie until 2008 and after I'd seen del Toro's recent masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth.""  I gave ""PL"" five stars, and I just can't put ""Cronos"" in the same league.

Essentially a thoughtful, religious vampire story, ""Cronos"" tells the tale of an elderly antiques dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi), who innocently discovers the ""Cronos device.""  This machine, a beetle-like contraption made out of gold and with a nasty bug lurking in its wheels, was the creation of a 14th-century alchemist.  As Senor Gris learns, the bite of the device imparts immortality, but at a gruesome price.  Only the love of his granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath), provides Senor Gris with the strength and salvation he needs and deserves.

""Cronos"" clearly proves that del Toro is a filmmaker to be reckoned with, and the movie deserves its cult status.  If you're looking for a solid horror film that creates legitimate tension but never settles for the ""jump-out-from-just-outside-the-frame"" gimmicks, you could do much, much worse.  But despite the solid comic performance of Ron Perlman as a frustrated strong-arm man, one cannot say that ""Cronos"" is del Toro's best work.  He has made better movies since then, and he will continue to do so. But virtually every filmmaker in the world wishes he could have cranked out ""Cronos"" right out of the gate.",1200787200,4,1563,4.931297709923665

Unfortunately, immortality does not come cheap (does it ever?) and the price is that the old man must stay away from sunlight and drink human blood.

As is blatantly obvious from the above synopsis, ""Cronos"" is a novel spin on the classic vampire story. The storyline has a lot of potential, but unfortunately, that potential is never realized. Instead, the audience is forced to suffer through a dreary, slowmoving story, where little happens and with an ending so abrupt that I found myself exclaiming aloud ""that's it?"" as the credit started to roll.

This version focuses on the Cronos device, a gadget that looks like a cross between a Faberge egg and a scorpion. Created by an alchemist five hundred years ago, it falls into the hands of Jesus, an antique dealer. Much of the plot deals with Jesus and his wealthy adversary Dieter de la Guardia, who, because he is dying, wants the device for himself. He browbeats his son Angel (Ron Perlman) into procuring archangel statues - the object that originally concealed the ancient mechanism - from all over the world. Jesus manages to hide the device before Angel can find it.

Unfortunately, while examing his discovery, Jesus unwittingly activates it. While the Cronos device brings everlasting life (barring the traditional heart impalement), it comes at an even worse price than usual. No suave Bela Lugosi types in this movie!

There are some flaws in the story. Little is made of the device's rejeuvenating effects - the descent to vampirism begins almost immediately, weakening the sense of a Faustian bargain. Though much is made of an instructional tome, Jesus and the inventor seemed to have suffered equally from the device, even though we assume the latter used it 'properly'.

The pacing and tone, though, are strong, and the relationship between Jesus and his daughter Aurora (the central bond in the film) is well-developed and sympathetic. The special effects are simple, but work well to help the narrative along. It's an interesting first effort, well worth checking out if you're curious about the director's early work.

It's a fine movie with a unique story that gives you something to think about.  The actors and actresses were very well used in the movie.  Ron Perlman was perfect as a thug doing the dirty work for his uncle.  All of the locations in Spain were very well utilized by the director.  I know some people were complaining about Jesus' granddaughter not saying a word throughout the whole movie.  I believe her character was used as a reflection of sympathy and love for her grandfather.  It was nice to see a movie taking a new approach on the Vampire mythology.  Be sure to watch the special features on director Guillermo del Torro.  He talks about the inscription on the Cronos device and it is a work of art.

Once more the force of the myth reappears, yesterday Faust, then Dorian Gray 's portrait and now Cronos recreates the archetypical desire: the triviality conceived as the absence of physical tensions and the required attention to assume the cost of the daring.

The vehement desire of the human race legitimated from the own Greek roots, to enthrone  us in Gods nature and taste the fruits of the eternity, is the essential key stone of the Greek tragedy: the transgression of the rule and the attempt for cross the forbidden line imposed by Ex machine Deities may be considered for many people as an affront and to others as a reaffirmation of this famous statement: ""The man is the measure of all the things."", reinserted in Goethe 's Faust: ""I only love those who pretend the impossible.""",1127433600,2,1114,4.847368421052631
605458,5,6303233600,"`Cronos', written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, his first film, is a really delightful find, similar to many other surprising little movies such as `La Femme Nikita', `The 13th Warrior', `Mad Max' and going back a ways, `The Hustler'.

One very important warning is that this is NOT the relatively poor sci-fi B movie of a few decades back, with a spelling, I believe, of `Kronos' and a plot vaguely suggesting world domination by computers.

The most amazing thing about this movie is that it gives AT LEAST two new twists to the old vampire story, if you interpret the vampire legend in its broadest terms. The first twist is the notion that vampirism can be induced by the inoculation of blood from an essentially immortal insect, with the assistance of a clockwork mechanism created by a very talented alchemist in Spain at the time of the Inquisition. The second major twist is the notion that a person, once infected with vampirism and benefiting from it's gift of long life, will want to be free of this `gift' and die for good.

Many of the other twists in this plot are somewhat predictable, except that they are implemented in a truly creative way. The story is realized in such a subtle manner that the level of graphic horror is so low, one wonders at how it deserved its R rating. On the other hand, I will give credit to the review board for appreciating the subtlety of the dread in many of the movie's situations.

One of the most effective cards played by this story is the `little girl in peril' card, so vividly done up in the movie `Aliens'. To the credit of Del Toro and company, he does not go as far as James Cameron does, but just far enough to have the gambit do its thing.

One of the very best things about this DVD is its subtitling in English and its director's commentary in English. I will give you the warning now that you should watch the whole movie through first with the original soundtrack before rewatching it with Del Toro's talkover. I was especially surprised to find such quality subtitling in a low budget movie. The English subtitles seem to be done not only for the benefit of someone who does not understand Spanish, but also for a hearing impaired viewer, as the subtitles include notes on background sounds and indications on when the lines are being sung rather than just being spoken.

This low budget movie realization is so good, one is not surprised that Del Toro does such a good job on big budget efforts such as `Hellboy' and `Blade 2'. The writing is so good, one wonders why, however, he takes on projects based on other people's material. The Spanish-speaking actors are unknown to me, but they do an excellent job, as does Ron Perlman whose dialogue, thankfully, is all in English. I say that not because I have any doubt that Perlman can't come across in Spanish, but as a thoroughly American actor, he is much more believable in English.

The other extras are pretty predictable. Note that while the credits give two commentary tracks, the track spoken by the producer is all in Spanish, which did me little good.

If you have a taste for good horror, this movie is not to be missed!",1123459200,10,3151,4.564601769911504
605459,1,6303233600,"I love del Toro's movies, but this was a major disappointment. Apart from a few nice visuals, this film has no redeeming quality. Every scene is predictable, badly acted, badly filmed, and not even remotely scary.

Furthermore, this movie features possibly the worst child actor in history of the world cinema. I'd imagine that a young girl (5? 6?) who's just seen her grandpa come back from the dead looking like a corpse would be freaking out, or show at least SOME sort of emotion. This child's face and body language were only a tad more alive than a plastic manequin, including the scene where she splits a man's skull open with a walking stick. For me, that drove the final nail into the coffin of this movie.

Skip this one, and see The Devil's Backbone instead.",1117065600,7,769,4.605839416058394
605460,4,6303233600,"For some reason I developed an early low opinion of Mexican horror films and have since avoided them.  Fortunately I didn't realize Cronos was Mexican ans so got to see this truly unusual film directed by Guilliermo del Toro.  While it will never win a place on the heights there's a surprising amount of inventiveness and imaginative film work in something that probably has one-tenth the budget of the average Hollywood failure.

Imagine, if you will that a European alchemist fled Europe to Mexico in the 16th Century.  Gaining appointment as the Governor's clockmaker he set about making a machine that would prolong his life.  He succeeds and lives until a building collapses on him in modern times.  His estate is broken up and sold and the real story begins when an antique dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi), acquires a statue of an angel.  In it he finds a golden scarab-like machine.  One with horrific powers that Jesus inadvertently activates.

Seeking the scarab for his own purposes is Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) and his last remaining relative Angel (Ron Perlman).  They will stop at nothing, but a repeatedly foiled by the scarab's power over Jesus.  Another key player is Aurora Gris (Tamara Shanath) who has no lines but seems to preside over the life and death drama that plays out before her.

There are a few grim and violent moments, but, for the most part, Cronos gains its momentum from its atmospherics.  Imagine a screenplay written by Poe and directed by Fellini with echoes of Don't Look Now and you will have a sense of the film's feeling.  Colors are dark, sets are detailed, and the minimal special effects are telling.  Especially the insides and operation of the clockwork scarab.

The film is as much about the value of life as it is a horror or suspense story.  Clumsy at some times and subtle at others, the message gets through with an ending which leaves just enough in question to haunt the viewer.  The approach is novel, a very different twist on the vampire genre, and I found myself liking it more the longer I watched it.  Definitely worth viewing.",1112140800,77,2103,4.759668508287293

I don't have the energy to go over the same territory covered in so many reviews here. Suffice it to say that we found the movie to be slooooow. We kept waiting for the energy to ratchet up a few notches but were consistently disappointed.

The movie is not bad. It's simply not as good, in our eyes, as the effusive praise of the many reviewers suggests. I believe it's a cultural difference. I mean, the movie won the Best Picture back in 1993 in Mexico and won Best Film at Cannes so somebody likes the languid pace of this movie. But it fails on most counts for me.

In a word: boring. But with many, many ideas that could be dealt with better (for me) by an American writer and director.",1111104000,3,805,4.2894736842105265

The story is not bad: 400 years ago an alchemist figures a way to cheat death by creating a device (cronos) with a little cookarocha in it among other mechanisms. A weathy (and dying) De La Guardia seeks the device after obtaining a manuscript with precise instructions on how to use it. It's another twist on the vampire theme.

605463,5,6303233600,"A new vision of the vampire myth involving an insect trapped in a device that grants immortality (with a price of course), an innocent grandfather, his all but silent granddaughter, a human monster and his victimized nephew.

An elderly antiques shop owner, Jesus Gris, and his granddaughter, Aurora, discover an unusually device in a four hundred year old Archangel statue.  Gris inadvertently triggers the device which begins a change in him that not only slowly makes him more youthful in look and energy but infects him with an addict's consuming fixation for blood.  Unfortunately for Gris, he is not the only one with knowledge of the device's existence and power, and he becomes the target of the dying businessman De La Guardia's desire for immortality at any cost and his violent nephew Angel.

Loved this film!  Loved it!  I've always had a thing for vampires and I really enjoyed this new view of the vampire mythology.  This isn't just a new story of vampirism though, it is also a tale of family.  The love, devotion, and acceptance of family is beautifully shown through the grandfather Jesus and granddaughter Aurora, as is the dark side of family, with it's violence, abuse and victimization, as shown through the obsessed De La Guardia and his nephew Angel.

Ron Perlman is absolutely superb as Angel.  He takes what could have been the average brute/thug character and gives him humor, depth, and the ability to evoke sympathy and, almost, forgiveness, from the audience. If you want to introduce a friend to Ron Perlman's work, consider doing so with this performance.

Frederico Luppi and the late Claudio Brooks are also entrancing in their performances as Jesus Gris and De La Guardia, respectively.

Favorite line (narration describing the death of the cronos device creator): ""His skin was the color of marble in moonlight.""

The DVD extras and commentary are wonderfully enjoyable in and of themselves (how they shot the interior of the cronos device and what happened to it later...eeeewwww, that the thirteen cronos devices used in the film were stolen on the last day of the shoot, that Ron Perlman did accidentally connect, fist to face, at one point with Frederico Luppi, etc).

605515,4,6303233600,"Guillermo Del Toro's modern Grimm's Fairy Tale ""Cronos"" focuses as much on character as it does horror. In many respects, it's a throw back to the horror comic books or movies he watched as a kid updated. Antiques dealer Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) gets more than he bargains for when he covers a ornate gold ""beetle"" at the base of a decorative angel. He and his devoted granddaughter and wife discover the promise of immortality but also the horrible price one must pay when given a ""gift"" such as this.

Rich industrialist Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) has his brutish nephew Angel (Ron Perlman)searching for the device himself. Only Dieter knows about the history of the device, what it can do and the consquences of using it. When Jesus resists Dieter's offer for the device, it also puts his family in peril.

A rich, allegorical horror film that recalls the classic films of the 30's and 40's with its focus on character and the consquences of their actions at the expense of endless blood and gore, ""Cronos"" is a thoughtful, sad movie that demonstrated the considerable talents of Del Toro (""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Blade II"", ""Hellboy""). It's got its moments of gross out gore but Del Toro focuses his story on the delicate relationship between Jesus, his wife and granddaughter.

The film is presented with the original Spanish voiceover presented in English. After that, the film is a mix of Spanish and English as Dieter and Angel speak both sparingly throughout the film while Jesus and his family speak nothing but English. It would probably help to have on the subtitles if you don't speak English during the film as it switches back and forth pretty consistently.

The presentation and look of the DVD is very good capturing the nice textures and colors of the original film although it can't hold a candle to the high definition transfer of ""The Devil's Backbone"" that recently came out on DVD. Extras include an interview with Del Toro with clips from his very first short films made when he was a teenager up to and including his first 16mm production. There's also an interview with behind-the-scenes footage of Federico Luppi (a thoughtful and talented actor)from the production. There's also an Easter Egg included as well. Look for the Lion's Gate logo and click on it for a nice little surprise. We get a photo gallery and commentaries from both Del Toro and the film's producer. Del Toro's commentary is in English while the producer's commentary is in Spanish.

A haunting, atmospheric debut from Del Toro that deserves to be seen. It's not exactly a horror film (and why Del Toro is referred to as a horror film director is beyond me), it's more of a fantasy/suspense story with horror themes.",1096156800,50,2727,4.818376068376068

five stars for a very interesting and intriguing independent film. Now my complain:
Lions Gate got the rights for the distribution Cronos...but I don't believe that they also got the rights for editing and dubbing the introduction of the film. For those of you that aren't familiar with this flick, this is a Mexican film, there after the original language is spanish. The original movie started with a beautiful monologue in spanish that introduced an old enigmatic and important character. Like I said...the original monologue was in spanish, and now has been dubbed in english!!! then as the monologue finishes, the movie continues in its original spanish language. Can somebody explain me why??? This is completely insulting!!!!
This is my only complaint for the Dvd and the movie.
I won't write a review because everybody else have so it would be repetitive....but this movie is a must see for anymore interested in intelligent, visualistic and thought-provoking horror with unique and diferent twists in the Vampirism genre!",1073260800,12,1045,5.226190476190476

The script is brilliant, inteligent, and the characters are like normal people, they aren't stereotypes(something very intelligent and brave)the gag of perlman wanting to fix his nose its an example of that, that helps the movie a lot to achieve that scary mood.
What is better is that Guillermo dignifies the horror genre, he gives also a quality to the film, that even the so called intellectual people must accept that this is a great movie.
The movie moves forward thanks to the story, and uses sfx only when is needed, doesnt need to rely on sfx to be scary, like many recent horror pictures,that cant even do that.
The movie is full of metaphores, and retoric forms for those who like the stylish movies, actually most of the images are poems in themselves.
To finish, if you are a adult with a young spirit you would like it, and if you are a so called intellectual or sofisticated person you would like it as well.

605518,5,6303233600,"When I first watch Cronos, I was sitting in my comfortable chair placed exactly in front of my TV set surrounded by that security feeling only my house can bring me. That feeling disappeared soon. I couldn't believe what I was being witness of.
I'll have to tell you the context I was in when I watched it, for you to understand. I'm Mexican. When I watched this movie I was 15 yrs. old and the Mexican movie ""industry"" (if you can call it that way) hadn't a reputation for its excellent horror movies.
Cronos is a movie that was released back in a time in which mexican movies were usually flops because of the lack of support from producers, distributors and audiences alike. The movie was released in 10 movie theaters only and only in Mexico City and it was retired because movie owners considered it a failure!!! (How couldn't it be a failure with only 10 theaters showing it? Hello?)
When the movie went to Cannes and won the Critics Week Award, this event didn't change a lot the movie's fortune. I, being an avid film fan and being from a small town called Coatzacoalcos (I dare you to spell it right!)and having read a lot from it in magazines and newspapers had to wait until it's release on VHS to rent it.
It instantly became one of my all time favorites.
You have to understand... Our mexican HORROR movies were of the likes of Ed Wood movies, until Cronos arrived. Ok, I have to admit that there were three other HORROR movies on the seventies (""Even the Wind is Frightened"", ""The Stone Book"" and ""As Black as Night"" all from the same director, named Carlos Enrique Taboada), but if you watch them today they have lost their FRIGHT FACTOR.
So in a Mexico with a lot of legends and folklore, the complete abssence of HOORROR movies was a curse broken by Guillermo Del Toro a young, fat man from Guadalajara that was an avid comic reader and makeup artist.
If you could read the script (which you can buy here in Mexico), you could read the pretty images that become poetic and that Guillermo handles in a way no one else can.
Poetry and horror mixed? It may sound odd, but it works...
There's a part in which the lead character looks his reflection in the mirror and asks: How do I look? And the writer (Del Toro) answers him:
Horribly.
A great literary scene that you can only appreciate by reading it and then watching the movie again. I swear you can almost hear the writer answering him on film!
The story follows the life of a Jess Gris (Translated as Gray Jesus... nice game of words, ain't it?) and his discovering of an odd goldlike aparatus. How will it affect his life? Will it bring joy or misfortune? That is for you to find out.
Now... Let me explain something... A lot of people know Del Toro for movies like ""Mimic"" and ""Blade"", which I think he directed brilliantly, and I read that an Amazon client complained because on the DVD case of ""The Devil's Backbone"" (Another Guillermo Del Toro's preciosist film, just number two after Cronos of course, in my list of his movies)there's written:
""Vastly more stylish and frightening than ""The Others""""
So, he bought it and was dissapointed, because the movie didn't frighten him as much as ""The Others"" did!!!
Let me say this:
The HORROR genre is not necessarily a genre that will frighten you. You mean HORROR when a film has something, anything involving the paranormal... So, under this parameter, Ghost is a HORROR film. It doesn't scare you but its main premise touches the paranormal aspect. Get it?
So... All this being said...
Buy it! Sit back! And Enjoy!

605519,4,6303233600,"Before Guillermo del Toro came to Hollywood to make big budget thrillers such as Mimic and Blade II, he was in Mexico making movies that are truly unique and filled with tension. His directorial debut, Cronos, is a hugely original movie and take on the vampire theme. Guillermo also wrote the screenplay.
The movie opens up with a narrator telling the story of an alchemist who made a metallic, beetle like device (the Cronos) that when placed against skin, has a scorpion like stinger that stabs the person and injects a tiny amount of bloody fluid. The injections cause the alchemist to live for centuries and only dies when he is in line at a bank in Vera Cruz during an earthquake and is crushed by falling debris.
Some time later, an antique dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi), discovers the Cronos device in the base of an old statue he has acquired. After wondering what the device might be for, he inadvertently sets it off and is pricked by it's stinger. The whole process of watching this happen is fascinating, and you are never quite sure if there is some sort of living insect inside the enclosure, thanks to Guillermo's David Lynch like photography and editing of the scene.
Jesus soon discovers that he has more energy and feels more youthful than he has in ages. But unbeknownst to him, there is an evil and rich old man, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) who has been searching for years for the device. He has tracked it down to Jesus' shop and sends his simple minded nephew, Angel de la Guardia (brilliantly portrayed by Ron Perlman), to get the statue that has stored in it, the Cronos device. When the statue turns up empty, Dieter instructs Angel to get the device at any cost.
In the meantime, Jesus has become addicted to using the device. His young granddaughter has noticed him using it and decides for his own good to hide it from him. After spending time with her he realizes that maybe the sacrifices of the device, such as his wife not feeling as youthful as him, or his greedy and manic need to posses and have control of the device, are not worth the benefits.
The story is not fast paced by any means, but the development of the characters is superb. There are also slow moving scenes with huge amounts of tension, in particular a scene where Jesus is at a party where someone had cut himself and cleaned up in the bathroom. Jesus finds himself drawn to the blood that had dripped on the floor and after slowly considering it and getting his face closer to it, he has his cheek against the floor and extends his tongue and licks up the drops!
I have seen the video a couple times, but it is on DVD in region 2 PAL format only. The video is available in both subtitled and dubbed versions. I highly recalled the subtitles, because much of the dialogue is already in English. Ron Perlmans' character for example does not speak almost any Spanish.
Perhaps now that Guillrmo del Toro is more well known in the US, we will get a region 1 NTSC release on dvd.",1034380800,17,2991,4.5

I got right online and checked for a subtitled version and here it is. I find that movies don't usually survive re-dubbing intact and are often made into ridiculous mockeries of their former selves. Watch just about ANY japenese film to see what I mean.
So, I have given it a 3 in the hope that it was the dialogue at fault here and not the film as a whole. Given that I have thoroughly enjoyed the director's other horror efforts (Blade II and Mimic), I think that this movie is probably alot better than I am given the chance to see.
I will STRONGLY recommend that you make sure to get the subtitled version of this film so that you can hear the dialogue properly delivered with the intended emotion conveyed. Watch for the ASIN to be sure you have the correct version. The subtitled VHS ASIN is 6303233635.",1032220800,,927,4.364161849710983
605521,3,6303233600,"This movie is well-filmed, well-written, has some excellent acting, and the interactions between the kindly antique dealer and his concerned granddaughter are very well done. However, it just does not work as a horror movie.  Chronos is actually more like an unrealistic anti-drug movie.
The Chronos device is a mechanical bug created by an alchemist in order to give himself immortality.  After he is killed in an accident, the device winds up in the possession of an antique dealer who becomes infected by it and as a result he becomes younger.  He also gets a slight craving for blood, but his morals prevent him from doing anything wrong in order to get blood.  Meanwhile, a mega-rich man with a Howard-Hughes style fear of germs sends Ron Perlman to obtain the Chronos device from the dealer.
Despite the physical changes to the antiques dealer, he never becomes a monster or kills anyone. The movie is mostly about him trying to deal with his new addiction.  Furthermore, Perlman could just as easily be after the antique dealer to collect drug money or a missing briefcase of drugs as he is after a device for immortality.  The movie barely even gets into the concepts of death or immortality (after all, nobody in the movie has lived beyond their normal lifespan).  Thus except for its setup, Chronos could have been just another movie about coccaine or heroin addiction.
With that in mind, it is a half-decent movie about addiction, but not good enough to deserve the awards it won from Cannes.  It is mostly just impressive for how good it looks for a cheap Mexican production.
The director, Guillermo del Toro has gone on to direct Blade II, so some people may be curious to see one of his older films, but don't be fooled: the two are NOTHING alike.",1010966400,2,1761,4.73202614379085
605522,4,6303233600,"This is without question one of the best vampire films of the 1990s, and definitely one of the most unusual vampire films of any time.  Directed by Mexican Guillermo del Torro (no relation to Benecio), it's set in Mexico City where artifacts are plentiful.  And in fact, the opening setting is an antique shop run by an older man, played well by Federico Luppi (he also starred in John Sayles' masterful Men With Guns).
Stumbling upon a bizarre thingamajig--the Cronos Device--he accidentally pricks himself with its ""legs"" (it resembles a huge golden beetle) that spring out from its squat body and plunge into the palm of his hand.  Eventually, he extricates the thing, but it's difficult.  Realizing this is no ordinary item, he wraps it up and takes it home, accompanied all this time by his granddaughter, to whom he's devoted.
The effect of the device, as it happens, is addictive.  And, as they say, therein lies the rub.  The sole non-Hispanic actor in the film, Ron Perlman, does a great job of portraying the crude, nasty nephew of a wealthy man as old as the antique dealer who must have this device no matter what the cost.
The transformation of the antique dealer is much more fascinating than frightening.  Del Torro captures perfectly the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle moods induced by the man's strange metamorphosis; his behavior follows these physical changes so closely that the sequence of events seems all too plausible.
The ending is truly bizarre, one of the most compelling images ever seen in a vampire film.  The plot, pacing, script, and performances lift this well above the run-of-the-mill horror flick.  Rather than spend money on tripe like Scream or Who Cares What You Did Last Summer?, take a look at this one.
