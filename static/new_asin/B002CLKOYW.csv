3906383,4,B002CLKOYW,"Like their earlier, even better 'L'Iceberg', this is an inventive throwback to silent films and physical comedies, directed, written and chiefly
performed by a talented trio of circus trained clowns.

It's complete with their trademark minimal dialogue and dark events that never keep the film from being light and funny.  For example, near the start of the film, the two main characters are in a car crash; one loses a leg, the other his memory, but somehow it works being played for laughs.

As a whole, this didn't work quite as well as their 'L'Iceberg' for me - that had a more interesting, surreal plot to hang their routines on, and
more of their bits rose to the level of truly inspired, but this is still a sweet, funny, good-hearted film that cheerfully refuses to play by modern rules.",1295568000,,796,4.712230215827338

I enjoyed it so much that I decide to own it.",1288828800,,82,3.823529411764706
3906385,1,B002CLKOYW,"Disappointed
I bought the DVD Rumba because I enjoyed enormously the gags shown in an advertising short cut movie presentation. Taken independently the jokes are very good:
* A lesson of English to French speaking kids
* The end of the school
* A man trying to commit suicide by being hit by a vehicle
* Abel and Gordon entirely destroyed home by a fire leaving them without shelter under heavy rain
* Flowers sent to the sea and immediatly coming back by Gordon to commemorate Abel drowning.
The movie was becoming more and more boring: the mere addition of all theses gags does not make a 77 minutes movie.
The couple, Gordon and Abel, certainly enjoy their job but in anyway they cannot be compared to Jacques Tati, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Marx Brothers.",1261267200,,768,4.654411764705882
3906386,4,B002CLKOYW,"I picked up this movie not knowing what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most creative movies I have seen in recent times. It takes slapstick comedy (if you can call it that - I call it art!) to a whole new level. True - it is at-times surreal but the two actors (and the director) handle emotions so well, that even without much dialogue they succeed in keeping you hooked for the entire movie. The director does a fine job weaving the tale around situations that take some real absurd turns (for eg: the flaming fake leg scene). And yet... in the end it does not feel over-done. What keeps you going is not only the quirk characters but also the fine creative way of story-telling, in my opinion.

In terms of creativity, this movie was definitely off-the-charts and for that alone, this deserves at least 4 stars and gets a must-see recommendation from me. (Must add: Definitely not a movie for people that are used to standard fare that Hollywood churns out though.)",1260835200,8,979,4.4692737430167595

8364206,5,B002CLKOYW,"The most exciting thing that has happened to me this summer is having discovered Fiona Gordon and Dom Abel.  They are both amazing artists/comedians and have created a formula for slapstick that cannot be topped!  I love these two together.  I am writing reviews on all three of their movies to help boost them to a 5 star rating.  The story, choreography, setting, all elements in movie making are simply amazing!",1406246400,,414,4.788732394366197
8364207,5,B002CLKOYW,"My wife and I saw this movie in the theater and we both loved it's simple, but totally entertaining story. The actors are simply fantastic! There are four or five dance scenes and they come from out of the blue, yet fit in perfectly. No dialogue, really, but none is needed. Since buying the dvd, we've watched it with our 1 and 3 year old and they were in love with the vibrant colors and movements. We watched it with my in-laws too and they agreed that it was a fresh, funny take on a very sweet love story. Not mushy, just romantic and very funny, while being serious. Life deals the two main characters a tough blow, but it does absolutely nothing to quench their joy of life! I simply can't say enough good things about this film and I think I'll watch it with my family this weekend.",1390867200,3,790,4.273333333333333
8364208,4,B002CLKOYW,"Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon are a great comedy team. If you appreciate Charlie Chaplin, Mr. Bean, and other visual comedic characters, you may love this couple. They are from the northern coast of France where they apparently live and produce their films. This is non-spoken humor that transcends all language barriers.",1381104000,2,323,5.230769230769231
