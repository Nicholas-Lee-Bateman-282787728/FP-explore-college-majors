8699741,4,B00SXNKGHS,"The cover art for this film is a little misleading because  it's neither a straight comedy or a randy bedroom farce.  The film concerns Marjorie (Nancy Kwan), a proper young English secretary who days before her nuptials and her last day of work deciding to do an image makeover for the office Christmas party.  Away with the frumpy look and in with the slinky dress and kinky boots.  The new look elicits a reaction from her co-workers and associates but Marjorie may have bitten off more than she can chew.  Far from a great film ""The Wild Affair"" is an interesting snapshot of life before women were emancipated in Britain and could easily be applicable to the United States at the time the film was made in 1964.  Consider if you're a bright young woman like Marjorie at this time your choices as a single girl are either office worker or concubine.  By choosing marriage Marjorie pretty much limits her possibilities before reaching the age of twenty-one. As for Kwan's performance it all depends on whether you accept her as an Anglo-Saxon working girl or not.  Nice bits by some recognizable faces that include Terry-Thomas, Victor Spinetti (""A Hard Day's Night""), and Frank Thornton (""Are You Being Served?"").  A minor film not without its merits.",1431820800,2,1255,4.8
