6673048,4,B00NMV887G,An Extremely crazy  look at existentialism through the eyes of a loser and the talking mold growing in his bathroom.  The one and only Jeffery Combs voices the Mold.  This is movie is definitely a game changer.,1411171200,3,210,4.621621621621622
6673049,5,B00NMV887G,"The mold abides. Motivational Growth is a very original, creative, funny and disturbing movie. An intelligent fast paced film but don't be underwhelmed. It stays in Ian's fascinating dingy apartment and he never leaves so neither does the camera. His mind is gone when we first meet him but he isn't fully untethered, yet. The imagination, dialogue and 8 bit score are plenty enough for cinephiles to chew on. I mean all we really need is Kent the T.V. to be fulfilled. Great title with a great concept and executed almost perfectly. Jeffrey Combs as the voice of The Mold takes MG over the top for me. Watch this now! Or the mold will get you. Don't overthink this movie, just experience it. After all it does take place in Ian's head.

I love discovering movie gold. But I now know I really love dirty, disgusting, slimy and grimey movie mold too! I heart toxic waste! I'm out of here, going to go watch Motivational Growth once more because I'm on the way to Succesville. I might never leave my house and just ride the crazy train in a circle again and again.",1429833600,,1062,4.5025906735751295

6673065,4,B00NMV887G,"MOTIVATIONAL GROWTH is the story of Ian, a man who hasn't left his apartment in 16 months, spending most of his time watching Kent, the name he's given to his ancient, Commodore television set. When Kent finally blows a tube and dies, Ian decides to kill himself with chemicals in the bathroom, at which point he quite literally stumbles across a giant, talking pile of mold. The Mold (as it likes to be called) starts to act as Ian's life counselor, helping him turn his life around. Sort of. Let's just say that The Mold's intentions might not be of the purest strain.

There are a lot of things to like about the film. Adrian DiGiovanni does a near seamless job of portraying our resident loser, and cult-favorite Jeffery Combs is a treat as the voice of the mold. Writer/Director/Editor Don Thacker does an equally stellar job with his first feature film, stretching his meager, indie-budget into something that looks like it could've come out of one of the big name production companies. The editing, effects, and stylized cinematography have a loving finesse to them that is almost hypnotic. The film is set in the nineties, and things like audio cassettes and 8-bit video game graphics are prominent elements of the film's set. (We almost never leave Ian's apartment, except occasionally to dip into Kent's world of cheesy 90's TV shows.) Even the score has that charming, retro, 8-bit sound to it. So much about this film is a ton of fun.

This is good news, since it's not without its flaws. For one thing, in spite of its virtuoso weirdness, the script feels like it cribs heavily from both FIGHT CLUB and PULP FICTION, and in ways that are kind of to its detriment.

FIGHT CLUB: Depressed, loner character living a dead-end life finds solace in an unlikely tutor who may or may not have his best interests at heart. Also, there's a very real sense that things are not as they seem: our protagonist may not have a clear view of the full picture. Also, he frequently interrupts the action to directly address the audience, often with glib comments on what's happening, other times just to interject little factoids, like what kinds of household chemicals you can use to kill someone.

PULP FICTION: Every other character Ian interacts with speaks with the same hyper-verbal, polysyllabic speechifying that no one ever uses. Even as a stylistic choice, it gets old and numbing when it comes out of the mouths of everyone from the impossibly angelic girl next door to the muscly, bullheaded landlord. Let's also not forget the out-of-nowhere pop culture digressions that add nothing to the story other than to give it a self-aware hipness (e.g., arguing that all TV can be divided into Star Trek or Not-Star Trek).

The start of the movie is really effective -- you really get the sense that this guy has lost the will to live -- but as soon as he decides to kill himself, that's when he starts talking matter-of-factly to the camera, his delivery so lucid and self-possessed that his desire to die no longer rings true. It just feels like mugging and pandering, and all that's left is the fact that the film is so bizarre, and weird, and crazy to look at. Heck, even at one of the most violent and horrific moments in the plot, the script totally deflates the tension by having Ian give an overwrought, over-written speech about the nature of panic.

The story itself doesn't have a lot going for it other than the fact that it's nearly impossible to tell what's actually going on. Even the ending leaves it all a little vague, but not by much. It's pretty clear that -- however blurred the line is between reality, fantasy, life, afterlife, and just plain decay -- the film is operating on some level as a complex metaphorical lesson. That would actually make it seem pretentious if the predominant symbol wasn't a throbbing pile of talking mold. My point being that I usually don't care for films that so openly wear their iconography on their sleeves, or that sacrifice an actual story for the sake of teaching a lesson.

I liked this movie, though, and I'm eager to see the future work of both DiGiovanni and Thacker. In spite of Thacker's rookie mistakes with the script -- the cock-sure dialogue digressions foremost among them -- it's clear he's a man with a whole bathtub's worth of talent. If you don't mind confusion for confusion's sake, if you have a strong stomach (talking mold is the least gross thing in this film), and if you're cool with the loosey-goosey script sensibilities of a riffing-it Woody Allen, then you'll probably like this movie, too.",1414972800,11,4574,4.71
6673066,5,B00NMV887G,"Engrossing performances from both Digiovanni and Colmbs, a captivating script, and some damned good puppetry. Combine that with some very real horror, and an ambiguous enough ending to prompt the desire for multiple viewings and you have the kind of movie only the independent film scene could possibly deliver.

6673067,1,B00NMV887G,I guess the storyline is like the degradation and worthlessness of humankind. No better than slime. This movie was not funny at all to me. It was really a worthless attempt at a ridiculous plot. Save your money.,1414281600,3,211,4.578947368421052

8679233,1,B00NMV887G,"Not even the voice talent of Jeffery Combs (Re-Animator) can salvage this psychological horror comedy. An interesting premise with well animated 8bit sequences which might have worked better as a short. But at nearly 2 hours long, utterly tedious and nonsensical.",1472774400,,263,5.439024390243903
8679234,2,B00NMV887G,"Imagine a cross between Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Little Shop of Horrors, and Scott Pilgrim VS The World, but not as good as that sounds.
The Acting: The characters do the best that they can with the material that they have. Jeffrey Combs does an excellent job as The Mold, who sounds like a cross between a used car salesman, a circus ringleader, a chain smoking grifter, and the cool uncle who you wish that you had. But there are no other stand out performances because the actors are handicapped by the next point.
Dialogue: The screenwriter is either trying too hard to make quotable and memorable dialogue, or he is not trying nearly hard enough to make natural sounding unpretentious dialogue. All of the characters talk in this grandiose lyrical prose that no one would ever mistake for how a real person would talk. For example, the main character, Ian Foliver, describes defecating as ""Prim and proper metabolic maintenance"" and his love interest comes onto him by describing the mating habits of bees with no prompting. What makes matters worse is that there is so much dialogue, the characters spend more time talking about their situation then they spend visibly reacting to it. Ian constantly monologues about his situation directly to the camera, like Edward Norton does in Fight Club, to the point that this is written more like a stage play than it is a movie.
Production Design: The production design is entertaining, especially the way that it incorporates 90s TV and video game allusions. However, it is also extremely fake looking. You will find yourself asking questions like ""How did they do that effect?"" and ""Who did the animation?"" when you should be engaged with the story. Which brings us to the big problem with this movie.
Story: This is not so much a bad story as it is a badly told story. The premise is solid and something that you will not see in most movies. A man stricken with depression who has remained locked in his apartment for 16 months tries to kill himself when his television dies. He fails and meets a talking pile of mold who promises to get his life back on track. At first the man's life improves dramatically. However, it soon becomes apparent that The Mold does not have The Man's best interests at heart. The only problem with the story is that it is impossible to tell what is going on. What is real, what is hallucination, what is literal, and what is symbolic, remains a mystery even after the fact. Also, it doesn't give the audience any cathartic release in the climax and denouement, which makes it a frustrating sit.
In short, this is a bad movie, partially because it is so fake looking, but mostly because it is impossible to follow and does not resolve in a satisfying fashion. However, it is bad in an interesting, original, creative, and even challenging way, which is still worth something.",1463443200,,2856,4.714

The desolation-strewn,depressing,nuclear-strength anxiety-ridden window we're gazing into now reveals a reclusive loser that's become so fed up with the world and its everything that he's holed himself up in his apartment for over a year. He literally commits suicide over his tv dying.
His tv's name is Kent.

After smashing his head accidentally during said suicide attempt his head conjures up an entire alternate scenario and future for himself.
Though this future is also one of neurosis and torment there is something dangling at the end of the darkened hallway promising enough to keep him stumbling senselessly forward. The character,Ian,lets you know that he's definitely cracked up in the head. Even explaining that weeks into his exile he stopped watering the house plants because ""they were plotting something untoward and needed to be dealt with.""
 This guy thought his plants were plotting to kill him !!

 Once Ian starts taking advice from the mold on the walls we're taken on a wild ride through the absolute chaos of nightmarish schizophrenic delirium. The scene where the first tv repairman arrives is one of the greatest surreal scenes i've ever watched and is also hilarious.
 Since the whole story takes place in Ian's apartment you really become drawn inside this universe unto itself of claustrophobic madness.

 Writhing in pain with your head in your hands in a filthy bathroom while the mold on the wall becomes your motivational coach.

 Either peer into the window of insanity or don't.
 But don't complain that what you see inside isn't a heaven full of pleasant sunshine to bask in when you DO look inside it.",1438819200,,1826,5.016556291390729

I feel like throwing this in the garbage, rather than it even taking up any space in my home.  I thought it was not only disgusting, but also boring.

8679240,4,B00NMV887G,"Don Thacker's ""Motivational Growth"" is a bizarre hyperbole-truly modern. Honestly I think the film will be this generation's ""Little Shop Of Horror"", just replace the singing with fun animation graphics rife with Adult Swim quality humor. Actually take that film and shake it with some ""Stay Tuned"" and you have the perfect horrortini for your maturing viewing pleasure. It is a story of madness in true-to-form dark, satirical entertainment.

Let's just say that even though the premise, at times, seems predictable or flagrant, it still manages to carry some very entertaining and surprising moments. It is just a fun story, that is executed wonderfully by Thacker both with the writing and directing. The special effects and sound track used on ""Motivational Growth"" are both very stylized, practical effects that push the story even further into the dark, satirical wasteland. The special effects offer up some truly gross and lighthearted exaggeration to the situation at hand with Folivor's condition and circumstance. The practical effects are done nicely, reminiscent of mid 80's horror comedy stuff notably ""TerrorVision"" .",1431475200,2,1132,5.431818181818182
