6282186,5,B00IN69Q9O,Another brilliant  season (less than 3 hours long) in this unmissable  series. It is a pity that the  seasons are getting shorter. Truly a winner all the way.,1404604800,6,158,4.571428571428571

6282190,4,B00IN69Q9O,"The producers of the Universe seem to have taken the show in a more diverse direction in terms of what subject matter is covered.  In Season 7 the Pyramids of Egypt, the Star of Bethlehem, the destruction of Sodom and Gommorah,  and Stonehenge are covered.  For instance, the episode about Stonehenge discusses what function the stone ring could have served its builders. Was it an astronomical calculator for keeping track of the seasons.  What were all those holes chiseled out of the chalk of the Salisbury plain used for, predict lunar eclipses?",1401408000,13,549,4.934782608695652

 And it was only  4 episodes. All speculative and uninteresting--to me--anyway.
It wasn't worth the 6 bucks and I own all the other seasons. So this series has meant a lot to me. How else could we learn  so much about Our Universe?

They know so little about each segment,, all 4 could have been one episode. And how could a whole season be just 4 episodes???

 I feel like whoever did this, just doesn't care anymore. Too bad. Maybe someone else will pick it up and bring freshness to it again.

6282235,1,B00IN69Q9O,"This DVD is awful and you should not buy it.

The Universe started off as one of the best shows I'd seen in a while.  Science changes constantly, but it made an honest effort to keep up with scientific advances and didn't shy away from interesting topics.  There was little to no attention paid to religion, fantasy, or other non-factually based concepts.  It was science, and it was good.

Starting in season five and getting worse from that point on, the show became...well, really bad.  Atrocious, even.  It moved to trying to put god into every episode that didn't involve aliens or speculative fiction.  Religion already ruins so much in the world; that it ruined one of my favorite shows, corrupted it, and turned it into something repugnant is saddening but par for the course.  I'm disappointed in the History channel, as well.  Rather than forcing ridiculous, wild, fact-averse shows to up their game and stop the embarrassing parade of material like Ancient Aliens, Decoding the Past, and UFO Hunters, History Channel took one of their few franchises that actually had a basis in fact and reduced it to the factual level of Fox News.

Don't bother with this season.  Get seasons one through four, maybe season five, and then call it a day.  You'll be as happy with those shows as you will joyful that you didn't buy season six, or this piece of Christian-pandering, lowest-common-denominator, science-mocking piece of junk.

Mind you, I have no issue with Christians who practice their faith and don't try to force their beliefs on abortion, sexual orientation, race and gender onto others in a Sharia-esque parody.  God just doesn't belong in a show about provable, peer-reviewed scientific discovery of the Universe, at least not until there is some quantifiable evidence, and including him is more of the dumbing-down of science that has left the world in general and the US in particular drastically short of the needed scientists to solve upcoming challenges.  With sciences as diverse as climatology, evolutionary biology, astrophysics, fetal and stem cell tissue research, genetics, and wildlife biology under assault by Christianity in the US and various other religions abroad (Sharia law and Orthodox Judaism, for instance, are no kinder to science than fundamentalist Christianity) under constant assault, it is saddening to see a rare bright spot reduced to one more victory for the darkness of ignorance.",1441324800,13,2427,5.075566750629723
6282236,5,B00IN69Q9O,"I have rewatched this show so many times and it always keeps my interest. Very informative and definitely interesting.

6282255,1,B00IN69Q9O,"A big pile of speculative garbage.  As has been noted, the creators of his series seem to have run out of ideas somewhere around season 4, apparently in the belief that since they had already spent a whole 45 minutes on every actual SCIENTIFIC subject related to space that they could think of, that they were done with science and would now produce fake documentaries on UFOs and aliens building the pyramids.  No doubt they would defend this as keeping an open mind, and there are plenty of people who eat his stuff up (I did too for a while, and then I turned six), but this is no more valid than claiming that the earth is flat and is the center of the universe.  Such claims aren't just wrong because they're ridiculous, they're wrong because there's no evidence to support them, and in fact all the evidence that does exist contradicts them.  A simple rule is that the more extraordinary the claim, the more extraordinary the evidence for it must be.  The makers of this season's the universe seem to believe that any claim, no matter how outlandish and speculative, is worth airing, no matter the complete lack of evidence, and if necessary, faked ""evidence"" will be provided though usually they don't even bother with this.  Unless you're a true believer in his stuff, don't waste your time and money.",1427328000,10,1309,4.645021645021645

6282282,4,B00IN69Q9O,"Haven't viewed all the dvds, so I can't comment on the overall technical quality- so far so good.
For the content of the shows, that's a matter of personal taste that should be left up to the viewer:  I'm a fan, but that's a personal taste.",1405641600,,240,4.217391304347826

8643553,2,B00IN69Q9O,"There is massive confusion on the labeling of episodes. I have season 1-6 already and this disc only came with 4 episodes. However, on Amazon primes you can stream season 7 with 10 episodes. Also, this season is not as good as the amazing 6 previous seasons. Too much about what ancient civilizations thought and speculation of biblical content. Lets get back to the science please.",1520812800,,382,4.803030303030303

8643559,3,B00IN69Q9O,I made a mistake buying this one because this one is too much biblically connected comparing it to season 6 and that's a misnomer. Too speculative and disappointing on the biblical aspect ratio.,1491004800,,194,4.909090909090909
8643560,3,B00IN69Q9O,VERY Skeptical. I should have expected that from a science documentary about unexplained phenomena. They have an explanation for everything!,1487203200,,140,6.05
