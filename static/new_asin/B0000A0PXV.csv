1900398,5,B0000A0PXV,"Lt. Dillon,

  My name is Mark and I am a Police Officer in the province of Ontario.  I am a member of a Detachment which is situated in a small northern community in the Northwest Region of the province.  Our Detachment polices this community, the surrounding bush area and two First Nations Reserves.  The detachment presently consists of 6 Provincial Constables and our Detachmnet Commander, our closest back up is approximately 270km to the south and West.  Therefore officer safety and knowing how to stay alive in harrowing situations has become paramount.  I have already been in a situation where difusing a fight between bar goers turned into the crowd of 30 people becoming very hostile towards myself and my partner.  Luckily cooler heads prevailed and the instigators in the crowd were moved along.

  About a week later I received your DVDs Police Combat Tactics 1 & 2 - our General Headquarters' library had them on file and I had ordered them several months back.  They could not have come at a better time.  I watched them with my wife and was instantly impressed.  The techniques are simple to follow and they work very effectively - I had her try them on me.  She's 4ft 10"" and 110lbs and I'm 5ft 11"" and 210lbs and she got me down and under control each move we tried.

  The purpose for my letter is to thank you for producing these DVDs and to also see if you had anything on paper - an instruction manual that could be e-mailed to me as a quide when training.  I understand if that is not possible, but would appreciate anything you could send.  More importantly thank you in advance for teaching me the skills to survive - I thank you, my wife thanks you, as do our families.

Take care and stay safe.

Sincerely,

  Mark",1125100800,8,1744,4.54516129032258
1900399,3,B0000A0PXV,"This is a first tape in a two tape series aimed for police officers, by Kevin Dillon. In this tape, Dillon handles several aspects of police hand to hand combat, the emphasis being in principles, rather than techniques.
At the beginning of the tape, Dillon shows several excersices to help you maintain good physical condition. The interesting thing about these exersices is that Dillon shows how you can integrate them in your hand to hand combat training. For example, during sit-ups Dillon advises you to keep your chin tucked into your chest to reinforce that habit when falling. Therefore, you get practice on falling safely at the same time you are working on your abs.
Dillon handles issues like overcoming fear, observing your surroundings (Dillon uses term ""visualization"", which is usually meant mentally training a physical skill), and levels of force appropriate to the situation.
The main portion of the tape covers what Dillon refers as ""flash bang tactics"", meaning aggressive use of force, in conjunction of feint manouvers. The principles include attacking, rather than counter-attacking, using preferably at least three different attacks on a opponent, and using diversion in attacks. This is wise in tactical sense, but it may easily lead to excessive use of force. For example, if un-cooperative suspect uses passive resistance, according to Dillon you should attack him with at least 3 different punches, before trying to get him into a handcuffing position. Dillon warns not to use excessive force, but I feel that if you follow these techniques, that may very well happen.
Technique-wise this tape does not offer that much. There are some interesting details (for example, by giving you some unusual but effective striking points). The only portion of the tape that concentrates more on techniques is defending against sucker punches. There Dillon shows few techniques, but he does not teach them in very detailed manner, and they don't seem very realistic for average street cop to use.
Technical quality is average. The film was shot using only one camera, and many times the camera is zooming too close, not giving you wide enough view. For example, the camera may be filming Dillon from the waist up, not showing his arms, and therefore not allowing to see the technique presented very well.
To truly survive an hostile encounter, you have to survive it physically, mentally and legally. I feel that this film may help you with the first two, but it might put you in jeopardy with the third one.

1900400,5,B0000A0PXV,"This is a well-done, informative and balanced (action and dialogue)video. Lt Dillon is obviously well versed in theory and application of these life-saving techniques. He has created a style of self defense specifically for law enforcement and military personnel that draws on traditional martial arts disciplines. The approach is non-lethal and the result is smart, sophisticated ""street fighting""--what better way to handle hostile aggressors. Our police officers and members of the military need this training.",1065657600,,513,5.8533333333333335
1900401,5,B0000A0PXV,"Finally, someone has had the good sense to document the exceptional teaching ability of Kevin Dillon.  Lt. Dillon's a natural teacher who knows what he wants to accomplish during his training sessions and then gets results.  People actually use what they learn from him because the training is so logical and practical.  This video provides trainers with all the components of police combat tactics, broken down into smaller segments for effective teaching.  There is an excellent balance between promoting a message of police self defense and using force appropriately.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1058140800,,608,5.3578947368421055
