7909194,5,B00000I1MG,"This paranormal excursion into the civil war's most bloody battle, is a ghost hunter's guide on what to look for when visiting any of the civil war battlefields throughout the country! This documentary was fun to watch, historical in value & yet quite chilling in the verbal & visual discription of the battle of Gettysburg! Greystone pictures & Mike Nesbitt did an excellent job. I just wish they would re-issue it on Dvd !!!",1252972800,2,426,4.77027027027027

7909196,5,B00000I1MG,"Following the theme of his Ghost of Gettysburg book series, Mark Nesbitt has put together a great documentary on the more popular ghost stories of Gettysburg.  Filmed in the actual areas in which the events occured, witnesses are interviewed or stories are told to bring the ghosts back to life!  Stories of haunted Gettysburg College, movie theatre, battlefield and homesteads around town can send a drafty chill down anyone's spine.  I highly recommend this video and also his Ghost of Gettysburg II video as well! 5 STARS!!",1031097600,5,526,5.022988505747127
