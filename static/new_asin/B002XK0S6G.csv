8383751,4,B002XK0S6G,"I always loved the English language use between siblings in Lauren Child's Charlie and Lola books and animated series. About five years ago we discovered and bought on Amazon the DVD boxset for Charlie and Lola's Season 1 in Spanish via a Mexican seller. We ended up finding that the translated Spanish language used for the dvd was just as fun as the English language used by the authoress. We also found the voices in the Spanish season 1 dvd's similarly adorable to their English animated versions.
We almost love Season 3 in Spanish. Only gave four stars because we felt the Spanish voices (definitely different from season 1) were not as adorable. Charlie's voice seems deeper and slower. Lola sometimes seems to sound too similar to Lota and on occasion you could tell there was someone faking a child voice. The Spanish translation did not seem quite on par with what it was in season 1, but this Mom was satisfied and pleased enough that she would still buy another season box set of Charlie and Lola in Spanish if the prices stay reasonable.
We are raising our children bilingually so are always trying to find between English and Spanish screen time.  We found there was an ease just being able to pop the dvd into the player and have it play right away in Spanish since it bypassed the whole menu page first thing. Its a fabulous time saving feature and when in the car most definitely a safety first aspect we respect especially when in transit with only one set of adult hands.",1472342400,,1490,4.601503759398496
