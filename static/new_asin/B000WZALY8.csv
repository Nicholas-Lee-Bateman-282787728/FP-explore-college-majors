2993058,1,B000WZALY8,"This movie has given place to a few good things. By googling the title and reading customer reviews on it, it is guaranteed to give you a good laugh. I read several reviews on this movie last night and could barely stop laughing. I rented this movie because I had probably missed my Lithium dosage. The acting, screenplay, special effects, lighting, etc, are appalling to say the least. This movie is truly bad and I can't forget the comments someone made about it which made sense. Get a group of friend, drink a few beers and wine and watch this movie, you will laugh uncontrollably. The fight scenes are pathetic, my cat could have done a better job, someone said this was a $3.00 budget movie, I say it was probably in the neighborhood of fifty cents. Cahill, the SuperHero and producer must suffer from a serious case of Ego-Delusion. His acting is also deplorable, cheesy and pathetic. He speaks with a lisp and sounds feminine. He kicks the rear end of men who are 6'0'' and 250 pounds easily. Wow, I am so scared of him. I would rather rent the Return of the Killer Tomatoes than this poor excuse of a.... well,,, movie I guess. Stay away from this assault on your intelligence. Watch something else, anything... I don't think there is a another movie out there this bad so if you randomly pick any movie from the crappy section of the video store, it will still be 100 times better than this one.",1243036800,3,1405,4.4921875

8226146,2,B000WZALY8,"Some filmmakers are just plain bad. Their ineptitude is indistinguishable from that of hundreds of other no-budget filmmakers.

Then there are the uniquely bad filmmakers. They put their own personal stamp of badness onto every project, such that their cinematic train wrecks are unmistakeably theirs alone. These are the auteurs of badness. A pantheon that includes such legends of the uniquely awful as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ed-Wood/dp/B0002W4TNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ed Wood</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herschell-Gordon-Lewis/dp/B00029RSWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herschell Gordon Lewis</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andy-Milligan/dp/B0000YEDOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andy Milligan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-The-Rock-Nelson/dp/B002AKF2GU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David ""The Rock"" Nelson</a>, and yes, James Cahill.

I've seen Cahill's first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snitch-d/dp/B00020HAQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snitch'd</a>, and his second, JUAREZ, MEXICO. (A poor man's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bordertown/dp/B000VUFJ0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bordertown</a>, about the many women murdered in Juarez, Mexico). Yes, Cahill's films are inept. But they're consistently inept. And consistently entertaining -- and hilarious! -- in their ineptitude

Cahill wrote, directed, produced, and stars in both films. Both times he cast himself in a similar role -- that of a macho, martial arts expert, doing undercover detective work. He plays a cop in SNITCH'D. A private eye in JUAREZ, MEXICO.

This miscasting is one of the funniest aspects to Cahill's films. He's a short, skinny guy who talks with a lisp. One might justifiably call him effete, if not downright effeminate. Yet he insists on playing kick-ass heroes. His detective heroes are always beating the crap out of men much taller, broader, and well-muscled than himself.

These fights scenes are a Cahill gem. They are so poorly choreographed as to appear intentionally satirical, except they're not. We get the sense that we're supposed to be taking these fights seriously, which makes them that much more hilarious!

A Cahill favorite is to beat a man's head against a hard surface, in quick jack-hammer fashion. He does this in both his films. But to avoid harming the actor, Cahill ""slams"" the actors head down slowly -- and the head clearly isn't making contact with the hard surface.

Many a Cahill ""victim"" simple collapses after a Cahill ""strike,"" feigning unconsciousness in a most unconvincing fashion. I love the bar fight in JUAREZ, MEXICO! Three tough guys are sitting at a table. One man sees Cahill glaring at him, so he whispers to his companions and RUNS from the bar, frightened of Cahill. Cahill approaches the other men. One of them, a big hulking figure, is about to attack Cahill, but the tiny Cahill simply beats him down with one blow.

Cahill then approaches the remaining man, and lisps, ""You want some of this?""

""No!"" the much bigger man begs off.

So funny to see this tiny dude with a lisp scare the hell out of men so much bigger than himself. And there are SO MANY of these ridiculous fights scenes in both films.

Of course, these films are generous in offering other forms of badness. There's the usual bad acting, cheap sets, inappropriate sets (a hospital ""in the middle of the Mexican desert"" -- we are told -- that on the outside looks like a California college campus), lame dialog, and ridiculous story points.

For instance, Cahill and his assistant tour a factory, trying to learn about a worker who disappeared. A nearby worker (Carmen Perez), notices them, very noticeably. The sharp-eyed Cahill notices her noticing. He and his assistant decide to talk to this worker.

How do they go about meeting her?

Cahill and his assistant lurk in a dark doorway, then jump Perez as she passes by. Cahill clamps his hand over her mouth, while his assistant tells Perez, ""Don't worry, we just want to talk!""

Huh? Couldn't they have just approached her?

They then tell her, by way of ""explanation,"" that they think someone is following her. But that hardly explains the need to jump and grab her. Cahill, the director, is simply trying to infuse some drama or action or suspense into the scene -- yet fails to justify it in any logical way.

Like most bad filmmakers, Cahill is an acquired taste. And perhaps he's ""growing"" as a filmmaker, because his next film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crush-Ed/dp/B002HWUUCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crush(Ed)</a>, is a comedy. So maybe Cahill realized that, since his previous films were unintentionally funny, perhaps his next project should be an intentionally funny film.

I look forward to seeing CRUSH(ED). This time, Cahill only cast himself in a supporting role. Good news, though. Reviewers have slammed the film as a dreadfully bad, unfunny comedy, so it appears that Cahill has not lost his unique touch!",1389744000,,5220,6.040595399188092

One,The acting is very very bad. Two,The fight scenes look very very fake at points of impact from punches,kicks,etc. and the following sound effects of impact even worse. Three,I't has about 30 chapters and turned it off after 3rd thats how bad it is.
I originally bought it to shed some light of curiosity of those horrible Juarez,Mexico murders of women if it's a cult,cartel,etc. but it's back to google for more information. Don't even think about it.",1344297600,,615,4.451327433628318
8226149,1,B000WZALY8,"I have pancreatic cancer and watching this movie is by far a worse experience!!!! Just kidding. Here's the real lowdown. I am a movie buff and I rented this piece of crap and 10 minutes into it, I thought... this movie is a piece of crap. I tried to struggle through one more minute because I thought, well, I know a few writers, I dabble in writing myself maybe I am being too harsh and critical, perhaps the acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, maybe it was the pizza I am eating and not the writing that made me want to throw up, or maybe I didn't give it enough time. So, I  just stopped the movie and decided to go to  amazon for reviews on this frankly  un-watchable movie, and thankfully something good came out of wasting 10 of my life minutes on this horrible ""movie"", the laughs I got from reading the other reviews! We are all in agreement, this movie sucks!!! No exaggeration there isn't a word in any language on earth that could describe, with justice how BAD Jaurez, Mexico is.
