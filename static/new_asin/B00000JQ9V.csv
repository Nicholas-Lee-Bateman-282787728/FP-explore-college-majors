7913263,4,B00000JQ9V,"These are good DVDs and they are cheap, they get all the way through the 1st season (Vol. 4 has the final season 1 episode and goes all the way to Ike's Wee Wee.) The final disc in the old South Park DVDs is volume 6 which stops at ""Clubhouses."" Below is the tracklisting of season 2:

201. Not without my anus
202. Cartman's mom is still a dirty slut
203. chicken lover
204. ike's wee wee
205. conjoiend fetus lady
206. the mexican staring frog of sourthern sri lunka
207. city on the edge forever (a.k.a flashbacks)
208. summer sucks
209. Chef's salty chocolate balls
210. chickenpox
211. rodger ebert should lay off the fatty foods
212. clubhouses

**END OF THE OLD SOUTH PARK DVDs**

213. cow day's
214. chef aid
215. spooky fish
216. merry christmas charlie manson
217. gnomes
218. prehistoric ice man

You can get ""Chef Aid"" on ""The Chef Experience"" and you can get ""Gnomes"" on ""Ghouls, Ghost and Underpants Gnomes"", I think ""Spooky Fish"" is on there too. ""Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson"" is on the ""Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics"" DVD. The only problem is you have to keep buying because those DVDs are out of order and give you episodes from other season. South Park needs to release Vol. 7 (maybe even an 8) to finish the second season. THEY KILLED THE OLD DVDS' GREATNESS, THOSE *******S!",1129766400,3,1300,4.5665236051502145
7913264,4,B00000JQ9V,"I loved ""Chef's salty choc-"" well, you know- along with the return of America's most-beloved bowel movement, Mister Hanky as he & the kids attempt to derail the First Annual South Park Film Festival. And they manage to succeed- in one of SP's most disgusting spectacles ever.
""Chicken Pox"" had its fair share of sick scenes, even if the death of Kenny in this one is rather unspectacular.
And ""Roger Ebert"", aside from doing a not-half-bad take-off of a classic Star Trek episode, gives you further insight into the life and times of the selfish, heartless eight-year-old glory hound that is Eric Cartman as he forces his way into starring in a ""Cheesy Poofs"" commercial.
But my favorite out of all the eppies on this disc is ""Clubhouses"", especially the moments where the kids are watching the ""Fat Abbot"" cartoons. Leave it up to the South Park team to turn Fat Albert & the Cosby Kids from wholesome providers of wisdom for the young'uns into ebonics-spouting gangsta overlords of the 'hood. Even though each of the three ""Fat Abbot"" segments only last for about several seconds, I found them to be funnier than most ""Def Comedy Jam"" acts I've seen. After taking a look at this show, I think you'll agree with Kyle's statement that ""cartoons are getting really dirty!"" Stan's coping with his parents' breakup and (temporary) divorce has its precious moments as well. And don't forget to look for a subliminal plug for Trey & Matt's band DVDA in this show.
I'm probably one of the few people who kinda like Trey & Matt's live intro bumpers, but they're really only enjoyable the first couple of times around. Like most of my fellow SP compatriots, nowadays I just fast-forward through them to get to the show. And the show is where the REAL fun begins!
'Late!",984268800,6,1761,4.720779220779221
7913265,5,B00000JQ9V,"Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were.  I'll review each individual episode the best I can remember now...
(oh, and i forgot to mention this in my earlier reviews, but i guess better late than never: The commentary before each episode by Matt and Trey are priceless. Very funny stuff.)
Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls: Ol' Robert Redford must not be too happy about this episode, but it certainly shows some people how commercialized things have gotten at those film festivals (which Matt and Trey probably know a bit about). I still can't believe this episode aired, because it really must have tested how far the censors would go.
Chickenpox: The two alternate stories are a.) the kids are made by their parents to get chickenpox by hanging around each other and b.) the income disparity between Kyle and Kenny's dads.
Roger Ebert should Lay off the fatty foods: The man running the Planet-arium is trying to brainwash the kids into volunteer work and Cartman is trying to get to be the Cheesy Poofs spokeskid. No, it's not much more exciting than what I just described, sorry.
Clubhouses: This was a pretty funny episode dealing with rivalry amongst friends and divorce. Stan's parents split, and the show really takes a stance on peering into the child's viewpoint... albeit a skewed one.  It's funny though, and if you don't know what DVDA is on that girl's shirt... go get Orgasmo, the movie Matt and Trey made before Southpark.",982627200,8,1662,4.727586206896552
