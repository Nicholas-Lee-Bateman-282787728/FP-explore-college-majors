8595691,3,B00DP1O1HE,"There are many questions that are touched upon in this film.  Why is Christmas celebrated on the 25th of December? Why do we bring an evergreen tree up into our house? There are many theories to these questions and the questions are answered briefly and with not a lot of explanation. The various ideas and theories are not expounded on and at points it seems as if more depth is gone into St. Nicholas and Santa Claus. There is also information on people who contributed to Christmas traditions such as Charles Dickens.

I was hoping for some theories on the Star of Bethlehem, but there seemed to be none. The film was done on location in the UK and the Holy Land. It is 41 minutes long, with no extras and no subtitles. It is hard to understand some of the experts and the narrator when they are talking, so subtitles would have been useful.
This is a film that can give you some information about Christmas, but I was hoping for much more depth.",1390780800,4,949,4.417142857142857
8595692,5,B00DP1O1HE,"Having come from the counter-church of protestant, indoctrination of tales of old that Christmas came from pagans ceremonies were common in the south.  The Basic clarification of this Documentary in that Christmas was first decided upon to be part of the calendar year on January 6.  The Roman emperor wanted December 25,  the reason was this date is the first day of the year that a person can tell that the days are getting longer.  Winter begins on December 21- the longest night of the year.  This documentary in great and will set you free from the counter churches of our time.  It is great to teach what really happen to make Christmas a Christian Holiday.  It will end false saying of our time and will help understand Christmas has event in the life of the Christians today, now and forever more.",1390435200,,805,4.626760563380282
