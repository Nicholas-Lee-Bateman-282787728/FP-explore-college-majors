4669631,2,B005EXA8P0,based on description I thought one of the stars of the movie would have a major roll but it was only a cameo appearance so I gave it away,1356739200,,137,3.7586206896551726

doing theatrical but there's nothing. Just music and 4 absurd Pictures.",1355011200,,146,4.88
4669633,4,B005EXA8P0,This movie contains Johnny Carson's finest movie performance. Also great to see Connie Francis in her very own showcase. Look for a cameo by Yvette Mimeux.,1340755200,4,155,5.0
4669634,4,B005EXA8P0,It's a wonderful Connie Francis movie for those of us who are fans of Connie. I've beena fan since I was a teenager. It's a light musical comedy that showcases her singing.,1318204800,9,172,4.40625
4669635,4,B005EXA8P0,"I admit I am a fan, but I do go along with what Ms. Francis has stated many times ""I'm no actress"". To a degree she is correct. Connie was almost the sole source of income for MGM Records and their movie division thanks to her massive record sales as the largest selling female vocalist of all time. She made her screen debut in the smash era defining ""Where The Boys Are"". For moviegoers, this was misleading. All the movie marquees had her billed as the star when in fact, she had one of the smaller female parts. She sang only the multi million selling title and one other number.

Her follow up movie, given top billing, was filled with so many silly subplots, Connie sing only 3 songs including the hit title.

""Looking For Love"" is the only one of her 4 movies where Francis is really the star. Unfortunately she is hampered by a weak and somewhat silly script. The movie is a throwback to the screwball comedies of the 30s with Francis playing a singer who decides to give show biz one more shot and if she fails, she dreams of marrying a doctor and having lots of babies. She invents a contraption called ""The Lady Valet"" to hang clothes on for women on the go to wear the next morning to work which interests her roommate's (Susan Oliver) co-worker (Jim Hutton from Where The Boys Are"". Francis misconstrues his interest for love. Enter Cuz Rickover, a grocery clerk and bass fiddle player (Joby Baker) who falls immediately for Connie after she destroys the grocery store. She is a last minute replacement on a Danny Thomas special for Gaye Swinger (Barbara Nichols, also from Where The Boys Are""). Not fully rehearsed, her musical number turns into another quite funny fiasco. I won't give the ""tag"" away, but Francis believes she'll know true love when she is kissing, she will hear bells ringing. The ending is weak.

Francis underestimates her ability. She displays a deft comic timing and while the rest of the cast is completely lost, she holds the movie together with her crazy antics and her marvelous singing. This is the only movie where she sings more songs than the other three. Fans won't be disappointed. Besides the title track, highlights are ""When The Clock Strikes Midnight"" sang on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. ""This Is My Happiest Moment"" is marred by extraneous noise such as bar blenders, shouting waiters. In her final number, beautifully choreographed violinists accompany the perfectly made up Francis  ""Whoever You Are I Love You"".

Connie made one more movie before terminating her acting career in the third and most dismal remake of ""Girl Crazy"", a muddled, cheap looking B movie. Also along for the ride in small cameos are several ""Where The Boys Are"" co-stars: Paula Prentiss and Yvette Mimieux.

If you are a fan new to her movies and want to see her in the forefront ""Looking For Love"" is the movie to get. Digitally remastered for movies on demand, you won't be disappointed.

A movie that showcases her tremendous voice and her wonderful comic timing. Faults aside, a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

4669643,4,B005EXA8P0,"The release of this movie was a long time in coming on either VHS or DVD. Thanks, Amazon, for finally making it happen. I wish a few of the musical numbers had been completed in the movie, instead of being abruptly ended, though I understand why the makers wanted to do this - for the story's sake. It was a joy to finally see Connie again in this movie after almost 40 years. Johnny Carson said that he HATED his performance in this movie. It was rumored that he was the one that kept MGM from releasing it. Who knows that the truth is....Anyway...enjoy Connie. She was so young and pert and cute. And, of course, her voice was in top condition.",1375142400,4,646,4.30327868852459

4669645,5,B005EXA8P0,"Looking For Love is my favorite Connie Francis film. She does a wonderful comedic role as Libby Caruso. She sings Looking For Love, When The Clock Strikes Midnight, Whoever You Are, I Love You, Let's Have A Party, Be My Love, I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me, and This Is My Happiest Moment.  At the time Connie was the number one female pop singer. Able support is provided by the  ever flashy  Barbara Nichols.

8469198,4,B005EXA8P0,"Pop singer Connie Francis' career in Hollywood was brief, lasting a few short years.  But in that time she managed to shine in a small but delightful clutch of films which are beloved by her fans.  1964's LOOKING FOR LOVE may be the best of them, with Connie front and centre in a story that calls upon her skills as a comedienne in addition to her singing prowess.

When her attempts to launch a singing career fail, Libby Caruso (Francis) decides that the best solution is to get married and have babies.  In the meantime she stumbles into an unexpected adventure in big business with ""The Lady Valet"", a clothes-hanging gadget for the gal on the go, which she invents.  Whilst hawking her brainchild on the Johnny Carson Show, she finds that her singing career may still have a chance... but what about that future husband?  Advertising exec Paul (Jim Hutton) is the ideal candidate... that is, if he can ever remember Libby's name!

With a bubbly plot and lots of opportunities for Connie to burst out into song, LOOKING FOR LOVE is really her best all-round movie showcase.  Most of her other films cast her as ""just one of the girls"" (like ""Where the Boys Are"", ""Follow the Boys""), but LOOKING FOR LOVE is a vehicle designed for Connie alone.  And it's utterly adorable.  In a sly nod to ""Where the Boys Are"", several of Connie's former co-stars flash by in cameo appearances, among them Paula Prentiss, Yvette Mimieux and George Hamilton.  Plus you have to love a movie where one of the characters is called 'Gaye Swinger'!

The Warner Archive disc has a great quality 'Scope print, plus the trailer.",1439942400,4,1607,4.659574468085107

8469200,4,B005EXA8P0,"Connie Francis is absolutely adorable and her charm carries this film. She stars as a struggling singer who has given up on pursuing a career and embarked on her pursuit of marriage and the man who will give her a home and lots of babies. She is frank about her intentions even to her potential employers, and miraculously she winds up on the Johnny Carson show and winds up with an agent. While she is trying to land a 6'2"" man with eyes for tall, busty girls, the world around her steers her in the right direction. This movie is chock full of catchy songs, Connie decked out in beautiful clothes, and showing off her winning personality. While the trailer misleads viewers into thinking this is a Where the Boys Are reunion, the cameos are so short it is laughable they were even advertised. This is really Connie's show all the way, and what a show!",1434499200,3,853,4.4743589743589745
8469201,4,B005EXA8P0,Connie Francis is the energetic center of the film.  Lot's of singing and fun to watch.,1434412800,,87,4.4375
