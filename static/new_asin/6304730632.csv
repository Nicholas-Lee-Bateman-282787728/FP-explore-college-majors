However, as what Peter Griffin would say ""You know what really grinds my gears?""...the tape said featuring Carmen Electra.  When I saw that, I believed that Carmen Electra was involved in one of the stories and she'd be naked, but she was only shown for a minute at a strip club as a dancer in the background and you didn't even get to see her naked.  Yeah, she looked hot just in lingerie, but isn't ""featuring"" another word for ""starring?""  That made me mad.

  Overall though, Erotic Confessions-Intimacy is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone that likes softcore porn.  I would've given it a 4 star rating, if it wasn't for that false advertisement of Carmen Electra.",1131926400,,844,4.610738255033557
