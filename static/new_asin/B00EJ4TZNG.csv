8605915,5,B00EJ4TZNG,"I liked the character, Stockinger, on the series Kommisar Rex and decided to try the spin off. Karl Markovics is a first class actor who has won numerous international awards. He brings his talents to this delightful detective series. I only wish there were more seasons.",1391299200,,271,4.913043478260869
8605916,5,B00EJ4TZNG,"The series is a quirky late 20th century police mystery set in and around Salzburg, Austria. The actors can act, the settings are engaging, and the plotting is really very good. There are no great throes of panic or passion, no revealing social comment, but the shows tend to be humorous. Enjoyable.",1354579200,,299,4.769230769230769
