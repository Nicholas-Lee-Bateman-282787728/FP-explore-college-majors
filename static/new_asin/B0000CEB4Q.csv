Since having her own, they have provided many hours of enjoyment for her. Thank you.",1398211200,,261,4.695652173913044
7999062,3,B0000CEB4Q,"I picked this dvd up thinking it would teach me common signs in a classroom, instead it just shows you what they say are common songs in the classroom.  When I realized that I thought ok maybe this will be helpful.  If you watch the version with the children they just sign and sing the song with no explanation at, it doesn't even slow down the song to sign it for beginners.  If you watch the adult version, she shows you the signs she will be using in the beginning and then signs the song.  Again with no explanation for the signs and it doesn't break down the song or slow it down at all.  My daughter also had no interest in this dvd at all.  This dvd had great potential but just doesn't deliver.  I really can't understand why this is award winning.

If you want a good signing series look at signing time.  Everything is broken down into smaller parts, there is repetition, and my daughter is captivated by it.",1310428800,,919,4.296511627906977
