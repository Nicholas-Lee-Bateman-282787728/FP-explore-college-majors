1956865,5,B0000VV4MW,"Without much knowledge of what I was in store for, I went to go see CAMP this summer. During my high school years I participated in two summers of Summer Stock theater.  Compaired to these kids we were pure amatures at best putting on shows in Uncle Bob's Barn.
CAMP takes place in the wild and involves a group of hams, prima donnas and  various others all wanting their chance in the spotlight where the competition is tough and ruthless, not only for the lead role, but also for the affections of the lone straight male at the camp.
Unlike other films in the genre (specifically FAME) The songs from CAMP are not written for a pop radio release, but in the style of major Broadway show.  From beginning to end, the musical numbers of CAMP (although not all original) will keep the listener on the edge and wanting more performance.
Of course the story evolves around the campers and their issues of trying to fit in even where they are the most accepted and also fitting in, in the real world where these kids struggle.
While the story at times drags and is there just to move along the film between songs, the overall enjoyment and good feeling the viewer is left with overcomes the shortfalls of the movie.
CAMP is a true joy and an original concept that makes it a great time at the movies.",1070841600,2,1296,4.436974789915967
1956866,5,B0000VV4MW,"This is the best movie I've seen this year.  Too bad films like these only show in one theater in town and then for two weeks max.  No promotion so small audiences.  I can't wait to get the DVD so I can see it again.  I rushed out and bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie.  Everytime I listen to the music it brings back what I felt during the movie.
I can't recommend this film enough!",1070409600,3,394,4.064935064935065
1956867,5,B0000VV4MW,"Anyone anywhere who has ever loved a musical, been in a musical trained to be an actor, put on a show, wanted to put on a show, or just listened to and loved a song ever in their lives will find something to relate to in this delightful movie. Campy in all the right places -- with its requisite gay subtext -- CAMP also provides the viewer with some of the biggest laughs of the year.  Todd Graff's knowing sensibility has culled together a mixture of poignant and funny moments from his real-life experiences at STAGEDOOR MANOR, and found just the right cast to bring his vision to life.  The musical numbers include two lovely new songs by FAME composer Michael Gore, and TURKEY LURKEY TIME, the blow-out dance feature from PROMISES PROMISES.  As welcome as a fresh summer breeze.",1065571200,7,783,4.578571428571428
1956868,5,B0000VV4MW,"It's movies like Camp that remind me what I love most about movies. It doesnt preach an agenda and doesnt make me feel like a fool for feeling sentimental. It has a little bit of cynicism but a lot of great music. There are no drugs, no guns, no car chases and no fake breasts. What Camp does, and does very well, is tell a story. Simply and completely. Camp took me into a world I was both familiar and stranger to, and made me feel better for taking the journey. While there will be little chance the film will find the same kind of mainstream hit Chicago or Moulin Rouge became, Camp should become a favorite with discerning movie musical fans and help re-usher in this dormant too long genre.
While summer camp often means nature trips, cookouts and wacky hijinks to most young people, Camp Ovation in upstate New York caters to those who are more artistically inclined. Over the two months campers attend, they will put on a new show every other week, be it drama, musical or something more avant-garde, going through the process of auditioning, creating their own sets and costumes, rehearsing and presenting a new show for an audience, then beginning anew the next day. Many of the kids at Camp Ovation are outsiders within their own worlds. Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat) is reduced to begging her older brother in order to have a date to her junior prom, while Michael (Robin DeJesus) gets beaten up at his prom for daring to arrive in drag. Fritzi (Anna Kendrick) is so starved for any attention, she spends her entire year waiting for camp so she can be the assistant to Ovations number one drama diva, Jill (Alana Allen). Our first clue things will be different this summer arrives in the form of Vlad (Daniel Letterle). Hes cute, talented and seemingly the only straight male in the entire teenage camp populace. Ellen, Michael and Jill will all fall for Vlad, even if he has no idea who Stephen Sondheim is. Each year, Camp Ovation has one artist in residence to help run the shows and inspire the nascent talent. This years guest director is Bert Hanley (Don Dixon), a once promising writer who had been the toast of Broadway with his first musical, but never delivered a follow-up show. The story follows these kids as they deal with each other over the course of the summer. Hearts are broken, lifelong friendships are created, and theres that one ambitious actress who makes Eve Harrington look undemonstrative.
From the opening credits, in which the company performs the rousing, gospel-esque How Shall I See You Through My Tears to the end, when they dance through their own rendition of The Want of a Nail, it is this group of talented youngsters who make the movie come alive. For while most of the cast are cinema neophytes, they have a warmth and energy which make them feel familiar and comfortable. The film feels almost like a documentary, for what little over-acting does appear is saved for the sequences of the stage performances. And it is these stage performances that are the best part of ""Camp."" These kids are simply amazing, their voices powerful and seductive!
Residing somewhere between Meatballs and Fame, Camp is the brainchild of actor turned writer Todd Graff, who based the story on his own experiences at the Stagedoor Manor camp (where the film was shot) as a youngster in the 1970s, where he was a camper and later a counselor during his teen years.
Making his directorial debut here, Graff has assembled a first rate team around him, ensuring the films success as a work of art. Oscar winning composer Michael Gore, Tony winning choreographer Jerry Mitchell, Rent musical director Tim Weil and Hedwig and the Angry Inch composer and lyricist Stephen Trask have all infused their individual talents together to create an extraordinary cinematic experience. I cannot stress how incredible I think this film is.  It's everything ""Fame"" SHOULD HAVE been. Camp gets an A+ for effort and an A+ for execution. Bravo!",1060819200,37,3949,4.748180494905386
1956869,4,B0000VV4MW,"The need to perform is often a result of deep-seated pain and resentment sometimes brought on by a dysfunctional childhood. And so it is with the teenagers gathered at Camp Ovation: an acting and singing summer school in the film ""Camp""; the title that operates on at least two levels.
The revelation of this film is the extraordinarily high level and quality of the performers: both singers and dancers. The spaces between the performances are average at best and silly at worst. But when these people sing and dance: watch out!
The director and screenwriter have borrowed plot lines from a number of films: ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""All About Eve"" and of course, ""Fame"" and at least they have the sense and style to borrow from the best.
""Camp"" is fun and it is thrilling to see that there is a whole generation of superb performers on the horizon that have the talent, drive and taste to avoid the pitfalls and embarrassments of the American Idol clones.",1060732800,2,957,4.7023809523809526
1956870,4,B0000VV4MW,"Following in the paths of giants of faith like Cartwright and Asbury was very enlightening and uplifting.  If more men (and women) such as these existed today, the world would be a better place.  I showed 15 minutes of this tape to my Methodist Mens group and they absolutely loved it.

1956875,4,B0000VV4MW,"If for no other reason than Anna Kendrick's version of Ladies Who Lunch that she makes her own, standing out from the tired, winking, overwrought versions of other stars. But I said, if. Because you also get Here's Where I Stand by the lovely Tiffany Taylor, Wild Horses by the lovely Daniel Letterle, and the bravado ballad I Believe in Us by Warren Wiebe.

While the CD is great listening, it's worth buying the DVD [or renting it] to see these songs performed. So much is added to your enjoyment and understanding. It's not Glee and it's not Disney. It's refreshing, professional, yes, yet so natural I just fell into the story of young people undertaking the challenges of talent.",1442707200,,684,4.7
1956876,3,B0000VV4MW,"I was torn as to what rating to give this.

In several respects, it's not all that good if we're being honest. (At least, if you're not a teenager.) The plot is thin and really only held up by teenage melodrama; it's one of those movies that makes you look back at your own teen years and feel embarrassed at how much importance you placed on liking someone and whether they liked you back. There's a fair amount of ridiculousness throughout, and plenty of scenes that really just come across as overacted. I started out quite enjoying the subplot of Robin de Jess's character - he's gay, and suffers for it, and Camp Ovation is obviously a safe haven for him - but even the resolution of that one left me with a raised eyebrow.

But despite its flaws, I still like this movie. It's got some terrific voices - including a young Anna Kendrick as Fritzi and a young Sasha Allen as Dee, as well as a few names who aren't quite as famous but still pretty incredible, like Tiffany Taylor. I will say that not all of them blew my socks off, though. Alana Allen and Joanna Chilcoat both have lead roles, and I confess, I'm not entirely sure why. Of course they're not BAD singers, but they're outclassed by some of the secondary characters. As for the songs themselves, I'll admit that some of them seem odd, or maybe out of place, but they're still awfully engaging, and there were a couple that I like very much. ""Turkey Lurkey Time"" (Promises, Promises) and ""Ladies Who Lunch"" (Company), of course, but there were several I hadn't heard before (not sure if they were originals written for the film or if they're just obscure) that I liked very well, too, particularly ""I Sing For You"" and ""Here's Where I Stand."" There were a few surprise moments of real humor, too...particularly in the scenes involving Anna Kendrick.

So while I couldn't call this film great, or even particularly good, there's just something about it that makes the flaws...well, maybe not charming, but at the very least, overlookable. And at the movie's base, we've got some awfully good music. I expect teenagers would really enjoy this, particularly any who are involved in the arts, or who maybe don't fit in all that well. And adults? It really depends on your expectations.",1440806400,,2247,4.6125

I'd recommend buying the soundtrack if you can. It's a fun listen. Sasha Allen has broken out as a Broadway star now. Daniel Letterle has done some good work (but I think he's given up on acting as of late). And of course we all know what Anna Kendrick has been up to lately (watch for her new movie musical on Valentine's Day!).

1956883,4,B0000VV4MW,"So, let's call this ""Fame"" lite! The stand out has to be Daniel Letterle, he has a wonderful voice and absolutely has a grasp of who his character, Vlad, is. the same can be said for the characters of Michael and Emily (I think).  Let me stress, this may not be good for the kids, there are all kinds of people in this so if you have some prejudices, this may not be for you. I loved the diversity and spectrum of the characters. I had quite a few surprises hit me during this film. It is about an actor/singer/dancer camp for teens. The musical numbers are outstanding. The singers are outstanding. The reason for 4 stars and not 5, well I would go 4.5 stars. The reason being that sometimes the performances are somewhat okay. that holds for almost all the actors except maybe the top 3. If you watch it you will see what I mean just now and then they miss the acting mark. The drunken teacher/playwright, big for instance.",1415664000,,925,4.3468208092485545

1956890,4,B0000VV4MW,"This movie has absolutely horrible sound levels, I found myself having to constantly raise and lower the television's volume because it goes from a lot of intimate almost whispered conversations directly into fairly loud performances.  I suppose you could hear it okay in amplified theaters, but I had great frustration with it, thus my comments.

Otherwise I thought the movie had a lot to contribute vis-a-vis special kids and their having somewhere to go to contribute and be accepted.  The transvestite beating scene was a shock, it reminded me very much of going to schools 50 years ago where worse than that cold happen to kids like him.  Kids these days don't realize how much freer and tolerant society has become since the freedom marchers and the hippy era began the shift towards tolerance.

Expect a bunch of gay/ straight angst throughout the movie.
Like most teen-centered drama it gets a bit overwhelming in sexual interaction while everyone tries to figure their silly selves out decades before achieving any kind of personal stability.",1402963200,,1052,5.057803468208093

It's occasionally a little dumb, but most of the musical numbers are actually really good! Also there's pretty good queer representation, and Anna Kendrick's character, while not overwhelmingly significant, sings a bomb ass musical number and is a total badass.

You have the typical mean girl, a homosexual male, that one girl who's a ""tomboy"", a teen girl with a slight weight problem, and a teen girl who's really shy and gets tired of being taken advantage of.

1956920,5,B0000VV4MW,"This movie is fantastic!!!! Based on a real place in Upstate New York, ""Camp"" tells the story of one summer in the lives of some VERY gifted teens. What these kids can do is remarkable.
The 2 main characters in the movie are Vlad and Ellen. Vlad is the ""new kid on the block"", being new to the camp. Ellen is a seasoned camper, who has many friends among the other campers. Their interactions are at times hysterical.
  More important than endless plot summary, is the actors themselves. As ""Vlad"", Daniel Letterle, is great. At the start of the movie, ""Vlad's"" sexual orientation is unknown, causing friends ""Ellen"" and ""Michael"" to have a friendly ""bet"" about who ""Vlad"" will end up with. Eventually, this gets resolved and a couple is formed.
  ""Ellen"" is played by Johanna Chilcoat. WOW!!!! What a voice!!! All of her tender acting, and the self-doubt of her character is immediately vanished as soon as she belts out ""And I am Telling You"" from ""Dreamgirls"". It's a short scene, but has a huge impact.
  Robin De Jesus plays ""Michael"", the VERY out gay boy dealing with recent trauma. Essentially a theater actor, Robin is fantastic as ""Michael"". He shows the mental affects of being a gay teen. The flashback scene is traumatic, just to watch.
  There are 2 other actresses that require mention. Anna Kendrick, is a 2010 Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress. She is awesome as "" Fritzie"", a timid-acting nerdy girl with big theater aspirations. Those of you who have seen ""All About Eve"", will find ""Fritzie"" familiar. The difference is Bette Davis was an adult, Anna is a teenager. She is going to be huge, in part because she is in the George Clooney movie ""Up in the Air"". It's great that she is now being recognized.
  Now its time for Tiffany Taylor. As, Jenna, she is the shinning star, at least vocally, of ""Camp"". She is at camp with her jaw wired because her overbearing father has some screwy definition of ""fat"". She mumbles through 99% of the movie. At the end, however, she sings ""Here's Where I Stand,"" a Gospel triumph, to her father, as well as to everyone else. WOW! WOW! WOW!!! This is worth seeing, if nothing else.
  The adults in this film are all secondary, except for Don Dixon, as Bert Hanley, a once-great musical composer, now a boozing loser. His interactions with the campers, and his scene with theater-legend Stephen Sondheim are perfectly acted.
This movie is one that most will wanna watch over and over. The acting is good, but it's the performances that make this movie so enjoyable.",1268524800,,2528,4.681715575620768

1956925,5,B0000VV4MW,"I understand why some reviewers of this winning movie find it a little angsty and melodramatic - because it is. But for those who remember adolescence, everything is angsty and melodramatic - it's a time of operatic emotions and overblown reactions. It's a time when you think that no one has ever loved as you have, when tripping over your feet in the lunchroom is an embarrassment that surpasses that being arrested for prostitution, and a single zit on your forehead makes you want to take to bed for a week.

In Camp, Todd Graff captures those emotions perfectly. The actor are up to the task, with Robin de Jesus giving an Oscar-worthy performance as the drag-loving Michael. I'm serious. Compare his gutsy, accomplished performance with the tentative underacting of Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game, and I think you'll agree that it was de Jesus who should have walking the red carpet with his acceptance speech folded in the pocket of his tuxedo - or his evening gown.

But all the kids are terrific performers. So much talent! Why aren't these young people on American Idol?

Camp takes place in a  special summer camp where it's the straight boys who are in the minority - much like the drama club of my high school back in the 80's.

Now we can add to the list ""Camp"", a cute, harmless little bit of fluff. It doesn't touch on any of the major ""issues"". No one gets AIDS. No one gets gay bashed (well, sort of. Someone does, in a way, at the very begining, but that's about it), and no one dies. Instead people end up in slightly awkward, real-life situations, largly centering around who's sleeping with who (whom?).

The acting is decent all around. The film is well-directed and written. The song and dance numbers are servicable. Basically, it's a nice bit of brain-candy. Nothing serious, nothing filling, but a pleasant enough way to pass 105 minutes of your life.",1196726400,,1351,7.940397350993377

What a stunning cast, great concept..in my opinion, a far more finished, tighter, thoroughly wonderful new concept for musical theatre for all ages.  This one will be performed more than ""High School Musical"" when the word gets out. The dancing reminded me of the Disney knock-out, but the acting, and singing of these amazing kids just blew the too-perfect Disney production right out of the water.

1956949,4,B0000VV4MW,"CAMP is a curious mixture of the good and the bad.  And when I say bad I mean thunderously awful.  The editing of some of the scenes, and the transitions between one scene and the next, are God awful.  We saw CAMP over the last few days and I'm still puzzled by some of the director's decisions.  I remember seeing his previous movie IN THE BEDROOM with Sissy Spacek and thinking wow, this is pretentious, and I'm glad to see he lightened up a bit with CAMP.  How serious could you be with that title anyhow?  The strange ""camp"" aspect of the movie was the plot in which little Fritzie, with her little eyes and bush of brown hair like the girl in WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, tries making herself invaluable to the popular Britney type girl Jill.  Fritzie's pretty creepy and after awhile, I started feeling sorry for Jill, even though she's unpleasant and unbelievably cruel, self centered, and sort of a big girl.  Plus, Jill proved herself talented enough to shine in the Bacharach-David number IT'S TURKEY LURKEY TIME, if I remember right the song that made Donna McKechnie a star.

By the way it does make you wonder why PROMISES, PROMISES had never been made into a movie!  I can't be the only PROMISES fan whose appetite is even more whetted than before after seeing the big office Christmas party scene on film.

Most of all, CAMP is great when Daniel Letterle is on the screen.  I didn't want to like him, but I wound up in awe of his talent, his stomach, his acting, even the way that he must be kind of short in real life but in CAMP he walks tall.  You can see why all the boys and girls at Camp Ovation love Vlad, even though (as his name suggests) he's rather an emotional vampire.  When he and the CAMP gang launch into Victoria Williams' CENTURY PLANT, it's corny all right, but thrilling at the same time, like when Tony struggles up out of his wheelchair to join Neely at the asylum rec room when she sings his great hit, ""Come Live With Me,"" in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.  CAMP isn't a great movie by any means, and in many ways a retread of FAME, but it has a heart and nowadays that's saying quite a bit.

The only fun character in the WHOLE thing is Fritzy - a girl that takes down the competition - an ""evil blonde"" of course, who i guess was supposed to be pretty. Maybe 10 minutes total. Much centers around the only ""straight""(or isn't he?) guy in camp, a male slut with some mental problems. He sleeps w/ ""the Evil girl"", dates ""the ugly girl""(who only supports the idea that ugly girls are desperate) out of pity, and flirts + suggests w/ ""the sad gay guy"" out of pity - everything and anything to trick people into liking him. The character of ""Micheal"" was the only sympathetic or likeable character, w/ a sad, lonely gay life with no parental support.

There really is no ending. Endings generally resolve things that happened, make people stronger, and punish the bad characters. Not here. One of the background characters gets closure w/ her parents, and camp ends. Don't expect to see honesty, drama, ANY consequences of actions, or anything that may interest you.

 The story is mainly about hot Vlad, who is the only straight guy at camp. He rooms with 3 other guys (all gay) and they are Shaun, Spitzer and Michael. I personally loved Spitzer because he is like the girlfriend you never had!

But anyways, this movie is trying to have them ""accept each other how they are"". But then there are always people who don't wanna. Like the camp's snot, Jill and her shadow, follower Fritzi

Vlad is sorta a man-hoe is this movie, though. Because he hooked up with Jill at the beginning, and then went out with Ellen, and then he was kissing another girl, and then his girlfriend showed up! But, everything sorts out in the end!

And the best part in the entire movie is- Vlad after he goes swimming in the lake!!!!!! Cause he gets out of the water, with no shirt on, and it pans over his HOT muscular, wet chest, and then to his face. OMG- hott!!!!

But, this movie is really funny, and just....great!!",1119052800,,1006,4.352941176470588
1956971,3,B0000VV4MW,"You really have to approach this movie as if it is a frivolous musical, where the plot is an excuse to hang a bunch of musical numbers.

This is one of those teen movie stories where adults don't exist very much and to the extent they do, they are useless idiots skulking in the background.  One adult is prominently featured, and he need the teens to teach him how to live.  Yawn.

Unfortunately, this movie also seems to follow an annoying trend in recent musicals.  You rarely see the performance of an entire song.  Even when you get more than a few lines, other visuals are interspersed.  I guess the realization is that most of the songs are so boring and unmemorable that more than a few lines of them is going to make the viewer lose attention.

And, this leads to another problem with the movie which is that, even though it's a musical, the musical numbers are just OK.  Nothing sticks out.  I can't remember the tune or words of a single one.

I do think the acting was adequate, and some of the kids are excellent singers and good performers.  But, it's hard to act when the writing is so weak.  The characters are given a jumble of character traits that just don't exist in any one person, their motivation is impossible to divine, and when the plot requires it they have an instant change to someone else.  Michael for example:  what is he ""confused"" about?  Is he questioning whether he is gay?  Is he a transexual?  Is he a transvestite?  Did he dress as a woman for his prom because he was making a statement about being gay?  Transgendered?  It doesn't make sense the way it was present.  And Vlad, how can he be so genuinely concerned about the needs of others, an extreme narcisssist and suffer from OCD at the same time?  Is he some kind of psychiatric miracle?  There are other characters as well whose motivations and shifts are very jarring.

I watched it all the way through because the musical numbers, and the overall feel of the piece was enjoyable enough.  Overall, it was just OK.",1117929600,2,2010,4.46831955922865

I rented it on a whim, and while I was surprised by some of the plot lines, I geuninely enjoyed it. The movie follows several teenagers through their summer at the quirky Camp Ovation to practice their music and dancing skills. The teenagers are as unalike as they are interesting. There's Ellen, who has amazing potential to be a star, but is somewhat of a wallflower elsewhere. Michael is her best friend, a gay teen who suffers from being in love with his roomate, the only straight boy in the camp. Which leads us to Vlad, the straight guy mentioned above and who changes the world for Ellen and Michael that summer. Other smaller plot lines are in the movie, including a particularly one concerning a snotty girl, Jill and her ""servant,"" Fritzy.

Most notably there's the opener, ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears,"" recorded (you find out in the extras) in the late, late evening in some bonechilling cold.  The DVD also contains a version of the song done by the cast at the premiere.  No lip-synching here.  These are real performers.

Also good are ""Here's Where I Stand"" (very emotional and well-staged...you see the performer and the reaction of her hard-to-please Dad in the audience) and the rousing cast ensemble piece ""Want of a Nail.""

There's also a short piece from 'Dreamgirls' that is too funny to describe here.  Let's just say the man in the scene has a little growing up to do.

I'm in the drama club at my school and quite a few of my friends in that group are guys, and i'm telling you now...they go through a whole lot of sh*t  from the other guys in school because of the stereo-type.  If anyone in my school (especially the jack*** guys) were to get hold of this movie, my friends would never hear the end of it.  ""Fritzy,"" or whatever her name was, would cause us girls quite a bit of trouble too.  A lot of people at school like to take the title ""Thesbian"" and change it around a little bit as it is, and ""fritzy"" would just enhance that rumor.

  Another one thing that i didn't like was that this movie was supposed to be about a group of teens putting on shows, but did they ever show any of the work that actually goes into them before opening night. NO!!!!!  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen did a better job of it than this movie, and that movie didn't do a great job either!  I wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone.

I personally am in Theater Technology, but can see the appeal to anyone who knows good music and comedy. I will say one thing's for sure, the actors are terrible at acting. After watching my crappy actors for many hours I can say this qualifies as crap if you critique acting. The cast is young and relatively unknown which shows what a low budget film this was. But remember sometimes it's that crappy acting and low budget that makes you laugh (cheap Japanese movie anyone?).

1956988,3,B0000VV4MW,"Let's be clear from the very beginning:  The only redeeming feature to this movie was the incredible music and stage scenes.  According to the DVD extras, the cast really did its own singing for the show (they went into their recording studios then later lip-synched to their own voices), so for that alone, the talent is amazing and worth a watch.

The acting, however, is dull and listless; the plot, thin, trite, and insanely weak.  Sure, the movie is supposed to be about the whole ""accept people for who they are"" theme, but the plot unfolds in such a formulaic manner, leading to its own forced and therefore incredible conclusion, that feeling any joy or sympathy for these characters is difficult.

The movie focuses a majority of its attention on Vlad, a cute boy whom the entire camp (boys and girls) develops an instant collective crush on.  Vlad makes clear from the very beginning that he's straight, pretty much by bedding a girl early on (it's not entirely clear whether they actually have sex or just engage in some heavy third base action), then dating another girl, Ellen, pretty much out of pity.  In the meantime, he can't stop flirting with Michael, the gay boy who bears all the psychological scars of being beaten and otherwise mistreated at school for his homosexuality.  I don't know if this is supposed to be considered charming, or cute, or funny, or the essense of coming of age, but it made my skin crawl.  This kid was a boy-slut, and his charm and good looks couldn't make him look like an angel after all the stuff he pulled.

(By the way, it's interesting to note that the movie makes clear that Vlad is the only straight boy at the camp that summer... but then all the gay boys except Michael float off into the background after that.  Where did the other gay boys go?  Did they not have other compelling story lines?)

The subplot involving a super-talented girl whose parents can't stop calling her fat is wildly transparent and could be predicted from miles away.  From the moment we meet her -- she's greeted at the bus drop-off point by a friend from the previous summer who says, ""So glad you could make it!  I thought your parents were sending you to Weight Watchers camp!"" -- we can tell where it's all headed.  Of course, we also find out that her parents have wired her jaw shut to help her to lose weight.  Apart from being just plain cruel and borderline child abuse, what the heck is a girl supposed to do at a camp for the dramatic arts when she can't open her mouth to speak?!?

And then there are the other, stranger subplots which seem to have no purpose at all:  Jill, the bitchy diva-in-training who not only has no friends save for the sycophantish Fritzi (and what was up with that strange idol worship?), but appears not to even want them, finally pushes the aforementioned Fritzi to the edge, resuling in some well-deserved comeuppance.  And there's that cute little kid with the thick glasses who, by all rights, can't really perform at the same calibre as the other kids, who's marginalized most of the summer until his big brother steps up the plate, demands that the kid get something worthwhile, and the kid hits it out of the park.  And then there's the drunk, washed-up has-been screenwriter who finds his latest work pilfered and performed by Vlad so that he suddenly has a change of heart and renewed career prospects.

All in all, the plot line was weak.  But the song and dance numbers were excellent, and there's definitely some raw vocal talent in this ensemble.  I wouldn't say not to rent it, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece, or even a touching, tender film.  Just enjoy the series of mini-shows.",1094428800,14,3677,4.62
1956989,5,B0000VV4MW,"This film is about being accepted for who you are as an individual.  It points out that even though we all have struggles there are people out there willing to care, to take the time to be around us, and to get to know us and become friends.  These friends become our family even for a short time.  This movie isn't about being gay or straight it's about being.

The music is wonderful especially since it comes from young adults and children.",1090540800,7,443,4.365853658536586
1956990,2,B0000VV4MW,"The problem with this movie is that it wasn't gay enough.

 Comparisons to Fame are inevitable, but instructive on how far we haven't come in twenty years.

 In Fame, the sensitive guitar-playing Montgomery is gay, pparently the only homosexual in the entire school, & he doesn't seem to have a romantic life of any kind. He's rather pathetic - his mother doesn't love him, he sees an analyst regularly.

 In Camp, the sensitive guitar-playing Vlad is the only straight guy at the summer camp. He has a romantic life big time, with a girlfriend at home and successfully wooing three girls at the camp (two of which he beds) and one guy (whom he flirts with not because he has any interest in sex with him, but just because he can). In fact, the entire movie revolves around him. Because he mustn't be seen to be without his own personal problems, he reveals to his gay friend that he has an unusual brain disorder (he obsessively counts the letters of words). That of course puts him on an exact par with a cross-dressing gay youth who gets beaten up at his junior prom and has been rejected by his parents. Why, we're all a bit ""queer"", aren't we?

 Having restored one character's self-esteem, Vlad proceeds to do the same with one of his would-be girlfriends - he's not so successful at this, what with his sleeping around and all which she seems to find objectionable. But then for his major project, he rehabilitates the career of a washed-up Broadway composer. Thank God for straight males!

 Apart from the pathetic love-struck guy, all the other gay boys in the picture recede into the background very early on. There is an amusing interchange between one of them and the camp sports counsellor (""WE have a SPORTS COUNSELLOR??"") that might have been developed into a comic subplot. Other characters might have been developed to explore further what it is like to be adolescent and gay - there aren't a lot of movies with popular appeal that have done that.

 Instead, there's a silly subplot involving the camp ""rich bitch"" and her slavish follower, who later turns against her with a vengeance. (I think this was supposed to remind us of ""All About Eve"" but it seems more on the level of Archie comics or The Brady Bunch). There's a running gag (with an incongruously dramatic denouement) centred around a girl whose parents have had her jaw wired shut so she'll lose weight during the summer.

 The musical numbers are by and large good (read: fantastic for the opening number ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears?"" featuring Sasha Allen & ""Here's Where I Stand"" with Tiffany Taylor). On the whole, however, I'd suggest renting this to see once, rather than buying it.",1090454400,6,2679,4.672340425531915

Being a teen actor myself, I connected with the story and the characters. So, why only 4 stars? Uhh..well, it's not a perfect movie. While the leads are excellent- Fritzi's surprise solo is amazing= some of the secondary characters are weak and it plays more as a documentary than a serious musical like Moulin Rouge or Chicago. Still, every theater has a Michael or even a Vlad. A must for all musical theater fans.",1089244800,3,556,4.683673469387755
1956994,5,B0000VV4MW,"When a movie has names like Oscar-winning composer Michael Gore (Fame), Tony Award-winning lyricist Lynn Ahrens (Ragtime), Choreographer Jerry Mitchell (Hairspray), Musical supervisor Tim Weil (Rent), and the granddaddy of them all, ber-producer Steven Sondheim associated with it-well, you know it must be something special. All these ""big names"" of the musical world practically donated their time and talent to writer/director Todd Graff's labor of love, Camp. The results turn out to be a modern, gayer version of ""Fame"". (Yes, apparently, Fame could get gayer.)
The story follows the campers as they spend their summer at Camp Ovation, a performing arts camp based on Graff's real-life childhood experiences at just such a camp. There's plenty of drama (and not just on the stage), and the kids are learning more about themselves than performing. Michael, who is openly gay and the recent victim of a gay-bashing, is struggling with his family's rejection and self-image. Ellen has such low-self esteem that she begs her brother to take her to prom. Dee is terrified of being a fag-hag for the rest of her life. Fritz is so obsessed with being friends with Jill (the popular girl) that she is losing her own identity. Even the seemingly perfect Vlad, the boy no one can believe is really straight, has his own demons to fight.
The story and writing is strong, the characterizations are even stronger. Each of the kids at the heart of the story is amazingly well-developed. I would have loved to have seen more development with some of the secondary characters, but you can only do so much in 114 minutes. The most impressive part of the whole movie is the kids themselves though. They're not all the best actors in the world, although they all portray their characters quite convincingly. Not a single one of them had ever been in a movie before Camp. What's so impressive is their musical talent. These kids have pipes! I'm sure we haven't seen the last of this cast.
One of the ways I judge a movie is how it affects me emotionally. Camp hit me hard on several levels. I found myself laughing out loud quite often. (My favorite line is when Spitzer turns to Jill after a particularly bitchy moment and says, ""I think I know your step-sister. Cinderella?"") I was moved to tears almost as often. This movie quickly took its place among my all-time favorite movies. Highly recommended.",1088985600,4,2389,4.872235872235872
1956995,5,B0000VV4MW,"I instantly fell in love with this movie, with its real but amazing cast, especially the gorgeous Daniel Letterle! I immediately went online to order the soundtrack, which is unique, given it's teen-musical air. You get to follow aspiring performers to camp where they perform touching, humorous, and even disturbing shows. But in the end, its all about discovering who you are and who you want to be- On stage and offstage.",1088812800,,424,4.902777777777778
1956996,3,B0000VV4MW,"I don't think Camp was half as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be.  The cast is made of aspiring actors playing aspiring actors.....what could be more appropriate?  Granted their acting skills aren't polished.  But they are portraying actors in musical theater.....their voices are what matters.  And I have to say everyone in the film had fantastic singing voices.  I am glad Camp wasn't cast with young pop stars turned actors (Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, the Olsen Twins, Bow Wow). This cast, imperfections and all, was truer to the form.
Even if you don't appreciate musical theater, the theme of kids growing up and trying to find their place in the world is a key part of this movie.
What I appreciate most about Camp is how it portrays teens as having aspirations and goals in life.  It's not one of those teen-exploitation films where teenagers are portrayed as being pot smoking, sex-obsessed, and souless (i.e. American Pie).  We need more films that challenge teens, without being ridiculousely wholesome.  Camp has achieved that.",1087948800,9,1059,4.9772727272727275
1956997,5,B0000VV4MW,"i just pushed the ""eject"" button on my dvd player, and immeadiatly found myself loggging onto amazon to buy this amazing dvd! the plot is interesting, the characters loveable, and the musical numbers will blow you away. in this feel good movie, a bunch of kids from different backgrounds spend a summer together at an elitist theatre camp, ""camp ovation"" (based on stagedoor manor). the plot unfolds as personalities clash, crushes are formed, and friendships are made. as someone who is a lot like these kids (im 14 years old and have been involved in theatre for my entire life), this movie shines a very good light on the type of people involved. these are not mainstream teenagers, but they still project an air of normalcy that helps you relate to them throughout the movie.
everyone will see a bit of themselves in jenna (i may have her name wrong), a girl of normal weight who is constantly brought down by a pushy, inconsiderate father who insists that she needs to lose a couple of pounds. her solo number, ""heres where i stand"", brought me to tears, as i also have dealt with weight issues in the past.
ellen is also a character that teenage girls will relate to. ellen is an outspoken, plain looking drama buff who falls for the camp stud (and only straight guy), vlad. her story is very real, and makes us realize that we all need to be loved.
another of my favorite characters was michael, a gay teen who deals with many issues, heavy and light, ranging from homophobia and his dwindling relationship with his parents to acne and his crush on vlad, who is unfortunately not same sex oriented. a self described ""freak"", michael is funny yet deep, and those who have not been exposed to different sexual orientations will be surprised at how normal michaels problems are.
jill is the token ""mean girl"". the actress cast as jill plays the villan so well. by the end of the movie, you will hate her. her arrogant nature and mean spirited schemes add to the movies plot.
my favorite character, however, was fritzie. fritzie, described by one of the camp counselors as ""a scary little girl"", begins her stay at camp ovation by befriending the aforementioned villan, jill. fritzie suddenly finds herself doing everything she possibly can for jill, including toting her luggage, serving her drinks, and even washing her underwear. when her relationship with jill falls through, fritzie finds herself on a quest to make jills life a living hell, and delightfully succeeds. i found myself laughing (in a good way) at her drive, and her performance of sondheims ""ladies who lunch"" is electric.
the musical numbers are amazing and varied, from the upbeat and peppy ""turkey lurkey"" to the sob inducing ""heres where i stand"" to the sing along ""century plant"".
the characters are very believable, but i was dissapointed with the male lead, vlad. i felt his performace was weak, and i don't think he didn't really understood who his character is. although he was good looking, i think his part couldve been cast a bit better.
i highly reccommend this movie to everyone involved in musical theatre, and even those who arent. i give a standing ovation to the cast of ""camp""! well done!",1087776000,8,3180,4.741877256317689
1956998,1,B0000VV4MW,"Stupid is the only word for it. If only they had had a writer, a director and some kids who could act. But they had none of these. Some of the kids, only some, could sing and/or dance, but none could evoke any believability. Of course they were yoked with a hacknyed, cliched, unfunny script.
And please, give me a break! Having been involved in theatre for nearly 50 years I can attest that there are INDEED many gay guys, however, there are always more, by far, ego driven, ""I am god's gift to womankind"" straight morons.
BTW, did the casing director go out of their way to cast only unattractive guys in the gay roles?",1087516800,4,621,4.362068965517241

The music is wonderful; I just ordered the soundtrack.  The music tends to be pop with a slight gosple edge to it.  Fans of the music of rent or newsies will appreciate this music.

The horrible script is a leftover from the 70's where all the gay characters were pathetic, pining ove the straight guy and being beat up all the time. Does the gay kid have to be the drag queen? (and I love drag queens and drag queens in movies but COME ON)
Also the stereotypical nasty girl who is mean to everyone and gets her comeuppance. Such a worn out stereotype. At least ""SAVED"" was trying to make a point with such a character.
Yes the lead is hot and deserves a better script. The gay character deserves a better part. Just a bad movie overall. Skip to the musical numbers and don't even watch the rest.
If they were going to have such bad lines and stereotypical characters they should have gone ALL THE WAY and made it ""camp"" in a john waters style send-up of kids who go to musical theatre camp. That would have been fabulous!",1087257600,2,1072,4.338308457711443
1957001,3,B0000VV4MW,"I've always been a sucker for movies that take place during the summer season. It probably has to do with the romanticized notion that anything is possible during this limited seasonal window and that many of the stories told have to do with characters coming of age in one way or another. Some of my favorite ""summer"" movies include well-known crowd pleasers like ""The Flamingo Kid"" and ""Dirty Dancing,""  little seen gems like ""The Man In The Moon,"" and guilty pleasures like ""Summer Lovers"" and ""Little Darlings."" While I did not see ""Camp"" when it first came out, it received generally good buzz so when the DVD came out I decided to give it a shot.
While by no means a perfect movie, ""Camp"" is hard to resist. Its strengths lie in a certain earnestness that is missing from most movies involving teens. As fun as movies like ""Heathers"" can be, there is a certainly a place for movies that may not be as dark or witty as the aforementioned but go in a different direction. Although I hate to give too much away in most of my reviews, it's not too much to say that the movie takes place in a musical camp that attracts kids who don't quite fit in with whatever ""normal"" is. I don't know if it was due to its marketing campaign or the movie's title, but many seemed to expecting this movie to be a send up of sorts of life at an unusual camp. So if you are looking for something ""campy,"" this is not that movie.

The Good:
The casting people chose to go with unknown singers over ""actors"" and it pays off beautifully as the movie has some killer songs performed with passion and it makes a strong case for following your bliss, no matter how geeky it may seem to others;
There are many funny moments that are well-earned and there are not too many cheap shots at the expense of the characters;
It tackles sexual, aesthetic, racial differences and phobias in a way that is not too heavy-handed;
The best thing that this movie has going for it is spirit. In spite of many wrong turns, the director has established a ""plucky"" ambiance in which you are rooting for most of these kids no matter what.
The extras: There is a ""making of"" segment that to me shows that this movie could have been an even better experience had it been made as a documentary. The writer/director attended the school that serves as the backdrop for the story, and he possesses an energy and likeability that may be stronger than anything captured in the film.
The Bad:
The script is weak and has structural challenges. We are introduced to many characters yet the film focuses on a charismatic character who, while vital to the story, acts in ways that make little sense because they are story-driven rather than character-driven. The script also fails to empower or even follow some of the kids that we are introduced to so only through song or dance do we get a minor glimpse into something that feels real;
There are some heavy handed storylines, one involving a teacher and alcohol, and the other involving sexual orientation that don't belong in this movie. Also, while the movie has a running joke/truism about there not being any straight guys at acting camp, it fails to depict gays as anything other than guys who want to dress like women. Even a throwaway line saying that such is the case would have made a difference, as both the questions and expositions focus on why a guy would want to dress like a girl and never on the real issue for most. Shows like ""My So Called Life"" have tackled both of these issues in a funnier and more realistic manner;
Although it's an ensemble piece, the story does not really allow the characters to gel collectively to show one of the reasons as to why these kids are drawn to the camp. There is a mean-spirited exchange that puts down a talented albeit overweight character, yet the writer director fails to even show her again or possibly show that she's no freakier than anyone else at camp;
There is a deleted scene involving a softball game in the DVD extras that shows the root of where this movie fails to deliver. While it is very strong in introducing us to characters and showing them performing with all of their might, the writer/director seems to want to tackle several ""serious"" issues, and those scenes just don't fit into the story and take away what is working. The movie would have been much better had it focused on what it feels like to be at camp and the little/big things that can happen between the performances it chronicles.
In a nutshell, I think that is this a movie that has enough merits to recommend it. Many of the musical performances in and of themselves are worth seeing it and would serve to remind some of how truly awful those kids from ""American Idol"" are. Nothing against those chosen for said show, but it seems to me that the decision makers are not looking in the right places. But I digress....
In a time when most movies involve things exploding and people being killed, it's nice to see a little movie that reminds us that there was a time when we had a full season to think and play without worrying about grades, jobs, interest rates and an increasingly unsafe world. This movie easily earns 3 stars if you keep expectations light.",1085616000,3,5197,4.515923566878981

And while ""retarded"" doesn't really seem like a word efficent enough to describe a film, I feel that there is no other way. The cast of actors are so bad, that I found myself cringe-laughing through the entire film. Maybe the dialogue is partly to blame, I mean, how bad does a film have to be, if some of the longest conversations go something like this.( Girl:""What are you listening to; sounds like pretty regualar music. It doesn't sounds special at all"".Boy:""Sometimes it's nice not to be special"". Girl:""Jump off the roof"".) And that's just me telling you; I can't decide whats worse, the lines themselves, or the absolutely atrocious manner in which the actors deliver their lines. I mean,most of the film isn't meant to be funny; and yet, I was literally wetting my pants during some of the ""serious"" moments.
I seriously cannot stress enough how cringingly bad this film is. When I read the reviews that were raving on about this film in a serious manner, I thought that the whole web had decided to play a personal joke on me; see that's why I give it three stars. If there was ever a movie that was so,so,so,so, And I mean sosososos bad that it was actually good in a way, then Camp is that movie. The acting is so bad, the dialogue is so cheesy, and well...bad, that you cannot help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. And the ending?

The actors seemed to approach the material gamely enough but it is obvious that they had very little if any acting experience or training for the screen because it looks like somebody video taped a stage play ... in a high school. The main character is insipid and if he's strait, I am. The makers decided to put marginal talent in the fore while allowing greater talent to be shunted off to the back. They could have been very subversive and created quite a camp send up but the makers seemed to be playing the action strait which just perplexed me. The behind the scenes is good. It lets you see the talent of the kids who were pushed into the background and everyone is so excited and happy for the opportunity. After all this criticism I'm sure your wondering why such a high mark. It's all about the music. The numbers are great and the opening and closing made me want the soundtrack.

As a former choir/theatre student, I found ""Camp"" a delightful walk back to my own teen years and the ups and downs of growing up dreaming of Broadway. I loved the music. My daughter's choir teacher heard the musical numbers and was impressed with both the talent and scores. Basically, the film is for theatre students, and those adults with a passion for theatre.

1957008,4,B0000VV4MW,"This movie would get three stars from me just for its portrayal of Vlad's (Daniel Letterle) mostly nude body dripping wet in one of the concluding scenes.  (Sorry, but it's true!)
It earns the fourth star by being the most unabashedly fun movie I have seen in years.  The casting in this movie is right on, and the ensemble cast has a phenomenal chemistry; they look like they are having the time of their lives.  Theatre jokes abound, but they are sufficiently explained so as not to alienate the dramatically uncultured.
Unfortunately, the movie -- despite valiant efforts to pull off a brilliant theme -- ultimately fails.  It's hard to explain precisely why.
The central song of ""Camp"" is about living life in spite of failure, and is about the most catchy thing this side of Abba: ""Hey, do you wanna come out / and play the game? / It's never too late.""  But in the end, every attempt the movie makes to tap into real emotion is undermined by a fundamental confusion about who we are, as human beings.  ""Camp"" portrays adolescence as a wasteland -- and this reviewer, for one, finds that interpretation both simplistic and untrue.
In other words, the message is, ""It's never too late to come out and play the game -- but trust me, you will lose.""  In other words, this is the same old Holden-Caulfield ""life-is-not-worth-but-what-the-hell"" adolescent depiction, with some brilliant songs, some beautiful bodies, and some very gay teenagers thrown in.

Anyone who's not really into theatre that much...still give it a try! It's very funny and entertaining! I just love how in this movie they let you get an inside look in these kid's lives and see their flawless talents!! Bravo!!,1082419200,,534,4.691489361702128

I was just thinking to my self,""If this guy is any thing like Vald i real life i would be all over him! I mean he's cute and can really act and not to mention that he also sings and can play gee-tar!"" You could imagin by heart break when i found out he was getting married.:( But the movie, it was also very very wonderful alnog with the rest of the cast. This touching movie hit base with lots of things going on in my own life and it opened my eyes. Also if you loved this movie like i did you will love the Broadway show RENT and you must see it. I am so glad movie's are expanding their horizons by having subject matter that includes cross dressers & homosexuality, people need to understand and respect people that are differant from them selfs. Can you belive that Daniel is 24(or 23 i forget) at the time that they filmed the movie! Well i'm looking forward to seeing him in other productions that have as much meaning as CAMP does. (...).

1957011,4,B0000VV4MW,"Camp really isn't a great film; it is unintentionally awkward at inopportune moments in the movie. However, the one aspect of ""Camp"" that made it stick in my mind instead of drifting off like most movies I see do, was the music. In particular, two voices that drew me back to find about more about ""Camp"" were Sasha Allen and Tiffany Taylor. Allen's voice doesn't necessarily fit the atmosphere of the movie, but she is still an amazing singer and I couldn't help but take notice. Taylor's rendition of ""Here's Where I Stand"" made me cry for a movie for about the third time in my life because of how much emotion is put into it. Taylor exudes the personality of a quasi-diva: she knows what her voice can do, but she knows when to restrain her vocals for maximum listener emotion. I expect to see great things from these amazing young women in the future.",1080691200,4,856,4.493589743589744
1957012,4,B0000VV4MW,"This movie is such an anomaly in today's world.  Almost every frame of this movie is cliched and predictable.  And yet, it has an undeniable charm that makes it absolutely irresistible, even as it is very clumsy in execution.
I was very excited about this film because I am a huge fan of musical theater, particularly Sondheim (who makes a cameo in the film!).  In terms of the musical performances, I was extremely impressed--all of them are good and some of them are truly stunning.  My major disappointment is that nothing was included from Follies, which would have been absolutely fabulous.
It is the energy of the performers that makes this movie.  The acting, particularly by Letterle, is pretty commonplace.  The script is OK, but predictable.  There are some touching scenes though, particularly those involving the perpetually hung-over composer.  The other character that steals the show is that short blond boy with the spiked hair who has this infectious smile (and, of course, the line ""We have a SPORTS COUNSELOR?!?"") But, basically, there's very little outside the musical numbers to rave about.
But what spectacular musical numbers they are!  Watching ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" (particularly Kendrick) is spectacularly entertaining.  And at its sentimental best, the movie cranks out ""Here's Where I Stand"", boasting yet another great performance by a young performer.  This emotion is almost achieved during ""Century Plant,"" but Letterle's bland acting half-ruins the emotion of the song.
Clearly, the director/writer has true empathy for these misfit characters at Camp Ovation.  By the end of this film, I'm not sure what the director was trying to say, or if there was any particular message.  But I do know that, having viewed this movie, I, just like the director, love these misfit kids, who will leave Camp Ovation to return to ""normal"" society where it is Eminem, not Stephen Sondheim, who reigns over the music world.  It is this infectious love for these unusual teens, not the abundant cliches, that we are conscious of by the end of the movie.",1080259200,,2070,5.05
1957013,4,B0000VV4MW,"Written and directed by actor Todd Graff (most people will remember him as the rat toting rig worker in James Cameron's The Abyss), Camp is a delightful light gem of a film. It's Fame: The Next Generation, but it works because the cast is actually very talented. The late Jason Raize (who recently took his own life at the age of 28 in February 2004) -older Simba in the Broadway production of The Lion King -once said of that the role was a triple threat, for you had to beable to sing, dance and act. Here in this film, the cast has to do the same. Daniel Letterle shines as Vlad, the lone straight boy in Camp Ovation (handsome and talented, as he can sing). He's more than a pretty face, even though in reality, he was hired because he is handsome and has a body to die for. Shasha Allen as Dee and Tiffany Taylor as Joanna are brilliant finds, with voices of angels. Their preformances with chill you. Robin DeJesus displays a rare talent as a proud gay teen Michael who's only real dream is acceptence from his parents. The story is a bit cliched -even feeling at times like an old episode of Fame - and I wished almost that this could become a TV series as there are many story potentials. Things that disracted me was Don Dixon's Bert, a man who finds it difficult living in his own shadow and the Bud Miller sports director character that vanishes for no reason what so ever. I liked the film for many reasons, but mostlt for protraying gay teens in a very positive light. Even Vlad, while trying to understand Michael, seems to accept him with no issues. But over all, a fine debut for Graff and some star making performances from Allen and Taylor.",1079740800,,1658,4.386363636363637
1957014,1,B0000VV4MW,"Phew. It's over, I can leave the theatre and go home. My wife worked at Stage Door Manor, where this was filmed - when I visited her I saw loads of VERY talented kids and some excellent shows. None of them were present when this absolutely dreadful movie was made. The story, characters, situations etc all reek of cliche. The direction is slow and boring, the photography is stunningly bad (as is the acting) and the whole film a total mess.
The dialogue had me and most of the audience I was with in (unintentional) giggles and the the purile story (which we've all seen so many times before) was the final straw. Yes, the film is funny, but not on purpose. It's one of those ""so bad it's a must see"" movies.
My wife wanted the dvd (nostaligia value) so here we are. The thought of the extended and deleted scenes is terrifying!! There's more of the movie? Horror of horrors. I will not be viewing the dvd when it arrives.
Take my advice, ignore all the other reviews that like this turkey. They're mad. Watch any other movie instead - you'll be doing yourself the biggest favour ever.",1079222400,4,1087,4.44
1957015,4,B0000VV4MW,"What a great movie!  Sure, the production values are a bit lacking, but it's an indie.

The songs are very well sung, as well.",1078963200,,264,4.346938775510204
1957016,3,B0000VV4MW,"If watching a bunch of high-strung theatre star wannabes prancing around and hissing at one another is what you're in the mood for, ""Camp"" is made to order.  I happened to be in the mood for it, but even so found that it tested my patience.  For one thing, it's way too long for its subject matter.  For another thing, it's all over the place as far as plot goes, with no dramatic center to anchor the story.  O.k., I wasn't expecting ""Citizen Kane,"" (hell, I wasn't even expecting ""Legally Blonde""), but I do like my movies to be written with a modicum of competency.  ""Camp"" flounders from one scene to the next, sort of focusing on three principal characters but not really even doing that, climaxing in a flashy dance number that looks like the final scene from ""All That Jazz"" mixed with an episode of ""Star Search.""
What this movie is good for, however, are the musical numbers.  Seeing teenagers belt out songs from ""Follies"" and ""Company"" is admittedly fun.  And there are some life-affirming lessons about being true to yourself, etc., but these are even more diluted than your average after-school special.
There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but you might want to consider re-watching ""Fame"" instead.

1957019,2,B0000VV4MW,"This terrible film is about as entertaining as a second-year film student project. Which is not to say that it has NO entertainment value, just that it is very sporadic and scarce.
To portray these characters as ""real"" is a stretch of the imagination at best. With one notable exception- Stephen Sondheim as himself-, every character in this picture is about as stereotypical as can be. From the ""poor misunderstood homosexual"", to the ""nice girl who eveybody likes, but she somehow can't get the guy"", to the ""bitchy girl who treats everyone else like dirt"" to the ""hunky guy who, to everyone's surprise is not 100% perfect""...if they had been played any broader, they would have fallen into parody.
And none of these characters are really compelling enough to carry a storyline. But this doesn't seem to be much of a concern, as there really doesn't appear to be a central story to be found. Just a lot of disjointed sequences that are bound together by having a common setting.
The Show Numbers are decently staged for the most part, but there are so many R&B grooves that really have nothing to do with musical *theatre*, that I found them to be yet another distraction from what the film was trying to be...whcih I'm still trying to figure out.
If you are looking for another teenage angst picture, albeit in a decidedly different setting, then ""Camp"" is for you. If you are looking for originality and a compelling story, you'd be better off to save your money.",1078444800,,1467,4.712062256809339
1957020,5,B0000VV4MW,"I'm starting to believe that movies are made on a single scene that reaches into you and grabs you. If you find that scene, then the entire movie works for you. Such is true about the wonderfully charming movie, ""Camp"".
The scene for this movie is early on, in the school bus that's transporting the various drama wannabees to Camp Ovation for the summer. The kdis are singing a dramatic, compelling showstopper song as we pan down the center aisle of the bus. The camera stops on a young blond boy singing his heart out, sitting next to a man, who turns to the boy and says, ""Bud Miller: Sports Counselor"". The boy looks at the man incredulously and says, ""We have a SPORTS COUNSELOR?"".
Thus, this movie is made. Camp is a deliriously delightful romp with a bunch of multi-talents kids all spending their summer learning about the craft of acting, and the craft of life. Expected to perform a new show every two weeks, with a benefit at the end of the season seems ludicrous, but the kids pull it off, with great success.
This film has many hearts to it, mainly in the characters of Ellen, Vlad, and Michael. As they interact with each other, each character avoids the strereotypical traps many teenager films fall into, and lets these characters live and breathe. There's not a candy coated kids in this film, and thanks to an excellent script, and equally excellent acting from the kids, it all becomes believable.
The music is an intergral part to this movie, and somehow both propels the plot and supports it. I bought the CD the day after seeing the movie, and it still hasn't left my small collection of CDs I carry with me. I near tire of hearing some of the wonderful songs from the movie, including ""Century Plant"" and ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears"".
My boyfriend regularly puts me in his book reviews, so now I'll do the same. We both saw this movie together, twice, in a small theater just off Dupont Circle in Washington DC. I now cannot watch this impressive film without thinking of him.

If it wasn't for the language, and the fact that Vlad seems to sleep with just about everyone, I almost felt like I was watching one of those teen soaps they have on Noogin.  This isn't a bad thing, but it really never went as far as it could.  But even with that, I still had fun watching it, and got a kick out of some of the characters.  Also, the leads, Vlad included, are all very talented, and fun to watch.  I would say that this is perfect for the teen set, and it is, but because of the music, I have to say that any fan of musicals, especially modern ones like Hairspray, should check this out.

1957028,3,B0000VV4MW,"The word ""camp"" has a few different meanings, a couple of which are important to this film.  First, it comes to mean anything that is deliberately silly, making a blatant show of anything in an artificial yet somewhat humorous way.  The second is, of course, the place where kids go during their summers to participate in various activities, sometimes suited specifically for their talents and tastes (sports camp, dance camp, etc.)  The youngsters in Camp experience both. Their summer drama camp experiences are filled with teen crushes, touching (if a bit overbearing) friendships, and theatrical quarrels.  Though not without its flaws, it's a good film with a nice message regarding the ability for ""outsiders"" to make the most of their uniqueness and to heal their personal wounds through performance.

I mentioned that the film involved outsiders, and the featured Camp Ovation drama camp has a multitude of them.  The boys are gay, the girls are space cadets, and everyone is hopelessly star-struck (they squeal, gasp, and jump in the air upon spotting legendary playwright Stephen Sondheim).  The film has more than a few developed characters, but it really centers on three.  The first is Michael, who is openly gay and hasn't seen or heard from his parents in quite a long time (his father disapproves of his sexual orientation).  The second is Ellen, a tomboyish actress who listens almost entirely to showtunes and has zero dating experience.  The two of them have been coming to Camp Ovation for years, to show off their talents and to seek asylum from their dismal lives.  When Vlad, the third character, shows up for his first year, each of their lives takes an unexpected turn.  Vlad is seemingly ""perfect"": good-looking, congenial, musically talented, and Great Jumping Jehosaphat!-100% straight.  He forms a bond with Michael and sparks a romance with Ellen, but conflicts arise that threaten both of these relationships, all while trying to put together a concert and wading through camp life, mending as many personal rifts between him and others as he can.

I think it's pretty worthy of note that this is not a ""kids movie"", although I would venture to say that most kids would enjoy it (provided that their ages consist of more than a single digit).  Being an independent film, Camp is directed at older teens and adults, and one of the reasons this rings true is because the film is pretty quirky in its execution.  Take this as an example: the film alternates between stage performance and everyday life, but while the production is glossy during the performance numbers, it's stripped down during the real-life scenes, often opting for high contrast and a hand-held camera.  This was a smart move because it highlights the reality of camp life (which, surprisingly, has the capacity to be pretty harsh) and the relationships there.  The filmmakers could have given every scene a glossy, Hollywood-esque finish, and consequently make the film more palatable for kids and mainstream movie-going audiences, but doing that would likely downplay the realism essential to identifying with characters and making the story believable.  After all, the setting of the film is far from fantasy-most kids go to summer camp and some even go to drama camps much like Camp Ovation.  Therefore, it's quite important that what a viewer sees in this film is realistic and convincing.

While the production goes to some length to distinguish between glitzy performances and the scaled-down nature of the everyday, the characterization does not.  Their lives to some degree resemble campy performances, though they're not really aware that this transcendence actually happens (unlike Singin' in the Rain, whereby the characters strongly believe that all the world is a stage), which can make their offstage performances a bit grating.  This isn't to say that the acting is bad-far from it in fact, but acting can only work so much magic before the avatars show their flaws.  Though they're well into their teens, they display an unsightly mix of grade-school romantic immaturity and over-the-top emotions akin to soap opera characters, which makes them seem like people you might see on a romance-tinged episode of Saved by the Bell.  Sometimes, however, the relationships really work.  The best moments occur between Vlad and Michael, in which Vlad shows his ability to be sensitive and Michael in turn shows receptiveness to Vlad's gestures.

The soundtrack plays a large part in setting the tone of the film.  It mocks the technique used by the cinematographer by blasting lively pieces during stage performances and sprinkling gentle, acoustic rock songs on the realistic camp setting.  Again, a filmmaker could have slapped Mandy Moore onto those same scenes in order to appeal to a wider audience, but the effect would not have been so gorgeous as what we're given here.  It makes the setting and the characters in it seem warmer, gentler, and more real.

Finally, the message of the film is very satisfying because it holds some truth for the people who watch it.  All of us have felt like outsiders at one point or another-if not for what makes us ""weird"", then sometimes for what unique gifts we possess.  The characters in Camp have been shunned by a society that brands them as strange and, in the most severe cases, unacceptable.  Yet they gather together at Camp Ovation to celebrate their talents which have been unable to flourish in the society from which they came.  More importantly, their passion for the performing arts is given the chance to blossom, which builds their confidence and gives them euphoric pleasure.  Those who enjoy watching independent films such as Camp will feel this film calls to them, as their love of these kinds of films is generally unaccepted by a society that shows appreciation to big-budget blockbusters.  Thus, this film will most likely have a satiating effect on those who choose to see it.",1071187200,3,5950,5.028542303771662
