8156358,5,B000KG4BLS,I have always wanted to to to Carnival and see the sights.  I can never afford to go but this brought it right into the house and I felt like I was there,1402531200,,153,3.6363636363636362
8156359,2,B000KG4BLS,Bought this for a carnival themed party to use as footage to play on big screens but the quality was really terrible and it looks like its from the 70's. It is informative but randomly will show scenes that look like they come from a cheesy porn...it is informative and it explains how the carnival runs rules and such but it looks like an amatuer shot it and definitely not PG.,1324944000,,378,4.338028169014085
8156360,5,B000KG4BLS,"Although this DVD is from the 80s, it still captures the beauty of Rio's Carnaval. We attended in 2007 and the costumes are skimpier but the floats, costumes and music are as beautiful as ever. I wish GLOBO (TV Station) would ship DVDs more often. I borrowed a 2 disc set that came from Brazil and it was on the long side. This gives just enough viewing time without getting laborious.",1222819200,9,385,4.436619718309859
8156361,3,B000KG4BLS,"The music is, of course, great.
The commentary is informative and thankfully very brief.
However, the carnival is from 1986 and the video quality is very bad.
PS. Other than that, I agree with the ""wood Carver's"" comments.",1222041600,10,222,4.868421052631579
8156362,5,B000KG4BLS,"A comprehensive analysis of the carnaval participants is presented as a prelude to the parade. In doing so, one has a better understanding of the makeup of each group exhibiting. The parade itself was very well depicted with all its enthusiasum and glory.  I have witnessed the parade in person and this DVD very vividly recreated the color, pulse, and excitement of having been there. I recommend it to anyone wanting to witness people thoroughly enjoying their participation in the annual event
