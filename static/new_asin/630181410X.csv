7816321,4,630181410X,"When I first started working in a video store in the early '90s, I remember this being one of those lonely 'orphan' titles that languished at the bottom of the New Releases section for the longest time, and though I felt kind of sorry for it, the cover art just didn't really speak to me, and so I never took it home to check it out, though I WAS curious...

Flashforward some two-plus decades and I came across another VHS copy (apparently this is one of those late '80s/early '90s obscurities that still hasn't made the leap to the digital medium) in a sale bin at one of the few video rental stores still in business in my town (but for how much longer?). Of course, I had to pick it up (it was only a buck!) and now I finally had the time (and inclination) to actually sit down and watch it.

Well, call me pleasantly surprised. First off, the (long) opening scene features Amanda Plummer naked in a bathtub, periodically flashing just enough wet bosoms to lend the whole interchange with her husband (Christopher Rich - what ever happened to this guy?) a very tart erotic undertone that I never expected from Tim Roth's partner in crime in ""Pulp Fiction.""

The story then progresses in pleasant fits and starts, a sort of lazy Sunday gone awry, with the couple's adventures featuring such intriguing supporting players as John McGinley, Mark Boone Junior and Melinda Mullins, plus a German Shepherd with a small bladder. The couple's ever discursive peregrinations take them further and further from the comfort of their just-on-the-cusp-of-gentrification Greenwich Village neighborhood to the hinterlands of (*gasp!*) New Jersey...and back again.

Well, worth the trip. And the cost of the video.",1485561600,,1702,4.818493150684931

7816323,5,630181410X,"This is a perfect movie for those who want to imagine what could be without all of the responsibilities of life.  This couple just ""goes with the flow"" through their amazing adventures.  I've tried to watch it on the anniversary of my retirement for the past 7 years.",1356566400,,267,4.541666666666667
