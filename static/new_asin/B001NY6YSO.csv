3724493,4,B001NY6YSO,"This seemed to be more of a character study of a man nearing the end of a successful criminal career, at the expense of his family. After stealing something that will make him quite wealthy, he spends a lot of time in a park, on the phone, trying to get a buyer for it. As time goes on he notices the people in the park. The families and kids, the man feeding the pigeons, a little boy who seems to be following him whenever he is on the move. You can almost see the nostalgia and regret set in and that even with his successful ""career"" he's thinking ""Is that all there is?."" Although he tries to put the little boy off the kid gets to him anyway and he begins to care about him. The conversations with his ex wife take on an almost desperate tone as he tries to convince her to get back together and move to Florida to be near their daughter.
When he is near the families you can see the longing. The little boy lives in the park and tries to act street smart but he really wants a family. Johnny (Val Kilmer) tries a few times to reach his daughter and finally gets through to her and promises to come to Florida where she lives with her own family. There is some action in the film but it seems secondary to the main character. If you are into non-stop action and shoot im' ups this may be a little slow. If you are a Kilmer fan, you will appreciate his character.",1252540800,,1368,4.108208955223881

3724495,1,B001NY6YSO,"Definitely the worst movie viewed so-far this year.
Agree entirely with all the former comments, only to add my own disgust with the production values.
Shaky cameras obviously only included as it is a bit of a fad at present and split screens ugh! Much of Val Kilmers dialogue also very muffled when wearing an overcoat....Did this movie have an experienced Sound Team?
A story that relies on almost throughout, the actors engaged in telephone conversations over and over again.
I see ""Kilmer Films"" somewhere in the credits. Let's hope this fine actor keeps a much tighter lid on what the company does in the future.
I have managed to tick one star above and that is for the image quality. The pictures and film transfer are very good....That's it and only it!",1243814400,,761,4.7293233082706765
3724496,1,B001NY6YSO,"This movie was painful to watch. It was boring and stupid. Very low budget-but I guess Val Kilmer can't get work since ""Heat"". Could not even finish the movie. The idea of going back in forth in the movie to me was just a way to use up time. Terrible, Terrible Movie",1243296000,3,266,4.134615384615385
3724497,5,B001NY6YSO,"This is a story about a a thief (kind of a Santa Claus)...played well by DeCaprio, who befriends a small black boy in a park where he wants to exchange ""hot"" money for that which isn't, leaving the boy some of his loot.  The plot then takes many convoluted turns as the other bad guys try to kill him, shooting and wounding him before he can get back with his estranged wife and daughter.  However, his estranged wife takes him back and, though wounded, he successfully escapes in their car.  Very well done.",1242172800,,508,4.440860215053763
3724498,3,B001NY6YSO,"From the previews and the box, I believed this was a ""heist"" movie, or about a thief's last big score (like the Score with Edward Norton, or the Italian Job).

In fact, it was quite different. It's a ""real time"" movie - Val Kilmer plays a thief who is waiting in a park. He has just finished his score, and is waiting for the buyer.

Much of the movie is him on the phone, trying to locate the buyer (there is a small twist here), talking to his ex-wife, ex-girlfriend, and child on the phone. The other major focus is a little boy he meets at the park, and they form a unique relationship. And there are some flashbacks which tell us how he ended up in the park.

Overall, though, it's frustrating. First, I don't know who decided that  90 minutes of waiting in the park & talking on the phone could be exciting to watch. Second, Val Kilmer plays a dumb thief, whose personal life was in ruin. His partner (on the phone) apparently has a mental disability - and it doesn't make much sense. Not only is it hard to believe that a world class thief would have sub-par intelligence, it's painful to watch Kilmer play this role.

But most importantly, I wish these directors would understand the fatal flaws with making flashback movies - we already know that the main character survives the scene (shootout, double-cross, etc) if he's standing there narrating the flashback. So where's the suspense?

If you're a huge Val Kilmer fan, you might want to see this just for the sake of it. Also, there's a cameo by Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI/dp/B001CQONKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI</a>&nbsp;). Some of the scenes with the boy were mildly cute. But I can't think of too many good things to say about the film. The action here was sparse, the drama drags on ... it's all just a bit drab. Difficult and frustrating to watch.",1238025600,9,1911,4.793313069908814
8328281,5,B001NY6YSO,"Very good movie.  It's not an action movie if that's what you're looking for.  It's a movie about choices we've made, regrets we have and looking to our future happiness.",1446940800,,170,4.633333333333334
8328282,3,B001NY6YSO,"I bought this DVD because an actor, Michael Muhney, was in it. The film has problems with the screenplay. Val Kilmer walks with a suitcase to a lovely park in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles, California. There he befriends an African American boy named Antoine while he waits and makes phone calls to his ex wife Alice (played by Marg Helgenberger); his daughter in Florida; his girlfriend; and others.

This film has problems with the writing. I didn't understand what was going on aside from his friendship with Antoine and his ex wife Alice. The film leaves with unanswered questions about what happened.

Yes the film is low budget filmed entirely in Los Angeles, California. The DVD doesn't provide any extras. I have to say that Echo Park looks beautiful.",1422057600,,766,4.795454545454546
8328283,1,B001NY6YSO,"What an unwatchable pile of crap.  Val Kilmer should be issuing an apology to everyone who had to suffer through even one minute of this nonsense.  If you want to see a good Val Kilmer movie get ""The Saint"".",1363910400,,207,4.282051282051282
8328284,4,B001NY6YSO,Val Kilmer is good in any movie he stars in. I especially liked his interaction with the little boy. Good movie. I recommend this to others.,1360713600,,140,4.423076923076923
8328285,3,B001NY6YSO,Fairly good movie. Moves a bit slow at times. Some tender moments here and there between John and his daughter. Good movie to watch on a rainy day.,1328572800,,147,4.285714285714286
8328286,1,B001NY6YSO,"This was an awful movie. I kept hoping something--anything--would happen, but apparently good script writers don't work on Columbus Day. I watched it for what felt like an eternity but still nothing had happened, so I went and did something else. My wife, on the other hand, is a die-hard Val fan and powered through it. She also was on the edge of her seat expecting something to happen. She wasn't particularly impressed, but at least it didn't end with him still sitting in the park.",1326412800,,486,4.662790697674419
8328287,3,B001NY6YSO,"Disheartening to see how things have panned out for Val Kilmer. He was one of those top-tier acting studs that seemed destined to be the Robert Redford of his generation. Not the guy stuck doing low-budget action vids to make a buck. I'm not even sure what happened to bring down one of the huge stars of the 90's? Hadn't heard anything beyond the typical ""creative actor"" label, so it's a mystery why the performer who floored audiences with his portrayal of Jim Morrison in 'The Doors' and headlined blockbusters like 'Heat' and 'The Saint', would be doing a gamut of direct-to-video schlock just a few years later. Very curious indeed.

But the core talent that Kilmer utilized to reach those heights also carries his performances in productions like 'Columbus Day' and outstanding sleepers like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartan/dp/B00022XE6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartan</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Kiss-Bang-Bang/dp/B000F5GNX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang</a>"" and the acting tour de force of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felon/dp/B001AK3S4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felon</a>"".

In 'Day' he plays John Cologne, a thief who has gotten ahold of a very valuable item, said item belonging to one of the city's meanest hardcore gangsters. His plan: Ransom the item, get paid, take his best friend and his best girl and find a new life somewhere else.

Interestingly, the plot takes a quirky twist with the introduction of Antoine, a 10-year old smartass kid who quickly attaches himself to the trenchcoat man that he correctly surmises is hiding a big secret. Cologne also makes an accurate read on the hall-pint dude: That, despite fronting himself as a slick streetwise hustler, Antoine is actually a sensitive lonely little guy. These two form a friendship over the course of the holiday afternoon - Cologne begrudgingly becoming confidant, friend and ersatz father figure to the youngster.

Most of the film is shot in Echo Park and incidents explaining his presence there are shown in flashback. Not an unpleasant delivery for the movie; often a red caution light goes on when I learn that a filmmaker will execute their project via 'many flashback sequences'. If done correctly, it can be an effective tool to tell a story.

Not quite a full-fledged thriller, it still has enough oomph to carry the plot along at a brisk pace without getting bogged down. My only issue is how the film ended - vague. The uncertainty seems a bit of a copout, too arthouse trendy for the straight-forward storytelling of the screenplay.* But that minor criticism aside, a decent rental and worth the time spent.

*Note: I wrote that before learning the fascinating history of this film. There is, and this depends greatly on how you view the business end of filmmaking, either an ""interesting"" or a ""despicable"" backstory to Columbus Day.

The movie was originally shot as an indie character drama with very little in terms of action sequences. However, in an attempt to recoup their financial investment, the producers (including Kevin Spacey) decided to sell the rights to a distributor known for recutting and re-filming projects to better fit the marketplace. The director and all the principal actors disavowed the project after the distributor started re-editing the film and adding scenes that were only hinted at in the original screenplay. Kilmer was so disgusted - he refused to do the re-shoots and a body double was used for the flashbacks sequences.

Which explains, at least from my perspective, why the film's ending seemed so off-putting and oddly paced. There are two completely different versions of Columbus Day available to film fans - the arthouse indie and the action/thriller.

The download version which I reviewed, and offered thru content providers like Amazon, is the action/thriller.",1308528000,,3968,5.5131578947368425
