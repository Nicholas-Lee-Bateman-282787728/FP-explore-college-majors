3863007,3,B0027AN26U,The message was good but the acting was jus OK. I would say to get it so you can enjoy the story but not if you are picky about quality acting.,1354924800,,143,3.6451612903225805
3863008,2,B0027AN26U,"If you were thinking about buying this play, save your money because it isn't worth it. The story was choppy and didn't flow well and some of the acting was horrible. If I could return this movie I would.",1353888000,,204,4.256410256410256
3863009,2,B0027AN26U,"The previews looked really good..Instead, I was watching a bad tv series.  It had a live audience, slow, I thought it was suppose to be a movie.

3863013,3,B0027AN26U,"I have watched this a couple of times now, and it grows on you ... LOL.  The meaning behind the message was good.  Clifton Powell is really showing up ALL over the place these days.  I do wish that instead of trying to imitate what we have already seen (with other writers), maybe they should work on being authentic with story lines and characters.  It should have had more singing or just none at all.  It was just okay for me.",1339804800,,429,4.246913580246914
3863014,3,B0027AN26U,"One Village Entertainment, a division of Image Entertainment, released the 90 minute musical stage production, She's Not Our Sister, on DVD.  Directed by Snoop Robinson and written by Johnnie Johnson, She's Not Our Sister has a recognizable cast that includes Kellita Smith (The Bernie Mac Show), Drew Sidora (The Game), Azur-De (Somebody Help Me 2), Christian Keyes (Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail), Clifton Powell (Ray), Tony Grant (Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?), and Jazsmin Lewis (Tyler Perry's Meet The Browns).  She's Not Our Sister was later adapted into the GMC TV (Gospel Music Channel) series, She's Still Not Our Sister.

The story is about three sisters who are informed at the reading of their deceased father's will very surprising revelations. First, the good news is that their father leaves a million dollar fortune.  How could this be when their father struggled financially? The will explains that the father properly invested the proceeds of an insurance policy resulting from their mother's death.  The news of becoming millionaires gradually goes downhill when they learn of a fourth heir to the estate.  Their father apologizes in the will about an affair he had when married to their mother, and a child resulting from that affair.  Third, their father conditions receipt of the inheritance on all four sisters living in the same home for six months to bond and become a closer family. Finally, if the sisters don't comply, the entire fortune goes to the local SPCA. It's an all or nothing provision. Predictably, the sisters are stunned and shocked.

The oldest sister (Kellita Smith) is stubbornly bitter about her father's betrayal of their mother especially when she learns the ""new"" sister (Jazsmin Lewis) is only months apart from her as to birth date and is biracial. The younger sister (Azur De) was least resistant to the ""new"" sister, if not welcoming. The middle sister (Drew Sidora) appeared indifferent because her only concern was complying to the will conditions in order to become a millionaire. The story continues as each sister grieves differently and interacts with their ""new"" sister in the house.  In the end, all of the sisters come to terms with their family dysfunction and they don't have to wait the entire six months to get the inheritance.

A few drawbacks for this production were that for each comedic punch line, there is a distracting and dated laugh tract, there was uneven transitioning from one scene to another, and the singing seems haphazard, not blending properly with the dialogue between characters.  The positive about the production is that the cast made an otherwise trite tale become spirited and colorful.",1336780800,11,2686,5.081818181818182
3863015,4,B0027AN26U,"This is an apparently made for TV movie shot in a studio and utilizing an annoying laugh track. Three sisters are at home after their father has died. Deniece [sic] (Azur-De) is the youngest of the three. She is the only one who is grieving. She is kind and sweet and favors her mother who died 15 years ago. Vivian (Kelita Smith) is the oldest of the three. She takes after her dad. She is almost emotionless about the death. Cynthia (Drew Sidora) is the middle child. She is independent and is overly proud to be a ""black woman"" or ""Nubian queen.""

The movie starts out with a lot of dialouge so we can get to know the the three main characters, although most of what we learn about them is from what the other sister says about them. Sha Wheaton plays Aunt Connie who is always looking for a man.

At the reading of the will, they discover Dad had a fourth illegitimate, bi-racial daughter (Jazsmin ""cleavage"" Lewis) and a will that leaves them 4 million dollars to split. But of course they have to do the inane thing such as live together as a family for 6 months. Vivian is vehemently opposed to the idea, although bowing out would cost her her share which would literally go to the dogs.

The whole problem with this film is that this is a 1980's sitcom with 2012 dialouge and a 1950's laugh track. The acting is a bit over done and the singing appears to be lip synced also.  If you love 80's sit-coms or enjoy the banter of 3 sisters/ 4 sisters ribbing on each other, with things being a little spiritual, some music, with a heart warming ending, check it out.

No offensive language, gangsters, rap, hip-hop, or negative stereotypes.  3 1/2 stars",1336176000,10,1656,4.413114754098361

3863032,5,B0027AN26U,"A highly erotic and compelling film based upon the work Justine (or The Misfortunes of Virtue)a classic 1791 novel by Donatien Alphonse Franois de Sade, better known as the Marquis de Sade, played by Klaus Kinski, while imprisoned in the Bastille.
Justine is a sweet,virtuous young girl living with her sister Juliette in a nunnery. Learning of their father's death, they are thrown out of the nunnery with their father's remaining gold.
The film follows Justine through harrowing adventures of perversion and defilement that threaten her virginity as well as her virtue. Mad monks (portrayed by a wildly enthusiastic and sadistic Jack Palance) Murderous nobles, a salacious acting troupe she finally is reunited with her sister.
As with any older film much must be forgiven, the dubbed English is obvious, teh sets and lighting ar every dated to the 60's motif, but this adds to the films charm if one appreciates the early European stylings that were apparent in films like Susperia and other films by Dario Argento, Fellini etc.",1357344000,,1031,5.070588235294117
