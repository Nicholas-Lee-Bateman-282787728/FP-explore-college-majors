7548424,5,B018HEW22Y,What a wonderful story about the life of Flannery O'Connor. I hadn't read any of her writing prior to seeing the film and now I am completely fascinated with Ms. O'Connor and her works. This film contains many photos from her life and even a news reel video from her childhood. This is a comprehensive view of her life and circumstances and delves into the effect it had on her writing.,1450310400,2,386,4.450704225352113
7548425,5,B018HEW22Y,"I was somewhat familiar with the work of Flannery O'Connor, but knew nothing of her life story.  This film did a beautiful job of highlighting her upbringing and early prowess, as well as her growth and development into an influential figure in American literature.  Well-told story about a fascinating figure. Would be a great asset to high school or college English curriculum, too!",1449878400,2,384,5.079365079365079
7548426,5,B018HEW22Y,"Few authors pioneer new literary genres, and Uncommon Grace explores the life and influences of Flannery O'Connor, one of the few American authors to change the landscape of literature.  From her Southern upbringing to her Catholic faith to her struggle with a debilitating disease, Uncommon Grace explores the events and experiences which shaped her view of the world, and ultimately, her writing.  Those wishing to understand the perspective from which Flannery O'Connor writes would do well to have a copy of Uncommon Grace.",1449878400,2,527,5.337349397590361
7548427,5,B018HEW22Y,I have always been a Flannery O'Connor fan and was searching for some more information on her. I was fortunate enough to stumble upon this recently and was so glad I did. This film tells the story of her life in a way that is informative and interesting. I was so glad I was able to find this and learn more about this celebrated American author.,1449446400,6,346,4.257575757575758
7548428,5,B018HEW22Y,I did not know much about Flannery O'Connor but had wanted to read her stories for many years. I am also a high school English teacher and hoped to find noteworthy historical information to share with my students prior to teaching O'Connor. The film was definitely beneficial! It is a mix of both her personal life and her writing path. I am eager to share this DVD with my students and it also made me better appreciate the craft of Flannery O'Connor.,1470009600,,452,4.524390243902439
7548429,5,B018HEW22Y,"If you're a fan of Flannery's work, you need this documentary. It is the first film to thoroughly explore her life and writing. Bridget and Daniel, the makers of the film, have done a wonderful job of conveying who Flannery was and what compelled her to write. Kudos to them for bringing us such a well-made and well-researched piece of work. The documentary tells us a lot about Flannery the person and where she derived the inspiration for her utterly unique and haunting stories. (Her two great novels are also discussed in detail.) Do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of this fine film.",1467936000,,594,4.613207547169812
7548430,5,B018HEW22Y,"O'Connor's Catholic faith takes a front-row seat in this film, as does the Middle Georgia farm where she spent her final years and did much of her best writing.
The filmmakers reveal the connections between O'Connor's childhood, family tragedy, illness, and personal struggle, and the impact these diverse influences have on the author's work. Woven in between surprising nuggets--like the fact that O'Connor's college writing professor was so befuddled by the future author's Southern accent that he had to ask her to write down what she was saying so he could understand it--are deep insights into how O'Connor's life influenced her art.
With a multitude of images of O'Connor at various stages in her short life, and commentary from noted biographers and literary experts, this film is a must-see for O'Connor fans and lovers of literature in general.",1466899200,2,854,5.195652173913044
7548431,5,B018HEW22Y,Lots of photos included here that I'd never seen before. The film does a good job with O'Connor's biography. Very much worth watching whether you're an O'Connor aficionado or you're looking for an introduction to the author and her work.,1461628800,4,237,4.95

7548433,5,B018HEW22Y,"This film is a MUST SEE for any Flannery O'Connor fan. I gave it as a gift to my mom who teaches English literature, and because of the everything new she learned in the film, she just reread Flannery O'Connor's The Complete Stories. After watching the film twice (once was not enough!), I myself now have a greater appreciation of Flannery's work and perspective -- very enlightening, esp. about how her Catholic faith influenced her stories. The film is very well done, with great interviews and featuring some rare pictures.",1454630400,3,527,4.866666666666666

I highly recommend this video if you are, or want to be, a Flannery O'Connor fan.",1452470400,4,338,4.947368421052632
7548435,5,B018HEW22Y,Excellent and moving biography. Wonderfully done. Received order promptly too!,1451952000,2,78,6.9
7548436,5,B018HEW22Y,"Oh my goodness, I honestly don't know where to begin. I received this short documentary film as a Christmas gift and just finished watching it. It is just SUPERBLY done. Six or seven Flannery O'Connor experts are regularly consulted throughout the film to provide a complete picture of Ms. O'Connor and her work. The cinematography and scene selection are to the highest professional standards. The narration, done by Bridget Kurt, is simply impeccable. She speaks with clarity and brevity, giving copious amounts of information in a clear, concise manner. I will certainly watch this film again and again. I feel like I have just taken a semester-long course in the life and works of Flannery O'Connor. There is just so much there to digest.

What else? As good or better than the superb narration is the...MUSIC. The soundtrack of this film is just STUNNING. No other word for it. Along with Ms. Kurt's crisp narration, the soundtrack carries the film from start to finish. Flannery O'Connor's short life of just 39 years was marked by suffering, both physical and emotional, which she bore heroically. The soundtrack conveys precisely the right tone for a film about her life: certainly not melancholic, because her deep Catholic faith would have precluded such a lack of hope. But still...pensive, without being morose. Still serious-minded and even sorrowful. And the music captures all of that perfectly, in my opinion. I finished the film with a lump in my throat, frankly. It's that good.

If you are a fan in any way of American Literature in general or of Flannery O'Connor in particular, get this DVD. I guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy it. This film comes with my highest recommendation. I loved it.",1451001600,17,1714,4.968641114982578
7548437,4,B018HEW22Y,"I am not aware of any other documentary on O'Connor, which seems strange as she is clearly one of the elite American writers of the 20th Century.  This doc is really nicely told and provides a lot of insight into the forces that drove O'Connor's writing. The film is slickly produced and has a lot of great photos. A must watch for Flannery fans and well worth the time of any lover of literature. Just wish it were longer.",1450828800,,423,4.3544303797468356
8742334,5,B018HEW22Y,"An achievement. Flannery O'Connor, a Southern writer from 1950s America forms the focus of this astute film. Flannery (or Mary as was her given name) wrote with an immediacy to her own cultural milieu of the deep south. But she was possessed with a remarkable and perhaps singular faith that understood, working from humble observations of her own soul, that  all human societies have issues and concerns. Rather than packing up her bags and going north, or escaping to the cities and towns, she embraced the human burden exactly where she was. This film traces Flannery's career as a  writer through succinct comments by leading O'Connor critics - many of who were her friends - and through a well-paced and rounded narrative and commentary. Flannery knew and responded to the postmodern world way before the term ever became popular, and she understood and put forth a vision rooted in the Catholic Church that was at once nuanced, intelligent and real, and which also responded to this world. If she was around today - a time in which her legacy is ever-deepening; deepening just as she would her images that evoked the redemptive mystery of all life - I reckon she would be pleased to see that her insights and  outstanding faith continue to bear good fruit. Flannery, though a local writer, was able to set forth a seering theological vision through the medium of story that contained universal truths. This film is well worth getting a copy of as it brings us into the same ambit, cultural velour and within the crucial mystery that formed the heart of Flannery's corpus. Well done and thanks.",1522713600,,1599,4.828467153284672
8742335,5,B018HEW22Y,"For anyone who asks what life is all about, who questions if God is real, who thinks because life is hard that it has little meaning, Flannery O'Connor is the anecdote. If you are a reader and have come across the short stories or novels of Flannery O'Connor and found them horrifyingly mystifying, this DVD will provide insight (and comfort). I fell in love with Flannery through her short stories that first appeared in The New Yorker. I read her collected letters (""The Habit of Being"") as a young adult. They brightened my world and helped me develop empathy. My understanding of what grace truly is blossomed after reading ""Mystery and Manners."" This DVD will cause you to want to read everything Flannery ever wrote. It is as well done as any Ken Burns production!",1506384000,3,770,4.711111111111111
8742336,5,B018HEW22Y,Important American writer---nice work to capture her life and contributions.,1491091200,,76,6.7
8742337,5,B018HEW22Y,The documentary was very educational. I really enjoyed it.,1491091200,,58,5.555555555555555
8742338,5,B018HEW22Y,This film is a great introduction to the life of an amazing American Southern writer. It covers her early life as well as the progression of her writing career. I was quite moved by the discussion of her lupus. The film contains a lot of information but moves at a quick pace. I enjoyed the female narration and the music. A very useful film for classroom teaching.,1491004800,,365,4.462686567164179
8742339,2,B018HEW22Y,Content is strong but the narration is so unprofessional and irritating that it is hard to get through.  Read like a middle school book report.,1490227200,,143,4.72
8742340,4,B018HEW22Y,"I confess; I don't always 'get' O'Connor.  I suppose that reflects a lack of intellectual prowess or sophistication on my part.  I did, however, enjoy this documentary. I have had the pleasure of visiting her home in Savannah, and would recommend you stop there if you ever have a chance.  Without a doubt, she was a brilliant, gifted, and insightful and most intriguing person, who faced supreme challenges with great courage and grace.  If you enjoy her work, you will like this brief overview and explanation of her sadly all too brief time here on earth.",1483747200,,558,4.78125
8742341,5,B018HEW22Y,"Excellent Documentary. Kudos to Beata Production. Excellent service, a good product, and very understanding and professional people working for Beata. Overall, excellent company and good product.",1477958400,,195,6.538461538461538
8742342,5,B018HEW22Y,"Flannery OConnors introduction to A Memoir of Mary Ann begins with the statement, Stories of pious children tend to be false.  But what about stories of pious authors?  Uncommon Grace tells the story of OConnors life and pietyall without resorting to sentimentality, mawkishness, or irony.  The film takes OConnor at her word and, wonderfully, takes her faith seriously, as the force that informed her art.
I had assumed that I knew all there was to know about OConnors life and was not surprised to find the backwards-walking-chicken, the cartoons about the WAVES, and the story of Paul Engles inability to understand her drawl included in the film.  I had also assumed that I had seen every photograph of OConnor: every pose on her porch, every awkward glance, every pursed-lips stare.
I was half-wrongwonderfully soon the first count and wholly wrong on the second.  I knew that OConnor revered her father, Edward, but Uncommon Grace reminded me, through its skillful use of a photograph and narration, of the depth of their relationship.  Each adored the other.  And I knew that the view from Andalusias porch inspired the ways in which OConnor described the sun and treeline in so many of her works, but seeing it on film made me nod and think, Thats exactly right.  As for the photographs, never before had I seen one of her among a brace of ducks.
The director, Bridget Kurt, wisely avoids tackling all of OConnors works.  While the mention of Parkers Back, for example, made me hope for some discussion of that terrific story, I knew that to treat all of OConnors works would only lead to superficial observations.  Instead, Kurt opts for introducing Hazel Motes as OConnors archetypical character whose fingerprints are found on Hulga, Rayber, Mr. Head, and many others; she then treats A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Good Country People.  Her choice of speakers is also sharp: the late William Sessions speaks of the Prayer Journal, biographer Brad Gooch talks about OConnors home appearing in her stories, and professor David King provides sensible literary insights.
More impressive than the literary treatment is the way in which Kurt tells the story of OConnors illness and death.  Nothing could have been easier, or perhaps more expected, than to turn OConnors battle with lupus into an occasion for sentimental slow-pans of photos accompanied by soft piano music.  OConnor would have hated such an approach.  Writing to Maryat Lee in 1960, OConnor fumed, I don't want further attention called to myself in this way.  My lupus has no business in literary considerations. The occasion was a review in Time of A Good Man Is Hard to Find which described her as a bookish spinster and one whose suffering would have seemed to prevent her from writing.  Uncommon Grace instead presents OConnor as an artist imbued with the quality mentioned in the films title.  Anyone who sees it and doesnt know OConnors work will be provoked into reading it; anyone deeply familiar with OConnors work will be reminded of why he or she was drawn to it in the first place.",1475452800,,3066,4.888030888030888
8742343,4,B018HEW22Y,"I learned some things I did not know which is why I purchased this. I wish it was a two hour documentary instead of a one hour. I enjoyed it and thought it was well done. I liked it very much, I just wish it was longer and more comprehensive.",1470787200,2,242,3.86
