It's just too bad--looks like it would be a good movie",1522022400,,168,4.633333333333334

8232614,1,B000YFDP9O,This is dubbed into Italian with only Italian subtitles. It's a really good film but unless you can speak Italian you will be out of luck with this copy. I was lucky enough to see it when it was still available in the original English on VHS. To bad it isn't available in the original on DVD.,1485475200,,292,4.140350877192983
8232615,2,B000YFDP9O,"The film looks beautiful and it's fun seeing Elizabeth Taylor sing Aida. Unfortunately, I purchased this from a vendor who failed to mention that the film is dubbed into Italian with no subtitles. I can understand Italian, but I would have preferred a subtitled or dubbed film.",1470268800,,277,4.914893617021277

8232618,4,B000YFDP9O,I've just seen the big dramatic scene when the young Toscanini suddenly substitutes as conductor for the performance.  It is all spoken in English as Elizabeth speaks to the audience about slavery ll  I don't know where this copy comes from and why its not available to the public but I saw it on an ARTS's channel which one sees on certain public stations.  Where is the English version?,1396137600,,388,4.594202898550725
8232619,5,B000YFDP9O,Very good. Rare stuff filmography of actress Elizabeth taylor difficult to achieve in Brazil. I was very pleased with this acquisition. worth it.,1394841600,,145,5.3478260869565215
8232620,4,B000YFDP9O,"I've been intrigued by this movie for the past 20 yrs. Why was it never released (officially, here in the States)? I'd read how it had been booed, when it played the Cannes Film Festival, and immediately got yanked from distribution. I figured the movie must really have stunk - but that it would be released whenever the unfortunate day came when Elizabeth Taylor passed away. Well... that day came - and the movie still sits, locked away somewhere... I finally saw the movie - and much to my surprise... it did NOT stink(!)... Not a great film, by any means - but nothing to be ashamed of. No reason for it to have been booed.

Elizabeth Taylor, in this - her final movie - is beautiful. (If only she had looked like this in A Little Night Music!) Her performance isn't necessarily consistent (within itself - or the other actors)... for instance, nearly everyone in the movie speaks with accents of some kind or another. Taylor is playing a Russian soprano - and yet, she's the only actor in the movie who doesn't seem to show any attempt at an accent (other than her normal slightly British/slightly American accent)... That part bothered me. BUT... as all Taylor fans know, in every movie (good or bad), the lady gives us at least one golden moment... and this movie has several truly golden moments. She is surprisingly good, lip-syncing opera(!) - who would've guessed?!? Her rehearsal scene (with the entire cast & orchestra) is wonderful. She is stunning, she lip-syncs great, and acts well. That scene is priceless.

One reviewer on Amazon.com found it campy that Taylor seems so ""out of it"" or ""dazed"" during the Aida scene - but, there's a reason for it. The plot of the movie calls for it - and she does that scene beautifully, too.

C. Thomas Howell is enjoyable to watch - nice acting, and nice looking, too. Sophie Ward is beautiful - subtle, delicate. Pat Heywood was also wonderful to watch.

Major problem w. the movie is that not much really happens. It's a pretty film - with great classical music - and beautiful looking people in it.

Regardless of the lack of plot/action, though, this movie didn't deserve to not be released. It's not a great movie - but it has merit, and we should be able to see it for what it is... (and, above all, appreciate Elizabeth Taylor's final film performance... glamour, right up to the end!)",1368403200,8,2347,4.618705035971223
8232621,5,B000YFDP9O,"This is a wonderful film, how can you lose with Dame Elizabeth and the brilliant Franco. I have the DVD, but it's all in Italian.
 I wish somday it'll be released in English, then I can review it again. Or maybe I'll just learn Italian.
