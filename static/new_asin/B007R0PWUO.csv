5105060,5,B007R0PWUO,"A well done DVD documentary outlining the life of Mary Pickford and establishing why she was considered America's Sweetheart.  The program is filmed well, and has done a very good job with the addition of many interviews of friends and associates of Miss Pickford along with many film clips from the many films she made during her very monumental career.

An interesting section on the loss of her home in Beverly Hills, California (Pickfair) is a sad reminder as to why Cities need appropriate standards for maintaining homes and buildings that have Historical significance.  Pickfair was known at the time as the White House of the West Coast due to the many dignitaries that were entertained there during the time Miss Pickford owned the home.  Highly recommended for those interested in learning of the Pioneers of early silent film in Hollywood during the teens and twenties of the last century.",1369267200,4,900,4.98
5105061,5,B007R0PWUO,"I have watched this documentary three times and every time reveals a new, deeper understanding of this female pioneer of the movies. The story of how this ambitious woman saw opportunities where others missed them should be an inspiration for all budding entrepreneurs. I especially enjoy watching her facial expressions as she is acting in the silent films.",1368057600,2,358,5.189655172413793
5105062,5,B007R0PWUO,This is a top-notch video.  Superbly produced and presented.  So much of it narrated by Mary Pickford herself.  I love it.,1366675200,2,122,4.714285714285714
5105063,5,B007R0PWUO,"Mary Pickford is one of my absolute favorite stars ever. Her sweetness on screen, her immense talent both in front of and behind the camera, her beauty, and her intelligence have captured me completely. I think of her the way people think of comfort food, and refer to her as ""My Mary."" She was an incredibly important cog in the machine of early Hollywood, and this documentary explains her place in history through her words, interviews with colleagues, narration, and film segments.

What I love most about this documentary is that unlike the others I've seen (Milestone's release and PBS's release), this one isn't horribly depressing at the end, and it is told through Mary's own words which lead you to believe that she was intensely spiritual and therefore had hope even in the darkest times.

This film is unique too in its use of film clips, some of which I've never seen before. I was impressed by the clip of D.W. Griffith directing a scene and also by the cut scene with an angel from Sparrows, which I didn't even know existed. Perhaps most impressive is the clip of an interview with Roxanne, Mary's adopted daughter. For years I have wondered what happened to the children, having not heard much about them except that they existed and might not have had a good relationship with their mother. I still pine for information, but that brief glimpse satisfied my thirst for information at least partly.",1359244800,3,1414,4.7673469387755105
5105064,5,B007R0PWUO,"Yes, really. Mary Pickford was not only an actress in films (both silent and sound) for 25 years, but she co-founded United Artists, developed camera techniques like ""face lighting"", supported women in strong roles and even convinced Sid Grauman to have stars put their hands and feet in concrete in front of his Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

There are probably other bios of Pickford out there but none as unique as this 101-minute one. Why, because - through creative editing - Pickford (who died in 1979) actually co-narrates the film. Director/Producer Nicholas Eliopoulos - who has made a career as Editor on such mega-hits as ""Out of Africa"" and ""9 to 5"", spent more than 10 years assembling over 18 hours (!) of audio interviews that Pickford gave to both the BBC and the UCLA Oral History project (going so far as to adjust the pitch of her voice so it would flow easily) and rare footage and stills of her career. He then got his ""friend"", actor Michael York, to add additional narration. The quality of the prints and the ""look"" of this documentary are superb.

The DVD adds a few helpful bonues too: There are text bios of all the important people mentuoned in the film (husbands Douglas Fairbanks Sr and Buddy Rogers, Charlie Chaplin, Lillian Gish ansd more), a Photo Gallery with 23 images and two interviews with the Director. The first of these (15 minutes) is from the Q&A from the 2011 Toronto Film Festival (Pickford was born in Toronto) which add some new info. The second (also 15 minutes) is the audio of a radio show interview from 2011 on a New Mexico radio station.

This is a must see film for anyone interested in motion picture history. And, I'm certain will spark a revival in rentals of Pickford's films.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5105065,5,B007R0PWUO,"This dvd is a must for any Pickford fan.  It consists of Mary telling her life story, culled from several audio interviews.  This is combined with footage from her films as well as other archival footage as well as those who knew Mary including Buddy Rogers, Lillian Gish, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, and Adolph Zukor. It is well done and one of the best documentaries I've seen in quite some time.",1349481600,5,392,4.585714285714285
5105066,5,B007R0PWUO,"I have read a lot on Mary Pickford, but this gave me a new viewpoint.  Of especial interest was the interviews with her husband, which were amazingly high quality.  I wasn't expecting that, especially knowing the background of her leaving Fairbanks/etc ... seeing his viewpoint and personality was very interesting.  I couldn't imagine a female in the film industry not watching this as a source of history and inspiration.",1347148800,2,423,5.101449275362318
5105067,4,B007R0PWUO,"Mary Pickford:Muse of the Movies is a 2008 documentary,released now to home video. It tells the story  of the life and career of the most influential star that has ever appeared on film.....period. It is narrated by Michael York with bridging sound clips from Mary herself throughout.
There are two falsehoods being touted by other reviewers(whom I usually ignore),but in this instance felt compelled to rectify. First off it is said Mary is narrating the film herself. No. As I just said the prime narration is by Mr. York. They interject various sound bites from interviews done with Mary over many years to bring a more immediacy to it all. And it works wonderfully. Secondly,it is said that a good portion of the film is religious in nature. Nothing could be further from the truth. Towards the end there are some very short sound bites in which Mary waxes philosophically about the world,God and our place in the grand scheme of things,but nothing major. She was after all Catholic and she did write a religious book,so not to include at least a thought or two on her views would be negligence on the producers part. But,as I say,they are short and take up a miniscule part of the entire documentary.
The only fault I can find was the length. It comes in around 101 minutes and it has a tendency to drag in parts.
There are some extras also which include a photo gallery and an audio dissertation on Mary,among others.
All in all a good documentary on Ms. Pickford and her rise in filmdom. As it says in the DVD,her rise parallels the rise of the movies themselves,so this is important stuff for those novices wanting to learn more about early film and the important movers and shakers of the day. For the more seasoned and informed,this documentary is a feast for the eyes, as it contains some rare clips of Mary from her movies and elsewhere. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1434672000,,1864,4.6314199395770395
5105068,5,B007R0PWUO,"One of the best biography documentaries ever done.  Great example of how to honor the legend and beauty that was Mary Pickford. This is a must see, must own video for any lover of cinema history. Mary Pickford was the very definition of star.",1433116800,,242,4.5

5105070,5,B007R0PWUO,"I can't say enough about this film. America's Sweetheart comes to life for a new generation with this informative and beautifully produced documentary. The research that went into this project is truly remarkable. My favorite clip is the one of Amelia Earhart's visit to Pickfair, her interview with Ms. Pickford, and the mutual respect and admiration we see between these two pioneering women.

The producers also include behind-the-scenes clips and stills showing the camaraderie between Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin on set and off at the height of their careers.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. tells a really interesting story towards the end of the film about the ""artistic differences"" that eventually separated the mega-stars and the creative plan he devised to bring the old friends back together.

This documentary is a great introduction to the world of early film. Very highly recommended.",1422662400,,915,5.384615384615385
5105071,5,B007R0PWUO,A wonderful glimpse into the birth of Hollywood and the first great film star who shaped the industry. Beautifully written and produced. Excellent quality.,1421625600,,155,5.5
5105072,5,B007R0PWUO,"The DVD was better than I had expected and many Pickford fans will enjoy this documentary.
The documentary spoke about many interesting details about Mary that are not often mentioned in other pickford related biographies. It included rare photographs,  never before seen footages in movie studios and out of work locations, there was a beautiful song performed at the begining and the end of the documentary, interviews from other friends such as Lillian Gish, Buddy Rogers, Adolf Zukor and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., there discussions of events that Mary took part in such as war services, charity projects and helping other film makers like Walt Disney and half the documentary was narrated by Mary pickford herself as well as Mr. York.",1412294400,,735,5.125
5105073,5,B007R0PWUO,"I have always loved Mary, and now I have a movie that summarizes her career.  I was walking around Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, CA about 15 years ago, and I peeked over a stone wall - lo and behold there was the headstone of Mary Pickford a few yards in the distance.  I will never forget the feeling I had when I saw that, and was happy and sad simultaneously!  She will always remain in my heart!  I love you, Mary, and I will never stop.",1394928000,2,445,4.080459770114943
5105074,5,B007R0PWUO,"So far this is the best Mary Pickford documentary I've seen and I've researched her biography for years...
It goes in a lot more detail than the PBS special did and has a lot of the narration by Mary herself...
If you want to research not just Mary but filmmaking in it's infancy and learn about all the supporting players in her life...
This is a really through doc to watch...
And the PBS doc is also good...",1389657600,2,410,4.269230769230769
5105075,3,B007R0PWUO,"The first hour of this documentary is excellent. It was a brilliant stroke to use splices of earlier audio-interviews to make Pickford the seeming narrator of a film about her own life. But as a film-buff, I'm interested in Miss Pickford's movies, not her religious views. During the last third of this film, we are treated at least 15 or 20 minutes of soaring strings accompanying film-clips of clouds while we're told about Mary's profound ""spirituality."" I thought for a moment I had accidentally clicked on THE 700 CLUB! When I watch a documentary about a film-personality, I want to learn as much as possible about their FILMS.  It only takes one sentence and minute or two to tell us that she was very religious. Personally, I would have appreciated seeing more clips from her films...especially since none of Pickford's films retain the stature (or familiarity) of film classics like BIRTH OF A NATION, THE GOLD RUSH or METROPOLIS.

Lots of contemporary documentariies have clear political or social agendas. But I felt like this one betrayed it's primary goal of documenting an important star's film career by wasting valuable time veering off the subject. Bottom line: It wasn't Mary Pickford's faith that made her ""The Muse of the Movies.""",1381795200,9,1249,4.971291866028708
5105076,5,B007R0PWUO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. The never-before-released footage and soundtrack with recordings of Mary's own voice woven into the story made it just riveting. This is a great piece of work for both movie buffs and fans of Mary Pickford! Eliopoulos has done a fantastic job, can't wait to see more by him!",1377216000,,313,4.9245283018867925
8521129,5,B007R0PWUO,"For those who don't know, the foundations of the film industry are beautifully described in this documentary. But what is more beautiful is to witness the craftsmanship of Director and Editor Nicholas Eliopoulos. The art of the edit is where the true craft of filmmaking rests and Mr. Eliopoulos knows what he is doing and how to do it. All around production values are perfect in every respect. I can hardly wait for his next documentary or film. Buy this product, you will be fascinated and dazzled.",1499472000,,501,4.7701149425287355
8521130,5,B007R0PWUO,Great documentary. I did not know much about Ms. Pickford and the history of the film business. She was quite the business powerhouse when most women had no power.,1494028800,,163,4.655172413793103

8521132,5,B007R0PWUO,"A masterpiece of documentary film-making from director Nicholas Eliopoulos, and a true labor of love that was many years in production..
And at last this made it to TV on the Turner Classic Movies channel.  The best inside look at the life of America's Sweetheard who founded United Artists Pictures, with a terrific narration from Michael York and archival appearances by Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,
Lillion Gish, D. W. Griffith, Mack Sennett and of course Mary herself.  We lost a treasured personality of early American cinema history
when Mary Pickford passed away in 1979, but this film keeps her life and legacy alive in a brilliant way.  Highly recommended.",1476662400,,690,5.142857142857143
8521133,5,B007R0PWUO,I love  this fabulous documentary. There's so much information in it regarding Mary Pickford and others and of course a wonderful history on the movie industry.  The footage is wonderful and the quality is excellent. Incredible editing. It's the kind of documentary you could watch again and again.  This is a real treasure.

8521138,5,B007R0PWUO,"Although lengthy, this wonderful biography should appeal to both lovers of silent film and history buffs, too.  In the seeming absence of Pickford's best work from DVD and Blu-ray formats, this is a wonderful telling of a compelling life history.  The first woman to earn $1 million (back in the 1920s!)  Cofounder (with Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and director D. W. Griffith) of United Artists, a vehicle for liberating actors and directors from dictatorial studio owners intent on forcing an industry under their thumbs.  A prodigious amount of work, begun when she was a precocious child who soon became her family's primary breadwinner after her father's death.  Too much to tell here.  If this piques your interest, watch this delightful look at the genesis of motion pictures at the start of America's Century.",1444262400,2,829,5.149253731343284
