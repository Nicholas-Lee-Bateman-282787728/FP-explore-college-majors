6199570,2,B00HR7OOME,"Entertaining yes, but astonishing and insightful, NO.  What they have created is an illusion and led the viewer to believe certain things that just don't add up if you are a painter. There are so many flaws in the presentation.like who did the color mixing as if that is easy in itself? We are led to believe Tim did all the painting, but I do not find that plausible. Plus, we are also led to believe he followed his protocol for applying the paint, when  he did not in recreating the objects sitting on the floor. If one has ever studied painting, painted or taught painting, they would know that it is possible to created magic through paint and patience alone.
I have had beginning painting students recreated Vermeer's paintings that in six weeks, capture the essence of those great works.

6199572,5,B00HR7OOME,"Tim just joined the ranks of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Hockney/dp/0142005126/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Hockney</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philip-Steadman/dp/B0037CDQHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philip Steadman</a>&nbsp;in pi$$ing off the Old Master art snobs, as you might see in other reviews here. Incidentally, he consulted with both of those scholars and, while nothing is absolutely proven, he managed to convince each that his optical gadget is at least as believable as Hockney's camera lucida or Steadman's camera obscura.

It's quite amazing that Tim Jenison had not only the idea about Vermeer's possible optical aids, but the means and the time to create such a convincing demonstration. He started by knocking a wall out of his warehouse workspace, and painstakingly reconstructed the room of ""Music lesson."" Working at various times with live models, this complete tyro to painting created a remarkable replica of that great work, documented in detail in videos that eventually made up this presentation.

It wasn't just the demonstration, plus the demonstration that others could use his method equally well, that supported Tim's ideas. Given the endless time he spent staring at original Vermeers as well as at the scene in his own studio, he noted things like chromatic aberration, a common defect of lenses back then, captured in the original paintings. A true artist (if that phrase actually means much) might have ""fixed"" such things. A purely literal reproduction, like the one Jenison proposed, would simply record it along with everything else. Then, his own experiments with cameras obscura showed that, although they could help in capturing the lines and shapes of an image, they'd be nearly useless for color reproduction as  faithful as Vermeer's. Also, Tim's process help's explain how Vermeer, almost uniquely among the Old Masters, could go directly to color without an underpainting to define the lights and darks. Again, nothing about Vermeer's process is totally proven, but such support makes Tim's remarkable claims even more credible.

Whether or not Vermeer in fact used a gadget like Tim's, this offers a very coherent theory, backed by thorough experimentation. And, for what it's worth, Jenison spent about five years on this project - a period comparable to the time many PhDs need for completing their research. He certainly made a contribution at least the equal of many dissertations.

6199573,5,B00HR7OOME,"I thought it was wonderful - and I thought Tim Jenison was absolutely spot-on regarding Vermeer's techniques.

Once you start watching this delicious documentary - you don't want to miss a single minute of it!",1398643200,10,209,4.9714285714285715
6199574,1,B00HR7OOME,"Hello,
The most accurate and important review of this movie was made by the Academy Award committee who decided it was not worthy of Academy Award , much less even for a final nomination.
Tim did not solve any mysteries regarding how Vermeer painted. It has been known for centuries that Vermeer did use lenses and optics, and it is not cheating to use those tools. Without a doubt, Vermeer did not paint with anything even resembling Tim's gizmo.

VERMEER DID NOT USE TIM' S DEVICE TO PAINT
Here is the proof.
1. On Google ( images) type in ' Monet's Haystack Paintings' .
This series of Monet paintings show how living light changes minute by minute, not to mention hourly and seasonally. Monet changed his canvas every half hour to hour, as the lights, the colors, the values and chroma would change -as the sun rose and set. No one, not even MONET and certainly not TIM with his gizmo, can paint fast enough to record living changing light. If you disagree with this, then you may as well not read the other reasons I will list. I shake my head at even thinking of Tim in the French  countryside, painting the haystacks with his "" mirror on a stick, comparator device"". Those who believe he could do it ... have been fooled.
2. Vermeer did not faithfully copy living changing light. Not in his interior scenes and not in his outdoor scenes. The magic you see in his paintings is a ' creative construct', like all the masterpieces of all the great Masters. Personal choices in colors, values, composition and paint application, carefully, lovingly, thoughtfully decided, painted, then changed, rethought and repainted again and again and again, until it was exactly "" right"" - as his mind wanted it to be.
3. Vermeer  painted exactly as Rembrandt painted, beginning with a brown or muted underpainting color ( called the dead color) to establish the composition. On this structure, he applied glazes for transparency, scumbles for translucent optical grays, and impasto for opacity. Every great Master of his era used this method, based on over 200 years of tradition. This method gives their paintings the magic of color and light we see in their paintings, and respond to aesthetically.
4. X-rays by the National Gallery, of "" The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" prove his use of a flat dark brown under painting. This proves Tim's device was not used.
5. David Hockney, in the year 2000, 13 years before this movie, published his book, Secret knowledge'. It proves without any doubt that many of the a Great Old Masters, 250 years before Vermeer was born, perfected the use of  mirrors and optical lenses to paint photographic looking paintings. Professor Philip Steadman, published his landmark book in 2000, proving without a shadow of a doubt, that Vermeer used the Camara Obscura.
6 Vermeer, used the Camara Obscura like others of his era. With this crude camera, he was able to trace and copy the verisimilitude of nature of an optical projection - exactly like a camera. It would be foolish to outline this verisimilitude, but he could easily paint it with a brown monotone. He painted a monotone because no one can paint accurate colors in the dark. Once his monotone ( dead color) was completed, he then painted with colors in studio lighting.
7. There is no question, Vermeer completed his final coloring from both, direct observation of the model and from copying values and colors from a 2 mirror set up. A mirror flattens the colors and values nature's colors and values.
8. Vermeer had a traditional ' light meter' to gauge variations in values and colors. This dry "" value scale""  of ten to  12 values or more, was used by placing it next to the image reflected in the 2nd mirror.
9. Vermeer had access to a ' wet controlled palette',  a premixed wet color palette in separate value scales of his primary colors as well as black to white. Many artists today, painting in a realism style still use that ancient method.
10. Vermeer and all the Masters applied an ""oil out"" as they painted. This kept the colors saturated so new color values could be accurately judged. It is impossible to gauge color values without an ""oil out"". Some artists call it a ' retouch"". When the Old masters' painting was finished, it was glossy and had lustrous color depth, and no need for varnish. Both Penn and Tim described their finished painting as chalky and matte. To saturate the colors, Tim varnished it. The Old Masters did not varnish their paintings until the paint cured sufficiently, normally 6 to 12 months later, and it was strictly for protection of the paint, not for saturation of color.
11. If I have not yet convinced you, then imagine this. Imagine TIM overlooking the City of Delft, with his gizmo in place. Imagine him trying to copy the living changing lights and colors of the buildings as the North Sea dark clouds overhead steam by. Buildings are cast into deep shadows while those next to them are in brilliant lighting, only to change in a light flash. See the sparkling reflections of the water, reflecting onto the ships, twinkling and flashing changes of sparkling lights. The thought of any mechanical "" color swatch match"" device being able to do this is laughable. BUT , VERMEER did it .... But not with a gizmo comparator device.
CONCLUSION : If I have not fully convinced you, then see a REAL documentary on how Vermeer actually painted, it is the 2009 film, "" Vermeer: Master of Light"" by the National Gallery of Art. ( It is free on YOUTUBE). It is not as "" entertaining"" as Tim's, Teller's and Penn's Hollywood movie, with his daughter in an armature evoking viewer sentimental reaction ( Vermeer used mannequins) . Nor does it have silly comments such as , "" some say he is the greatest artist that ever lived."".
The National Gallery Documentary, is a well made and accurate scholarly research study.

PART TWO. The first part of my review (above) was written after I saw the film at the theater in January. In June, bought the DVD  download version when released . By viewing the movie on an IPAD, one can stop the film to examine it. These are the key points proving Vermeer did not use Tim's gadget to paint with.

1. Tim and Penn state that Vermeer drew no lines and that x-rays prove no lines are under the oil paint. Scientific x-rays confirm this. YET...stopping the film with an IPAD, lets us see the extensive outline drawing on the Masonite wood panel before Tim begins to paint. This very careful outline drawing shows the architecture of the room, the mirror and painting on the back wall, windows and their glass design, the virginal, floor tiles, furniture, rug, plus many other things, ALL IN OUTLINE DETAIL.  Like a paint by number oil painting set for kids.  At no time in the film, is there an explanation WHY the under drawing was put there, nor does the film show HOW the drawing was done. It appears to be a tracing from a color reproduction of a color photograph. We simply do not know! But we do know Vermeer did NOT draw any lines.....SO....why and how ...did Tim?

2.  The Van Eycks were born 200 years before Vermeer, and their paintings are even more photo realistic than those of Vermeer. In 2001, David Hockney's book "" secret knowledge"" eloquently proved they did this by using simple ""projection "" optical lenses and mirrors 200 years before Vermeer was born. . Vermeer did not discover this knowledge..he learned it from the long tradition of their use . It is NOT Cheating to use these projection tools to trace reality and it's verisimilitude. There is NO Vermeer secret, except that he was a genius who expressed his own aesthetic.

3.  Tim and his gadget could never paint a view of Delft with his gadget. But, we know Vermeer did it. Imagine Tim overlooking the city of Delft with his Texas high tech studio in place. His trusty gadget in his hand.  Hockney and Steadman are by his side. Now Tim begins to paint......with his gadget.
  Overhead the North Sea winds blow dark clouds over the city of Delft! The church steeple INSTANTLY turns dark black , covered with shadows..but seconds later it is gleaming, bathed by brilliant light shafts......The people on the shore are walking to and fro, busy with their lives.  Just as we see in Vermeer's masterpiece.!!!
  Suddenly, the ships hoist their anchors, the sails billow out with air, and the ships float away!!!!What will Tim do?  Will he have everything stand still for five  months? His gadget gizmo is a failure because it cannot copy the rapidly changing profound colors and lights and movements of living nature! Mother Nature stands still for no man...and not for Tim's gadget! This is the absolute proof Vermeer did NOT use any mechanical gadget, gizmo, comparator device, to paint with
  In the movie, Tim nailed the coffin on his gizmo when he stood in front of Vermeer's "" View of Delft"" painting in the Mauritshuis museum. Tim said, it looked like a Kodachrome slide. Kodachrome is a 20th century intense color , photographic medium. NOTHING in nature...and certainly not a view of Delft, is ever seen live with Kodachrome colors, appearing like a Kodachrome slide or photograph. This questions Tim's claim...that Vermeer may have used a comparator device to EXACTLY COPY the colors of nature...Kodachrome colors that do not exist in nature!

4. At the beginning of the movie, the video camera zooms in within an inch of Vermeer's original paintings.  We see the great Master's beautiful and sophisticated application of the oil paint. Vermeer's paintings are truly stunning! It leaves us breathless and spellbound! For good reason his paintings are prized and are in the world's great art museums.  At the end of the movie, the film makers DO NOT DARE zoom in closely on the surface of Tim's finished painting. They SHOULD have - and COULD have - placed magnified zoom details of both paintings side by side so we could COMPARE the Vermeer masterpiece with the ""Tim-piece"". For good reasons, the public was never allowed to see it up close to examine it and compare it to the Vermeer.

5. Computer digital Video graphic artists do not use paint colors....they use colored light.  Modern video graphics have an unending number of colors. Tim's ""compare"" device can match colors that DO NOT MOVE, but it cannot match the living, moving profound changes of natures colors and daylight due to daylight changes of the day and season.
Vermeer and the Old Masters had very few colored paints, but by a sophisticated method of applying the paint, they painted highly realistic and photographic-like images. Vermeer ...used an ancient artist's  VALUE FINDER  to "" compare"" the gradations of values and colors. It is simple to make. You draw ten squares in a line. Place pure black paint in one square and at the other end you put pure white paint. Then you carefully mix each square so it shows the subtle gradations of the grays ( values). Every Old Master knew how to use it. It is as effective as a modern light meter.

SUMMARY
Tim did NOT discover Vermeer's secret because there is NO secret on how Vermeer painted his pictures.  Vermeer's  paintings are the result of hard work combined with his genius. OF COURSE Vermeer used optical tools to help him with TRACING space, and perspective and verisimilitude....but he changed the colors and he changed the lights, and restructured the size and shape of objects in the composition. Yes, Vermeer created photographic looking paintings. BUT, Vermeer did not COPY an exact scene of what his optical tools projected.  If it were possible to take a modern photo of Vermeer's subject and then compare it with his final painting, the TWO would NOT  look the same. A photo is a frozen moment of time...Vermeer's paintings are a created construct by an artistic genius.

If you Google ( images) of ""Monet's Haystacks"", series, you will see the profound nuances of nature's living changing colors and light. Beginning at sunrise Monet painted the same haystack throughout one day. Each hour he changed the canvas. Note how the colors, lighting, and the shadows change. Daybreak colors are muted and cool, early morning they become brighter and warm, at noon the colors are stark bright with dark contrasts, early afternoon colors become romantic, late afternoon they become bluish. Mother Nature holds still for no man ....and for no ""comparator"" gadget.

To see how Vermeer really painted , see the Youtube film TITLED: The madness of Vermeer: Secret lives of the artists. This 4 part series on Youtube is a scholarly documentary by the BBC. The information in this documentary PROVES Vermeer did not use a "" comparator mirror"" device to "" color swatch match"" the constantly changing and profound colors and lights of Mother Nature. Tim's movie reinforces that proof.

6199575,4,B00HR7OOME,"""Tim's Vermeer"" (2013 release; 80 min.) brings the story of Tim Jenison, an inventor who has amassed a small fortune over his life time and now has become fascinated (obsessed may be the better word) with the 17th century Dutch master painter Johannes Vermeer. Tim examines in particular Vermeer's painting ""The Music Lesson"", which has an astonishing amount of details in it. Tim eventually comes to the conclusion that Vermeer used a variety of optical devices (mirrors, camera obscura, lenses), and to test his theory, he decides to recreate ""The Music Lesson"" from scratch, even though he is not a skilled painter by any means. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this documentary is made (and narrated) by Penn, he of Penn & Teller. Turns out that Penn and Tim have known each other for many years, and it's easy to see why this particular topic would have peaked Penn's interest enough to make it into a documentary. Second, the feeling of the documentary is pretty much one of a crime caper, in that we get to find out in detail how Tim goes about testing his various theories and his recreation of ""The Music Lesson"". Third, if you don't care for art, in particular painting, save yourself the trouble and catch another movie, as obviously the entire 'raison d'tre' of the documentary is the making of a painting. At some point during his recreation of the painting, Tim gives an exhausted look towards the camera and sighs ""it's like watching paint dry"", much to the delight of the theater's crowd, which exploded in laughter. Last but not least, there is a nice soundtrack to this movie, composed by Conrad Pope and I've made a mental note to myself to check that out as well. (Bob Dylan's ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"" plays over the documentary's closing credits, an obvious but nice choice.)

I saw this documentary recently at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington DC, and the early evening screening I saw this at was absolutely PACKED, which I think is great news. Facts always trump fiction, reason why I love a good documentary more than anything. If you are interested in art and you marvel at how Vermeer might've created some of his best work, you will absolutely love this. ""Tim's Vermeer"" is absolutely worth checking out, be it in the theater or on DVD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394064000,83,2406,4.7398568019093075

6199590,3,B00HR7OOME,"Tim Jenison spent 5 years of his life trying to prove a fascinating theory that Vermeer used an optical device to get the realism and wonderful lighting that have helped make Vermeer's art famous. The film is not objective, every part of it is geared toward proving Vermeer used an optical device, ignoring information to the contrary and distorting much of the information presented. For example, the film makes the argument that the subtle gradations in light on the wall in Vermeer's composition could not be detected by the human eye and this proves an optical device was used. There are a number of problems with that. 1. Any competent artist will use subtle gradations of light in compositions routinely. Nobody needs a device to do it. 2. The shadows on the wall in Vermeer's composition of Music Lesson are not natural. There would have been sharp edges in the shadows cast by the windows if actual sunlight was used. Vermeer's light came from his imagination. Tim Jenison used some kind of constant artificial light provided by lamps to provide the diffused light in his composition, and these lamps were not available to Vermeer. 3. The light on the various objects in the room in Vermeer's composition was unnatural in terms of intensity, for example the vase is brighter than it should be, but part of Vermeer's brilliance lies in his ability to fool us into thinking we are looking at a photograph, despite distortions and unnatural elements he decided to use to improve his composition. Look at the mirror in Vermeer's composition. It is hanging from the wall facing the viewer at about a 5 degree angle. But the reflection of the room in the mirror is at a 45 degree angle. The young lady in the painting is facing straight forward, her back to the viewer. We should see the front of her face in the 45 degree tilted mirror but actually we see her face tilted to the right. You have to look closely at the painting to see these things and you will not hear anyone talking about them in the film since they refute rather than support Jenison's theory. One thing Tim Jenison learned early on in his project was that the camera obscura used as a tool by painters of Vermeer's time cannot be used for painting a replica of a scene. So, Jenison ""invented"" a device that actually worked and that was a kind of reflective telescope. not that you would hear it described as such in the film. Crude reflective telescopes had been invented before Vermeer was born and were used to spot objects such as the rings of Saturn by early astronomers but did the masters such as Vermeer use them to help them paint? An objective view of the pros and cons of Jenison's optical device to assist the artist is provided by a variety of YouTubers who posted videos of them using versions of it to help them paint. A common theme of these videos is that painting using Jenison's device is possible but it is very slow, very boring, very tiring, and produces a paint-by-numbers looking result. Even Jenison in his movie sounded like he was losing his will to live after spending months trying to make his paint-by-numbers version of Vermeer's Music Lesson. The idea that Vermeer ever used any such optical device like Jenison's is ludicrous. Still, Penn and Teller are always entertaining, they made a fun movie, and they will always be my favorite magicians.",1506297600,,3349,4.677966101694915

I am absolutely stunned that Tim accomplished what he did - but - fact is - he is no Vermeer and he even admits it. However, in today's world is a photographer an artist?  Of course.  If Vermeer used a mirror or a camera obscure - he was using technology to enhance his art - as photographers do today.  Rather than see him as cheating, I would see him as advancing the frontiers of painting tremendously, since Tim just proved that he, an unskilled artist, could have painted the Music Lesson.  But could he have imagined it in his mind, the layout, the theme, the colors, the placement and expressions of the characters?  No.  Tim has shown us that technique can be reproduced.

In this amazing journey over a period of five years, Tim Jenison attempts to duplicate a Vermeer painting. It seems impossible at first as he needs to also recreate the entire room in the painting, a duplicate of the original. That in itself takes a lot of talent. But what amazed me was the painting of the rug! Only someone with superhuman patience could duplicate that. And the intricate work of the seahorses was beyond comprehension. For someone who claims not to be an artist, Tim Jenison achieves immense success. You will be completely spellbound by this intricate documentary. So the question is: ""How do you copy one of the greatest artists of all time?"" Apparently you also need to be an inventor. If you are a fan of Vermeer this is a must see! To know how Vermeer created his paintings is very satisfying information.

6199617,5,B00HR7OOME,"Tim Jenison is a brilliant man.  He is an inventor holding many patents and owns a technology company that is quite successful.  Add to this, his fascination with the uniqueness of Vermeer's painting abilities, he was driven to discover what made Vermeer's paintings capture color and more importantly light that other painter's prior to the era were either not able to see or incorporate.  Vermeer did not leave any notes of his work, we have no diary of any sort to refer to.  Did Vermeer have a special gift?  As Jenison contemplates this talent, researches and visits with art experts in the U.S. and Europe there are certain answers that no one seems to be able to provide.  Perhaps, Johannes Vermeer's is best known painting ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"", however he has painted at least 34 paintings, all of which capture light in a very unique manner.  Research shows that unlike many artists past and present, Vermeer did not sketch his scenes before painting them, making his talent and ability seem that much more incredible.

One expert, artist and author, David Hockney has been plagued by questions similar to Jemison.  Hockney published the book, ""Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters"", in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Vel&aacute;zquez) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura, and camera lucida. This became known as the HockneyFalco thesis, named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco, another proponent of the theory.  Jenison meets with Hockney and Falco (which is part of the documentary) to discuss this possibility, which results in a desire in Jemison to recreate the actual painting of The Music Lesson aka A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman (c. 166265) which resides in the Buckingham Palace (and is not available for the public viewing).  However, Jemison is dauntless and actually receives permission to spend one hour with the actual painting with the caveat that he can not film or sketch the painting, he is only allowed to use his eyes to perceive whatever is visible.

Using his personal funds (which have been quite substantial, he finds a vacant warehouse facing North (which is the light he believes is what illuminated the original work) and builds out a recreation of the studio to match Vermeer's (this alone takes months).  Additionally, he recreates the entire scene of the painting itself (more months).  Since some of the furniture and windows are very difficult to find in the resale market, he buys machinery to build the furniture and window fittings in the painting.  He even hand grinds the glass he believes would be true to the time of 1600's!  Likewise, the paint that he uses is only from ingredients of that time and he mixes it himself!  When all is completed he begins the intense effort of painting his own, ""The Music Lesson"".  It takes him months... the painstaking effort is amazing.  Does he do it?  I'm not telling.

This documentary is exceptionally well done.  The background of the paintings of that era is understandable for those unfamiliar with art (age 10 and under), though the logistics may not be of interest to those so young.  Tim Jemison is a fascinating individual in his own right.  His pursuit of knowledge both in time and money is admirable.  Most people would never have invested such energy and the effort to find an answer to 400 year old question.

If you have any interest in art, this is a documentary you must watch.  If you have an artist in your family or circle of friends, this is a great gift (if they don't already have a copy).",1484438400,,3732,4.901273885350318

I went from CT to the Met in 1998 to the Vermeer exhibit. The paintings were so beautiful they seemed to dance with life and to this day this was one of my top five favorite art exhibits.
I learned a bit about lenses from this documentary and the period in which Vermeer painted. It seems plausible he did in fact, paint from a mirrored image. What I loved about this movie was Tim, he designs TV equipment and is brilliant. He's funny, too, dmgood sense of humor and equally bright friends. Favorite scene he recreated Vermeer's room and his daughter posed for him...I won't spoil it...all I can say, great kid, she said nothing... but the scene is hilarious.

6199653,4,B00HR7OOME,"In this documentary, Tim Jenison extends the theory propounded by David Hockney suggesting that classic artists used optical devices as aids to their drawing. In Hockneys book Secret Knowledge, its suggested that various famous artists of the 1500s-1700s and beyond might have used camera obscuras and camera lucidas to at least sketch in their drawings, to get the proper perspective and layout of their work. Tim thinks he found a way to carry those techniques further so that any novice with a paintbrush could achieve, not only outlines and perspective, but could duplicate the subtle shading that masters such as Vermeer achieved in their brilliantly realistic paintings. Tim uses a device he invented consisting of some combination of projected mirror reflections to replicate Vermeers exquisite gradations of shading.

This documentary was produced by the famous team of illusionists Penn and Teller. Some critics of the DVD have suggested that this is perhaps another hoax being perpetrated by the team. I don't think thats true. Nevertheless, instead of illuminating how a painter such as Vermeer could have produced his masterful results  this DVD still leaves me largely in the dark. Here are some of the questions and puzzlements Im left with after watching the documentary and its bonus features.

1) After attentively viewing Tims laborious recreation of a Vermeer classic  I still don't know what he was doing or how he did it! We only get a brief glimpse over his shoulder as he makes a trial run of his technique  as he reproduces with paint an old photograph of his father-in-law. He explains to Penn that he looks at the edge of the image projected in the little mirror thats held at a 45-degree angle over his drawing paper  then he mixes paint right on his paper until it perfectly matches the color at the periphery of the mirror image. He works forward from there, matching colors as he goes. But I don't get it. The mirror isn't projecting any image directly onto his sheet. So how is he positioning his drawing? How is he controlling the contours and juxtapositions of the picture hes replicating? I think the viewer needs much more time peering directly over his shoulder to get any idea of what hes actually doing.

2) Theres something fishy about the beautiful painting of his father-in-law that he produces. We are shown the results half-way through the process. There are thick gobs of paint on his painting, as would be expected if he is mixing-and-matching shadings directly on his work paper (canvas). But then when he shows us the finished product  voila! His father-in-laws painted version is as smooth as the original photograph. There are no signs of paint-layers and build-up; there are no palette-knife thicknesses as there were in the half-finished product. What happened to all that extra paint?

3) Tim doesnt explain how his device is different from the classic camera lucida. In pictures, it looks the same and seems as if it would be performing the same preliminary functions as that small mirror apparatus that you clip onto the edge of your work desk.

4) If Tims method allows any untalented amateur to create a Vermeer-quality painting, why haven't others jumped on his discovery and set to work? Why hasn't his device become widely available in art supply stores?

5) How could Tim have had the skill to master all the trades necessary to recreate so perfectly the room which Vermeer represented in his original painting, and to recreate from scratch all the materials that would have been available to a 17th century artist working in Holland? This insistence on authenticity meant that Tim had to mix his own paints, using only formulae and ingredients used in the 17th century. He ground his own lenses for use in his camera obscura and in his other device. He crafted the furnishings seen in the painting he re-created, including their fine woodworked details. Even though Tim is an inventor, skilled in animation and animatronics  it seems almost superhuman for someone to master all the skills he exhibited in his project of time-travel, fashioning furniture and supplies available over 200 years ago.

6) Why didn't Tim dispense with the camera obscura immediately? After working for quite some time, he realized he didn't need the camera obscura, the image projected through a pin-hole with inserted lens on a wall in a dark room? This would have seemed obvious from the start, if all he was doing was blending paint at the edge of what he saw in a small mirror dangled over his desk?

Well, these and a number of other questions left blank spots in Tims painting for me. However, even if you feel you too might be frustrated by these lacuna left amidst so much laborious detail of demonstration  and even if you're really not that interested in art  I still feel you might find this DVD worthwhile. It has more than a theory of art history to offer. As Teller says in one of the bonus features, this is at heart a film about friendship. It shows Tim and Penn deepening their already long-standing friendship as they work through to bring this project to completion. It is an example of male-bonding over something other than sports or cars or jackass escapades. That, in and of itself, is enough of a rarity to make this film a stand-out.

As to the question this film raises:
If Vermeer and others like him did in fact use optical cheats to create their paintings  does this make them something less than true artists? To provide guidance in answering that question, I suggest Robin Collingwoods book, The Principles of Art.",1474761600,9,5584,4.866174920969441

I loved this movie, but I will say that it made me very anxious towards the end, as Tim's body and mind begin working against him from sheer exhaustion, but such is dedication.

As a member of the working class, this did grate on me. He even went so far as to grind the pigments and make the paint himself??? Unnecessary, he could have bought them and supported the people who taught him how to make the paints.

Also, it's interesting to delve into argument of nascent, intrinsic ability verse exploring available technology. Why is it okay that Picasso can explore the technology of his time but Vermeer cannot? Surely Dutch masters were exploring more that just flowers (not the painting which is th subject of the film). And people forget that part of what made Impressionism possible was the new technology of portable paints. At the end, I find myself marveling that Tim has a Vermeer-quality painting which is not a copy since he used his own rug, etc. I wish I had it.

And now we think we understand that his work ethic was also amazing--I don't think Tim could have produced another painting after watching him produce the one on the film!",1461024000,,445,4.6075949367088604

6199706,5,B00HR7OOME,"Tim Denison is a successful inventor and businessman with eclectic interests. Painting, though, is not one of them. Then his daughter, Lauren, gave him David Hockney's book ""Secret Knowledge"", and he was intrigued. I can't blame him. I have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Knowledge-New-and-Expanded-Edition-Rediscovering-the-Lost-Techniques-of-the-Old-Masters/dp/0142005126/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Knowledge (New and Expanded Edition): Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters</a>&nbsp;and it is fascinating. But Tim, being the curious fellow he is, took his fascination one very big step further. He decided to see if he could paint a Vermeer using a camera obscura and mirrors.

Tim was thinking of a youtube video showing the results of his efforts. Fortunately for us, he told his friend, Penn Jillette, of Penn & Teller fame, about his project and suddenly it bloomed into a full-blown movie project, fully documented as an experiment which could stand the test of nay-saying scrutiny. It started with months of re-creating the room in Vermeer's ""The Music Lesson"", grinding his own paint pigments and even grinding the mirrors and lenses he'd use  now that was a stultifying job.

Along the way, they showed David Hockney what they were up to, as well as Philip Steadman, whose later book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vermeer-s-Camera-Uncovering-the-Truth-behind-the-Masterpieces/dp/0192803026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces</a>, received as much disdain as was showered on Hockney. Other participants include Martin Mull (painter and entertainer) and Colin Blakemore (Oxford Professor specializing in vision & the brain).

Wait 'til you see the part about ""the seahorse smile"". Tim's understated joy as he holds a print of ""The Music Lesson"" up to his eye lengthways and sees the exact optical distortion that he sees in his own mirrors. It's a beautiful moment.

I really really enjoyed this show. They had me right from the beginning, when Jillette explains: ""When you x-ray these intricate images [Vermeer's paintings] you don't find the usual artists' sketches underneath. It's as if Vermeer was some unfathomable genius who could just walk up to a canvas and magically paint with light.""

As Tim says in Bonus Feature #2, ""I got a real sense, I think, of what Vermeer must have gone through, if I'm right about this. It's really really hard. It does not make it easy to paint. It's not a short cut. It's not cheating. It's just a way to get towards perfection.""

""Tim's Vermeer"" originally aired in 2013. The show itself is 80 minutes. The Blu-Ray and DVD present the show in 1.78:1 aspect ratio and 5.1 Dolby Digital. The BluRay is 1080p High Definition. You can listen to it in English with  Audio Descriptive Service. Also, subtitles are available in English, English SDH, Spanish, French, Korean, Thai, Chinese Traditional and Portuguese.

Subtitles are not available on the Special Features, but I hope that doesn't mean you miss these bonuses, because they added to my enjoyment:
....1.  Commentary Track. Re-watch the show with commentary by Teller (director), Tim Jenison (the titular Tim), Penn Jillette (producer and narrator)and Farley Ziegler (producer). In the interest of making the show NOT ""like watching paint dry"", it was pared down from 2400 hours of film footage.
During the sequence where Philip Steadman visits Tim's San Antonio warehouse, Teller (he talks!) mentions: ""[Steadman] and his wife told us stories about how brutal some of the people in the art community can be on this particular topic. They have a kind of religious fervor about Vermeer.""
....2.  ""Toronto International Film Festival Q&A"" (21 minutes) Moderated by Thom Powers, commentators on stage are Penn Jillette, Teller, Tim Jenison and Farley Ziegler. As Teller says, ""This is a detective story. It's a 350 year-old detective story.""
Teller got involved in the project because ""This is a real event that may really affect art history. You don't often actually have the documentary cameras in there during one of these personal amazing discoveries, that has repercussions down the line.""
....3.  Deleted Scenes (16 minutes) These four scenes include an unused introduction starting with Jack the Ripper.
....4.  Extended & Alternate Sequences (76 minutes) Two scenes in their original expanded form. One includes the sequence (left in the film) where Tim has just finished the very difficult virginal, and says, ""I think the rug is going to be a piece of cake compared to the virginal.""  Boy, did that turn out to be a wrong!
....5.  Theatrical Trailer. Tim says of Vermeer: ""It's possible that he was more of a tinkerer, more of a geek. And in that way, I feel a kinship with him.""
....6.  Previews. These are commercial trailers for five other movies.

A very enjoyable show. Persistence and a Need to Know personified.

The telling of this story by both Penn Jellite and Teller gave the book a build up that the movie doesn't live up to comments made by both
Penn and Teller. I am suppose to be descriping the actual movie. But the reason I paid to watch this movie was comments by Penn and Teller.

6199717,1,B00HR7OOME,"Tim, a poor little rich boy who made his billions with hotshot computer graphics and animation, simply hates the idea that Vermeer, who lacked the kind of sophisticated hardware and software that Tim has available, was able to pull off those masterpieces beloved by the world.  So Tim, rich and clever Tim, decides that this week, rather than building yet another amazing invention, will instead prove - unreservedly - that Vermeer was a con artist who relied on smoke and mirrors - not talent, not genius - to create his masterpieces.  And then make a movie about it.  And guess what?  Tim was right!  And all of us, all over the world and down through the centuries, were wrong!  Vermeer WAS a fraud!  Well how 'bout that! Thanks Tim!

Tim's next lesson for humanity: Proving that the pyramids were created by visiting aliens, since, obviously, the technology needed was far beyond the grasp of mere humans. Or perhaps the proof that Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling was simply a paint-by-numbers project.

I have studied the lives and art of the great masters my whole life. The unmitigated gall of this nitwit adolescent pretender to spout to the world that Vermeer was a fraud was sickening to watch, and could only have been put on screen by a sad, jealous, rich little dilettante who surely must have been mistreated and belittled as a boy.",1457913600,3,1352,4.793103448275862

I have never given much thought to Vermeer, and indeed was ignorant about the mystery surrounding his technique of ""painting with light."" But I believe Tim has cracked that mystery. A video engineer by trade, and pretty much all-around inventor, Tim has revealed how technology and art can literally go hand-in-hand. Having never painted artistically before, Tim Jenison sets out in this documentary to complete a Vermeer painting himself, using a method he believes Vermeer might have used to paint his remarkable paintings.

I know Tim didn't create a perfect copy, but that wasn't his goal, and he did create his own amazing artwork.

I am not a purist by any stretch of the imagination and this film only reinforced my feeling that in the end its the finished product that is the most important regardless of the path taken to achieve any concept. What is true creative art, is the question I am left with. And dose it really matter how the final result is achieved regardless of the choices made that are compromised or not, to reach the desired cohesive finished product.

In the end I am only left with endless questions regarding thousands of priceless art that line museum walls that are admired and cherished for centuries. While honoring the incredible capabilities of the great masters and their ability to capture the impossible on canvas elevating them to an untouchable genius category.

6199764,5,B00HR7OOME,"Outstanding journey of intellectual discovery. This film operates on many levels: on the highest level, it has nothing to do with Vermeer or even painting, rather it is an exquisite, abstract riff on the human spirit, thought and discovery. Zooming in, past that level, you get to the passionate amateur, amateur from the Latin amare, to love; you see the passion of the curious and unfettered mind, you see what humans can do with little or no hope of recompense, just for the love of the thing. A paean to passion, as it were--a beautiful thing.

Next, you have a film that illuminates the creative process itself, the way a relentless and honest questioner can summon insights to break through the stoutest of barriers in the way of getting to his goal.

Then you have the consideration of the painting and the technique itself, which is simply fascinating. If you worry about whether it proves anything in particular, or debases art to a craft, well, you are wallowing in jejune emotionalism and callow intellectualism and should return to this film once you've begun to grow up and get serious.",1448150400,,1099,4.809523809523809
6199765,5,B00HR7OOME,Loved this fascinating documentary. I cannot believe the patience and tenacity has while pursuing his love of Vermeer.,1448064000,,118,5.611111111111111

6199767,5,B00HR7OOME,"Every art student should see this, because it distinguishes the true craft of the painter from the oppressive highfalutin prose of the art historian, and it shows how Tim Jenison, as an art student, goes well above and beyond the ordinary to do what's called a ""master copy painting in a traditional art academy. It also shows how even with the aid of technology a painter still has to be pretty good with the materials and tools, and how an artist has to have something to say in their work that's worth the investment, and offers a worthwhile experience, to the viewer. Copying a painting is an adventure; being an artist is a journey. Thank you Penn and Teller, for choosing to make this documentary about how, in all likelihood, Vermeer conjured his paintings. This is truly your magnum opus.",1447372800,,796,4.692857142857143
6199768,5,B00HR7OOME,"This is one of those stories that so captivates you while you're experiencing it that you're regretting  the end long before its over.

The flawless editing is done in a minimalist, ""less is more"" style without a single instance of unnecessary camera or processing work.  This approach lends so much more power and ""volume"" to the story, the action and Penn's narration.  Oscar nomination for the editor?

Tim's Vermeer is a commentary on blending art & technology, the value of discovery for discovery's sake and the ever astonishing cleverness of our imperfect human brain.

In ""Tim's Vermeer"" we're also witnessing a case study on harnessing the brain's power to leverage feedback loops for performance enhancement..a tool that needs more study and implementation in our 21st century world of unlimited information and speed.

6199772,5,B00HR7OOME,"I had seen the name and somewhat nondescript packaging and it just never really grabbed my attention. I quite literally clicked on it by accident when looking for something new to watch and noticed in the description that Penn and Teller were producer and director for it.

The basic mystery concerns how painters went from slightly better than cavemen scrawling cartoony 2D doodles to near photorealistic level in a single generation. The film's protagonist decided that if he discovered the secret, even he (a decidedly non-skilled painter) could produce a similar quality painting.

It isn't spoiling too much to say he might be on to something, otherwise they wouldn't have made a feature film about it... Nonetheless it is well worth watching to see the process of discovery and his amazing efforts at recreating it. I highly recommend it for a fascinating journey.",1445644800,4,870,5.076923076923077

He's been fascinated by the idea that Vermeer may have used a technique called Camera Obscura to create is works.  Vermeer has an uncanny ability to ""Paint with Light,"" in his works.  Compared to works of the same period, Vermeer's come alive, more like a photograph than  a painting.
With several false starts, Jensen tries to re-create the techniques that he believes Vermeer uses.

I'm not a big fan of the jump cuts they used in the editing of the interview material, but that's a personal preference. To me, it's sloppy and doesn't show a lot of effort in the edit, but some people like jump cuts so it shows journalistically that there was an edit at that point instead of trying to hide it.

I don't have a strong interest in art, but anyone who is interested in classic art or who has an engineering mindset will likely enjoy this film. The process by which Tim goes about creating the process to replicate the painting is very interesting, and he makes a good argument for the idea that classic Vemeer paintings were created using technology more than artistry.",1424736000,,482,5.0375

6199866,2,B00HR7OOME,"What if there were a theory that Vladimir Horowitz pretended to play a mechanical piano that actually played the notes for him...and someone decided to prove it by building a mechanical piano that sounded kinda a little like Horowitz? Or what if someone took the notion that Michael Jordan had special jets in his shoes that allowed him to jump...and proved it by building jet shoes that allowed him to jump about half as well as Michael Jordan? I'm not a logician but those absurd examples seem roughly comparable to this exercise. Jenison does indeed come up with an ingenious device that helps him copy Vermeer, but does he prove that Vermeer used the same method?

There are some serious historical fallacies in the documentary, which is odd considering how much research Jenison put into this. Vermeer was not, contrary to legend, an unknown artist during his lifetime. He was elected head of his local guild numerous times. His output was small, but his work was appreciated. We don't have a lot of information about his early life or training, but it would be extremely difficult to join a 17th century guild without going through the usual apprenticeship in an established artist's workshop.

After all the trouble Jenison goes through to recreate Vermeer's materials and methods, his technique is completely off. Vermeer painted in layers, not directly. He used a lot of ultramarine in his underpaintings, which was applied in tempera to preserve the color. This is visible from some of the inept restoration and cleaning that have exposed the blue. That makes it unlikely that Vermeer would have worked with such a piecemeal approach, painting little spots at a time the way Jenison does; he would have developed the entire painting in stages. It's very possible that Vermeer used some kind of optical device, but he would probably have employed it much more freely than how Jenison suggests. Perhaps he set his easel up next to the image and used it as reference, the way some contemporary artists and illustrators use photographs. Frankly, I still don't completely understand how Jenison used his device, although they attempted to demonstrate it numerous times. It seems as though you are not able to see the part you are painting and the projected image at the same time; you paint up to the edge of the image and try to match what is there...seems kind of cumbersome in theory, although I would like to try it.

There is one particularly ridiculous and baffling section that discusses the impossibility of being able to paint the changes in light on a wall without using a device. Vermeer's walls are, admittedly, particularly beautiful--largely because of the way he composed negative space--but competently painting light on a wall is not THAT difficult. Jenison's argument (if I understand it--to be honest, I was scratching my head) assumes that artists look at one little part at a time, comparing tiny areas of value against each other. In reality, an artist looks at the whole wall at once and is able to see the large changes in value and color.

Finally, I am extremely skeptical about Jenison's lack of  prior experience with painting. He just seems too comfortable mixing colors--that's not something people can figure out on the spot. He knows how to effectively create different values (although his skin tones are weak); most novices would just add black and white and get chalky results. Although there are problems in his painting, particularly the hard edges, his end result is actually pretty good--too good for a beginner, tracing or not. Many times in the video people people repeat ""he is not a PAINTER""--but what exactly is his experience? Tim Jenison is one of the founders of Newtek, which produces extremely sophisticated imaging and animation software. It seems doubtful that he had no prior art training to learn about light and shadow, color, form and perspective, since that's what his products excel at digitally reproducing.  Considering Penn Jillette's participation, I'm almost inclined to think this documentary might be some kind of elaborate prank to ridicule art historians.",1424304000,3,4126,5.00728862973761
6199867,5,B00HR7OOME,"Unbelievable!  If you love the works by Vermeer, this documentary will astound you.  Tim Jenison, an inventor from San Antonio, worked for four years to produce ""The Music Lesson"" using the same optical technology, camera obscura, as he believes Vermeer used. Tim had no previous art lessons and painted solely using tools and materials he created by researching the artist Vermeer.

The amazing thing about watching this is that I just kept thinking something was going to happen that would make it worth my $12.98, so I watched to the end.  What an embarrassment.  Works of art are not made this way.  Its like he tried to scheme up the longest, most expensive, most difficult, most unbelievable way he could to produce a bad imitation of a great painting, and then suggest the artist did it the same way.  If he wanted to prove something, he should have produced a great work of art himself.

I could never get the painting out of my mind and always wanted to see more of Vermeer's work.  This documentary of Tim Jenison's quest was a fun ride.  I was ready to recommend it to high school students (public, private, parochial, homeschooled) until Tim used the f-word in one scene.  How disappointing that he didn't consider the potential for showing his documentary to young adults because he could have done a voice-over at that particular moment.  Nothing of his work would have been compromised by omitting a gutter term.",1422835200,,638,4.711711711711712
6199871,5,B00HR7OOME,"Do you love Vermeer enough to start a long journey? A journey to spend 5 years or 1825 days to: think, imagine, travel, meet experts, experiment with forgotten and secret technology, re-invent, build a studio set with handmade furniture, paint, paint, paint and then completely succeed to hang a perfect oil painting on the wall of your bedroom. (You never had a training, you are not a painter, you just simply fascinated with the perfection and photo-like quality of Vermeer's paintings.) Tim Jenison did just that. In the process he discovered the most likely method that Vermeer used, but was unknown/forgotten for centuries. (We also find out that Vermeer's ""The Art of Painting"" is a definitely misleading representation of his own technique.)

Tim was almost obsessive, he strictly observed the 17th century Dutch technology, all tools, paints, lenses were created without the use of modern methods. There was no artificial lighting, everything to the minutest detail was recreated to match the arrangement of ""The Music Lesson"".  This documentary is an entertaining travel through time as we follow Tim's progress and by the end he makes us eager students of this style of painting. I think Tim is clearly a genius on his own right, due to his creativity, dexterity and his commitment. I hope he will want to have a Caravaggio on his bedroom wall next, because the light effects of this Italian master's more dynamic paintings (and candle lights) are bordering a miracle.",1422748800,,1479,5.057377049180328

Viewers visit Delft, parts of England and Tim Jenisons fascinating studio in San Antonio, Texas, and get to spend time with David Hockney, Philip Steadman and Martin Mullall famous artists who contribute a lot to the story.

Tims dedication, patience and perseverance are remarkable, making the story very human. I have watched the movie more than 10 times and each time I learn more. Its that kind of film. And if you are a fan of this movie, be sure to watch the extras for a lot more insight.

The editor Patrick Sheffield deserves major kudos for the way he put the movie together. You realize this all the more after watching the extras on the Blu-Ray version and learning about the thousands of hours of footage that had to be edited down and stitched together. The final product flows naturally and keeps your interest throughout.

Conrad Pope (music) also deserves a lot of credit and thanks for the success of the movie, as the beautiful music ties things together, keeps the pace and accentuates the mood and message from start to finish.

I studied this in art school back in the 70s and the question has always remained on my mind.  This fellow has taken the questions a step further by duplicating the sets and steps that Vermeer might have used and painted a beautiful painting in the style of the great artist.  It is spellbinding, astounding, curious, perplexing and above all entertaining to the extreme.

6199939,5,B00HR7OOME,"This is a very fun ride into the crazy side where art and technology mesh. While completing my BFA in Drawing and Painting in the 70's, it was already thought that Vermeer MAY HAVE used the camera obscura to create his landmark paintings.

This is painting during that time after glass lenses were ground and polished but before the time of photography, when lenses could replicate the the light of an image on a screen or a wall (what we now call the 'plate').

Could an artist use lenses to ""copy"" a scene? You bet! Today, we call the technology an ""opaque projector"". Did Vermeer? We'll probably never know.

The thing I like most about Tim's Vermeer is, IF he used lenses to create his art, did it require as much tenacity and skill as a ""regular artist"" who avoided that 'new' technology? And if not, what does this say about Walter Disney, web animators and all the rest who came after?

For artists, this documentary is both enlightening and fun.",1412985600,,953,4.555555555555555

To test this, Jenison recreates the conditions of  Vermeer's studio and the optics to paint his own oil copy of Vermeer's ""The Music Lesson,"" and prove his theory.  Jenison is completely hands on like one might imagine Vermeer, attempting perfect condtions for the room whereby to utilize natural lighting.  Though exhausted and overwhelmed from this grueling effort, he does finally produce the finished reproduction using  optics and the result is compelling.  If Vermeer did use this technique, it reveals a painting skill available to anyone yet doesn't diminish his artistic genius.

6199960,3,B00HR7OOME,"TIM'S VERMEER is an exceptionally strange documentary.  Inventor Tim Jenison, with a proven track record of scientific and other discoveries, sets himself the task of recreating Vermeer's ""The Music Lesson"" using optical techniques with mirrors.  The task is long and laborious - from inception to conception takes five years - but in the end Jenison manages to produce a copy of the Vermeer work that is thoroughly creditable.  Teller's film includes several clich&eacute;s of the tele-documentary genre; the highs and the lows, the periods of difficulty when Jenison wonders whether his task has any real values; the intense emotion when he finishes; and the triumphant vindication of his thesis that painters were often more scientific than was first assumed.

To prove his point, Jenison enlists the help of a long list of experts, led by David Hockney and including Martin Mull, and Professors Philip Steadman and Colin Blakemore.  All of them support his theory that the division between 'art' and 'science' is not quite as great as art critics might have first assumed; like Jenison himself, Vermeer probably made use of scientific or optical techniques while creating his work.

This point is good as far as it goes, but it leaves the viewer confused.  If, as Jenison proves, a painter uses optical techniques, and a self-confessed non-painter such as Jenison can successfully reproduce the painting, then it follows that the artist is not quite the genius that critics might have first assumed.  As Andy Warhol proved nearly fifty years ago, art is infinitely reproducible, which therefore confounds the Romantic veneration of the author/ artist as genius.  On the other hand, Teller's documentary celebrates Jenison, not necessarily as a painter, but as a successful inventor with a unique capacity for computer recreation.  In his way he is just as skillful as Vermeer was nearly four centuries ago.  TIM'S VERMEER actually ends up by celebrating the genius of the individual, even while trying to show that their works can be reproduced by self-confessed amateurs in the painting arts.

Jenison is an engaging presence onscreen, but we do wish that the documentary had been a little bit better thought out.",1411257600,2,2218,5.182072829131653

OK after further checking, Amazon will not let anyone stream a movie if the monitor is connected by anything except a HDMI cable.

I had heard that Vermeer knew a really advanced lens crafter in Holland in a book by Bill Bryson (A Short History of Nearly Everything) which could have explained Vermeer's rise from obscure painter to the top of the art world, so this caught my eye.  Tim is a very cool and successful guy, and Penn is an old friend, and they made this film in a sort of haphazard way, so the editing is a bit funky, but that is part of the charm.  Tim's three daughters get involved.  The only thing lacking was a better exposition of the science involved.  Also, I thought the interviews with the Brits were a waste of time and added nothing to the exposition.  Otherwise, great art history!  Makes you redefine the notion of artistic talent!

Created by Penn and Teller, one expects a snarky take on the subject. Fortunately, this is not the case and the material is presented with respect and some mild humor. Also, Teller directs with a light hand (no showy tricks involved) and I must say his choice of music works beautifully.
I'm no art historian and don't have a vested interest in whether his paintings were freehand or created with technological aids, yet I found the subject fascinating, and the whole project very cool.
I could go on (this movie gives the viewer a lot to chew on, is the final product art? For example) but I'll just end by saying that it's an interesting film and one that is fun to discuss with friends afterward.

Tim takes 350 year old technology and attempts to create his own Vermeer and the result will make you think three times about all the ""proof"" you've heard about that ""proves"" how Vermeer created his One-Of-A-Kind pieces.

This movie literally touched me (for my own personal reasons) and it made me cry when it reached a certain point. I've not cried about a movie in awhile. I've cried in front of many people: mommy, friends, other family, co-workers, women, guys who I don't know, all kinds of Military personnel including a couple of Generals, my doggies, my Basic Drill Sergent, the dancing purple penguin, unicorns, a guy actually named ""Jesus"", Iraqi magicians, people from India, my pet scorpion, a blade of grass and my can of Coke-Cola (all rights reserved).

On a serious note, if you love art, I mean you truly love art to the point it makes you think of certain things in life that are deeply personal to you, makes you have butterflies when you see something way more better/perfect than ""mind blowing""...this is a movie for you. If you LOVE to see stories about people whom have a ""light-bulb"" click on, follow the breadcrumbs, and try to make it work for themselves...this is a movie FOR you.

I'm not saying you'll end up emotional as I did however, you'll be touched and it WILL open and broaden your mind on all things in the world including if we should take things all the way to such technical bounds in order to explain how they're done.

6200000,3,B00HR7OOME,"Reading the comments on this show is amazing, especially some of those that like it.  It is clear that deep emotions are involved.

It is not surprising that Vermeer used whatever tools were available to help him paint.  How much he used optical devices to help him will always be open to question, but the argument that a non-painter can paint a painting as great as Vermeer's using an optical device seems very far fetched to me.  Light changes.  Things move.  Paint is different from LEDs and cameras.  Inspiration and skill in composition are as important as technical skill.

On the other hand. I do not believe that Tim was making the claim that he had painted a painting as great as Vermeer's despite all the silliness that the script writers put in to make the show more dramatic and interesting.  To me, he was making the more modest claim that artistic genius is understandable.  The people who do it are human beings just like us, and he was raising the interesting question of what is the use and meaning of art when machines can ""do it better?""

My complaint about the show is that it was 30 minutes too long, and that it became a show about Tim, who I am sure is a very nice and very accomplished person, instead of Vermeer.  If I could fly around the world on my own jet, I would find something better to do than to copy someone else's work I hope.",1410134400,3,1363,4.408

6200002,2,B00HR7OOME,"Tim is a ""master"" Tim, but nothing remotely akin to Jan Vermeer. As much as he may be correct about Vermeer's use of optics (and much has been written about this already), Vermeer simply did not paint like this. He used many glazes from thin to thick, to thin, adding highlights along the way to create his moving and meditative visual masterpieces. Tim's technique is a sophisticated ""paint by (incalculable) numbers."" If you put his mentally computer-generated brushstrokes he calls a painting next to that of one of the most blatant forgeries by Han van Meegeren, Tim's would come up rather low on the level of a painter's skill and art. Not having seen Tim's picture, but having seen almost all of the few paintings left by Vermeer, I cannot imagine that Tim's obsessive cerebral reproduction is anything but a lifeless and soulless scrawl next to Vermeer's untimely, passionate, inspired vision. Again, while admire Tim's interest in the optical process, as an artist who has created a ""masterpiece,"" albeit simulated, he is but a tinkerer, and his result is a long involved, artistically void parlor. And if he believes he can create a Vermeer, he needs to look up the word ""hubris."" If he anyone imagines that his invention simulates true art, they have instead degraded art.

Rather than just speculate, Tim set out to duplicate the painting, ""The Music Lesson"" to a degree of detail you have to see to believe.  The story is a Sherlock Holmes mystery that unravels nicely and definitively by the end.  Easy to watch and understand by any layman.

It never ceases to amaze me the lengths that people will go, and what the are devoted to.

This guy dedicates years of his life, trying to prove how Vermeer painted, did he ""cheat"", is it ""cheating""  you will have to decide that for yourself

6200036,4,B00HR7OOME,"San Antonio's Tim Jenson made a tidy sum helping movie studios with various technology schemes and classifies himself as an inventor.  Using a book, given to him by his daughter called ""Secret Knowledge"" by England's David Hockney as a starting point, Jenson sets out to prove Hockney's hypothesis regarding the great Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer.  Vermeer's paintings were so unlike others from the era (1660's) in that they were much brighter, clearer and had an almost photographic element to them.  Hockney's theses was that Vermeer might have used technology of the day, specifically a Camera Obscura, to create his art. Jensen, evidently with an abundance of time and money at his disposal, sets out to prove it.

Essentially the belief was that using the device or something like it allows more natural light to be projected onto a wall via mirror-like lenses, much as a camera works.  This all sounds pretty mundane I know, but the film moves along quickly with narrative gaps filled in by Jensen's friend Penn Jillette.  Jillette's comedic/magician partner, Teller directs the documentary.  Jensen's painstaking journey requires that he recreate the setting for one of Vermeer's best known works called ""The Music Lesson"" which he does in a warehouse in Texas.

He also uses only materials that were available at the time to create the paint and lenses.  He builds all the furniture, fabricates flooring, rugs and other accessories from scratch.  The achievement is remarkable.  Jenson, obviously patient and determined, almost loses it over dabbing a series of dots on a canvas painted carpet.  The documentary shows Jensen's determination and would seem to close the gap between a scientist and an artist.  I found it very interesting.

The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The film is shot using digital cameras for the most part but there is a lot of archival footage provide mostly from Jensen home movies and other sources.  As you might expect the quality is inconsistent for that reason alone.  There is nothing objectionable to the look overall but it's nothing special either.  Essentially what should be expected.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is workmanlike.  The film features interviews, and Tim's work for the most part, so it is heavily dialog driven.  It is properly centered and very clear.  The surrounds only really get any action when the music plays.  No complaints.  Here are the extras:

There was something that bothered me about it though and I still don't know exactly what.  I know artists used the tools of lenses etc... but this guy seemed to have so much attention on it that he boiled these amazing masterpieces down into something anyone could do.  I doubt it.  And I noticed that the two or three 'experts' he had there thought he did a good job... but were unimpressed with any artistry.  But that's just my take on it.

6200053,4,B00HR7OOME,"I am admittedly a novice in the history of artwork paintings. This movie brought me a wealth of knowledge during the period of Vermeer, and his fellow artists. While I was aware of ""pre-drawing"" by many painters, I was not aware of the use optics and the inverted images. The theory of how Vermeer achieved his paintings required research of that period, and what was available to reach the quality of his paintings, compared to others during that time. Eureka! I appreciated the lengths that were gone to, in order to precisely replicate the environment of Vermeer's time. Quite phenomenal. I also believe that Tim came to have more respect for Vermeer, as he attempted to replicate his artwork. I've not given any details of the movie away, so consider it very worthwhile if you are intrigued not only by art, but introspective of how it possibly came about.",1408233600,,860,4.778523489932886

Tim's Vermeer presents a view into this masters work that is thought provoking, insightful, and, to say the least, very interesting. This theory of how Vermeer created his masterworks had my interest from beginning to end. Inventor Tim Jenison actually recreates Vermeer's studio, then constructs the optical devices that he surmises Vermeer used. Then, to prove his theory, he recreates one of Vermeer's paintings. This in and of itself is amazing, as Jenison has no background or training as a painter. The result of his efforts is astounding. I highly recommend this DVD.",1408233600,,683,5.218181818181818

I'm a ""bad"" artist, who loves to paint scenery from a photograph in front of me so the subject's already in 2D. So I loved watching Tim work from the lenses & mirrors, and was so impressed by all the thought and work he put into re-creating the physical room scene of the Vermeer painting (was all of that hand work so necessary???). Why should the modern world be so shocked that some of the old masters probably used technical tricks to help them achieve a better result?

The point of the documentary, it seems to me, is ""What is Artistry?'""  To discuss the technique used to create a great work of does not imply a contempt for the work.  If this were the case there could be no serious discussion of any work of art. Vermeer's work is treated with reverence by Mr Jenison. Anyone who has stood in front of a Vermeer knows all to well that the work before him is exceptional for even the greatest of the masters.  The first question on my s lips was, ""How did he do that?""  I suspect my response is shared by more than me and Tim Jenison.  The documentary does not reduce Vermeer's work in the slightest.  We'll never know exactly how Vermeer created his amazingly beautiful works of art, but Mr Jenison and Penn and Teller give us much to think about.",1407974400,,1019,4.475675675675675
6200064,1,B00HR7OOME,The movie is smug aand self-satisfied but it's not very good. They miss a big opportunity to unpack what makes paintings powerful and timeless--surely it is not just a sense if realism as they imply. Also why no engagement with actual skeptics of the theory? Of course two scholars who wrote books about this idea are going to be supportive of the endeavor. I would skip this movie.,1407974400,6,382,4.632352941176471

Tim is not a painter, but his finished painting is remarkable. This film is a perfect example of the ""scientific method"". He proposed a theory, then designed a experiment to prove or disprove it.

6200076,4,B00HR7OOME,"What exactly is the relationship between science and art? Are they entirely separate domains or is there, Venn-diagram-like, some overlap between them?

The 17th Century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer has long been considered the worlds master of the photographic painting.  So lifelike, in fact, are Vermeers works that it has long been speculated that he may have used some kind of scientific device available at the time to help him achieve the effect. Well, filmmaker Penn Jillette, with the help of Tim Jenson - an inventor, NOT a painter - has decided to get to the bottom of the controversy. The result is Tims Vermeer, a brief (76 minutes), fast-paced and utterly absorbing documentary that provides an aesthetic and intellectual feast for art lovers and quite a feast for lovers of science as well.

Since this IS Penn Jillette were talking about here - an illusionist who is also a tireless advocate for rationalism and empiricism - its fitting that the movie would apply scientific precepts to its analysis of art. Tim hypothesizes that Vermeer may have used a device called a camera obscura combined with a small portable mirror to achieve an unprecedented verisimilitude in his paintings. Its pure speculation, since Vermeer left no notes behind documenting his creative and technical process. So Tim has decided to paint his own Vermeer using the technique he postulates the artist himself used, and to document that process on film.

To that end, Tim has chosen Vermeers The Music Lesson as his subject to copy, going so far as to recreate the room, along with the people and objects contained therein, of the original painting down to the smallest detail, only utilizing (and even crafting, if necessary) lenses, mirrors, lighting and paints that were in existence in the 1600s. It is a project that would take five full years to complete.

If Vermeer did indeed use these optic tricks to achieve his effect, does that somehow diminish him as an artist? Does it make his skill as a painter less astonishing, even if it heightens his ingenuity as an inventor and problem-solver? Probably no more so than a second-rate painter being able to replicate (i.e., forge) any art masterpiece diminishes the talent of the original artist. And why would it be considered cheating for an artist to incorporate all the technological devices available to him at the time to help him in his painting? Why must there exist an arbitrary and artificial dividing line between science and art? These are the questions that Tellers fascinating little movie brings to the fore.

But isn't it better just to keep it all as a mystery, to declare Vermeer an artistic genius of the first rank and leave it at that? Perhaps, but then we wouldnt have Tims Vermeer to inspire and engage us.",1407628800,,2777,4.91044776119403

That was my dire situation when I stumbled upon Tim's Vermeer.

This lighthearted, fascinating documentary about one man's passionate quest to copy a painting by Vermeer was thoroughly engaging.  Just what the doctor ordered for a summer cold (well, that and a dose of Vitamin C and chicken noodle soup).

This film could have been quite fascinating if it had woven in more background about Vermeer and other artists of that era. Instead, it  focused on the technical aspects of how Vermeer paintings might have been created. That artists of that age used the camera obscura and other such tools is something I learned in Art History 101 back in the 1970s. They had their tools, we have ours; big deal.

Instead, most of the last part of this short film was dedicated to watching Tim apply tiny brushstrokes to his canvas and blather on about how bored he was with the process. Really? No one forced him to do this experiment; it was his own idea. I fought the urge to take a nap.

I really don't get the hype and high praise. This is not a well done documentary. Also, Penn and Teller, who are involved with this film, aren't the most credible guys on earth.",1406332800,,919,4.491017964071856

6200154,5,B00HR7OOME,"I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this movie. It held me in its grip from start to finish, made me wonder just how someone could be so possessed to do what Tim Jenison did and then made me notice that I had just spent 80 minutes never looking at the clock to find out when the movie would end. I just enjoyed it from start to finish.

Narrated by Penn Jillette and directed by Teller (of Penn & Teller fame), the movie tells the story of Penn's friend Tim Jenison, an inventor and electronics whiz who loved the paintings of 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. What intrigued him the most was the fact that Vermeer's paintings had an almost photographic appearance to them, something impossible to be done at that time since photography was years away from being developed. How had Vermeer accomplished this? Jenison set out to discover how.

Using the knowledge that was at hand at the time, Jenison decides that Vermeer must have used a series of mirrors and lenses to discover a way to paint as he did. Jenison constructs a small version of what he envisions Vermeer did and then paints a picture of his father in law from a photograph, even though he'd never painted anything at all in his life. The effect and painting that result is amazing. But that's on a smaller plain here, not near the size of the actual paintings that Vermeer did. So how did he do it?

This becomes the quest that Jenison then begins, a quest that takes him well over a year to finish and be filmed. When attempting to recreate Vermeer's painting ""The Music Lesson"", he begins by building the entire scene real size from scratch, using as many methods of recreating the actual items as possible. He goes so far as to research the way Vermeer would have made the paint that he used to create this work and follows those same sets of instructions to make his own paints. All of this works toward the single goal of trying to paint his own rendition of Vermeer's work or this time around, Tim's Vermeer.

This is perhaps one of the best made documentaries I've ever seen. It never gets dull, never gets boring no matter if at times you are simply watching someone paint. The entire process that Jenison goes through as he tries to figure out just how it was done and then the patience he uses to accomplish the same thing is mind boggling. While you enjoy each minute of the film it almost takes on a Christmas morning type quality as you wait to see the end product or if it can even be accomplished.

This film was nominated for best documentary last year and it's easy to see why. What's not easy to understand is how it lost. It is an amazing film that you won't want to miss and that you may want to revisit from time to time. That's something most documentaries can not lay claim to, multiple viewings. But this movie deserves that and more. On the downside it leaves you wondering what Jenison has up his sleeve next. It also makes you hope that both Penn and Teller do more items like this. Not only was this movie worth watching once, it is one that deserves a place on the front of your collection shelf.",1405468800,3,3109,4.409407665505227

I am an artist and photographer and there were so many art and photography topics in this documentary I decided to buy it so I could watch it often as the first go-through was mind bending, for me at least. If you think the documentary is about someone who decided to copy a Vermeer painting, you missed the point of the whole thing, as it is about how Vermeer achieved some of his effects, particularly how he reproduced the effects of light in his paintings and I need to go back and see it again, especially the part where there is a too short discussion of what the eye sees, versus what the camera ""sees"". I suspect that the casual observer might fall asleep after awhile, as it is pretty technical and moves along very fast. But for me it was a revelation.",1405209600,,1120,4.495098039215686

6200176,5,B00HR7OOME,"Truly fascinating. Whether or not Vermeer used a 'camera obscura', this is a great insight into the artistic process and artistic obsession.",1405123200,,140,5.409090909090909
6200177,2,B00HR7OOME,"What Tim has done is take the camera obscura/lucida (a well known invention, which Vermeer and other artists used for initial under painting), and made it into a mechanical human camera. It's sort of like his tedious, manual paint by numbers approach is duplicating a real cameras film emulsion that records the image in a fraction of a second, while he reproduces the film emulsion exposure by a slow laborious hand copy.

If you actually compare the real painting to Tim's effort, up close and side by side, you realize that there is no way that Vermeer used Tim's method. You can easily see that Vermeer's painting is actually painted, freehand, not through paint ""tracing"" like Tim did. Up close Tim's result look like a photo of the room, Vermeer's looks like a hand painted effort. If Vermeer used Tim's method, which he said any one can do, even with no art experience, then why doesn't Vermeer's result also look photo realistic, like Tim's up close?

In the film Tim points out a blue ""halo"" edge on one Vermeer painting as ""proof"" that Vermeer was using his lens photo method, saying that Vermeer was painting the camera color edge distortion that is seen in real photos called edge fringing. What he doesn't explain is that Vermeer used Ultramarine blue (lapis lapuzi) as a under painting and it can be seen in many other places in this painting and others, like in the lower right area of the oriental rug in the music lesson, but it isn't seen in Tim's painting at all, because he is reproducing the room view photographically, not actually painting as an artist.

The fact that Tim points out that some lines of the painting aren't parallel only points out that Vermeer probably did use the camera obscura for the initial drawing transfer to canvas/panel (probably with transparent, oil soaked paper, hence the lack of surviving drawings), not that he used Tim's photo mirror paint by numbers method which is actually related more to a camera lucida then a camera obscura.

It's very interesting to see some one turn them selves into a human camera, but it's demeaning to suggest that Vermeer had no talent and was simply a brilliant inventor/user of lens tricks and that anyone could do what he does with this equipment at their disposal. Also, great art is not just the process of painting, it is what the artist sees.. he creates a scene in his mind, rearranging objects on the canvas, or in Vermeer's method, physically setting up the scene in the room for the composition and lighting he wants and then painting it from his projected under painting where the human element of translation enters the picture.

I think Tim's main objective was to see if he could reproduce Vermeer's painting as photo realistically using technology & lenses. What he misses is that art isn't just about technical or inventive resources. If Tim had been told to come up with a really emotionally moving room interior view, using his trick lens set, I doubt it would have the impact that any of Vermeer's paintings have and he has even admitted it in interviews. Even his copy of the music lesson, though more photographic looking, with much more detail then Vermeer's painting, is missing a lot emotionally, it doesn't have the artist's imprint that makes Vermeer's work stand out. Conversely, if Vermeer had been introduced to Tim's lens set up, he may have been interested and at first amazed at the photo graphic result, but I doubt he would have been willing to put up with the painstaking, analytical, cold reproduction method that Tim had to use to create his painting copy, because, like most artists, he was more interested in the emotion of the result, not just the technical result. He might as well have spent all that time reproducing the music lesson room as he did and then just taken a photograph of it using a modern camera.. he would have gotten almost exactly the same results he got by his ridiculous painting process. but it still wouldn't have the emotional impact of a real Vermeer.

It's fitting that Tim chose to collaborate with Las Vegas magicians Penn & Teller for the production of this film.. that sort of says it all.",1405036800,3,4146,4.7354570637119116

It is also the story of a curious man, Tim Jenison, who becomes so absorbed with the question of ""how did Vermeer do this?"" that he follows every idea to its conclusion. He builds a replica of Vermeer's studio complete with live models and all the props included in a single painting and then paints ""his own Vermeer"" using an optical device that he suggests Vermeer might have used. All equipment and props are constructed and built using only materials that would have been available to Vermeer. Jenison is genuine and charming as well as wealthy enough to fund this project and to devote several years to its completion. His wealth is the result of his genius as an inventor and entrepreneur. It is a pleasure to watch this delightful eccentric as he becomes more and more obsessed and leaves no stone unturned in his quest for enlightenment, We will never know if Vermeer used this process, but it is possible.

Tim Jenison is a man with an abundance of intellectual curiosity and the talent and funds to pursue this idea.  The spark that set Tim off on his pursuit of this venture was a book by David Hockney, the well-known British artist, that purports to show that the art world was changed profoundly when optical instruments, lenses and mirrors, became generally available during the Renaissance.  Jenison produced an optical device similar to a camera lucida that enabled him to paint a ""Vermeer"" with no art instruction or schooling whatever.

Its quite interesting and I learned alot.  Mostly about obsession and the pursuit of fidelity... but also the secrets that may have been used by Vermeer. The film has a small yet diverse cast that most will recognize.  The video at times can be tedious to watch, but I was painting (Zbrush) at the time so its a great listen.  Artists may want to purchase vs rent or also buy the book version (have not read) as there is alot to asorb and the book also would be good for capturing some of the lessons and notes as details that may be lost in video.
Vermeer's job at hand was to recreate a world scene on canvas - 3d to 2d. He was a craftsman who used the best tools he had.
Vermeer apparently had the most advanced tools and knew how to use them, best. He was not a traditionalist, he was a pioneer.
Any tools he used is not a cheat because he was advancing the craft, just as the artist continues today.

6200211,5,B00HR7OOME,"I find this documentary so completely fascinating on so many levels. It blurs the line between technology geek and artist, and shows how someone that had never picked up a paint brush could paint a masterpiece. Tim shows how using technology available 350 years ago could allow an artist to achieve what Tim calls a ""human made photograph."" This movie is about Tim's ""science project."" He makes it quite clear that the procedure was torturous, and not ""cheating"" or a short cut. The painting took Tim 7 months to complete, and judging from the number of paintings in Vermeer's short life, it took Vermeer about 6 months to paint a painting. Tim has no desire to ever paint again.

As a person with aspirations of being an artist in retirement, this revelation of techniques used by a Dutch Master, who some call the greatest painter ever, gives me ""permission"" to use any technology I might choose to create art without feeling guilty or as though I'm ""cheating."" It seems that artists have always used whatever technology might be available to him or herself at any given time in history. I have watched this film three times so far, and enjoy all the ""special features."" I have also learned that actor / comedian Martin Mull, who I've always enjoyed, is an accomplished photo realist artist.

6200232,3,B00HR7OOME,"Tim's device is incredibly ingenious and it is amazing that he could produce what he did using the device, given his lack of talent or training in the field.  However, to suggest that the finished result comes anywhere close to a Vermeer is nonsense and this film avoids using the the opinions of 'experts' who may disagree with Jenison's theory.  I would imagine this would appeal to anyone who knows little about art history or art making, as the premise that Vermeer is somehow a one off in art history, simply isn't true.  And what of the realist artists who came after him and, not only documented their practices but taught others?  Dozens of 19th century Salon artists, orientalists, later photo-realists etc.  They were schooled in the 17th Century Dutch tradition and in many cases, their work was equally detailed.  To suggest that Vermeer's technique is somehow inhuman (as the film did while talking of the 'camera-like' light in the original) is like suggesting that Einstien secretly used a pocket calculator.  Vermeer WAS that talented and, more importantly, had an intellectual training that enabled him to realize what he was seeing.  Years and years of drawing from the cast, from life, leaning how to realize form in pencil, charcoal and eventually in paint.  A training, a journey.  The people in Mr Jenison's painting have no form - a common trait to projected drawing.  There is no paint quality whatsoever, nor use of brush stroke to describe form.  The painting is also devoid of glazing - the layering of thin washes of paint that give many of Vermeer's paintings the glow described in the film.  The way that Jenison applies paint is like a paint by numbers artist.

Another major point not addressed is that it wasn't some visual trick device that changed Medieval art into Renaissance art, but rationalism and the relaxing of the hold the Catholic church had over how artists worked.  The great works of the High Renaissance didn't just 'suddenly happen' but both painting and sculpture went through 200 years of a rational intellectual process that re-aquired the lost knowledge of the ancients and eventually led to masters like Vermeer, Velazquez etc in the 1500 and 1600s.  Also, to suggest that any Renaissance painting is even trying to be realistic in a photographic way is a nonsense.  The Italian Renaissance was always projecting an ideal - a model coupled with the artist's idea of perfect proportion.  The same is true of any painting of the 1600s.  These are not truly 'realistic' in our sense of the word.  The artist is perfecting reality.

Lastly, there is much talk here about 'convincing the experts'.  I thought, as a painter, Hockney looked distinctly unimpressed with the finished painting, though interested in the device.  As an art teacher (and painter) I recognized his silence followed by seizing on a part of the painting (that worked) to talk about as a recognition of someone's enthusiasm and effort, even if the end result is naive.  It's a bad painting.  I'm not an 'art snob' and I think any modern (or ancient) technology that helps with the process is fine - the end justifies the means.  Vermeer probably did use a camera obscura, but this was as an aid to his intellectual and technical genius, not a substitute.  Whilst interesting, this documentary is one-sided and entirely misleading.",1404172800,28,3352,4.907637655417407

6200240,5,B00HR7OOME,It is not your typical Penn & Teller outing as some seem to think.  It really focuses on Tim and his obsession with the Dutch artist.  As someone who is more into documentaries than painted art the film does a great job explaining the concepts and showing how Vermeer likely painted his works.  If you are convinced that Vermeer was some kind of genius and did not use any mechanical aids to paint then I think the film deserves your attention.

6200246,4,B00HR7OOME,"...because once the secret behind a magic trick is revealed, there really is little need to see the trick again.  Upon seeing it, you will understand immediately why a magician like Penn Jillette (of Penn & Teller fame) would take an interest in producing and directing a film about Vermeer, the Dutch Master, whose paintings far exceed in realism those of his contemporaries.  Of course, the film is just as much about Tim Jenison -- a name unknown to me prior to seeing this film -- whose genius is quite astounding.  That Tim and Penn have been lifelong friends -- a fact one learns early in the film -- makes perfect sense because Tim's genius is like that of a great magician.  Inspired by the David Hockney book ""Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Technique of the Old Masters"", Tim came to believe that there was some ""trick"" at the heart of the genius of Vermeer -- the kind of trick that is at the heart of much good magic.  I am trying to not give away what the trick is, because that would be a spoiler for this film.

The film is hugely thought provoking.  I, for one, am entirely convinced that Tim Jenison has discovered the secret of Vermeer, and that leaves me with a mix of feelings.  I cannot look at Vermeer in the same way.  If Tim Jenison is correct, then Vermeer's genius is that of a magician.  Like all great magicians, he guarded his secret so that none of his contemporaries knew how he did what he did, and it took another magician to uncover the secret 350 years later.  One gets the sense that both Penn Jillette and Tim Jenison want you to come away still regarding Vermeer with what wonder and affection you brought to his work initially.  Their dilemma is that of the magician:  If he reveals the trick to you, you are edified but no longer enchanted. Wonder and Naivety give way to Cynicism and Maturity.  Despite their protestations, it cannot be otherwise.  Magicians guard their secrets for good reason: They know that a part of you really _doesn't_ want to know how the trick is done.

""It's just a trick"" is the response that is the bane of the magician's existence.  The problem in that phrase is the word ""just"".  There is awe and splendor galore in the technology that makes magic possible.  If we think about it, the iPhone is an astoundingly magical device, and it would have seemed as such to anyone who would have been able to view it before its time as recently as 25 years ago.  But we tend to celebrate such achievements differently than we do those of an artist.  Penn and Tim want us to reconsider that distinction.  After all, those in the vanguard of the Enlightenment made achievements in both the Arts and Sciences -- Leonardo Da Vinci comes to mind. These disciplines were integrated within each of these great individuals, so why do we tend to separate them?  They have a point, and yet....

The questions with which I am left are these:  1) What distinguishes great art from great craft?, and 2) Was Vermeer a great artist or something else?  Watch this film to engage these questions, and you will be forever rewarded.

Highly recommended.",1404000000,34,3103,4.554151624548736

You still have to push the colors around alittle, and composition has always baffled me a bit, I believe you still have to be able to draw a little and an eye for color and composition helps too.

6200256,4,B00HR7OOME,"What is most impressive about this documentary is one man's singular focus on solving a technical and artistic question that had been plaguing him: how could Vermeer have achieved such photo realism in his paintings 150 years before the invention of the camera?  Tim Jenison is a wealthy entrepreneur, well versed in video and electronic technologies, with the financial wherewithal to pursue this question with a focus that borders on obsession.

After studying various Vermeer paintings, visiting with European scholars, and even viewing the original of Vermeer's ""The Music Lesson"" in Buckingham, Tim spent 213 days building an extremely detailed and accurate version of the set in a warehouse. Then he sat down at his painting table, with a mirror and handmade lenses, for 130 days to painstakingly reproduce the work of art. His friends, Penn and Teller, acted as producer and narrator for this documentary, and produced over 2,400 hours of film that had to be edited down to documentary length. It is astonishing to see the development of the paint on the canvas, stroke by stroke. Tim painted individual dots (knots) in the rug, which alone probably took him several weeks. The intricate design on the pianoforte was equally tedious to reproduce, but Tim never rushed through it or delegated any of the work. He did admit later that had he not committed to the documentary he probably would have bailed on the project during this tedious phase.

The end result is a beautiful copy that impressed even the experts, who admitted that, though this did not prove that Vermeer used lenses to project the scene onto his canvas for copying, it definitely ""could"" have been done this way. The mystery of the techniques used by Vermeer during his short life (43 years during which he was believed to have produced 34 paintings) will never be solved, but ""Tim's Vermeer"" certainly provides food for thought in the ongoing debate.",1403740800,,1926,4.993769470404985

6200260,5,B00HR7OOME,"It is rare to see a single person throw himself so completely into the entirety of a task of this complexity.  To say that Tim was passionate about this project is an understatement, as we see him personally painstakingly build nearly every element within the music lesson room with an unwavering eye for detail.  I found it fascinating to see the degree to which he researched every aspect of the painting, including building a mock up of the cathedral that sat outside the room --that is not even visible in the painting, but which would have influenced the lighting in the painting!

Then we get to watch him bring the room to life on the canvas.  The concept of the mirror device --to alter the painting until the edge of the mirror disappears-- is so simple and objective, it sounds deceptively easy to render an exact two-dimensional image of the actual room.  Yet, we find out that he can see so much detail that the process is incredibly time-consuming.  His final reveal of the work is stunning.

Is this the way Vermeer created his paintings?  Though nothing conclusive is proven, it does seem to suggest that a painting with that much detail requires some device external to the human eye.",1403654400,2,1200,4.680952380952381

6200274,5,B00HR7OOME,"As I post this review (in June 2014) there are already 78 reviews posted. That is partly because of Amazons policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a title including the theatrical version and the Amazon streaming version  neither of which has the special features. Thats an important point  especially with this film (read on for more). So I always recommend that customers sort the reviews by Newest Date first and then note both the date of the review and the format being reviewed. That said, on to the Blu-ray combo pack:

This is a Penn & Teller collaboration but it is not like their comedy/magic nightclub act. Penn Jillette spent 5 years producing and co-directing the 2005 documentary The Aristocrats  (about a very dirty joke) and shortly thereafter his  friend Tim Jenison (a computer graphic designer) mentioned an experiment he wanted to do re: copying a painting by the 17th Century Dutch artist Vermeer.  This led to Jilette bringing in another producer from his own film, and getting his partner Teller to direct a six-year long production documenting Jenisons project. Ill let other reviews tell you more about Jenison but I will say that this film (and, more importantly the home video release) could be subtitled Obsession. Here is why:

In addition to the 79 minute film (which encapsulates the six yearlong project), the Bluray contains more bonus material than I can remember on a BD or DVD in a long time. First is the full length commentary track featuring Jenison,  Producer Farley Ziegler, Jilette and Teller. (YES, Teller talks here!), There is a Q&A from the Toronto Film Festival with the same folks (and yes, Teller talks here too!) which runs 22 minutes) Then come the seven deleted scenes (another 22 minutes) most of which are comedy bits with Penn or Penn AND Teller. Lastly there are five extended or alternate scenes.  That doesnt seem like a lot until you realize that they add another two hours and 18 minutes of material! The section with comedian Martin Mull (here as an artist friend of Jenison  no comedy this time) runs 48 minutes with Jenisons self-filmed early experiments lasting another 40 minutes!)

To be honest, I did not make it through all the commentary track and only partially watched the extended scenes bonus.  But its here if you have the time to watch it.  So there is over  four hours of material here supplementing the reasonably short 78-minute film.

I found the film fascinating and any person interested in art will too.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6200275,3,B00HR7OOME,"The premise of the movie is that Vermeer used mechanical tools to help him achieve his extraordinary results. Yeah, so what? Nearly every artist of that era did. The idea that many famous painters used the camera obscura and its derivations to help them achieve realism is a basic concept of art history. That concept is nothing new and to make such a big deal about seems like a serious waste of 1.5 hours. It's like discovering that Ansel Adams used dodging and burning in the darkroom.

6200287,1,B00HR7OOME,"This movie makes some really basic errors about painting.

For example, take the part in the film where they show the two gray squares at a distance and claim that only a superhuman retina could see the difference in values. If you pause the film and squint, it's easy to see the 'absolute brightness' (as they call it), i.e. the difference in value between the two squares, even when they are far apart. You might have to squint way down, but that's what painters do to get their values right.

Squinting is a basic part of the artistic process. As Penn Jillette states in the film, the optic nerve has less bandwidth than the eye, so it doesn't send information about correct values to the brain. If you squint, you're reducing the amount of light entering the eye and reducing the amount of detail entering the eye. Thus allowing the artistically important part about values to be the information passed through the optic nerve to the brain.

In another moment Tim Jenison shows the soft edge on the back of the figure in Woman in Blue Reading a Letter as an example of a lens-created 'chromatic aberration'. But artists blur edges, especially on a plane which turns away from the eye. They've been softening edges since the egg-tempera days. Vermeer, like every great realist painter, was a master of variety in his edges. Some are sharp, some are soft, and some are really, really soft (look at the edges of the clouds in the View of Delft).

In fact, the main problem with Mr. Jenison's finished painting is that he has paid so little attention to his edges. They're all the same. This is a really basic error in oil painting.

My question while watching this movie was: Why wouldn't they ask a working realist painter some of this stuff?

There are plenty of artists today who can paint incredibly realistic images without using optical tools. Look at Antonio Lopez Garcia, Richard Maury, or Jacob Collins. Why not talk to one of them?

I can't help but feel that Mr. Jenison could have made a much better copy of 'his' Vermeer with some proper artistic guidance.

(For the record, I have nothing against dilettantism. I just don't think it makes for a very informative documentary.)",1403395200,25,2190,4.67012987012987
6200288,2,B00HR7OOME,"This is good entertainment, but this film makes some very wild claims.

Jenison's experiment does confirm Steadman's hypothesis that Vermeer must have had access to lenses, and most probably used a camera obscura in the production of his pictures.
However, the idea that Vermeer would have used such a complicated set-up is far-fetched. Jenison paints on Masonite and uses modern brushes and modern mirrors. He has traced outlines in pencil and has tried to work 'all in one go' using one layer of paint, applied dot by dot.

There has been considerable scientific and historical research which shows that Vermeer did not paint this way, and that his underpaintings have little evidence of line. Like other artists of his time he worked in stages, waiting for each layer to dry before progressing to the next. On top of a knifed ground on his canvas he applied an underpainting, and then a layer of cheap earth colours. Then he 'worked up' using brighter, more expensive colours in scumbles and glazes before 'varnishing' his canvas with oil.

To compare Jenison's end result with Vermeer's is like comparing a 3D print-out of an iphone with the real thing: the outside might bear some comparison, but it is a dead, hollow copy.

I have experimented in my studio and found a way Vermeer could have transferred images from a camera obscura projection without the use of mirrors. Using authentic materials, it is possible to trace in paint and transfer this to a prepared canvas. This corrects the image and produces 'prints' on the ground layer without lines, very like Vermeer's own underpainting. These results have been recently published in the academic journal 'Art and Perception', and are freely available on my website (search for 'Printed Light').

6200289,5,B00HR7OOME,"Vermeer, the painter of light, is one of my very favorite artists. I say this with no small amount of green-eyed jealousy having long ago judged my talent for painting childlike by comparison. It is therefore with glee, altho just as much wonder, that I witnessed this ""science"" to his art. The extreme discipline and sheer hard work needed for this meticulous method nonetheless added another layer of admiration for Vermeer and for Tim. Two extremely, if slightly possessed, intelligent and curious men it would seem. If you love Vermeer and the science of discovery watch this!!",1403308800,3,581,5.0
6200290,4,B00HR7OOME,"In this film, we meet Tim Jenison, a technology executive, who has become obsessed with proving that in the 1600's Vermeer used lenses and mirrors to create his paintings mechanically. He decides to prove his hypothesis by taking on the daunting and painstaking task of creating a precise copy of one of Vermeer's paintings using the techniques he comes to believe were used by Vermeer, even though he is not an artist and knows next to nothing about painting. With the help of his friends, Penn & Teller, Tim's efforts to create his own ""Vermeer"" painting are chronicled in this film.
Tim's Vermeer is based on Tim's further research of ideas first presented by David Hockney: ""In David Hockney's 2001 television programme and book, Secret Knowledge, Hockney posited that the Old Masters used camera obscura techniques that projected the image of the subject onto the surface of the painting ... and is the reason for the photographic style of painting we see in the Renaissance and later periods of art. (excerpted from the Wikipedia article on David Hockney)""

Tim jumps into the project with both feet. He recreates the complete setting of a Vermeer painting inside a rented warehouse and uses period tools and equipment to create his copy of the work. He even mixes his own paints using formulas from the 1600s.

As a techie with some obsessions of my own, I enjoyed the film and highly recommend it.",1403308800,2,1405,4.85

6200299,5,B00HR7OOME,"This is an unusual documentary directed by no less than Teller of Penn & Teller fame that seeks to examine how Vermeer produced his paintings. Tim Jenison is a Texas-based inventor who had become obsessed with the idea of creating a Vermeer without any artistic training or skills and examines the optical technology available at the time that may have been used in the production of the paintings.

The premise is fascinating. What do we know about Vermeer? According to the documentary, X-rays of his paintings indicate no sketches at all under the work and there are no records of any training under contemporary Dutch painters. Creating 3-4 paintings a year, his unique photo-realistic style is still a mystery as to how he achieved the production at all and he remains one of the most enigmatic artists in history.

Over a five year period, Jenison builds a optical mechanism and reconstructs the environment of Vermeer's house that enables him to create a Vermeer-like painting using methods he believes the artist used. Built upon existing academic theories, he exhaustively addresses and solves each challenge presented in reverse-engineering this bizarre project. These issues, such as the curvature caused by lens flaws and the color changes on a wall not visible to a human eye, reinforce the idea that Vermeer's work was produced by more than hand alone.

It's rare that I get excited about documentaries but watching Tim Vermeer was like discovering the inner workings of an elaborate magic trick. It shows that the artificial line between technology and art can be blurred to the point of non-existence and how a determined mind that refuses to accept explanations on face value can solve even the most seemingly impossible problems. The painstaking work involved shows that even if Vermeer had used a method such as Tim's, it's still a remarkable achievement that illustrates the unique gifts of the artist.

So did Vermeer use optics to paint? The reaction to Tim's work and this documentary has been fascinating. Some like the elegance of Tim's solution proposed here, while others feel he has done nothing more than create the equivalent of a Photoshop effect that devalues Vermeer and his work. Whatever your position, one thing is for sure - Tim Jenison will forever change the way you look at Vermeer's paintings and poses a nagging question. Is his work the product of spontaneous artistic genius or a brilliant, time-consuming mechanical method?",1403222400,,2468,5.071428571428571

Rather than extol its virtues as others have already done I'll point out the few flaws as I see them.

How do they explain Vermeer's outdoor portraits? Maybe there is a very good explanation (such as he painted the outside while sitting inside) but no effort is made to explain this. Also, show us a very good side by side of his painting against a Vermeer print. I couldn't tell at the end how close Tim got to the original although I think he clearly created a Vermeer style.

I also would like to hear some skeptics. Interview someone who dislikes this kind of thinking rather than those who will likely agree.

Finally, I think every time they showed a completed work, Penn should intone, ""remember, this man DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO PAINT"".

6200319,4,B00HR7OOME,"Tim Jenison already conquered one field, helping to invent the ""Video Toaster"" that made CG effects attractive and affordable for many television and film productions.  But something nagged at him: though composing CG effects clearly required an aesthetic sense, neither he nor the products' users were called ""artists;""  he was called an ""inventor,"" whereas users were called ""technicians.""  This rankled him, and he set out to correct it.

He knew that the great Dutch artist Vermeer had produced his masterpieces with the help of a ""camera oscura.""  Art historians had been saying that the photographic realism of Vermeer's works must have been a product of that influence.  It had always been assumed however, that Vermeer merely used the images from the primitive proto-camera as a reference, not as a guide.  Jenison spent several years of his life trying to prove that Vermeer worked directly with the reflected image as the underpinning of his work.

Though this documentary - hosted by magicians Penn and Teller - is an interesting detective story, it is the psychological aspects of the story that are very powerful.  Jenison is on a crusade, trying to bring Vermeer to his level in order to earn respect.  The camera not only records the Herculean lengths that Jenison goes to in order to re-create a Vermeer masterpiece using his optical techniques, but it records the agony and determination of the creative process.  When Jenison finally faces what he has wrought, we are feeling it with him.  For anyone with the compulsion to create, it is a worthwhile experience.",1402790400,2,1580,5.057915057915058

6200322,2,B00HR7OOME,"I'm giving this two stars because it was fun to hear Smoke on the Water played on a viola da gamba. But fun as it is, it isn't enough to compensate for the film's pretensions.

The one-star reviewer covered the major technical flaws very well. No point rehashing them.

This is a paean to Tim Jenison's ego, which is madly stroked by every one of the other participants. Watching it, you would think no one had ever done a technical analysis of Vermeer before Jenison had a vision of the miracle gadget while he was taking a bath, as Doc Brown had a vision of the Flux Capacitor after falling off the toilet. Jenison's arbitrary division between art and technology is bogus. Artists have always taken advantage of whatever technology was available to them. Entire books have been written about it, for example by Gettens and Stout. The movie is also irritatingly cute, especially the obnoxious soundtrack, Smoke on the Water aside.

Is it possible Vermeer used such a device? Sure, it's possible, in a limited way. But is it likely that he sat there for hour after excruciating hour painting exclusively with teensy-weensy brushes? Where's the badger blender?

In one way, Jenison is totally honest. He reminds us many times that he isn't a painter. That's for sure.

How could Vermeer possibly have painted View of Delft this way?",1402790400,3,1331,4.769565217391304

6200325,4,B00HR7OOME,"As a portrait artist who paints realism I can't imagine spending the hours Mr. Jenison did on this. I have to hand it to him. It was quite an accomplishment for an untrained artist to complete it. But here's the thing for me; if I had wanted to do this I think it would have been the tool needed. However, for the most part I think it's a starting point to ensure accuracy but that's where it would stop. I think the skill of an accomplished artist like Vermeer would have used it only when he had to and relied on experience most likely learned as an apprentice under a master. Doing paintings with the immense work ethic of Mr. Jenison would have taken the joy out of it for me. I was skeptical of his assessment up until the curving seahorses and now along with Hockney's research it's pretty conclusive to my mind. The film is a worthwhile watch and an interesting ride of insight into one of the finest artists the world has known. I wanted to see a side by side comparison though. And as a side note his use of his daughter in the piece was great. What a sweet face.

I watched this a second time. Now I'm not convinced that Vermeer was so much a schooled artist after all but rather a technician that enabled him to become the equivalent of the first real camera; not dependent on chemistry affected by light but putting down paint accurately enough to render a virtual copy. To his credit he had great taste in composition and very pleasing subject matter. I don't think it was uncommon to take long periods to paint a complete painting and even today there are artists who devote great amounts of time to a piece. But, as Tim Jenison demonstrated, a third of a year at the task would make most people not attempt it this way. Now I'm really curious to compare notes on Norman Rockwell and Eakins because they used photography prominently in their work. And now ultra realism is a recognized art form that surpasses what Vermeer did. What's that saying ""the future is past""? Intriguing movie.",1402704000,4,2000,4.434782608695652

Certainly scenes like Tim's sawing the lathe in two to extend the table leg 2-4 inches was totally unnecessary, and with a good editor, could have been reduced in time and to its bare essential message.  The film could have been more documentary about the central subject of the technique, which was fascinating, and less about the characters, which were much less fascinating.",1402704000,2,727,4.9105691056910565

His love of Vermeer led him to recreate the master's possible methods and in the process become an artist himself - while rediscovering things about painting and optics that had long been lost.

Vermeer was a working professional.  If someone else discovered his technology for capturing light in paint, he would no longer have been able to make a living.  Publishing the then-cutting-edge secrets of optics for possible competitors to use and take advantage of in a world without patents would have been career suicide - which is why the historical record is so scanty.

One of the most different documentary films I have ever seen about a subject that I never thought of.  What painters did back 3-400 years ago was always brilliant despite the lack of technology that existed at the time.

6200333,5,B00HR7OOME,"All right, I really liked it, but I have a question.  As I understood the concept, Tim painted in the same way that a scanner scans.  When the mirror moved over a shade of red, Tim duplicated that same shade until the edge of the mirror ""disappeared.""  When Tim saw a white spot in the mirror, he painted an identical white spot on the canvas.  So far so good - I almost understand that.
Here's my question.  At 1 hour and 1 minute into the documentary, you see the girl's red dress all the way to the floor.  Fine.  But then Tim paints a viola that covers the bottom of the red dress and part of the floor.  Had he been painting as a scanner scans or a camera photographs, those objects, now hidden by the viola (portions of the dress and the floor), would not have been visible to Tim or to Vermeer.  Even if Vermeer had put the viola in the painting at the last minute and Tim had access to an x-ray that exposed the painted over area, the colors in the dress and the floor design could only be guessed at.
So Tim, if you are reading this, how did the dress hang all the way to the floor when its bottom was hidden by the viola?",1402617600,3,1131,4.081447963800905

Tim accomplishes, through sheer elbow work and ingenuity, a very convincing reproduction of a Vermeer.  Beyond simply coming up with an effective optical technique for accurately reproducing color and tone in a painting, he goes beyond that and actually builds a reproduction of Vermeer's studio, and then attempts to recreate the same lighting angles and shadows as in the original painting.

Even if you refuse be convinced that a long-lost painting technique has been resurrected, the sheer inventiveness of the whole process is quite captivating.",1402617600,,807,5.28125

Sometimes ""obsession"" has a negative connotation.  Tim's obsession is anything but negative -- it's inspiring.

Watching a guy create a painting doesn't sound very interesting, but after you see the creativity, ingenuity, research, and work that goes into creating the masterpiece you'll be glad you watched this film.

In a typical year I watch around 100 documentary films.  This is one of my favorites.",1402444800,,366,4.761904761904762
6200342,5,B00HR7OOME,"The graphics geek in me wants to say that this is the Greatest Art Documentary Ever Made. Penn & Teller's film takes you on an 1,850-day journey where NewTek's Tim Jenison (Amiga VideoToaster and Lightwave 3D fame) attempts to recreate ""The Music Lesson"", one of the famous photorealistic oil paintings of the 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer.

But Tim has an optical cheat - one that he suspects the other Dutch Masters in Vermeer's class may have used as well. Nonetheless, it takes four solid months of mindless perfectionism for Tim to recreate the Queen of England's artwork, from a meticulously crafted handbuilt recreation of Vermeer's original room. The girl at the harpsichord is modelled by his (now fully grown) daughter, whom Amiga fans might recognize as the stunning preschooler whose bundled scan helped sell a million NewTek DigiPaints.

The clincher is that Tim Jenison's optical device (and his oil-based recreation created with its help) revealed subtle distortions that turned out to be... also in the Dutch Master's original. Not that Tim knew at the time, however - Mind Blown.",1402444800,12,1109,5.121546961325967
6200343,5,B00HR7OOME,"Tim Jenison is something like Steve Wozniak in desktop video. He created NewTek company and like Woz was able to do all the initial hard work by himself from the hardware to the software. And become wealthy in the process while his company becomes self running empire that doesn't need him.
And now with his time and money he is looking for a new way to engage his obsession for detail in a world that is obsessed with likes and followers.
I really like this guy.
So he sees Vermeer paintings in the gallery and being a desktop video guru and former engineer who can't paint he obviously thinks that this is no way painted without some mechanical aid. Nobody can be that good, right?

In the process of proving his smartly modified camera obscura/lucida theory he recreates the whole scene from Vermeer painting in real life, travelling back and forth to Netherlands to measure things, having the exact pottery made, getting the patterns and textures, making the exact replica of the furniture. But it doesn't stop there, he start making his own lens and of course making his own oil paint from the exact ingredients of Vermeer era. And time flies.

Obsession makes a great documentary. It gives us a view into Tims head but hardly any view into Vermeers.

Movie plus:
- he doesn't verbally claim authority over the topics he knows little, this is pure engineering exercise and he tries to make that clear despite jumping into wrong conclusion
- he does really recreates the scene and light to the last detail - this is not a painting from a photo, this is painting from the real deal (despite the artificial lighting)
- he uses mostly materials available at the time of Vermeer, no computer or modern photo trickery
- he is down to earth, practical and almost humble guy - a novelty with the kind of people flying private jets
- he is very likeable and you see that after months painting ""pixels"" he would love to quit only if he didn't agree to make the darn movie
- he proves 100% that it is doable (but not that an artist would or even want to use this technique)
- he brings Vermeer to attention

Controversial topics:

- Vermeer seems to paint in dead layer (underglaze) technique or so most scholars of today believe, he doesn't mention that or even show he is aware of that. That means he is not trying to paint using what is believed to be the correct technique of the era but inventing his own painting technique

- He doesn't talk to experts on Vermeer painting technique which is puzzling but I guess it is to emphasize the tone of the movie. A simple talk with a real Vermeer expert would bring a lot of small issues and controversies with Tims approach. For example to this day we can see little hole in the girls bright arm from the pin that hold strings to create a very precise linear perspective of the image with vanishing point at that hole. While it is often said vermeer placed exact brush strokes exactly and then leave them there, the fact is that x ray show he would repaint crucial parts of the image for better effect: the man was moved to the right, the girls head was originally turned towards him. The mirror reflection do not correspond to the correct head placement and vermeer would add and remove shadows not to be photographically accurate but for the best visual effect (for example there is no shadow of the harpsichord on the back wall, just its legs and they are not accurately placed either). And an expert can go on and on about tiny little details that do not fit the photo-copy technique of Tims.

- Tim makes the device look a very simple to use but he doesn't mention the fact that you can move your head only in the direction towards the lens or away from it , the other direction (left to right) has to be deadly still in the middle of the mirror because the image in mirror moves in the opposite direction. Also you can't just move the mirror where you need it, moving it closer or further to the lens will make the projected image bigger or smaller and nothing will fit anymore. I still honestly don't know how he managed to paint the borders of the image using his mirror technique. And also they didn't really spelled the fact that he was painting it looking at it on the side. Also a tiny miscalculation in the angle and the mirror would make the image squished on one top and enlarged on bottom or vice versa. It is just extremely painful way to paint this way where you can move your head in only one direction. Honestly a good painter would break his mirror after few hours and just paint it normal way.

- Tim didn't make any effort to look at how any good painter paints, he simply assumes that because he cannot paint himself, nobody can paint image like vermeer without mechanical aid. This is simply wrong. Maybe he can spend some time watching how a really good artist work and he may be amazed that some people are actually really, really good at it. He is at the end of the movie 90% convinced that this is similar how Vermeer painted, disregarding the fact that he painted his version the most torturing way, sitting in precise spot with the image on its side, with the canvas in horizontal position.
If real painters painted this way, we would have very little art to put in any museums as they would be dead after few paintings. The Vermeer own portrait image in Artist in his Studio shows pretty much how he and other painters painted in his era.

- Tim didn't mention nor knows that using mirrors and two reflecting mirrors was a technique used by Vermeers peers and likely by Vermeer. Looking at the scene through two mirrors allows for better judgement of colors (especially because 17th century mirrors will dampen the light dynamics to more photography compressed like image). As a homework there is Vermeer image that clearly shows use of the mirror. Can you find it?

- the movie kind of suggest it is either/or deal. Either Vermeer didn't use this technique and he was an humanly impossible painter or he used it fully and so he was more of a brilliant engineer (this was actually spelled out by Tim and also in interviews). It is extremely flawed view IMHO and Tim as an engineer should know that. You don't stick with a single technique for the sake of it, you always use what is the most cost effective method at any time regardless if you are dutch painter or an american engineer. And for many great painters, just simple painting is the most effective method without constant using gizmos.

As for the movie I was very pleased with the chosen subject, but it would be wrong to take it more than it is. It is not a scholarly study how Vermeer painted. Tim may re-invent one of the optical technique the painters of the era ""could"" have used (the optics were very ""in"" at that time) in their toolbox but I really doubt about practical use. It is fine for Tim but it is a torture for a real painter.
I really like Tim and he painted a very good painting (the turkish carpet on Tim's is an phenomenal work btw)
but it is kind of hard to extrapolate that to the Vermeer as his ""lost secret"". Yes we can find areas of paintings which would be obvious candidates for using such gizmo (like the various patterns on the Music lesson) and it is very likely many optical gizmos including camera obscura were used, but so we can find paintings where such tool would be highly impractical or impossible (View of Delft for example) and then we are back to the thesis that someone had to paint them from the head and the someone had to be very good at it.",1401580800,13,7521,4.454611474219317
