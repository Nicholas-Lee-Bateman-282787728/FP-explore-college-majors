GRAND HOTEL is a screen adaptation of a stageplay based on Vicki Baum's 1929 novel, ""Menschen im Hotel.""  As is mentioned, there's a ""Grand Hotel"" in every major European city.

The story opens and closes with an on-call physician's blas comment about the boring state of affairs at Grand Hotel. We soon learn how wrong his assessment is, for several lives briefly and serendipitously intertwine at the famous Berlin hostel. No one would leave GH totally unchanged by their experiences.

A top-shelf MGM cast make this Best Picture Oscar-winner always interesting. It's a must-see for all classic era film lovers if only to hear Garbo's legendary line, ""I vant to be alone!""
