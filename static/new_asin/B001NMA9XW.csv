8327350,2,B001NMA9XW,"Doesnt explain nearly enough the complete routine of good reliable Skeet shooting. Way, way too many recommendations by customers, which does nothing to train me, but makes John sound fantastic. Who cares !!",1396656000,,207,5.303030303030303
8327351,2,B001NMA9XW,"Shima presents good insights and interesting ideas. However, the video does not provide enough concrete and useful instruction. Way too much time is spent by shooters he has trained giving testimonials about how much they learned from him. Seems like you need to take his lessons, you sure can't improve your shooting from simply watching this video. p.s. I read a review like this before I bought the video. I did not believe that review. I wish I had saved my money.",1261958400,4,468,4.719512195121951
8327352,1,B001NMA9XW,"My mother purchased this for me and I have returned it,without viewing.
Several friends have it and feel that it is overpriced for the content.

8327353,2,B001NMA9XW,After reading other reviews and knowing what kind of shooter the author is I was expecting a self help video with some tried and true fixes for shooting problems.  The video does gloss over a few techniques however it's mostly interviews of shooters that have taken Shima's classes and how much they learned at those classes.  I wish I had saved the money for the video so I could afford to go to one of his classes.,1242000000,,416,4.3896103896103895
8327354,5,B001NMA9XW,EXCELLENT! John's subject and presentation is very informative and watchable. I have watched it several times and learned something new or more thoroughly each time. I highly recommend it.  Joanne Terrell,1241827200,,204,5.580645161290323
8327355,2,B001NMA9XW,"Although there are a few pearls contained in the video, I was disappointed in the overall content. Music was too loud and solid pointers too few. Shima is a great shooter and more was expected of him. I understand his clinics are wonderful, but this was not one of them.",1240358400,,270,4.42
8327356,2,B001NMA9XW,The least informative DVD on skeet shooting I have ever viewed. Almost as boring as Todd Bender's DVDs.,1240099200,,103,4.777777777777778
8327357,5,B001NMA9XW,"1.  John Shima knows what he is talking about.
2.  Watch the DVD at least 3 to 6 times.
3.  It takes some time to get used to shooting with a patch.
4.  It helps to relax for a couple of seconds before calling for the target.
5.  I do have to say that lessons, in person, is still better than the DVD. : )
6.  I will be taking lessons from John Shima and Todd Bender in 2 days from writing this review.",1236902400,,402,3.7261904761904763
8327358,4,B001NMA9XW,"Not for the beginning shooter but if you have viewed the Bender DVD's on Skeet and still have inexplicable misses, you should view this DVD. Does not show a lot of how-to shooting technique but explains really well how the eyes work. The concept of heads up shooting to me was quite mind blowing. Totally against convention. [2010 Update] As an update I bought this video in Feb 09 and in Dec 09 shot my first 25 straight! As I said not a DVD for the beginner but certainly Heads Up Shooting worked for me and for a friend as well. He's a better shot than me and has shot many 25 straights HUS. Now I shoot with a solid patch & HUS. Would never have tried this concept but for this DVD.",1235779200,5,686,4.165413533834586
