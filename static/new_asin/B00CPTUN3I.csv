5734566,2,B00CPTUN3I,"Don Malek (Stephen Geoffreys) is a professional screen writer and amateur surgeon and vigilante. In the opening scene he torture/kills his screen producer while having flashbacks to a woman. He shares his crime with his understanding agent (Tiffany Shepis) who didn't like the producer either. Don stays at a dive hotel in the high crime area of town for the ambiance of his writing.

Outside of the killing, Don is rather dull. Tiffany Shepis is a more animated character, but wasn't enough to carry the film. The movie ended at an interesting point, one that should have happened about 30 minutes into the film. The dullness of Don's character made the film slow and lifeless.

A low end rental at best. Released in 2010 as ""New Terminal Hotel"" now making its way around Redbox with a new title.

Had high hopes for it after seeing Stephen in SICK GIRL (an amazing film)
Sadly after a half hour I couldn't take it anymore
Shocked I lasted that long, kept hoping it would payoff.
Stephen is an amazing actor and person he deserved better",1520726400,,280,4.62

8584848,1,B00CPTUN3I,"This was absolutely terrible. When the movie started, I had to check to see if it had somehow started in the middle. There is no introduction to the story and characters, it just starts abruptly. The characters are unlikable. The actors are terrible. Everyone seems to be yelling rather than speaking. The over acting is unbelievable. The story line is overused and overdone.
Within ten minutes I was bored, but I gave it another twenty minutes, a decision I regret. I couldn't bear to watch this to the end.",1417478400,,508,4.719101123595506
8584849,5,B00CPTUN3I,"I found this to be a surprisingly strong head-trip thriller with overtones of horror. As I've said before, some of the best scary situations come from writers plumbing their own depths in search of inspirationthe Shining, Don't Look Back, Synecdoche, New York.
I must admit, I felt lost a couple times, but only briefly. If the movie has one flaw it is that the pacing is just a bit tepid in the first two acts, but that's a minor quibble with a movie that has such a strong, solid, coherent class. My expectations were low based on reviews, and there were few clich hints leading me down predictable paths.",1416700800,2,607,4.577981651376147

8584854,4,B00CPTUN3I,"Any regular reader of my reviews knows that I am madly in love with Tiffany Shepis (THE FRANKENSTEIN SYNDROME - 2010; THE VIOLENT KIND - 2010). She is such a great actress (and easy on the eyes, too) that she elevates any film she appears in, even if it is just a cameo role. One of the biggest mysteries in life is why she hasn't become a major star in A-List Hollywood films. Besides being a great actress, she has no problem shedding her clothes if the role demands it (even showing the full monty in several films), but she won't play the usual Hollywood ""casting couch"" game, so this is probably why she hasn't been offered roles in major films. I just thank my lucky stars that she does a whole lot of genre films, because I love to look at her and watch her act her brains out (and she has scruples, which more actors could use). I know I'm not the only one to feel that way, but she has held a special place in my heart ever since I saw her in that silver jumpsuit in THE HAZING (2004) and then went out of my way to try and find every movie she appeared in. Thankfully, she has a major role in this film, although it is nothing like the DVD sleeve describes. First, a little background on this film: This film was shot and finished in 2008 (Shepis was engaged to the late Corey Haim at the time and she brought him along on the shoot in Pennsylvania. Haim asked if the script had a role for him, but there wasn't, so the director/screenwriter wrote a role specifically for him.) and released in 2010 under the title NEW TERMINAL HOTEL, which ran 99 minutes. The film was then pulled and cut of 11 minutes to tighten the pace and released in 2013 under the current title (the end credits gives it a 2013 copyright, even though Corey Haim tragically passed away of pneumonia in 2010). The film begins with screenwriter Don Malek (Stephen Geoffreys; FRIGHT NIGHT - 1985; MR. HUSH - 2011), who has been in a career slump for the past two years due to the tragic murder of the love of his life, Katherin (Laura Leigh), and hasn't written a single word since it has happened. Don finally gets his chance for retribution when Stan Glissberg (Anthony Colliano), the person responsible for Katherin's death, agrees to meet Don at his room the Terminal Hotel (a skid row type of joint where you can just smell the piss in the hallways). Stan arrives and Don lays out a couple of lines of cocaine for him and when Stan snorts them, he becomes paralyzed, because Don laced the cocaine with a paralytic agent. He puts Stan in the bathtub and removes his appendix while he is alive and puts the organ in his freezer wrapped in tin foil (Don wears a mask of a human face and a blonde wig when he commits acts of violence), stitching up the incision when he is done. Don's agent, Ava Collins (Shepis), who still has faith in Don, even though he hasn't written anything in two years, makes an unexpected appearance at Don's door and wants to know why he is living in a fleabag hotel. All Don can say is, ""I'm tired"", which infuriates Ava because she knows what potential he has. She tries to get his blood boiling by saying ""There are a line of good writers waiting to fill your shoes."", but Don retorts, ""Are they any good?"" Ava comes back by saying that she could throw a stone and find a great writer, but Don says, ""What about a Killer? Could you find a great killer?"" Things take a sharp turn when Don Tells Ava to go look in the bathroom (Don: ""It's my greatest work.""  Ava: ""Do you want me to flush it for you?""). Ava sees Stan in the bathtub filled with ice, still alive, but unable to speak, and she thinks Don and Stan are collaborating on a script when Don shows her the appendix in his freezer. She wants to see Don and Stan in her office tomorrow morning to sign an exclusive contract, but Don says that she has to come back to the hotel tomorrow night instead. Ava leaves and Don goes back to the bathroom, where he removes one of Stan's kidneys and stitches up the incision. Don plans on keeping Stan alive as long as possible, feeling the pain that his love once felt. Ava arrives the next night expecting to be handed a script, but Stan comes stumbling out of the bathroom and Ava maces Don in his eyes because she is scared for her life. Don assures Ava that he means her no harm (He tells Ava that he is doing to Stan what Stan has done to him: Tearing him down piece-by-piece for the past two years). When Ava leaves, saying she expects a screenplay about his ordeal, Don takes Stan back to the bathroom and hits him over his head several times until he is still alive, but basically brain dead. He asks his neighbor Spitz (Ezra Buzzington) for a major favor: He wants to borrow his wheelchair (he is legless from the war), where he wheels the braindead Stan to the hospital and drops him off, returning the wheelchair to Spitz, where Stan is barely alive and put in Intensive Care. Ava visits Don (he makes her take her shirt off to make sure she is not wired, the closest we get to see Shepis nude in this film), where she is worried that once Stan becomes conscious, he will implicate Don, but Don tells her not to worry; he will never be able to say anything. Ava thinks this screenplay will be a huge moneymaker for her when Don writes the screenplay, but Don tells her he hasn't written a word yet, it is still all in his head. Later that night, Spitz wheels himself into Don's apartment with a huge open gash on his chest and says he is calling in the favor. He wants Don to kill the prostitute he was with because she is the one who cut him badly. Spitz wants Don to take her behind the hotel and bash her brains in with a brick. Don checks out Spitz's room and the naked prostitute is still there and tells Don that Spitz is a degenerate. Don pays her the $100 she is owed and tells her to leave, while Don checks out Spitz's apartment and discovers that he is actually a degenerate. He finds boxes of mutilated Barbie dolls and videotapes of Spitz abusing the prostitutes he hires, including the last one he just let leave (Don is appalled at what he sees on-screen). Don goes back to his apartment and begins to stitch-up Spitz's gaping chest wound, while listening to Spitz complain about his time in the military and what happened to him (""All I can do now is eat p***y. And I have to pay for it!""). Don mentions the torture tapes he found in Spitz's apartment, where Spitz says he actually is fond of them and watches them all the time. Don then gives Spitz a shot that he says is a pain killer, but after Don gives it to him, he tells Spitz that it is actually a paralyzing agent. Spitz will be unable to move but will be able to see and feel everything. Spitz begins to wheel himself out of Don's apartment, but only makes it halfway down the hall before the drug takes effect. Don brings him to his bathroom, puts on his face mask and blonde wig, throws Spitz into the bathtub and cuts him into pieces while he is alive (The film's biggest flaw is that we don't actually see any of the murders; they are only implied. Only once in a while do we see the aftermath, like when Don removed Stan's kidney). When another agent named Carter Ball (James Grabowski) wants to steal Don away from Ava (We also learn that Stan died in the hospital), Ana sets it up so Carter visits Don, expecting Don to kill him. Another one of Don's neighbors, Jasper (Haim, doing the lamest British accent I have heard in a while), mentions that he saw Don wearing his mask and wig when he was wheeling Stan down the hallway, so Don has no other choice but to beat his brains in with a rock when they leave a bar. Don returns to his apartment, only to discover that the police have taped-up his floor as a crime scene, thanks to the police finding Spitz's body. Detective Turkovich (Robert Di Donato) questions Don because Spitz's body was found in pieces by a garbageman and the stitches on Spitz's chest are exactly the same as the ones that were found in Stan's body in the hospital. Don says he knows nothing about it and the detective leaves. Carter pays Don a visit thanks to a collaboration between Ava and Carter's prostitute girlfriend Rebecca (Tara Sukustis). Don wants to buy his contract and Don tells him to come back tomorrow (uh-oh!). Don makes love to the prostitute that Spitz abused, when he is visited by Ava. The prostitute leaves and Ana demands a script, but Don tells her it is still all in his head. Don wants Ava to just forget about him, but Ava has a way of speaking to Don to make him stay in the game. Don says that she has to come to his apartment tomorrow when Carter arrives (He says to Ava, ""I'll spin the web, but you're the black widow!""). When Ava leaves, Don is once again visited by Detective Turkovich, telling Don that there is video footage of Don and Stan entering the motel, but no footage of either one of them leaving. Don kills the detective in the bathroom with a claw hammer, scrubs the bathroom clean, fills a bunch of hypodermic needles with all types of deadly drugs, puts a gun under his chin and pulls the trigger, committing suicide (He leave a note saying he is sorry and wishes Ava luck). Ava kills Carter after seeing Don's body and reading the note. She stabs Carter with the hypodermic needles Don left on the bathroom sink until Carter's chest looks like a pin cushion. She laughs like a mad woman and then the film ends with her screaming over Don's death (which she was mostly responsible for and she realizes that there is no way she can get out of this).  More of a character study than a horror film or thriller, this movie makes Don a decent guy who is deeply depressed and he was just looking for revenge for his girlfriend's death and then other people (especially Ava) get involved and it spirals out of control. Don never wanted to be a mass murderer, but forces beyond his control made him one. The fact that Don pays Spitz's prostitute her $100 fee and then she joins him in bed a few days later proves that he is a decent guy at heart. But revenge only leads to more and more violence and Don learns it the hard way, but he gets his revenge by blowing his brains out, since his ""screenplay"" was all in his head. His suicide is a complete surprise to the viewer because it is shown so matter-of-factly, but when you think about it long after the film is over, you realize that it was the only choice that made sense. The acting is effectively sleazy across the board (Stephen Geoffreys pulls-back his normal over-acting here [unlike MR. HUSH] and comes off like a depressed man who is just trying to cope as things get worse and worse), but Corey Haim comes off the worst because of his ridiculous British accent (which he said was a tribute to Jason Statham!). While the blood and gore is kept to a minimum (I can't really speak if there is more gore in the original version, but it doesn't look like there was, since most of the carnage takes place in Don's bathroom), there is plenty of topless nudity (but none by Shepis, dammit!). The whole atmosphere of the film feels dirty and grimy (like a fleabag hotel should), which I think director/producer/writer BC Furtney (WEREWOLF RISING - 2014) was aiming for. Still, for a film of this type, a little more blood and guts wouldn't have hurt but, like I said in the beginning of this review, I'll watch anything with Tiffany Shepis in it and she shines here as an agent without a soul. Executive Producer Jesse Baget directed the horror film WRESTLEMANIAC (2006); was one of the directors on the anthology film ZOMBIEWORLD (2014); and wrote the story to MISCHIEF NIGHT (2013). Also starring Danielle Fortwangler, Sam Nicotero, Wayne Kryka, Brain Derby, Danny Cooper and a quick cameo from director BC Furtney as a bartender. An RLJ Entertainment DVD Release. Not Rated.",1386115200,,11795,4.3731207289293845
