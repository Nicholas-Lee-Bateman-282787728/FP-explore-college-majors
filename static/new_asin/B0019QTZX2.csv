Oh, ma-a-a-aaan, when this thing was released back in 1987, I woulda thought that these chicks were so hot...but now, er, hmmm...well, apart from Hope, the one in the lower righthand corner on the front cover (and maybe on the back, too?), they're all, um, a'ight, I guess..? Yeah, but Hope, mmmm, she is muy tasty, and she's the only one whose workout actually looks a real aerobic sweat-down. Another cool detail: the way that this is lit, you can see the fine, downy blonde hairs on their legs and arms, not all totally depilated, the way these kinds of women would be these days. Anyway, at the end of the tape they run through all the 'candidates' once more and the solicit you, the viewer, to mail in your vote for your pick for Miss Aerobics U.S.A. Competition. Unfortunately, the deadline was December 31st, 1987, so I missed my chance to vote (for Hope). The prize was a new VCR (!) and ""hundreds"" of Dusty Woods titles. (I didn't even realize that Dusty Woods had that many titles.) So, what I'd like to know is, which of these would-be aerobics queens actually won the contest, and what did she win? A new VCR, too?",1326931200,,1196,4.541666666666667
