2728296,2,B0009J2GYA,"I was looking for something more along the lines of  ""Cujo"" or ""Man's Best Friend"", but ended up with  a cross between "" Case 39"" and ""the Omen"".  The first time I saw this movie, I was in the hospital recovering from major surgery. Perhaps that's why I thought this movie would be a good idea.",1407628800,,294,4.214285714285714
2728297,5,B0009J2GYA,"I bought this movie thinking that it would be scary to watch.  It is not.  My brother and his wife came over to watch it with me, and we discovered that it is pure, hilarious schlock greatness.  In fact, it's apparently quite famous (there are special features and everything).  Excellent purchase; I am highly (hint, hint) satisfied.",1391385600,2,334,4.807017543859649
2728298,5,B0009J2GYA,"The best supernatural made-for-TV movie ever. A true pre-CGI classic! Better than most horror films at that time. If you collect horror movies, especially 1970-80s horror films,  think Hammer horror films, and you don't have this one, your collection is incomplete. Yes, it's that good.",1383264000,,286,5.355555555555555
2728299,4,B0009J2GYA,"its not the best bad dog movie ive seen, but with a good cast and story to it, this 70s tv movie is likeable and the bluray  has a very good look to it, also with lots of special features to on the disc, so its not a bad buy at the price,",1380153600,6,238,3.490566037735849
2728300,4,B0009J2GYA,"I was pleasantly surprised with Devil Dog. I didn't expect much going in, but the cast was very good. The movie is well made and the picture quality is superb. A possessed dog with mind control powers has a sinister effect on its family. The dad(Richard Crenna)is the only one not in on the little secret. There were some parts throughout that were rather comical. Some scenes were hard to believe, but they were entertaining none the less. The ending lacked thought and the story could have used some depth but Devil Dog is enjoyable and definitely worth a look.",1290902400,,563,4.64

8167987,4,B0009J2GYA,It's old but I swear it's one of the good bad dog movies available.,1461801600,,67,3.857142857142857
8167988,5,B0009J2GYA,"Devil Dog stars Richard Crenna (Rambo series) as a concerned father who notices something is not quite right with the new puppy German Shepard they have taken into their home after an apple cart salesman offers it to them after they lose their precious former dog by tragic and mysterious circumstances. Yvette Mimoux (The Black Hole) stars as Crenna's beautiful wife, who seems to be taken by this new guest of the home.
Things soon begin going from pleasant to horrifying as the story proceeds, and it's up to Crenna to find a remedy to this Devilish Hound from Hell before it consumes his entire family with its evil influences. Slow building horror and very satisfying for fans of 70's horror classics.",1461196800,2,706,4.795081967213115

8167991,3,B0009J2GYA,Good not great made for TV movie. Curtis Harrington directed movie just for the check and admits it in extra. Paid low so worth it to me I like Harrington and Crenna.,1447113600,,166,4.21875
8167992,2,B0009J2GYA,"This movie has outdated special effects. The plot is good. However, this horror flick lacked suspense, mystery, and the ending wasn't thrilling. I would recommend watching this film before going to bed, when you are completely tired.",1431043200,,233,5.324324324324325
