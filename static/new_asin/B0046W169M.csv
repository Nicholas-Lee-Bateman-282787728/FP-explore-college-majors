8586896,5,B0046W169M,"I've been rapping since 1987, and I am big Twista fan since Runnin' Off At The Mouth.  I always wondered how did he spit so fast, how do he breathe; till I learned from my homie who can also spit rapid fire lyrics.  So as I learned, I became quicker than my boy which helped me understand how Twista does it. Now people label me as the ""Twista of BHam"", AL...Thank you T for all of your great music and you'll always have my support homie...Chi-Town love.",1312761600,,455,4.218390804597701
8586897,4,B0046W169M,"Love Documentaries. This was especially great to see. I have not seen such a real and raw documentary go into so much detail. Didn't know about all that violence in Chicago. And Twista is an amazing artist!

Must have for music fans..",1292803200,,234,4.571428571428571
8586898,5,B0046W169M,"I got a chance to attend a private screening of the film in Chicago. All I can say is, WOW! I didn't know much about Twista and the violence in Chicago. This is truly one of the most entertaining music films of our generation. Twista is a living hip hop legend and we get to see unbelievable footage of him from his past and a current look at the making of a great album.

So much people do not know about the city of Chicago and its struggles with gun violence. And this raises the bar for music films inspired by one of the greatest cities in our nation.",1290038400,,556,4.10091743119266
