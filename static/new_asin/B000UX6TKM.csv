2926015,1,B000UX6TKM,"just a heads-up to those of you who care, or are just tuning in...
season two edited out the original music in favor of an inept clipart soundtrack. rock around the clock was also replaced during the opening credits. the video quality of season two was inconsistent...very poor in some scenes, and okay in others. if you are looking for the real stuff, my advice to you would be to wait until this thing is reviewed thoroughly before deciding to venture any hard-earned cash on it.  i loved happy days as a kid, but season two was so disappointing that i traded it in for store credit toward something else. ***PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT MY MISTAKE. I WISH I HAD WAITED BEFORE BUYING SEASON TWO.***",1187740800,22,692,4.536

2926019,2,B000UX6TKM,"This is the last good season of Happy Days, but just barely, as Henry Winkler now a main top-billed character--  an obnoxious, arrogant, and self absorbed lead rather than his earlier quiet, subtle, mysterious, silent, more likeable cool. But ""complete"" seasons are to be just that.. absolutely ""complete!"" and these are not, for whatever reason. We can watch chopped and edited version on TV reruns, but we shouldn't expect them from the DVD sets. As one reviewer already mentioned, Fonzie's ""limbo"" at the finale of ""the ""Fonzie's New Friend"" episode is completely disregarded and this was one of the highlights of the episode. Personally, Happy Days could have been a great, tribute to nostalgia show, if not for the producers and writers' left-wing agenda and hatred for 1950s America, but I'll save this rant for another time. Anyhow, save your money, and head to your local library instead.",1481155200,2,896,5.054054054054054

2926024,4,B000UX6TKM,"The relationship/chemistry between Ron Howard's Richie Cunningham and Henry Winkler's Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli is what powered this series for the first several seasons, and it's in fine form here.  The first episode of the season sees Fonzie moving into the Cunninghams' attic, over Richie's Father Howard's objections, initiating what I thought were the series' best episodes--the more time Fonzie and Richie spent around each other, the stronger the episodes were.  Other favorites of mine during this season were ""The Motorcycle"" (Richie and his friend Potsie--they never did explain how he got that nickname--conspire to keep Fonzie from finding out that Richie's other friend Ralph Malph has crashed into Fonzie's motorcycle), ""They Call it Potsie Love"" (a really sweet episode in which Richie's little sister Joanie falls for Potsie after he practices a song by serenading her, then secretly sends him love letters addressing him as ""Dren"" [""nerd"" backwards, because she believes he's the total opposite of a nerd]; Potsie is excited about having a secret admirer, until she arranges for a meeting and he realizes Joanie is the one with a serious crush on him), ""Richie Fights Back"" (one of a number of early episodes in which Fonzie coaches Richie on how to deal with gang-member bullies by looking and acting tough), ""Dance Contest"" (After being teased by her family about wanting to enter a TY dance contest, Richie's mother Marion goes behind their backs to take dance lessons from Fonzie; Howard and the others try to figure out where she's going all the time and decide she must be having an affair, and Fonzie almost gets gang-banged by the lot of them before he and Marion can participate in the contest), and too many others to list here.

The series was really starting to hit its stride with this season, and I am anxious to complete my season collections--up TO the season where they separated Fonzie and Richie and started messing with the characters, which I think is around season 6 or 7.",1469318400,2,2012,5.017964071856287

2926092,5,B000UX6TKM,"I liked the first two seasons as good nostalgic fun but this season, where Fonzie moves in, is where the show really hit a level it would never know again. It is a hilarious show with all the actors giving energy and originality to the stories. Henry Winkler really does steal the show. Sure, by today's standards, he is kinda boorish, but it's great fun to see him flex his muscles as Fonz. And this was before the show started getting really silly.
The following seasons were progressively worse but still not awful. The problem is they all became caricatures of themselves. In every episode Ralph would say 'I still got it' after saying a bad joke. Potsie would sing. Richie would make that laugh or sing 'Ive found my thrill'. And then, of course, there is Fonzie, who suffered most of all from so much success.
But if you want to see when Happy Days was at its freshest and funniest, watch this season.",1403827200,2,907,4.503030303030303

2926105,4,B000UX6TKM,"This is the 3rd season, the one season when I became a fan of the show. I remember begging my mother to buy me a Fonzie T-shirt at the local store! Here, you have Fonzie (Henry Winkler) co-starring with Richie (Ron Howard), along with their buddies Ralph Malph (Donnie Most) and Potsie (Anson Williams) and sister Joanie (Erin Moran), mother Marion (Marion Ross) and father Howard (the late Tom Bosley). I had to dock it one star because the endings of Fonzie's New Friend and A Date With Fonzie are missing (I hope if this is ever released on Blu-Ray, the omission will be rectified, that and re-storing the music in Season 2 to its original). Also, the popular song ""Happy Days"" makes its debut at the opening (though it was used as background music and the ending theme as early as Season 1. Fonzie debuts his catchphrase ""Aaaaay!,"" Ralph debuts his catchphrase ""I still got it,"" Potsie is known as much by his singing abilities as his occasional dopey actions (""You're such a Potsie, Potsie!"") and Richie debuts his theme song ""I found my thri-i-ill on blueberry hi-i-ill!"" and his sarcastic ""Huh! Huh! Huh!"" laugh.

In the opening episode, Fonzie Moves In, Fonzie rents out the room in the Cunninghams' garage and becomes a part of the family (though Howard naturally has his reservations). In Two Angry Men, Fonzie builds a roost for his pigeons on the roof and the roof caves, leaving Fonzie to sue Mr. Cunningham and Howard counter-sues (June Lockhart plays the judge). A Date With Fonzie marks the debut of characters Laverne (Penny Marshall) and Shirley (Cindy Williams), who would earn their own show later that season in 1976 (""'Laverne, you have a mouth like a sewer', I said. So she curls up her chubby little fist and BAM!"" knocking down Richie who's just brought in refreshments). Bringing Up Spike features Fonzie's carbon copy nephew Spike (Danny Butch), who would later disappear without any references (""So Chachi, how's my other nephew Spike doing? He's got a homecoming date? Whoa!""). Fonz realizes the need to be a father figure after Spike is the accessory of a crime. Potsie plays Richie in The Other Richie Cunningham, when Howard forces Richard to take out a client's daughter, though Richie already has a date (and Potsie's not much a gentleman and gets the real Richie in trouble!). Richie tries to stand up to 2 bullies in Richie Fights Back (""Don't ever grab me again!""). In The Motorcycle, Ralph accidentally totals Fonzie's bike and must face the wrath of the Fonz! Fearless Fonzarelli features (as well as Pat Morita's debut as the lovable Arnold) the Fonz riding his motorcycle over a series of garbage cans (a 2-part episode, the ending of the 1st part features the Fonz getting ready to jump (not the shark- yet!). Fonzie's New Friend features an African American named Sticks (John Anthony-Bailey) and the town just isn't ready for him. Arnold's Wedding features Arnold getting married to a young Asian lady who gets cold feet (and Fonzie has cold feet about being the best man). Joanie develops a crush on Potsie after he croons ""Put Your Head On My Shoulder"" to her (""Things'll be different when I'm 22 and you're 19,"" Potsie politely tells Joanie). Howard's 45th Fiasco shows a self-conscious Howard fearing getting old. In Tell It To The Marine, Ralph gets turned down and considers enlisting in the Marines (with the Fonz's encouragement) and it's up to the Fonz to talk him out of it (""I admit I was r-r-r-r...""- the opposite of right, a word the Fonz has trouble saying). In Jailhouse Rock, Officer Kirk (Ed Peck) lays down the new curfew and when Richie and his friends are locked inside Arnold's past 10pm, he arrests them all on the spot (along with Howard for wearing a silly Leopard skin cap). But in Fonzie The Flatfoot, Kirk pardons Howard's numerous parking tickets and approves a parking area on the condition the Fonz serve duty to break up a rumble (Richie does a brief imitation of the Fonz, much to Fonzie's chagrin). In A Sight For Sore Eyes, Fonzie learns he needs glasses (and Potsie is nominated for King Fool and Richie, while away in Chicago, meets a nice Texan belle, also Jack Dodson plays Ralph's father, who's an optometrist). Fonzie tries getting a new job after his job as a mechanic requires a crewcut from his new boss (Dick Van Patten makes a guest appearance). In Three On A Porch, Richie, Potsie and Ralph pretend they're older so they can reserve a place at Uncle Tom's Cabin for Spring break (Richie's ""older"" voice is a scream, as are the accents of the 3 ""Tunisians"" who try to impress 3 beautiful women they share the porch with). Marion enters a dance contest and Arthur (the Fonz, of course) willingly agrees to be her partner, leading to rumors, speculations and a swift boot from ""Shortcake"" Joanie!. Richie and his friends (and little Spike) try to get tickets they cannot afford to a football game, so they wind up babysitting a few kids at the Cunningham house in order to raise money. Fonzie attempts to sing in Fonzie The Superstar (he narrates rather than sings ""Heartbreak Hotel""). In one of my favorite episodes, Beauty Contest, Richie, Potsie and Ralph host a faux beauty contest promising prizes they cannot afford to give, just so they can meet women! Potsie serenades the not-so-lucky ""winner"" with ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World."" Finally, at The Second Anniversary Show, the gang hosts a surprise birthday party for the Fonz where they reminisce about past episodes.

So there you have it- one of the 1st seasons to make it big- aaayyyyy!",1341187200,4,5543,4.76690946930281
2926106,5,B000UX6TKM,"Although Happy Days was an outstanding series full of laughs and great writing, one wonders if this was an attempt at revisionism of the 1950's, a time of immense racism in the United States.  I applaud the show in the episode where the Fonz has a black friend.  However, the title of the show, Happy Days, and the fact that all the main cast are white, one wonders having come out the turbulent 1960's; Martin Luther King; and the Civil Rights legislation that passed, whether this show was appropriate for American Television. Al, the Asian owner of the restaurant, was the only exception to being white.  However, he left the show.  Why were the 1950's happy?  Was this because segregation was the law of the land? If the show concerned American prosperity, there was poverty during that time period.  Everyone did not live a middle class life in a white neighborhood.  I am not sure that the series ever adequately addressed these questions.  Whether intentional or not, I believe there was some sort of revisionism of the 1950's.",1313884800,,1034,4.769662921348314

2926108,1,B000UX6TKM,"This is the season that ended Happy Days. It became a silly fantasy show that had nothing to do with the 50's, it was boring and ridiculous. ABC and the producers aren't to blame, though, the audience wanted a cartoon version of the 50's and didn't want a show about about a 50's family. Ron Howard commented ""I was bored by what happened by the 3rd season and wanted out of it"". Who can blame him? A once precious TV show was now a silly clown act, aimed towards juveniles and people whose minds are bland and are entertained by constant childish nonsense. The 50's were not like this, later, Ron Howard would say he regretted every season after season two.

He said he was embarrassed to have been a part of the show. Hey, Ron Howard, we understand. The 3rd season plots were idiotic and predictable, Saturday morning cartoons were far more intelligent.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.",1252800000,8,892,4.506172839506172
2926109,5,B000UX6TKM,"Don't you love this phrase?

This is the best set of Happy Days released on DVD yet.  While I haven't reviewed season 4 yet, I think this is much better than Season 2 and even Season 1 on DVD.  Filming is excellently transferred to DVD, very vivid colors and great film transfer.

The shows are supper funny.  Very good writing.  The characters are all fully developed by now, and it's fun to see early appearances from currently well known actors like Jeff Conaway (Ritchie Fights Back), and others.  Ritchie's sister seemed like such a baby in the first two season, but she seems like a full-fledged teen in this season; makes me wonder if they ""babied"" up her appearance in the first two seasons.  She's very funny in this season, and not such a ""little girl"" annoying anymore.

Where's Ritchie's older brother?  Killed in a war?  Off to the NBA?  Funmny, I know this disappearance is well discussed on all the message boards, but you gotta admit, it's probably more discerned, but less noticed than even the ""jumping the shark"" bit by Fonzie in a later season.

I highly recommend this season for purchase, or even rental.  My wife bought it for me, for Christmas, and I'm well into the 2nd disc.  The 4 disc set includes a very nifty space saving 1 plastic case holder, and the discs all fit nicely into the packaging. The descriptions are on the inside cover of the artwork and it makes a very nice and space saving package.  Very sweet deal!

2926112,4,B000UX6TKM,"So far so good.. All episodes watched so far on the first two discs have nice crisp sound & picture quality, compared to the unreliable quality on seasons 1 & 2. Can't comment on episode editing...my memory's not that good & never taped the show, so will have to rely on others for this information.

Next, IMHO this season surpasses one and two, for the most part, due to its sharper writing, and more energetic playing thanks to the studio audience & influence of Jerry Paris in the director's seat (for all but 4 episodes).
Henry Winkler, as The Fonz, breaks out as the lead character in this season, without destroying the fabric of the ensemble: the 'boys' (Richie, Potsie & Ralph) & the Cunninghams.

Unfortunately, the 50's atmosphere has diminished due to restricting most of the action indoors (Arnolds mostly), with few outdoor scenes, to accommodate the studio audience. At least this season still finds the characters, ""in character"" circa 1950's, without the ugly 70's look and lingo which took over during seasons 4-5.",1221004800,2,1032,4.8914285714285715

the fans that know the episodes  well notice a scene edited here or there and certain music couldn't be used because of the expense to paramount but now that currently 45 bucks buys all 3 new with free shipping i would recommend these. I know dvd sets can be made much nicer with better packaging and extras like bloopers , commentery & interviews and its good to know ahead to expect all your gonna get are the episodes but they are clean, great quality , and have nice menus, also just the fact that you get the full picture without all the logos and junk you get if you record the shows off tv. I would hope they get season 4  released soon and I want to add now in recent years nick at nite has self destructed & tv land has ventured into reality tv giving replacement to the great classics like happy days and well on its way to becoming another channal to flip past making the great tv series dvds  more important now than ever before. I recommend these dvd's even with the negatives that are true but holding out for better dvds aint an option. life is short paramount...get em released !",1212278400,7,1371,4.368627450980392
2926118,3,B000UX6TKM,"The first three seasons of ""Happy Days"" need little introduction to fans of classic TV.  The writing and acting was stellar- although the biggest change- and not necessarily for the better- was switching to filming the show in front of a live audience in this year.
The product itself is unfortunately abysmal. It's hard to image it being any worse. The care these shows are given is reminiscent of the hapless approach RCA Records took to marketing Elvis Presley's catalog in his final years. While the music ""edits"" aren't as obvious as in season 2, the transfer to DVD- particularly on the set-ending ""Anniversary Special"" is actually blurry and difficult to watch. A home-recorded VHS to DVD transfer couldn't have looked any worse! The lack of any special features, notes, or care in the preparation of this set is sad. I bought my copy on the marketplace and couldn't recommend paying full-price for such a poorly crafted treatment of this great American sitcom.",1211241600,2,968,4.938650306748467

After ruining season 2, Paramount has put together another low quailty DVD set and to make matters worse, some episodes are edited and missing their classic tag scenes! This is an insult to fans and to this show. Whats next?... editing out Howard Cunningham offering Richie a 'Lifesaver'? or Leather Tuscadero's (Suzie Quatro) songs?! Although this show went way down hill in the later years, at this time is was still fairly entertaining even if not nearly as good as the first two seasons. There are a few bright spots in this season, but the series was never the same after they went to a live audience and ""The Fonz"" became the focus of the show. Like season 2, I will skip buying this garbage because of lack of care. Too bad for fans :-(.........",1210032000,15,820,4.585034013605442

2926121,3,B000UX6TKM,"This, in my opinion, is the best season of Happy Days.  The writing was outstanding and Henry Winkler was at his peak.  THIS is the season that should have ranked as the #1 show on television (it finished at #11, season four is the one that reached the top).  There is one problem with the DVD though.  Certain episodes (very few...I think) are edited.  One of my all-time favorite scenes is missing.  It is the end tag of the episode titled ""Fonzie's New Friend"".  This is where Fonzie does the limbo.  But it's gone....why?  I also noticed a couple of edits here and there on one or two other episodes.  The sad thing is that this is probably the only form these episodes will ever be released in.  Yet, we won't ever be able to see certain parts of some episodes.  Sad.
On a lighter note, I recently had the opportunity to see the Happy Days house when I was in Hollywood.  Of course this was just used for the exterior shots, but it hasn't changed much.  If you're ever out there and you're interested in seeing it, it's easy to find.  I can't give you the house address here (especially since people actually live there) but it's easy to research on the internet.",1202774400,34,1168,4.392523364485982

I particularly remember being very excited for the third season to begin in 1975 after Season Two had one live episode during which the audience absolutely howled with laughter.  This is the best season - and a few years before it ""jumped the shark.""  My only complaints are that many episodes were quite dark, although turning up the brightness on my television helped.  The other complaint was in the episode with Laverne and Shirley - some business before Richie came in the window was deleted and the last episode (the tag) was not included.  This is really unacceptable.  Otherwise, buy it and enjoy it.",1202428800,2,735,4.6953125

The episodes are as good as I remmember them even though music has obviously been changed, you get a lot of the same version of ""Wake up little Susie"" with some characters even dancing to what seems an altogether different song, anyway, no good complaining about something I had learned beforehand, what did bother me was the ultra-cheesy presentation which very much differs from the first season and earlier Paramount releases. I can't imagine how much money they can possibly be saving to feel like it's worth doing it.
At any rate, season 3 of Happy Days is my favorite and even though I'm happy with my purchase the lack of a quality presentation will make it my first and only one of this show.",1202169600,6,744,4.559701492537314
2926124,5,B000UX6TKM,"I am one of Happy Days biggest fans! When I was younger my whole family would come together to watch the show. Now thanks to dvd, I can share that with my girls.

I know one may take issue with the case, But as  a frequent movie/dvd purchaser I can tell you this case that they have been selling them in for the past 2 seasons (season 1 had a different packaging style) isn't the worst.  In fact its nice I don't see it as flimsy at all. Its nice that it doesn't take up alot of space (I have aprox. 400+ titles in my dvd collection)

One issue I have is with CBS/Paramount in that they haven't annonced when Season 4 is coming out, They have already set a date for Laverne & Shirley season 4, but no news on Happy Days. They have been releasing them on the same day. I would be extremely angry if they didn't release the rest of the seasons remaining in the show. How dumb would that be if they didn't complete the show like they completed The Andy Griffith Show?

The complete series set of TAGS, is by far the worst way to package a dvd tv set. When I got mine (Had to order it online) the set came damaged with two big dents in it, as well as it had been busted open and several of the dvds were loose in the package.

I hope that they announce season 4's release date soon!",1200873600,,1278,4.031620553359684

The live audience provided tremendous energy into these episodes and therefore make them better for me than the previous two (though I still love the first two seasons).

Winkler, Howard, Most, Williams, Bosley, Moran, Morita, Ross all provide a tremendous ensemble and I believe (and my children 10, 7 and 3 agree) that there is something very special about this season and the first half of the fourth that make these very special Happy Days.  These days are ours indeed.",1200096000,,582,4.732673267326732
2926126,5,B000UX6TKM,"Okay, we still contend with amazingly flimsy DVD cases (as if the technology just came out!). But the 24 episode 1975-1976 season is the closest I've gotten to once again seeing a cherished series in its full glory, including yes, the original music performances by Anson Williams himself.

Continuing with the `consciousness raising' he himself had began last season with an intended marriage; Fonzie voluntarily agrees to enter a dance contest with Marion (""Dance Contest""). The multiple references to Marion being bored and then having an affair to break up the routine of her daily life allude to the 1970's displaced homemaker's movement. We do not know if she has picked up and flipped through Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" or other books. But we do know that things are not as ideal as were mythologized in more traditional 1950's sitcoms!

Fonzie himself assumes a prominent role during this season---moving into the apartment right above the Cunningham garage to maximize screen time to the greatest extent possible. The original plan was to have his Grandmother Nussbaum take the room, initially so the Cunninghams would compensate for lost revenue against a newly opened local outpost of a national mega-chain (""Fonzie Moves In""). It was threatening the viability of Cunningham Hardware.

But she could not make the move and ethics problems prevented the mega chain from expanding in Wisconsin. So the accommodation was for him to become their apartment tenant. Their impromptu arrangement also makes it convenient for the Fonz to now appear at the Cunningham household to quickly dispense advice--or save the day. Fonzie quickly went from a bit part to attracting near thunderous cheers from the now live audience.  Richie was excited about getting essentially a new big brother. Chuck is gone, never to be referenced again!

But Howard was anxious about the arrangement. He realized that Fonize's moving in required some adjustment on everybody's part during this first year--including Fonzie.  This Howard Cunningham is one of the knowledgeable fathers who you could feel good about turning to in a crisis.  He's obviously not a fuddy-duddy himself either.

The person who is a fuddy-duddy is Officer Kirk (deliciously played by Ed Peck), making his first appearance in ""Jailhouse Rock"". Milwaukee is a big city, even by 1950's population standards. But for some reason, this police officer takes it upon himself to be the sole arbiter of morality. Out of everything which could and probally did happen, he was actually most threatened by teens being out after dark, so a curfew was enacted against them.  Inadvertently getting tangled up in Kirk's world view of `law and order' Howard finally concedes that being the grand poobah of a lodge in a fascist society would not be worth anything.

Adding some drama to the television sitcom, Fonzie becomes an informant for Officer Kirk of all people! This and Henry Winkler lifting weights are the interesting parts of the episode. Contemporary police dramas and their watchers know that informants do not go back to their former group publically dressed out in police uniform--they instantly stick out like a sore thumb and the cover is blown! Still, I suppose it was the thought that mattered with this particular episode. The writers wanted to show that Fonzie had dramatic tension despite now being good. Hanging out with clean cut guys is not at all the same as always having been one.

He makes another valiant attempt when Herb sells the auto shop (""Fonzie the Salesman""). Since this career has essentially now been killed courtesy of the Internet, it definitely dates the series. In addition to being an anal retentive neat nick who apparently does not get the concept of `grease monkey', the new owner wants the Fonz to gasp--get a crew cut! He is moderately successful selling books door-to-door, meeting lonely women, but truthfully needs to work on cars. The episode is finally interesting because it's one of the few times in this series where the Fonz's hair is yes, uncombed!

And then people who Richie believed were `hip', decide to boycott a party just because there is an African American band player (""Fonzie's New Friend""). Apparently in Wisconsin, the mere mixing of races was considered that controversial in the 1950's. Again, retrospect provides subtle---but powerful sociopolitical critique in a supposedly apolitical sitcom about a theoretically innocent era.  Fonzie is a very well connected guy for the era; not only is he friends with different races, but he is then able to hook Sticks up with an African American woman, also suggesting that he knew women of other races.

But with this new idolization also comes new responsibility (""Tell it to the Marines""). Fonzie learns that the comments which he makes now get taken very seriously by the people around him.  After a girl breaks up with him, a despondent Ralph decides to join the military, after Fonz unwittingly talked him into it. Living with people and being part of a crowd has a cost! While it's possible that the military would provide a growth experience for Ralph, going through life not accountable for the power which his words had over other people would also have made the Fonz (and his real life counterpart) the worst kind of role model imaginable. An ego-manaic celebrity!

And then ""Bringing Up Spike"" confirms he can't pawn off HIS responsibilities on other people even when he is frustrated and does not know what to immediately do. This season is good yes, because it shows Fonzie as flawed and immediately relatable to audiences. He is not a superhero who just happens to wear a leather jacket.

One of the clumsy examples of working in 70's inferences was ""Richie Fights Back"". Attempting to initially address the off-screen phenomena's both of Fonzie-mania and Asian American awareness, it did not adequately explain the latter. It would have perhaps been more in line with the times to explain why `Matsuo Takahashi' had really Americanized his name to 'Arnold' during that era. Sure, the kids accept him as long as he keeps serving up their food, but what additional barriers was he facing?

The second anniversary show is included and I guess this is technically an extra, as it was with the series. The filming of this season looks to be carried out in good quality. The accurate title credits are used and the original music is included. Some people claim that portions of episodes were removed, but I honestly cannot tell the difference.  I really want there to be a fourth season.",1199923200,12,6566,5.02391904323827
2926127,4,B000UX6TKM,"I have just finished watching this box set that I got for Christmas...its good and it brings back a lot of fond memories. But I am upset over the content, by that I mean CBS/Paramout cut the episodes or these are the Syndicated episodes. And I am Upset.

For example, in the episode where they bring in Laverne and Shirley, at the end of the episode when the family gets back from Aunt Bessie's Hospital room and after all of the smoke clears, Howard, Richie and Fonzie are in the living room and Howard asks Richie what happened there tonight and Richie explains the truth, then Howard turns to Fonzie and asks him what happened. Fonzie proceded to give him a wild story about richie sowing his wild oats and then Howard pauses and turns to Richie and puts his arm around Fonzie and says thats what I wanted to hear ..the ""truth"" That whole scene was cut out and it bothers me. The only reason I rememberd all of that is because I have it on VHS tape from years back.

I just cant see Garry Marshall Sitting back and letting Paramount do this to his wonderful creation, I mean if people complained about Roseanne and they went back to the masters and released the FULL versions instead of the syndicated versions, why cant the do this For a Much better Show Called Happy Days?
Its a good buy but i am upset about the chopping of episodes, you pay for the full episodes not this chopped up crap. Come on CBS/Paramount step up to the plate and do the right thing release the full episodes!!",1199664000,5,1489,4.371841155234657

Memorable episodes include ""Dance Contest,"" where Marion decides to enter, and the two-part ""Fearless Fonzarelli,"" where the Fonz is injured attempting a motorcycle stunt.

Also, Laverne and Shirley make an appearance, before going into their own spin-off (also having released Season 3 at the same time as Happy Days). I always enjoy having cross-overs of the characters, even if the roles are minimal; it just feels like getting an additional treat.

The one negative thing about this box set is that, like ""Laverne and Shirley,"" there are no extras! Like many fans, i would greatly enjoy some bloopers or interviews with the actors...yet none are included in any of the ""Happy Days"" sets to date.",1197244800,,930,5.105263157894737

2926141,5,B000UX6TKM,"I appreciate those who hold the first two seasons with such high reverence at the expense of the live audience seasons, but I'm not sure it's terribly deserved. Objectivity is difficult, but I (and some other viewers who have posted, as well) found Season 2 to be relatively not-so-well-written, and, worse, boring and dry at many turns. Sure, it was shot film style ... and, yes, ""every episode is like a little movie,"" etc. ...

But, Season 3 leaps off the page. The energy is so palpable you become a part of it. And, I think Season 3 is the raciest and sexiest of all the seasons (sometimes downright - and very UN-Happy Days-esque, naughty). It is truly the peak of Fonzie mania, and it captures the Winkler/Howard/Williams/Most fab four at their rawest. Tom Bosley's character has an edge (and layers) in this season that the writers never really gave him again. After watching Season 2, pop in Season 3 and I defy you to miss it: it's live, it's raw, it's exciting ... and funny as all hell. Probably the most laugh-out-loud season of all eleven. Purists may be purists, but I truly believe if Happy Days had stuck to the first formula (one-camera with canned laughter), it wouldn't have seen a fourth season. Happy Days was quite Darwinian. It morphed into a variety of shapes to survive 11 seasons. Like some, I love them all, and all for different reasons. Garry Marshall said, ""I just wanted to create a group of people that you'd want to welcome into your home every week."" He sure did. These kinds of heartwarming shows just don't exist anymore.

Of the episodes I've watched as of this writing, I have detected no glaring music edits - at least none that are noticeably taking away from the series - however there are some scenes where the video is grainy and looking aged.
The only real flaw I have with this set is that, much like Season 2, the episode recaps are printed on the inside of the case and you have to remove DVDs from the case to read them. Couldn't the episode listings have been printed on a separate piece of paper or in a way where you don't have to remove DVDs to read them? Not a big issue, but I do find it annoying.

For the record the show hits #1 at a price.  The previous two seasons had a presentation like a movie on the small screen.  Beginning in season #3 Happy Days starts to portray itself like a high level stand-up comedy act with perfect timing.  The decision to primarily film in front of a live studio audience was a bad one.  Most of the funny outdoor scenes like the midnight drag race and Marsha knocking off the female mannequin are history.  Paramount also should have held back the release of the spin-off Laverne & Shirley on DVD.  We get their introduction.  The problem is Happy Days came out in 1974 and Laverne & Shirley in 1976.  The order is messed up on DVD.  Besides the debut of Pat Morita, my favorite episodes in seasons #3 are ""Fonzie Moving In"" and ""Fearless Fonzarelli"".
