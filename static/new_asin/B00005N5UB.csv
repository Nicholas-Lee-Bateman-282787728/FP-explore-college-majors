7946259,5,B00005N5UB,"I am very glad to see that Pamplin has re-released these video's.  My son played Mickey Masters.  Brian is getting a theatre degree, at Pepperdine University. I never tire of watching these films and I thank God that Brian was given the chance to work with such fine christians as Willie Ames and Grant Goodeve.  I can only hope that he will be as fine an actor as these two men.  I hope you all enjoy these film as as much as I do!  God Bless you all.",1030233600,,452,4.090909090909091
7946260,4,B00005N5UB,"This vidio, produced by the same people who did ""Bibleman""  is among the best I've ever seen.
When Mickey and Grant get assigned to make a daring rescue, there attempts to find someone who will help them result in a close brush with death that makes Mickey question wether God wants him to even be an Agent of Truth.  (...)
Asside from the fact that it's rather predictable in some points, it's and exclent movie.  Some things can easly be predicted if you're at all fimmiler with spy movies.  Needless to say, it's high-action, but it's the kind of action you can just kick back and watch while eating popcorn fresh from the micorwave.
Mickey Masters is a quite typical young teenager, and he has a typical kid life.",1007683200,,717,4.534883720930233
