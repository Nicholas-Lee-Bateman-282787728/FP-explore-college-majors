2381559,5,B000A8OJOK,"Since there are a limited amount of reviews for this movie series, i'll give a quick synopsis for the first film:

Back in the late 1930's puppet-maker Andre Toulon (played by William Hickey) found the secret of life and has instilled it into his creations - various puppets with uncanny abilities to kill.  Nazis are out to find out his secret but they are unable to (sorry, don't want to spoil it), and then the movie flash forwards to present day 1989.  A group of psychics attempt to figure out Toulon's secret by staying at the hotel he was at in the past, but come to find themselves stalked by the puppets that he created!

A great and wonderful movie if you like this kind of thing.  If you like movies like Dolls, Evil Dead 2, Night of the Demons, and Tales From the Darkside episodes, then chances are, you will love this film.  It would be wrong of me to bash this movie like other reviewers because I cannot hold it up to the same criteria as I would other movies.  It's just not fair.  These movies are for b-movie horror fanatics.  As a result of which, you likely enjoy a movie with a little extra cheese - and this one delivers!  It also has a fair amount of gore and gruesome deaths.  Often times, movies of this caliber pick up the pace as the series goes on, and i'd definitely say that the series gets better.  Part 1 sets the groundwork, and as a result, you may have to be a little more patient with it.  To it's credit, the dolls come out in the beginning.  But there is a considerable amount of down time in between then and the time their killing spree begins again.  This is the story setting itself up and I, at least, feel that it's worth it to get to the point of the story's cooler parts.

The dvd itself is from the now defunct Full Moon pictures.  They did a great job on these dvds considering the fact that these are b-movies and often times all we get is the presentation, a menu, and a trailer (as was the case with Dolly Dearest).  With this dvd, you get a behind the scenes featurette (the same one found on the vhs), cast bios, trailer, and some Full Moon ads for other movies and Puppet Master Toy Products.  Although the latter is useless since the company isn't around anymore, it was fun for me to look at, if nothing else, to waste a little time.

It's a shame these dvds aren't in production anymore.  If you want one movie, you'll pretty much have to buy the whole set.  On here, the prices for these are outrageous.  As of present day, you can get the whole set on [...]  Nevermind the huge fees from sellers on here and ebay.  You can purchase it directly from the company for a far cheaper price.  The whole series is very fun to watch if you are a b-movie horror fan, and it's not fair that major studios haven't gotten their acts together and made this film series readily available.  The series itself has their own fans and could welcome newer fans if they were easier to find.

My final verdict:  If you like killer doll movies or cheesy horror flicks, then do whatever you can to view this set.  If you are unsure about spending an extraneous amount of money for something like this, then go down to your local mom-and-pop rental store and pick up a vhs copy of the first.  If you like it, chances are, you'll have fun with the rest of the series and can go from there to obtain the set for a reasonable price at fullmoondirect.com",1135900800,9,3386,4.2933753943217665
2381560,1,B000A8OJOK,"Unlike the infamous Chucky from Child's Play, none of these dollies here can fit the shoes of the feared antagonist who happens to be the protagonist that we rave about, oh what fame we weave. This showcase lacks good overall fear and do not need any sequel to prove that it was just a one hit wonder....this one did it on its own merits. Lack of any realism has failed to draw us into the world of puppets where the master is king. I mean the mouth doesn't even move so how can we, as viewers, expect the gibberish nonsense was even coming from those puppets or should i say muppets. Plus add in the amateurist editing and you have a recipe with doom written all over it.

I just wasn't scared but i wanted to be. I really do but i end up laughing most of the time at how stupid scene after scene of funny looking puppets trying to scare us...they are just too cute looking maybe. I mean was that kermit the flog i just saw?!? Chucky emits fear just by glancing it its hidious plastic facial expression without a single word or movement. Now that, ladies and gentleman, is how to scare the funny bones in all of us ...Go to a toy store and look at this doll up front and center...it would scare the daylights out of you by it's evil priecing eyes of hate. Don't get me wrong, i am not affiliated nor promoting Child's Play in any way shape or form...i just happen to know what could scare me which these baboon creators of Puppet Master has no clue whatsoever. I am just saying that Child's Play got it right the first time and continue with it sequels to keep our deepest fears from wondering....oh be still my achy breaky heart.

Like i said, i want to be scared but i ended up seeing a comedy movie which i wasn't in the mood for. The film makers must of place this under the wrong genre when it came out. They must have!!!

2381634,5,B000A8OJOK,"I only saw <PUPPET MASTER 1 > so far from this collection <PUPPET MASTER 1-9> but already loved it.
When I first bought the movie <TOURIST TRAP> from this company fullmoondirect, I instantly fell in love with the lable.
The movie <TOURIST TRAP> was a masterpiece film about life like dolls which was also made by the same director who made this film. The name is David Schmoeller. He is what I call an artist.
Now this one is also about puppet horror but more of an artsy one and I really loved it too.
It has some kind of depth inside the story just like his early movie <TOURIST TRAP>.
To be said, it is not all B movie like and makes you want to be a true fan of the director. I think that made this movie a long sequal which made it possible to reach it all the way to the part 9 !.

Telling the story is not that important.

The puppet with little head reminded me of the Tim Burton's film <BEETLEJUICE> the hell part, the slice part of the puppet little guy of course reminded me of Hitchcock or even Brian De Palma.
The fact that the creator at the beginning kills himself (anyway he dies so) that is similar to the movie <EDWARD SCISSORHANDS>.

The Point of View shot of the puppet was kind of unoriginal but fun to watch.
And then all the people who has supernatural power came to the funeral and meet the puppet end up dead, how they die was fun to watch.
Even though it was cliche, still they were fun. Killed by small puppet was cheezy but wickidly fun.

The puppet movements were made by stop motion animation and it was not that unnatutal. It was fun to watch.
The ceremoney to get rid of the spookiness was fun to watch as well and you will enjoy too.

As I told you, the filmmaker is not a guy who just makes films without any preparation and you will see what I mean.
This is not just another B movie and is a well made film.
If you liked this film, you should dig his other film <TOURIST TRAP> for sure. The latter is way better though.",1464566400,,1954,4.145118733509235
2381635,3,B000A8OJOK,"I recently bought a 12 movie (on 3 discs) Echo Bridge Puppet Master & Killjoy box set. It has the first 9 Puppet Master's and first 3 Killjoy's. I've reviewed those three Killjoy movies already that came in a box set with the 3 Scarecrow movies so I've been slowly but surely working my way through the PM movies.

 Firstly I loved the first two Puppet Master movies when I was younger and I still think they hold up pretty well. They're just simply good fun. I hadn't seen PM 3 before but thought it was quite good the whole nazi angle.

 However PM 4 and PM 5 were atrocious. Elements of PM 5 were okay but the whole evil spirit muscle bound rubber suit creature idea was horrible. It was quite obvious to see PM 4 & 5 were filmed at the same time as they're essentially parts 1 & 2 of the same movie.

I've since watched Curse of the Puppet Master (part 6) and Retro Puppet Master (part 7). 'Curse' surprisingly wasn't that bad at all and the plot was half decent with Dr Magrew trying to turn humans into puppets. 'Retro' was just boring & appalling in every way from the acting to the convoluted plot to the wooden puppets.

I finally finished the Puppet Master box set with the 8th and 9th movies (PM: The Legacy and PM: Axis of Evil respectively). PM8 was another appalling entry in the franchise with seemingly only about 15-20 minutes of actual new film and the vast majority of it being flashbacks like a greatest hits offering.

 At least with PM9 they did attempt to make a proper movie but the whole hiding out at a Japanese opera theatre and the very rubbish ninja puppet dragged things down but at least it wasn't as insulting as part 8.

 Really only the first three are worth bothering with.",1463702400,2,1708,4.3427672955974845

2381851,4,B000A8OJOK,"The ""Puppet Master"" series is somewhat of a benchmark in direct-to-video horror. On a good day, the murderous little guys are listed among horror staples like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Child-s-Play/dp/B0000AOX0H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Child's Play</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser/dp/B001QMCJ0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser</a>&nbsp;movies, despite the fact that unlike Chucky and the Cenobites, they've never seen the inside of a movie theater. The automatic underdog status that the DTV label affords makes the long-running series a hero of the low-budget realm, and makes me more ready to accept the first movie's shortcomings and praise its successes. Though it scrabbles for this relatively high rating, it's too likeable to rate any lower.

The story: a group of psychics are mysteriously called by an old acquaintance (Jimmie Skaggs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutthroat-Island/dp/B00275EDYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutthroat Island</a>) to a seaside mansion. Upon finding their friend dead, the party will need to contend with the presence of five murderous little creatures out for their lives.

As a horror feature, the film throws a wide gambit: it's technically a slasher flick, but also features some attempts at psycho-thriller tactics, surreal horror (e.g. the ""heads"" dream), and some gross-out tactics (e.g. Leech Woman). It's modestly successful, if only for the probability that something the filmmakers threw at the wall *had* to stick, but I have to admit that the selling point of the movie - the puppets - aren't very scary. If that's what you're counting on, and don't happen to suffer from pupaphobia, then ""Puppet Master"" may disappoint you, although I personally enjoy these creatures from a technical and creative standpoint. Their stop-motion animation, courtesy of the great David Allen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batteries-Not-Included/dp/0783232047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">*Batteries Not Included</a>), is always fun to watch, and even the less convincing puppetry features occasional innovation, like having a real performer supply Pinhead's big hands.

The puppets are also, arguably, the most interesting characters of the flick, for better or for worse. Their nuanced personalities and clear hierarchical relationship was clear fodder for the sequels, whether or not these were already planned at the time of production. The human cast is less striking, for the most part. (SPOILER) Jimmie Skaggs is eye-catching as the maniacal villain, but he doesn't fully appear in this capacity until the last third of the movie. Until then, the film attempts to give equal screen time to all six people in the mansion, with the result that few of them are able to leave an impression...with the possible exception of the charismatic Irene Miracle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inferno/dp/6305807930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inferno</a>). The acting's roundly acceptable, though is less often highlighted by dramatic flair than by instances of ham (""I'm the master...and YOU'RE the puppet!"").

If you're not a fan of this film, it's reason enough to leave the rest of the series alone, but if you're intrigued, it's worthwhile to go forward. The fact that this first entry leaves a lot of the story's questions unanswered is only a drawback if you don't plan on watching the other movies, but personally, I recommend that you do.",1411862400,2,3626,6.348884381338743

2381880,2,B000A8OJOK,A Charles Band collection that includes the first 9 Puppet Master movies and the first 3 Killjoy movies. A true crapfest! Quantity. over quality. The really scary thing is that they made more of these movies.,1399075200,,208,4.805555555555555
2381881,4,B000A8OJOK,"i loved the puppet master series are great ive been a fan since the early days a must have collection,kill joy on the other hand i don't know what to say about this is kill joy was stupid! i don't recomend it!",1398988800,,209,4.0
2381882,5,B000A8OJOK,"This dvd set is well worth it for the puppet master films alone. They get crazier as the series goes on, incorporating nazis and monsters from other dimensions with each new installment. The series is low budget, violent fun. The Killjoy movies are kind of like a weird mix of It and Candyman but without the production value. I didn't find them very scary but they're very entertaining and fun to watch drunk with a few friends. I highly recommend this set to anybody who's looking for bargain B-movies.",1395878400,,504,4.674157303370786
2381883,3,B000A8OJOK,"The picture quality is at or lower that VHS, also in full screen format and files are all stuck at like 3-5 movies a disk.",1395446400,,122,3.92
2381884,5,B000A8OJOK,My daughter and I enjoyed the movies.  I never heard about Killjoy.  We sat up and watched it one night and cracked up laughing.,1394150400,4,128,4.291666666666667
2381885,5,B000A8OJOK,"I paid twice this locally and found that a bargain. has all 9 Puppetmasters. A couple of them are pretty bad and the sequencing of adding the puppets is confusing when watching them all but if you love these little guys, you will enjoy. The Killjoys are a killer clown series. Completely different clowns for each movie but all pretty good. These are not big studio productions. But if you are a fan of Full Moon movies, you won't be disappointed. As for quality, They put 5 puppetmasters on disk 1 (of 3) which I think was kinda stretching it - it got outta sync a couple of times on my new bluray player but the 2nd time I watched some, they behaved better so just keep this in mind if your player bogs easily. I found if you hit pause for a few seconds then play again, you can re-sync movies that this happens to. The other 2 disks contain 4 and 3 movies so they perform much better. No scene selections or anything fancy, just movies - but for  12!! excellent deal!",1391644800,,970,4.271739130434782

2381909,3,B000A8OJOK,This set contains nine Puppetmaster films and three Killjoy films (twelve-film set). Puppets come to life in Puppet Master which was a direct to video franchise (though Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys (2004 TV Movie) and Puppet Master X: Axis Rising (2012) are the exceptions). Killjoy is about an evil clown. While almost all of these films are now available on Blu-ray (there is a 3-film set and individual releases) you can't beat the price of this Complete Collection from Echo Bridge.,1377993600,,487,4.951219512195122

2381911,5,B000A8OJOK,I found one film from this series when I was a child and rented several after watching it. Lately I wanted to revisit the series and see the newer ones I had not already seen. Finding the whole collection plus 3 other films from the same company for such a low price was really cool. This series is not terrible and I believe is under rated compared to more mainstream films like the Chucky series. Interesting take on horror and puppets with a killer soundtrack. Definitely suggest for the money.,1375660800,6,497,4.533333333333333
2381912,4,B000A8OJOK,"i always wanted the old puppetmasters since a kid so i bought this collection and was a great deal....killjoy is kinda corny but funny not like the oldschool puppetmaster's tho, those are classics 1-3 puppets the best",1374624000,,217,4.891891891891892
2381913,5,B000A8OJOK,"I was missing one or two of the puppetmaster films here & there, so I thought I would get this. I'm glad I did, but the first 2 killjoy movies aren't that good. The puppetmaster movies are awesome though.",1374278400,,204,4.256410256410256

2381916,5,B000A8OJOK,"I read a couple other reviews that mentioned poor picture quality, so was pleasantly surprised when my copy arrived and I discovered it wasn't bad at all. Of course it's not blu-ray, but it's far from VHS quality. I'd say at $4.99 this collection is a SUPER deal! No special features are included, not even subtitles, but that's to be expected with a budget title.",1371340800,16,364,4.615384615384615
2381937,5,B000A8OJOK,Yes these movies are low budget and at times a bit cheesy but for under 10 bucks you can't complain you get 12 movies nd besides these films aren't bad to add to your horror collection,1370995200,,184,4.138888888888889
2381938,5,B000A8OJOK,i love these tpye of movies where the little guys win over the baddies i have seen one or two but the others w-e-l-l  i am glad that i have all the movies now the two i enjoyed the most were those of a young Toulon when he met his wife to be and how he changed after her demise i cant give t-o-o much away but if you are like me you will enjoy it i know i did  wayne shepherd,1370390400,,375,3.5609756097560976
2381939,5,B000A8OJOK,"Obviously, you can't expect any classics going in, but if you set the right tone you can have a great time with this set. Watching with your buddies, joking and screwing around on a couple late nights: these movies can pay for themselves several times over. Puppet Master is a name practically synonymous with empty-headed pulpy fun, and although some films are better than others (try the first three) they won't disappoint someone looking for a quick and fun distraction. Not as hot on Killjoy but the price is more than worth it for the Puppet Master movies alone, and you can't pass on a few extra free flicks. Bottom line? Great deal, fun decent movies, it's worth it for sure.",1369180800,2,682,4.644628099173554
2381940,4,B000A8OJOK,"12 films for $8.  How can you go wrong?  Most of these movies are pretty bad (but still pretty enjoyable) but you get so many in this collection, it's hard to say no.  Puppet Master series is about an old toymaker whose creations have come to life to kill people.  Killjoy is about a demon clown who comes to get revenge for whoever summoned him (just to give you an idea.)  Some of the films look pretty decent picture quality-wise, and some of them look really bad.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other in the case, which may lead to scratching the discs, so be careful with them.  I really wish that the films were 3 per disc and packaged differently.  The set would be much better if so, even if it was slightly more expensive (maybe $2 more)

Review is so short because there isn't much else to say about this collection.  Recommended, just make sure your expectations are in check.  None of these films are GREAT, some are a stretch to even call them good, but they are enjoyable for what they are, and that is cheesy horror fun.  If you care at all about picture quality, get one of the more expensive sets.  There are a few collections that run about $30 each, which isn't bad, and the quality is much better.  If you're a fan of this series, it may be worth considering.  However, if you're just looking for some cheesy movies to watch without much of a loss financially, this set will do you good.

2381946,5,B000A8OJOK,"As a personal fan of the series if you are just getting into the ""Puppet Master"" series of films there is a little word to the wise. Instead of continuing to think the story goes into the next movie try to think of each film as a new beginning with a new story with bites from the others since throughout the films some of the dates and stories do not match up this may confuse you a little so like I have said think of the next movie as a new beginning. Usually the first film is the best because they start the series but I think there are others better than the first one throughout the film including `Puppet Master: Axis of Evil' it is a newer one and honestly I would sort of start with that one first because the writer gave a more better look into how it all got started except the puppets look more fake than the other ones and are not exactly the same as the ones you fall in love with from the other movies. Each person has their own opinion so you have to mess around to see which order you would like them in and them when you do watch them over again.",1364169600,9,1065,4.028301886792453

2381963,5,B000A8OJOK,"OK Take this review in its frame of reference. Are these movies cinematic classics? No. Are these the best possible transfers of the films? No. Then why the high rating? If you know these films, you probably love them also. They're cheesy low budget films and there's something about getting 12 movies for $8 that adds to the experience of owning and watching these type of films. It just seems right. Like going to one of those 70's grindhouse theaters and watching 3 or more movies for .99.
Accept it in this spirit and enjoy.

the quality of the films isn't bad either.",1356307200,49,574,4.528846153846154
2381964,4,B000A8OJOK,this does not have puppetmaster vs. demonic toys.this is the first 9 puppet masters there are 10 puppet mastters. the killjoy collection is compleate but not the puppet master. this is like when they try to pass off the profacey & hellraiser collection as compleat when its missing the second profacy movie and hellraiser deader.they should stopp selling this as the compleat and in addition reissue it with the 10th one and have the option of buying them in widescreen or pan and scan. maybe they will release it as a true compleat collection in blu ray with or without killjoy. it was a nice idea but poorly executed. if you didn'tlike the last puppetmaster and the mix of widescreen and full screen doesn't bother you then buy this.if you go to fullmoon direct maybe you can send them the message to release their own compleat collection that would probably sell more than this release. the price is right for the boxset if it was the true compleate set.,1355875200,2,957,4.668639053254438
2381965,5,B000A8OJOK,I was able to get this at Best Buy on 10/2/12!!! Not sure about Amazons release date in November. This is an amazing value and is some of my favorite movies.  Echo Bridge has done an amazing job on these sets. I almost could not believe my eyes when I saw this!!!! Hope we see some more awesome Full Moon sets on Echo Bridge soon. If you enjoy these it is pretty easy to find Gingerdead Man and Killer Bong on some other Echo Bridge sets.,1349222400,2,438,4.093023255813954
2381966,5,B000A8OJOK,I had seen this movie many years ago. My daughter tried to find it at a video place and said that she couldn't find it. I was bragging to her after I found the dvd for sale and ordered it. I was very pleased as it was in great shape and I will watch this many times. Thanks for the great deal and I definitely am a satisfied customer!,1322524800,,334,3.8550724637681157
2381986,3,B000A8OJOK,"I'm a big Puppet Master fan and I used to love this movie, but I watched it a few days ago and I thought that it was average at best. It's not bad at all, but it's nowhere near as good as I remembered. It's pretty damn boring! The puppets are awesome (O RLY?) and the special effects are pretty damn good, but the characters are very forgettable! I didn't really care about any of them. Basically, the puppets are the only interesting things in the movie. The parts without the puppets are not interesting at all. I'm sorry, guys, I used to love most of the Puppet Master movies, but now the only PM movie that I love is the third one. It's very entertaining, the plot is very good, the puppets are even more awesome than in the first 2 and the characters are great.

Watch the third one instead.",1259280000,,796,4.2368421052631575
2381987,4,B000A8OJOK,"I bought this movie because I had seen it as a kid, and I loved scary movies. This is a typical 80's horror flick with bad special effects, but I was so glad that I found a copy of it since I didn't think it was being produced anymore. The cover was written all in spanish, but the movie is in english. I am very happy with the purchase, but beware that its pretty cheesy!",1238716800,,372,3.973333333333333
2381988,4,B000A8OJOK,"This tense Full Moon Features thriller stars Paul LeMat and Golden Globe winner Irene Miracle as two of a group of psychics who are summoned to a California hotel, not knowing it is for their executions at the hands of five murderous... puppets?

It may sound like a ripoff of Child's Play, but this movie has a far more ambiguous plot.  The dolls don't really come front and center until the final third of the movie, and Irene Miracle is very good at playing the bitchy Dana Hadley.  This DVD is in fullscreen, as the movie was released directly to video, although it was produced as a theatrical feature, so a widescreen print is out there somewhere. :)  This DVD was made from a good print of the film and has the trailer, a making of featurette and bios for stars LeMat, Miracle, and William Hickey, as well as filmographies for the rest of the cast and crew.

There are several editions available of Puppet Master, but this is by far the best DVD you can find for it.  The current ""official"" release is a Spanish-subtitled edition (in English with optional Spanish subtitles, and Spanish packaging) with decent quality, but not as good as this, and includes virtually the same extras.  And there is also a 3D Uncut version available, but the quality is slightly below VHS quality and has no extras.  The best value is in the Puppet Master series boxed set from FullMoonDirect.com and includes THIS edition of Puppet Master 1.",1237852800,,1431,4.628458498023716
2381989,4,B000A8OJOK,"This is actually one of my favorite horror-films of all:)The story has a nice twist to it,but kind of drags a little. The killer puppets serve an unusual master in this one. The ending leaves some unanswered questions which should be revealed in the sequel but aren't mentioned at all. But beyond that it's a great movie!",1226793600,,321,4.649122807017544
2381990,4,B000A8OJOK,"All horror fans are familiar with Puppet Master whether they've actually seen any of the films or not.  Full Moon's first and most popular franchise is also probably their best.
While Puppet Master will never be considered high art or pulse poundingly frightening, it's a fun movie.  The first film is obviously the best of the bunch.  It tells the tale of a group of psychics who are drawn to a hotel where puppet maker Andre Toulon hid his creations before his suicide many years ago.  Seems that one of the psychic clan had gone out on his own to discover Toulon's secret of everlasting life and married the heiress to the hotel in order to find the puppets and discover the secret.  Once at the hotel, the psychics-which consist of a feisty fortune teller, a horny couple who use their psychic gifts for more saucy studies, and the straight man who has dreams of the future-start falling victim to the evil puppets.  Also roaming around is their old colleague who is now resurrected and in cahoots with the puppets.
The movie is definitely better than it probably should be.  It's not scary but does manage some creepy atmospheric moments and has a good soundtrack.  The puppets themselves are violent little critters.  They don't speak, but utter sighs and groans and show emotion through subtle movements and facial expressions.  Stop motion animation is used to show movement in the full body shots where the puppets have to run, walk, jump, etc.  Some folks say it looks fake, but considering the budget, it really doesn't look bad at all.  It's used briefly and sparingly, and in my opinion, looks quite good.  Too many people are spoiled by the damn CGI anymore.
But any way you slice it, Puppet Master is a cheap, fun and entertaining little picture.  It's just too bad Full Moon doesn't do films of this caliber anymore.",1215820800,2,1832,4.702194357366771
2381991,3,B000A8OJOK,"The Puppet Master series has always been familiar to me, but despite being a horror film fanatic, I had never watched a single one of the 9 or so films. I just didn't feel that killer puppet movies could be interesting or entertaining. (Oddly enough, I like the first 3 Child's Plays films! Go figure!) So a friend of mine let me borrow his Puppet Master Boxset, after being shocked that I had never seen any of them. He said they were good, but to be honest, I wasn't expected much. After viewing this first film, I gotta say I was a bit surprised in the fact it was a pretty decent movie. For what kind of movie it was, and how cheaply it was made, you can't ask for much better than this. The basic story to the film was much more realistic than I had thought it would be. The story is about 3 psychics who visit an Inn to find a former colleague of theirs, who they think has somehow summoned them all there for some special purpose. It is later found out that the former colleague has discovered an ancient secret that allows inanimate objects to come to live from studying the works of a puppeteer named Andre Toulon. The acting, though not great, wasn't horrible, and the effects were actually done fairly well (considering the budget this film was made with). Again, don't expect anything amazing here. The movie's editing leaves something to be desired at times, and you can see strings on the puppets at times (and even part of an arm of a puppeteer in one shot!)But the title of the movie itself should let you know what to expect out of a film like this one. With that said, this a decent little independent horror film that it definitely worth a viewing or two. Definitely recommended for horror fanatics!!!",1194220800,,1720,4.429022082018927
2381992,4,B000A8OJOK,"What I like about PUPPET MASTER is what I enjoy about many FULL MOON productions, that being it's weirdness. Here we have killer puppets, but not just some tired old clowns or whatever. These puppets are different! We get Blade w/ his knife and hook combo! Leach Woman and her mouth full of bloodsuckers! Tunneler's drill-head! And Pinhead w/ his super strength! There's also Alex (Paul LeMatt), whose pre-cognitive abilities lead him and his fellow psychics into the hands of the deadly dolls of doom! Oh sure, it's goofy, but it's also fun to watch...",1186444800,,553,4.831578947368421
2381993,3,B000A8OJOK,"Overall, this is rather one of the pathetic B-horror movies of the late '80s along with ""Night of the Demons"" and, let's not forget, the ouija board film ""Witchboard"", a film made by Kevin Tenney who also produced ""Night of the Demons"" and ""Witchtrap"".

  Now, I'm obviously a male and one in his prime when I go into the next topic of this film. The erotic sex scene, played by Kathryn O'Reilly and a male actor that I care nothing for, is incredible. I have to admit that I have never seen a woman so sexually charged in front of a camera. It is obvious that it was all fake just by taking a quick glance at the bedsheets when she is on top of him. But, regardless, I'm sure that most heterosexual men that view this part of the film think one thing: ""How come my girl doesn't do me like that?""

  Maybe, that could be a cue for women who complain about never getting any from their mates. Well, some of the best tips are actually in these B-horror films. They may have been rediculous regarding acting abilities and authentic appearances of the physical matter. But, the ideas for eroticism are actually more enticing than Playboy or your local Barnes & Noble psychology section of sexuality books.

  Anyways, if you're looking for some legitimate scares from a horror film, Puppet Master does not hit the spot unless you're seriously paranoid about dolls coming to life. THEN, maybe there's a shot for a few frights. But, if you are seeking inexpensive ways to induce your lover into more foreplay without the overly explicit material of pornography, B-horror films are an optional source. Some scares, kinky scenes of imagination, and some actors to laugh at and wonder ""how the %&*% they got on the set in the first place"", then it's a date!",1170806400,,1748,4.559105431309904
2381994,5,B000A8OJOK,"Low-budget horror movies are often unwatchably bad.  A lot of thought and effort went into this one, however.  The result is that it's something of a classic in the killer doll/killer puppet genre.  Of course, it's meant to be funny, but not in a self-consciourly ironic or over-the-top way.  It still has elements of genuine horror.  The sequels seemed to get progressively worse, but 2 and 3 aren't bad.",1142640000,2,405,4.811594202898551

8076529,4,B000A8OJOK,"If you like a B movie collection to watch this is an interesting set that takes me back a few years.  Some of the movies were actually pretty good in this series, others were not but for the price you cannot miss on this collection.  The picture quality looks like it was mastered off of a VHS tape on some so the picture is grainy and sometimes jerky on those.  Also, Killjoy did not come with this collection, only the Puppet Master movies were present.  Again, for the price, what can you really expect?  Still, for the movies in the series that I really wanted, it was worth the purchase.",1510099200,,592,4.345454545454546
