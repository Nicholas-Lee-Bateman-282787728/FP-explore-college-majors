8166877,2,B000M7XR6K,"It is a poor copy of what they claim the Passion of Christ. It was poorly directed, they made the Catholics look bad yet they quoted and copy most of the scenes based on the Catholic faith. Can I return this back? what a waste of time. I though all the while it was the story of the real Joshua but the movie is disgusting. Very poor and not recommended to anyone.",1378771200,,364,4.069444444444445
8166878,5,B000M7XR6K,Great movie. The pain & suffering of Joshua throughout the entire movie was so convincing however the end was not what I expected. Acting was excellent. The entire movie kept me on my toes.,1353801600,,189,4.588235294117647
8166879,5,B000M7XR6K,"This is a film which talks about a Jewish young man who has been asked to leave his country to avoid persecution.
He ends up in a new town, and he is asked to play the Messiah. But it has become a very complicated situation.

The story is interesting, as you are not sure how they will execute the familiar story line.",1278028800,,318,4.129032258064516
8166880,4,B000M7XR6K,"In 1492, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand declared Spain to be a Roman Catholic country, and that the Jews and Moslems who had peacefully coexisted as Spaniards for centuries were now given three months to leave the country...for good.

THE PASSION OF JOSHUA,THE JEW is a very clever film that delves into the historical aspects of two families,one Jewish and the other Moslem,who had been friends and take different paths eventually in fleeing Spain. The script,though, centers on the Jewish family and they head for ""safe haven."" What essentially is the crux of this film is the family's arrival in a town where they must disguise themselves as Christians at the feast of ""The Carazza"" or Passion Play. This is the event of the Easter scene each year and everyone has a part. What so cleverly and sadly happens is when the son,Joshua, plays the the part of Jesus, The Messiah, actually believing that he IS the Messiah!.It ends up rather tragically.

This film is a clever and stinging indictment on the Catholic Church and their persecution of the Jews in following years leading into The Inquisition. This is an odd,yet very interesting twist on how the Spanish Inquisition was very much another 33AD Passion Play gone bed!.Unique and highly recommended.

That this film quotes and apology from the now deceased Pope John Paul with an apology to the Jews for The Catholics part in their mistreatment is all the more poignant at the conclusion of this film.",1195084800,2,1461,4.883064516129032
