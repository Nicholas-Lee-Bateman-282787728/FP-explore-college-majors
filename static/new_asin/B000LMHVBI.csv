The video content on the DVD is the same but the video itself is not up to DVD quality.  The DVD looks like it was copied from the VHS video tape.  Some of the video has color shifting and there is a line at the bottom of the video.  Some of the scenes seem to be less bright and the video is slightly grainy.  The VHS tape appears to have better quality.  I am keeping the DVD version however since it's more convenient.  I will live with it.

When HGTV was showing gardening shows, it was so much easier to find good garden videos.  Now they're hard to find and many only exist in the original VHS format.  I wish there were good Blu-ray garden videos, maybe someday.",1293408000,7,807,4.050632911392405

different.  I watched it with my mother as she lives for flowers and plants
and she knew some of them in the movie.  My parents have been to Europe, but
they didn't see this particluar place.  The narrator's accent was a little
hard to understand, but we still watched it.",1250208000,,351,4.3538461538461535
