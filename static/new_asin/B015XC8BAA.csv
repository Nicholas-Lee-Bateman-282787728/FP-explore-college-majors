8734943,2,B015XC8BAA,"I gave this movie a 2 because of Tasha Smith and Amin Joseph. I also liked Antonique Smith, but this movie left so many unanswered questions. My husband and I watched it together and at the end, we were asking...what did he do with the money if he didn't keep it for himself, what was her exact occupation, etc. We liked the soundtrack.",1488153600,,336,4.349206349206349
