8615710,5,B00FGVS0IW,"I watched Piggley Winks religiously when PBS started airing them a few years ago.  My two year old grandnephew loves these stories, which are a Grandfather's perspective of his childhood that he shares with his three grandchildren.  I've purchased both used and new versions of various Jakers Piggley Winks to share with the younger generation of grandkids and grand friends that range in age from eighteen months to ten years of age.  Everyone loves these, no matter how OLD you are.  Although two of the kids live in Puerto Rico, they too enjoy the English version which is the best way to go to truly enjoy the Irish brogue and Celtic expressions.  Terrific!!!!",1391472000,4,664,4.84070796460177
