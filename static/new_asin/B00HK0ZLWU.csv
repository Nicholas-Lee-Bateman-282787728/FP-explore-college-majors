8633175,5,B00HK0ZLWU,"Great original tunes in background (upbeat, happy little ditties, but not childish at all). Constant switching of clear easy-to-see pictures of wildlife (babies and moms too). The pictures are on screen about 15 seconds each, long enough for person with dementia to focus on and figure out what it is, but not so long it's boring. Keeps person with middle stage dementia entertained, while still being entertaining to family/visitors without dementia.
I thought it was perfect for a person who likes wildlife.",1400803200,,509,5.219512195121951
