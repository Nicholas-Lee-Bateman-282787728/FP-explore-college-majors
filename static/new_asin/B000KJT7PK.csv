8325308,5,B000KJT7PK,"I got this DVD for my 3 year old niece, specifically for when I baby-sit her, which is often.  She's a sweet, beautiful child, but also ...um... let's just say she can be a handful.  I have tried lots of books, games, crafts, and other videos, but so far this DVD is the best.  As soon as I bring out the DVD, she gets excited at first, but then sits right down to get ready for the show.  She really enjoys the monkey & banana segments.  And I really enjoy a little peace and quiet!",1212105600,,483,4.042105263157895
8325309,5,B000KJT7PK,"I saw the video at a friends house and I was so impressed by the breadth of topics and themes that I immediately got the DVD for my nieces, ages 5 and 7.  I know my sister-in-law will love having her daughters exposed to famous artwork - and learning a few French words too.  I hope this sparks an interest in them to learn more about France and other countries.",1211846400,,362,4.1571428571428575
8325310,5,B000KJT7PK,I got this for my 4-year old who grew out of the Baby Einstein dvd's.  She loves it!  It's very educational so you don't feel guilty about turning it on when you need to get stuff done.  Her 2-year old brother even enjoys it (he LOVES the monkey puppet). I can't wait for the next one in the series to come out!,1166313600,3,311,3.9838709677419355
8325311,5,B000KJT7PK,"Fabulous, educational and entertaining DVD for young children. I'm a former teacher, grandmother and artist. The music, art and activities keep children interested while learning. The puppets are a delight and the movement from pictures to puppets to live children while listening to music make this DVD a real winner. What a way to have kids entertained and learn at the same time! I look forward to the next country Magellan will be visiting! By comparison, I have viewed Baby Einstein DVD's.

Magellan's World France content and presentation is far and above the Baby Einstein DVD's/videos .

Enjoy!",1166227200,2,602,5.13265306122449
