This movie will take you on a journey and an emotional roller coaster of feelings.  You can feel the emotions of all the characters and what they go through. Our lives are truly based on ""The choices we make are the only thing we own.""  I'm glad I made the choice to see this movie.",1505347200,,436,4.2682926829268295
8410621,5,B003ZMCD32,"I had the privilege of watching this movie a few months back, and thought it was very well put together, a movie you don't want to pause for any reason and get up, you'll want to watch it more than once, I promise you!",1503446400,,218,3.977272727272727
8410622,1,B003ZMCD32,"Dr. Mike Taylor and former Gold Glover? (Marvin Faulkner) grieves over the death of his wife who suffered. He questions his faith as he turns to the Bible and like most Christians, he can't get past chapter one. He visits a bar where prostitutes and dancers frequent. While nearly passed out drunk, he witnesses a murder of Mary (Britt Mceachern) a dancer he saw in the bar. He reports it to the policeman Steve McGill (Jeff Wallin) who we know is the guy who killed her. She had been having an affair with his brother Jim (Andrew Sensenig) who likes dancers.

The relationships in the film are twisty, but not the plot. This would have been a great film with Michael Madsen done grindhouse style, but as a film that borders on a faith based Lifetime film trying way to had to convey the message of Job, it was boring to watch.

The acting was bad, especially the lead characters. The soundtrack was TV lame. The sound inside a room had an echo effect, not heard on polished productions. The film drops a few F-bombs to ward off its target audience while using discreet camera angles to prevent any nudity. It seems they really didn't want anyone to watch it.

On a technical note, the DVD opens in an opening loop from which you can't start to the film. I had to go to ""set up"" on the remote as even ""disc menu"" didn't work.

$1.99 Mountain View Movies. I got suckered by the cover.",1417046400,2,1383,4.411764705882353

8410624,5,B003ZMCD32,"Marvin Faulkner and crew, through a provocative story of murder and corruption, have provided a realistic look at a number of life's existential issues - from the impact of deeply felt grief to the need to find purpose in life. This film is quite profound and engaging. In fact, each time I view it, new details emerge that add to the story's complexities and meaning. The quality of the film itself, including the directing and visual effects, is surprisingly excellent. Clearly, a great deal of time and care went into the writing and creating of this important work. Also, a special treat on the DVD is the very moving music video featuring the amazing voice of Ali Faulkner. I have to say it is rare these days to discover a film that is true to life but also offers a spiritual perspective without sermonizing. Faulkner's movie touched me unlike any other in recent years. A true gem.",1295222400,,889,4.6687898089171975
8410625,4,B003ZMCD32,"I got an advance copy of this DVD and was very pleased with it.  Overall the story is good.  There are enough twist and turns to keep it interesting.  It seems that everyone in this story has some kind of skeleton in their closet and that the murder of a local call girl is causing the skeletons to come out dancing!  The DVD has some nice features that are not expected on most films of this caliber.

I found the directors commentary interesting to listen to, these guys sound like they have put a lot of thought into their film.  Also the DVD contains a music video and a sit down interview with the director, producer and the editor.

This is a great rental but I would own it as well.  The story gets better after multiple viewings because you are always realizing some new detail.",1286150400,2,786,4.335616438356165
