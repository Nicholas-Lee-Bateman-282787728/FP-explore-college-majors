2001315,5,B0001H9SCI,"Charles Willeford's 1960 novel, The Woman Chaser is the eccentric author's most cinematic construction.  Herein protagonist Richard Hudson recollects his days as a used car salesman turned movie director in quasi-screenplay style, preceding every transition in the novel with direction such as ""CROSSFADE"", ""DISSOLVE"", or ""FADE TO BLACK.""

  Unsatisfied with his successful used car business, huckster Richard Hudson suddenly gets the bug to create.  Turning to his former film producing step father (Paul Malevich), Hudson takes his idea for THE MAN WHO GOT AWAY to ""The Man"" (Ernie Vincent)--the big studio bigwig.  Contrasting insouciance with wild turns of emotion, Patrick Warburton plays Hudson with panache.  The actor often wears a mask of indifference, slightly squinting at scenery as if trying to make sense of Hollywood.  It's only after he dons a conspicuous set of sunglasses that he can operate in this foreign place with all the autonomous command he had over his car lot.  His deadpan narration holds true to Hudson's sociopathic outlook on life.  Hudson is a [...]and makes no bones about it.  His moral ambiguity frees him to be completely outrageous in his appraisals of the world and unapologetic in his heinous actions.

  Bedding his step sister (Marilyn Rising), secretary (Emily Newman), lead actress (Lora Witty), and a Salvation Army Captain (Pat Crowder), Hudson's real love proves to be his mother (Lynette Bennett).  His frenzied, shirtless dance scene with her is truly unforgettable.  Likewise, much of Hudson's dialogue proves highly quotable.

  Undoubtedly, director Robinson Devor could sympathize with Hudson's first attempt to make a full length feature film.  Running six full reels, Devor's film is free from unnecessary padding and moves at a breakneck pace.  With a budget on par with Hudson's film within Devor's film,  THE WOMAN CHASER has tremendous production value.  Devor's screenplay is delightfully accurate in its adaptation of Willeford's work, not only in being faithful to the tone of the book but in keeping ninety-percent of the original dialogue.

  Hudson's hardboiled demeanor, the flashback framing device, the use of Milkos Rozsa theme from THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, and an inherent moral ambiguity might lead critics to assume that THE WOMAN CHASER is a ""modern day film noir.""  Indeed, THE WOMAN CHASER has an absurdity reminiscent of the work of Edgar G. Ulmer, but there is a modernity and self-reflexivity in Willeford's scenarios that puts THE WOMAN CHASER heads and shoulders above films that try to ape the classic noir traits.

  Originally shot in color, THE WOMAN CHASER had a limited theatrical run in breathtaking black & white but was released briefly (available exclusively at Hollywood Video) on VHS in color. Still available used via online retailers, no DVD release is in sight.",1149120000,8,2851,5.313199105145414

8012502,3,B0001H9SCI,"Fairly faithful to the book, until the very end. The ""hero"" in the book is really an anti-hero, which is proven by how he gives the secretary he has impregnated an impromptu abortion by punching her in the gut. They left this out of the movie in order to make the character likable. The narration they add proves that they did this on purpose. Of course, after 90 minutes of a fairly faithful adaption, they veer dramatically off course with this move. I realize that it makes the movie more palatable, and less disturbing, but what's the point of sticking so close to the book, and then, in the last two minutes, completely watering it down? Richard Hudson is a contemptible, evil narcissist, not some kind of post-modern hero.",1493510400,,728,4.651162790697675

8012509,5,B0001H9SCI,"I saw this movie at the Laemmle's Sunset 5 after seeing a tiny square ad in the LA Weekly, figuring it wouldn't last the week. (I was right.) I got on the phone immediately after the movie was over, calling everyone I knew like a lunatic, telling them that this movie is THE REASON I go to movies. It was gorgeous in its black and white images of Cadillacs and Brylcream, was darkly hilarious and had a groovy soundtrack. I'm a big fan of Patrick Wharburton and now Robinson Devor.

I've purchased a handful of VHS copies of this movies to give as gifts. This movie is, no joke, an ALL-TIME favorite. (Please release on DVD already!!)",1315958400,9,634,4.418803418803419
