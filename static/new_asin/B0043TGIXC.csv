4257614,5,B0043TGIXC,"I caught this little gem before it was released on DVD. This film takes you on a wonderful journey of unexpected endings and an insight into the Life of Reilly. His stories about family and love and rejection and hope are so touching and heartfelt. He was a true actor, gentleman and performer. I did not know much about Charles Nelson Reilly other than his seated antics and quips of Matchgame. But, his life was so much more and his interpretation and performance were a true treat to watch.",1286409600,2,493,4.550561797752809
4257615,5,B0043TGIXC,This is a masterpiece of comedy. Charles Nelson Reilly must be one of the most under rated performers of his time. It is hilarious and poignant at the same time as he narrates the story of his life. I regret not ever seeing this live as he was touring.,1286409600,3,252,4.163265306122449
4257616,5,B0043TGIXC,"You'll laugh, you'll cry it's better than Cats!! But seriously it's touching and entertaining. It shows you the talent and character of Charles Nelson Reilly.",1286409600,2,158,5.36
4257617,5,B0043TGIXC,"If you recognize the name, you must see CNR's one man autobiographical show.  Charles is on point with his wisdom, comedy, and humanity. The show is priceless and reminds me that life is precious and that talent is talent no matter one's age, orientation or history.  Life of Reilly is a gift to us all.  It is an honor and my responsibility to write a review after being a child who was entertained by this great talented man though Match Game, Lidsville, and Ghost and Mrs. Muir.  His history is beautiful and rich. His relationship with his mother is brought to you with depth, humor, and compassion.  There is no question.  You must purchase this video and have Life of Reilly parties with your friends.  Hats off to you Charles for leaving us with this parting gift.",1286409600,2,771,4.583941605839416
4257618,5,B0043TGIXC,"I was prepared to laugh at a kitchy icon from the 70's.  I ended up laughing with an insightful, intelligent, hilarious man.

4257619,5,B0043TGIXC,I saw this filmed stage performance and it's wonderful. Mr. Reilly had a fascinating life and weaves the story with wit as well drama. He was an amazing actor. This is a must have in any DVD collection.,1286409600,2,202,4.342105263157895
4257620,5,B0043TGIXC,"The Life of Reilly is the film version of Charles Nelson Reilly's autobiographical one-man show.  It is brilliant, hilarious, and in every way extraordinary.  I knew almost nothing of Reilly before watching this film, save some vague childhood memories of his guest appearances on game and talk shows in the 1970s.  Turns out he had an amazing life - on the stage, on television, in Hollywood and behind closed doors.

I can't praise this film highly enough - Reilly is a master storyteller who controls the pace and tone of his narrative like nothing I'd ever seen.  He is 100% entertaining from start to finish. I laughed, I cried -- no, really, these are the kind of stories that make you weep one moment and then laugh through your sniffles the next -- and I really want to buy this two disc special edition but Amazon doesn't seem to have it available.  Why?  Go get it, Amazon, so i can buy it from you, and other people can buy it too.  No one should miss this film.

Kudos to filmmakers Barry Poltermann and Frank Anderson for the fine job they did capturing the Reilly experience and preserving it for posterity.",1278460800,25,1121,4.565

4257635,5,B0043TGIXC,"Absolutely one of the most genuine and entertaining theatrical pieces I have ever witnessed.  Charles Nelson takes us from his childhood in the Bronx to the present day.  You will laugh often, and cry at times.  This story of an overbearing mother, who seemingly did all that she could to make a nearsighted Jewish boy in the Bronx an absolute outcast, through his years in theater preparation, to his hardships with love and eventual WORLD WIDE FAME.

He never minces words, and often scolds the audience for making assumptions.  He remembers his beloved celebrity friends, living and dead, and definitely throws out quite a few surprises related to his friendships, both on and off the stage.

A great story that could never have been told by anyone else.  Charles Nelson Reilly is so unbelievably frank and straightforward, that you honestly get lost in the tale.  A mesmerizing trip into the life of a great actor.",1459641600,,918,4.877419354838709
4257636,5,B0043TGIXC,"I never was a huge fan, but this intrigued me. It is an extraordinary review of a life. Fortunately, there is very little (read as nothing) said about game shows. Reilly was far more than Match Game. His growing up years and family life borders on Kafka and his being in the wrong place at the wrong time (the Hartford circus fire) left him emotionally scarred his entire life. If you're curious at all about his generation of performers, this is an education. His stellar performance, so close to his death, makes this all the more interesting and captivating.",1456099200,2,561,4.6767676767676765
4257637,5,B0043TGIXC,"please believe me when I say that ""The Life of Reilly"" is one of the best things ever written

As many of my friends and family can tell you, I'm a harsh critic of entertainment. That's especially true of stage shows, and even more so it's a one-man/woman production. So, please believe me when I say that ""The Life of Reilly"" is one of the best things ever written, and nearly perfect in its performance by Charles Nelson Reilly. Poignant, touching, funny, entertaining, and life-altering as just a few descriptors that come to mind. CNR was one of the most underrated actors in history, and although most people knew him only as a wacky comic who did the occasional commercial, or as a game show mainstay of the 1970s, his training and talent were much more impressive than that.

In this recording of his one-man autobiographical show, Reilly tells you, as he puts it, ""the story of my life."" It's full of heartbreak, insanity, bizarre family members, his struggles to work in a homophobic Old Hollywood (""We don't put f@gs on TV!"", one director told him), and is told with such tenderness and humor that you'll not only fall in love with him, but also learn a lot from his life.",1452297600,,1182,4.597156398104265
4257638,5,B0043TGIXC,"This was a wonderful look at Charles Nelson Reilly's life.  Even if he hadn't been famous, this life would be worth hearing about.  It was so interesting.  I think even people who don't know who he was will like this film.",1439510400,,222,4.365853658536586

4257640,5,B0043TGIXC,"I was shocked and delighted to hear Mr. Reilly describe his ""terrible habit"" of perusing the TV Guide each week to see how many times he would be on.  WE USED TO DO THAT TOO!  My whole family loved him and looked forward to tuning in to whatever show he was going to be on.  I, however, had an ulterior motive.  Charles Nelson Reilly taught me how diffuse dangerous (abusive) situations comically while maintaining my own integrity and without resorting to self deprecation.  He was (and now IS) a hero to me.  I shall treasure this DVD, both versions, always.",1430784000,,560,4.55
4257641,5,B0043TGIXC,"THE best autobiographical monologue I have ever seen. Just when you think he is taking you down one path, he changes directions entirely, which keeps the presentation fresh at all times. It is moving, beautiful, funny, sad, rage-invoking, and incredulous just to name a small few of the feelings which are invoked throughout. Thank you, Mr. Reilly, wherever you are, for sharing with us the story of your life.",1430006400,,410,4.956521739130435

4257650,3,B0043TGIXC,"I was expecting more of a serious autobiographic movie, not a comical ""stand up routine"" made up of his life experiences. The movie was good, it just was not what I was expecting or hoping for. I loved Charles Nelson Reilly, I've been watching him since I was a small child and am in my late 40's now. In the time I've gotten to see and read about him throughout my life, I've grown to respect his work as an actor but more than that, appreciate what a great man he must have been. I have not been able to find much to read on him or even find much to watch on DVD on him. I think the most disappointing is that i can't seem to find anything written in his own words. That's Why I was looking so forward to this movie. It's disappointing that he is gone now. He was a true gift to those of us that were blessed to be able to enjoy the different aspects of his acting, both serious and funny.",1402012800,2,891,4.01123595505618

4257652,5,B0043TGIXC,"I was fortunate enough to have seen this production in person down at a small off Broadway theater. It was the weekend after 9/11 and it was a very serious audience indeed. From the moment he stepped on stage, Mr. Reilly had us in the palm of his hand. We laughed (something many of us doubted we would ever do again)and we cried. What a catharsis.  Now I watch CNR on THE MATCH GAME reruns, only for him and he never fails to be the irreverent, slightly off kilter persona that I grew up laughing with and, after his one man show, loving. This performance is a joy. Don't miss it!",1388102400,2,581,4.2342342342342345

4257658,5,B0043TGIXC,"There is nothing about this that isn't great.  I've read some reviews on the internet about ""The Life of Reilly"" that say, some of the show was cut quite a bit from the original live show. If true, that is a shame, but I suppose it seemed too long to whomever makes those decisions. I really enjoyed listening to his life and would have loved to seen more.
Charles N Reilly takes you through his life in a manner that is funny, serious, happy, shocking and poignant.
Even if you've never heard of, or seen, Charles Nelson Reilly before in your life, you will enjoy this story. I played this for a group of friends and it's one of the first times we'd ever watch anything together without saying a word, other than laughter.

4257659,5,B0043TGIXC,"I was so looking forward to seeing this program and with all the 5 star reviews perhaps expecting too much. I thought the hand held cameras were a bit too ""jumpy"" and distracting from the program in my view. The film makers to me were looking to stamp THEIR imprint on the proceedings instead of filming a masterpiece. I say that because as unsatisfying as this film (84 minute feature) is... the 3 hour bonus DVD taken from a performance years earlier is just about the most wonderful 3 hours I've ever spent watching a DVD...ever!

The bonus DVD was filmed with only 3 cameras and for me its terrific and covers the show very well , is lit well and unlike the main feature NEVER calls attention to the film making process...its all Charles and his stories.

The bonus features are okay and mostly self serving to the film makers...
the best thing I can say about them is that they've done a great thing by bringing this footage to life... I just will finish by reiterating that the bonus , full 3 hour performance, is simply inspiring , awesome, and something I will repeatedly visit.",1355529600,4,1086,4.50761421319797

No, you go to the ""extra"" disc: The 3 hour (but, it seems like 84 minutes) standard screen video of the show, shot in 2001. This is a brilliant record of a brilliantly funny, sad, witty, clever, actor's life and talent. It is regretable, I suppose, that as marvelous a talent as Reilly's was never really shown off to the degree he deserved (although he DID win those Tonys) but, then, he WAS a singular talent, as well as a singular man.

The only drawback is the annoyingly jerky, quick-cut, often temporarily out of focus camera work.  My friends and I joked that it must have been taped by monkeys with cameras.  In spite of that it's well worth your time to watch this brilliant man tell his life story.",1287273600,2,353,4.754098360655738
4257677,4,B0043TGIXC,"Sweet, sad, and funny, this is a very straightforward filming of
Charles Nelson Reilly's one man autobiographical show.

The show is often surprisingly moving, and often very funny. Some of
the filming is a bit distractingly hand held, and other parts a little flat in
style, but Reilly and his amazing stories always keeps you glued to it.

It's amazing to see how much wit and how much depth there is to a
man most of us knew only as a cartoony game show presence.  A
great argument for not judging a book - or person - by their cover.",1287100800,9,537,4.35
4257678,5,B0043TGIXC,"I have been a fan of Charles Nelson Reilly since 1968, and when I heard about this movie, I made sure to be at the opening in NYC. The show is astoundingly honest, and Charles was an incredibly talented human being. I think he is STILL the funniest person on the planet (and that IS taking into account the fact that he is no longer with us). I urge everyone to throw their preconceptions out the window and buy this DVD! Buy more than one and give them to your friends!",1287100800,3,470,4.175824175824176
4257679,5,B0043TGIXC,CNR is irresistibly human.  Barry & Frank feature him at his best.  The show & movie are brilliantly dynamic.  Funny & heart-wrenching at times.  Just like life.  Beautiful film & man.,1286496000,3,184,4.806451612903226
8415278,5,B0043TGIXC,Some great insights into a person I knew very little about. His stage show is powerfully moving and I'd highly recommend this film version.,1526947200,,139,4.833333333333333
8415279,5,B0043TGIXC,"While you may remember Charles from Match Game or The Tonight Show, these shows are but blips in the exciting story of CNRs life. Having the man himself tell his story, sprinkled with clips and pictures, is truly amazing. Charles is at the saw time funny and heartwarming.",1526601600,,272,4.6875

8415282,3,B0043TGIXC,"If you can get past the terrible shakey camera work and bad cutting this is an ok film of a stage production that Charles did around the country. It is an insight to his life but light on his Hollywood stuff, which I was hoping to get more of.",1517097600,,243,3.979591836734694
