1252724,3,B00002E23H,This is a pretty good movie.  At the time Samuel L. Jackson was the only one in the cast that I had heard of.  And he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.  And I was surprised at what happened to him.  Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane are the stars.  They play scientists doing research on sharks.

1252865,3,B00002E23H,"Deep Blue Sea is a movie I clearly remember having low expectations for before I even first watched it at age 11.  I still remembered it being very watchable though, so I decided to sit down with it again after over a decade.  To me, this is a classic shark movie with a lot of big flaws, but overall a very enjoyable 100 minutes.

Whatever the special effects budget was for DBS, it was certainly very well-spent.  The various scenes involving flooding water look great, and provide for some of the most tense moments as everybody has to escape through many sealed doors.  The CGI for the sharks doesn't look great even for 1999 (think Sharknado) but it's used sparingly.  What really stands out are the set designs and the practical effects of the sharks.  This is a small movie in time and space, but the various sets of the underwater research facility all have their own unique look, which changes drastically as throughout the movie many of them are flooded with water and their lights go out.  This makes the movie seem so much bigger.  The animatronic sharks are also very good, and provide for most of the really good sequences.

That is what was good, and what's left are the writing, directing, and the acting.  The least poor of these is the acting; this is a great cast, and I really think they mostly do the best with what's there to work with.  I had a little bit of morbid laughter at some of Samuel L. Jackson's delivery, but his iconic death scene still stands as one of the best surprise screen slayings to date.  Too bad that after that point, the pacing of the film goes haywire, hardly ever stopping to let the characters take a breath as they run from certain death for a good 30 minutes straight.  This gets pretty tiresome, and some short quieter scenes before the big finish come as a big relief.  The dialogue has lots of melodramatic confrontations, some really bad character exposition, and plenty of lines that make no sense at all.  Most of the attempts at humor fall flat or are just plain bad (a certain joke about batteries near the end is especially terrible).  The exception to that is LL Cool J, who pretty much steals the whole movie playing the most (or only) likable character.  He truly made the most of getting all the best lines in the movie, especially when he calls out the worst trope of the horror genre.

This movie has lots of symptoms of a studio jumping on a trend; the script clearly didn't get rewrites that were sorely needed, or a better director who had some kind of pedigree in horror.  Honestly, I didn't even think this was scary at age 11.  For every part of the story that makes sense, another makes none at all.  Why did Michael Rappaport's character need to have spent ""four years at Cal Tech"" when he has a thick Long Island accent?  Why is there only about a half a second spent explaining a gigantic explosion early in the movie?  How come nobody tells Burrows Happy Birthday when she arrives earlier in the day, even though they had a party planned that night?  Did they just want her to feel horrible before the big surprise?

Overall, I'd call Deep Blue Sea about half-good, half-bad.  There is enough to make it fun to watch with some friends, but if this is your favorite movie, best you keep that to yourself.  They might look at you funny.",1454630400,,3312,4.484140233722871
1252866,4,B00002E23H,"Man vs. Nature: Man shouldn't mess with nature or Nature will mess with Man!! Rated R for the horror, but all death scenes are well done and not over done, in my opinion. I LOVE that the innocent black guy does NOT die and is a hero. I let my 4th grade son watch it because he loves sharks and Samuel Jackson. He was fine with it.

1252885,4,B00002E23H,"BOTTOM LINE: For dumb scary fun, DEEP BLUE SEA is a pretty good popcorn flick. Head & shoulders above the tidal wave of giant killer shark movies you'll find floating around video stores and thru online retailers. But don't get soaked. Buy it used for cheap and be happy. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers):  Eggheads working at a refurbished WWII submarine refueling base on the Pacific ocean are trying to synthesize a drug that combats the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's, using fluid from the genetically-enlarged brains of three Mako sharks. After spending many months & piles of cash, they're close but have no concrete results. The entrepreneur backing them gives the crew just 48 hours to produce viable results or else he'll shut them down and write off the project. At the proverbial 11th hour the scientists surprise even themselves, creating a protein from the shark brain fluid that seems to reactivate Alzheimer's damaged brain cells ...but their success & celebration is incredibly short-lived when a powerful tropical storm hits the sea base. The three huge, abnormally-intelligent test sharks take advantage of the opportunity and orchestrate a fiendishly clever plan to trick the scientists into unwittingly releasing these mutant apex predators back into the Deep Blue Sea. Trapped out in the middle of the ocean, with no way escape or call for help, the heavily damaged complex inexorably sinking around them and three huge, highly intelligent sharks looking for a quick snack before heading out to sea, what will this handful of very smart but also very weary and very scared people do? Who will survive?

THOUGHTS: This is another of those silly yet fun nature-on-the-loose movies in the tradition of ANACONDA & LAKE PLACID where you just put your thinker in neutral and enjoy the mindless mayhem. You'll have to suspend your disbelief, because the F/X in DEEP BLUE SEA are quite dated since this was filmed during the adolescent days of CGI. Many shots are pretty cringe-worthy now, but no more so than stop-motion effects were way back in the day, I suppose. Just use your imagination and go with it. Thankfully, the full-size animatronic sharks kick things up a notch, as they are very cool and believably realistic. Most of the acting ensemble (among them a woodenly macho Thomas Jane, amiable Michael Rapaport, L.L. Cool J, and soon-to-be Thor's pal, Stellan Skarsgrd) seems to be having a good time, delivering silly dialogue that's cornier than a silo full of Jiffy Pop, (but that usually goes hat-in-hand with this kind of film). Samuel L. Jackson is the most polished member of the cast, and gets what has to be one of the greatest death scenes ever put on film. (Certainly one of the most memorably shocking!) Director Renny (DIE HARD 2) Harlin engineers the entire movie like one, long cinematic spookhouse funride. And it works for the most part.

THE BLU-RAY: Nothing to exactly cheer about, the Blu-ray for DEEP BLUE SEA is a decent if unspectacular affair. Good sharp picture and a solid level soundmix help make this a worthy purchase if you have a Blu player but don't yet own the film. If you've got the DVD then I cannot fully recommend a double-dip. The bonus features have merely been ported over from the DVD; (audio commentary with Renny Harlin & Samuel L. Jackson, 2 mini-featurettes, deleted scenes & the theatrical trailer).",1448236800,4,3380,4.955908289241623

First off, the whole architecture of the research structure and the idea of it I think is pretty cool.  For anyone with a scientific bent, maybe with some naturalism thrown in, this might be a good movie.  It is more or less a plausible story behind the science, and the adventure flow of the movie along with the architecture of the station is what did it for me.  It's basically a research station in the middle of the ocean that goes down many stories, with large, enclosed pens for the sharks.  A fun ride",1447200000,,573,4.220183486238532

I like Sharks and action movies, but the other reviewers who gave this film 1 or 2 stars got it right this film stinks.  The sharks look so polished they resembled more of Killer Whales rather than great white sharks.  The characters and plot are silly maybe it would have been a better movie if the sharks ate the whole cast and just swam out to sea.  The scene where the sharks swim backwards was ridiculous. When the film came out CGI was being used more and more exclusively but this is one of those films that desperately needed character development and less of seeing the sharks.  What made Jaws so scary was not being able to see the monster beneath the waves until very late in the movie.  The movie built tension and suspense with a solid story of likeable characters.  Deep Blue Sea has none of that just a mindless cast of generic characters and bad set pieces.

This is one of those films about: ""Look what stupid humans did to create monsters (in this case, sharks) for our own profit (in this case, for Alzheimer's drug research), and lo and behold, our creations turn on us in the most horrible way (they eat us)"".  The special effects (the sharks) won't wow you, but they're pretty good.  The story is somewhat unbelievable, but it's real enough to keep you engaged.  And let's face it, everybody fears being eaten by a shark, no matter how close they ever come to the ocean, so the constant scrambling by the characters to avoid this fate is sympathetic, at the very least.  Saffron Burrows, as the scheming, hard-assed doctor in charge of this doomed crew, is very good.  She gives the term ""ice cold bitch"" new meaning.  Samuel Jackson as her financial backer, trying to decide if he will pull his funding after an ""accident"", is a great foil for her.  Worth a rental.",1415836800,3,1092,4.6217616580310885

Even up until now, the special effects and acting held up really well. Its basically a B rated flick with a bigger budget. A pretty good blend of animatronics and CGI and that went well for 1999. Looking back at this film, it had some promising points and of course, Samuel L. Jackson is one of the few actors that can make a film that isn't that great to begin with and make it look better. Well, up until he died in the middle of this film, but anyway the rest of it really isn't that bad. I like the movie but it didn't knock it out of the park with me. Is it worth getting? If you're into sharks, then get it. If you're looking for something to watch on a rainy day, then give this a try. Should you get this for your own personal video library? Watch the movie first then take it from there.

1252983,3,B00002E23H,"I was not expecting this movie to be a comedy. It wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it's hard to hold a candle to the original ""Jaws."" I will admit I was glued to the screen for most of it. A research company called Aquatica has built an ocean-based holding facility for three genetically modified sharks. Apparently, sharks have a superior nervous system to humans. Their nerve cells do not deteriorate with age, so they do not develop brain-related diseases like Alzheimer's. These three sharks have been manipulated to have larger brains than normal, and they undergo a cruel procedure to have brain tissue removed for lab experiments. Having a bigger brain has apparently made these sharks smarter than normal, and they are out for vengeance! The science stops here, and enter Samuel L. Jackson. He starts giving one of his deep and powerful movie speeches, and what happens next had me doubled over laughing. It is worth watching for that scene alone.
  The sharks look pretty good. If I saw them in real life, I would definitely be scared. But their movement was too fast to be realistic. Isn't the point of GGI to look real? L.L.

The entire cast deliver good Acting Performances, and the awesome Special Effects make Jaws look calm, in comparison to the horror scenes in this film.

It grabs your attention in the beginning with nail-biting anticipation of what comes next, and it delivers unexpected chills-and-thrills to the end. The story holds your attention, and in no time at all, you are sitting on the edge of your seat.

If you were mesmerized with Jaws, you will find 'DEEP BLUE SEA' even more chilling, and entertaining. Suspenseful, thrilling, and chilling. Highly recommended to those who enjoy films packed with intense suspense!",1413331200,,748,5.122950819672131

Saffron Burrows does well playing the role of the deluded scientist who believes that what ever she does is warranted by the potential results.

The special effects work, for the most part. Most significantly, the animatronic sharks that are utilized in superior fashion and seem to be as much living things as their human ""co-stars"".
There is considerable blood-letting and grim human-shark encounters but this plays as more large scale action flick rather than monster/horror film.
And, make no mistake, this is more akin to the film 'Aliens' rather than 'Jaws'.
We could see the ending coming a mile away but this is supreme popcorn fare.

You get the feeling of some sort of weird cross between ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" neither of which is in the same league.  For just a fun-boat ride, try it on for size.

The photo of this movie exaggerates the size of the shark just a tad (a-hem producers & marketers). The actors did well including those sneaky sharks. However, I did eventually feel sorry for their sore noses. I found the film to be quite educational. I had no idea one should use only two eggs in an omelet.

If you want to create or direct a good horor/scary movie,  you want  to have a good plot and you want the characters to outsmart the audience, to do everything they can to avoid being killed. So when they still get killed despite their effort, there will be  an element of surprise for the audience. Only then  a horor movie would deserve to  have 4-5 stars.

Someone made an attempt at a plot, though ""Kill Off Each Character In Allotted Time"" is as much the category it belongs in as anything.  For some vague reason, the scientists are experimenting on sharks, making them BIG and smarter than usual.  So while many people think of sharks in general as quick and effective 'killing machines', the sharks in this film are clever (they've practically learned to open doors) talented (they can jump out o the water to get heir prey), really BIG killing machines.

Samuel L Jackson makes a splash of an exit which is likely not intended to be funny, but it sent us into a laugh out loud fit of giggles.

1253108,3,B00002E23H,"Seeing how well people reacted to seeing a shark in the water during JAWS, it was only inevitable that there would be multiple copycats (or should I say copysharks?) being fished out. Thankfully this one doesn't end up being half bad and manages to stay afloat most of the time.

 Some of the characters are actually pretty interesting. Dr. Susan McAlester is one of them (sort-of). She's been doing experiments on sharks in the hopes of finding a cure for Alzheimer's. The theory is since their brains don't age they can be of some help for us less fortunite humans. But she ignores the warning signs of the sharks becoming TOO smart, and this later comes and bites her in the ass when the founder Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson!) pays a visit.

 There are three sharks in total. Pretty plain looking in color, they're not great whites or anything, but they have big teeth, are large, fast, and mean as hell. Plenty of CGI is used when they're there, and overall it's not too unrealistic.

 They are housed in a walled in water container. In the middle of this confinement is the research lab, which houses the employees. They even have a watchtower/look out.

 Accompanied by the main dr. are some folks who help out which the sharks, notably a shark wrestler type guy named Carter (Thomas Jane) who was in trouble for something involving the large predators in the past. We also have a preacher/worker (LL Cool J) who is hilarious and I devoured his scenes. The doc Susan (Saffron Burrows) is as cold as the fish she takes care of but shows a somewhat thawed heart later on.

 When the first attack occurs (in a pretty shocking, brutal and bloody fashion), there is a massive explosion. The damage is done and their safe haven starts filling up with water! They have to get to the tops but the sharks are hungry and on their trail. We have some juicy tension going down, some pretty good kills and quick shocks, a decent helping of blood and body parts, and the count of shark victims is plentiful.

1253166,5,B00002E23H,"This is not that different from a standard slasher flick in that a small group of people are trapped in one location and picked off one at a time by a killer.  In this case, the killer(s) is a shark(s) made smart to cure Alzheimer's.  The victims (I meant staff) of the outpost, on and under the sea, are pretty standard types.  There's the token hunk (Thomas Jane) with a past that of course gets thrown in his face.  Naturally, there's a mad scientist/amoral cretin in charge (model Saffron Burrows).  Comic relief is offered up by LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport.  Can't get cut off from the world without a dispatcher present (Aida Turturro).  And miscellaneous other bodies and body parts belong to Jacqueline McKenzie and Stellan Skarsgard.  Last but by no means least, the always reliable Samuel L. Jackson shows up as an executive looking out for the financial backers of Aquatica (""looks like Alcatraz floats."").  The plot involves an opportune storm, three sharks looking to bust out, and just a few people in their way (how they hated to snack and run).  When things go wrong they go wrong all at once.  The body count only seems high because the main cast is so low.  At least they had the time to develop personalities first; we wouldn't care otherwise.  The sharks are suitably tricky.  It's a bit like the Poseidon Adventure at times, Jaws too, but that's fine, I'm a firm believer in more of the same rather than just one of a kind.

The acting in all cases was consistent with the demands and possibilities written into the role; only the comic relief was both unnecessary and way, way too anciently stereotypical for an opponent of political correctness to take with ease.
All-in-all, then, I do not think missing the film would create a lacunae in your cultural  experience which you will  regret.

The story begins with two couples on a boat. There is a noise from something hitting the boat! Two fall into the water but are saved from a great white shark. They say 200,000 people suffer from Alzheimer's Disease each year. What if it could be cured by one pill? A man goes swimming with a shark and survives. There are other sharks there. We see how sharks are fed. There is a birthday celebration at night. Can they increase the brains of sharks? Does that violate International Standards? Sharks don't get cancer. [You can't smoke underwater.] The weather report tells of gale force winds coming. What are those sharks doing? They lose the picture from the TV monitor. Carter brings a shark in for a medical exam. ""Bad dream?"" They take a test sample. The results are good.

One man approaches too near for shocking action! They call the paramedics for aerial evacuation during the storm. Something goes wrong and the helicopter crashes into Aquatica! But the lights work. They see an object hit the glass and it begins to crack until the sea pours in! [Poor design and construction?] Are they trapped in there? Carter has a plan to get topside. A door bursts open and water floods in! This is repeated at another room. Did a shark ram through a steel door? ""They are after us!"" We learn how the sharks got smarter. We see people try to escape from water and the sharks. There is anger and conflict among the people. They are told to cooperate to survive. But there is a sudden interruption! OMG! Too much water pressure will crumble the structure. They open an escape hatch and being to climb up a ladder.

The water level rises, and a shark swims around. ""Are you all that made it?"" Two men search for an escape. One man makes a statement to a video recorder. They start a machine. Will another shark show up for another victim? ""Where's Suzy?"" An electric cable fends off a shark attack. Three survivors reach comparative safety. They plan to float upwards in a flooded compartment to reach the open sea. Is there another shark? Bait? [These scenes are amazing and unbelievable!] There is a blast of blood from an explosion! There is a happy ending for the survivors. They see a boat arriving for them.

You can see echoes from other movies (like ""Jaws"") in this drama. It starts off slowly, and the story seems implausible in parts (who paid for that floating laboratory that is far our in the ocean?). Like some other movies it warns against poorly-designed experiments with natural forces. You probably won't want to watch this movie before you go swimming in the ocean. Watching this during ""Hurricane Sandy"" was an ironic coincidence. The `Special Features' explain how the movie was put together using computer generated editing. This allows doing what would be either impossible or at a much higher cost. Those sharks were all robotic models that were remote controlled by computers.

They use some unique processes to genetically enhance the brains of three Mako sharks.  This process enlarges their brains and makes them immensely smarter and more dangerous to handle.  Corporate sends down an executive to check on the progress and to see how the tests are going.  Russell Franklin (Samuel L.

 Anyhow, ""Deep Blue Sea"" is really a great film. Although critics hated it upon its release in 1999 it now has gone on to be a true classic shark film. It's also known for its exceptional cast including Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, and LL Cool J. It is also known for its neat special effects.

 The plot deals with scientists using sharks as a means to discover ways to help the human mind and to deal with mental issues. What they don't realize is that these sharks eventually become intelligent and before everyone realilzes all hell breaks loose as the sharks become determined to escape from their captors.

 The movie was a box office hit making $165,000,000.

 The DVD set includes director/star commentaries, still galleries, and deleted scenes.",1316649600,,1126,4.7384615384615385
1253207,5,B00002E23H,"I really enjoyed Deep Blue Sea.  You've got a pretty interesting storyline (looking to sharks for a cure for Alzheimer's) that rather quickly turns into quite an impressive little disaster movie (I'm talking explosions, fire, and flooding) with the extra bonus of sharks hunting down those trying to survive the whole ordeal.  It's sort of like The Poseidon Adventure - but with sharks.  It gets even better, as the filmmakers throw a couple of significant surprises at the audience along the way.  Anyone who says Deep Blue Sea is wholly predictable couldn't possibly have seen the movie.  The filmmakers really throw down the gauntlet at the very start, showing the viewer that they aren't working with some tired, old, predictable cookie-cutter script.  Throughout it all, the special effects are excellent, and the scenes of the sharks swimming and attacking are very effective (they're animatronic and CGI, but they look real enough to me).  It helps that the sharks involved are mako sharks, best known for the fact that their deadly teeth are plainly visible even when their mouths are closed.  They may not be the biggest sharks in the ocean, but none are more frightening-looking in the water.

Who knew that the secret to curing Alzheimer's disease lay in the brains of nature's perfect killing machine, the shark?  I guess Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) did, having secured the necessary funding to carry out her experiments at an old naval submarine station she renamed Aquatica.  Her work consists mainly of sticking a big needle in the heads of her three mako shark subjects (after they've been subdued and sedated by her team members, of course) and drawing out samples of the precious enzyme she is convinced will prove capable of refiring neurons in dead human brain cells.  Unfortunately, she meets with some inconvenient setbacks, forcing her to accelerate her research before her funding is cut off.  In order to increase the supply of enzymes from the sharks, she resorts to illegal genetic manipulation to increase the sharks' brains by a factor of five.  It really should have come as no surprise that the test sharks would grow significantly more intelligent with their bigger brains, but no one seems to have seen it coming.  These sharks coordinate their attacks, recognize and react to threats against them, and will stop at nothing to kill their human tormentors and make their escape from the facility.  You can't blame the sharks, really - if some alien creature made a habit of sucking juices out of my brain, I would be out for some nasty revenge, too.

While Dr. McCallister is a bit of a cold fish, and her colleagues do little to stir the viewer's emotions, the film does feature three great characters.  Carter Blake (Thomas Jane) is the maverick shark wrangler who becomes the de facto leader of the would-be survivors.  Samuel L. Jackson add his strong imprint to the film in the form of Russell Franklin, the financier of this project who chooses the wrong time to visit Aquatica to determine whether or not to pull the plug on the whole thing.  Then there's Preacher (LL Cool J), who adds a lot of humanity and a bit of comic relief as the cook - he's great in this film, and his modernized version of the 23rd Psalm is really something to hear.

If you're a fan of shark movies, I think you have to put Deep Blue Sea on your must-see list.  Not only is this a real blockbuster of a thriller, the shark attack scenes are very well done.  You're going to see a lot more than just some unfortunate victim disappearing under the water never to return.  And to top it all off, this movie gives you one of the most shocking surprise deaths you're likely to see.",1316131200,,3705,4.77115987460815
1253208,4,B00002E23H,"First off, I love sharks. So I'm pretty picky when it comes to collecting films on these prehistoric beasts. I have two, yes, two shark flicks, both on BD. Everything else is documentary.

Deep Blue Sea is one of the movies I own.

I'm not going to rehash the plot; plenty of folk have done that already. The acting is decent on all fronts; but the actors we're here to watch don't have any lines of dialogue. There are quite a few 'Whoa!"" moments, knocking you back in your seat not because of gore, but just because you didn't expect THAT to happen. But the gore is good too, not over-powering though. There is a lot of situational/ironic comedy (The anti-smoking ad and the chef's special are my favourites). And there are a few cases of 'That would never happen'. But my brain shut off the switch that follows the logic stream and I enjoyed it for what it was: a B-Grade monster flick.

The special features are nothing to scream about; what they have here is pretty much just the expected fare - a commentary track, a few deleted scenes, and a behind the scenes featurette. They could have done better. The soundtrack is decent, but again, nothing to prompt a need to own; it has passable 2-channel and 5.1. The digital transfer is awesome though, and for me that more than makes up for the lackluster technical and special features.

There are a LOT of bad shark movies, even or especially from the Jaws franchise. But Deep Blue Sea somehow manages to swim above the rest. It's a good addition to a BD collection if you want to watch monster sharks outsmart the human cast.",1313366400,4,1579,4.491289198606272
1253209,4,B00002E23H,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***

A handsome transfer onto Blu Ray - and it has to be said - you notice it straight away too. But I must emphasize that 'DBS' looked great anyway for the vast majority of the time on my trusty old DVD. It's just that on BR you do notice the clarity far more.

And the audio...wow! It's huge. A packed 5.1 Soundtrack that is much improved over the DVD delivers a mighty surround-sound punch - especially when all hell breaks loose in the corridors of the flooding marine facility (which is often).

But the truth is that you'll be enjoying yourself too much to be looking out for any print difference. ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a hugely entertaining watch and a very satisfying thriller into the bargain. It mixes great set pieces with characters you route for - and even supplies its genetically modified toothsome frights with genuinely funny moments too. So when the gorgeous Saffron Burrows gets into the water at the end of the chase to lure Mister Big Nasty People-Munching Shark to her side for a chit-chat (dialogue above) - you'll be biting your nails to beat the band...and cancelling that snorkelling holiday...

To sum up - if you're a fan of ""Deep Blue Sea"" - then the Blu Ray of Renny Harlin's sharks-with-brains caper is definitely worth the upgrade. And even if you're coming to it for the first time, then you're in for a bit of a treat.

Reasonably priced and better than a slap across the kisser with a wet mackerel - treat yourself to this watery wonder film-lovers.
And stop feeding your goldfish spinach...ask Samuel L. Jackson...

1253211,4,B00002E23H,"This movie not that old, but where else can you get to see Samuel L Jackson eaten by a shark?
That given away, (I figured most know this fact) I say this movie action starts very early when some sharks attack a boat with kids. Then moves on to the story line and never stops. I think each actor brings a special mix of their character that's a step above most 2D characters In horror films today.
But alas one of the real tests was the Blu Ray copy and I didn't think It anything exceptional at all for a Blu Ray transfer. My regular DVD looks every so slightly as good as the Blu Ray when upconverted In the Blu Ray player. I had wonder If the Blu Ray was worth It. So my advice If you love the movie get In Blu Ray, If you just want own to watch the DVD should be fine even on widescreen. Hence 4 stars.",1309824000,2,805,3.9447852760736195

1253214,4,B00002E23H,"Released in the blu-ray format only a few months ago, 'Deep Blue Sea' is one of those films that highlight questions I have for this technology.  First, though, I'll say that I really enjoy what blu-ray does for certain types of film -- especially those with lush cinematography and vibrant natural scenes.  So in the end, I'm rooting for it, even if I wonder if it's appropriate for everyone -- or every film.

With 366 reviews, I don't think it's worth anyone's time to recap this movie.  I enjoyed it -- it's a fun, turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy-the-ride sort of flick, although if I spend too much time thinking about the film's internal logic afterward, it doesn't hang together as well as it does while I was actually experiencing it.  Regardless, if you haven't seen it before, and you are a horror/adventure fan, then I give it a strong recommendation.  Chances are, though, that you know about the film and may only be wondering whether to purchase it, or to upgrade from regular DVD to blu-ray.

'Deep Blue Sea' relies on three main things for it's effects -- actual footage of sharks, mechanical sharks and CGI sharks.  One thing I've noticed with HD and blu-ray is that CGI is more noticeable to me than before.  (This was especially clear after renting the abysmal remake of 'Pirahna' in HD.)  I know that some people do not like CGI-heavy films -- I would not consider 'Deep Blue Sea' CGI-heavy, but others might.  Still, this blu-ray version is only going to enhance the difference between real footage and that which is computer generated.  When I first saw this film several years ago, I don't remember noticing the CGI effects nearly as much as I did while watching this blu-ray transfer.  Since some of the most intense scenes are dependent on computer generated footage, I found this to be somewhat distracting.

Another question is whether or not to 'double-dip', or upgrade to blu if you already own the DVD.  Since I didn't have a regular edition of the film when I found this one on sale recently, the choice was easy for me.  But the blu-ray has no significant difference in the extras included, so the actual 'upgrade' may be small.  A good upscaling DVD player, or a blu-ray player playing a regular DVD of this film won't match the blu (which does have a beautiful picture), but they might be good enough -- at least good enough to skip double dipping.  Less definition may (or may not) also help disguise some of the CGI -- it probably depends on your experience at picking out computer generated footage.

Extras on this disc are rather limited: A trailer, two making-of featurettes, a couple of deleted scenes (available with or without commentary), and a feature film commentary by director Renny Harlin and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is obvious that Jackson and Harlin recorded their comments seperately, and they alternate for about half the movie, until Director Harlin takes over completely.  I thought this was one of the better commentaries I've listened to by people who were actually involved in the film.  (Most of the time I would just as well listen to commentary by film historians.)  Jackson's comments I could take or leave, but Harlin's were interesting, pointing out technical aspects and an inside view as to how some especially tricky shots were done.  I found it surprising how much more CGI there was than what I had picked up on, but what I enjoyed most were when he noted a couple of tributes to other films I had missed.  As a film buff, I appreciate these, and Mr. Harlin came across as a thoughtful filmmaker -- so much so that I will probably look for other films of his now.

According to the product details on the item page, the aspect ratio is listed at 1.77:1, which doesn't reflect what I saw.  On a 16x9 TV, 1.77:1 should fill up the entire screen, and it does not.  The blu-ray case lists the ratio as 2.4:1, which conforms to my experience; so even with a widescreen TV, there will still be black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.

Fun trivia:  The license plate Thomas Jane pulls out of the tiger shark's mouth in the beginning of the film is identical to the plate Richard Dreyfuss pulls out of the stomach of the shark in 'Jaws'.  Who says commentaries aren't useful?",1296950400,5,4241,4.65994623655914

Cool J in this film. Third, the main theme score was just down right creepy! There were a lot of creepy scenes that were enhanced by the music, one of which being the shaft scene. This movie was good, but it did have some drawbacks: Samuel L. Jackson and the ending. I won't give away the latter, but trust me, it sucked. As for Mr. Jackson, I never liked him much, and I think he's a horrible actor altogether.

1253224,5,B00002E23H,"the key to watching this movie is to understand its true nature. you might be tempted to watch this as a cautionary tale about the dangers of playing God, perhaps expecting Frankenstein, or Gattaca. you may also be tempted to watch this as a summer popcorn flick: big scary sharks, girl who must undress to kill said sharks, rapper/actor as shark fodder, etc. neither of these approaches is correct. you will be disappointed (thus, the various one-star reviews). you must watch this movie understanding that this is the GREATEST BAD MOVIE YOU WILL EVER WATCH. it's as if Ingmar Bergman undertook to make a porno, but decided to explore the bad qualities of the genre, instead of elevating it (like Spielberg has done for various genres). therefore, this movie is a careful meditation on really bad action films. it's ridiculous. but oh so well-crafted. there is whimsy. there is suspense. it is too clever to actually be this stupid. so you wink along and enjoy it. from the beginning it is perfectly pitched, pretending as if it were in fact a summer action movie. until Samuel L. Jackson's big scene. you know of what i speak. at that point, one is put on clear notice that this is not merely a by-the-numbers summer action movie. this is an absurd farce. but a really clever one. at that point, all bets are off. sharks move up, down, and backwards like fighter jets. helicopters are not safe from these things. the sharks actually have motivation. they are fighting for their freedom, like Che Guevera. Sharke Libre!! as for the poor humans, it is eminently obvious who will survive. but at the end, the film is like PSYCHE, B!T@H&5!! it is, at this juncture, also a pointed commentary about assuming the fate of the black guy. you ponder who the racist summer-shark-movie-watcher might be, and you look in the mirror and realize....it is I.",1240790400,2,1845,4.750778816199377

I don't consider Deep Blue Sea a classic, but its still a very good film.  It shouldnt be compared to Jaws because its really NOTHING like it other than having sharks in both movies.  Ive always enjoyed the films acting and its furious pace.  Its really an action packed thriller. Thats the best way to describe it. Deep Blue Seas special effects have been talked about ever since the film came out.  Of course, opinions vary on if the effects are good or bad.  I personally haven't seen a movie where the CGI stuff looked 110% real.  Nevertheless, I think the sharks look pretty cool.  Maybe not completely real, but they look really good.  I thought the effects as a whole were always awesome in this.  The effects are some the factors that make the film good but they aren't what make it great.  What makes this great is the pace and action scenes during the entire film.  It doesnt stop with the action, the whole film is like one huge ride.  Its pretty much nonstop.  Like I noted, the acting is good too.  The actors certainly did the best they could with what little dialogue they had.  Thomas Jane played his character very well and I loved his performance.  Ive seen the film numerous times and every single time Ive been entertained to the fullest.  Thats what its meant to be is entertaining, not a huge epic.  I loved this from the first viewing.

It tries so hard to scare you and has some very well done action that it most of the time rises above some plot holes and lapses in logic.

  In the middle of nowhere(of course) a research lab at sea is looking to find a cure for Alzheimer's and they are using shark's brains to test and get the cure.

Renny Harlin has directed some very nice, thrilling scenes.  The best scenes are when they use the machine-made sharks.  The graphics must have looked great in 99' but in 06' they don't hold up too well.  Still, I was scared.  I have a bad fear of Sharks and the Ocean(Jaws did not help) and this plays on that fear, when that shark was chasing LL Cool J I was on the edge of my seat.

The biggest problem in the movie is the effects.  When Samuel L got eaten I, at first jumped and then winced.  It looked below average, very below average.  Then again though, the scene in which Saffron is being stalked was great.  The acting is fine, LL and Samuel are the best of course, while Saffron Burrows is not far behind.

What I enjoyed the most about this film was the way the storyline constantly surprised me by taking one unexpected turn after another. Who will live and who will die?

1253237,2,B00002E23H,"You know, I used to like Renny Harlin's films when I was younger, but they really don't hold up, I've realized with my coming of age. I think he's a talented director capable of some genuinely biting action scenes ('Cliffhanger', 'Die Hard 2'), but overall his films are messy, and, if I'm to be scholarly in articulating the matter, stupid.

For me 'Deep Blue Sea' has a few things going for it. One -- the beautiful Saffron Burrows, who I might add can actually act, doing at least what she can with the generally bankrupt dialogue. Plus, there's a laughably contrived scene which requires her to get half-naked; given I didn't care about much by the time this gloriously sleazy moment appeared, I can't say I wasn't all for it. Then, there's the uncommonly merciless attitude of the film; none of the characters are given sympathy, and I find that admirable and devoid of manipulation. I mean, Sam Jackson's fate... Female leads being chomped to pieces. In a film comically unrealistic (which I don't judge too harshly, for it is made on the primary premise of SUPER INTELLIGENT SHARKS), the nature of the miserable situation is played out with a welcome, sensible set of results. Oh, and I'd say that LL Cool J is surely the peak of the film's performances; I hate the guy when he's in that ultra suave, dripping sweat, buldging, chocolate Casanova, but his role here is near the antithesis of that; a goofy, Bible quoting cook, with an obnoxious bird (I can't imagine who's brain this abominable idea came from) and a past alcohol problem.

And then there's Harlin, who, like I said, certainly has a knack for creating some of the most awesomely thrilling action scenes among Hollywood's finest directors of the genre. But, in 'Deep Blue Sea', sad to say, there are only a small handful. Also of some note is the score by Trevor Rabin, which covers moods from heroically cheesy to atmospheric and eerie. I think this is especially commendable for Rabin because, by and large, this is a horror/thriller (the former a bit of a stretch), requiring him to maintain a good deal more restraint than has ever been requested of the composer.

When it's all said and done though, it's just not very good. I can understand why people would enjoy it, because it is mindless and has some redeeming features spawning from that sense of recklessness -- and surely, I'm not against this particular mentality in a film -- but it's just a bit too stupid and apathetic for me to care. I got it used for a bargain, but I'm not sure it was really worth even that. And, while I'm by no means ashamed of its existence within my library, I'm pretty confident I'll never sit through the entire thing again.",1159574400,2,2687,4.652631578947369

1253239,1,B00002E23H,"Caution: This review contains a couple spoilers!

First off, I have to admit that my husband and I ended up seeing this by accident, when flipping through channels. What is not accidental (and is patently inexcusable, in my opinion) is the sheer awfulness of this movie. It was so bad it was funny, and for that reason alone we watched it for the (surely unintended) comedy.

The movie is rife with stock and unoriginal characters: whiny useless blonde woman, who can only stand there and scream at critical junctures (almost as vexing as those young women in horror flicks who are running for their lives but always trip and/or fall down), sexy young doctor/bimbo character (I guess she finished that pesky PhD while still in high school), buff blonde himbo (no, that's not a typo, he's just the male surfer version of the bimbo), and a couple of token minorities, one of whom gives preachy pep talks (we actually cheered when in the midst of Jackson's character's ""we must pull together as a team to survive"" rah-rah speech, a shark surfaced and gulped him down raw). Yummy. Mr. Shark doesn't fancy that sanctimonious claptrap anymore than we did.

Most amusing scene: bimbo scientist feels it necessary to strip off her wetsuit before she kills a shark, and after all the drama and suspense of the impromptu strip-tease we see she's wearing sensible white undies rather than Victoria's Secret. Aww, what a disappointment. But I guess good girls don't go to heaven if they wear naughty underwear.

More things we picked up on: whenever a character cusses, drinks, smokes, or looks at porn, something terrible happens. Evil shark suddenly appears and punishes said sinner. Hardly subtle. (For example, one guy lights up a cigarette and seconds later loses a hand - hubby said this was the best anti-smoking campaign ad ever!) There are probably more than a dozen references to God throughout this film, which in itself is not objectionable, but becomes obvious and annoying after more than a couple times. There's even a ""group hug"" scene where all the characters join hands in a circle and pray. What is this, the 700 Club? Not to mention a shark gets stabbed with a crucifix in the end. Spare us the lofty moral overtones and get on with the story already. Oh wait, that would require a plot, wouldn't it?

A lot of people have been comparing this movie to ""Jaws."" I'm not sure what they've been smoking (careful there, might lose a hand!;), but the only thing this joke of a film has in common with ""Jaws"" is the CGI effects might as well date from the 70s.

1253242,4,B00002E23H,"I am well aware of the flaws in this movie, but to truly appreciate it, you must understand its great strength. bear with me. First, so you know where my info comes from. I'm a diver, and when I was about 8 or 9 my oldest brother brought home a book on sharks which included a rather large appendix of recorded attacks. My love and fascination of sharks and the seas was born. Since then I got into diving and love photographing sharks which are truly beautiful and awesome in their own habitat. I have even worked with a few while volunteer diving for Marineland (The first marine aquarium in the world, the pioneer of the field, and one which has been brought to the brink of closing by places like Disney and Sea World but yet remains open). In the fourth or fifth grade I also took on mythology which includes oceanic civilizations who worshipped sharks as gods. Sorry for the longwindedness but I'm working my way to the point.

Jaws was an excellent story but written at a time when sharks were still very misunderstood. Even Benchley, in retrospect, regrets writing it because it gave sharks a bad name. Keep in mind that his expertise came from being involved with sharks and working on documentaries such as ""Blue Water, White Death"". Therefore, he knew how fictitious his story was, but never counted on people taking it for the gospel. Since that time it has been discovered that the vast majority of white shark attacks were not white sharks at all, but bull sharks. So the white shark has since lost a lot of its bad reputation to a shark that is worldwide and even comes to live in fresh water. Unfortunately, the general public doesn't follow these things but hopefully Discovery's ""Shark Week"" parades of info will eventually change that and even make people realize shark attacks are accidents and these movies are just fictitious stories. That was Jaws, now on to Deep Blue.

In recent years studies have been conducted on mako sharks which are the kind in the movie. The general belief about sharks is that they are brainless eating machines. True, most are likely outdone by most mammals alive, but not the mako. The mako is the PERFECT shark for such a work of fiction as Deep Blue. Why? Because they are the smartest of the sharks as it is. How smart is that? They likely learn more swiftly than your favorite dog. They can even set instinct aside as a choice made by thought. This may not sound so spectacular but it is a clear sign of intelligence, especially in a wild animal. It is in the wild that these studies were done. Now add their natural speed of up to approximately 60 MPH and their general fearlessness to the point of being known to attack boats. They have even jumped into boats for who knows what reasons.

Add these factors together, then multiply by four (makos are only about 10-12 feet long naturally) for the size differential. Now what do you have? A damned smart shark that fears nothing short of a ship (okay, maybe that's a bit extreme but you get the point), and has the speed and strength to cover distance in an instant and smash through most anything that isn't made especially strong and can swallow a person and barely notice.

Look up information on the extinct carcharadon megalodon if you'd like visual aid to imagine size. That shark had a tooth length of about 6-7 inches whereas a big white shark has teeth about 2-2 1/2 inches long. A shark the size of those in Deep Blue would even undoubtedly feed on killer whales. And most likely, nothing could contest its rule of the seas when full grown.

A final note to any reading this far. The movie ""Open Water"" is a rag. Whether you like the way it was filmed or not, the shark attack ending is nothing but a work of exploitation. They don't know what happened to them and threw sharks in because, quite frankly, sharks sell. And quite frankly, every dive boat I have been on has been either very efficient or very inefficient. I have yet to see one display efficiency like that in the movie, but not check role call again later. I'm not saying there aren't any like that, but I haven't seen any.

Sorry for rambling so long. I had many people ask me a lot about sharks after watching Deep Blue and appreciated it much better afterwards. So just thought I'd try and help to understand it.",1136073600,8,4295,4.521235521235521

Honestly, this isn't that great of a movie.  It has all of the action cliches, and the sci-fi try to play God and get screwed in the process plot.  Add some intelligent sharks to the mix and it's definitely a recipe for a B grade horror film.  But honestly, with the exception of the stellar Jaws, what shark movie isn't a B grade horror film?

What it does do is keep the tension going.  And there are some moments of shock and surprise in it.  I loved the ""we must pull together and not go quietly into the night"" speech that gets cut brutally short.  That was a genuinely fun scene because it was almost tongue in cheek.  In all action movies, you have this point where someone has to rouse the morale of the group and to have this individual torn in half midway through the speech is just a perfect nod to that.

The characters and the characterization of the shark were built to an incredible climax to rank with the greatest movie showdowns of all time. Forget about such artistry with this gore fest.

Aquatica is a research facility where a cure for Alzheimer's disease is attempting to be developed. However, along the way the sharks get really smart and decide they want to be free to roam the world's oceans and eat people at will. What follows is a relatively shallow monster movie with little to recommend it other than the digital special effects. The acting is shallow and the characters are stereotypical, including the gorgeous female needing to strip to her undies for some semi-plausible reason. The broadest character is LL Cool J, who plays a cook for comic relief. At least we understand his motivations are to be funny and survive to get back to dry land. Everyone else comes with monster movie baggage and we are just bored with their story, and probably care little about it anyway.

The real and only interest in this movie are the digital shark effects, which in a few places border on the cheesy and put what could have been a first class movie into a B-movie category.

1253254,3,B00002E23H,"DEEP BLUE SEA is an extremely silly film about scientists trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease by experimenting with the brain capacity of sharks (shark brains apparently never deteriorate as they age.)  Naturally, something goes wrong, and a handful of stock characters spend the rest of the film trying to escape a trio of super-predators that may actually be smarter than they are.

Everything is pure formula from start to finish, and the plot totally implausible, with lots of bad acting, but that doesn't mean it's not kind of fun anyway.  The action scenes are exciting, and the sharks - be they animatronics or computer generated - look 100% real.  The death scenes are well-done.  You aren't going to care about the characters; in fact you'll probably wish most of them would get offed.  However, there are some nice surprises regarding that.  I almost wish I'd seen it on the big screen; no doubt the impact is diminished on a standard TV.

The DVD is of high quality with a great picture and sounds great in surround.  It includes running commentary from director Renny Harlin and star Samuel L. Jackson.  There are also two featurettes: one on the making of the film and one on the making of the sharks in particular.  Deleted scenes, a trailer, and a stills gallery round out the extras.

The movie sports a pretty good cast, including Samuel L Jackson as a rich investor, and Saffron Burrows as the hard nosed and dedicated physician attempting to find a cure for Alzheimer's by using Shark brain fluid. Sounds cheesy, but the plot actually supports itself quite well and is at least plausible, if a little improbable. The story centers around an isolated marine facility with a skeleton crew that you just know are going to get into problems, and sure enough the picture moves quickly into an escape adventure, when the hunters (or scientists) become the hunted. Another complaint is the casting: the director seems to have felt the need to cover all the bases with stereotype characters, which really wasn't necessary.

* The aging and unkempt heavy smoking scientist

* The sexy young, ruthless bossy woman

* The religious guy

* The handsome hunky hero with a shady past

* The successful financial investor, who's also athletic and a born leader

* The soft spoken other female with an active but sensitive side

* The brainy guy who's a bit of a wimp, but comes through in a clutch

This is no Jaws however, with none of the grace or depth of the Spielberg classic, and spends far too much time trying to wow the audience with the ferociousness of the initially caged lab experiments. After they get loose we are treated to some gory attack scenes but this is where the movie really suffers. Watching this on the small screen really shows up the CGI and at times the sharks looks so fake, they almost appear as cartoons. Lightning fast attack sequences don't help this either, and the whole thing starts to look very artificial.

This isn't a BAD picture, and there are one or two twists in the plot, and scenes to make you jump which help lift the story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall.

Renny Harlin has delivered on all the goods right here in this B-movie that never tries to be more than what it is - a scary movie about killer sharks. DBS kicks the blubber out of ALL the Jaws sequels and it certainly eats up all the other direct-to-video shark attack movies. It can easily take second place on the shark movie list which is not a bad thing considering that Jaws is rated as one of the best movies ever out of all the genre types.
This is a great action flick with lots of stunning set pieces to boot. The whole film takes place on a deep-sea rig that is a marine institution for sharks that are being biologically altered to produce medicine. Then all hell breaks loose and the genetically modified sharks start eating everybody up. The end action sequence is mind-blowing and the special effects are top notch.
In short - if you are going to see a shark attack movie then watch Jaws, but if you want to see another then this is the one to get, hands down. The suspense is great and the film moves forward at quite a fast pace. There is never a dull moment to be had in DBS and you should all be thankful that someone had the courage to go out and make a competitive shark attack movie like this one (not to mention that Hollywood found a new leading action man in Thomas Jane.)

Except this one. Suprisingly this is a good moive...even though it is a direct take from JAWS. Still it delivers its fare share of truly frightening events and what not.
Scientists on a research base in the middle of the ocean are studying on how to make a shark more evolved or to see how its brain really works and it back fires and instead, they made the sharks smarter, and quite larger than normal sharks. It involves 3 and now everyone has to try and escape the large confinment. They cant call for help because a strom has interfered with all signals and the place is sinking fast when a rescue chopper crashes into the thing.
Very good even if it is a mirror image of greater movies. I highly reccommend JAWS to this but if you have seen JAWS and are interested in more shark movies, this is the next onthe recommendation list being that it is the 2nd best to any other out there.",1072656000,,1062,4.423469387755102

1253271,5,B00002E23H,"This film is increadible, mainly because it has no respect for it's cast. Anyone can die in this film. Someone who's the main character one minute is shark food the next. Although Renny Harlin took the 'special effects' option instead of building up real suspense, it works. There are some real shock moments in this film.
Basically it's Genetic Modification gone bazerk, super intelligent sharks, modified for the purpose of curing a disease, turn against their creators in a frenzy of snapping jaws and red-water scenes. I know, it's not the most in-depth plot review but that's it really, which doesn't matter because the great content makes up for the barely existant story.
The cast is great. Saffron Burrows shows that she is more than just cleavage as the meddling scientist who went too far, while Thomas Jane succeeds as the action hero (Even though he falls down about 50 times) and LL Cool J is surprisingly good as the comic relief/chef. Although he's playing the token 'cowardly character' Michael Rapaport gives a good performance, Stellan Skarsgard and Samuel L Jackson are both very talented actors who are good in any film and Jacqueline McKenzie gives more than just a creadible performance, watch the deleted scenes to see her at her best.
I would reccommend this film to anyone who likes a high tension thriller with plenty or guts'n'gore, but it belongs in anyone's DVD collection. It's in mine ;).

1253272,5,B00002E23H,"Simply put, deep blue sea is the best shark film in my opinion that I have ever seen, it is even better than Jaws. Great special
effects, shocks and good acting.",1062633600,2,161,4.225806451612903
1253273,2,B00002E23H,"Deep Blue Sea had a monument of potential and they dropped the ball by becoming over-engrossed with shark attacks and sudden deaths of likeable characters, and unrealistc parts.  It's too bad, because I thought the sharks were cool in this, and Saffron Burrows was a joy to see because I thought her character came a long way up until the director makes a real bone head mistake in the end with her.
Deep Blue Sea is about super smart sharks that are being used to find a cure for Alzheimers.  Saffron's character is motivated to find a cure from these sharks because she lost her father to it.  This is good, gives her character an emotional connection to this film, a point for this pretty lady to be here.  As predictable as night will come, the sharks get loose and start eating everybody in the study facility.
I really don't see the point going over the characters that much because the majority of the characters had no development at all.  It's interesting how this film begins with Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson as the lead characters, the film practically following those two around.  About mid way through the film, the point of view shifts almost entirely to the shark trainer guy, Carter, and we know nothing about this dude.  This is just terrible directing and character view point.  So now, we have no idea who the main character is!
Then the sudden death of one of these main characters, mid way through, during a lengthy speech just ruins the film.  It's too sudden, and because his character was taken so early it was as if his character never contributed to the film at all...except for the speech.  Before a character, a main character mind you, should be killed off he/she needs to contribute first so when the person dies it doesn't make us say...""OK, um, what happened?""  In other words, it just confuses us not scares us.
Plus, my favorite character in Saffron, who is developing during this entire film gets the shaft in the end.  This is totally uncalled for.  I wish I could go into more detail but I've been instructed not to give away important, specific things.  But it is very disappointing and very unnecessary, but again this director real had no idea of the potential he had because he was too obsessed with the sharks.
There's too much sudden shark attacks.  All these worthless characters have no point to the film, they are just there for future shark bait.  You need characters to contribute to a film, to have a point.  They shouldn't be there to fulfill the director's surge for carnage.
I give it two stars because it is suspenseful and it can be scarey at some points, and I do like the story, even though no character establishes him or herself as the main character.  So because it does these things well enough, I give it two stars which means it is worth watching, but I assure you this film is not very satisfactory.  It kills off too many well liked characters.
The only reason why you would like this film is if you are one of those that likes any film that scares you or provides thrills.  But if you want substance, and character development that isn't cut short by a shark's jaws, then you better go see Jaws again because it is still the king of sea horror films.
Grade: D+",1062201600,,3235,4.544827586206897
1253274,2,B00002E23H,"I'm being quite honest when I say I truly wanted to like Deep Blue Sea. I went into the film with some fairly high expectations of pure summer action/suspense entertainment because of the mostly positive response it was getting from critics. Plus, it's been a long time since we've had a fun shark movie so I was ready to embrace this with open arms.
Alas, it was not to happen, and I should have known. After all, even though Renny Harlin can prove himself skillful in directing action sequences, he fails to inject genuine suspense and often goes too far over-the-top in a movie that mostly takes itself seriously. This is not Lake Placid (which is quite a good thing). Deep Blue Sea isn't terrible by a long shot, but it's not the breakneck paced thriller I was hoping for.
Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) is in the process of creating a cure for Alzheimer's Disease. With the help of a crew working in an underwater habitat, they use the brain material of sharks to get this job accomplished. However, the side effect was that the sharks (3 of them) grew smarter as a result of the experimentation, and they break loose, creating hell as they begin to prey on the group of survivors, who are trying to find a way to get topside.
Deep Blue Sea is a movie that should have been dripping with suspense and action from every corner. Instead, what we get is the occasional ""jump-in-your-seat"" shark attack that only offers momentary jolts. Oh, don't get me wrong, there are some exciting moments, but not enough to cover the entire running time of 105 or so minutes.
This is director Renny Harlin we're talking about, who's made almost nothing but big-budget duds (Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2). Considering the fact that Deep Blue Sea may very well be his best movie only goes to show he isn't that accomplished a director. He's all about the action, and there are moments in Deep Blue Sea when it works. L.L. Cool J.'s encounters with the sharks are often tense and surprisingly humorous, and there is a flooding scene with the characters trying to escape the sharks by climbing a ladder that remains a fairly memorable setpiece
However, there are plenty of moments that don't work, either. One of the ""main characters"" sudden departure feels quite obvious in the middle of his ""we will survive if we stay together"" speech, and the end result is not only bloody, but also quite cheesy. The over-the-top finale is probably the worst, and the less description about it, the better.
The special effects are sometimes effective, just like the action scenes (as I think of it now, a lot of things are sometimes effective and sometimes not). The animatronic sharks are convincing and realistic, but CGI is far worse-looking than what you may have thought was dated in Jaws. The sets are appropriately well-fashioned, and the constant scenes of flooding do give the film a little added tension.
The performances are also a mixed bag. Samuel L. Jackson as the man funding the whole operation is very good (as always) and it's a pity he isn't in this film more. As I think of it, as soon as his presence is gone, that's when the film's true downslide began. Saffron Burrows is also good as the scientist and heroine of the picture, but a stupid move on the filmmakers' part in the finale ruins any of her development (which isn't a whole lot to begin with, but is significantly more than anyone else). Also decent are Stellen Skarsgard and Jacqueline Mckenzie. LL Cool J is fun to watch when he's making fun of his situation, but is a bit irritating when he's preaching (he plays a religious cook, is this a case of miscasting?).
The two performers that are not so good are Michael Rappaport and Thomas Jane. Rappaport often goes so far over-the-top in his role you have to wonder who he thinks he's chewing the scenery from. Now, as for Thomas Jane as the shark wrangler, did this guy graduate from the school of acting from Christopher Lambert? For that matter, the two of them look so alike I was wondering if they were related. But back to his performance; Jane is so wooden it's almost laughable. There's even a moment when he pops out of the water and starts screaming in such an unconvincing manner, I found myself chuckling. Jane is perhaps the worst thing about this film and he actually gets the second-most amount of screentime!
The script is dumb, no doubt about it, with some cringe-inducing dialogue and laughably bad science. But, to give all involved in the film credit, everybody seems to know that and doesn't take the story too seriously, which is actually a good balance. If it had reached the campy levels of Lake Placid, this would have been a disaster so points must be awarded to the fact that the tone does usually maintain the same, that is until the over-the-top finale.
There are also some other points in the film that hurt it. Trevor Rabin's score is a little overwrought and fails to bring about the needed excitement. There's also a scene that almost plays an ode to Alien, in which Burrows strips down to her underwear to electrocute a shark. Sure, Burrows is a very good-looking woman, but it's a gratuitous moment.
No one ever said Deep Blue Sea had to be masterful, but it's often too goofy, and thus prevents it from being the extremely entertaining action/thriller it could and should have been. What we do get is still quite watchable and does offer some entertainment, but a quick fix isn't satisfying enough.

1253276,4,B00002E23H,"""Deep Blue Sea"" is one of those monster flicks that makes an attempt at being an intelligent man's horror film.  The genetically-altered, Alzheimer cure-all mako shark idea was a good one, and a little more unique than most creature films, but in essence this is a man-screws-with-nature-nature-screws-back sort of tale.  There are a couple of suspenseful moments, and the makos look great throughout the majority of the film.  Other reviewers accuse the acting as being standard and weightless, but remember that this is a creature feature and the first rule of this genre is that the creature is the star.  I found nothing terribly wrong about the acting, and much like ""Anaconda,"" this film has a token rapper(LL Cool J) who does a good job.  The rest of the cast is fairly standard, but none of their performances are that bad.  Samuel L. Jackson gives ""Deep Blue Sea"" a solid actor, and he seemed to enjoy his time on screen in this film.  Thomas Jane is another standout who plays the heroic lead, although little is left for our hero to save.  Saffron Burrows does an excellent job as the good-meaning, yet slightly mad scientist who you really want to see get bit by a mako.
Overall, this is an above-average flick.  It isn't as cheesy as ""Lake Placid,"" and it doesn't make the sharks quite as smart as the raptors of ""Jurassic Park"" fame, but it takes parts of both of these films and combines them with a little suspense and terror a la ""Jaws"" and serves up a fish dinner that just about anyone can enjoy.
Also, notice the nod given to ""Jaws"" during Jackson's initial landing at Aquatica.(Hint:  Check that license plate)",1058745600,44,1631,4.6912280701754385
1253277,3,B00002E23H,"Director Renny Harlin is best known for his action flicks like Die Hard 2 and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  In Deep Blue Sea he combines his trademark action with horror.  Centered on genetically enhanced sharks, it's tempting to compare it to Jaws.  Indeed, the opening scene pays homage to the classic shark flick, but that is where the similarity ends.  Actually, DBS reminds me more of a Michael Crichton movie with its science gone bad storyline.  The story takes place on a research laboratory in the middle of the ocean.  Researchers are using the brains of live sharks to harvest a protein that is a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease.  In order to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein, the lead scientist genetically enhances the shark brains to increase their size.  This has the effect of making the sharks ""smart"".  The result is sharks that will do anything to escape captivity.
The action starts early and never lets up.  Stranded in the lower levels, the station survivors are picked off one by one as they try to make their way to the surface.  Harlin provides ample ""sudden"" attacks by the sharks to provide several shocking moments.  Notable cast members include LL Cool J, Samual L. Jackson, and Michael Rapaport.  Model Saffron Burrows takes on the ""Sigourney Weaver"" heroin role.  Deep Blue Sea benefits from the advances in FX since the Days of Jaws.  A combination of CGI and animatronics are used to provide convincing sharks.
The disc has some nice extras including a making of documentary, deleted scenes, and commentary from Renny Harlin and S.L. Jackson.  The picture is presented nicely in widescreen format.  There are quite a few loud noises to give your surround system a workout and it comes across well in Dolby 5.1.  If you own Jaws, this movie makes a nice companion piece.

1253278,4,B00002E23H,"This is a fun shark film.  It does not have the suspense levels of Jaws (mostly because we can see the sharks more often) but it certainly has its moments.
A major firm is funding a research facility studying sharks to find a cure for Alzheimers and other degenerative brain diseases.  The plug is going to be pulled from the facility as one of their sharks had escaped and caused some scares before being recaptured.
But with 48 hours, positive results may be had.  The result is that Samuel Jackson travels to the facility between shifts (read that as smaller cast) to witness a test.
A ""protein complex' is taken from the brain of one of the test sharks and it does, indeed, reanimate inactive brain tissue.  But then the test shark wakes up, chomps an arm and is released back into the pens.
Scientist sans arm must be evacuated while a hurricane batters the facility.  Guess what happens.  The rescue is botched, the facility is breach and blows up, and the two smaller sharks can now swim through the flooded corridors.
The main characters try to avoid flood waters and killer sharks as they try to find a way back to the surface.  But then we learn that the sharks were genetically manipulated to give them bigger brains.  It also made them smarter.
Although the station is flooding, it is not the best environment for sharks so the cast are able to fight back to a degree that would not be possible in the open ocean.
Tense moments abound until the film's end when the survivors she the next shift arriving by boat.
One thing that sets this movie apart from other shark movies (except Jaws) is that the sharks are physically real.  Two huge animatronic sharks were built that could swim and act like any other shark.  CGI was only briefly used in two short spots to minimize danger to the actors from an 8000 pound robot.  The result is some nasty looking sharks.
One of the better shark films around.  The DVD has some commentary, five deleted scenes (only one of which could have added to the final film) and a documentary about how the sharks were built.",1055116800,2,2065,4.536388140161725
1253289,4,B00002E23H,"About a half-hour into watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" I gave up on asking myself what the hell the people who made this movie were thinking.  Then there is a scene where Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), who once survived an avalanche, gives an inspiration speech to everybody still alive at that point in the movie.  His words are punctuated in such a way that I knew we were not in Kansas any more and decided not to question anything that happened in the rest of the film.  This proved to be a wise decision because what director Renny Harlin has created here is not so much a movie as an amusement park ride.
The explanation for what Harlin was thinking is provided on the special features, where it becomes clear the director wanted to make a movie where he could use modern animatronics and computer generated effects to show graphic shark attacks.  The idea was to play with bigger and better toys than Steven Spielberg had when he made ""Jaws.""  Of course, doing so sacrifices the cinematic artistry of Spielberg's film, but that is fine because Harlin is not playing in that ballpark.
There is a plot to the film.  Scientist Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) has come up with a way of using the brain tissue of sharks to concoct a way of fighting Alzheimer's disease.  The research is underwritten by Franklin's corporation at a giant deep-sea research station, where we have a shark wrangler (Thomas Jane), a cook who is a self-styled preacher (LL Cool J), and an assortment of entree items in the form of Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, Aida Turturro, and Jacqueline McKenzie.
But all that matters is that McAlester is playing Dr. Frankenstein and in making the brains of these sharks bigger, she has also made them smarter.  Her motives for doing so are quickly forgotten because these super smart sharks want to kill every human being in the station and that is what this movie is about.  I bet you can guess who is actually going to survive the slaughter, but that does not detract from the enjoyment of the film either because the fun with ""Deep Blue Sea"" is enjoying, if that would be the proper world, the way in which the sharks put the bite on the humans.
So, if you know going into this movie that it is about a bunch of super intelligent mako sharks eating a bunch of human beings, then you can dismiss all of the scientific explanations and exposition as just prologue.  You do not have to understand it and you can probably get away with even paying attention to it, because once the shark attacks begin that is all that is going to matter with this film.

1253307,4,B00002E23H,"Ok, what we have here is one of those underestimated action films. Yes, it has sharks in it but that doesn't make it comparable to Jaws. Jaws and Deep Blue Sea are quite different films, simply because the approach is different. Deep Blue Sea is about a group of scientists who work in a submarine research lab known as Aquatica, somewhere near the Mexico coast. Aquatica is usually filled with people, but during the weekends it is shut down. Not this weekend, though. The head scientists are in a hurry and they need to complete their most important experiement, which is to get a cure for Alzheimer and they claim they can get it from a protein that exists only in the brain of white sharks.
So we stay with the skeleton crew only: the founder of the project (Samuel L. Jackson), the chief scientist (Saffron Burrows), the tough ex-con turned into the guy who feeds and takes care of the sharks (Thomas Jane), the wise neurologist (Stellan Skarsgard), the systems engineer (Michael Rapaport), the radio woman (Aida Turturro), the executive officer nurse (Jacqueline McKenzie) and the cook (LL Cool J). They work hard all Friday to get their sharks ready for testing on Saturday night. We're talking about genetically engineered sharks, giant sharks with bigger brains so the scientists can get a larger amount of the protein they need. But they don't count on the sharks getting more intelligent than they expected. And the sharks are not interested on helping out the scientists, what they want is to get free, to get out of the cages they keep them in and escape into the deep blue sea. So in a really freaky accident, the sharks get loose, they get out of their cages and swim around the flooded Aquatica. And while the whole lab is sinking, the skeleton crew has less and less space to move and what's worse, the sharks take over more and more territory.
These guys need a way out, but not all of them are going to make it and even if they do make it, they also need to kill the sharks before they can escape and reproduce. Now you're in for a gory adventure, and if that's your thing, you sure are going to love this movie. All actors are great in their roles, especially watch out for Rapaport as the nerdy tech guy and Thomas Jane as the ex-con. I know Renny Harlin is the responsible for some lousy movies (Cutthroat Island, Long Kiss Goodnight) but he has been involved in great action movies as well, such as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger.

some scenes of the sharks are computer generated, but some of the scenes aren't. they actually built an entire shark that could swim and move on it's own. pretty cool.
awsome movie, great surprises, and awsome death scenes. tons of blood, people getting bitten in half, just awsome.
and then to top that off, LL Cool J's awsome theme song comes out in the end...""My hat is like a shark's fin.""
only problem with Deep Blue Sea is the ending, which is a total rip off from the 1st Jaws. but other than that, great movie.
awsome movie.",1034208000,,1605,4.557093425605537

This isn't your average Jaws movie. There ain't no  music to tell you when it's coming! It  just comes!  and yes there are  times when you'll jump  in your seat. This movie is full of irony. There are many surprises. One major surprise, LL cool J makes it! Can you believe it! Finally  we are not the first to get messed up on screen. Yeah baby. You gotta see this movie.

1253311,1,B00002E23H,"Go see the first Jaws movie if you like sharks.  But if you want to buy this movie, let us list the pros and cons of this film...
Pro: Some humor (from L.L. Cool J and his bird)and a almost believable reason to carry out research on the sharks' minds.
There was also a very shocking scene (with Jackson) that totally surprised me.  It was the only one to surprise me.
Cons: Bad FX.  I saw this on the big-screen and the sharks looked totally fake. And you saw them too many times, which just proved again and again how fake they looked.  Also the sharks' were able to do things no shark could do no matter how smart, like swim BACKWARDS.  And why Marko sharks?  We're talking about one of the fastest and MOST aggressive sharks in nature!  Great Whites would of been safer AND have large brains to begin with because of their size (for research purposes).
Also the computer generated FX was used way too much even when not showing the sharks.  Like a ripple in the water to suggest sharks moving under the water, WHICH ALSO LOOKED FAKE.
JAWS, in where our own fear was used to see the damn shark everywhere, plus great music, was ten times better.
Don't watch Deep Blue Sea unless you plan to use it for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 party night OR want to cheer on the sharks!",1030752000,,1278,4.317991631799163

It was a great idea for an escapist B-movie, and the build-up to each attack was serviceable - but the absolutely laughably ludicrous CGI effects made the sharks as non-scary as humanly imaginable. They killed the ""mood"" each time. Director Harlin erred when he decided to show full-length shark acrobatics and attacks. They came off as cheapo 3D cartoons with cheapo cartoon legs flailing in their mouths. Learn from the horror masters, Renny - Less is more! A few scale shark models, foaming red water, split-second closeups, and ominous music would have been better.
Spotting the 'Jaws' and 'Alien' series homages ... was the only entertaining factor after a while. Well, that and Saffron Burrows' flawless face...",1029715200,,748,5.139344262295082

1253314,3,B00002E23H,"Of all the movies that Renny Harlin has directed, this one [stinks] the least.  I hope Harlin realizes that that is a compliment.
If Spielberg had 1999's digital technology at his fingertips when making JAWS in 1974-75, then JAWS probably would not have been anywhere near as good as it is.  Speilberg would have shown way too much of the shark, and way too soon in the film, as was his original plan anyway before it went awry thanks to the constantly malfunctioning mechanical albatross of a shark (three of them, actually) he had to work with.
  With DEEP BLUE SEA, Harlin is so gung-ho on letting us see what mechanical marvels his fake sharks are and what digital tricks he can pull, he forgot the less-is-more rule.  And as with every other Harlin film, the directing is clunky, forced, and obvious.  There is very little style or grace to it.  The genetically enhanced mako sharks in his movie could have been made to be more terrifying than anything seen in JAWS, but instead he endows them with a cartoonish physicality.
A better director (and one who might not come off as being so high on himself in the accompanying audio commentary) could have made DEEP BLUE SEA a decent balance of thrill-ride and haunted house scare, all rooted in a sufficient amount of plausibility.  Harlin, however, directs his movies like a kid wielding a very expensive Hollywood magic wand.  His films are like a series of expensive set-pieces strung together with nary a thought for the intelligence of the audience or for even the thinnest sense of reality his audience must buy into to be completely sold on the film's concept.
But DEEP BLUE SEA is about as good a movie as Renny Harlin will ever make.  But the raw materials of this film most certainly would have been assembled much more effectively by a more accomplished and talented director.",1023494400,2,1839,4.700934579439252

1253335,3,B00002E23H,"...The result is Deep Blue Sea. Surprisingly, the result is a dandy horror film. It is no classic, but it has chills and thrills to spare. At least this was my experience, and I am all that afraid of sharks.
The story is much different, but the villain is the same. Actually, we have four to-die-for sharks here. Samuel L. Jackson plays a billionaire whose company is underwriting scientific research in which some chemicals in shark brains are being used to find a cure for Alzheimer's. When Dr. Susan McAlister [Saffron Burrows] is told that the project is to be canceled due to poor results, she begs her benefactor to give her just two or three more days. Off they fly to the research site, which is a sort of huge floating fish tank off the coast of California. It is the weekend, and only a skeleton staff is on hand. They are the typical band of nutty geniuses found in such movies.
The first twenty minutes or so seem to be intentionally set up to make this seem like an ordinary thriller. I think director Rennie Harlan wanted to lull the audience into thinking there would be few surprises. Things change fast when an ugly secret comes out. In order to move the project along, the head of the project has genetically modified the sharks' brains. Now they are super intelligent. This little scientific nudge soon proves to be a complete disaster. These creatures naturally want out of their prison, and they've got a plan.
Deep Blue Sea works for several reasons. The plot is absurd, but it is not so idiotic that you roll your eyes over it. The actors are uniformly good, much like the casts of my all time favorite horror movies, Alien and Aliens. Model-turned-actress Saffron Burrows is convincing as Dr. McAlister, whose pride makes it hard for her to admit that her work has been a big mistake. Thomas Jane has a great time playing Carter Blake, an ex-con who turns out to be an unlikely hero. LL Cool J, always fun to watch, is Preacher, the film's comic relief.
Deep Blue Sea remembers that one of the basic elements of a horror story is isolation. The characters find themselves marooned on a dreadful oceanic vessel in the middle of a tropical storm, while the sharks tear away at the structure, causing it to start sinking. Meanwhile, jolting music by Trevor Rabin plays at full blast.
Most of the sharks are either animatronic or computer generated, but they look frightfully real. With the exception of [a previous movie] years ago, most movies that take place mostly underwater have not worked. Deep Blue Sea is an exception. Whether it's to save themselves or to try to kill the sharks, the crew must go in the water a lot. In the murky sea or around any water-filled part of the vessel, a forty-foot long - and very upset - eating machine is apt to appear.
If Jaws kept you away from the beach for twenty years, do not even think about seeing this movie. If not, you will enjoy this fast, creepy and almost intelligent shark feast.",1016668800,2,2955,4.5668549905838045
1253336,2,B00002E23H,"Each year Hollywood offers us a handful of intended blockbuster flicks to attract the masses. In 2000 we had The Mummy, The Haunting, Deep Blue Sea (to name a few) and this year we have Windtalkers, Men In Black 2 and of course, Austin Powers 3.
All these films have two dimensional characters, big stars and big effects. They don't want to intrigue us and we don't ask them to. So it comes as no surprise that Deep Blue Sea is another STUPID, big effects, big explosions, big death count film. But it isn't that bad. We get the contrived laughs from the token African American, we have the beautiful lady who verges on titillation and of course have the enemy, who this time is a bunch of [angry]sharks whose brains have been tampered with too many times.
Renny Harlin masterly handles his action sequences but at times it becomes so ridiculous you can't help but ask `What next?'. The script is bad, the acting holds on and the explosions are big. It's just a shame that the ending was so anti-climatic. Which is the major flaw. You don't want to spend ninety minutes watching something this stupid and not be rewarded. Jurassic Park overwhelmed us, Speed left us on a high (no pun intended) but Deep Blue Sea simply left us.
People who called this rubbish missed the point and people who called it a masterpiece, well, I feel sorry for you.
So watch it if you really want to, and I ensure some unpredictable moments, but as usual another effects laden film will leave you deflated.

1253337,4,B00002E23H,"First off I love shark films, in a word: Jaws.  But this film is something different.  The science behind the sharks and how they move and what these scientists did to them is mind bending.  Plus they actually built three huge friggin' sharks to make this film believable.
So what you got is a bunch of scientist and Sam Jackson (yes he is in this movie as well as a host of others) doing experiments on sharks to help cure a disease, but oops the scientists screwed with sharks and they became smart *evil laugh*.  Then sharks do the nasty on there makers and thus equals deep blue sea.
As you can tell the plot is a bit murky, but the acting is pretty good and the sharks look great although some of the special effects on these sharky's looks pathetic at times.  But still I found the flick to be pretty enjoyable to watch, and Thomas Jane (the main hero) does a good job as the tough Wolverine wannabee shark wrangler.  Plus its got Sam Jackson the baddest M-Fer in movies today, by the way that is self proclaimed by Jackson himself.
Also the DVD has some awesome extras, deleted scenes and lots of other goodies to check out.
Closing thoughts:  If you like shark films and good acting this is a good film to go out and buy, I really enjoyed it.  But it does get a bit hokey at parts and you'll be saying ""What the hell was that?""  But still its worth at least renting first, that is if you don't like sharks.  Still has lots of great action and carnage for the typical movie lover.

1253348,3,B00002E23H,"When the final credits role on some movies, you become a different person. Other films may not change you, but they at least make you think. Most movies are neither of the above, are made for pure entertainment, and are garbage. However, some pure entertainment flicks aren't all that bad.  These are the mind candy films. DEEP BLUE SEA is such a film.
Like most suspense films, there is a lot of gore, some foul language, and a few useless scenes. Nevertheless, the plot is more believable than most suspense/action adventure films. However, none of that is important. There are three reasons to see DEEP BLUE SEA.
First, the sharks. JAWS is a far superior film. However, the sharks in that first blockbuster aren't all that real looking. In DEEP BLUE SEA, the sharks are more real and are anatomically correct.
Second, Samuel L. Jackson. His talent and prescence can make even the most worthless film somewhat watchable.
Finally, this is the first film of its type I have seen where the religious guy (Preacher) survives. Sure, Preacher has flaws; we all do. But his faith is real. Usually Hollywood kills off the religious person ASAP or makes them into a cowardly fool or unlikeable character that the audience wants to see killed. Not so in this film.

1253352,2,B00002E23H,"For as long as one can remember, the horror genre has been the least respected in the world of film. Maybe it's because of the tilt to campy black humor the genre has taken for the past two decades. Or, perhaps, because of the formulaic manner in which the cast members can either be predictably the first ones to be killed off by whatever manner of menace, or seen to be the ones that have what it takes to survive. ""Deep Blue Sea"" manages to stave off expectations on who the victims will be, but the lack of a plot line and extraordinarily bad special effects eventually sink the movie's aims.
British actress Saffron Burrows plays Dr. Susan McAlester, a bio-engineering ingenue who convinces her superiors at her research firm to give her one more chance to perfect a vaccine that will cure Alzheimer's Disease, using mako sharks as the test subjects. She is granted her wish to continue, but is to be watched by executive Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson, the only name of note in this mostly cast of unknowns). There is one catch: The sharks have been given artificially larger brains by Dr. McAlester, making them harder-thinkin', harder-runnin', higher-killin' machines.
Dr. McAlester arrives onto the mid-ocean research facility with Franklin to run the ultimate test: using one of the test makos' brain fluid against a strain of Alzheimer's. Predictably, though, there's trouble on the horizon in the shape of a large storm approaching the facility. After the test is proven successful, the test shark manages to sever the arm of a lab assistant. The facility's crew (led by Carter, played by Thomas Jane) are all finding their life's work going downhill after that, when a rescue chopper gets dragged by a shark into the facility's surface area via a steel rope used to take the injured man up, and hampers the attempts by the others to get to the research area's surface, and finding opportunities for possible rescue. But the rogue test shark, and its two equally fierce companions, stand in the way.
The main problem with the film, as a whole, lies with the sharks themselves. They are almost exclusively computer generated, and look very much like that. It has none of the panache of ""Jaws""' electronic shark. The makos roam with incredible speed, munching away at human flesh at almost every turn of the movie, a seemingly ethereal sight. Also, we know the sharks are smart; but their advancement (recognizing the threat of a gun in their snouts, violently smashing out surveillance cameras, dragging a rescue copter into a building, setting off a chain of explosions throughout all levels of the research building) defies all logic! In the end, the implausibility of the sharks' behavior dooms whatever intentions the movie had to be a ""thinking person's horror flick.""
The rapper L.L. Cool J. makes an appearance as the research facility's cook. It is amazing to watch him playing a character who at once spouts Scripture (thereby attaining the nickname ""Preacher"") and profanities, almost in the same breath. Such inanities do little to endear his character to the audience. The other characters are even less human than the sharks, showing little remorse for their more unfortunate compadres who are victimized by the scaly carnivores. In fact, the moral relativism displayed by the characters take much away from their humanity, thereby dimming the sympathies of any audience with heartbeats for these protagonists.
It is, after all, just a horror film...one that just manages to stay away from all formulas. This is perhaps ""Deep Blue Sea""'s only claim to fame, and only redemptive quality. If the film were a shark, it would be a lemon.",1004918400,,3662,4.93679092382496

The special effects and action, while sometimes spectacular really don't manage to save what is otherwise a dog of a film that was hyped as a kind of Jaws on steroids.  Occasional snappy one-liners don't manage to make up for otherwise poor dialog, either.  A formula plot can also be used as a framework from which to hang a moral message of some kind, but the discussion of the ethics of research toward a cure for Alzheimer's, which could have given us some pleasantly deep ""do the ends justify the means"" arguments, seems to disappear once we're waiting to see who will die next in some horrific fashion.

1253369,4,B00002E23H,"""Deep Blue Sea"" is a thriller about mako sharks whose brains have been genetically altered by a research team at a research facility in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The experiment soon backfires, and our man-hungry sharks are soon chasing the remaining survivors through flooded caverns and tanks.
The shark concept is hardly original, but one can hardly dismiss Renny Harlin's latest film as a ""Jaws"" clone. The setup for the action is different, original in its ideas but not in the message it sends us. The film is nothing more or less than a thrill machine, with lots of explosions and shark attacks to spare, but it's surprisingly entertaining, and has its share of enjoyable moments.
The movie begins with a shark attack that ends with no one killed or injured, though the accident causes some negative attention and trouble for Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows), who runs the research lab Aquatica. Her project involves the extracting of a genetically developed protein complex in the brains of mako sharks, in hopes that they will provide a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Her funds come from Russell Franklin, whose skepticism concerning the project results in his returning with Susan to the lab to oversee the experiment.
Of course, Aquatica is not your everyday research lab. Once a navy refueling station, the facility was converted into a research laboratory, complete with shark pens and an underwater lab where observation of the sharks takes place. Introducing us to various characters that will bite the bullet sooner or later, the film is quick to let go of some baggage before things get out of hand.
The experiment proves to be a success, but a shark attack leads to a rescue helicopter accident, causing lots of explosions and flooding various chambers and levels of the facility. With no way to call for help, the remaining survivors must try to find their way out of the water before the sharks reach them.
The movie sets up the terror by using a universal message popular in many of today's creature features: don't tamper with Mother Nature. Susan has genetically tampered with the brain size of the sharks as a way to harvest more proteins, though the side effect is a much smarter animal with a heightened taste for blood and freedom. Though this is not the first film to use this kind of message (we've seen it done in films like ""Mimic"" and the Jurassic Park films), it works to its advantage.
And the action, once it starts, doesn't stop, and is made unique by director Harlin's sense of the unknown. Any other director, and the movie would suffer from severe predictability, but Harlin infuses the story with the same suspense he did in ""Cliffhanger,"" and those who we think would be the last to die end up being the first ones to go. Did you really expect Samuel L. Jackson to go so quickly?
Certain scenes are very intense, creating some involving action set pieces that are very effective. The initial destruction of the facility begins with a man losing his arm and ends with the underwater observation lab being flooded as our survivors rush to escape. Another scene pits Preacher (LL Cool J) against a shark and a rapidly heating oven, ending in a spectacular explosion from which he escapes. When the climax arrives, it becomes easier to guess who will be left standing, but it's still tons of fun, nonetheless.
Some very entertaining performances are turned in here. Thomas Jane plays hero-for-the-day Carter Blake very effectively, and we believe in his physical drive and strength as much we do the scientific knowledge of Saffron Burrows in the role of Susan. Samuel L. Jackson, while he lasts, plays a part out of his norm, but he does it well. LL Cool J is a riot as the unconventional priest, and Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, and Jacqueline McKenzie also make appearances.
In a season of uninvolving thrillers like ""End of Days,"" ""Deep Blue Sea"" floats to success with some very effective action sequences and some good performances. Renny Harlin revisits the tactics used in his previous films, and puts them to good use here. It's not on par with ""Jaws,"" but as a film in which the race against time winds down tightly, it works.",996537600,,4191,4.822222222222222
1253370,1,B00002E23H,"Many have already knocked Deep Blue Sea for being unrealistic, so I won't focus on that here. We're going to assume that it is entirely logical that scientists would use sharks to cure Alzheimer's.
I have two major problems with Deep Blue Sea. 1) The shark effects are incredibly bad, and 2) Renny Harlin. If the shark effects had been sweet, I might be more forgiving... but they aren't, so I won't.
My main problem with the effects is that the sharks actually change size, or ""mass"". I don't think this effect is intended, as the phenomenon is never addressed by the characters. There are several instances where I thought the human cast would be safe having just entered a small corridor or passed through a small doorway... ""just when you thought it was safe to depend on the laws of physical matter!"" Yep, here come the sharks. On the other hand, the plot also didn't address the fact that the sharks MIGHT have built some quantum space-altering machine when they weren't eating people.
I'll leave my effects quibbles at that and move on to the other major element that holds this movie back: Renny. I loved Long Kiss Goodnight, but I DIDN'T love Die Hard 2, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger or Driven (and -- for the record -- I never actually saw Driven). There was some nice material to work with here, but it's often too gory, too hokey, or too plain stupid to work in the movie's favor.
The DVD extras were very nice and relatively plentiful. ""A"" for effort on those special features, but it isn't anything you can't see on PBS shark specials... except maybe for REAL sharks.

It's a neat sense of enjoyment you can only get from a shark movie. But alas, Deep Blue Sea has its flaws.

This is not the case in the thrilling opening scene, where some guy drops a bottle of red wine in the water on accident and a shark comes. Also, the-12-sharks-escaping-and-terrorising-people story is all entertaining, but how could the sharks fit through the corridors when they're meant to be super big?

Harlin  gives us everything he's got in the first five minutes and has nowhere to  go from there. Admittedly he's a professional director who the studios rely  on to deliver just this sort of product. On the other hand he's the same  man who gave us Cutthroat Island.
As for the movie itself - it's a Bad  Movie. If you like Bad Movies, give it 4 stars - it moves along at a good  clip, has a few genuine surprises and one nice twist at the end regarding  the shark's intelligent behavior. If you don't like Bad Movies, give it 1  star - it's classicaly Bad, with cardboard characters, huge plot holes and  unmotivated physical action. Other reviewers have already mentioned the  wildly varying speed of the sharks, inconsistency of bite damage and so  on.

1253436,3,B00002E23H,"I avoided this movie like the plague in theatres -- it really came off as a semi-schlocky ""Jaws"" ripoff.  But that was my loss -- because  ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a pretty good movie for the genre, and  atmospherically creates something new while working in the confines of the  enjoyably predictable ""people as rats in a maze"" formula.
""Deep Blue Sea"" actually owes more to the Alien films than to  Jaws, and the DVD edition offers wonderful extras that illustrate this,  including an entertaining commentary track, some breathtaking peeks behind  the scenes (the sets are phenomenal), and the usual gorgeous clarity of  DVD.  The film's underwater science lab has a greenish eerie shimmer to it  that the DVD does full justice to. I especially enjoyed the interviews with  the cast, all of whom come off as bright, funny, and entertaining people as  they give some memorable anecdotes about becoming shark bait (or near shark  bait).
Speaking of the actors, the flim's ensemble of people-as-fish-food  is comprised of some pretty good ones -- Jackson, Rapaport, and especially  Burrows, who makes a completely convincing scientist in spite of her looks.  (One side note on the 'official' review -- why is Burrows, who has now  carved a respectable career as an actress for more than 5 years, still  referred to as an 'actress-model'?  Hasn't she earned the right to be  called an actress yet?)  LL Cool J is a blast as a Bible-quoting cook, and  Burrows is a cool, calm center to the story, which offers up a few tasty  Science and ethics questions before the sharks get down to business and  start chomping.
The story is actually very clever, with lots of humor,  tension, and some huge sudden scares.  There's a twist in the end, too,  that literally made my jaw drop (I probably added a star to the review  based on this suprise alone -- when was the last time a movie REALLY fooled  you?).  The music score is forgettable, but adequate, and the  cinematography and special effects are gorgeous.  The sharks are by far the  most fun -- they're quick, smart, and even seem to have a devilish sense of  humor.  They're also, for the most part, entirely real (especially for  those like me, who see sharks even in the swimming pool).

1253438,2,B00002E23H,"This movie is so bad that I can't even begin to list the words to describe how awful it is (well here's just a few)...
1. A Tiger Shark? Please  don't insult my intelligence with a Tiger shark (the main food of the  bigger sharks in the movie) that doesn't even look like a real TS! OK let's  get a Great White and just paint stripes on it. Voila! A Tiger shark! Yeah  the stupid audience will fall for that...
2. Intelligent sharks? If the 2  big bad sharks in the movie are so smart and able to distinguish things  like a shotgun being pointed at them, why do they fall for the fire  exstinguisher/safety vest decoys that the surviors use at the end to fool  them? You mean they can tell whether somebody's pointing a deadly weapon at  them in dark water, but yet can't tell that the stream of bubbles is just a  open fire exstinguisher risng to the surface in broad daylight? Even a real  shark can tell the difference!
3. Special effects? I don't why everybody  seems to rave about the F/X in this movie. If you really watch it, you'll  notice the sharks and their jerky movments in many scenes. Yeah, there are  a couple of cool effects,but most of it looks like the poor animation from  the Land of the Lost TV show. Add all this up and you have a less than  convincing moster...
Do yourself a favor. Pick-up JAWS (25th Anv. on  DVD). Possibly the greatest movie ever made about humans and their fear of  the sea. Yeah I know 2,3 & 4 really stunk, but that's Hollywood for ya.  Like sharks smell blood, studios smell big money. And like any big hit they  try to work it for all it's worth...",966297600,,1597,4.26

Spot the  difference?
Not that 'Deep Blue Sea' was utterly devoid of hope. One  scene early on features Samuel L. Jackson looking down at the surface of  the pool, and a distorted image of a shark the size of a bus swims past.  It's one of those 'take-your-breath-away' moments, that makes you go:  'woah, this is gonna be good.' But then, suddenly, we go underwater, and  the film dies. The animatronic sharks were quite cool. The CGI sharks were  absolutely appalling, and being as most of the film was CGI, it looked like  some two-bit cartoon extravaganza. Each of the 'terrifying' death scenes  were some of the most hysterical moments I've ever watched. Computerised  sharks is one thing, but computerised people, with arms and legs kicking  around like some wind-up bath-toy? It was the fact that you never really  see the shark until right at the end that made 'Jaws' scary; the mako  sharks in 'DBS' are unveiled after about five minutes in all their  too-smooth-to-be-real glory. The scene in 'Jaws' where Richard Dreyfuss is  in the cage peering out into the murky ocean was one scene they couldn't  steal; the CGI water was absolutely crystal clear so that no matter how far  away the shark seemed to be, we could see it.
The story line is rather  plodding, our hapless heroes blundering from one mishap to the next. The  initial moral question about genetic manipulation, and the quest for a cure  for Alzheimer's seemed to be forgotten quite early on in place of the  'who's going to die next' formula. The sharks were hyper-fast and  hyper-intelligent one moment, then really slow and kind of stupid the next  (they recognise the gun, but with their highly evolved sense of smell, one  of them can't smell gas). Oh, and every character is munched with one  chomp, except a particularly tough rap star, whose leg is made of titanium.  I'll touch briefly on the characters: rigid, cardboard, who really cares if  they live or die? The only exception to the rule is LL Cool J, whose  preacher cook is humorous, interesting and always a pleasure to watch. The  only saving grace of this movie, and the only reason it got two stars, was  LL Cool J. Admittedly, he plays it very similar to his role in Halloween  H20, but why change a formula that works? The rest of the film can sink to  the bottom. And don't get me started about Saffron Burrows...",966297600,10,2717,4.81995661605206

1253443,4,B00002E23H,"Before seeing this movie, I was not much of a Renny Harlin fan. And  afterwards, maybe I'm still not that much of a Renny Harlin fan; I mean Die  Hard 2 was good, but it was far from its predecessor. But this movie--OH  DEAR GOD!!--it made my day, and the next week. Okay, so you have to be in  the right mindset. Summer-action-effects-extravaganza. Nothing more,  nothing less. But Harlin knows how to push your buttons; not the emotional  ones like Spielberg, but the gut-wrenching, visceral ones that make you  want to eat red meat and take no prisoners. (Sorry, I'm getting a little  carried away.)
Yeah, the plot is pretty simple. Scientists find a cure  for Alzheimer's in sharks' brains, must make sharks' brains bigger causing  them to get smart and do really bad things, stuff blows up, some people  die, some people make it. Most scenes can easily be deconstructed--this is  where the hero-stud tells Mr. Man how it really is, etc.--but so what, like  you're watching this movie (and it is a movie, not a film) for the nuanced  characters and subtle plot developments.
Maybe I'm selling the characters  short. Some are really bad, like the blond ""Let me explain the layout  of Aquatica"" chick and some are just awesome like Thomas ""Boogie  Nights"" Jane, as the hero-stud. This guy redefines the term. He's  saving lives, throwing out subtle one-liners, and just kicking tail and  taking names on practically a scene-by-scene basis. I could go on (and on)  but there are other things I must tell you.
For example, LL Cool J has  the best (ie chessiest) one liner: ""It's feedin' time"" (turn it  up and play it over and over again, baby!). Michael Rappaport is the  world's greatest underused comic actor. And Samuel L. Jackson? Where do I  begin? Just watch this movie and you'll know where I end.
This is not the  greatest movie I've ever seen. It definitely takes a particular mindset (I  know I'm repeating myself), but if you expect little, you will be awarded  with more than you could have possibly desired.

1253456,2,B00002E23H,"Though ""Deep Blue Sea"" has been compared most frequently to ""Jaws"" for obvious reasons, its real cinematic pedigree lies in the ""Alien"" movies, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and a  dozen other films featuring a small band of people trapped in a labyrinth  of corridors, fleeing either rising floodwaters, monsters or both and  dropping off one-by-one in the process.
Still, the ""Jaws""  analogy seems inevitable, yet what made Spielberg's film score as a  thriller was that it took place in a real world setting filled with  innocent people as its potential victims. This film misses that tension by  being set far out to sea in an isolated research laboratory where some  genetically altered sharks have decided to seek their revenge on the humans  who have imprisoned them. It seems inconceivable, but it actually took  three writers to concoct this ludicrous tale of a comely researcher's  search for a cure to Alzheimer's in the guise of raising brain-enhanced  giant sharks.
The characters fall immediately into their stereotypical  action film roles: we have, for instance, the sexy medical researcher so  blinded by her humanitarian zeal that she foolishly delves into the  forbidden areas of unrestrained genetic engineering to her and everyone  else's everlasting regret; the brawny pragmatist who undercuts the doctor's  idealism at every turn and who must try to save everyone with his muscle  and brain power; and the comic relief black brotha who quotes Einstein and  launches tepid witticisms at these munching predators of the deep. The one  moment in which the film seems to admirably recognize its own slavish  devotion to action movie cliches comes when the black man quips  ""brothas never make it out of situations like this, never.""
The  situations are often cliched as well. Let the cynical atheist, for  instance, utter one of his blasphemous we-are-greater-than-God statements  and we know he is destined to become fish food very quickly. The action,  too, is often incoherent, filmed with spatial confusion as to where in the  facility the characters are or where the sharks are in relation to them. As  to the film's derivative nature, there's even a bobbing corpse scene taken  straight out of the ""Jaws"" handbook. The film does deserve a  commendation for devising THE most idiotic motivation ever for getting the  brainy scientist to strip down to her undies to model her  aerobics-instructor body. Still, you have to see our intrepid musclebound  hero piggy-back riding the giant killer shark to its ultimate demise to  believe it.

Sharks don't attack from the head down and it's dubious to the point of  ludicrous to assume that one generation of genetic tampering would change  millions of years of successful predation in that way.

It's like one of those  movies you went to back in the fifties and sixties and wanted to stay and  see a second time.
The plot is a little far-fetched but involving; the  cast won't win any Oscars, but why should they in this type of  film?
Ironically, the least effective portrayal comes from the biggest  name in the cast -- Samuel L. Jackson.  It doesn't help with those goofy  looking glasses, but Sam seems to come across an African-American proud to  play a rich billionaire!  But it's not a BAD performance, just a little  under what you'd expect from him.  The best performance comes from Thomas  Jane, a really convincing everyday kind of guy who seems sincere in his  delivery and also truly plays the hero, but vulnerable and not superhuman!  I hope we see more of Mr. Jane in the future.
The rest of the cast is  adequate and effective.  LL Cool J continues to be a pleasant addition to  any ""scary"" movie (did you see him in ""Halloween H20?), and  he's fun to watch and cheer for.  Saffron Burrows is effectively icy as the  ""anti-heroine"", and even though she does her Sigourney Weaver  rip-off of running around in her bra and underpants, the reasoning is sound  and she even puts her wet suit back on rather quickly!

1253483,3,B00002E23H,"Turning dangerous wild, or fabulous beasts into credible film stars is an art which has evaded movie makers since the media was invented. There have, naturally, been exceptions. King Kong worked by humanising a 40ft. gorilla.  Jaws worked because the scripting, direction and acting were so damn good,  you didn't really care if the shark looked a little rubbery in close-up.  However, few movies have featured artificial creatures which genuinely  looked and acted like the real thing. This is where ""Deep Blue  Sea"" comes up trumps. The animatronic makos are truly state-of-the-art  and digital animation is used sensibly to create stunning underwater attack  scenes. From this point of view, the film might merit 5 stars. However,  there are other elements which downgrade the movie in comparison with the  benchmark shark (and monster) movie, ""JAWS""!  Primarily,  ""Deep Blue Sea"" is standard disaster movie fare....""The  Poseidon Adventure"" with big fish. The characterisation remains fairly  sketchy throughout and is sacrificed for the exhilarating pace of the  action. The casting is far from spectacular. Model-actress, Saffron  Burrows, is more model than actress and nobody manages to convey the  ""scientific"" content with any conviction. By contrast, the  casting of the main characters in ""Jaws"" was pure genius. Having  said this, LL Cool J does pleasantly surprise as the comic relief and  Kevin-Costner-a-like, Thomas Jane, is an amiable enough hero. Additionally,  whilst the attack scenes in ""Deep Blue Sea"" are superbly done, if  you blink, you may miss them. Whereas ""Jaws"" used the implication  that sharky shenanigans were on the horizon to create tension and suspense,  there is no build up to the pay-off in the newer movie. In conclusion,  ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a spectacular action movie and easy to  recommend for sheer entertainment value. But, whilst we await the release  of ""Jaws"" on DVD, I wonder whether 25 years down the line, the  memory of the sharks that outshone their human co-stars will be all that  remains of this film?",961200000,,2057,5.226993865030675

There is a bit of predictability, and it is somewhat formulaic but it gets the job done.  Its  just great action, great effects and a great end result.  One of the best  things i liked about the movie was the real deep blue hue that you see and  feel throughout the film.  Because everybody is underwater the whole time,  you almost feel like you are in space because it is so dark, and resulting  from that is a sense of claustrophobia that helps along the story line.  Some people didn't like this movie, because the acting wasn't very good,  and the characters a bit wooden, but if they weren't expecting that before  going in than of course you would be disappointed.

""Jaws"" ' s principal objective is pure terror, at which it  magnificently suceeds at.  ""Deep Blue Sea"" is more of a  popcorn-flick, the kind of movie that just entertains us for a friday  night.  Okay, so this movie isn't profound; it's not deep, and it's hardly  subtle, but it is a good whallop.  Some scenes are genuinely scary, others  genuinely silly, but that just makes the film all the more enjoyable.  The  lead actors lead the film with such a quiet delight, they seem to relish  playing roles in such a fun movie.  So it bogs down a little from its lack  of originality, but what's most surprising about the film is that it never  bogs down in  the sea of predicticality.  Certain things happen out of the  blue (and often, those are the scary moments) and there are times when we  can't catch onto their coattails because the plot twists ahead of us.

Sharks are a personal terror of mine, and like a car wreck you  can't help but glance at, I have to see all of the shark movies that come  out. So when I can almost fall asleep during a film about one of my worst  nightmares you know that the picture is a real snore. Even one of my top 10  favorite actors, Samuel Jackson, can't help this movie from becoming  chum(look it up).Avoid this film like you would...well, shark infested  waters!",960508800,,817,4.683098591549296
1253498,4,B00002E23H,"Your enjoyment of this film can be easily predicted in advance, based on your expectations. If you're looking for a literate, intelligent action-thriller with a message ... sorry! this probably isn't it. On the  other hand, if you're in the mood for a mindless, thrilling rollercoaster  ride that twists and turns but takes you nowhere ... you'll likely enjoy  it, maybe a lot!
The narrative really isn't much: it's simply the classic  film plot of Scientist Messes With Nature; Nature Gets Out of Hand; Who  Will Be Left at the End?  (You've seen variations on it dozens of times  before ... ""Frankenstein"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"",  ""Jurassic Park"", etc., etc.)  This time sharks have been evolved  into super-predators, and they're out to get the small band of researchers  who have been experimenting on them.  You know that only one or two people  will survive, of course; what makes this film of possible interest are the  shark effects (which are undeniably incredible), the underwater scenes  (great cinematography), some likable performances, and a few surprises  concerning which characters get killed off and when.  Are these variations  on formula enough to keep you interested?  They were for me, but then  again, I wasn't expecting too much to begin with, and so the film was an  entertaining surprise, a fun little thrill-ride.
The DVD transfer is  great, offering a sharp clean picture and crisp sound.  There are a load of  ""extras"", including a stills gallery, some deleted sequences, and  two background documentaries about the filming.

A scientist has found a certain chemical useful for treating Alzheimer's disease can be found in the brains of sharks. The  larger the brain, the more chemical is produced, and she quickly discovers  how to breed sharks with increased brain capacity. Unfortunately there is a  slight problem. The sharks got smarter.
From the second you see the  opening sequence you can almost count the running footsteps later on. Okay,  it's a basic thriller but the formula is getting a bit tired. Plus it was  produced by the same people as Deep Rising, so it does get a bit  repetitive. There are, however, some scary and shocking moments which have  you jumping in your seat - not least Samuel Jackson's untimely demise. If  you liked Jaws, you'll enjoy this.

It has been  25 years later and ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" has been released.  I wanted  and I didn't want to see the movie because sharks scare me.  Even hearing  the ghost shark stories in Hawaii...scary!
The colors were cool and the  5.1 sound is very nice.  I guess what was most shocking is who lived and  who got killed.  Some scenes were well done and a good shock value  especially the Samuel L. Jackson scene.
They did a good job with this  film and to make the sharks terrifying was made believable by the hard work  they put into this movie.  You can see the work in the filmography.  The  documentary was very insightful with the director and Samuel L. Jackson  giving their commentary on the movie.
All in all this movie will freak  you out, scare you and for a group of not-so-popular actors (aside from  Samuel L. Jackson), they did a good job including LL Cool J.

I think it works as a comedy, for it didn't scare me and wouldn't scare a five year old. The big problem  you would think would be its strength: the special effects. In Jaws we  rarely see the shark, a good device to build suspense. Take the first night  attack scene in Jaws(one of the most frieghtening in history) and compare  it to the ""scarey"" scenes in Deep Blue Sea and Jaws is a work of  art compared to this trashy sea-slug. The digital sharks look phony, and  more so the more we see of them. The actors save one woodenly sleep-walk,  wading waist-deep in a poor scripted downer. The only actor that was  entertaining to me was L.L.Cool J, funny and real as the cook, and when  these sharks with ""human intelligence"" get him in the stove and  turn the control knobs to try to roast him alive, all credibility was lost,  as I giggled to the preposterous end. L.L.Cool J. hopefully will be given  more movies, for he has real charm, and somehow you feel, while watching  him in Deep Blue Sea, that he is not taking this mess too seriously and I  suggest viewers follow suit, buy Jaws and see how real terror of sharks  began in the cinema.",960249600,3,1261,4.351931330472103

How they do it is they mess with  the sharks' brains and put a serum in it which makes them more big and  smarter and also more agressive.  After that all heck breaks loose.

1253503,2,B00002E23H,"Renny Harlin brings us another in a long line of really bad  action/adventure movies (Remeber, the man is responsible for ""Cut  Throat Island"") and while ""Deep Blue Sea"" isn't nearly as  bad as ""Die Hard 2"" there's little redeeming value here.
The  plot centers on a floating research lab (formerly a U.S. Navy submarine  re-supplying station) in the middle of the Pacific.  While trying to find a  cure for Alzheimers disease, the scientists have created super-smart sharks  in order to harvest chemicals from their brain stems.
Let's see how  many Jaws rip-offs/horror movie cliche's we can pack into the first 15  minutes?  Well, one of the sharks escapes and attacks (""this was no  boating accident"") two couples out for a sail before a very Quint like  shark wrangler saves the day with some tranquilizers.  The mad scientist  (She has to die, it's her fault, call it the poetic justice rule of horror  films) begs to be allowed to complete her work despite the danger to human  life.  The crew of the research station heads to shore.  (""We run a  skeleton crew on the weekends."")  Suffice to say, that later, as Sam  Jackson's character delivers a diatribe on the nature of survival, you  pretty much know he's going to end up as chum.
What else...Well,  according to this film, you can keep a zippo lighter underwater for about  half an hour yet have no trouble at all getting it to light.  Nearly an  hour after the expository lines on the former Navy station, we're treated  to an underwater shot complete with a sunken submarine, if you weren't  paying attention you might wonder why it's there.
In the spirit of Joe  Bob Brigs, awards for quality performances go to Sam Jackson on being lost  in an avalanche, ""Ice is a powerful thing, but it's nothing compared  to a man.""  Saffron Burrows as the mad scientist, ""it may be  super smart, but it's still just an animal.  Come to Mama.""  L.L. Cool  J on revenge, ""You ate my bird!""  and Michael Rappaport as the  Shark is being lifted into the station for research, ""Anyone order the  fish?""

The special effects  are ingenius, the acting is great, the sharks are scary as ever, and the  cinematography is perfect. However, too many people die. I think that maybe  more than 2 could of survived in the end.

The character development is near  non-existent, the sharks while beautifully presented do not come across as  clever (as they did in Jaws) and the plot is simple.
With the success of  Jaws, the director presented himself with a huge challenge with DBS and  unfortunately failed.  What I believe we, the viewer, would like to see is  a clever battle between man and beast including characters well developed  (remember those in Jaws?).  The plot was too simple (go from A to B via X  obstacles).
The biggest bonus was the extra features on DVD - while we  are in this transition phase (VHS to DVD) it seems that extra features are  exactly that - extra.  Anyone who includes them should be applauded to give  incentive to others.

It's so amusing how theytry to make a big climatic scene at the end like Jaws, only to makethe biggest anti-climax in cenema history.
I have never witnessed such terrible acting. The blonde guy speaks so quietly you can't hear a word that he says throughout the entire movie and he can't act to save himself from drowning.
The computer generated sharks look real but they don't act it. They start to do totally unrealistic things.
Everything together just makes a really bad movie
LL Cool J shouldn't (well mabey should) give-up his day job to turn actor. He at least atempts to be humorous.
The most frustrating thing about this movie is that the story could have been quite good.
People are farming genetically modified sharks for medical reasons. That's about the only belivable part of the story.
The farm is in the middle of an ocean, slap-bang in the center of a hurrican belt. That is just asking for trouble, and it comes.

1253520,4,B00002E23H,"Does an action/adventure/horror flick really need an Academy Award winning script?  In the case of The Deep Blue Sea, no...and don't expect one either.  With the possible exception of Samuel L. Jackson's ""One for All and  All for One"" speech which in itself is worth the price of the tape,  this movie is all about a nasty bunch of sharks looking for a few good  men...and women.
The sharks are the central focus of this flick, obviously,  but they are supported by two key players: the mad female scientist bent on  getting her name in medical journals at almost any cost (Saffron Burrows)  and the obligatory hunky, bad-boy blonde (Thomas Jane) who comes to  everyone's rescue.
In any case, think of this as Jaws Meets the Poseidon  Adventure.  Far more graphic than Jaws and with three sharks instead of  just one, you get to see plenty of shark action in this movie.  The shark  effects are pretty good and a fair number of people get shredded and  devoured by these now incredibly intelligent creatures of the deep, all as  a result of the mad scientists' scheme to find a cure for Alzheimer's  Disease.  Yeah...okay, whatever...

Well, in the process of  doing so, it makes the sharks smarter.  It is a very run of the mill action  movie, bringing little invention to the genre.  It's a Jaws wannabe.
One redeeming factor, however, is it will surprise you on who will live  and who will die.  During one scene, a character is making a good speech,  and then WHAM!

On the other hand, if you're the type who appreciates  well-crafted dialogue, excellent acting, and ""fresh"" storyline,  don't get your hopes up.  If you've seen a few  action-thriller/sci-fi/horror flicks, you'll be more than able to annoy  your sofamates with a score of predictions and forebodings -- most of which  will indeed prove true.  And the special effects, for all of the director's  boasting in the DVD's ""Making Of"" section, are not without their  flaws.
Samuel L. Jackson seems to have been poorly matched with his  scripted character; at times I wonder whom screenwriters Kennedy, Powers,  and Powers had in mind for the character, and whether a line couldn't have  been ""tweaked"" to allow Jackson's finesse to be better displayed.  L.L. Cool J, perhaps handed the light end of the film's burden, shines as  the witty, quasi-spiritual, entirely believable ""brother"" who  provides both comedy and sub-plot diversion.  (Do check out the deleted  scenes in the DVD version; they provide for many of the characters a depth  that I miss in the ""finished"" product.)

From all the reviews, i thought it would be interesting, and a halfway decent action movie.  umm...no.  the computer effects of the sharks are halfway decent, but the  computer-generated people look more like bad video game character  characters than people.  the characters had almost no depth to them, making  me not care whether they lived or died.  we watched the deleted scenes at  the end of the dvd, and if they had been left in, the characters might have  actually had an impact, rather than just be shark food.  the director, in  his commentary, kept saying that they took things out to keep the pace up.  i would rather have learned a little more about the characters.  however, i  did think ll cool j was very good, and he made it funny.",954892800,,796,4.546099290780142

As an action/horror film attempting to go against the  likes of Jurrasic Park, Jaws etc. this fails miserably.  I will credit it  with some sense of suspense, however the effects and storyline are - as  always - at odds.  For every dollar spent in the 'lab' creating the sharks  and blood, a dollar was lost from the realitly and story.

1253572,4,B00002E23H,"This film was a lot better than I had expected, and innocent of the accusations of it being a Jaws ""wannabe"", other than the Sharks there are really very few similarities to Spielberg's classic.  In fact  comparisons to Jurassic Park are probably closer to the mark, with the  basic premise of the two films being fairly similar, i.e. scientists mess  with nature, nature then eats scientists.
Deep Blue Sea cannot be faulted  in terms of entertainment, it is fast, frantic and stylish; the script  isn't bad either.  Where it does fall down though is on the quality of  acting and the inconsistency of the effects.  LL Cool J and Tom Jane both  give good performances but the rest of the cast (including the normally  faultless Jackson) are nothing special.  In terms of the effects i'm  probably being a little fussy but the film sets its own standards because  some scenes are are really very realistic and will leave you amazed, but in  other scenes they are far less impressive and obviously computer generated  (this may not be as obvious on vhs as dvd).
Other than those two minor  faults which shouldn't ruin your entertainment too much, I can only give  the film praise.  It is definately worth viewing, and the dvd is one of the  best around, especially if your a shark enthusiast like myself as it  includes brilliant extras especially a better than average documentary on  sharks.  The sound and picture quality are also near perfect. It's well  worth the money, sink your teeth into it now!",954547200,8,1503,4.736434108527132

1253584,4,B00002E23H,"I haven't seen any of the Jaws movies (pitty me) but I have a feeling they were a lot better.  ""Deep Blue Sea"" was a very entertaining movie in all its worth.  You didn't know who was going to get ripped apart next.  At the beginning you would think Samuel L. Jacksons character, Russell  Franklin and Saffron Burrows character Dr. whatever her name is are the  ones that are going to survive.  Not necessarily, as the movie goes on you  can tell that whoever you guessed was going to be alive probably isn't  going to survive these sharks.
The plot I think is pretty solid.  Two  scientists at the underwater laboratory Acquaticus are trying to develop a  cure for Alzheimers bye using the brain of sharks.  But to get all the  proteins they need they needed to enlarge the sharks brain and as a side  affect the sharks got smarter, a lot smarter.  Then a tropical storm leaves  the scientists and their visitors in complete and total darkness, plus they  are the mouse in a terrible cat and mouse game.
The acting isn't that  great but I can say the special effects are very good.  You can't tell the  sharks aren't real and everytime someone gets ripped to pieces you  shiver.
I think that this movie was a little much on special effects and  it could have had a couple of more scenes with actual meaningful dialogue  but seeing people get ripped to shreads is completly enetertaining.  Trevor  Rabin wrote the musical score and it is completely convincing to help you  along in the movie, plus LL COOL J, Thomas Jane, Stellan Skarsgard, and the  others, I think did a job well done acting.  It must be pretty tough acting  with things that aren't real and I commend them for that.

While the  movies ""Jaws"" and ""Orca"" created their drama using the  involvment of the male and female relationship between these species, and  did so with quite good effect, it seems that the idea of a society of  sharks with superior intellect takes this one step further.  In the movie  ""Jaws"" and in the movie ""Orca"" the conflict was very  viable as we came to see the shark and Orca personified.  In ""Deep  Blue Sea"" the story turns into one of survival of the best of the  species.  And, what most seperates this film from the films of  ""Jaws"" and ""Orca"" is that these sharks have an agenda,  an intelligent agenda.  This film starts out and grabs you, takes you in,  and doesn't give you much time to think before it moves into some excellent  action scenes.  The soundtrack is excellent, the acting balanced, and the  direction is well done.

""Cliffhanger"" and ""Die Hard  II"" director Renny Harlin takes us to a top secret lab where a group  of scientists are trying to harvest a ""miracle serum"" and save  humanity from Alzheimer's. The only trick is that they have to extract it  from a shark's brain. Ok, the plot is ludicrous at best but how it's pulled  off is quite a ride.
Echoing ""Jaws"", ""Aliens"" and  ""Jurassic Park"", Harlin's thrilling disaster movie with sharks  really gets the adrenaline pumping and never looks back. The only question  you ask yourself is ""Ok, who's gonna make it?"" and that's all you  need to be captivated. The visuals in this film make every ""Jaws""  movie look like the shark I used to play with in my bathtub. These sharks  are phenomenal.
A standout performance has to be the new heroic  portrayal of shark-wrangler ""Carter Blake"" played by newcomer  Thomas James. A cross between Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford, James  delivers us a hero not seen since ""Indiana Jones"" last jumped  across the screen. The type of hero we like to jump out of our seats and  cheer for.
As for the rest of the cast they sum up like this. Saffron  Burrows plays the head scientist who thinks of nothing but her career even  if half the people are dead.

In this film, however, the emphasis is placed on  action and suspense, with relatively few moments in which to catch your  breath.
 This is a very intense, suspenseful film, with numerous shocks  and surprises.  It's nice to see director Harlin (_Cliffhanger_, _The Long  Kiss Goodnight_) back with the sort of film he does best, after such flops  as _Cutthroat Island_.
 The effects work is top-notch, with several very  gruesome, gory deaths, caused by the swift-moving sharks.  Another plus in  the film's favor is that it appears that everyone is fair game-there are no  certain survivors among the film's cast.  Anyone may be attacked and eaten  at any given moment.
 There's little in the way of comic relief in the  film, although the character played by LL Cool J does add some humor, as he  bemoans his fate (to be stranded in a sinking research facility) and makes  various deals with God to pull him through successfully.  Other than Samuel  L. Jackson and the recognizable face of Swedish actor Skarsgard (_Ronin_,  _Good Will Hunting_), most of the cast is made up of unknowns, with Jane in  the lead role.  Before this, he'd mainly limited himself to smaller,  avant-garde productions, but here makes a convincing action hero lead.
  Sort of a pseudo-update of _Jaws_, _Deep Blue Sea_ proves there's still a  lot of potential in films featuring man-eating sharks.  This film is  strongly recommended to those looking for something to get their pulses  racing.",950745600,3,1642,4.883211678832117

In Deep Blue Sea, by the end of the movie, you  won't have a clue as to who's going to be alive and who isn't. Nobody is  sacred. If you can kill off Samuel L.

1253621,4,B00002E23H,"What begins as a dull and boring festival of gab gab gab elevates into all-out thrills and chills when the first shark attack looms up out of the water...literally. Apparently some shark flick made in 1975 was the  inspiration for this thriller and it shows. Experiments on the brains of  sharks are being conducted in the hopes of finding a potential cure for  Alzheimer's Disease. But their painstaking efforts prove fatal when their  work is suddenly disrupted when the shark they are working on gets angry  and hungrily bites off a man's arm in full camera range. From then on its  fear and terror as never before. Images from some little flick made in 1997  called ""TITANIC"" begin to look familiar as the survivors swim and  flee for their lives as the sharks charge after them. One thing they have  not counted on in their experiments is that they have made the minds of the  sharks to be more intelligent than normal and have entered the range of  human thinking in looking for their prey. One by one do the humans fall  victim to the sharks, most of them in gory detail with some pretty vivid  and realistic special effects. These should be enough to make you wary of  swimming out into the deep end of the ocean. The only flaw here is the slow  and gabby beginning, the somewhat two-dimensional characters and partially  dry script. But the effects and the frenetic action make up for these and  then some.

Get past the wobbly first five minutes however and you've got to grit your  teeth and hold on for the ride of your life!  Cos baby, this ride is one  fast, intense helter skelter that you're gonna want to watch again, and  again, and again.  Believe it!  Do you remember the days of brainless  action movies that just didn't let up?  Hell, you should do.  They made Big  Arnie and Sly famous.  Anyway, this is what this movies like.  Don't need  to think.  All you gotta do is prise your hands from off the cushions after  the rides over.
The movie itself stays true to the action movies of old  with some cheeseball lines, none better than the whole of Samuel L  jackson's hero speech halfway through the movie.
Unusual for a movie of  this type is that you see a lot of the sharks.  This doesn't take away from  the movie but instead, makes it better.  It's the flipside to the coin of  the shark genre.  Take 'Jaws' as an example.  Don't see the shark until the  end and then, it looks like a bus!

1253626,1,B00002E23H,"The reason why Jaws was a cinimatic masterpeice is the simple fact that there was a powerful suspense to Jaws. But not just that you had to have patience to watch it because Steven  Speilberg made you wait as long as he wanted you to to see the shark. Now here we are a quarter of a century later  some mediocre director want's to try his hand at making his own  Jaws. Instead of a penumatic shark movie magic has replaced it with digital  effects to make well more violent scenes. Yes they still had to make there  own sharks but a lot more relistic with todays advances in robotics and  animatronics.
  Our story begins with a woman telling her boss that she  may have a cure to alzhimers , the answer lies in a sharks brain not just  any sharks bio and genetically alterd sharks.
  Then we go to a  huge biological labratory it's purpose to genetically breed sharks to get ,  a chemical from the sharks brain to cure alzhimers .Succesufully we see  that the scientist in this
movie actually achive it from these 50 foot  man made mosters. This is a great start to a movie that could have been  good. As Deep Blue  Sea sadly turns into a pathetic gore fest the next  hour of the movie is pointless and just trying to get cheap imitation Jaws thrills from the audience. It's a good thing that when people watch  this when they have Dvd because people will want to slow his death down  with slow motion incredible and pathetically fast. Saffron Burrow's and LL  COOL J are the only things that make this movie worth  seeing , they act  suprisingly good for such a poor and down right horrid script and terrible  movie.
  The little Hbo docudrama is far more entertaining then the  movie it self and the DVD is impressive. But all in all Renny Harlin should  go back to film school if he thinks his film is a Jaws for the 90's and  learn something from a very good masterpeice director like speilberg.

1253629,3,B00002E23H,"Scientists experiment on increasing the brain size of sharks in the hope of extracting a substance that will help cure Alzheimer's disease; but the experiment has a nasty side effect:  it creates ""smart sharks""  who know they are being experimented on (I assume), break loose, and then  take no prisoners!  Some genuine jolts, as when Samuel Jackson's character  becomes fish food.
This movie is not JAWS, relying more on graphic  violence and spectacular special effects than genuine suspense build-up,  and it has other faults which I won't repeat in detail because other  reviewers have described them more than adequately (how do those massive  sharks get through those tiny doors, anyway?).  The blood, severed limbs,  etc., spill sufficiently freely that I can't recommend this to anyone with  a weak stomach--and I don't see how shark attacks four, five, six and seven  add that much to what happened with attacks one, two, and three.
But  there is something going on here which justifies our not just dismissing  this as one more bad gorefest.  Our moviemakers are continuing to serve up  variants on Frankenstein's monster, one of the most powerful and longest  running tendencies in the science fiction of the last century.  Think about  it.  Humans try out some half-baked, poorly thought out bit of  technological gimmickry involving tampering with life--under the assumption  that science and technology can ""fix"" everything--and then the  law of unintended consequences takes over.  Once you overlook the flaws  (which aren't that obvious on the first viewing), you realize that what  makes this subgenre frightening is not the creatures but what they say  about us.  We don't have the control over Mother Nature that we think we  do.
So perhaps the JAWS comparison is a little misguided.  Not a perfect  movie by any means (hence the three stars), but worth checking out if  you've a strong enough stomach.  (Radically shortened and cleaned up, it  would have made a good OUTER LIMITS episode.)

If you like pointless  movies with over exaggerated computerized special effects and cardboard  cut-out characters, then this one's for you. The only good part in the  movie was when Samuel L.

When we think of shark films we imagine humans in their  territory. In DBS we have sharks in human territory. This is a movie which  should appeal to everyone. An credible Jurrassic Parkesque story where  these biological farmed beasts take on man in his own environment. These  things are far more fearful than regular sharks. These fish are killing  machines with intelligence, strategy and pack instinct.
The story is also  credible. The special effects and thrill support the story rather than the  other way round. The special effects are amazing, and the use of  animatronics is fantastic. What you see in the movie is what you really  have - no computer effects. Well, OK, some but computer controlled  animatronic sharks were used extensively (computer effects were used where  the speed of movement of the beast presented a problem).

  The most clever part of the movie is the way the  screenwriter messes with your expectations for the plot. This leads to some  very funny scenes that will have you reaching for the remote to rewind and  watch again.
  One of my favorite scenes is when two of the characters  swim a long way under water to re-set some electrical breakers. This  requires them to hold their breath for about 5 minutes and when they're  finished one gestures to the other with a thumbs-up as if to say ""What  do you think? Want to get some air?""

I listened to his narration on the DVD after viewing the film for the first time, and my suspicions proved accurate - virtually every  scene containing any kind of character development was deleted or trimmed  for reasons of pacing.
What remains is an embarrassing concoction of  laughable dialogue, crippled logic and the most phony looking computer  animations I have seen in a film. The believability of the story hits rock  bottom when the sharks start to systematically herd the survivors around  inside the sinking platform. The swimming predators know so much about the  layout of the facility, that they have actually figured out a way to sink  it.  Harlin is a great action director, no doubt about it, but I have my  misgivings about the man when it comes to horror. You can't rush an  audience into a state of fright. You NEED the expositional shots and  character insight to really care and feel for the people in peril. Who  gives a rat's behind if Stellan Skarsgrd's character is eaten by a shark,  when we don't know him any better than LL Cool J's parrot.
The  mechanical sharks look incredibly good, but the biggest flaw of this film  is the Computer Generated ones. I'm getting a tad allergic to this stuff  now. If you can blend live-action and computer images seamlessly, fine, but  if it looks this fake - forget it.

Renny Harlin manages to give suspense to a very stupid story, mostly by ripping off some  of the scenes in Jaws shot by shot. Some of the death scenes seemed to  possess more comic timing than horror timing, particularly the demise of  Samuel L. Jackson.  The special effects are an improvement over Piranha and  Jaws, but one should expect this as both movies are more than 20 years old.  Deep Blue Sea lacks Jaws' human element.  No Robert Shaw's portrayal of a  salty old sailor, no youthful Richard Dreyfus playing a smart-aleck shark  expert to elevate this movie beyond shlock.
This movie has no logic, is  loaded with pseudo-scince and follows the routines of the traditional  b-movie with gusto by placing the characters in so much jeopardy that any  character development is immaterial.
