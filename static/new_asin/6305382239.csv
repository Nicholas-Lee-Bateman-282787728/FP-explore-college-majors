1016279,5,6305382239,"What most reviewers miss about this romantic comedy is that it's primo for its style -- Good Neighbor Sam, Please Don't Eat the Daisies -- and they decided to spice up the montages by animating Thurber comics (since the central figure is a misanthropic cartoonist who falls in love in spite of himself).  It's an old fashioned comedy, funny like they used to be: two dimensional characters, a conflicting love interest (Jason Robards taking a break from O'Neill for a change) interjected to put the heat on and help things come to a boil, and a flock of children each responding to the situation in a different way -- like the second tier comedia del arte characters.  Give yourself a break, get a bottle of wine, a pizza, and a friend with a sense of humor and make an evening of it.",1078876800,15,784,4.514084507042254
1016441,5,6305382239,"A quirky and intelligent film, this is not a riff on ""How To Murder Your Wife' contrary to the cover art.  Instead we have a movie based on James Thurber's life and the challenge of a man going blind.  At the same time he meets a woman with three young children.  Despite not liking children - or claiming to like women, or men for that matter - he gets involved in their lives and eventually marries the woman.  Complications arise, especially in the form of the ex-husband father of the children.  The main character is also loosing his eyesight but refusing to accept the fact.

As much of a comedy as a drama, this is not for every taste.  But if you like meandering plots that don't go where you expect and characters you change over the course of a movie, this is pretty darn good.  The acting is superb.  Jack Lemmon is excellent as always but plays a different part than normal, a guy literally stumbling his way around denial.  Barbara Harris and Jason Robards are also in top form, but it is some of the supporting players who really shine.  In particular, Herb Edelman as the agent and Lisa Gerritsan as the troubled middle child really shine.

This project evolved from the television program, 'My World and Welcome To It', and perhaps the direction is at times pedestrian.  But integrating animation and fantasy sections - particularly the ending piece, which still brings a tear to my eye - and a fascinating and complex plot with great actors makes this a treasure waiting to be discovered by the right viewer.",1468713600,2,1525,4.583025830258302

1016516,3,6305382239,"My guess is that, sadly, there are few people living today who know the name of James Thurber. A noted humorist and cartoonist, Thurber was hailed as one of the greats for many years. A TV series called MY LIFE AND WELCOME TO IT aired in the 60s based on his life and drawings. But today he is long forgotten. Unless of course you check out THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

Jack Lemmon stars as Peter, a divorced man who draws and writes for a living and who has decided that men and women should not co-mingle. In his mind's eye the only thing it leads to is a disruptive life at best and mental cruelty at worst. Of course this means that before long he'll meet someone special enough that he'll want to get married.

Enter Theresa (Barbara Harris), a woman he meets in the waiting room of his eye doctor. You see Peter also has a problem that will completely affect his work: he's losing his sight. This is not something he shares with anyone, including his friends. So this first encounter with Theresa doesn't go well. They do contact one another and eventually spend the night together. An interest develops and soon Peter not only finds himself married but with three children and a pet dog as well.

As if this wasn't enough to complicate Peter's life and his various crotchety attacks on women via his drawings and writings, Theresa's ex-husband suddenly falls into the picture. Steven (Jason Robards) is the adventurer extraordinaire, a prize winning photographer who has traveled the world and taken pictures from various war torn countries. He is a hero in his children's eyes and a pain in the posterior to Peter as he flirts with his ex from the moment he arrives...and invites himself to stay with them.

Seen at first as adversaries circumstances lead the two men to become friends of a sort ending with a war of cartoon characters on the walls of Peter and Theresa's home between men and women. Just how the actual battle involving all three parties is resolved makes for an interesting film at times but not the blockbuster that Paramount was expecting.

There are moments that are truly touching, most notably a story that Peter shares with Theresa's middle daughter Linda (Lisa Gerritsen) involving a world that falls apart and is saved by a flower. Based on one of Thurber's actual stories it helps her come to grips with the world she lives in.

This movie is being released on DVD and for fans of Lemmon who feel the need to own everything he ever made you'll be pleased. For the rest of us we get a movie that isn't too bad but nothing special either. It truly feels dated from the clothing to the atmosphere to just the way the movie is made. It isn't a great movie but it could provide a decent night's entertainment.",1393372800,4,2742,4.551724137931035
1016517,5,6305382239,"Jack Lemmon is great in this movie, but Barbara Harris steals the show. Like Edward G. Robinson and Michael Douglas- I never saw her give a bad performance. Its a shame in my opinion that Ms. Harris never hit it big in movies-although I suspect that the smart and astute Ms. Harris was smart and  discerning and took film roles that were first rate. I was 18 in 1972 and the movie is faithful to all of the quirks of that time ( the technology of that time-changing relationship roles and great sense of trust and order in the society of then vs the chaotic complexity of today's globalized world  .) This film  shows a world where at least the older generation :(Ms Harris and Mr Lemmon were around 45 years old when this movie was filmed)eventually sought after and found  romance old fashioned love and long term relationships were seen as desirable, possible, and the norm. What I like best is that  all of the characters in this movie  immerse themselves in the character so that you forget you are watching a movie and seeing a slice of real life. Indeed the movie was based on a novel that I suspect was based on actual life experience.  Young folks will find this dated for many of the reasons I've outlined, however it might work for them as a look into their grandparents world- and in some cases why people may think and feel they way they do.

In this romantic comedy based on the writings and cartoons of James Thurber, Jack Lemmon is a cartoon satirist and long-time bachelor with a dislike for women, dogs and especially kids, who turns his world upside down for love.

Peter Wilson's been blind in his right eye since childhood and now his left has developed a sympathetic disease that is likely to leave him sightless. While the good eye is dilated at the opthamologist's office he stumbles into another patient, getting a handhold on her breast to break his fall. An unlikely beginning for what would lead to marriage.

Book publicist Theresa Kozlenko (Barbara Harris) is a divorce with three kids, so based on Peter's propensities their union seems unlikely, but it happens. Barbara's ex, world famous news photographer Stephen Kozlenko (Jason Robards Jr.), shows up at the Wilsons' backyard wedding and he later becomes an annoying fixture in their home.

When his marriage gets a bit rocky, Peter's resentment toward this perceived rival for Theresa's affections turns to brotherly bonding. They tie a good one on and in an act of rebellion against wifely interference commiserate about this story's so-called war. This introduces an artistic highlight of the film. Peter draws on bare walls outlines in his inimitable style of two women on horses. They come to life and attack him and Stephen. It's women vs. men in an all-out to-the-death struggle that includes bows and arrows, spearguns, bats, biplanes and Moshe Dayan's tank..

The other Thurber moment is far more charming, a gentle scene between Peter and stepdaughter Linda (Lisa Gerritsen). He presents the troubled pre-teen with his latest work and they read it together.

7888434,2,6305382239,"I love Barbara Harris and have enjoyed many Jack Lemmon movies, but this one is a total dog that was also very weird.  It started out okay, but then degraded into the main characters sleeping together, including a scene where Terry Koslenko's (Barbara Harris) children catch them together and Lemmon's character is left standing naked in front of young girls and a boy (nudity is not show, but implied).  It's just offensive and turns hypocritical when the ""adults"" preach to the older daughter that she shouldn't be spending the night with her boyfriend.  Aside from the utter lack of morals or decency, the Peter Wilson (Jack Lemmon) character was a really nasty, selfish jerk.  Overall, I found it a very boring, offensive movie that was very anti-women, anti-marriage, anti-family and--ultimately--a massive waste of time.",1513987200,,826,5.141791044776119

7888436,4,6305382239,"If I could, I would recommend that you buy on DVD a series called MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT, starring William Windom as John Monroe, a James Thurber-inspired cartoonist who meets the modern world with a cockeyed and cynical view. NBC ran it for one year, planned to renew it, and then dropped it (even after it won two Emmy awards) in favor of Red Skelton, who was leaving CBS. Skelton tanked terribly on NBC and thus we lost one of the most amusing and inventive sitcoms of all time. Sadly, it is not on DVD to recommend (dudes, why not???). Suffering from Thurber deprivation after the 1970 cancellation, I naturally gravitated toward this film.

Sadly, it's not up to MY WORLD standards, but grafts 70s mores onto a Thurberesque character. Peter Wilson, full time curmudgeon hater of dogs and children and cynical of women, is at a visit to the eye doctor when he meets Terry Koslenko, divorcee with...guess what...three kids and a dog. After a wild night of monkey sex (this was the 70s after all), Peter finds himself falling for Terry, despite the kids, the dog, and her prominent photojournalist ex-husband, who the kids adore, and eventually marries her. As always, ""wackiness ensues."" And Peter is keeping a deep, dark secret from Terry: he's going blind.

But I still like it. It was a Thurber oasis, and Jack Lemmon is actually a little sweet as grumpy Peter softened by the very things he eschews, even though it's a terrible cliche. And I like Lemmon, and Jason Robards plays Terry's ex, and, as a bonus, Lisa Gerritsen, who played Lydia Monroe, John's daughter, in MY WORLD, is Terry's middle kid, who adores her warts-and-all father and who suffers with a stammer. (For the record, there's also Caroline, the stereotypical 70s rebellious teen, and David, played by the 70s-ubiquitous Moosie Drier, the little boy so traumatized by his parents' divorce that he sleeps in front of his mother's bedroom door and is afraid of everything.)

However, it uses Thurber's anti-war parable ""The Last Flower"" at the end, which saves it a lot in my eyes. Very 70s, and at least one of those stars is a ""just because it's me.""",1506470400,,2129,4.717741935483871

It has puppies in a box in the living room and is then taken for a brisk walk downtown. It gives birth to another puppy in the middle of a busy street. That's an example of the humor in this film.
