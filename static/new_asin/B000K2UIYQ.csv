2682606,4,B000K2UIYQ,"From age 6 until today (55+), I grew up with the music from this TV Special. In fact it wasn't until a few years ago, that I even knew it had been a TV special. So, if you know the record, this follows that pretty closely. The TV sets are pretty amateurish (compared to today), but I like the music so much that it kept my attention anyways. * My wife could take it or leave it, but she was impressed how Mr. Ford stayed unashamedly on the birth of Jesus, versus where we are today on TV. * The DVD is segmented into parts so you can skip to the part you like. You do not have to watch the whole thing every time. * The quality (imo) is lacking and many of the songs I still do not know what they are saying (singing), but it has always sounded good to me, reminding me of my childhood and parents. I was a little disappointed though during the story of the Christmas tree. 1. Mr. Ford has made it up, it is not in the Bible. 2. The audio skips when Mr. Ford tells the story. I do not think this is a flaw with my disc but rather the preservation of the film that this was transferred. It would be interesting to hear from other consumers if theirs skipped at this story also. Overall I like it but I do have a bias because of memories. * It's an interesting piece of history and if you have always liked the music/cd/lp... I'll bet you'll like this. God Bless.",1351209600,,1361,4.044444444444444
2682607,5,B000K2UIYQ,"I had a hard time trying to purchase this DVD, but amazon finally got it in so I grabbed it while it was available. I have not had time to view it yet (Christmas Season is a hectic time at my house) and I want to have the time to watch it in one sitting, to savor and enjoy. I have heard fantastic things about this show and am really looking forward to watching it. Will post another review after I watch it. But anything that has Tennessee Ernie in it is bound to be wonderful!

8154346,3,B000K2UIYQ,"Was disappointed by the grainy picture, had really wanted the CD and last year was available shen order placed but quickly went into a back-order staus and subsequently cancelled by Amazon.  The cd is back this year, but by private sellers and at a ridiculous price so I decided to try the DVD but not worth the money.  But since I have only the vinyl copy from years ago as my only other option, guess this might be my best option.",1420243200,,432,4.320987654320987
8154347,5,B000K2UIYQ,When I saw that this show was available I just had to have it. I watched the show back in 1963 when it was aired on television. It is a wholesome show that anyone would enjoy. My family was all gathered for the showing in1963 and they all raved about. Thank you very much for offering it,1382400000,,287,4.052631578947368
8154348,5,B000K2UIYQ,"This is a must have for fans of Tennessee Ernie Ford or The Roger Wagner Chorale!  It was a TV special, first broadcast in 1956. The production is dated compared to today's standards, but this is still very entertaining for a family Christmas gathering.  The broadcast is of historical significance, as it was the first hour long special aired without commercial interruption.",1377216000,,376,5.048387096774194

8154350,4,B000K2UIYQ,"I haven't seen this show since it first aired..it was a pleasure to see this show again.  Each segment was good, but I think the one with the donkey was the most fun.  The annimation for the Nativity was interesting in its simplicity.",1355270400,2,234,4.4186046511627906
