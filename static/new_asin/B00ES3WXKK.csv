8608849,1,B00ES3WXKK,"Complete overuse of different camera angles for no other reason than to display rich peoples' houses. The actors are a bunch of one-dimensional ""fresas"". The movie seems to only want to portray the ridiculous lives of excess that the rich experience in Mexico.
I was sick and tired of hearing the  ""fresa"" /condescending accent of the main characters that I had to stop mid way through the film.",1405728000,,395,4.8088235294117645
8608850,5,B00ES3WXKK,"I liked the movie. Story is entertaining, but the script/story is not an award winning product. Good for entertainment purposes only.",1390953600,,133,5.380952380952381
