a way between her life and her art seems like a good theme for any  movie..
Mixed with gorgeous glimpses into the life of a mujra dancer in Pakistan of many centuries ago, this story gives a lot of insight and aesthetic sweetness to a viewer...and the music is thrilling..",1296604800,2,341,4.246153846153846
2650989,5,B000I0RUDC,"This superb film features Meena Kumari, as Shahibjaan, a beautiful dancer and singer. The dancing is truly beautiful, elegant and unforgettable, as is the singing.

Credit for the lovely songs must also be given to Ghulam Mohammed, the creator the songs. Kamal Amrohi, a perfectionist, brought true perfection to this fantastic film with his direction. It was also obvious from the film that director loved his subject, Ms. Kumari, his wife in real life. The element of tragedy rings strong in this magnificent film, also reflected in Ms. Kumari's real life.

The DVD allows you to watch the songs, again and again. I've always loved the soundtrack/songs, such as Chalte Chalte, and now I have seen them sung and danced by Ms. Kumari. This is a one of the best Hindi language films I've ever see.",1249948800,5,796,4.845588235294118
2650990,4,B000I0RUDC,"I'm sure those of you with more discerning Bollywood interests are thinking, ""Say what? Four stars?"" but I really adored this movie. Pakeezah is the first Bollywood movie I've seen where the story line as well as the film technique have been equally developed. Some absolutely beautiful shots, interesting use of film communication, and a riveting story (I cried!). Only bad part, film quality is poor and so many errors in the subtitles that I'm assuming I missed a lot of the movie. The gist of the plot: a prostitute discovers that ""whores are soulless bodies"" and tries to break away from her life.",1180915200,9,602,4.798076923076923
8143092,1,B000I0RUDC,I was unable to enjoy watching the movie because the quality of the film was very bad. The picture was sometimes blurry and a number of scenes needed restoration. In fact I didn't sit through it till the end!,1466553600,,208,4.358974358974359

I would like a replacement.",1411430400,,136,4.269230769230769
8143097,5,B000I0RUDC,"This is an amazing movie that was started then shelved then finished years later. The actress Meena Kumari did an outstanding job after being persuaded to return to the film to finish it by Kamal Amrohi . It is a beautiful photographed movie, the music is epic and story is a classic one from which every other  movies is based on since( of course this one is base another not available) Should be in every Movie buff collection.",1394841600,,429,4.5
8143098,4,B000I0RUDC,"Great old Flick.  Subtitles.  Content is great, but video isn't best quality of copying over the years.  Still worth a watch.",1390953600,,125,4.857142857142857
8143099,5,B000I0RUDC,"Powerful story with a tragic touch, but real to the lives of the many courtesans that served the aristocrats, especially in the 18th century, Lucknow was the place for high quality art, mujra dance, prose and poetry. There are at least four major hit movies on the subject, but Pakeezah was the first hit film. The music directors Naushad and Ghulam Mohammed, actress Meena Kumari, actor Raj Kumar all have done a phenomenal job.",1360800000,3,429,4.8108108108108105
8143100,5,B000I0RUDC,"Excellent performance by Meena Kumari (1932-1972) and Raj Kumar (1926-1996), the theme and sets used are precedent for later movies on courtesans. The story of social consciousness as well the acting and dances are superb.",1360713600,2,222,5.371428571428571
