8206837,5,B000STWLBY,"BY THE SWORD DIVIDED is one of the finest BBC series ever produced--historically quite detailed, yet filled with the passions, fears, and hatreds that certainly possessed the English people during the period 1645-1660. Unfortunately and inexcusably, it has not been rendered in the NTSC (American) format; but with the purchase of a relatively-inexpensive ""all regions"" DVD Player (Sony makes a fine one, found online), this multi-disc series can be enjoyed.

For those addicted to intelligently produced series, for those interested in English history, and for those willing to experience something quite different from the run-of-the-mill ""historical"" drama on HBO or SHO these days, try this series. It's in TWO parts, the first leading up to the defeat of King Charles I, and the second part until the Restoration.

The quality of the DVDs is excellent, and the series will reward you. You won't be disappointed.",1249862400,16,916,5.310344827586207
