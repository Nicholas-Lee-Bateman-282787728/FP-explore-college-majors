404865,5,6301977270,"I first saw this quirky movie back in 1973, and I love it. This movie is an adaptation of Shakespearean plays. filled with murder, revenge and dark humor. I must say that it is a pleasure to see the critics get their comeuppances from actors for once. This movie is currently running on Comet TV, and is worth checking out.",1485043200,,323,4.4
404866,5,6301977270,"Vincent Price's best performance & best film! About a scorned Shakespearian stage actor who exacts revenge upon his venemous critics as the bard's characters. Nevermind if you don't know or care for Shakespeare; it's subtly over the top British humor, with plenty of 70's style gore. Assisting Mr. Price is the stunning Diana Rigg; star of stage, television and film. Still probably best known as The Avenger's Emma Peel, she's the only Mrs. James Bond, and recently appeared in Game of Thrones. The picture quality is colorful & sharp; small amounts of dust, but by far the best the film has ever looked. The audio commentary by 2 film historians is one of the best, most interesting I've heard!",1484784000,5,696,4.857142857142857

No one is spared, the ham actors nor the self absorbed egoists who lambast them.  Vincent Price has a ball and is surprisingly ""on the money"" with his portrayal of a self-deluded actor and Ian Hendry doesn't realize his character is just as bad as price.....no heroes here.  Diana Rigg loves playing his bland devoted daughter as well as his cockney sidekick.  This blu ray edition should have had wider release.",1484006400,,533,4.955056179775281

I watched the Movie last night 10-28-2016 it was Beautiful the colors and the dialogue were phenomenal,the Music which I think is a great score was amazing.

404936,4,6301977270,"Vincent Price's movies are almost always fun, but it's easy to miss that he was actually a first rate actor behind the often campy material.  His performance here is masterful, playing an actor who always overacts, but without overacting himself.  His character, an old ""matinee idol"" who thinks of himself as the world's greatest actor, is the epitome of any man who has devoted his life to a craft, to receive only scorn in the end.  In the meantime, the younger generation gets the honors which he thinks of as his.

He murders his way, one by one, through the critics circle which he blames for his humiliation, each crime based on incidents in Shakespeare's plays.  The fate of the queen and her children from Titus Andronicus takes a particularly bizarre form, with the ""queen"" and children not what one would expect.  He is assisted by a band of derelicts and a mustached assistant whose identity is not a mystery for very long.

The supporting performances are all what they need to be, but nobody stands out very much, with the possible exception of Ian Hendry as the last critic left.  Diana Rigg is good in a not very large role as the actor's daughter, as is Milo O'Shea as the police inspector in charge of the investigation.  A group of homeless ""meths drinkers"" are both assistants and an audience for the theatrical murders, and add to the atmosphere of the murder scenes.

All in all, this not so much late night horror movie fare as it is an intelligent black comedy.  I first watched this, on television, as a teenager and realized none of this.  Seeing it now, it's possible to appreciate the things that I missed the first time around.",1475107200,3,1656,4.633561643835616

I also liked the dated sets etc. they give a certain surreal feel to the film.  Overall, a fun film that should be part of a Vincent Price night!!",1473638400,,325,4.193548387096774
404939,5,6301977270,"Black comedy is tough to pull off but, when you have the right combined talent, it's a joy to watch. ""Theatre of Blood"" written by Anthony Greville Bell and directed by Douglas Wilcox features Vincent Price playing Shakespeare for the first and only time on film within the context of a black comedy tale of revenge. Kendal Lionheart received nothing but bad reviews when he lived from the major critics of London. He and his daughter (Diana Rigg) decide to take revenge but first stage Lionheart's death so he won't be a suspect. That revenge will be based on murder in the Bard's plays.

Featuring Price's future wife Coral Browne as one of the critics, Robert Morley (who exhibits more camp than usual clearly knowing the tone for the material), Jack Hawkins, Ian Hendry (who's departure from the original ""The Avengers"" opened the way for Honor Blackman and, ultimately, Diana Rigg to be propelled to stardom), Dennis Price and Robert Coote are an example of the terrific performers that play the worst possible critics in the world--narcissism incarnate with Hendry's character being the closest to a decent human being.

Twilight Time has done fans of the film a big favor by licensing the film from MGM. We get a very good transfer of the film--colors are a bit washed out but every version I've seen of the film haven't had bold colors that pop off the screen and they fit the gloomy, dark comic atmosphere of the film. Audio is presented in the original mono--dialog is clear throughout and we get subtitles (only )in English.

The special features are quite good for the film. We get a terrific and informative commentary track by Twilight Time's Nick Redman and horror film hisotrian Daniel Del Valle . Their commentary never runs dry. We also get a stereo isolated music track which sounds marvelous.  We also get a terrific and insightful booklet by Julie Kirgo discussing the impact of the film and providing a context for the making of the film. The special features are rounded out by two trailers--the original trailer and the MGM 90th Anniversary trailer.

Black comedies are tough to sell but director Douglas Wilcox, the writer Anthony Greville-Bell and the cast do a great job of bringing as much darkness to this film as possible.",1473552000,,2252,4.823834196891192

It's never been tougher to be a critic than in THEATRE OF BLOOD, one of the greatest horror comedies of all time. Vincent Price gives a career best performance as Edward Lionhart, a veteran Shakespearean actor who, when passed over for the coveted Critic's Circle award for Best Actor takes deadly revenge on the critics who snubbed him.

With one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled for a horror film including Dame Diana Rigg, Harry Andrews, Jack Hawkins and Arthur Lowe, THEATRE OF BLOOD is an dementedly funny and deliciously macabre cult classic. A brilliant bizarre 1973 comedy-horror, THEATRE OF BLOOD pitches somewhere between a Hammer Horror films and the Ealing Studios comedy classic Kind Hearts and Coronets.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 1973 was a vintage year for horror, especially with Horror Classics as The Exorcist, The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now and all undisputed classics. One film often over-looked by some more high-minded critics is the Vincent Price film THEATRE OF BLOOD, which has now been given the extra special edition treatment by leading UK indie label Arrow Video.

Vincent Price stars as Shakespearian actor Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, who, after a series of humiliating reviews from a group of critics, vows to take his revenge on them all, one by one. What follows is fantastic slice of British black comedy and a great mix of scares, squirms and laughs, as the critics are bumped off by a range of methods, all inspired, of course, by the works of Shakespeare, including King Lear, The Merchant of Venice, and, in one particular highlight, Titus Andronicus.

The supporting cast is a veritable who's who of British acting talent, including Robert Morley, Michael Hordon, Arthur Lowe, Ian Hendry, Dame Diana Rigg, Madeline Smith and Eric Sykes, but this really is Vincent Price's film; indeed it was one of his personal favourites.

While classically trained, Vincent Price was all too often typecast in horror movies of varying quality, but here as Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, recites passages from Shakespeare before each murder, you see that he really was the real deal, with a talent often far above the material he was given. THEATRE OF BLOOD should leave no-one in any doubt of Vincent Price's acting ability, even though it is within the confines of Vincent Price being the ham actor Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart.

Anthony Greville-Bell's screenplay strikes a great balance between the horror and comedy, with just the right amount of camp thrown in, while director Douglas Hickox [father of Hellraiser III director Anthony Hickox] stages the deaths with some very inventive visuals. Right from the get go this film establishes an infectious tone in which makes it near impossible not to root for the killer. Also unlike an atypical horror film where frightening the viewer is the number one adjective. This film's goes against the grain with its tongue and cheek humour, which also helps lessen the blow on some of the more gruesome deaths. There are so many factors that make or break a film and in regards to THEATRE OF BLOOD is it one of those rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. With that being said, it is not difficult to see how this film was Vincent Price's favourite film that he worked on.

If like me, you first saw this film at far too young an age on Television, then this is a great opportunity to re-visit the film. If you haven't seen it before, then please do check it out and you'll be treated to one of the best British Horror Films ever made. Arguably Vincent Price's finest single performance, certainly the one that called on all his varied talents as a comedian, aesthete, mellifluous speaker of verse, old-fashioned barnstormer and exponent of horror, is Douglas Hickox's classic black comedy THEATRE OF BLOOD, is the best of a string of horror pictures he made in Britain. If you have not seen this film I urge you to do so immediately! A splendid delight of macabre comedy at its best, this film stands as testament to why Vincent Price was truly one of the greatest artistic actors of his time. Because it is funny, shocking, innovative dark, and THEATRE OF BLOOD is truly a horror film classic!

Blu-ray Video Quality  The 1080p master for THEATRE OF BLOOD was produced by M-G-M and delivered by Hollywood Classics. The transfer is from a new 35mm interpositive and was done on a Spirit DataCine and overall this is a great transfer and this new Blu-ray transfer is about as good as the film is ever likely to look. The image is clean, with strong vibrant colours and very nice deep blacks. It is a little soft in places, but maintains a nice filmic look, and there's a nice lack of any apparent edge enhancement and definitely another great Arrow Video presentation. Because the 1080p HD master interpositive was from America and this is why when you see the start of the film you get the Title of the film as THEATER OF BLOOD and Arrow Video could not re-master in the English spelling, despite this, it is still a great quality transfer. All work was completed by Todd-AO in Hollywood, California. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio was made from the restored mono optical soundtrack negative. The audio sounds very clean, clear and well balanced throughout and though the more ambient aspects of the soundtrack are well represented. Range wise things sound rather limited and it was a shame the mono track was not able to be turned into a stereo soundtrack, but despite this, the dialogue is very clear and always very audible, while the music is very nicely reproduced and again Arrow Video has come up trumps again with their professional outlook.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

High Definition Blu-ray 1080p presentation of the feature, transferred from original film elements by M-G-M.

Original uncompressed 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio.

Optional English SDH subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of hearing.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith: First up, I can tell you that this is a total highlight for me, especially this particular brand new audio commentary from Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Jeremy Dyson, [aka The League of Gentlemen]. Anyone who has seen the The League of Gentlemen BBC TV series, Steve Pemberton and Shearsmith's Psychoville and Inside Number 9, or Mark Gatiss's History of Horror and Horror Europa documentaries will know what huge horror fans all 4 members of the team are. The influence of films like this and from studios like Hammer Horror films and Amicus are clear in their work, and one thing that stands out on this track is the genuine love they have for the film THEATRE OF BLOOD. The audio commentary turns out to be very informative, affectionate and is totally hilarious and very, very funny, and it's great to hear the gang back together again. Thank you, Arrow Video for including this track and please get them back for more, more, more!

Special Feature: A Priceless Potboiler: Victoria Price discusses THEATRE OF BLOOD [11:46] Here we have a series of interviews, kicking off with A Priceless Pot-boiler' featuring Vincent Price's daughter Victoria Price talks about her memories of the making of the film THEATRE OF BLOOD, and of her father's life at the time. In this interview with Vincent Prices daughter, Victoria Price says that she has seen THEATRE OF BLOOD more than any of her fathers other films. Victoria Price talks about her fathers status as an Anglophile and his enjoyment of the production of the film owing to his love of Shakespeare and his enjoyment of working with the other cast members. Victoria Price also discusses her fathers love of verse and his superb ability to recite it. Victoria Price reflects on her fathers working relationship with Dame Diana Rigg, and the sequence in which the then-sixty year old Vincent Price had to carry Dame Diana Rigg! Victoria Price also discusses the films more grotesque aspects and its ability to toe that line between camp humour, the grotesque and its pastiche of Shakespeare.

Special Feature: A Fearful Thespian: An interview with David Del Valle [10:42] Film historian David Del Valle examines the importance of THEATRE OF BLOOD for Vincent Prices career, in allowing him to play the roles he didn't get to play on stage. Del Valle mentions the films original title, Much Ado About Murder, and says that Vincent Price told him that audiences do not like comedy in the title; they don't like irony in the title. Theatre of Blood became Vincent Prices favourite film because he was allowed to murder all of the critics who labelled him as a ham and according to David Del Valle the film shows critics to be pompous, narcissistic, self-serving idiots. Interestingly, David Del Valle compares Christopher Lees range of acting as very limited scope, but instead he feels that Vincent Price was not and real professional and this is highlighted in the film THEATRE OF BLOOD, and he argues, in terms of how many characters Vincent Price plays in this particular film, he shows off his acting talent to such a degree of professionalism.

Special Feature: Staged Reaction: An interview with star Madeleine Smith [9:21] According to this interview with Madeline Smith, Douglas Hickox saw Madeline Smith in BBC TV series The Two Ronnies and asked to see her because he believed she was a blonde, whereas  Madeline Smith had worn a wig in The Two Ronnies sketches. Madeline Smith talks about the director Douglas Hickoxs approach to direction, by saying, he seemed to lack any humour and shouted a lot, Madeline Smith recalls, especially as a lot of TV directors are knowing they are really up against time and a tiny budget, very little time to bring the film on budget, especially pointing out actors like Ian Hendry always disappearing and drinking too much. Madeline Smith also reflects on the burning of the theatre, which was a real theatre, which features in the climax of the film, and suspects that would not be allowed today, but they were allowed this time, because the theatre was due for demolition. Madeline Smith says that whilst making these types of films, the ember films as she calls them, especially the last of the Carry On films, and the last of the Hammer Horror films, the last of the independent films at that time, audiences were becoming increasingly more interested in television rather than going to the cinema.

Special Feature: A Harmony for Horror: An interview with composer Michael J. Lewis [17:37] Composer Michael J. Lewis a chance to talk about his work on the film. Michael J Lewis is a real character, and the years have certainly not dulled his memories or enthusiasm. Michael J. Lewis dresses a little bit like Robert Morley in the film and has more than a little of the theatrically camp about him. He says he didn't have any great interest in the project until he discovered it was a dark comedy whereupon he gave it his all. He is seated at the piano and plays excerpts from the score for us. I'd like to see more of him on another release sometime as I'm rather fond of his scores for films like The Man Who Haunted Himself and North Sea Hijack. Michael J. Lewis discusses his music for the film and he refers to the composer as the tail end Charlie, and that we come in, clear up the mess, to fix what nobody else can fix. Michael J. Lewis says that he and Douglas Hickox decided to use music as a counterpoint to the action, rather than underscoring the music. Michael J. Lewis plays some of the music from the film and shows us the original sheet music. He also reveals that Anthony Burgess wrote some lyrics to accompany the music for the film, and Dame Diana Rigg recorded these tracks as songs which were never released.

Finally, Douglas Hickox's THEATRE OF BLOOD was Vincent Price's favourite film and it isn't difficult to see why, because it has a tremendous cast and the blending of totally brilliant British [tongue in cheek] humour. Horror is also very effective and it is also complimented by one of the very best soundtracks that I have heard created for a film of this calibre. Arrow Video's technical presentation of THEATRE OF BLOOD is of high standards, set by the Arrow Video Company's other releases of brilliant horror cult classics, and the supplemental features are once again very good. But most impressive is that the film was lovingly restored for Blu-ray by Arrow Video and THEATRE OF BLOOD, is a must-have for all Vincent Price aficionados fans like me, or anyone with a hankering for fine British Horror, combined with brilliant British comedy, especially from the early 1970s. It's really not that scary by today's standards, but it is certainly is a lot of brilliant fun. I did not see film when it was released in the UK cinemas, but now I am so proud to add this brilliant classic British Horror film to my ever increasing Vincent Price Blu-ray Collection and is a definite must have for anyone else who appreciates Vincent Price's brilliant professional acting career and I am a massive fan of ALL of Vincent Price's film. Also it's got one of the best trampoline-based swordfights that you will ever see. Very Highly Recommended!

The film is British to the bone and is an early 1970's send-up of horror movies in the same way Casino Royale camped up contemporary Secret Agent/James Bond movies. Vincent Price's superb performance in The House on Haunted Hill had stunned me as a 10 year old at the drive in movies and The Avengers was a favorite TV show of mine in High School. Unfortunately, other than the two leads, the acting in Theatre of Blood is truly bad, the plot lines and sight gags are predictable and the sets appear to be the leftovers found on the local back lot's soundstages. Still, I watched it through to the fiery ending, complete with ironic puns from the few remaining survivors.

405201,4,6301977270,"Vincent Price made several dark comedy horror films with a revenge motif, probably the best known being the 1971 THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES.  But co-stars Vincent Price and Diana Rigg admitted that THEATRE OF BLOOD was among their favorites of their own films--and both seemed to have the same reason.  By the 1970s both Price and Rigg were so stereotyped, Price as a horror star and Rigg as an off-the-cuff femme fatale, that they were shut out of other roles.  THEATRE OF BLOOD not only gave them the chance to poke fun at their own film images, it offered them a bit of a break from their usual fare by giving them chunks of Shakespearean dialogue along the way.

In one sense, the story is very straight forward.  Edward Lionheart (Price) was a Shakespearean actor more noted by the public than the critics.  When an influential group of critics refused him an award, Lionheart was so humiliated that he committed suicide--but now several years later these same critics start turning up dead, killed off in ghastly ways drawn from the works of Shakespeare.  Indeed, drawn from Shakespearan plays that Lionheart himself played in his last season.  The first to go is repeatedly stabbed, as was the lead character of JULIUS CESEAR, and others quickly follow suit.  Is Lionheart alive?  Is his daughter Edwina (Rigg) involved?  The obvious answer is yes, but the police are going to one helluva time catching up to them before they can kill off the entire cast!

The murders become gruesome as the film progresses, with the dispatch of Chloe Moon (Coral Browne, who shortly thereafter married Price) and Meredith Merridew (Robert Morley) perhaps the most grotesque, but every murder is executed with a wicked sense of humor, the dialogue is remarkably bitchy, and the whole thing can only be described as beautifully ridiculous camp.  Everyone gives truly snarky performances, and although it would probably help the viewer to know at least a little bit about Shakespeare, Price, Rigg, and company are so memorable that even the most anti-Shakespearean will have a good time with it.  Not among the greats, perhaps, but a lot of fun just the same.

405274,3,6301977270,"THEATER OF BLOOD(1973)---Vincent Price, Diana Rigg, Milo O'Shea, Harry Andrews, Jack Hawkins, Michael Hordern, Robert Morley, Robert Coote, Coral Browne, Ian Hendry, Diana Dors, Dennis Price.
This is one of the series of films released by American International featuring such horror movie icons as Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Basil Rathbone(some other films in the series include: THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES; THE RAVEN; TALES OF TERROR; TWICE-TOLD TALES; DR, PHIBES RISES AGAIN; and THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE).  In this movie, Price plays a hammy Shakespearean actor and Diana Rigg plays his devoted daughter.  After being panned by a group of leading London drama critics, and being denied their annual Drama Critics Award, Price flips out and confronts the group at their annual get together.  After verbally chastising them, he leaps off a balcony and falls into the Thames, apparently killing himself.  As it turns out, he survives the fall and is found washed up on the shore by a group of unsavory ""street people"".  Having completely gone insane, Price begins to kill off the critics in a most creative way.  With the assistance of his daughter, and the motley crew that found him, he kills each one after the manner of a killing in one of the Shakespearean plays that comprised the repertoire for his final theater season.  The first one is stabbed/hacked to death, a la, ""Julius Caesar""; another is drowned in a vat of wine, a la, ""Richard III""; another is run through with a spear and then dragged by the heels by a brace of horses, a la, ""Troilus and Cressida"", etc., etc.  The killings are depicted in appropriately gory American International fashion.  Milo O'Shea plays the Scotland yard detective trying to solve the murders.  As bloody as it is, this is just a fun film to watch.  Price is at his ""over the top, tongue-in-cheek"" best, and the unfortunate critics are played by an ""A"" list of English character actors.  Diana Rigg is quite good as Price's daughter, and she is at the height of her physical beauty in this movie(at least by my standards---but then, I've had a ""thing"" for Rigg since the days of, ""The Avengers).",1259712000,,2160,4.887671232876713
405275,5,6301977270,"Even in horror's hey-day, films like 'Theatre of Blood' didn't come along very often. Apart from Price, this is one of those horror movies  (like 'Twisted Nerve' - see below) not produced by traditional horror people.
You don't see many of the names flashing above TOB's imaginative title sequence, putting in a shift at Hammer or Tigon. You could take up a whole review just listing the achievements of the various contributors, and it'd be as fascinating as the film itself.
What you get when you allow 'strangers' into the (our?) genre (see also The Wicker Man and Peeping Tom) is basically just a fresh perspective; usually a director, alien to the peculiar ideals of the formulaic and the stylised, wanting to break out and compact a few new ideas. Fine in the case of Powell, or maybe even Kubrick... demented visualists who could make Hugh Grant appear scintillating, but it's left to chance with 'unknowns' however long they've been in the business and however worthy their intentions...

'ToB' is a seriously beautiful film; each performance is refined, subtle..and tongues are firmly lodged.
I doubt Robert Morley - and this includes telling nasty lefty PM Harold Wilson where to stuff his knighthood - ever enjoyed an outing more than he does here. As Meredith Merridew - theatre critic and TOB's chow connoisseur - wobbling about in a pink suit, wearing the same hairstyle as his delicious poodles and camping it up like Christmas...and his is but one glorious cameo among many.

Of course Price steals it. His Edward Lionheart is a joy, a celebratory peak in the genre. Tempering his moments of raving and savagery with tenderness for his devoted daughter (Diana Rigg - layered), and pathos - particularly in the flashback sequence at the critics post-awards ceremony bun-fight - Price conveys all the years his massive talent was cloaked in b-movies and schlock, while the gongs invariably clanged elsewhere.
He's on fire, playing the Shakespeare greats with gusto and vim: each reconstruction murder played to perfection, each soliloquy cherished and savoured. It's almost painful to watch: our gain is the actors great pain. I often see him elevating some over-composed, wobbling-set atrocity, and think exactly what he must've been thinking...""why ?""
Price retrieves every ounce of bitter experience he possesses to send Lionheart out into fantasy greatness. Every worthless line, every shady make-up in some addled hackery, every great role by-passed, every time his own stereotype punched him in the plexus, every time William Castle rang him...all crammed into Lionheart; fit to burst and reign bloody vengeance on the establishment.

'ToB' is a stunner. Resoundingly tragic, amusingly literate and about as good a genre movie as it's possible to produce.
Adorable, much missed Vincent's finest hour and forty.",1253232000,3,2830,5.159041394335512

Camp humor is a level of humor that requires some sophistication and this film is a Camp Classic.  In fact, Price thought it to be his favorite, as it is one of mine.  Its appeal is so great to so many, it was recently adapted as a West End production.  The high school theater classes I teach enjoy it as a halloween treat and springboard into our Shakespeare studies.

Aided by his daughter Edwina (Diana Rigg), and an odd collection of homeless people, Lionheart administers a gruesome version of justice with a profoundly Shakespearean bent.  The offending critics are dispatched in a series of creatively wacky and dramatic executions.

The tone is pretentious, and the humor very dark.  Price seems to delight in this role.  Robert Morely's performance as a poodle aficionado is just precious.  Price's duel with Ian Hendry is another highlight.  Avoid the release by Alpha Video, as the image quality is extremely poor.",1171929600,4,819,5.198473282442748
405280,4,6301977270,"Although Theater of Blood is not so much a horror film as a suspense/black comedy, it keeps getting cited in horror film references.  This is probably due to the presence of Vincent Price.  If Theater of Blood had nothing else going for it, Price's performance alone would make it worthwhile.

But Theater of Blood also has ... blood.  Blood aplenty.  And class, and style, and pathos, and hilarious black comedy, and ... Vincent Price.

In the film, Price portrays Edward Lionheart, a hammy, egomaniacal Shakespearean actor who fails in a suicide attempt after being passed over for a Critic's Circle award, then uses his second chance at life to kill his critics by methods drawn from Shakespeare's plays.

Opening credits play over old silent film footage of Shakespearean actors.  While nothing in Theater of Blood indicates that Lionheart ever worked in film (it's stated he never performed anything other than Shakespeare), Lionheart, like Norma Desmond, belongs to an earlier era.  Lionheart predates the rise of The Method in the 1950s, with its ""naturalistic"" acting style often derided by practitioners of ""classical theatrical style"" as producing actors who dressed dirty and mumbled incoherently.  (Marlon Brando and James Dean were accused of such).  Lionheart accuses his critics of denying him the award to give it to a youth ""who can barely grunt his way through an incomprehensible performance.""

Lionheart's egomania shows when he kills one critic by cutting out his heart, thereby altering The Merchant of Venice.  Lionheart's arch-foe, critic Peregrine Devlin (Ian Hendry), remarks, ""Only Lionheart would have the temerity to rewrite Shakespeare.""  Not having a son to christen Edward Jr, Lionheart names his daughter Edwina (Diana Rigg).  That Lionheart wanted a son is implied by Edwina's usual disguise of male clothing and mustache, by her incessant (insecure) desire to please him, and by finally dying happily in his appreciative arms, happy to have served him well.

A darkly comic commentary on the shared egomaniacal roots of artists and political activists is drawn when Lionheart concludes a thunderous oratory to his ragged street devotees, followed by a recording of a speech by Hitler (a former artist) inadvertently played on Lionheart's applause machine.

Theater of Blood depicts an actor's exaggerated view of critics.  They can afford expensive homes and lavish offices, exploit young actresses for sex, and expend more effort in writing clever insults than in staying awake to see a complete play.  They enjoy hurting actors.  Devlin confesses to the detective inspector that when Lionheart broke into the Critic's Circle meeting after losing the Best Actor Award, they had fun at his expense.

Critics are twice criticized for their abuse of power.  Once when the detective inspector suggests possible motivations as to why someone may want to kill them.  A second time when Lionheart justifies his murders to Devlin.  In both instances, the point is made that a negative review can close a production, ruin reputations, bankrupt people, destroy lives.  Few, if any, critics have such power today (perhaps more so in theater than in film, more so in Britain than in the U.S.).  But to insecure actors in an insecure profession, reviews take on exaggerated importance.

If Lionheart is an egomaniac, his critics are worse.  They too have egos, but they lack Lionheart's cunning intelligence and perverse imagination.  One lecherous old man readily accepts that a young actress (Edwina) is flirting with him.  Another is unsuspicious when Lionheart selects him alone to report the exclusive story of Lionheart's comeback.  Another sees nothing amiss with a TV crew arriving unannounced at his house, himself the center of attention.  Another shrugs off Princess Margaret's hairdresser coming in after-hours, especially for her.  Another agrees to help police toss out squatters, because the police need someone with an air of authority (something the police lack!).  All traps by Lionheart, all successful because these critics' egos block their brains.

The one critic who survives is Devlin, who doesn't trust Edwina's pretty, frightened daughter act.  Devlin tells her there is a homing device in the car's glove compartment, but not about the police constable in the trunk.  He is also the only critic of those given time to recant, who refuses to change his critical opinion of Lionheart's abilities (others deny their past comments or agree to everything Lionheart says).

There is a nascent astrology motif.  One critic's wife cautions him about his horoscope.  Another critic wears a huge gold Scorpio medallion around his neck.  Most likely, this is merely reflecting the times.

Theater of Blood's gruesome murders are leavened with campy black comedy.  Even as Lionheart decapitates one critic, he rolls eyes at Edwina's theatrical handling of medical instruments.  And his forcing one effete critic (Robert Morley) to eat his poodles, baked in a pie, is a classic scene of horror black comedy.

Theater of Blood is a sumptuous production with lavish sets and costumes.  Extreme high and low camera angles heighten the melodrama.  The sudden switch from a straight-on to extreme high angle just as the critics open the drapes to view Lionheart about to jump off the balcony creates a sense that we are looking down on a stage with the curtain opening upon a performance.  Anthony Greville-Bell's literate script artfully integrates select Shakespearean dialogue into contemporary proceedings that are alternatingly macabre, comic, or poignant.  The musical score supports the story, shifting from gentle to dramatic as required, without ever overwhelming events on screen.  However melodramatically the music swells, Lionheart matches it.  Vincent Price shines.

A year later, tables were turned on Price in Madhouse (aka The Revenge of Doctor Death).  In this film, Price is a has-been horror film star victimized by frustrated writer Peter Cushing.  Yet while vengeful writers have their own subgenre, Theater of Blood's enduring fame compared to Madhouse's relative obscurity demonstrates why actors get the glory while writers more often toil in anonymity.  Lionheart's extroverted exuberance, shameless scene-stealing, and indestructible ego is a crowd-pleaser, easily steamrollering over the vengeance meted out by cool Cushing's introverted writer.  As the tabloids have long known, actors make for colorful villains, which is why they get the cover while writers must settle for a byline.

Theater of Blood is bloody good entertainment: horrific, insightful, and wryly humorous.",1149379200,7,6636,5.357487922705314
405281,5,6301977270,"A truly delightful film about austere thespian Richard Lionheart, who was under-appreciated by his so-called 'peers'. is unjustly robbed of his rightful award, and thus nobly seeks to correct the wrong done to him by unperceptive ingrates.

Thus, he admonishes the talentless worm-like critics, and in a fit of depression, hurls himself from a balcony to the horror of his impressively devoted daughter, where he finds surprisingly unexpected company with derelicts, who sought to rob him until they realize the seemingly lifeless body has resurrected. They become his minions in a darkened theatre where he relives and performs his timeless plays with traditional flare, ingeniously planning his revenge all the while.

And thus, true to his romantic nature, subsequently administers well-deserved and amusingly devilicious punishments upon his rotten detractors. Supremely poetic, one by one they are lured into Shakespearian tragedies which were on the itinerary the night of the misplaced recognition, with minor modifications due to environment and practicality:

Julius Caesar: Critic stabbed to death on the Ides of March by Lionheart's killer hippies.

Troilus and Cressida: Critic dragged to death by a horse in front of a funeral being held for the previous victim.

Cymbeline: Critic electrocted.

The Merchant of Venice: Critic impaled, heart removed, weighed to be a perfect pound, and mailed to The Police in an ornate box.

Richard the Third: Critic suffocates own wife in a mad fit of jealousy, whose lover was actually Lionheart in disguise. He will of course perish in prison, and is thusly 'destroyed'.

Romeo and Juliet: Focusing on another scene within the play entirely, an alcoholic critic is drowned in a vat of wine.

Henry the Sixth, part 1: .Critic is surgically beheaded in own bed next to wife amidst the pleasant strains of Beethoven.

Titus Andronicus: Corpulent critic suffocated by mass amounts of the flesh of his own odious poodles, while their little heads repose upon a platter as if witnessing his demise.

King Lear / Othello: Epic fencing wherein Lionheart displays remarkable feats of acrobatics and skill, followed by the defeated 'ringleader' of the critics being restrained within a contraption, and subjected to two perfectly positioned red-hot glowing daggers aimed for his eyes.

After experiencing the fulfillment of the sweet satisfactions of his vengeance, Lionheart unfortunately himself becomes a character in his own tragedy, plunging once more unto terra firma in one last blaze of glory, whose infamy remains immortal.

If you enjoyed some of Vincent Price's other films, such as Last Man on Earth(one of the absolute scariest), House on Haunted Hill, Cry of the Banshee, Tower of London, and others, you will love this. With dark, witty humour and some truly horrific scenes, this movie is well worth your money and time. The synopsis is as follows: an underappreciated stage actor by the name of Richard Lionheart attemps suicide after being denied the ""best actors award."" However, his suicide fails, and he is discovered by a group of bums who help him and eventually assist him in his dirty deeds, along with his vengeful daughter, Edwina. He begins killing the critics who panned his performances, usually luring them to his secret playhouse using his daughter (who is disguised in various ways). He kills all but one critic, and the end I will leave for you to find out. This is a scary and humourous film that will make you cower in fear and laugh delightfully. Then again, if Vincent Price is in it, how could you expect any less? I reccommend buying this movie on the double feature disc along with ""Madhouse,"" another horror film with Price and Peter Cushing that I have unfortunately not seen yet. I will, though, when I buy this wonderful movie on the double disc.

Vincent Price, in the role of a lifetime, plays hack British actor Edward Lionheart, who goes to extremes to get revenge upon a group of smug theatre critics who denied him a Best Actor award.  Price is obviously having a glorious time as Lionheart (and his snippet as Shylock is so wonderful it makes one wish he had gotten the chance to do the entire play on film), but the film also features an incredible supporting cast as the critics, all of whom wryly represent one of the seven deadly sins each.

405327,5,6301977270,"I must confess I had a slightly different movie in mind with ""Theater of Blood"" ... I expected star Vincent Price to be way over the top, with gallons of blood spilling everywhere and a totally crazy, highly obvious sense of humor.  Reviews which I'd read up until then had given me a totally different impression of what to expect, while still describing the film accurately.  I was surprised to discover, upon watching this masterpiece, that it really takes itself quite seriously (or at least, more than I thought it would), that Mr. Price is actually very intense, and the sense of humor, while still very present, is both a bit more restrained and a bit more subtle than I'd anticipated.  But this in no way means I was disappointed ... rather, I enjoyed viewing ""Theater"" very much indeed.

Price plays a failed actor, one Edward Lionheart, who in spite of being thought dead is really alive and well, and has begun plotting his murderous revenge on the critics who cursed his career by giving his performances bad reviews.  Through a series of highly entertaining vignettes, we watch Lionheart carry out his plans with the help of a troupe of homeless meths drinkers who have taken up residence in the abandoned theater he's decided to call home, along with the aid of a mysterious young man with a huge Derek Smalls-esque mustache and poofy, poofy hair (ah, the Seventies ... ).  Each murder is taken from a play by William Shakespeare, and I'm shamed to say (as someone who's scarcely touched anything written by the man, save for ""Julius Caesar"" in high school) that I was able to recognize only one of them (the first one, which is based on the murder of Julius Caesar, naturally).  The ways these murders are carried out have to be seen to be believed, and they are the chief source of the pleasure that is to be found in watching this film (after Price's simultaneously intense, flamboyant, tragic, and humorous performance, I should say).  My favorite among them, involving a bedside beheading, was loaded with precious moments and needs to be watched at least twice with each viewing.

Though not what I expected, ""Theater"" was excellent nevertheless, and is certain to become a favorite for anyone who enjoys horror stories, tales of murder or suspense, black (and red) comedy, or just watching a master actor give the performance of his life (playing, of all things, an actor giving the performance of his life).  The DVD is very basic, providing only a trailer in the way of bonus material (and it's not a very good one ... don't watch it till after you've seen the movie, or it will spoil a number of the best parts).

405328,4,6301977270,"UPDATE FEBRUARY 13, 2018: I no longer watch horror films and do not endorse this film, this is just an old review.

ORIGINAL MAY 25, 2004 REVIEW:  This is a twisted little movie, about what happens when your words come back to bite you in the butt.  Being a critic, it makes me think twice about what I say, not that I think someone will come and sadistically murder me, but it says something of the power of this film, and it has never left my mind since I first watched it nearly 13yrs ago in 2004.  This is a film that will stick with you, it is hard to watch, but yet hard to turn away from, as is true with any truly great horror film, and it will leave you guessing to the very end, just when you think you've got it figured out, just wait, there's more!

  Being the masochist I am, I sat through the whole film. It was enjoyable, especially for Prices over-the-top super-campy performance. What made it hard to watch this film, was the deaths, certainly for the early 70's this film was a bit gratuitous, even for today it still is in some reagrds(films such as this really make you realize how crappy digital effects are compared to practical ones). I was empathizing with the victims to much obviously because every time someone died I had a large knot in my stomach. I can't even think of the death which happens in a kitchen without getting sad, it is one of the most twisted death scenes I have ever seen, that one made me cry, and I still get upset when I think about it (13yrs later! 12/5/17). :(

  Diana Rigg was very good as Vincent's daughter as well. I rather wanted to shoot her, she was that convincing. Hadn't seen her in any other movies prior to this one at the time(I have now), but she was high effective in this one. I am a HUGE fan of horror, and Vincent Price is one of my favorite actors, so how can you go wrong with such a sadistic film? Its absolutely perfect for Price, he's flawless. I will say, as much as I love horror, I had a hard time watching this, in a good way.  It certainly, in many ways, is a precursor to the torture films that were big in the early to late 2000's

  I highly recommend 'Theater of Blood' to fans of horror, campy films, black comedy, or Vincent Price, even better yet if you're a fan of all four.

405329,4,6301977270,"Hammy Shakespearean actor Edward Lionheart (Vincent Price) has been relentlessly denounced and vilified in the reviews of his performances, so with help from his daughter Edwina (Diana Rigg), he fakes his death and then sets in motion his grisly plans for revenge.  One by one, he murders his most vociferous critics, but his technique isn't that of a common street thug, oh no.  Instead, Lionheart patterns each killing after one of the various murders described in The Bard's plays!
Many real-life critics have tried to minimize the importance or quality of 1973's THEATRE OF BLOOD by pointing out its similarities to Price's earlier flick THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES (1971).  While it is certainly true that both films seem to have been cast from the same mold--in the 1971 film, Dr. Phibes exacts revenge by patterning his homicides after the great plagues in the Bible--that doesn't detract in the least from overall enjoyment of watching this flick.  The clever script contains tons of funeral-parlor puns and lots of gallows humor, and the stellar cast brings it all off wonderfully.  Star Vincent Price is allowed to draw upon his Shakespearean stage experience and vigorously chew the scenery, but this is judiciously tempered with an excellent but more restrained supporting cast that includes the pretty Diana Rigg, Ian Hendry, Milo O' Shea, Eric Sykes, and countless other well-known British character actors.
The DVD from MGM--part of their excellent ""Midnite Movie"" series, which rescues lots of gems like this from the dungeon of late-night TV--offers a reasonably nice digital transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  Some buyers have complained that the picture is a bit washed and the sound a bit muffled, but the copy of the flick on this disc is light-years ahead of any copy previously available on VHS.  The only extra is the original trailer.  But this DVD is so reasonably priced that one can't complain too much--especially if one wants to avoid the wrath of Edward Lionheart, eh?
Okay, THEATRE OF BLOOD is admittedly a one-joke movie, but it's all carried out in such an amusing and clever way that viewers are NEVER bored.  Watching it is a must for fans of campy horror and gallows humor, and it's a must-own for fans Vincent Price or Diana Rigg.

Thought dead after an apparent suicide attempt witnessed by that circle of persnicketty critics - including the late-great Robert Morley - Lionheart survives and returns to exact a cruel revenge on his ""enemies"".  Using an actor's mastery of disguise and improvisation, and knowing of his enemies weaknesses, Lionheart takes each critic out one by one.  Resorting to ever elaborate means of murder - each suggested by works of Shakespeare - Lionheart deprives the British stage of one critic at a time, outwitting the surviving critics and the team of crack detectives sent to protect them.

405372,5,6301977270,"Who knew Shakespeare could be so much fun?  More often than not, his plays seemed to put me to sleep in high school literature class.  Funny how a movie like this can make you see things in a different light, even make you appreciate his work.  I guess it's all in the presentation.

In Theater of Blood, Vincent Price plays Edward Lionheart, a Shakespearian actor who takes revenge on his critics through some particularly devious means after suffering many a bad review.  What I really enjoyed, besides Price's outstanding performance, was how he incorporated the murders to fit in with Shakespearian plays.  It was a really nice touch that elevated this movie from your typical horror movie to a masterpiece of the genre.

Price plays it perfectly, as an over the top actor, quoting lines from various plays as the curtain falls on each of his victims.  I loved how he had that big book containing all his reviews, to which he would refer before dispatching some of his intended targets.  Also, I thought Diana Rigg was wonderful as Price's daughter, Edwina.  Not only is she very easy on the eyes, but also she complimented Price's performance nicely.  If you've seen the earlier Price movie, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, you will certainly recognize a number of similarities in the plot of both movies.  Both involve the main character supposedly coming back from the dead to exact revenge.  In 'Phibes', his vengeance is focused on the doctors and nurses Price feels are responsible for his wife's death, while here his wrath is aimed at those responsible for the death of his career.  Also, both movies involve meticulous planning of the murders to fit into a specific, overall theme, including rather gruesome and horrifying means of demise for the intended victims.

It's all played tongue in cheek, and works so well.  This is one of my favorite Price films, and really excellent example of him at his best.  If for nothing else, this movie is worth watching to see Price in the guise of a hairdresser, in setting up a death sequence with a female victim.  Seeing him in those groovy clothes, glasses stolen from Elton John, and ridiculously oversized afro is truly 'priceless'.

405375,5,6301977270,"As incredibly good as this movie is, one must give pause before attempting to review it; after all, Vincent Price plays an actor who murders the critics who panned his performances and cost him the acting award he felt he deserved.  I find it something of a relief to have nothing at all negative to say about this unusual, almost brilliant movie.  This is essentially a slasher film, but it differs markedly from its modern counterparts by injecting the story with intelligence, culture, and actual feeling.  Vincent Price plays Edward Lionheart, a Shakespearean actor who deigns to perform no dramas not penned by the Bard.  There is no better actor, he truly believes, than himself, and thus he is slowly crushed by the stream of bad reviews the local critics hurl down upon his performance in one play after another.  After facing humiliation at an annual awards banquet, he takes his own life-or at least so everyone thought at the time, despite the fact that his body was never found.  Two years later, a literary critic dies mysteriously on the ides of March of multiple stab wounds.  Then a second critic is killed and his body dragged through the streets behind a horse.  As more critics die, it begins to become clear, even to the rather ineffectual police, that the murders are all patterned on the death scenes of Shakespearean dramas.  After the fourth murder, where the culprit deviates from the script of The Merchant of Venice by literally taking a pound of flesh from the victim, the de facto leader of the critics knows that Lionheart is the murderer because ""only he would have the temerity to rewrite Shakespeare.""  The deaths here range from the somewhat comical to the ludicrously horrid to the deliciously gruesome, with a few nice touches of 1973-style blood thrown in for good measure.  Each murder is of course accentuated by a vainglorious dramatic performance by Lionheart.  This imbues the movie with both maudlin comedy as well as academic pretentiousness.  At the very end, even more unexpected emotions bubble up in the viewer, a phenomenon manifesting itself through a combination of Price's perfectly over-the-top acting and a wonderfully evocative soundtrack.
One actually gets something of a lesson in Shakespeare in this film.  Lionheart doesn't base his revenge killings on Shakespeare's most famous plays-instead, he draws on several that I and probably many others are not intimately familiar with-yet the magic he breathes into each scene makes one anxious to delve into the Bard's original plays themselves.  In total, the following Shakespearean plays serve as the basis of the murders: Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida, Cymbeline, The Merchant of Venice, Richard the Third, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Henry the Sixth, part 1, Titus Andronicus, and King Lear.  A little Hamlet is also thrown in for good measure.  I must say that the cast is a great complement to the storyline, although even the lovely Diana Rigg of Avengers fame pales in the shadow of Price's mesmerizing aura as he brings to life a character seemingly written especially for him.  Who else could have played such a convincing Shakespearean actor and ingeniously mad killer simultaneously?  I must admit it is somewhat strange to watch Rigg play the role of Lionheart's fiercely loyal daughter, though, and I daresay that many Rigg devotees such as myself may not even recognize her when she first appears.
Theater of Blood is truly one of Vincent Price's most memorable performances.  His ability to morph into and truly become different Shakespearean characters is superb, and the range of emotions he is able to express is pretty powerful, especially in the closing moments of the film.  A couple of the killings are somewhat farcical, but most of them are rather ingenious and fascinating.  Just wait until you see Price playing the role of a bushy-headed hairdresser.  The best killing, without a doubt, involves a surgical gown, a scalpel, and a handsaw-I'll let you figure out what Lionheart does with these items.  The idea for this movie may not be wholly original, but Theater of Blood works magnificently, and the combined talents of Price and Rigg make this a classic that really should find a home in the collection of all horror movie buffs.",1044576000,39,4271,4.9915373765867415

Edward Lionhart {played by Price} was a ham actor on the theatre circuit who loved the works of Shakespeare so much that he devoted his career to various salutes and tributes to the playwright. London's top critics felt Lionhart wasn't being too original and they became annoyed at his Shakespeare tributes and so they always gave him terrible reviews simply because they wanted him to take the hint and do something other than Shakespeare. Well, Lionhart felt he deserved the Critics Circle Award but the critics gave it to a newcomer over legendary Lionhart. This prompted him to jump from a multi-story complex and be presumed dead. He comes back to life and aided by his demented daughter, the two kill the eight of the nine critics who were the most insensitive with their reviews. Each critic is killed using the murders from the Shakespeare plays they respectively panned by Lionhart. for example, in one play a hapless victim eats his own flesh and blood (Robert Morley appears as a homosexual critic who is force fed poodle soup...his character didn't have any children and so his two poodles were the closest thing he had to ""family""). Another death came when Price plays 'Butch', a gay hairdresser who electrocutes furture wife, Coral Browne. This film is hilarious and it has two messages. The first: critics DO have power over public opinion and it's often their take on a movie, play, or record album that often persuades the public into investing their time or money into something. Second: no matter how personal and how awful a review might be, the offended party shouldn't kill his/her attackers. Ignoring bad reviews and denouncing the critics as dummies is the proper way to handle pious critics. Seek out this film and enjoy Lionhart's happiness in getting his revenge.

Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, Richard III, Henry VI Part I, Othello, and The Merchant of Venice all come into play.  The best murder is from Titus Andronicus, to which Robert Morley succumbs, in a manner that simply has to be seen to be believed.  One of the nasty fates in King Lear is reserved for chief critic Ian Hendry, as the piece de resistance  -  who manages the last laugh himself, in an unforgettable parting line.
Lovers of mysteries, horror films, macabre comedies, Vincent Price movies, or Shakespeare plays will have the time of their life with this one.  So will any actor, who won't be able to resist a morbid chuckle at the skillful dispatch of so many nasty, obnoxious critics.",1024790400,4,1676,4.866197183098592
405473,4,6301977270,"Vincent Price was the obvious choice for this tongue-in-cheek horror movie, about an aged Shakespearian actor, who exacts revenge on those who gave him bad ""notices"".  An all-star cast brings credibility to a first rate movie, produced to give it a ""B"" movie slant.  The soundtrack is sumptious, and the dialogue very entertaining.
I first saw this at the drive in theater where I live, at the impressionable age of 10.  Although I don't recommend this movie for a 10 year old (for the somewhat intense gore); at the time, we didn't realize it was such a movie. It was over ten years later that I actually saw it on German television, then promptly picked it up on VHS, later to be replaced by DVD.
I've watched it over and over again, and do so, for the admiration of the venerable Vincent Price, and the unique story that captures the complexity of Shakespeare with the fun of late night horror.

405474,2,6301977270,"Let's face it, some of these old Vincent Price movies are fantastic (especially his work with Roger Corman), but does that make any Vincent Price horror a classic? No. This was the mid-1970's, by which time the great B-movie tradition of Hammer Horror /Roger Corman /etc. was in its death throws (see 'The Beast Must Die' for a similar case of a film's atmosphere being destroyed by 1970's filming styles).
I think for example that it would take superhuman forgiveness to rate the Dr Phibes movies as actually good, rather than just dated and bizarre. They're funny to recall, but mind-bogglingly boring to wach. Although Theatre of Blood is not nearly as slow paced and cheesy, it suffers from a lack of authenticity (and creativeness) that B-rated sets and actors created in so many movies of the '50's and '60's. The acting here no longer has that 'B-rated OTT' quality (viz House of Usher), and is not yet capable of being either genuinely frighening (Texas Chainsaw Massacre of the same year), or even having the tongue in cheek self-mocking humour that so many horror films would subsequently contain. Slaughterhouse (1987) comes to mind, though the genre is full of examples of this which date back to the late '70's. This movie is therefore somewhere between the object of a satire and the satire itself, and doesn't have the real charm of either.
Robert Morley, who is generally good for a camped up laugh, seems uncomfortable playing the pink-shirted bepoodled (and coiffured) 'bachelor' role here, and basically throws the role away. Diana Rigg does the same. Price seems to enjoy the script, and in fact delivers a very touching death scene in front of his critics. His performance (those familiar with the movie will see the irony of criticising his performance!) is camp but lacks the true feeling of stature which made him excellent in so many other projects (e.g. in Tales of Terror).
Like Dr. Phibes, this film has a faded charm and a strong sense of the typical gloomy '70's resignation: hippy clothes and sad faces. If you like that sort of morbid lifelessness, or if you'll buy absolutely anything with Vincent Price in it, then you'll probably like this film. It does not, however, have much of the charm of those 'great old movies' from a little earlier on that are so fun to watch, and which are so atmospheric.
Still, it's a clever idea, a good script for what it is, and is interesting to watch - once.

In comparison to Phibes, this film is far more gorey and Price's motive makes far more sense (the victims did actually do him wrong) making him more of a anti-hero.  Also, the cops are a little less bungling, which forces Price's character to devise more brilliant ways to carry out his murders while getting past the police.  Most of the murders are also far more humourous than in Phibes (although they are also more sickening for the most part).  He also has an interesting crew of helpers.  And you get to see Vincent having fun playing Shakespeare as a total ham.

405556,5,6301977270,"One of my favorite movie themes are tales of revenge.  Perhaps it is because I have felt wrong so many times and would give anything to ""repay favors.""  Another is the systematic elimination of a group of people, with the reader/viewer wondering who will be killed next and how.  Call this second the Ten Little Indians theme popularized by Agatha Christie.
Theater Of Blood evokes both themes, taking the revenge theme of The Abominable Dr. Phibes, also starring Price, further, in terms of gore and violence.  The tale of Edwin Lionheart, a hammy theater actor who seeks revenge after the critics who denied him the Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.  He murders them in the manner of deaths performed in Shakespeare's plays.  To this end, he is assisted by a group of drunks, billed as the Meth Drinkers, who obey their master and relish the killings as much as he.  Vincent Price excels himself in the role of Lionheart and for this, he deserves a positive award of some kind.
Ian Hendry plays the harried head of the Critics Circle, Peregrine Devlin, Diana Rigg plays Lionheart's daughter Edwina, and Milo O'Shea (Duran Duran in Barbarella), plays Inspector Boot.  Other familiar British faces include veteran actor Michael Hordern, Arthur Lowe (No Sex Please We're British, Dad's Army, Bless Me, Father) and Dennis Price (The Lavender Hill Mob, The Magic Christian) in one of his last films--he died the same year as the movie's release.  John Morley, another veteran, plays a critic who is more than a bit camp, never without two poodles in his arms.  Joan Hickson, who plays the wife of one of the critics, is seen here not only thinner but with red hair.  A sharp contrast to her best known role as Miss Marple.  British sexpot Diana Dors makes an appearance, still sensuous.  And Coral Browne, who plays the critic Miss Moon, became Vincent Price's third and last wife, remaining with him until her death in 1991.
Contrary to Maltin's review, the gory killing do not adversely affect the movie in any way.  Okay, the movie is macabre, but there are moments of humor in at least two of the killings.  The first is my favorite scene, involving the decapitation of Mr. Sprout (Arthur Lowe) a la Cymbelline.  He is executed with Lionheart and his assistant playing surgeons.  The rubber sheet placed around When Lionheart repeats his command, to which the assistant finally hands him the basin.  I expected the theme from Dr. Kildare to be played, but even better, some easy listening one expects in a love scene.  Lionheart rolls his eyes and shakes his head.  The head rolls off, causing his wife to scream.  The maid recovers, only to see the head staring at her, eliciting another hysterical scream.  Mr. Sprout's head goes through one final destination, and that I won't give away to the viewer.
 The second involves the aftermath of a killing done a la Othello.  Lionheart, affecting a thick accent, tells the constable, ""Officer, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Saltery is murderin' his wife.""  To which the constable casually thanks Lionheart, who leaves, accompanied by a score of corny shopping mall muzak.  Precious!
The recurring theme by Michael J. Lewis, played adds to the movie's ambience,
One tiny error is the shot of Lionheart carrying Edwina on top of the theater roof in the film's last moments.  There is an close aerial view of the dark-haired scalp of Vincent Price's stuntman.
I reacted to Devlin's last words in the movie in the same way the inspector looked at him.  After all that, hasn't he learned the words Lionheart spat at him during their fencing duel?
""How many actors have you destroyed?  You destroyed me!  How many talented lives have you cut down with your glib words?  What do you know of the blood, sweat, and toil of a theatrical production?  Of the dedication of the men and women in the noblest profession of all?  How could you know, you talentless fools?  You spew vitriol on the creative efforts of others because you lack the ability to create yourselves?""
The above does give credence to the well known statement that critics are failed writers or performers.  Look what Joseph Goebbels ended up as.
In the flashback scene, it is revealed that Lionheart claimed the prize despite not getting it and had crashed the post-awards party at Devlin's house to get the statuette.  Edwina also arrives and brings her father to his senses, (""You're only helping them to hurt you more."") and as he recites ""To be or not to be..."" on the balcony of, the critics mocked him.  The cold-hearted bastards needed killing, all right.  Small wonder Lionheart chose Hamlet as a pre-suicidal soliloquy before jumping.

Vincent Price, my favourite actor since I saw ""Fall Of The House Of Usher"" in 1975, has never really been taken seriously,  because he so often played tongue-in-cheek, yet surely an actor should be  judged by the degree of enjoyment they give you. Certainly his range was  greater than most give him credit for, and he could play it straight, as in  ""Laura"", ""Witchfinder General"" and ""The Whales Of  August"" for example. ""Theatre Of Blood"" gave Price the  chance to turn his ""hammy"" type performance into an art form.  This is EXCELLENT acting by someone clearly in peak form and relishing  every moment and opportunity, and there are plenty to be had. Surrounding  Mr. P. were an assortment of top British character actors. Its well  documented that they were all reluctant to appear and only agreed aslong as  each of the others did, but clearly they too got fully into the morbid yet  hilarious spirit of the proceedings. Vincent Price plays a disillusioned  actor, content to restrict himself to Shakespearian roles but panned by the  critics as a result. When they, not surprisingly, overlook him for an  award, he decides enough is enough, and after a failed suicide bid, goes  totally loopy and commences dispatching these tormentors of his soul at a  rate of knots. The original aspect here is that he kills them in a method  extracted directly from Shakespeare (unless it doesnt quite fit his plans  in which case he merely re-writes the scene!). The opportunity given to  Price to recite passages from these plays is what gives this film its edge,  he does it in such an overboard yet brilliant and memorable fashion that  you WANT him to succeed. Where real-life critics have their only problem,  is that the death scenes are graphically depicted with a surplus of  blood-letting in four of them. Yet it is only the first which is truly  shocking (as Michael Hordern is stabbed to death in the style of Julius  Caesar by a large group of ""squatters"") because as soon as Price  leans over the dying man and utters ""I am well, it is you who are  dead!"" you realise this film is not to be taken TOO seriously and  rapidly get into the gleefully gruesome spirit of the thing. That he will  not get away with it is not a totally forgone conclusion, (I mean hed  escaped justice the year before in ""Dr. Phibes""), but  his demise  in a flame-engulfed theatre is definately the ONLY diappointment in the  entire movie (with such originality throughout, fancy killing him by the  same method as in virtually all his Corman-Poe productions!).

If you are a fan of 'The Abominable Dr. Phibes' then you will probably like this movie. Even though the story is a bit different it follows almost exactly the same formula. This movie pairs Vincent Price with Diana Rigg.

A presumed dead actor, Edward Lionheart, who was shunned for a best actor award is living in the ruins of an old theater. He decides to take revenge on the group of critics that shunned him. He uses parts of Shakespeare's plays as methods for his creative ways of killing off the critics one at a time. Lionheart's daughter is still living and police seek her out. She denies having any knowledge of her father's whereabouts and claims that he is indeed, dead. She may or may not be telling the truth.

Overall, it is a pretty good movie. Somehow I just didn't enjoy it the same way I did, The Abominable Dr. Phibes. Dr. Phibes had a certain charm to it that his movie is lacking.

7819274,3,6301977270,"Vincent Price was the king of horror in the early 60s having just successfully bringing Edgar Alan Poe to the screen with director Roger Corman. To this day those films are treasured by horror fans and used in English classes to demonstrate the transfer of the written word to the screen. After those films Price starred in several other horror films but nothing that was as popular and for a time he did little more than TV appearances.

That changed in 1971 when he came back to the forefront in a small film called THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES. It was followed in 1972 with a sequel, DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN. So it only seemed natural that he would come out with another horror film the following year which is where this film comes into play.

Using a theme that was found in the Phibes films we have another series of deaths at the hands of a madman. This time around the protagonist is Edward Lionheart (Price), a Shakespearean actor who supposedly committed suicide after being shamed by the critics circle. But death was not meant for him yet and he survives with the help of a group of vagrants who become his henchmen/women.

The critics circle is still around and doing well. But suddenly they begin to be killed off one by one. And with each death is some cryptic message involving the plays of William Shakespeare. The initial suspect is Lionhearts daughter, Edwina (Diana Rigg). But top critic Peregrine Devlin (Ian Hendry) doesnt believe it. Of course the rest of us know shes involved in one way or another as weve witnessed her at each murder in disguise, a bit that tried to make the viewer unaware but which we can see through easily.

Each of the deaths of the critics is played for both disgust and humor of the darkest sort. For example one critic, fond of his two tiny dogs, has them fed to him in meat pies. As with Phibes we have her examples of cleverly written murders that are involved in a countdown to the last one. The problem is it doesnt quite work as well this time around.

The fault here doesnt lie in the performance of Price or of Rigg for that matter. Both do a great job here, Price especially. Its one thing to perform a role poorly but quite another to perform it as someone trying to do it justice but doing it over the top unintentionally. The movie just doesnt have the same feel that the Phibes films did even though you can see the obvious attempt to replicate those films.

In the end the move remains a fun horror film to watch but moves along at a much slower pace than the aforementioned films. That does more damage than good here. Price fans will find this a must see if for no other reason than to see his performance. The same goes for fans of Rigg.

The presentation lives up to the standards of all releases from Twilight Time with the best picture quality found. Extras include an isolated score track, an audio commentary track with film historians David Del Valle and Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailer. As with all Twilight Time releases theyve limited it to just 3,000 copies so if you're interested in one order it today.",1508716800,,3093,4.49288256227758

7819276,4,6301977270,"Released in 1973 and directed by Douglas Hickox, Theater of Blood stars Vincent Price as a bitter Shakespearean actor in modern London who is thought to be dead due to suicide. Actually, hes alive-and-not-well and murdering his unrelenting highbrow critics. Diana Rigg plays his understanding daughter while Milo O'Shea is on hand as the inspector.

The score is excellent, even moving, and the first act is quite serious. But then Prices hammy approach and the increasingly unbelievable murder scenarios thrust the movie into black comedy territory. Still, its just serious enough to (sort of) suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Its another take on the basic plot of The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and its sequel (1972). Its also reminiscent of House of Wax (1953), although I give that one the edge.

The jaw-dropping Madeline Smith is on hand on the babe front, but shes unfortunately underused as a decidedly peripheral character. Theres Rigg, of course, if you find her attractive. I dont, but shes likable enough.

The movies colorful like Hammer flicks, albeit with a slightly bigger budget and the corresponding location shooting. Fans of Vincent Price horror and, especially, the three movies noted above should eat this up while others might find it too talky, one-dimensional and overlong.

The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in London, Brentford & Windsor, England. WRITER: Anthony Greville-Bell.
