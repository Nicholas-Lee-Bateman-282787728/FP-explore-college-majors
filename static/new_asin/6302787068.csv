509797,5,6302787068,"Now this, is something that Robin Williams has done much of in his carrer, really two things, 1 Singing, 2 Doing a voice in an animated movie. But this is true good to be true. As Aladdin opens, a vizier named Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) has finnaly found the Cave of Wonders, which I guess, he spend about half of his life, searching for it. But the Cave of Wonders has strict rules, that only the diamond in the rough can go in there, and the other touch nothing but the lamp or never again see the light of day.",1005868800,,511,4.171717171717172
509798,5,6302787068,"I actually liked this movie, on account that i am a horror movie freak. It was a good film about this street rat that fell in love with a princess and he tried to marry her but wasn't aloud and there was a mean guy that wanted to marry her. There was also a geni and he was funny and friendly, there was a onkey and a magic carpet, and this king.......",997401600,,352,3.9027777777777777
509799,4,6302787068,"Disney's ""Aladdin"" isn't as spectacular as some of it's other films like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but it's proves itself to be worthy entertainment for adults and children alike. The dazzling animation and animal characters will provide hours of mockery and cheers from children, while the superb comical talent and witticism of Robin Williams will be a sheer delight to both sets. The movie tickles my fancy in new ways; I loved it.
The story centers around a ""street urchin"" named Aladdin, who'd give anything to live within the walls of the Sultan's palace. One day in the marketplace, he meets a girl who turns out to be the princess, but he is soon arrested at the hands of Jafar, the Sultan's advisor who has a thirst for the throne. Jafar takes Aladdin far into the desert, to a place known as the Cave of Wonders, where he ventures inside to find a magic lamp containing a giant blue genie with a flare for comedy. Aladdin uses the lamp to make himself a prince, in hopes that he may win the heart of Princess Jasmine and finally live in the palace. But Jafar has different plans. Spurned by the princess and annoyed by the Sultan, he makes it his life's goal to retrieve the lamp and become master of the universe.
While this movie doesn't have the grandeur and magnificence of Disney's spectacle pieces, it's clear that it doesn't need that look or feel to make it work. This movie is basically a Disney comedy, possessing a simple story for children while the dialogue will appeal more to adults as well. It's not a very serious film, which makes it even easier to enjoy the comedic lightheartedness it brings with it.
That comedy rests on the shoulders of Robin Williams, who provides the voice of the Genie. Some of his best work is done in this film, and he brings some of the funniest one-liners and gags ever to a movie that works well with them. And since his character is one of animation and not reality, then the possibilities are endless. You'll laugh until you cry watching Williams in action, as he switches many different forms, voices and attitudes.
Everything else for a typical Disney movie is right in place: there's the setting, the Arabian town of Agraba, overlooked by a palace complete with dome-topped towers and sparkling white walls, all with a certain Disney touch. There's the main protagonist, Aladdin, who hopes for a better life and then gets one. There's Princess Jasmine, the maiden whom everyone wishes for their own. And there's the villain, Jafar, complete with talking parrot Iago, who provides comic relief in the midst of his master's evil doings.
I wasn't expecting much from ""Aladdin,"" which is why I liked it so much. Perhaps people expected a bit too much out of it, being a follow-up to ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but in order to enjoy it, you just have to sit back and relax and let it roll over you. The comedy is the best thing about it, and Robin Williams succeeds beautifully at bringing a warm and funny nature to the picture. ""Aladdin"" is laugh-out-loud funny! I loved this movie!",989280000,15,3036,4.644981412639405
509800,5,6302787068,"This is probobly one of the best Disney films out.  It takes you into the world of Agraba, city of mysteries.  You get to live the life of a young begger boy who soon becomes a hero.  The Genie even adds more comedy and entertainment to the story line.  Robbin Williams definitly shows the Genie at his best.  A must have for any Disney loving family.",986083200,,351,4.257575757575758
509801,5,6302787068,"I had heard that this was the first Disney movie that would appeal to adults too. I realised this when I saw it for the first time ... the humour is several notches above what we expect from Disney. This is a breezy and magically animated adaptation of the popular Arabian Nights fable which every kid has heard time and again. Disney's take on this often told tale is simply marvelous. The animation, the background score and the vibrant colours are spellbinding. But the best part about the movie ... the voices !!! Brilliant voice over by Robin Williams for the genie. Only he could pull this off. Also the voices for Jafar and the parrot Iago are fantastic.  The music in this film is enchanting and complements the movie well ... buy the soundtrack Album as it is one of the best Disney scores I've ever heard. I have seen this movie more than a hundred times in the last few years and still haven't got tired of it. My only regret... If only this were available on DVD as I've worn out the tape in certain parts because of repeated viewing. This is a must-see Disney movie and definitely one for your Home Video collection as it appeals to all ages and can be watched as many times as possible without being bored.",985392000,,1220,4.4222222222222225
509802,5,6302787068,"This is one of my personal favorites in Disney animations!  Like the other works of the time, Aladdin is a splendid, Disney version of a well-known children's story, modified and retold to capture all audiences.  The animation is beautiful and the songs (A Whole New World is the BEST Disney song!) are just GREAT!  (I wish Jasmine had more singing parts - her voice was so pretty, but at least Lea Salonga got to sing for Mulan too!  :)  )  I liked this version of the story much better and I can't wait for Disney to redistribute this wonderful classic again!  This copy is pretty worn - like all my other Disney movies.  This is a must-see/must-have for all, even if you're not a Disney fan!  Get a hold of a copy today!!",985132800,2,724,4.383458646616542
509803,5,6302787068,"One of Disney's better ""late release"" animation films, proving once again that the studio can still produce the magic when they've a mind to.

I'm basing this review on the original DVD release in 2004 {original review date July 2000}), however, there shouldn't be any significant differences in the feature itself between releases. Naturally, the DVD will outlast a VHS tape and the quality of both the picture and sound are higher.  Disney included extras on this version (more in the platinum and gift sets, natch) which boast cut scenes and songs. There are some alterations to the film from that shown in theaters, but nothing that will take seriously away from it.

On the movie, it's a great rendition of the tales of 1,001 Arabian Nights (with Disney's own plot and characterizations) which will entertain members of the entire family. Robin Williams does an exceptionally fine job as the voice of the Genie -- giving him comic personality and wit.

The story line is a good one and is followed by two 'add-on' sequels ('Return of Jafar' and 'King of Thieves'), both worth purchasing and are now available (Williams is missing from 'Return', but back for 'Thieves').

The film's music is top rate and in line with many of their earlier successful animations (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast).

All in all, a worthwhile purchase for your home library. Children and adults will enjoy this one for decades to come.

509805,5,6302787068,"Aladdin was 1992's biggest moneymaker. Instead of fighting their own standards of a superior romance film like The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, the company tried to open to another category: a comedy. As  everyone can see, the beginning in Aladdin is not as interseting as The  Mermaid's or mysterious as Beauty's. In fact, there are few scenes in  Aladdin such as the narration and other sequences which just don't follow  the standards of animation set by 1989's The Little Mermaid or 1991's  Beauty and the Beast. But the cave of wonders scenes and the rest of the  movie usually ARE impressive and visual. The songs are good, good and quite  memorable. They lack Under the Sea or Belle but still, they are good and  Aladdin won even more prizes than Mermaid and Beauty. Aladdin is indeed one  off Disney's all time favorites. The characters are indeed memoable and  beloved. Jafar is a remarkable villain. Aladdin ends up being a true  classic.",949708800,7,959,4.786585365853658

They altered my childhood movie! Loved it growing up and wanted to watch the original Aladdin, but lyrics have been removed, script changed, and screens altered. Reasons offered claim it is for racist connections... Weird, I never once considered the color of the characters to be a meaningful impact on story. I watched it for the lore and catchy songs. Maybe I am falling behind in the times and I am instead suppose to pay more attention to people's color instead of the story they have to tell. If so, I'll gladly live in the past when a cartoon was simply a good way to spend 90 mins and not a topic for politically charged agendas.",1521158400,8,710,4.461538461538462

510350,5,6302787068,"In celebration of today's 25th anniversary of the release of this Disney favorite, I  give my editorial two cents' worth on this colorful piece.
  We find ourselves in Ancient Arabia where a darkly villainous grand Vizar named Jafar(Jonathan Freeman), along with his obnoxious  sidekick pet parrot, Iago(Gilbert Gottfried) hold influence over the Sultan (Douglas Seale), a widower trying to get his daughter, Jasmine (spoken by Linda Larkin, and sung by Lea Salonga) to marry any of the Princes from surrounding Sultanates.
 But the girl is unhappy, and finds comfort in her isolated life with her pet tiger, Rajah, (Frank Welker), until one day, she disguises herself as a commoner and escapes the palace, where she meets the street urchin Aladdin( Scott Weinger) eluding the law with his pet monkey, Abu(also voiced by Welker), because he is an impoverished orphan struggling to survive.
 Jafar  has visited the Cave of Wonders , and discovered a prophecy about a magic lamp, whose genie's master with be ""A diamond in the rough"", who will ultimately rule the kingdom, and he plots to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled.
  Aladdin and Abu ultimately arrive at the Cave of Wonders, led there by Jafar incognito, where they are trapped and imperiled. But aided by an ancient magic carpet, they discover the lamp, and escape with it, as the true adventure begins.
 While Weinger voiced the title character, inevitably, this is Robin Williams' show. At the time of the film's release, one commentator noted that the animation of the Genie as various personalities Williams voiced throughout the film, allowed people to see""...what goes on inside Robin Williams' head"", adding, ""...And that is a scary thought!""
  Scary, but of course, it is the fuel that makes the engine of this movie run.
 Aladdin and the Genie develop a rapport as  Aladdin is granted three wishes--only three, and no more.
 The Genie reveals that he years for release from servitude, and the two evenutually establish his relationship with Jasmine, initially under false pretenses, and the young lad and his royal sweetheart travel the world in one night on a magic carpet ride, as the score by Alan Mencken reaches its zenith with the song, ""A Whole New World"".
  A dangerous interlude with Jafar threatens their happiness, as well as that of the entire sultanate. But Aladdin's street smarts as well as Jamine's cleverness and the Genie's intervention, turn the tide of events in their favor.
  Williams' maniacal schtick truely made him the comic relief of this classic, and it was captured in cartoon form magnificently.--A legacy of which he and all those involved, can be very proud!",1511568000,,2665,5.04337899543379

511235,5,6302787068,"This has got to be the all-time best, most magnificent Disney movie ever. I first encountered this masterpiece as an adult in my late twenties, maybe a couple of years after its initial release, and I was immediately smitten.
This animated film is pure musical, visual, and comedic joy. The characters are a delightful blend of stereotype and familiar folktale. Im sure todays political climate would put the kibosh to this gem from the get-go. Not that its release in 1992 didn't raise a few eyebrows.  In fact, the opening songs lyrics were changed right after its initial release because of complaints by Arab-American groups decrying racism. They successfully convinced Disney to change the lyrics in the opening song.

Behold: the offending lyrics to Arabian Nights:
Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam.
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
Its barbaric, but hey, its home.

The offending lines were changed to:
Where its flat and immense
And the heat is intense

This brilliant number is belted out by a nomadic merchant astride a camel. When the song ends, the peddler is voiced by Robin Williams, providing our first whiff of the comedic genius who is just getting warmed up to voice Genie. From there we enter the familiar tale and are introduced to the evil perfection that is Jafar, and his evil sidekick, an obnoxious bird named Iago (Gilbert Gottfried). Could you die from such a surprise?

To be sure, the Arab-American groups didn't care for the violent stereotype. Frankly, I don't get why they bothered to straighten out this whole ear cutting business at all, considering that by scene four our Protagonist (Aladdin) is threatened with the amputation of both hands for stealing a loaf of bread.

So why all the furor over a little ear cutting? Did the Arab-Americans leave the theatre during the opening song and miss the (albeit implied and threatened) carnage to follow? Maybe it was just harder to convince Disney to remove the hand chopping and beheading bits. After all, we first meet Aladdin running from the authorities after he steals a loaf of bread (Stop, thief! Ill have your hands for a trophy, street rat!). A delightful vaudevillian chase follows, and scimitar wielding goons chase Aladdin through the streets, attempting to behead him. Its a damn good thing they don't  take his head, because he uses it to avert another amputation in scene 10:

 As Princess Jasmine (in disguise, mind you) is walking past vendors and merchants through the streets of Agrabah, she encounters a hungry waif. She reaches for an apple and hands it to the child but is immediately confronted by a scary man in a fez who hisses,

you better be able to pay for that.
pay? our sheltered princess in disguise responds.
no one steals from my cart! he says as he grabs her arm

Princess Jasmine attempts to appease the peddler with an apology. Unfortunately, this only serves to confirm his suspicions and out comes the dreaded scimitar.  He raises the weapon, holds her arm down then asks her if she knows the penalty for stealing? Well, we all know what that is by now, don't we?

Soon afterward, just as it looks like this monster is about to have her hand, Aladdin provides a distraction. He is later rewarded for his good deed by imprisonment. Jasmine inquires after our hero, and Jafar (in villainous perfection) takes great pleasure in telling Princess Jasmine the boys sentence has already been carried out: Death, Jafar elaborates, by beheading.

 Clearly, the Arab-American groups played a high-handed role, as it is obvious that no one in this animated film will be executed by ear cutting.

In conclusion, political correctness aside, this film is an absolute blast to watch at any age. With its starry desert, flying carpets, opulent palaces and treasure caves, who could resist it? Add a hero, a princess, and a magic lamp filled with phenomenal cosmic power in an itty-bitty living space and youve got the makings for an unforgettable animated experience, and let's not forget the soundtrack: Aladdin won a Grammy for best musical album for children, so just try not singing the addictive songs. Good luck.

Aladdin is undeniably one of Disneys best animated films, not just for its epic entertainment, but as a reminder of all the romantic notions we once cherished about the Arab world. Enchanting entertainment, intoxicating imagery, a treasure from the past. 5 zillion stars.",1500508800,,4459,4.876984126984127

512093,5,6302787068,"Aladdin was one of my favorite Disney's animations growing up.  The comedic genius of Robin Williams paired with vibrant backgrounds, and strong female character, adventure, magic, and a fantastic soundtrack... this movie had it all.  It stands the test of time as well continuing to please children and adults of all ages.  This a a fun adaptation of the classic tale from 1001 Arabian Nights (though it deviates extensively from the source material).

As much as I love this movie however, it should be noted that it does have some slightly racist/bigoted/offensive stereotypes about Arabs.  It's original opening song was the worst of those offenses but was changed prior to release on home media.  While that song is no longer heard in the movie some of the other stereotypes remain.  The fun and entertaining nature of the film and all it's good points far out way the few negative representations in my opinion though so I still give it 5 stars.",1487980800,,951,4.869565217391305

Aladin is a timeless movie by disney and is one of the old guards finest. It has moments dark and frightening to the snowflake generation but loved by older generations. Pepe would approve.
Some of the other old guard greats, beauty and the beast, little mermaid, lion king.
In musicology these are full musicals versus say jungle book and snow white which have more jingle based tunes like mary had a little lamb versus full blown professional songs.
And the voice actors are by far a thousand times better in older disney movies versus say princess and the frog.",1483920000,2,661,4.706896551724138

512581,5,6302787068,"The Diamond Edition Blu-Ray edition of Disney's ""Aladdin"" is a great addition to your Disney collection.  Along with the movie itself is a whole host of extras, including those that were from the original DVD release.  As a musician, I really appreciated the 2004 documentary ""Alan Menken: Renassaince Man"" and how it detailed out Menken's role in completely reshaping Disney cartoon films from The Little Mermaid through Hercules (which was the last movie he had done the music for when the original DVD release of Aladdin was done in 2004), as well as the behind-the-scenes discussions on why ""Proud of Your Boy"" wasn't included in the final cut of the film, but was eventually put in to the Broadway musical (which is discussed in the new Blu-Ray Bonus Feature: ""Aladdin: Creating Broadway Magic"").

Also, included in this Blu-Ray release is a tribute to Robin Williams and all the many characters he referenced/ impersonated in his role as The Genie.  Definitely a great thought on the producers and execs at Walt Disney to do that, since this edition was released about a year after Robin Williams' death.

In addition, as discussed slightly above, the Blu-Ray featurette, ""Aladdin: Making Broadway Magic"" is a behind-the-scenes look at how Aladdin made it to the Broadway stage, the changes they made to the music and presentation of the story, as well as the struggles they had with making this musical a success.

If you like the music of Aladdin but don't currently own it on Blu-Ray, this is a must have for your movie library!",1482451200,,1537,4.892307692307693

512611,4,6302787068,"It's not my favorite movie, but I've rewatched it once and it was enjoyable. The animation is great - I don't like it as much as I like the animation in Pocahontas or Sleeping Beauty, but it's better-looking than Beauty and the Beast. The songs are catchy, though I'm not crazy about any of them. Aladdin is a great guy, smart, resourceful, kindhearted, but flawed, and the movie handles his overcoming of his faults very well. The friendship between Aladdin and the Genie is probably one of the best Disney has offered. It's sweet, selfless and adorable.
Now, I wasn't really into most of the comedy from the Genie - most of it went over my head, TBH. Also, Jasmine was stunningly beautiful, but annoying, rude, and a hypocrite, deceiving people about her being a regular person so she could get by, but flipping out on Aladdin and even physically attacking him because she thought he was doing the same thing. She also blew Aladdin off at first just because he was wealthy and attractive. She could just be arrogant and unlikeable.",1481932800,,1033,4.681318681318682

513270,3,6302787068,"Tier 2 Disney fare, much more in the mold of Tarzan or Hercules than Mulan or Beauty and the Beast. It is better than the latter two titles. The tale is basic Arabian Nights stuff, with no really big twists. The character tend to be 2 dimensional. Oddly, my favorite was Iago the Parrot. While Robin Williams voice performance is plenty funny, the Genii character doesn't even get past 1 dimensional. There was only 1 standout animation sequence, and the rest is choppy, ranging from kid-vid to just alright. But while I found the title faulty, it did manage to hold my attention. Your kids will probably play this until the paint wears off the Blu-ray. If I could I probably would rate this 2 1/2 stars for Meh. Robin Williams, especially his non-genii performance at the beginning of the flick, prompts me to round up to 3 stars. Purchase this to round out a collection, otherwise just rent it.",1474934400,,896,4.60625

513272,5,6302787068,Aladdin is simply one of the best Disney films of all time. It's easy to praise Robin Williams' voice of the Genie.  In my opinion his finest entertainment work. A wonderful innocent love story. A beautiful Middle Eastern princess.  A hero from humble beginnings. Such great characters too...lovable fiesty Abu. Magic Carpet! A ruthless villain in Jafar. And his hilariously wicked parrot sidekick Iago voiced perfectly by Gilbert Godfried. I saw this movie with my mother in the theaters as a younger grown man and loved it then. I carry on the tradition of sharing the good ones with my little girl.  This one is amazing.  Don't miss out before it goes back into the vault,1474848000,,674,4.7844827586206895

Robin Williams's dizzying and hilarious voicing of the Genie is the main attraction of Aladdin, the third in the series of modern Disney animated movies that began with 1989's The Little Mermaid and heralded a new age for the genre. After a sultan (Douglas Seale) gives his daughter, Jasmine (Linda Larkin), three days to find a husband, she escapes the palace and encounters the street-savvy urchin Aladdin (Scott Weinger), who charms his way into her heart. While the sultan's Vizier, Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), weaves a spell so that he may marry Jasmine and become sultan himself, Aladdin discovers the Genie's lamp in a cave, rubs it, and sets the mystical entity free, leading the Genie to pledge his undying loyalty to the dazzled youth. Aladdin begins his quest to defeat Jafar and win the hand of the princess, with the Genie's help. Monsters, Disney's trademark talking animals, and a flying carpet all figure into the ensuing adventures, but Williams' Genie, who can change into anything or anybody, steals the show as he launches into one crazed monologue after another, impersonating figures from Ed Sullivan to Elvis Presley. ~ Don Kaye, Rovi",1473638400,3,1219,5.034653465346534

I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Aladdin (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a hilariously-funny movie with quotable lines that you will remember (and use!) years down the road. But underneath the hilarity and memorability, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

I hadn't watched it since I was a child and love being able to have a copy now. We did watch it with our 3 1/2 year old and found that the ending was a bit too scary for her and we had to fast forward. She enjoyed all the fun songs and magic the Genie did as well as the magic carpet. Overall I love this movie.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

516051,5,6302787068,"Aladdin was a huge part of my childhood. I remember being so entranced as a child by entire thing. The characters, the music, the artwork just drew me in. Along with millions of others. I don't think I know anyone who has never seen this movie. And if you have not seen this movie, buy it, rent it or stream it. You won't regret it.

I have so many happy memories with this franchise. How excited we were when my parents first brought it home on VHS. Me and my brother getting the dolls are Easter and being so excited that we took them everywhere for the longest time. Being absolutely pumped for the sequels and I'm talking like bouncing off the walls excited.

This will always be one of my favorites. It's a Disney Classic.

(The only thing I am ""mad"" about is that I thought I was getting the limited edition artwork sleeve but I didn't. If you are purchasing something and really want a certain copy, please read all the details carefully because I would have gone with a different seller had I read more into it. I just saw the title and bought it so it's my own fault.""",1459382400,5,1077,4.295566502463054

516285,5,6302787068,As described,1458000000,,12,5.5
516286,5,6302787068,"""Aladdin"" is a film of wonders. To see it is to be the smallest child, open-mouthed at the screen's sense of magic, as well as the most knowing adult, eager to laugh at some surprisingly sly humor. To achieve either would be something, to manage them both in the same film is next door to amazing.

Based on the classic tale from the Near Eastern collection known as the Arabian Nights, ""Aladdin"" (El Capitan, citywide in two weeks) is the latest animated musical from the Disney empire. But not content to just repeat the pattern of the hugely successful ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" expands both the visual boundaries of mainstream animation and its possibilities for extravagant humor. And it gives Robin Williams what just may be the role of a lifetime.

Williams, the voice as well as the inspiration for the Genie that comes out of a very old lamp with some very big surprises, has more than a decade's worth of film acting experience and two Academy Award nominations to his credit. But he's never had a role that so showcased his genius, for that's what it is, for dizzying improvisational humor, and animation has never had a human partner who so pushed it to its comic limits. Watching this meeting of sensibility and technology is the purest kind of joy, impossible to either describe or forget, simply to be enjoyed.

For the Record
Los Angeles Times Thursday November 12, 1992 Home Edition Calendar Part F Page 2 Column 2 Entertainment Desk 1 inches; 17 words Type of Material: Correction
Williams' nominations-- Robin Williams has been nominated for three Oscars, not two, as stated in Wednesday's Calendar.

But before the Genie is activated, the fairy-tale tapestry (written by producer-directors Ron Clements and John Musker and the team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) must be unfolded. The desert setting is the kingdom of Agrabah, ruled by a benign Sultan (Douglas Seale) with an unusually headstrong and sheltered daughter named Jasmine (Linda Larkin). The law says she must marry a prince, but Jasmine, consoled by Rajah, a Tony the Tiger look-alike, is determined to marry for love and have a life of her own.

Also laden with secret plans is Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), the Sultan's grand vizier. By day the model of unctuous submissiveness, by night, accompanied by his hilariously obnoxious parrot Iago (comedian Gilbert Gottfried), he hatches dark schemes to gain control of the kingdom for himself.

One of Jafar's stratagems uses black magic to awaken the monstrous lion who guards the Cave of Wonders, filled with all manner of glittering worldly treasure and one rather battered lamp. But not just anyone, it turns out, can get into the cave. It must be, the lion portentously roars, ""a diamond in the rough.""

Cut to the city, where that very diamond, given name Aladdin (Scott Weinger), is occupying himself scrambling for food for himself and his pet monkey Abu (Frank Welker). A street urchin who lives by, that's right, his wits, Aladdin accidentally bumps into a disguised Princess Jasmine, trying to escape her unromantic fate. But before things can get too serious, Jafar interferes, spiriting Aladdin off into that cave and his unexpected rendezvous with the Genie in the lamp.

With a tiny topknot and a little beard decorating his otherwise smooth and ever-changing baby blue bulk, the Genie is a matchless shape-shifter, funny from his opening line (""Oy, 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck"") and able to instantaneously turn himself into as many forms (the list includes Ed Sullivan, William Buckley, Peter Lorre, Robert De Niro and many more) as Robin Williams' nimble mind can summon up. With supervising animator Eric Goldberg at the controls, this Genie is also a perfect match for ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali,"" two of the last songs, showstoppers both, the brilliant lyricist Howard Ashman wrote before he died.

Ashman and composer Alan Menken did all the songs for ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but half the lyrics for ""Aladdin"" ended up being written by Tim Rice, responsible for ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita."" Even without reading the credits, Ashman's wickedly clever lyrics are easily told from Rice's bland, saccharine ones, and the comparison makes the void Ashman's death left in American musical theater seem even larger.

Probably inevitably for a G-rated film, ""Aladdin"" does have its overtly sentimental aspects, particularly in the personality of the title character and his earnest, misguided forays into romance with Jasmine. Yet the writers and animators, by filling ""Aladdin"" with self-mocking and contemporary humor, both verbal and visual, consistently undercut the bathos.

This is especially the case for the non-human subsidiary characters like the cantankerous parrot Iago, the resentful monkey Abu and a shy little carpet that is as magical as they come. Creatures like these are a Disney tradition, but never before have they been freed up to be as sassy and no-holds-barred as they are here.",1457913600,,4993,5.032687651331719

516499,2,6302787068,"I LOVE Robin Williams!  And this was supposed to be his masterpiece.

If I'd seen more than just a snippet of him creating the character, that would have been wonderful.  Nothing better than watching a genius work.  But the movie itself wasn't that interesting.  The feminist plot was absurd for that day -- let's teach little girls that a Muslim woman could be independent in ancient whereveritis.  Nice try.  She would have been the quick victim of an honor killing for rejecting the man they'd chosen for her.  Robin had some bright moments, but generally the stuff that made it to the screen were things he could have done in his sleep.  I'll keep it, but it's never going to be my go-to Robin Williams movie.",1455753600,,713,4.595238095238095

Robin Williams is so funny and you can see why and how a whole new genre was created.  He single handily changed these types of movies and made them more than they once were.  It also makes you sad to know that he is gone and when my children ask about the ""guy"" that plays the genie I have to have an awkward stammering conversation.  The movie itself though is fantastic, great animation, music, tempo, humor...it has it all and is a must for any video library.  We have been ordering all our movies lately as digital download lately and I am very impressed with how easy it is and how nice it is to be able to stream on multiple devices and anywhere in the house.",1452902400,14,834,4.085889570552148

516839,5,6302787068,"This Movie, THIS MOVIE, I might be 36 years old, but this movie struck a cord with me when I was 16 and once Blu-ray became a thing I really wanted this movie for it.  I waited until the day it was released again and finally it came back. I've watched it a couple times, once with my Wife and once with my niece and nephew who had never seen it.  Just brought back a rush of memories.  The songs are so catchy, I catch myself singing along to them.  Robin Williams is SOO funny and all the improve he did as the Genie is amazing (RIP Robin).  But the Animations are superb, mixture of hand drawn and CGI, the movie combines them beautifully and makes for 1 epic tale.

If you hadn't seen it, you should.  By the way, it takes place in a FICTIONAL area and city, nothing is real in this movie, I've heard some people give it flack because of the current state of our world in real life, they have nothing in common other than possible styles of buildings and whatnot.

Don't let any of that sway you, it is by far my favorite Disney movie and my Daughter Jasmin can attest to that ;)",1452124800,,1082,4.119047619047619

This movie makes you miss Robin Williams and appreciate his comedy.  He plays the role of Genie and when he breaks into impersonating some of Hollywood's great actors, it is classic. The music makes you want to sing along.  The audience flies along with Aladdin and Jasmine on their magic carpet ride.

517958,5,6302787068,"Just watched Aladdin on Blu-Ray and was completely blown away. It's been years since I last saw this movie, and I had forgotten how truly wonderful it is.

Not only is it a beautiful reminder of Robin William's genius, but it's a perfect example of classic Disney magic. Those of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s remember the ""Disney Renaissance"" - when animated children's movies suddenly became blockbuster sensations. The Little Mermaid kicked it off, followed by the other movies that my generation loves - Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King. They all had the same core characteristics - a loveable underdog, a wonderful romance, an evil villain, catchy musical numbers (that we're still singing 30 years later), and at least one goofy character that made us laugh. The animation was state of the art, the characters were unforgettable, and the stories were completely heartwarming. Like the other movies of that time period, Aladdin is simply magical.

For those wondering about Blu-Ray quality - it's phenomenal. Crystal clear animation with gorgeous colors. I noticed so much detail that I'm sure I never noticed before (particularly in the backgrounds). I'm not embarrassed to say I got goose bumps (and a little choked up) at ""A Whole New World."" Watching this movie was like meeting a cherished friend that I haven't seen in a very long time. I know that sounds ridiculously cheesy, but it's the truth.

I was lucky and snapped this up in a Black Friday Lightening Deal, but honestly it's one I would pay full price for. The new animated movies coming out these days might be fun (and some are very good), but they just don't have the magic of a movie like Aladdin. I highly recommend it for anyone (like me) who's nostalgic for the ""classic"" Disney movies!",1448928000,,1782,4.798045602605863
517959,5,6302787068,"This movie was one of the pinnacles of the late Robin Williams' film career! He did an extremely fantastic job as the original voice of the hilariously magical Genie! Put Williams' hilarious ad-libbings and animator Eric Goldberg's craftsmanship together and you've got an instant classic! In the wake of Williams' death last year, this long-awaited Diamond Edition Blu-Ray release is a worthy upgrade from the VHS copy that I still have, and a perfect way to relive the memories of Williams' sense of humor! This Blu-Ray release also includes the never-before-released Genie outtake reel, which showcases Williams' ad-libs and the accompanying animatics that didn't make the final cut, and hosted by producers/directors John Musker and Ron Clements, and animator Eric Goldberg.

R.I.P. Robin Williams (1951-2014)

The Blu-Ray format recreates the animation well, you can see the lines drawn and even make out individual animation cells. Maybe not what everyone is looking for, but as a fan of Disney animation it's very easy to appreciate.",1448928000,,480,4.925925925925926

It introduces the behind the scenes backstory of the film, showing the musicians, lyricists, and artists that made such a great movie possible. I enjoyed watching them. One brief issue, if you plan on loading this onto a tablet or other device - it takes up A LOT of space.

Aladdin is my favorite Disney/animated movie. I watched it three times the day I purchased my copy! I grew up watching Aladdin on VHS and so I'm very partial to this movie. I also watched the animated tv show and played the Aladdin sega genesis game. So I am very happy about this movie. Aladdin is such a fun character to watch and together with Genie, carpet and Abu, he has many fun adventures. Jasmine is a decent princess, but for me, Aladdin was always my favorite.

518582,5,6302787068,"This movie is a classic. It was one of my favorites, growing up. My husband names this as his favorite movie also.

Robin Williams made this movie great. His voice work and comedy, add so much to the role.  The animation is top notch, and this was before computer took over the animation world. There is only a small part that was computer animated, and it was cutting edge at the time.

This movie is worth watching over and over.  We find ourselves quoting it or singing the songs often .",1447804800,,490,4.351648351648351

518664,5,6302787068,"This Disney classic holds up a little bit better over time than many others, and kids today still love it.  I'm sure most people reading this have seen the film before, so I'm not going to go into an in depth review of the movie itself. I just have a couple of comments on this particular release. First, I have to mention that the tragic death of Robin Williams last year certainly made me want to watch the film again, and probably boosted sales of this re-release quite a bit.  It's sad, in a way, watching his bubbly, smiling character in this movie now, but still good to watch some of his finest work again.

I strongly recommend that anyone considering a purchase of this (or other disney movies) purchase the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack.  It's really a great value, especially for the small price premium over buying on blu-ray or dvd alone.  We keep the blu-ray copy to watch at home, and the dvd copy in our van to watch on the go.  As if that weren't enough, we get the digital copy to stream or download anytime on phones, tablets, computers, etc.

Disney has done an incredible job of making their Digital copy movies available everywhere, in a way that no other studio has. If you buy the combo pack which includes the DVD, and redeem the code inside for your digital copy, you get access to the movie on all of the top digital video services automatically.  Using the Disney Movies Anywhere service, it doesn't matter where you buy your digital copy of a disney movie, you can watch it anywhere.  For example, after setting up your DMA account and linking it to accounts you have on other services, you can buy a disney movie on itunes, and later download/watch it from amazon video on your fire TV.  Or from the xbox/windows stores.  Or from google play. or. . .

My 6 year old loves being able to watch Disney movies any time, anywhere, on virtually any device.",1447718400,,1886,4.4985337243401755

I owned the 2004 platinum edition, loved it, and then when this was announced, I was so bloody excited. The movie looks great, sounds great, and entertains just as good as the 2004 dvd if not FAR better than it. My only gripe is the lack of the 1990s Disney intro, since they replaced it with the new disney intro that was introduced in 2007. I hope that the next Blu-Ray releases don't follow suit with that.

518719,4,6302787068,"This movie is beautifullly animated - one of the prettiest of the later Disney 'flat' animations, and the Robin Williams ""Genie"" character makes this a must-see...with reservations. I know we live in a ""post-PC"" world, where it isn't always fashionable to watch everything you do and say, but this movie is an excellent way to start a conversation about why it might be offensive to some. Probably over the heads of the little ones, as will be a lot of the humor, but 10 - 12 year olds should get why some characters might offend. Disney isn't my favorite, but this movie should not be missed simply for the extraordinary performance by Williams.",1447632000,3,646,4.725663716814159

519389,5,6302787068,"Walt Disney Pictures has finally released ""Aladdin"" on Blu-Ray High-Def. After years of delaying it is finally out.
Plot: A poor boy falls for a princess and befriends a genie who can make his wish come true.

This movie is fun for the whole family and like any Disney film features a star studded voice cast including Robin Williams as the Genie and enjoyable music.

Unlike recent Disney Blu-Rays this one has all the bonus content ported over from the 2-discer from 2004. The only issue I have is the film is in its projection aspect ratio of 1.85:1instead of 1.78:1 or its negative 1.66:1. Guess Disney decided to use a print similar to the foreign film prints.
Highly Recommended it puts your old VHS, DVD and LaserDiscs copies to shame.",1446768000,,742,4.656488549618321

519628,4,6302787068,"Negatives first: I get what they're doing having the whole shiny material slipcovers on this diamond line, but I do wish they'd used the new digital artwork on the amaray case cover underneath the cardboard, or had used less silver. That's a design choice though, and it's all we're getting for this decade's version of Aladdin.
The other negative is that the reunion special/making of feature has been condensed from the 2004 DVD - gone completely are the bits filmed in the theatre with the host introducing everyone and asking them questions. I don't know if it's because it's quite a dry watch, but I'm a little disheartened to see it's not available here anymore. If they'd have left it in, I would have considered this to be the most complete edition of Aladdin ever. Without it all...it's missing something.

Onto the good stuff - the menus are lovely, the Disney Movies Anywhere HD Digital Copy was such a great addition, I was able to claim it to iTunes (the artwork for the file is sumptuous) and there's a good selection of the newer special features available through this too. Really great to have this.
The blu ray itself is pretty great, and I dug the new special features, from the Genie bloopers (which unsurprisingly stole the show here), to Genie 101 hosted by the voice of Aladdin who still seems young, fun and good-humoured after all this time. There's also a special feature, 'Unboxing Aladdin' by a new Disney Channel actor who actually isn't annoying, so there's a win. The other new part is the short doc on the Aladdin Broadway show which I found to be startlingly frank about their past imperfections. There's a lot of teases about the show, to get you to go and see it, so this feature won't age too well when the show isn't available anymore. But it's nice in the now, and let's be fair, this is when most people will see it.

If you already have the special edition DVD (I believe it was 'Platinum back then') then don't get rid of it, because as I say you have a slightly extended version of the special features. But if you want a better quality version of the film and new (somewhat short, but definitely well produced) special features - then I'm afraid you need both versions!!",1446422400,,2213,4.6

If you are a big fan of Robin William (who isn't?) ths has to be one of Disney's finest comedy thanks to Robin largely.
It's a laugh riot once the Genie is released and doesn't stop till the end. In fact.

I've been inticipating this release since I first started hearing rumours about the Blu-ray diamond addition in 2009. A bare-bones inferior version finally did reach the PAL market though strongly lacked the diamond treatment.

This version comes with an upgraded DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track, numerous HD featurettes and all the prior extras from the previous dvd release. It comes with upgraded cover artwork that would be expected of this release, just as it deserves.

Now my daughter has fallen in love with Aladdin as I did. When the Genie first came out and started speaking I started getting all teary-eyed. I can't imagine this movie being the same without Robin Williams. When I watch it in Spanish with my wife I change it to English during his first scene and the song Friend Like Me just to singalong.

I'm here to say get this before Disney decides to lock this one up in the vault again who knows what else they'll change about the movie in the future.

519916,5,6302787068,"This is, quite simply, a great film!

This 1992 film has to be one of the best animated movies of at least the last 30 years. This plot is very good, the animation is superb and the voice actors are perfect - especially Robin Williams! His genie takes this from a top flight flick to a great one! We really enjoyed the extra bits of his genie character. He truly was one of the all-time greats and is sorely missed by all. His ability to improvise was unbelievable. But his ability to show how much he cared for Aladdin was off the charts.

I was slightly disappointed they changed the lyrics to the opening song but it was only one line.

Picture was perfect, colors were true and vibrant - sound was excellent. Price was very good and the Blu-ray arrived very quickly in new condition.

I would rate this a 9.25 to 9.75 out of 10 - I deducted 0.25 points for them changing the lyrics to Arabian Nights but otherwise a perfect animated picture!",1445817600,,945,4.3522727272727275

Aladdin was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid. I remember seeing it at the movie theater with my dad. I had Jasmine pajamas that resembled her outfit, the magic lamp toy... you name it. We loved Robin Williams because of his iconic personality and comedy. To say a person has not been touched by the magic of Aladdin as a kid would be a lie. When you think Disney magic, you often think of magic carpets. This movie is in stunning high definition. Disney really wows me with their blu ray restorations, because you can see a lot of the hand drawn animation stand out like it is calling back to a lost age. The same format wowed me in the Diamond Edition of The Little Mermaid. I love how different each movie feels when in digital restoration. Aladdin is a colorful, magical ride.

The story is about a young teenage boy named Aladdin who lives on the streets to get by with his friend, a monkey named Abu. One day he meets Princess Jasmine, and also encounters a magic lamp containing a genie. The story is about being true to yourself, choosing friendship and one of the first Disney movies to have CGI animation for the magic carpet!

The extras are amazing. Genie outtakes are my favorite and I miss Robin Williams. I felt sad as the movie ended. It hit me just how much of an impact his death had on me, even two years later.

This movie is an amazing add to any Disney fans collection, and I highly recommend it. The blu ray sleeve is sparkly, too!",1445644800,17,1727,4.288343558282208

Our Cinderella combo pack is a good example of how it is supposed to be packaged, so I used that one in the picture along with the broken Alladin case. Seeing them side by side will help you compare. The blue circular tabs in the middle help keep the discs in place and they also help to safely pop the disc out of the case by pressing down on them. Both of the tabs were broken inside the Alladin combo pack. If this happens to you, return it! Luckily ours weren't damaged, but that doesn't make it okay.",1445558400,14,611,4.1

520034,4,6302787068,"While this release is very detailed and looks quite nice, there's a few things I really dislike.

1. The picture is way over sharpened causing ringing/haloing artifacts to be in the video and it's VERY noticeable. This pretty much ruins the image and a lot of things looks like they have a double image or ghost copy of their self along lines.

2. You get slightly less overall picture than on the DVD from the cropping some off the top and bottom to make it 1:85 aspect ratio. (It seems they have been doing this a lot lately, so I'm not surprised and half expected this one)

3. It looks like a watercolor smudged painting over the original, with overly dark and inked black lines. This probly wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so sharp and makes them look kinda terrible.

So they make sure to keep great detail, not screw up the colors or ruin anything else that they typically did in other Diamond releases, but then they screw up these things I listed above.

Overall I rate it a plus and it certainly improves on the DVD when watching on HDTV if you don't mind those 2 things. if those don't bother you or your good at video editing and can soften the picture a little, I highly recommend this Blu-Ray.

The only reason it doesn't get 3 stars or less from me is, I can run this Blu-Ray through a video editor and reduce or remove that nasty looking halo's and ringing in the video and the fact that they didn't seem to do anything terrible to the video that ruins it, other than the over sharpening and possibly the cropping, but that cropping is not what I'd call terrible. Only if it was supposed to be a 4:3 source and they heavily cut it to force it into widescreen would I consider it terrible.",1445558400,,1704,4.326018808777429

So if you want the commentaries and full diamond in rough then platinum dvd is to be kept or purchased isn't that crazy as with Pocahontas release USA and Europe different specials ported from dvd in other words keeping said dvds we get it all so called upgrade to blu ray and we either lose stuff or have to but UK and USA release yet again crazy Disney thinking ok cut the diamond in rough but why not cut those awful green room scenes with that talentless gotfried annoying bloke or the pointless ten minutes on the parrot in pet shop instead you cut the actual. Interesting chat about the production how clever is that?
Other additional, stuff well a bit of Robin Williams stuff was fine but short but the other new stuff was really waste of time and Alan menken Renaissance man well that's from beauty and the beast blu ray
But then two new extras that do make it worthwhile
The nine minutes of Robin Williams outtakes when I heard about this I thought that's a bit stingy and short but I think it must be for medical reason we get nine minutes any longer and heart attacks would increase with all the people who watch this section will literally die laughing it's hilarious.
Then the documentary on stage show also excellent don't know any of those actors but the gut playing genie big guy who'd never tap, danced before this show he was dancing light on his feet with those younger and thinner he really was able to keep, up what a performance",1445385600,,1768,4.376899696048632

This means most sound effects and incidental music mixed to the left and right rear channels will drown out conversations of the characters, which are typically mixed to the front center channel.  During songs, guards and damsels singing are loud and clear (in rear) while Aladdin can barely be heard (up front).  The overall effect is of sitting in the very back of a concert hall with bad acoustics, hearing everything loudly except the principal performers.  For as many years as it took for this movie to come out on Blu-ray, it's disappointing to experience a problem with the audio mix.

520191,5,6302787068,"Aladdin was the first animated movie to gross more than $2 million, and its always been one of our familys favorites. Whats not to like? Its a rags-to-riches story about a petty thief who becomes a prince. Its a love story about a feisty princess who refuses to marry unless she has feelings for him. Its one of the intricately and energetically animated films with music that was produced during Disneys so-called second Golden Age, which began with The Little Mermaid and ended with Tarzan. And its a story about wishes coming true, which is pretty much the Disney brand in a nutshell, isn't it?

Ron Clements and John Musker co-wrote the screenplay and co-directed this adaptation of Aladdins lamp (One Thousand and One Nights). But for all the hype over Disney princesses, Aladdin has always been and will always be Robin Williams film. The late comedian was so perfect as the voice of the big blue Genie that Disney gave Williams top billingthe first major animated film to be promoted on the strength of a major star as one of its voice talents.

Williams improvised roughly 16 hours of material for animators to draw upon and changed so many lines on the fly that the script was denied an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. It remains the funniest animated Disney movie ever, and its mostly because of Williams. Youll recognize Scott Weingers and Linda Larkins voices as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, but Williams makes this world go round.

Theres more, of course, including terrific animation and memorable songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. A Whole New World is the gem in the films musical crown, and anyone whos been to a Disney theme park and seen that now-iconic clip in 3D will remember how romantic the scene is as Aladdin and Jasmine fly over the world on their magic carpet. But atmospheric and energetic numbers like Arabian Nights, One Jump Ahead, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali are also sparkling.

Aladdin isn't as frightening as some animated Disney films, even though there are moments of peril as, for example, when the characters enter the Cave of Wonders to retrieve the lamp. Legend has it that only a diamond in the rough can accomplish the task, and that, as it turns out, is Aladdin.

So theres adventure, but the stage was set for a love story from the first scene when Jasmine, feeling a prisoner in her own palace, first met Aladdin in the marketplace after sneaking out to experience village life. Both hero and heroine are extremely likable, and the villain, while not one of Disneys best, is a solid second-tier bad guy. The sultans advisor, Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), is a Rasputin-like wizard whos played with Maleficent-like relish and whose companion is a wisecracking parrot named Iago (think Othello). Jafar wants the lamp in order to become sultan, and of course hell do anything and hypnotize anybody to get it.

There are thrills and moments of peril that balance the humor and romance, but the closest thing to a PG rating comes when one character is lost in the mouth of the cave, another is threatened with the loss of a hand, and still another transforms into a rather scary reptile. But whats striking about Aladdin all these years later is how contemporary it still feels, how edgy, and how jam-packed full of energy it is. And I really cant emphasize enough how much better the film looks and sounds on Blu-ray. Aladdin on Blu-ray is a must-add to your family video libraries.",1445126400,,3452,4.773869346733668

I saw it at the cheap theater after all my fellow pre-schoolers saw it.  I still remember running for the bathroom during the Jafar snake scene.  Anyway, twenty-years later, and Disney is finally merciful to release enough to release this classic picture on Blu-Ray. It only took ten years after they launched Sleeping Beauty as their first Blu-Ray release and about a year and a half following the tragic death of Robin Williams, who is the star of this movie (no offense to Scott, Johnathan and Linda) despite the fragile frosted state between him and the studio, but none the less, it is here at last.
First of all, like 5/6 of the Disney movies, its totally eye-candy, totally nostalgic, something I love to watch with my younger family members until they get bored (that doesnt stop me though), but there is something about this release that sets it apart from all the other disney HD releases.  And that is the sound quality.
Honestly, when I am watching this Blu-Ray, I am hearing things I never even heard on my old VHS cassette or 2005 DVD copy.  When Genie is released from his confines, you hear the blasts of magic bursting through the lamp like electricity and explosive echo-y sparks.  When the cave of Wonders disappears, you hear the agonizing moans of the spirit and the echoes of following debris so clearly, its like you are falling into the cave yourself.  Its beyond clear that Disney must have spent a serious amount of time upgrading this track, because just WOW!
Seriously though, if you have a yamaha -sound bar, or an Onkyo Surrond sound system and reciever this is the movie you put on for family time.  I guarantee it.",1445040000,7,2081,5.584126984126984

520245,5,6302787068,"Disney has so many classics, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, but one of the greatest is Aladdin with flying carpets, magical Genies, giant talking sand monsters. Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD.

Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.

The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.

Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.

This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!

My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck! I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.

Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.",1444953600,,3108,4.4920353982300885

Many think that the resolution can't be much better than the Platinum Edition re-release, but don't be fooled. I don't know what Disney does to improve already beautifully restored movies time after time, but it really does look great.

On your left is a still from the Diamond Edition in 1080p and on your right is the Platinum Edition in the max of 480p.

On top of being radically enhanced, it's the first (to my knowledge) Blu-Ray release which increases the durability of the disc, which reduces the possibility of scratching which proved to be fatal to DVD's.

Watched with my 3 1/2 year old but she got  scared when Jafar appeared on screen. As for the visuals its a "" whole new world"" , the high definition makes the hand drawings a visual delight. Sadly though I wish they did a bit more for bonus features, especially for Robin Williams. In all its great movie to share with a new generation of kids and to see the lost art of hand drawn animation brought to new heights.",1444780800,,537,4.213592233009709

520428,5,6302787068,"You have seen this movie before, but never like this. The blu-ray transfer is wonderful and breathes new life into a classic.

The audio is 7.1, and with a 7.1 system, you'll get immersive, crystal clear sound that is balanced. The music is fun to hear while the dialogue is never drowned out by the sound effects.

The picture is clear with vivid colors and no compression artifacts. You'd swear this was a recent movie release.

I haven't even gotten to the special features. More features than you could ask for. Also, it comes with a digital copy. You have to use a Disney app rather than having it stored with your other iTunes or Flixster movies, but still having it in Digital HD is a great bonus. It comes with a DVD disc, which is nice but useless if you have a blu-ray player. It's nice that they include it. The case is very nice looking with a glossy, embossed sleeve.

Perfect for anyone collecting Disney movies on blu-ray or as a gift for an Aladdin fan.",1444780800,4,969,4.426966292134831

520432,5,6302787068,Loved it!,1444780800,,9,4.0
520433,5,6302787068,"Watching now as I type, I saw Aladdin as a kid in the theater, and it has been one of my favorite Disney movies since. I can safely say, this new Blu-ray doesn't disappoint.

Aladdin looks great in HD! The standard definition DVD looked good, but suffered from some noticeable compression artifacts when viewed on a 1080p TV, especially in the opening sequence. These issues are thankfully gone, allowing the colors to breathe with vibrancy and less of a ""digital"" appearance. Detail and sharpness are greatly improved; this is easily the best the film has ever looked.

The audio has been upgraded to DTS-HD 7.1. Again, an improvement from the original 5.1 (even if purists may frown upon the fact that the original track is not included). The remix brings a very immersive, organic experience from things like crowd noise in the marketplace to the quiet moments when the music takes precedence. The biggest highlight of course is when the Genie debuts; his powers are a sonic hurricane. There's a reason this film was nominated for Best Sound and Sound Effects Editing at the '93 Academy Awards.

Along with the ""classic extras"" ported over from the first DVD release, we get some welcome new additions that emphasize paying tribute to Robin Williams and the new Broadway musical: There's ""Aladdin: Creating Broadway Magic""; an 18-minute featurette on the creation of the musical production. ""Unboxing Aladdin"" is an overview of some 'Easter eggs' included in the film, and ""Genie 101"" is an explanation of the pop-culture references. Both of these last two are targeted to appeal to children, but to be honest, I enjoyed them. I was born in the 80s, so the Ed Sullivan and Peter Lorre impersonations flew over my head back when the film came out.

The big highlight of this Blu-ray are the ""Genie Outtakes"" - 9 more minutes of Robin Williams improvisations that are pretty funny; we get to see more character impersonations and gags accompanied by animated storyboards. I won't spoil it, but there's an alternate take of Genie after he rescues Aladdin, after he used his second wish that had me laughing hysterically! I presume it was dropped for not being very ""G-rated.""

The results do not disappoint, and I think Disney both fulfilled and exceeded expectations with this highly-anticipated Blu-ray release!",1444694400,178,2313,4.96640826873385
520434,5,6302787068,Still my faveorite movie of all time! Nice seeing the Robin Williams/genie outtakes. Only complaint I had was I had to wait so long to get it!,1444694400,,142,4.296296296296297

520436,5,6302787068,"IT'S FINALLY HERE!

I just got it today, watched it, and the Blu Ray picture was 100% stunningly clear! It includes a DMR/DMA Digital HD code and new and old extras such as never-seen-before outtakes by the late Robin Williams and Disney Song Selection. Strangely though, it didn't include the trailer for the upcoming ""Pinocchio: Diamond Edition"". Though it had trailers for ""The Good Dinosaur"", ""Inside out"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and ""Tomorrowland"".

Regardless of whether you have a Blu Ray player or not, this Diamond Edition combo pack release will send you flying towards a whole new world!",1444694400,,607,5.06

From the packaging to the special features to the vibrant color and sound, I imagine that this is the way the producers and animators intended for Aladdin to look.

When I heard the movie was released on DVD, I did not hesitate to purchase it. The movie is a combination of adventure, comedy, lessons of learning to just be yourself, and romance, with the magic carpet ride being one of the most amazing love sequences Disney has ever made.

The special features are also very enjoyble. Diamond in the Rough is one of my favorites; it goes behind the scenes of the making of Aladdin. There are some games, sing alongs and music videos, including the pop version of ""A Whole New World,"" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle. The are tons of other things on this DVD that are just amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone no matter how old they are.",1443744000,,811,4.370860927152318

The film itself is a masterpiece. It won two Academy Awards for its music and features a touching story and compelling cast of characters. The humor throughout the movie is spot-on, from the antics of Aladdin and the Genie (Robin Williams), to the cleverness of Princess Jasmine, and most definitely the bitingly witty remarks from the main villain Jafar and his sidekick parrot Iago (Gilbert Gottfried.) The entire movie has been remastered digitally with enhanced sound and is presented in widescreen. It is also close-captioned, or you can choose subtitles if you like.

One of the most talked about special features of the DVD set is ""Proud of Your Boy"" --- a song deleted from the movie after it was decided to remove Aladdin's Mother from the story. With the DVD version, you get the awesome music... Read more",1441929600,,1010,4.732954545454546

But i believe one can safely say that nothing beats movies such as lion king(music AND Hans Zimmers score, Intensity of emotions, artwork, theme of growing up)  and Princess Mononoke(
Again Stunning artwork,  theme.......)
Still, it's a question of taste and  i completely understand why there are many people out here who love the movie

520742,4,6302787068,"In the best attempt at emulating the traditions of the studio's all time great features, Walt Disney's ""Aladdin"" recants the tales of the Arabian Nights in typical musical style. The story concerns a young, devilishly handsome Middle Eastern street urchin, Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger) and his desire to be anything but what he is. Desiring to romance the feisty feminist of the royal house, Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin), Aladdin soon discovers himself in a heap of trouble at the hand of the Grand Vizier Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). All seems lost until Aladdin stumbles upon the mythical cave of wonders - a fabulously wealthy cavern inhabited by the fast-talking, sharp-shooting jack of all genies (Robin Williams).

Saddle-bagged with the inheritance of the Disney tradition, directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, are desperately grappling to find either a hit film or, at least, hit song (a la ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty & The Beast"").

520743,5,6302787068,"Aladdin"" continued Disney's hot streak of family friendly but witty animated classics that broke box office records. Unfortunately, the magic was to last for a couple more movies. No small part of the success of ""Aladddin"" can be attributed to the songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Menken and Ashman (who also wrote the winning songs for ""Beauty and The Beast"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors""). Also, the witty self assured direction, like that of ""Beauty and The Beast"", helped define a hip, new Disney that had something for everyone.

So what's the difference between the ""Special Editon"" and the ""Special Edition Gift Set"". Plenty but as to whether it's worth the extra cost depends on how much of a fan you are of the film. The ""Special Edition"" comes only with the DVDs (the featurettes and documentaries are discussed below).

Plus this is a representation of when Disney made great animated films, and not the vehicles to sell merchandise like the film's they make nowadays.

The deal is, I need you Amazoners to tell me, OK?
I'm going to say something that will tick off a few of you, and delight others: Since 2009 I have lived in an America that bears less and less resemblance to those who grew up in this incredibly great country in the early to mid-1960s, as I did. Amongst the most grating differences is this notion of political correctness. The United States of Apologies [for what??] Most especially,The United States of Let's Not Say, Do, or Sell Any Product That Might Offend ANYONE, especially Muslims. What utter nonsense! After all, who attacked us on 9-11 for no reason?
Also, is there a Constitutional Guarantee against Being Upset? Our cherished Bill of Rights certainly makes no such promise. To do so would violate our most cherished First Amendment freedoms. For over 200 years, this was understood.
And, lest we forget, ""Aladdin"" is an ancient folk tale in which most of its characters are Muslim. The story was only discovered in the the 1700s, when life was brutish, and short, to put it mildly!
Disney, *IF* they change this film, seems to have fallen into the PC groupthink. After all, there is no limit to the guilt felt by liberal whites!
If any of you know me through my reviews, you know two things:

521119,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is an animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 31st the 31st animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and part of the Disney Renaissance era wherein several animated films were released. This was based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights and it features the voices of Scott Weinger, Jonathan Freeman, Robin Williams, Linda Larkin, Frank Welker, Gilbert Gottfried, and Douglas Seale.

After a sultan gives his daughter, Jasmine three days to find a husband,she manages to escape the palace and encounters the street- savy urchin Aladdin,whom she fell in love with. Meanwhile,the sultan's Vizier,Jafar,weaves a spell to be able to marry Jasmine to fulfill his ambition of becoming a sultan himself. Later,Aladdin discovers a lam in the cave that contains the Genie,who pledges his undying loyalty to him. This begins Aladdin's quest to defeat the evil forces of Jafar and ultimately win the heart of Jasmine.

This was definitely a memorable entry of Disney among its list of classical animated features. It contains wonderful songs such as ""A Whole New World"" and great voices especially that of Robin Williams as the Genie. No doubt that it will be one of the most unforgettable animated film for children and it remains entertaining and a joy to watch as this review is being written.",1433203200,,1440,5.046218487394958

521624,3,6302787068,"This was a very popular movie in 1992, based on the Arabian Nights tale. Aladdin meets Princess Jasmine, finds a genie lamp and gets 3 wishes. Unfortunately, the villain Jafar has other plans. I liked Aladdin and Princess Jasmine very well, but the Arab villains were annoying and seemed like negative stereotypes. ""A Whole New World"" is the best thing about this movie. Robin Williams was no doubt very talented, but he was just too much as the genie; this character seems like he was created for boys with ADHD and was the worst part of this movie, and the reason I only give this movie 3 stars. Plot is too complicated and all over the place to explain here; simply watch it and judge for yourself.",1421625600,,701,4.52755905511811

521724,4,6302787068,"It's weird, but most of the characters in this movie have trouble with the truth, misrepresenting themselves as something other than they really are.  Everyone is trapped in some regard, desperate to break free.  The genie wants to be liberated, Aladdin wants to be anything but a street rat, Jasmine wants out of the palace, Jafar wants to stop scraping and bowing to a nitwit Sultan who only wants to play and marry off his daughter as quickly as possible.  Abu wants to be fed and loves to steal (whatever he can).  Wishes seem to be the answer to everyone's problems.
In spite of the fact that he shows up late, this is Robin Williams movie; as the genie he handily overpowers all the other characters, including the flamboyant villain Jafar (Jonathan Freeman).  The songs are nice but there should have been more (most were cut out).  This movie was also fraught with no end of controversies and behind the scenes melodrama (mostly due to then Disney president Jeffrey Katzenberg who forced script rewrites and engendered a lot of bad will, especially where Robin Williams was concerned).  It's a miracle this movie was ever made and became a huge hit; winning Oscars and critical acclaim.",1417910400,,1194,4.795121951219512

521739,5,6302787068,"Like me, the fact that Disney has Aladdin in the ""Disney Vault"" (I'll refrain from giving my 2 cents on that marketing trick) is likely what lead you here. I was looking everywhere for Aladdin to share my experience of this great movie with my son.

Has the image kept up with today's HD Resolution?
The HDquality of this Blu-Ray is superb. I was worried that the quality would be poor on an HD (1080P) display but it looks great, almost as if they remastered for HD.

Does this work in the U.S.?
I was heistent on buying this version in the U.S. but it works great on my PS3. Great Disney Villians sleeve as well.

Digital HD (Digital Copy)?
Unfortunately this does not come with a digital copy. From my research it appears that Disney has yet to release Aladdin digitally on any of the major platforms (iTunes, Google Play, Vudu).

Disney Movie Purchaser Tip:
If you're building your digital library try looking for a Disney Blu-Ray which has Disney Digital HD (Digital Copy) and buy that vs. buying from your preferred digital store (iTunes, Google Play, Vudu). The Blu-Ray will likely have better Extras and higher quality sound (e.g. 7.1 is rarely available on internet movie lockers like iTunes). Disney recently released an app named ""Disney Movies Anywhere""; it's available on iOS + Android as well as Web. The great thing about the app is it lets you buy/redeem a movie once and it'll add the HD rights of the movie to iTunes, Google Play AND Vudu.

I've found the pricing for Disney Blu-Ray with Digital HD being the same or nearly the same as buying it from iTunes / Google Play / Vudu.",1417824000,2,1597,4.56993006993007

This is the European release of the Bluray.  Disney goes all out when it releases a bluray by providing digital copies, DVD versions, and a feature packed BD disk.  This is pretty barebones.

The quality of the film is good.  It has a clean picture and looks great on HD.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ALADDIN is an animation film of beautiful magical wonders. To view it, it is like going back to your earliest childhood, which makes you open-mouthed at the screen's sense of wonder and magic, where most knowing adults, eager to laugh at some surprisingly sly humour it has to offer. To achieve either is an amazing total wonderful experience that makes you have a grin from ear to ear.

Based on the classic tale from the Near Eastern collection known as the Arabian Nights. But not content to just repeat the pattern of the hugely successful Beauty and the Beast, ALADDIN expands both the visual boundaries of mainstream animation and its possibilities for extravagant humour, and gave Robin Williams his role of a lifetime. Robin Williams, the voice as well as the inspiration for the Genie that comes out of a very old magic lamp with some very big surprises. But Robin Williams's never had a role that so showcased his total comic genius, for that's what it is, for dizzying improvisational humour, who so pushed it to its comic genius limits. Watching this meeting of sensibility and technology is the purest kind of joy, impossible to either describe or forget, and simply to be enjoyed.

The story centres around the title character Aladdin [Scott Weinger] a homeless street rat orphan living on the streets of the city of Agrabah of no consequence. ""Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat,"" he sings as he dodges palace guards while snatching some bread. Like all paupers, however, Aladdin dreams of something bigger in his life. Something that will make his life mean something special. And that something includes being filthy rich. One day, while avoiding a contingent of the local law enforcement, Aladdin comes into a contact with a young girl who is also hiding from the guards. She is actually the Princess Jasmine [Linda Larkin] in disguise, seeking shelter after having run away from home because of a disagreement with her father about his plans for her marriage. The gallant street urchin shows her his favourite place of concealment, and then promptly falls in love with her. Soon, however, Aladdin has more to worry about than the guards or the sultan's daughter. The palace sorcerer, Jafar (voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman), has divined that Aladdin represents the key to his plans. So, in the guise of an old man, Jafar tricks his unwitting victim into entering the mysterious Cave of Wonders, where undreamed-of treasures are hidden. There, Aladdin finds the magic lamp, and after accidentally rubbing it a few times, comes face-to-face with a blue Genie [Robin Williams], who is ready and willing to grant him three wishes. What follows is a basic formula tale of ALADDIN, with the help of his sidekicks, a monkey named Abu and a flying carpet, seeks to win Jasmine's hand, defeat the evil Jafar and his vicious parrot, Lago (voiced with grating sarcasm by Gilbert Gottfried), and save Agrabah.

Only, life inside the palace walls isn't as peachy as Aladdin dreams it would be, which is usually the case with this scenario. Jasmine [Linda Larkin] is deeply depressed by her situation. Sure she's surrounded by wealth, but she dreams of seeing the world, or at the very least, of venturing out beyond the palace walls to see what the real world is like. She's also angry that the law of the land is very adamant that the princess marry a prince, and she's coming of age. Jasmine isn't impressed by the pomp and circumstance, because she wants to meet a real man, living in Agrabah.

With the mixture of Robin Williams' voice and the Disney brilliant animators work, makes the Genie a truly magical personality, stealing scene after scene. Much of the humour comes courtesy of Robin Williams, who deserves, but sadly was robbed with even an OSCAR nomination for his vocal versatility. All-in-all, he does dozens of clever voice parodies which the animators develop into complete, often-hilarious, caricatures. At times, when Robin Williams is in full throttle, Aladdin becomes a ""how many famous people can you spot"" game. Ed Sullivan, Elvis, Arsenio Hall, Jack Nicholson, William F. Buckley, Travis Bickle, Ethel Merman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and so on... they're all there, skewered on the rapier of Robin Williams' zany wit and it is a credit to the other voice cast that they're able to keep up with him.

Even putting Robin Williams' performance aside, there's still a lot to like about this animation film. The animation is almost as amazing as that in Beauty and the Beast, and with the computer-enhanced Cave of Wonders sequence rivalling the lower-key ballroom dance scene in the previous animation film. There are a number of wild action segments that are expertly executed. While the music, courtesy of Alan Menken, plus the late Howard Ashman, who sadly passed away before ALADDIN was released, and the equally talented Tim Rice, who took over the lyricist's duties after Howard Ashman's sad demise, and to the magical experience, there are five brilliant new tunes, three of which features ""Friend Like Me;"" ""Prince Ali;"" and ""A Whole New World"" are total standouts. ALANDDIN can be enjoyed by all age groups. This is a full fun motion picture on all levels, and it is still one of the best fun animation films for pure entertainment.

'ALADDIN' is totally terrific fun, especially watching the comic genius of Robin Williams bring the Genie to life with ihis madcap flare that only Robin Williams can provide, plus of course the great evil genius of Jafar to rival the Genie, so making it an intoxicatingly fun ride with beautiful stunning songs and some of the best animation that Disney has had to offer us, especially when it was originally released in 1992 and remains a Disney classic for all to enjoy, especially with this 2015 upgraded Diamond Edition.

'ALADDIN' animation film has panache and especially exceptional whimsical style, and punctuated with loads of numerous toe-tapping songs. ALADDIN breezes along with exquisite style that doesn't constrict itself to any age group for the audiences. Many single out the strength of Robin William's vocal performance as the key to the animation films success, which earned him a Picasso as well as a substantial fee, the truth is that sometimes lightning does strike twice. Or in the case of the Disney renaissance, four times.

Of special note are the warm, dark tones of the film's colour palette and its playful allusions to Al Hirschfeld's drawings, in the many curving, seamless shapes of the Genie and to Erte's designs, in the angular chic of Jafar. Among the many animators who made stellar contributions here, and I must particular mention the equally talented Randy Cartwright, who has nothing more to work with than a flying carpet, and turns it into a charming new fixture in Disney's Anthropomorphic Hall of Fame. All in all, it is a wonderful joyful adventurous experience.

Blu-ray Video Quality  I've always loved the look of 'ALADDIN,' because it is so vibrant and colourful, especially with this 2015 Diamond Edition. Even when I watched it over and over on the old fashioned VHS format, I remember being blown away by its stellar animation. I'm glad to report that this upgraded transfer depicts ALADDIN' in all its Technicolor glory, and stays true to the Disney perfectionism that we've become accustomed to. I don't ever remember seeing ALADDIN' look this clear. Colours have a bit more life than they did on the inferior DVD. Colour fills never waver in transparency. Lines are crisp, and the artwork really shines. Black areas are sufficiently dark. There is no noise to report. It's all as clean as you'd expect it to be. This 2015 Diamond Edition is an awesome exceptional transfer for a much beloved animation film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  ALADDIN' now gets gets a stunning upgrade to 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix. There is a ton to love to be had here. The rear channels are alive with lots of activity. When Aladdin comes marching into the streets of Agrabah with his parade the ambient sound is perfectly placed. Musical numbers are belted out with force and clarity. Low-end sounds are wonderfully presented. When the Cave of Wonders bellows its dire welcome to its visitors, and the sub-woofer shakes with rumbling bass. The fight with Jafar at the end is a perfect example of the deft directionality on display here. When he turns into a giant snake he can be heard slithering in and out of one channel after another and are tremendously effective. Dialogue is always clear. Robin Williams' voice throws itself all over the place as he appears here and there with different voices and accents. Nothing ever gets muddled. Alan Menken's beautiful score fills the soundscape and provides a wonderfully memorable experience. The highlight of the soundtrack for many will be the immensely memorable songs, composed by Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for which the film won an Academy Award, along with the signature track ""A Whole New World,"" which deserved to be won at the Academy Awards for Best Song.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Producer/Director John Musker, Producer/Director Ron Clements and Co-producer Amy Pell: At the start we are introduced to John Musker, Ron Clements and Amy Pell and tell us it is now well over 10 years since they all viewed ALADDIN and that this is the shorter version from the original concept outline. They talk fondly about the massive talent of Robin Williams and all the fun they had when he did the many hours of recordings that sadly a lot had to be left out. When you see the Prince walks out of the Palace with a hole in his pants, and see his underwear, well when you see Raja the tiger with part of his pants in his mouth, the heart design would not have happened in reality, it would have just been part of his pants, but was done for effect. We hear lots of technical details when Jafar turns into a massive snake. We are also informed that when the Genie is set free, there was talk of showing a wedding. All in all this was quite an interesting audio commentary, but sadly too much overload with technical details, that with most people will go right over their heads. But all three admitted that had a wonderful time being involved with ALADDIN, as well as praising all the other people that were involved with the project.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Supervising Animators Andreas Deja, Will Fenn, Eric Goldberg and Glenn Keane: Once again like the previous audio commentary, we get introduced to Will Fenn, Eric Goldberg, Glenn Kean and Andreas Deja. When the credits come up for Alan Menken, they all have a good laugh when Eric Goldberg mentions that Alan Menken has done a lot of stuff for Disney and that he is an up and coming composer. They all of course have a great affection for Robin Williams, as well as talking in great detail with the character of Jafar and trying to give the impression of his hands were like spiders legs, as well as all the other characters in the animation film. They also mention about the Caves of Dreams and how that was one of the other first computer generated effects ever produced, as well as mentioning about the rendering design on the magic carpet as well. They also mention about Jasmines clothes in making them look simple, as well as praising Jonathan Freemans voice for Jafar, and Frank Welker in his wealth of different voices he can produce, especially with regards to the different animals he produced in ALADDIN. They talk about how the word Applause came to be put on the Genies head, well it was all down to Geoffrey Katzenberg who wanted people to applause at the end of each song, but was upset the audience did not respond. When we hear Jafar has taken over control as the Sultan, you hear him say in the song read my lips well this is reference to that idiot George Bush Jr. when he said those words with the lead up to the Iraq War and was instigated by Tim Rice. When you get to the end of the animation film, and the Genie lifts up The End Title background, you see in the top left hand corner BG 1454 Eric Goldberg informs us that this is the Background Sheet and enjoyed inserting in, and is a sort of in joke. So all in all this was a totally fascinating audio commentary, that I felt was so much more lively and interesting than the previous audio commentary, because you could tell everyone had fun doing the audio commentary and we also hear a lot more interesting facts about the process of producing ALADDIN and is well worth viewing.

Special Feature: The Genie Outtakes: Outtakes Recordings Brings the Genie to Life [2015] [1.77:1] [8:52] Here at the start of this special feature we get the voice of the late great Robin Williams [1951-2014]. But the main part of this special feature is that we are introduced to Ron Clements [Director], John Musker [Director] and Eric Goldberg [Supervising Animator for the Genie]. And what we get to hear is the three of them talking extensively about the fun they had with the genius of Robin Williams, and they also tell us that he did massive amounts of recordings. But as a bonus we actually get to see exclusive video compilation footage of Robin Williams in action in the recording booth. But we also get to see is a lot of rough animated sketches linked to the multi-talented voice of Robin Williams in action and it are totally unbelievable how many voices Robin Williams can produce. We also get to hear from Ron Clements, John Musker and Eric Goldberg praising Robin Williams and what a warm and generous person he was, and also commenting how shocked they were when they heard the sad demise of Robin Williams and that we have lost one of the true greats of a comic genius, and that ALADDIN is a great homage to someone who brought such joy and happiness into the world of laughter.

Special Feature: Aladdin: Creating Broadway Magic with Composer Alan Menkan and Others [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1 [18:53] This special feature documentary was filmed in New York, especially at the New Amsterdam Theater, where the Broadway Stage Production of Disneys ALADDIN is proclaimed as Broadways New Musical Comedy. Inside the theatre we meet Dareen Criss [Actor] who informs us that the musical ALADDIN nearly did not happen, but also informs us that his heroes are Alan Menken [Composer] and Howard Ashman [Lyricist]. Next up is Thomas Schumacher [President of Disney Theatrical] was informed that the musical would be impossible to be staged. Next up is Jonathan Freeman [Jafar] talks about his initial audition and after a long wait was finally given the go ahead to appear in the ALADDIN musical in 1990. Next up we get to hear from Craig Nicholas [Director/Choreographer], who informs us, is a massive Disney fan, plus we get to meet some of the cast of the Broadway Show, that includes James Monroe Iglehart [Genie] who originally had the ALADDIN audio cassette tape of all the songs, but played it so many times, he eventually wore it out. Courtney Reed [Jasmine] tells us of her hopes and dreams for the future and after seeing the animation film of ALADDIN, wanted to be Jasmine. Adam Jacobs [Aladdin] tells us that he is so proud and honoured to be in the show and especially pleasing the paying audiences. Next up is Chad Beguelin [Book Writer/Lyricist] and Alan Menkan [Composer] who both inform us that new songs were added to the Broadway Production, but also informs us that they premiered the musical at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle and was a total disaster, but with different locations, eventually got all the problems sorted out, so that they could Premier the musical in New York in 2014 and was a massive success and have never looked back and as they say, the rest is history.

Special Feature: Un Boxing Aladdin: Explore Hidden Secrets with Disney Channel Joey Bragg [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [4:40] Here we get to meet the obnoxious nerdy Joey Bragg, who tells us about the hidden secrets that can be found in the animation film ALADDIN. First up we find out that magic carpet was the most computerised part of the animation film and points out the logo design on the carpet is the Cave of Dreams. We also get to see Sebastian the lobster from The Little Mermaid that is attached to the Genies finger. We also get a glimpse of the Beast from Beauty and the Beast where the Sultan is putting all the small animals on top of one another. We also get cartoon cameo appearances of Ron Clements [Director] and John Musker [Director] near the beginning of the animation film. We also get small inserts of the Mickey Mouse ears throughout the animation film, but also when the genie is free, you get to see him wearing a Goofy baseball hat. And finally we hear how Jonathan Freeman who plays the voice of Jafar, has been doing this profession for over 20 years.

Special Feature: Genie 101: Hosted by Scott Weinger [The Voice of Aladdin] [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [3:59] Here Scott Weinger informs us that this is dedicated to the genius talent of Robin Williams and of course all the voices he created in ALADDIN. We also get to see Robin Williams in action, but with several split screens showing the actual animation part in the film. But why it is called Genie 101 as Scott Weinger only shows off about a dozen of the Robin Williams voice characters, so this is slightly misleading.

Special Feature: Ron & John: You Aint Never Had A Friend Like Me [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [5:35] Once again we meet the dynamic duo of Ron Clements [Director] and John Musker [Director] on a park bench, talking about their early days when they started working together at the Walt Disney Studios and their long-term friendship as well. Ron remembers when he first met John, he had dark brown hair and beard, but now it is all white. Their first collaboration was working on The Little Mermaid and because it was a massive hit, had to turn down doing Beauty and the beat as they were so exhausted by the experience. But eventually along came ALADDIN and once again collaborated together to make another massive big hit with the audiences. We also find out that Ron is a massive Star Wars fan and was at the head of the que to see the sci-fi film when it first came out. Anyway this is a really nice little feature and a joy to watch how they both talk fondly about each other and how each other bounce ideas off each other when producing animation films that the other one never thought of. So all in all, this is a very nice touching and thoughtful little special feature.

Classic Bonus:

Special Feature: Deleted Songs [1992] [1080i] [1.33:1] [13:56] Here we get to view the deleted songs that could not be included in animated feature film ALADDIN, and they are Proud of Your Boy [Original Demo Recording]; You Can Count On Me; Humiliate The Boy and Why Me. What you get is a short introduction on why it was deleted and you also get to see very rough sketches of what the deleted song would look like. You have two choices, you can either Play All or watch them individually.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [1992] [1080i] [1.33:1] [5:42] Here you get to view only two deleted scenes that could not be included in the 1002 ALADDIN, and they are Aladdin & Jasmines First Meeting and Aladdin in the Lap of Luxury, and you also get to see very rough sketches of what the deleted scenes would look like.

Once again you can either Play ALL or select each song individually. But as an added bonus, you can actually select to Play Film With Lyrics On-Screen and it is your choice to either click On or Off. Happy viewing folks!

Special Feature: Inside The Genies Lamp [1080i] [1.33:1] [6:13] This is a really wonderful computer generated tour inside the Genies magic lamp, which is a very luxurious accommodation. But with the tour we have Jafars parrot. What you also get is an announcer explaining what each room consists of, but unfortunately the parrot has several run ins with items that attack him, but is also informed that he is trapped for eternity, unless someone rubs the lamp. This is quite an amusing extra and one I know children will love to view.

Special Feature: The Genie World Tour [1080i] [1.33:1] [3:31] Once again we get another wonderful delightful computer generated animation, and again Jafar and his parrot are trapped inside the black magic lamp, where they receive animated post cards from the Genie and showing us the locations and events around the world the Genie has visited with is freedom, which you get sarcastic remarks from Jafar and the parrot on the different post cards, and hoping something nasty would end his enjoyment around the world. This again is quite an amusing extra and one I know children will love to view.

Special Feature: A Diamond In the Rough: The Making of Aladdin [1080i] [1.33:1] [70:50] With is special feature, you get to view Five different sections, which are entitled The Producers; The Music; The Animators; The Voice Talent and Made You Look, that includes contributions from the following talented people like Dr. Ali Behdad [Associated Professor]; Eric Godberg; Amy Pell; Randy Cartwright; Ed Gombert; John Musker; Ron Clements; Terry Rossi; Ted Elliot; Glen Keane; Scott Weinger; Lea Salong; Steve Goldberg; Ed Wexler; Mark Henn, Beth Allen; Andrea Deja; Vera Lanpher-Pacheco; Bill Perkins; Jonathan Freeman; Will Finn; Linda Larkin; Frank Welker; Gilbert Gollfried and Douglas Seale [1913-1999]. Once again you have two choices, you can either Play All or select each Title section, but most important, have fun and enjoy!

Special Feature: Alan Menken: Musical Renaissance Man [1080i] [1.33:1] [19:55] Here we find Alan Menken in his home playing his grand piano and in the process we get to see all the Titles of the Disney animation films Alan Menken has been involved with, which are The Little Mermaid; Beauty and the Beast; Pocahontas; ALADDIN; The Hunchback of Notre Dame; HERCULES; NEWSIES; and Home On The Range. Then we switch to a recording studio with a full orchestra, but we also get to hear lots of praise for the very talented Alan Menken and those contributors are from the likes of Don Hahn [Producer]; Chris Montan [President of Walt Disney Music]; Judy Menken [Mum]; Dr. Norman Menken [Dad]; Janis Roswick Menken [Wife]; John Musker [Writer/Director]; Ron Clements [Writer/Director]; Paige OHara [Singer: Beauty and the Beast] and Tim Rice [Lyricist: Aladdin]. But what I liked about this special feature, is hearing about the prolific career of Alan Menken, especially about his childhood growing up and loving music, but also the darker side of his personality when around 16 years of age he was a rebel, as told by his parents, but of course eventually growing up and finding a purpose in his life, especially getting involved with different musical instruments, but of course eventually finding his true vocation in composing music and writing lyrics. Plus also finding out about all the collaborations from different people to enhance his brilliant compositions, but Alan Menken also gives great praise about the sad loss of life from his long term friend Howard Ashman (lyricist) and is a really fascinating special.

Special Feature: The Art of Aladdin: Art Review with Filmmakers Commentary [1080i] [1.33:1] [8:44] here you get a really fascinating audio commentary from John Musker [Writer/Director] and Ron Clements [Writer Director] who takes us on a guided tour of the vast visual inspirational drawings, designs and paintings that went into the design features of producing ALADDIN. We are informed that there were literally thousands of drawings, designs and paintings that do not get into the final animation film, but despite this, they still had a big influence on how the animation film would look. We find out that the characters that were in Blue, represents  good characters, and the ones in red are looked upon as evil characters. All in all this is a really fascinating special and especially seeing all the colourful inspirational drawings, designs and paintings to help bring ALADDIN to the silver screen.

Special Feature: Publicity: Here we get to view the Original Theatrical Trailer: Aladdin [1992] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:50]. Theatrical Trailer: The Return of Jafar [1994] [1080i] [1.33:1] [00:42]. Original Theatrical Trailer: Aladdin and The King of Thieves [1996] [1080i] [1.33:1] [1:30].

Sneak Previews [2015] [1080p] Disneys Movies Anywhere [00:40]; The Good Dinosaur [1:14]; Inside Out [1:26]; Tomorrowland [00:50]; Anti-Smoking Advert [00:16]; Disney Movie Rewards [00:20]; Disney Parks Promo [00:32]; The Muppets ABC TV Promo [00:32] and Star Wars: The Force Awakes [1:50]

Finally, ALADDIN is near perfect spectacular action animation film. It has romance, a spectacular villain of Jafar and a wonderful sidekick with the parrot. It is extremely funny, mostly due to the spectacular work of Robin Williams as the Genie. ALADDIN is still one of the best animation films that has been produced by Disney, and they say, Bring Home The Disney Magic, and you will with this spectacular awesome stunning Blu-ray Diamond Edition, that has also a totally awesome selection of Extras, that will give you many hours of enjoyment, yes folks, it is that good! Very Highly Recommended!

522151,5,6302787068,"I watched this for one reason only: to see Robin Williams play the Genie. It was a role he was meant to play. I cannot picture anyone else doing it. He takes all of his comedic riffs and puts them into the Genie. One incredible thing is that at long last his motor mouth has people who can keep up: animators! As fast as he was verbally, they did one startling visual change after another in seconds to match him. What a tour de force. I liked the rest of it but I'm not a kid. I watched this for a very specific reason and if you too want to see Williams ""off the charts"", you have got to see him do this Genie. Magnificent!

522365,5,6302787068,"This is my review from tv.com

Aladdin is like almost every film in the Disney Renaissance, it was awesome and one of my all time favorite movies. It had a perfect blend of romance, comedy, fantasy, musical, adventure, and action. The animation is superb.

In addition, Aladdin is one of Disney's greatest heroes. He may not be as strong as Hercules, as skilled in the martial arts as Mulan, has shown no archery skills like Robin Hood, but he is amazingly intelligent and agile. His intellect is what enabled him to defeat Jafar by tricking Jafar into becoming a genie and imprison him in a lamp. He is also pure hearted, giving to orphan children some bread that he had to avoid the palace guards to obtain. However, he is still human and thus was given his flaws, such as his insecurity.

Jasmine is my number 1 favorite Disney Princess, because she wants a life not being in the palace all the time and is one of the strongest Disney Princesses.

A month after Robin Williams sadly passed away, I bought this and saw the behind the scenes look at the film first, something I don't always do. I was amazed at the effort put into the film, including scrapping a storyboard they felt wouldn't work and started again. This is why the film is so great. Effort and that's the key word. They kept working on this film until it was perfect in their eyes.",1410393600,,1350,4.475609756097561

522525,5,6302787068,"Growing up I absolutely LOVED Aladdin, so I had to get the DVD for myself.
The story has a great message, and is perfect for kids!

*SPOILER ALERT*

To sum it up, Aladdin is about an Arabian princess, Jasmine, who falls in love with a poor boy from the streets, Aladdin.
However, Jasmine's father, the Sultan, and his evil adviser, Jafar, try to marry her off to multiple different suitors. All of which Jasmine objects to because she believes that, ""she is not a prize to be won"".
Meanwhile, Jafar is looking for a way to steal the Sultan's power and become the Sultan himself. In order to do this, he seeks out a genie's lamp in the Cave of Wonders. Unfortunately for Jafar, Aladdin is the only person who can set foot into the Cave of Wonders. Jafar deduces a plan to trick Aladdin into retrieving the lamp for him, and eventually becomes an all-powerful sorcerer through the help of genie (Robin Williams). Through some trickery, Aladdin is able to defeat Jafar and free genie from eternal imprisonment. Finally Aladdin and Jasmine are married and live happily ever after.",1409011200,,1076,4.657894736842105

The movie itself was in its own plastic and very well protected. If your looking to buy this movie, and not wait how many more years for it to come out of the vault,  i would highly recommend buying from speedysales. It wasn't a pirated movie by no means. The main menu and everything was original and fantastic!",1408752000,,434,4.425
522573,5,6302787068,"This review is strictly about the movie itself. I confess I don't own it on DVD so I can't comment on the ""extras"". I recently watched ""Aladdin"" on the Disney Channel and found it to be spectacular. I think if Walt Disney was alive to see this film, he would have been proud of it; it's well up to the standards of the best animated features made during Walt's lifetime (Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi, etc.)

Robin Williams is in great form as the genie. Every time he speaks, he goes into rapidly changing comical voices and impressions, while matching animation has the genie constantly changing size and shape to conform to his vocal schtick. Within the space of a few seconds, the genie morphs into Jack Nicholson, Peter Lorre, Groucho Marx, and a squad of cheerleaders, among other things. He momentarily sprouts extra fingers or extra arms when he wants to illustrate some sort of point, then promptly morphs back again; or even removes and replaces his own head as if it were a hat. This rapid animation of the genie is reminiscent of the classic 1940's animation of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett.

Don't worry if you or your kids don't recognize all the old-time celebrities the genie imitates. The impressions come so rapidly that they're still fun even to those who don't get all the references.

As great as the genie is, he does NOT carry the whole movie. In fact, he doesn't even appear until about half an hour into the film. There is still a lot of great material before the genie appears. About five minutes into the film, when we first meet Aladdin, he is scrounging for scraps of food and has just stolen a small loaf of bread. He runs (and jumps from high places, and runs some more) from an army of big, sword-wielding guards, and sings a catchy song while simultaneously running for his life. This scene is packed with fast-and-furious slapstick gags which come so quickly you may have to re-watch this scene about four or five times to see them all.

In lesser movie musicals, the plot comes to a halt for the characters to sing a song. Not in ""Aladdin""; Aladdin sings his song about being ""one jump ahead"" DURING the chase scene.

Because this film was made in the 1990's, rather than the 1950's or earlier, the princess is not an old-fashioned ""helpless female"" seen in older Disney films. Aladdin needs her as much as she needs him, if not more so.

Aladdin is a believably awkward teenager with a self-esteem problem. He loves Princess Jasmine, but believes she won't possibly go for the lowly ""street rat"" he sees himself as. The genie urges Aladdin to be himself and tell Jasmine the truth, but Aladdin initially refuses to listen. Any guy who has ever had a crush on a woman he felt was ""out of his league"" can identify with Aladdin, and can benefit as much as Aladdin from the genie's ""be yourself"" advice. The genie is hyperactive and wacky, yet also sensible and wise. (That's pretty much how Robin Williams was in most of his films, and perhaps to a degree in real life.)

In addition to Robin Williams, there is ANOTHER great comedian who does voice work for one of the major characters. That's Gilbert Gotfried, who is very funny as a parrot named Lago, a friend of Jafar, the film's villain.

Beautiful animation, sympathetic characters, a solid story, an abundance of great comedy, catchy songs and a moving romance all combine to make this a first-rate movie without a single wasted moment in it. It's a great film for kids, but it's not JUST for kids. I would recommend Disney's ""Aladdin"" to anyone of any age.",1408665600,,3548,4.6117274167987325

I looked around. Most sellers have the Aladdin DVDs up for sale for more than $25 which is kind of steep for an old DVD. This particular seller had it listed as ""used"" for $10. I picked that one up and had it delivered. To my pleasant surprise, the DVD was in its original plastic wrapping and untouched. I got a brand new DVD set =) .

522824,5,6302787068,"Finally decided to go ahead and buy this movie on blu ray as it's one of my favorite Disney movies. Since I have no idea when Disney is going to release this in the U.S., I went ahead and bought it from Amazon U.K. Got it for 7.50 with 2.04 shipping. Anyway, I won't bother with the review as I'm pretty sure those interested already have a good idea of what the movie is about. What I'm going to do is just list all the bonus features that comes with this blu ray. First and foremost, this blu ray is region free so you can play it on any blu ray player. That's the most important part. 1. This blu ray has a lot of audio options so you can pick which one you want to watch it in. They include DTS HDMA 5.1 English, DTS digital surround 5.1 Dutch, DTS HDHR 5.1 French, Dolby Digital 5.1 Czech, Greek, Polish, Russian and Dolby 2.0 Ukrainian. The subtitles are all available for the spoken languages and includes English foot the hearing impaired and Slovakian.

The extras included in this set are Filmmakers' audio commentary, the making of Aladdin, sing along with the movie, 2 deleted scenes, 3 music videos and 4 deleted songs.

If you're wanting to get Aladdin on blu ray and not wanting to wait, I suggest you just buy from Amazon U.K. It's pretty cheap and you don't have to do anything as it's just your Amazon account. I but from them all the time as they have items that isn't available in the U.S. The only bad part is they're kind of slow, not the shipping, as they ship pretty fast but it takes about 2 - 3 weeks to arrive.",1404604800,,1537,4.224489795918367

522826,5,6302787068,"Last time I saw Disney's Aladdin was in college on DVD which still looked dated (I'm 25 now) and before that was on VHS as a kid. I've been eyeing this Bluray version of Aladdin for a while now, trying to wait for a good price drop because it fluctuated so much. I was able to grab it for $18!

Aladdin looks GREAT on Bluray!!! I can't believe how good it looks! It takes me back to my childhood--we also had the Aladdin CD growing and always listened to the songs. This is definitely a classic Disney must have.
Aladdin on Bluray is clear, crisp, new-looking, sounds great, updated graphics/animations, everything is perfect!

If you remember watching Aladdin on VHS in the 90's like me and miss this classic, grab it now before it starts becoming insanely more expensive like some of the other classic Disney Blurays! I think I saw the Snow White Bluray going for almost $80 and I had bought it at $25 years ago!",1404604800,,914,4.434523809523809

One of the reviews stated that their dvd player wouldn't play it and that it would only play on their computer and another suggested it was bootlegged.  With this in mind, I played it on my laptop and it played fine--looks good not too bad---except the case.  The case is cheap and obviously not Disney quality.  Or maybe it is just from another country.  I was desperate for Aladdin and Disney hasn't given a release date for the blu ray version :/  So, if you are desperate--buy it.

Some suggestive themes between Jafar and Jasmine however it may be able to blow completely over your kids' head.

UPDATE: I've bought it from Germany. And you know what? It's great and the price was quite reasonable. Why? Well, because I didn't have to pay for the added DVD and an unnecessary digital copy that we usually get stuck paying for with American releases of Disney Blu-Ray's. Walt Disney Blu-ray's always sells you some Disney Blu-Ray on film with 2 or 3 additional discs that you may not ever need or will play but you've got no choice but to pay for it all anyway. Who needs the additional DVD? If you're buying the new Blu-Ray of anything old, it's very likely that you already have the DVD, and you want to get rid of it.  Right?

I've noticed that most countries have already released Walt Disney's ""Aladdin"" on Blu-Ray EXCEPT the United States. I've bought that already so I guess ""The Net"" will be next.

America is letting good things slip right through its fingers. You'd be amazed what you would find selling on Blu-Ray overseas. Just be sure that (if you are in the US) that you get the BD as Region A or Region Free.

I've got about 14 Blu-Ray discs that are still not available in the United States. And yes, they all look totally pristine and high definition sharp.  And, I didn't have to pay for unnecessary additional DVD's in its release.",1396396800,,1513,4.444043321299639

522983,5,6302787068,"I don't usually bother writing reviews, because it always opens a can of worms and reviews can eventually become a boxing match for the righteous. I don't have time for nit picking and nonsense.  However, I wanted to write this one to help others in the US avoid any stress in case they decide to buy this Blu Ray version, as it is a UK import.  Until my purchase arrived, I was unclear, because most reviews of the Blu ray import are lacking in this basic, clear statement: IT WORKS.

So then, I will happily repeat myself for your benefit and will say that, first and foremost: IT WORKS IN US BLU RAY PLAYERS without a hitch! There are no PAL/NTSC issues. Also, as stated in the listing, it contains several languages, starting with the original English, but there is no Spanish (in case this is a concern for you).  Also, just so you know, there is NO DVD COPY with this BLU RAY package.

The video and audio quality are what you'd expect from a US Disney Blu Ray release, so I won't go into detail other than to say it both are excellent.  And yeah, the first song in the film is the edited one we have heard since Disney felt forced to change the lyrics.  I have that VHS version and the CD soundtrack with the original and, while I like originals in most cases, I did not keep me from getting this Blu ray and I am Ok with it.

And while the Magic Code will not work in your US Disney rewards account, sadly, the bottom line is there is no need for you to wait for Disney to decide that Americans are finally ready for the honor and blessings of these wonderful films (I include 101 Dalmatians in this sarcasm) to be released domestically.  You can get them now. I did the same with Dumbo, when Disney kept postponing the Blu Ray release date and when, two years later, they finally did release domestically, I didn't even flinch.  I thought I might, but I did not.

I will post this review as well in the 101 Dalmatians / 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure import Blu Ray page to help anyone trying to decide if they should get that one also.  If you want it, you should get that one as well.

Bonus features are: filmakers' audio commentary, the making of Aladdin, sing-along with the movie, deleted scenes, music videos and deleted songs",1393804800,120,2255,4.353221957040573

523096,5,6302787068,"Disney Studios 31st full length animated feature film Aladdin is one of their best and my personal favorite from Disney's 3rd golden era. Filled with some of their greatest and memorable characters, the exotic setting lends to the beautiful animation. One of the funniest of Disney films with hilarious voice work by Robin William(Genie), Gilbert Gottfried(Iago)and Frank Welker(Abu), Aladdin also is one of the studio's most controversial with a couple of lines of dialogue being altered before and after the theatrical release. There were also some redrawn animation sequences supposedly done for the IMAX showings, but those showing never came to fruition and thus the changes weren't necessary. Unfortunately none of these alterations have been restored in this otherwise fantastic 2 disc DVD edition

The film looks impressive on this DVD set, but I have to wonder why this film hasn't been re-released to Blu Ray? (At least in the U.S.) It's certainly one of their most popular titles and it hasn't seen a new release to home video for a number of years now. I can only hope that it is because Disney wants to make the Blu Ray as spectacular as this DVD was coming from VHS. The film looks and sounds fantastic with vivid colors and explosive sound. The color palette is deep and rich and it screams for a Blu Ray release, but if that doesn't happen, this version is more than sufficient. This is one of Disney's longest animated films at 90 minutes, but you would never know it for the pacing and story just seem to fly by. The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies including one of the best making of documentaries I've seen on a Disney film. If you don't own the film, then the 2 disc DVD is the the way to go at least until a Blu Ray release comes along.",1389830400,,1780,4.686900958466453

523133,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is my all time favorite Disney movie, even though Jasmine is my second favorite princess. I like that compared to other Disney movies Aladdin is a little darker, and has more magic and mystical elements to it, the sequels, and the series that followed movie 2.

The music in Aladdin is amazing. I give snaps and claps to the lyricist of the songs because they have an amazing vocabulary, and I'm glad they don't assume that the viewer is unable to speak English above a second grade comprehension level. The songs lyrics and music are catchy and get stuck in your head for weeks.

I love Robin Williams, everything he does in the name of comedy makes you laugh so hard you almost wet yourself, and Aladdin is no exception to that rule. He really makes the movie above and beyond the best Disney movie of all time.

I love that Aladdin becomes the person who is right for Jasmine by proving himself as a man and saving the Salton rather then being a royal born prince. The expression, Diamond in the Rough is perfect for the story of Aladdin and his inner beauty, not to mention it is a phrase that I've kept and use often in life and as a writer because it is a beautiful quote.

If you haven't seen this movie you need to watch is ASAP because it will blow you away. Hands down, best Disney Movie Ever!!!!",1387238400,,1314,4.372950819672131

I can't believe it's been since 1992 already! Even 20 years later, the animations still hold up, and Robin Williams delivers a killer performance as the genie.

Last but not least, Lea Salonga is gorgeously magnificient as the singing voice of Jasmine. A Whole New World is one of the most memorable ballad of the 90s for me.

523176,1,6302787068,"This is a wonderful film, and many people would love to own a copy of their own. Unfortunately, people will take advantage of this and produce counterfeit copies and sell them to online stores. The sellers don't know they are selling an illegal copy of a film, and unless someone notices it, both the seller and customer will get screwed. There are some ways to tell if your copy is a fake:

1. Check the bottom of the disc- The originals have a bar-code, while the fakes only have the name of the film and the number of the disc.
2. Check for several typos: ""Sidesplitting comedy and soaring adventure."" - The Original Aladdin back cover.
""Sidesplitting comedy and soaning adventure""- Fake DVD back cover.
3. The text will look off (it will be in the wrong font ect.)

Look out for these signs, and you will be more likely to find your ""Diamond in the Rough""",1384992000,6,859,4.464968152866242

Be careful what movies u buy from here!",1384905600,2,357,4.507692307692308
523179,4,6302787068,"In case any of you are confused about this, as of the time of this writing there is no Blu-Ray version of Aladdin officially released in the U.S., despite the posting in the Blu-Ray guide of Lady and the Tramp that Aladdin was to be released in the Diamond Collection in ""Spring 2013.""  According to Wikipedia,

""According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin was going released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013.[65] Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition in February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th Anniversary.[66][67] A new Diamond Edition release of Aladdin has not been announced since. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD). The same disc will be released in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2013.""

Now, you may be thinking, ""If it hasn't been released in the U.S. then I can't watch it in the U.S., then I can't watch it on a U.S. Blu-Ray player.""  In response to that, I again quote Wikipedia:

""As with the implementation of region codes for DVDs, Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, etc.) to do effective price differentiation between regions. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, ""all Blu-ray Disc players...(and) Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to support regional coding."" However, ""Use of region playback codes is optional for content providers...""[144] Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can therefore be played on any Blu-ray Disc player, in any region.[145]""

The majority of current Disney Blu-Rays are among these ""Region-Free"" Blu-Ray discs, including the U.K. Aladdin release I am reviewing here.  In case you're wondering how to tell, the Wikipedia article goes on to list the Blu-Ray region codes:

Region code Area
A Includes most North, Central, and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Korea.
B Includes most European, African, and Southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
C Includes the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as China and Russia.

Each of these region codes is represented by the letter in bold type surrounded by a hexagon, usually on the back of the case.  A region-code-free Blu-Ray shows all three region code symbols in a three-celled honeycomb pattern.

Anyway, now that that's cleared up, I would say that the U.K. release of Aladdin is OK, but not the best ever as far as Blu-Ray transfers are concerned.  The picture is crisp with vibrant colors and excellent sound, but the other (American) Blu-Ray releases I have are noticeably better.  However, this Aladdin release on Blu-Ray is still excellent as far as it goes, a beautiful example of Blu-Ray technology--just don't expect full Diamond Collection quality.

Now, I never had the opportunity to get the DVD release of the movie, so I can't be taken too seriously on this, but in comparison to the picture and sound quality of Disney DVD releases of other movies, I'd say that this Blu-Ray release of Aladdin goes way beyond what DVDs are capable of, but doesn't quite take advantage of the full potential of the format because of its hasty release, but it still is 100% Disney quality, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know.

Summary:
-Compatibility with U.S. Blu-Ray players: 5/5
-Video Transfer Quality: 4/5
-Audio Transfer Quality: 4.5/5
-Extras: 3/5",1384732800,7,3850,5.079239302694137

523223,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is one hour and thirty minutes and was released in theaters on November 25, 1992. The movie is about a diamond in the rough who is Aladdin who lives with his pet monkey Abu in the city of Agrabah. Aladdin and Abu steal so they can eat. One day while Aladdin and Abu are eating their breakfast they happen to spot a beautiful lady. Unknown to both of them it is the Princess Jasmine who is disguise as a commoner. Aladdin rescues Princess Jasmine when she is accused of stealing an apple from a merchant. Aladdin is caught and taken to the dungeon and there he meets Jafar in disguise as an old man. The old man takes Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders and tells Aladdin to get his lamp and he will reward him. Aladdin finds the lamp but Abu did nee heed the Cave of Wonders warning and touches a giant red diamond. The cave begins to collapse and the magic carpet rescues Aladdin and Abu and head towards the exit. Once they get to the exit Jafar tries to kill Aladdin, but Abu interferes and saves Aladdin and takes back the lamp from Jafar. Once Aladdin recovers from his fall, he rubs the lamp to read some writing on it and the Genie appears. This is where I end because I don't want to give away the rest of the movie. Aladdin was Disneys 31st animated movie and the forth movie in the Disney Renaissance era. Also this was the last movie that Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on. The movie won two Oscars for Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Original Score. Also it won a total of five Grammy Awards, four in 1994: Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television, Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and one in 1995 - Best Musical Album for Children.  Aladdin is a great movie and gets AAAAA+++++.

As a Christian, I believe firmly in the scriptures command that magic and sorcery is evil and is not to be accepted in any way whatsoever, and think this series does nothing more than dull our senses and make us comfortable with ""magic"" by believing it is innocent, and, even, ""child's play"".

I've had friends justify watching more serious portrayals of magic by saying ""well, nothing's wrong with Aladdin, so...""  And I've seen the effects of deeper immersion into these things.

The scripture warns us to stay far away from anything that has to do with magic for a reason.  I heed that warning now.",1378944000,,821,4.54421768707483

My daughter really loves the pets in the story, Jasmine's tiger Rajah and Aladdin's monkey Abu. Now every tiger she sees is Rajah, lol. I really like how it shows both worlds, the rich and the poor, and how their sufferings can still be similar. Princess Jasmine is sheltered and not free to make her own decisions and she feels trapped in the Palace. Aladdin, a homeless boy, is always having to find ways to survive on the streets by stealing food and necessities and he feels trapped by that desperation and helplessness. They both come together and show each other how the grass is not always greener on the other side, and what really makes you happy is not money and material things, but the love of a genuine person. The evil character Jafar is a little scary but not so much that my daughter was affected by him at all. And the Genie is the funniest character of all!! He will have you rolling! My daughter also really likes the magic carpet, which I think is genius to have in this cartoon. Above all, one of our family favorites!!",1377734400,2,1190,4.413636363636364

523362,5,6302787068,"Lots of action, adventure, and fun for the family.  Typical Disney in that many of the jokes work on two levels, one tickling the kids and the other tickling the adults.  This movie is a classic, good for the family's permanent library.",1375401600,,236,4.595238095238095
523363,3,6302787068,"The Cave of Wonders is scary! Okay, I am just stating that right now! I was frightened of the lava scene, the idea of going inside a talking cave that could kill someone is freaky! UggggggggggH! What kind of Disney film would allow something as scary as that to exist? That, along with the cave-in scene was why I was too scared of it as a kid! I thought it was the scariest Disney movie I had ever seen! This might seem weird since my favorite Disney film ""The Great Mouse Detective"" had a few scary shots, but they didn't make me shudder like this CREEPY TALKING MONSTER CAVE DID! YAAAAAAAAAH!

But I will admit, I have outgrown my fear of the Cave of Wonders, although the idea of going INSIDE that thing still creeps me out. I have been able to see the good inside this film, though it's still not one of my favorites, just reduced to the ""okay"" category. I mean, the Genie is a great comic relief, as well as Abu and the Magic Carpet who reminds me of the enchanted objects in ""Beauty and the Beast."" Jafar is a pretty cool villain, and Iago is pretty funny too.""Friend Like Me"" is very entertaining, and ""A Whole New World""is very enchanting. I think it seems similar to ""The Little Mermaid"" except for a male as the protagonist this time.

I guess I can watch this film a little better now that I'm not scared of it anymore. Honestly, I never HATED this film, I was just too scared of it, and I did like that TV series adaptation. But my frightening past with this film holds me back from loving it. The longer I had to put up with the Cave of Wonders, the quicker I just wanted to run away!",1375228800,,1598,4.2360655737704915

We have been eagerly waiting for it to come out on Blu Ray only to be constantly disappointed as other Disney films made it out first. For my husbands birthday I decided to go ahead and purchase Aladdin on DVD. When the DVD arrived, however, we discovered that the Platinum Edition is not a typical DVD but rather a dual layered DVD disc that is not necessarily compatible with every media device. Our Blu Ray player (which is designed to play DVDs as well) could not read the disc. It played fine on our computer (an older model) and our older DVD player, but not the new Blu Ray we purchased a few months ago. Upon closer inspection we realized that the problem was a compatibility issue and were able to watch it on an older DVD player we had stored away. Thankfully we had the DVD player or else we wouldn't have been able to watch the movie. I re-read the product description and didn't see anything that mentioned a chance for compatibility issues, though when I looked the DVD up online it mentioned repeatedly that this particular dual layered disc might not work for all players. The seller ought to add a note letting buyers know. It was very disappointing to have spent so much money for a product that was a great deal of hassle. That being said, we love the movie and are very satisfied with the quality of the product. It came in a timely manner, neatly packaged and in perfect condition.",1370390400,,1462,4.438661710037175

Jasmine is exotic and strong-minded character, how can anyone don't like her ? She's very beautiful character with head-strong personality and she's the only Arabian princess in Disney ever. She's a type of lady who truly believes that she will marry for love, not for royalty reasons and she hate to be treated like a trophy (I totally agree ). Jasmine felt trapped in her own palace and wants to be free; even she's not yet street-smarts on the outside world like Aladdin.

523862,5,6302787068,"A few years ago I had bought a Fullmetal Alchemist product,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Conqueror-of-Shamballa-Limited-Edition/dp/B000FS2VWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Conqueror of Shamballa (Limited Edition)</a>&nbsp;(which I actually bought twice, for a total of about $50, because I lost the first, and thought all the extras were great). I mention that because the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aladdin-gift-set/dp/B0001I561Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aladdin gift set</a>&nbsp;is similar - it includes a book, illustrations, and extras on the DVD's.

However, Aladdin's book has over twice the pages (though, the words are much larger, and most of the book is illustrations. The FMA book lists a bit about history and the world of the movie, which the Aladdin book doesn't, but the Aladdin book does talk about making the movie and the people involved)

Aladdin's gift set includes seven prints - signed sketches, and there's a lot of finished images in the book (the FMA product has ten fully colored prints and the book includes several pages of sketches). What makes Aladdin's prints more interesting, is that each one comes in a neat little paper frame, making them look so much more important. The sketches also seem special because the artists were asked to draw their character and in the medium of their choice, so if you know what to look for, you can see something about the artists' and characters' personalities. There's also Aladdin's ""Senitype"", a reproduced frame of the movie (which is quite cool).

There's a lot of extras on Aladdin's DVD's. FMA's and Aladdin's discs both have several commentaries, both have a 'the making of' video that shows quite a bit of stuff, and an image gallery (there's probably more to these in Aladdin's extras). Aladdin also has some deleted scenes and songs. I think the Aladdin gift set and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B0001I561E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two-Disc Platinum Edition</a>&nbsp;both have the same DVD extras, so between the two products, what I've mentioned earlier is probably more important.

As for the movie itself, when directly comparing it to the two sequels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Jafar/dp/B0007NY3AI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Jafar</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aladdin-and-the-King-of-Thieves/dp/B0007NY3A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aladdin and the King of Thieves</a>) and the TV series, the first movie looks different. The movie definitely uses colored lineart with some different line weights, while the lineart for the other movies seems to have the same line width and is probably black (though hard to tell for sure). I think the first movie is also the only one to have Carpet with this design, which is later simplified for the other movies and the series (it's mentioned in the extras that they used the computer to print Carpet's design because they couldn't draw that many details). Genie also has a glow to him that isn't in the other movies or the series. Instead of just being blue, he seems almost non-physical, like the puff of smoke he was designed to resemble. There's quite a few special effects in the movie (I usually prefer more traditional 2D stuff, but some of them work pretty well). I think this movie also paid a lot more attention to mood and emotion than the other movies and the series. It's mentioned that good guys wear blue, bad guys wear red (the theory of colors is based on some type of art, mentioned on the DVD), and the color scheme of a scene is based on the characters' feelings. A bit off topic, but something that has me slightly puzzled, Aladdin's personality changes after the first movie. He's much more clever in this movie than in the TV series.

The plot and enjoyability of the movie, I suppose depends on the person. I didn't really pay much attention to the movies when they came out, and though I watched some episodes of the series on TV, didn't think all that much about it until this year. But, there's something to be said when people's ideas of a genie are based on this movie, and when everyone knows the name Aladdin (though the movie isn't original, the things it's based on aren't that well known).",1350086400,,4449,5.704374057315234

I am just saying that when my collection of VHS tapes became old and the analog magnetic media was faltering due to playback, I wanted to get digital of my old movies. But new Disney movies are about $20 even when used.

When Disney movies first came out you could spend up to $100 to get a video that went back in the Disney vault.

Well, same thing is happening with DVD, while we wait for the videos to come out on Blu-ray.

So my solution is to seek out the older videos on the stable LaserDisc format, they are digital and usually disney videos are not subject as much to Laser Rot that damaged discs (there are resources to check if the LD was subject to laser rot)

So I get the classics in digital about 425 lines of resolution as opposed to VHS which is about 220 lines.  Not as good as DVD or Blu-ray but great for watching my favorite Disney Video's again, without spending tons of money.",1344643200,,930,4.2259887005649714

523876,4,6302787068,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  It's hardly a mystery why the ""Aladdin"" myth attracted Disney's animation crew back in 1992.  This timeless story boasts everything: exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie.  However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of ""Aladdin""'s greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities.  In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything.  So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over?  Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.

  Besides, doesn't Aladdin succeed solely because of the Genie?  You may recall that Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) promises to free the unbridled genie with his third wish.  However, after the Genie makes him a fabulously wealthy prince on the verge of wooing the Sultan's (Douglas Seale) alluring daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) toward matrimony, Aladdin wants to renege on the deal because he feels he cannot continue this ultimate charade without the Genie's continued help.  Understandably, this puts the Genie in a funk and leads to a series of plot twists that place the Genie under the control of the ruthlessly ambitious Sultan's vizier (consultant) Jafar (Jonathan Freeman).  It seems that Aladdin goes from hero back to hopeless zero.

  But hold on thearrrr, as Quick Draw McGraw would say, Disney shows us that Aladdin is not such a hopeless nothing.  From the beginning of the film, where we see the penniless orphan and his pilfering simian accomplice Abu (Frank Welker) acrobatically elude the Sultan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable.  Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish.  Furthermore, even the Genie's vast power has its limits.  Besides servitude to whoever has the lamp, the Genie informs Aladdin that he has no power over death or love.  In other words, he can't be an assassin, or the Messiah, or Cupid.  If Aladdin wants to woo Jasmine, he ultimately has to do it on his own.  And when Jafar exploits the Genie to become a sultan and sorcerer and uses his power to neutralize his friends, Aladdin again has to find it within himself to defeat Jafar on his own.  Instead of false princely status, he uses his courage, sly wit and Jafar's voracious desire for ultimate magic to bring him down.

  So you see, ""Aladdin"" belies its ethereal, insubstantial structure and supernatural fantasy elements to remind us that, after all, even if you have true friends to help you along, the true magic to make your life better lies within you.",1338249600,,3199,5.133462282398453

Aladdin was one of the last classic Disney films produced before the new millennium brought forth a different wave of animated films. Every child today should have the opportunity to watch Aladdin! Maybe they'll enjoy it as much as I did when I was their age!",1335484800,,571,4.663366336633663

She researched it and there seems to be no code on it like all the other dvd's that are Disney movies.

523911,2,6302787068,"I'm really disgusted by Disney's 2-disc Platinum Edition DVDs, a line in which they manage to butcher every last one of my favorite classic Disney films with all sorts of unnecessary ""improvements"" that, quite frankly, give me the urge to run into every department store I can find and start tearing them off the shelves to make a bonfire in the parking lot out of protest.

First, I had to cancel and return two orders of The Lion King because I found out they featured a really stupid deleted song called ""The Morning Report"" that made my soul die when I first heard it, and now they have JESSICA SIMPSON AND NICK LACHEY singing ""A Whole New World"" with another precious deleted song they just HAD to put in sung by Clay Aiken?!

I'm sorry. I don't want ""new and improved"", I want the classic versions of the films I grew up with. Why is that too much to ask for?

Disney has a huge stick up their behinds when it comes to the matter of making their classic animated films available on DVD. It's not enough that they practice moratorium, oh no. When we get lucky enough that they actually do release them, they have to make all these stupid cringe-worthy ""improvements"" that leave a really bad taste in your mouth.

Wise up, Disney! WE WANT THE CLASSICS, not your improved products! I finally was able to purchase a 1-disc DVD edition of The Lion King recently that actually (holy crap!) had the full movie in beautiful clarity WITHOUT any glaring changes!!

The bad thing? Even THAT is limited edition, so get it while you can!

Disney disgusts me more and more as time goes on. My suggestion is to do some research and read through a lot of reviews before purchasing this product, because 9 times out of 10, it is NOT the original.

Unless the little things don't bother you as much as they bother me, STAY AWAY FROM DISNEY'S 2-DISC PLATINUM LINE!!",1322092800,6,1852,4.494047619047619

His performance is reason alone to rent this movie. The storyline is appropriate for most kids and while there are some scary parts, they aren't too intense and are not graphic. The theme of being oneself carries through the whole movie and doesn't come across in a moralistic manner.

The animation is at times grainy and flat. I remember it being quite good at the time it came out. Technology has simply advanced so far in the intervening years that older animation seems antiquated. That said, it's not too bothersome and is saved by the skill of the Disney talent pool at developing the characters personality through their actions and expressions.",1318377600,3,827,4.703448275862069

523987,4,6302787068,"Aladdin (1992) will either knock the socks off viewers, or confound
them as an incomprehensible cartoon and musical or finally,
constitute a piece of art for creators of art, in the sense that so
much is packed into the product, from an artistic point of view and
the manner in which it is done, that it  suggests this release was
not entirely designed for the mass market or to have a mass appeal.

First, the spectacular is definitely here,  starting with the
top-quality animation work (colors, flow, designs, accuracy and
style of the drawings) which is expected from Disney. The historic
parallel story told about ""Alladin"" is woven into this script, with
entertainment being the overwhelming concern - a totally correct
decision. Those elements add up such that they satisfy paying
consumers and boost the replay value immensely.

From an audio point of view,  the jingle is immediately recognizable
as an Aerosmith's number ( ""Rag Doll, livin' in a movie ... so fine
they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door""), here rerecorded
with a Louis Armstrong style and instrumentation.

Secondly, a not small part of the story is farfetched, with no
imaginative boundaries ... this definitely takes this movie into a
completely other dimension, bringing it ever closer to what everyone
knows as dreams. Being incomprehensible is perhaps intentional, in
the sense that this picture is not designed ONLY for youths, but
also for parents and grown ups, both who will find themselves
laughing out loud, chuckling and amazed at the many sequences
throughout the 90 minutes. Some parts are sincere but hard-hitting,
tender and brutal at the same time.

Finally, the wide-ranging, not timid and no-limits of the story,
much of it resulting from observation immersed in reality, calls
forth other emotions - sarcasm,  parody or mockery of certain
cultural elements of non-Western countries. Examples is the concept
of pre-arranged marriages, monarchies, strong arm guards, beheadings
for minor misakes, a camel shown with a tongue hanging out from
overwork and thirst,  social caste systems, etc.

Or in other words, a fair bit seems extreme and not essential to a
cartoon, so that no doubt a part of the audience may find them
politically incorrect or controversial and out of step with the 21st
century.

The often heard shouting raises eyebrows, considering that the
script concerns the romance between Aladdin and a princess.

Taken together, the script rises above and beyond the mainstream,
which is why, perhaps, this movie is an artist's art . designed for
those who are jaded about revisiting again a classic story. e.g. a
showbiz style of speech is used at times to parody certain moments
in the able

523996,4,6302787068,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The Walt Disney Company's 1992 movie ""Aladdin"" boasts an intelligent screenplay, great songs, and the huge climactic battle we have come to expect from Disney-adapted fairytales and legends.  Yet, there is a crucial element missing that would have taken this production from being a very good modern Disney flick to being one of the all-time great animated films from the studio.

For every good choice in regard to vocal casting, there is either a corresponding bad choice and/or negative consequences.  For example, Jonathan Freeman is an excellent choice to voice Jafar, the evil sorceror.  Silky and cultured, yet also dripping with malice, Mr. Freeman creates a classic Disney villain with his vocal performance.  To voice his parrot, the cleverly named Iago, Gilbert Gottfried is absolutely the wrong choice.  Mr. Gottfried's trademark high screaming voice can be very humorous under the right circumstances, but these are not the right circumstances.  The movie is not tonally suited to the comic.  Scott Weinger's earnest, simple performance as Aladdin is perfect, but I wish Robin Williams had played the genie with a shade more ambiguity and darkness instead of the over-the-top comedy that is strongly in evidence here.  The sharp contrasts between the respective good and evil characters do not favor the movie in the long run.

Also featuring the vocal talent of the late Douglas Seale, The Walt Disney Company's ""Aladdin"" is very, very good.  However, a few different storytelling and creative decisions would have made it great.",1272412800,,1560,5.271255060728745

Alassin is the poor unassuming hero with a heart of gold, and he becomes the hero only because of his attraction to the sultan's beautiful and headstrong daughter.  The villian does all he can to place himself in power, and the genie and the most cleaver character in the whole movie - the magic carpet - provide the comic relief.

The movie is definitely watchable, it's fun, and extremely Disneyesque.

These are the real Disney classics.

I recieved this as an unexpected Christmas present several years ago, and was pleasantly surprised.  I watched the film and the special features.  They impressed me beyond compare.  Besides the glorious film itself, the special features are some of the very best I've seen, and that's saying a lot.  THREE WISHES, the comprehensive making-of documentary, is a joy to watch.  The cartoon of the Genie's round-the-world vacation is short but sweet, and the 3D magic carpet adventure is stunning.  And those are just three.

524069,4,6302787068,"I sure hope so, because Disney's take on ""Aladdin"" is a wonderful rollercoaster ride of a tale.  Tucked securely in the middle of Disney's animated ""Renaissance"" in the late 80's to mid 90's, this fun-filled story pops off of the screen thanks to a wonderful digital transfer that highlights both the traditional animation of Disney and the (at the time) growing digital animation of Pixar.  This is most evident in the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin, Abu and the Magic Carpet go for a wild ride as the cave collapses in on them.

The plot is fairly generic.  It's a love story about a young man living on the streets and longing to become a ""somebody"" who falls for a young woman intent on breaking free from the chains of tradition.  Throw a power-hungry Vizier into the mix and you've got yourself a basic dramatic love story.  What makes this story more than just another run-of-the-mill animated romance, however, is a solid string of supporting characters who steal the show.  The chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine is nice, but Robin Williams' Genie, who's own longing for freedom is an interesting subplot, injects the story with humor and action.  Gilbert Gottfried's Iago, the highly intelligent and cocky pet of the wicked Jafar, injects humor as well, though with quite a bit more bite than the Genie.  Heck even characters with smaller roles such as Abu, the Sultan, and the speechless Carpet, add fun to the story.

Although the soundtrack isn't quite up to par with other Disney modern classics such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King,"" ""Aladdin"" has one of my personal favorite tunes in its arsenal, ""A Whole New World.""  Both the film version and the pop radio cut by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson are excellent.  This particular DVD features a new version of the song performed by then-married couple, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson.  Unfortunately for them, though, their version lacks the heart and soul that the film's and BelleBryson's version contains.

This platinum edition DVD is a nice addition to any collection.  As stated before, the animation pops off of the screen.  The audio is excellent and the extras are a nice addition as well.  A Clay Aiken video, the original radio version of ""A Whole New World"" video, the Simspon/Lachey cut, and a pop-up information option highlight disc one.

As a whole, ""Aladdin"" is a wonderful tale sure to capture the imagination of children and adults.  It isn't as breathtaking as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" nor is it as epic as ""The Lion King,"" but it has secured a spot for itself as one of Disney's greatest modern classics.

Everyone has Their own personality; Their own spark; and definitely Their own drive; Own minds.

Aladdin is your typical Arabian ""rat""; so poor, you can see the holes and patches of his ""MC Hammer"" pants! But We all have grown to love such a noble, charming and adorable, hopeless romantic.

Next up is Genie, who plays an even bigger part than Princess Jasmine, Aladdin's love interest. He cast spells, and gives Aladdin next to anything He wants. Very trustworthy, and a Friend for life for our Friend, Aladdin.

Princess Jasmine is as stubborn as She is pretty! She lives in the palace with her sweet and short father, and wants to fall in love and marry Aladdin after they cross eyes a few times.

Abu is the cutest little Monkey You'll likely ever see. Very interesting yet mischievous, He keeps Everyone on Their toes!! (*LOL*)

Lastly, Iago is very talkative; to the point where People love to walk away from Him when He goes on a blabber-fit! Princess Jasmine doesn't trust Him and the Genie finds some space in His giant heart to deal with Him and His everyday trials. Saying He tries His hardest to rat out Aladdin, is the understatement of the month!

Jafar's also in it. He's evil and stuff, but doesn't really have the dark heart that Malificent has in Sleeping Beauty. ''' Crafty and wise, He tries to rip Aladdin's wonderous Dreams apart...

524081,5,6302787068,"I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.

Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day.

Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining.",1189296000,,1062,4.441025641025641

SOUNDS GREAT - LOOKS GREAT & IT'S GOT ROBIN WILLIAMS & AN EXCITING PLOT TOO!

IN A NUTSHELL: A WHOLE NEW WORLD & IT INCLUDES ROBIN WILLIAMS AS THE GENIE

This DVD release of 'Aladdin' by Disney is a treat for audiences regardless of age. It is one of the few films I can think of that both children and their parents may equally enjoy, and this Platinum Edition DVD is the best way I know to bring Aladdin into our homes.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: BOY MEETS GIRL - BOY MUST BE WORTHY OF GIRL ON HIS OWN MERITS!

Jasmine is 'PRINCESS JASMINE' and she must be married to a prince before her 18th birthday, which is in three days, as the film opens. Needless to say, she is less than excited by the suitors who have presented to claim her. ""Another Stuffed Shirt - Swaggering Peacock"", to use her words. After deciding to runaway - without planning for any expenses or anything for that matter - she runs into Aladdin during a street market fracas caused by her lack of currency, and is saved by Aladdin from the knife point of a greedy merchant. Thinking that Jasmine was just an ordinary girl, Aladdin set his sights on her, but found it was necessary to flee from the palace guards several times with Jasmine in tow. Aladdin discovers to his chagrin, as Jasmine declares her identity to the palace guards, that she is no ordinary girl, which puts her out of Aladdin's reach.

BUT THIS IS ONLY WHERE THE STORY BEGINS: ALADDIN: ""THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH""

Believe it or not, the film goes along happily for over 40 minutes before Robin Williams makes his entrance as the Genie. By this time we know that Aladdin must elevate his station to attain the hand of 'Princess Jasmine' - but how?

A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE! BUT PRINCE ALI?

Acquiring the services of the Genie for three wishes has made it possible for Aladdin to elevate his station rather profoundly by simply wishing for it. So Prince Ali is born, along with a terrific song, lyrics and video action. Unfortunately, wishing does not make one different on the inside, and this Prince Ali charade is doomed from the start. But ---- Aladdin will elevate himself and redeem the trust which Princess Jasmine was beginning to place in him, on his own merit.

THERE IS STILL MORE--LOTS MORE: ONE CAN'T JUST WISH FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT-ASK ALADDIN

This film has a lovely story and wonderful animation, but it also has Robin Williams who gives a truly over-the-top performance as the Genie. He is the Genie and is so quick and witty and glib that audiences, regardless of age, will really zone in on his delivery. His role clearly demonstrates that one cannot simply change or improve oneself by simply wishing for it. This type of change and improvement comes from within and we go back to the theme 'the diamond in the rough'.

No decent hero can be much of a hero without a fiendish and sly villain over whom to prevail. 'Jafar' and his evil sidekick 'Iago' provide the needed balance to present Aladdin with a real obstacle. Jafar readily grabs at the chance to elevate his standing by wishing for it, and first wishes to be the Sultan, then the ""most powerful sorcerer in the world"" and ultimately the ""all-powerful genie"". This leads him down the path that Aladdin did not take and we get to see exactly what Jafar reaps in the end, which demonstrates that the only way to improve oneself is by exerting an honest effort, not just wishing for it.

IN THE END: WE GET BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN - ""A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE""

Aladdin must defeat Jafar on his own and in so doing may redeem himself fully in the eyes of Jasmine and her father, the Sultan.

524093,5,6302787068,"I feel lucky to count myself among those who grew up watching modern masterpieces such as ""Aladdin"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the like. Nowadays they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Sad but true. (I'm not keen on the Pixar flicks, sorry). I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with ""Mermaid"" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. ""Aladdin"" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise. Nevertheless, ""Aladdin"" remains as enjoyable as ever and much better than most of its successors.",1178323200,,1065,4.64021164021164
524094,5,6302787068,I got this as a gift for my niece and she adores the DVD every time she puts it on. Story is told well with great songs/music to sing along to. Production work is A+. Makes a very nice gift for kids or the kid in the adult.,1177891200,,223,3.6666666666666665
524095,5,6302787068,"The story of Aladdin, from a collection of stories dating back more than a millennium, has been filmed dozens of times in dozens of variations.  However, none was ever filmed as creatively, humorously and family friendly as Disney Studios did in 1992.  The success of the movie owes much to the talents of Robin Williams, whose manic impersonations and characterizations propel this movie along at a frantic pace.  Disney also kept the story of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine simple, helping the appeal of the movie.

This story is relatively simple, cutting out much of the detail from the original story.  Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger), is a teenager trying to find enough to eat in Baghdad.  Though Aladdin steals food and is a bit of a rogue, he also has a sense of fairness, honor and innocence, a ""diamond in the rough"" that evil Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) needs to enter the Cave of Wonders to steal the magic lamp.

Aladdin enters the cave and finds the lamp, but uses the lamp to escape and become Prince Ali in an attempt to win the heart and hand of Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin).  As we learn early in the movie, Princess Jasmine wants nothing to do with phonies and princes; she is looking for someone to whom she can give her heart, someone who will understand and love her.  Prince Ali is not that person.

Jafar wants the power of being the Sultan of Baghdad.  His plan is simple, get the lamp, gain absolute power, marry Jasmine, and take over the world; not necessarily in that order.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Jafar's trusty adviser Iago the Parrot, voiced by the always obnoxious and, certainly in the case of this movie, funny Gilbert Gottfried.  Perhaps if Jafar had not had a parrot as an advisor, things might have turned out different for him.

The animation in this edition of the movie is marvelous.  The colors are bright and images are quite clear.  This movie is excellent to watch on your big screen television.

Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music.  The standout song is ""A Whole New World,"" but I also liked ""Prince Ali"" and ""One Jump Ahead.""  Alan Menken's score and Tim Rice's music garnered an Oscar for Menken and an Oscar for Menken and Rice.  In fact, this movie won 22 significant awards and was nominated for another 15.

Aladdin is a good guy trying to survive in a tough world.  Princess Jasmine is nave and innocent.  Aladdin's love for Jasmine is pure and teenage and children and teenagers everywhere will identify with Aladdin's angst.  The song and dance routines of the Robin Williams' Genie keep the overall tone of this movie light, which is necessary to help balance the evil of Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman).

I recommend this movie for all members of the family except for the very youngest members, who may be frightened by the images of Jafar and the Genie is a couple of the scenes.  Most children ages 4 and above should be able to watch this movie with little difficulty.

Enjoy!",1177718400,,3024,4.635338345864661
524096,5,6302787068,"Alladin is one of the all time best Disney animated films.  The story is sweet and satisfying.

524105,3,6302787068,"While I do like this movie for an adult, I don't think this should be rated G. It has quite a few things in it that people with high values would not want their children seeing. Here is a list of the ones I can remember:

1. At the beginning, one of the ""bad guys"" says that he just ""slit someone's throat"".

2. There is a part when Aladdin first meets the Genie where the genie has half-dressed girls all dancing around Aladdin and rubbing their butts against him. My young child looked at me with a puzzled face on that part, and made a comment.

3. The Genie often changes himself into women and starts talking in that type of voice. Then in another part says how much he likes Aladdin, but that he won't be ""picking out curtains with him anytime soon"" or something to that effect. Luckily children won't get this joke, but it could still be considered offensive.

4. There's another part in the movie where the princess is being controlled by the bad guy, and when they show that he has taken over, she's all the sudden in these very skimpy clothes. My child asked me at this part, ""Why did they take off her clothes?!""

I would've never bought this movie if I had watched it first. At least not for a child. I just thought I should post this point of view in case there are others out there thinking of buying this movie who wouldn't want their children seeing/hearing these types of things.",1164153600,13,1396,4.333333333333333

the story is well delivered and blends action, and romance briliantly along with comic relief characters that never seem corny or out of place. that seemlessnes keeps this film from becoming too sereous or light hearted.

the animation is strong yet again. by this point disney was beginning to experiment with computer animation and what it could do. that helped the film imensley. the film's animation style itself is highly stylized but it works perfectly here.

524111,4,6302787068,"I watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter just tonight. It is supposed to be the story of Aladdin from the ""Thousand and one nights"" also known as ""Arabian nights"". The problem is that it deviates from the true story in many ways. For example there is no ""ring"" or its Genie in the movie at all. There are additions such as the monkey turned elephant as well. In fact there are so many other deviations that it would take me a whole day to mention. However to be fair, this is not unique to this movie. Most movies, Disney in particular tend to rewrite master pieces resulting in vastly modified stories.

Now this modified story, is perfectly OK by itself and my daughter loved it. There are some clear attempts to make the story appealing to adults. But then it helps to have parents interested! The songs are good and kids love them.

As for the politically correct change from the first Disney release i.e. replacing the  arab stereotyping, it is not unique. Disney also replaced a particularly offensive (stereotyping of africans) part of Fantasia in their DVD offer. My feeling is that we could all do with less racism and if it means  removing offensive scenes and language we should do so. Besides this movie was never the real story anyway and the ""non-PC"" part hardly contributed anything. After all the value of the movie is not in how many people it hurts. My advise is: If you want the real story, please read the book.

On the whole, this is a great movie, just not the real story!",1146182400,3,1502,4.487179487179487
524112,5,6302787068,"One of the better Disney Classics... maybe the second most entertaining after the Lion King.

This is the best plotlines that Disney has come up with (after the Lion King.

Overview:

Aladdin is a poor street rat and the hero. He falls in love with Princess Jasmine. But evil Jafar is trying to become the sultan and the most powerful person in the world. Aladdin gets the geni and must try to get the girl, and defeat Jafar.

Why it is Good

Funny

THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!!!! Geni is Robin Williams. Iago is Gilford Gottfried. These two are sooooooo hilarious!!!! I'm an Adult and after years since I first watched it is still hilarious. My 2 year old neice also laughed her head off. I think that it is one of the funniest disney movies. The comedy is perfect!!!

Plotline and Drama

This is an amazing plotline. It doesn't slow down. There is no part where the movie drags or you start to feel like the drama is just going on. It moves at a awesome pace where you just keep watching. The story is great. Its original. NOT DULL.

SONGS

The music is not as great as the lion king. But it doesn't take away from the story or slow it down. I mean there are no musical numbers that the story line stops and the characters start singing. The music helps drives the plots and is funny to. The better songs is the classic ""A Whole New World"" and ""Prince Ali"".

ENTERTAINING my verdict

THIS IS THE TOP ECHELON OF DISNEY MOVIE. IT TRULY IS A CLASSIC. IT IS ENTERTAINING FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN. ITS FUNNY. THE PLOT DOES NOT DRAG ON AND GET DULL. MUSIC DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!",1145836800,,1630,4.308196721311475
524113,5,6302787068,"While Disney's early animated films were seen as masterpieces (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan), there was a long time when Disney's animated features were met with mediocre box office receipts.  After The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Oliver and Company (I'm not saying they're bad, just poorly received in theaters), there was a Rennaissance or second coming of Disney films.  Starting with The Little Mermaid and going on to Beauty and the Beast (which remains the only animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and probably the only one ever due to the creation of the Best Animated Feature category), Aladdin came soon after.

Telling the story of the poor young boy who found a genie and got three wishes, Aladdin is a first for most animated films, due to its inclusion of pop culture references (more on that later).

Aladdin is a young thief living in the fictional Agrabah (the tale took place in medieval Baghdad, but due to the Gulf War, this detail was changed).  He and his partner-in-crime Abu (who is a monkey) must steal in order to survive, but in doing so must avoid the royal guards who police the marketplace.  One day, he runs into a woman who is about to lose her hand for stealing an apple and giving it to a young child who is starving.  He saves her and takes her to his home to hide from the law.  It turns out that the girl is really Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan.  She ran away from the palace in order to see what life outside the walls was really like.  The Sultan needs to marry her off to a prince (the law dictates that she must marry a prince, and she must be married by a given birthday).  She is taken back to the palace, and Aladdin is arrested for ""kidnapping"" the princess.

Little do either of them know that Jafar, the Sutan's vizier, is plotting against the Sultan and hopes to get his hands on a lamp which houses a genie.  He needs a ""diamond in the rough"" in order to enter the Cave of Wonders and retrieve the lamp, and when he learns that Aladdin is the boy he's looking for, he has the guards sieze him (which happened when he was with Jasmine).  Though he tells Jasmine that Aladdin has been beheaded for his crimes, he later disguises himself as a prisoner and helps Aladdin get out of the cell.  He brings Aladdin to the cave and tells him that, in exchange for the lamp, Aladdin will receive a reward beyond his wildest dreams.  Though, due to Abu's greed, Aladdin and Abu get trapped in the cave along with the lamp and a magic flying carpet.  Aladdin accidentally releases the Genie of the lamp, who promises him three wishes and a way out of the cave.  This is where the pop culture references begin.  The Genie (who is expertly voiced by Robin Williams) spouts off references, impressions, and jokes at a mile a minute (my favorite of which being a Jack Nicholson impression).  He does Ed Sullivan, Pinnochio, Arnold Schwarzenneger, and numerous others.

Anyway, from there, Aladdin wishes to become a prince so that he can marry Jasmine.  Little does he know that Jasmine has no interest in marrying a prince, despite what the law dictates.  At first, she is upset that yet another vapid prince has come to win her, but he eventually wins her over by taking her on a ride on his carpet across the world (it wins her too quickly to seem real, but it will have to work due to pacing issues).  After that, she agrees to marry him.  This leads Aladdin to reconsider his promise to free the Genie with his third wish, because he fears that he will need his services and help in the future.  Meanwhile Jafar tries to find a way to get rid of Aladdin, and eventually he steals the lamp away, turning Agrabah into hell on Earth.

While there may not have been any twists (it was fairly by-the-numbers), Aladdin is a very enjoyable movie.  The animation is great (while not as revolutionary as it was back in 1992, it is still good), and the songs are some of Disney's best, especially A Whole New World.  Furthermore, it can serve as an interesting study in freedom for older viewers.  Being free and feelings of confinement/imprisonment was a major theme throughout the movie.  And even if the older viewers don't like film analysis, there is still a lot there to enjoy.

Aladdin is a great example of how a kids' movie can be for everyone (maybe not as good an example as The Incredibles).  It is fun, funny, and very well done overall.",1145145600,2,4443,4.493150684931507
524114,5,6302787068,"Having never before seen this movie, the DVD experience was a first viewing for me. I was particularly pleased with the Disney sound. Disney has done a good job with both the sound and picture. The movie is simply an enjoyable experience for adults as well as children. If one has the advantage of full surround sound, the Disney sound is enveloping in the home theater environment.",1142812800,2,382,4.7164179104477615
524115,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is true, classic, Disney magic. It has everything I've always wanted from my animated movies: gorgeous visuals, laugh-aloud humour, sing-along songs, an appealing hero, and a heroine little girls can feel good about looking up to. I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.

There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", and ""Prince Ali"" delight and amuse, while the ""One Jump Ahead"" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping ""A Whole New World"" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.

My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!

This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight!",1141344000,,2364,4.746958637469587
524116,2,6302787068,"I was about 12 when I saw this in the theater back in '92, and got the soundtrack close to the same time (between myself and my brother, i guess we just about wore the CD out).  When the VHS came out, I was very shocked to notice that the first line of the first song had been dubbed over -- it sounds to me, even to this day, as if some random editor in the back room of the studio paused the tape, plugged in a 5-dollar microphone, and sang some new lyrics he'd just written on-the-spot.  The original words, ""where they cut off your ear..."" is racist only to people with no sense of dry humor or wit.  Add to this insult the fact that it sounds as bad as if some line of the genie's had been replaced by dialogue spoken by richard simmons.  you get the idea.

Hopefully someday Disney will see fit to release films *at least* uncensored, if not with their original artwork (multiple versions are possible on DVD, why not use this feature sometimes?).  Until then, I'm not wasting my money.",1141344000,2,992,4.25

524120,5,6302787068,"In 2004, after about a decade out of print, Disney finally released Aladdin for the first time on the DVD format and they did a bang-up job on the whole package.

First of all, the video and audio are FLAWLESS. Colors pop out, there is absolutely no grain to be found, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, none of that crap that sometimes affect DVD transfers.

The bonus features range from the vapid and unnecessary (Music videos by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, anyone?) to the fun and fabulous (Genie's Lamp Tour) to the incredible meaty bonus features we've come to expect from a Platinum Edition release. Deleted song demos, still frame galleries, awesome games, and the super-meaty making-of docu make this DVD worth every single penny.

In conclusion, Aladdin is one of the best Disney films. Filled with awesome songs including the Oscar-winning A Whole New World and featuring memorable characters, this fabulous movie has recieved a worthy DVD treatment.

I seen this great work when it initially came out in the theater. It was my first Disney movie of my adult life.

I took it back to my retailer the next day for an exchange. The same thing happened 3 times! I was not happy with the special features as well! C'mon, Clay Aiken. Someone must have made a grave error! I eventually gave up trying to get a playable copy and sold this irreparable copy to a video resale agent.

524123,4,6302787068,"After the phenomenal success of The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, Disney's third modern revolutionary animated film would go for lighter territory but still retain the emotional punch that made their previous two films work so well. The memorable music from Howard Ashman and Alan Menkin drives the movie forward comedically while being careful not to sacrifice story potential. There is however a critical flaw in Aladdin, the title star is outshone by the fast-talking, shape-shifting genie. The romance between Princess Jasmine and the young street rat is sidelined and sometimes roughly composed. Robin Williams is frenetic and fun, and that's great, but some more time and effort should have been spent on the driving force of the film, The genie is a critical character, but it's a story of romance, the genie should have been given less to roam. One of the abandoned songs for the film 'Proud of your Boy' where Aladdin ruminates on his poverty-ruined life, should have been used, because it really shows where he's coming from. Some fascinating and imaginative ideas were unfortunatly ditched in favour of Genie laughs. Of course comedy has always been an essential ingredient in their films, but in this case, there could have been more emotion. Perhaps there should have been more time to work out the kinks before being rushed into cinemas. The animation is mostly smooth and expertly-crafted, despite some obvious rush jobs in the second half, where some second-rate animation becomes apparent. Regardless of its flaws, Aladdin saw Disney rake in even more money, with the box office success even more impressive than Beauty and the Beast. The DVD extras are impressive and the digital transfer is top-notch. An essential for Disney fans.",1120867200,,1761,5.118055555555555

524127,5,6302787068,"Anxious to follow up on the massive commercial and critical success of Beauty And The Beast, Disney created another animated masterpiece with Aladdin. Although not nearly as successful (in terms of critical acclaim) as the aforementioned film or later Disney creations, The Lion King and Finding Nemo, Aladdin is nevertheless just as entertaining and probably the funniest of all the animated Disney features. With the voice of Robin Williams leading the way, the film is a non-stop foray into the fantasy world of A Thousand And One Arabian Nights spliced together with the rapier-like wit and quick-fire humor of one of America's most talented performers...

The film takes place hundreds of years ago in the windswept sands of the kingdom of Agrabah, where a young street urchin named Aladdin spends his days wandering the streets, stealing and hustling for survival, with his loyal companion Abu - a clever and enterprising monkey. Yet, in stark contrast to the poverty in the streets below, the brilliant facades of a massive palace tower high above the background of Aladdin's life. Inside, the Sultan of Agrabah lives a life of luxury with his beautiful daughter, Jasmine, and a cunning, evil adviser named Jafar.

Forced to spend her days inside the palace walls (against her wishes), the headstrong Princess Jasmine sneaks out in order to experience life on the outside. While scouring the dangerous streets of her kingdom, the girl befriends Aladdin who is immediately awestruck by her beauty. But when Princess Jasmine's escape becomes known to Jafar and her father, she is quickly rounded up, and Aladdin is put in prison. Hoping to seize the kingdom for himself, Jafar enlists the aid of Aladdin in an effort to obtain a fabled magic lamp, the purported powers of which are unlimited. Because legend has it that only a ""diamond in the rough"" is capable of retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders...

524130,1,6302787068,"When i sat down to watch this film with my niece and nephews i expected to see an accurate representation of one of the greatest nations of our world. However, i was deeply disappointed with what i saw. Not only is the Arabic culture put to shame in this cliche display of samurai swords and desert wastelands, but the historical era is pushed aside in a weak effort to entertain.

First, i was disappointed that the film was in english. I thought that it would at least be in Persian if not the language of Urdu which arose in the military camps during Sultan Akbar's reign. And Not only does the Sultan in the movie not exist but neither does his advisor unless Disney is hinting at the role Nur Juhan took in her husband Jahangir reign of the Mughals. Also, the architechtual layout is all wrong. Such structures were not created until the rule of Sultan Shah Jahan around 1630. If the movie was set in 1630 though, the royal garb of princess Jasmine would predate Nur Jahan's designs and therefore signify economic stress in the city of Aggrabah (which is obviously not the case due to the oppulent splendor which frequents the film.)I would like to add that due to the strict confines of class in the early Islamic world the peasant Aladdin would never have been allowed to rise to any station of importance. Such fanciful events should be eliminated from our storybooks as they give children false hope and skewed ideas of society and how it works.

All in all i found this film to be entirely frusterating. When we push history aside for the sake of entertainment we know for sure that our country is taking a step in the wrong direction. The youth of America should rise up against this movie and its subtle hints at white supremacy. I know one thing for sure though, my children will never see this movie.",1111622400,14,1814,4.527439024390244

However to me, there are a few minor drawbacks about the dvd. One of them was that they had Nick Lachey & Jessica Simpson singing ""A Whole New World"". Now, I don't mean to be pesky about those two.

But I was conscerened at first for buying the DVD because I wasn't sure whether they might butchered a favorite song of mind / in this case everybody's most favourite song of all time.

And lets face it everytime you see the words: ""Nick and Jessica"" on MTV channel, you'd literally say ""Oh God"" and switch the channel without a doubt. Fortunately they did a pretty decent job on it. But Clay Aiken's great in singing ""Proud Of your Boy"", a deleted song that was meant to be very impportant in telling the story. Personally, I think it's better you buy the DVD to see it yourself. But Clay Aiken sure knows how to sing............

Another minor drawback was that there was nice interview session with all the cast and crew of the film. However, I was kinda dissapointed because Robin Williams (the Genie) wasn't included. I'd say if we can hear what he's gonna say about his character which is a really popular icon in animation, then the whole DVD would be DAMN NEAR PERFECT!!!!!

It's a no brainer that the movie is more than special. It's extrodinary. Tell you this, in my 19 YEARS OF LIFE. This is THE FIRST TIME I ever watch Aladdin. Before I only know him and everybody by TV and books. But watching the original movie that started everything was the BEST EVER. Heck it's even recommended if you got deppression. Trust me, you gotta experience to believe it.

So, if you're still left out like me, go get it now. Let it shine together with all the other newly released / upcoming digitally restored Disney DVDs. You'd do yourself a BIG favor.",1102982400,5,2200,4.526448362720403
524140,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is an orphan stealing what he needs to eat.  Jasmine is the princess, but is unhappy to be forced to marry.  One day, they meet in the market, and its love at first sight.  But Jasmine can only marry a prince.  Meanwhile, Jafar's schemes to go from advisor to Sultan bring him across Aladdin's path.  But when Aladdin finds the Genie of the lamp, things really get interesting.

And fun.  As anyone who has seen this movie will tell you, Robin Williams as the Genie absolutely makes this movie.  I still haven't caught all his characters and impersonations, but they still make me laugh.  The plot itself is better then their usual fairy tale romance with Jafar making a truly evil villain.  The songs are some of their best and most memorable, especially the romantic song ""Whole New World.""  And the climax is one of my favorites because of how cleaver it is.  The animation is beautiful with vibrant colors bringing the story to life.

I've been looking forward to this DVD release since it was announced.  And let me tell you, it looks and sounds great.  Perfect widescreen, and the immersive audio mix is truly breathtaking.  Extras include two commentary tracks and a fun pop-up trivia option.  The story got quite an overhaul from the original version they were thinking of, and some of the original material is presented here, including a song recorded by Clay Aiken.  Disc two features a reunion of the producers, animators, and voice cast interspersed with behind the scenes material.  Honestly, this felt like it was leaving stuff out and could have been more in depth.  There's also a tribute to composure Alan Menken, games for kids, and the usual art galleries.  Most noticeably missing from the extras is Robin Williams.  With all the other principle voice cast returning for the extras, I was really disappointed not to hear from him.

This is a great movie in every sense of the word that everyone will enjoy watching many times.  While the extras don't seem quite as impressive as previous Platinum Edition titles, there's still plenty here for fans.  A disc well worth getting.",1102550400,,2104,4.777777777777778
524141,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is one of the last great animated films from Disney, and a lot of the credit is owed to the bad guys.  The voices of Jafar and Iago are dead-on perfect for their characters and when combined with Robin Williams in a role where he can really cut loose, they create movie gold.

In a classic poor-boy-makes-good story, it would be easy to ignore the villian and concentrate on the ""heart of gold"" and love-interest storylines, but directors Clements and Musker gave plenty of screen time for the wonderfully sneering and arrogant Jafar.  The interplay between him and Gottfried as Iago is nearly as fun as listening to Williams's wide selection of impressions and verbal explosions (my favorite is Bill Buckley with ""restrictions and quid pro quos"").

Some of the extras are snooze-inducing, but the commentary is engaging, especially if you've seen the film a few times.  This is definitely worth the upgrade from your old VHS copy.",1102377600,45,939,4.880503144654088
524142,5,6302787068,"Aladdin has never looked better.  This special edition DVD has all kinds of fun extras, deleted songs and scenes, games, and two hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  This boxed set not only comes with the platinum edition of Aladdin, but a little story book, and some of the original character sketches.

Most of the deleted songs and scenes are from the first story bored of the movie. This was when Aladdin was much younger, and had a mother.  ""Proud of Your Boy"" has become one of my favorite songs.  There are two games to play and few cute animated extras for the kids and those who are kids at heart, like me.  There are also interviews with almost every one that had a hand in the movie, and many more little extras that make this one of the best special edition Disney movies so far.

The little book is done with full color pictures and photos.  There are three chapters, a forward, and a storybook.  The book contains more behind the scenes facts and interviews. My favorite part though is the storybook of Aladdin with full color pictures.

The best part for me though was the character sketches.  Being an artist my self I love learning new techniques and looking at other professionals art work.  There is a sketch of each of the main characters that is signed by the main artist.  The sketches are not directly from the movie but how each of the artists portrayed their character.  And to put the icing on the cake each boxed set comes with a senitype of a piece of 35-millimeter film frame from the movie.  Mine happened to be of Jasmine and Aladdin flying on the magic carpet during the song a whole new world.

Overall the movie is a must bye if you are a Disney lover.  You may not want to spend the money on the gift box set for yourself, but if this is going to be a present for the holidays it is worth the money.",1101859200,3,1840,4.348973607038123

I know it sounds kinda weird in a psycho-kind-of-way, but it true.  If you were wondering, my other favorite movies include Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail and About a Boy.  I'm not all that werid.

I practically have the whole movie of Aladdin memorized, including Abu's non-sensical gibberish.  Every line should be treasured, because this movie is by far the best Disney movie.  Not to mention the voice of Aladdin is absolutley gorgeous.

Along with some of the best voce talents and jokes, this movie has some of the best songs ever too.  My personal favorite is One Jump Ahead, where all of Agrabah is trying to get Aladdin.  Along with One Jump Ahead are Whole New World, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali.  Wow.  With songs like that, why isn't Aladdin everyone's favorite movie?

So, if you want to take the advice of a 16 year old whose favorite movie is Aladdin, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!",1100908800,6,1016,4.4863387978142075
524144,5,6302787068,"The DVD picture and sound are fantastic.  I was surprised at how much better the picture looks compared to my (previously) treasured VHS copy.  The image is widescreen probably 1.78:1 vs. the old 1.33:1 so it gives about 20% more on each side and about 10% more on the top also. the bottom was kept about the same. (I compared a few scenes vs. the old VHS). looks great on an HDTV, showing delicate hues of color all over the place, unseen on the vhs copy.

The sound options are great, too.

Boxed set doesn't offer much value. it's priced a lot higher than the dvd alone, and all you get is a very average book where they even placed pictures over the spine of the book so it's right over Jasmine or Aladdin's body or head sometimes. The large section with the artists sketches is ok, but I didn't find a lot of value in those, unless you want a copy of each artist's autograph.  The negative is pretty nice if you own a scanner, but a photo of the same image on the box or insert would have been enough for me, so I don't think the extra money spend of those items is worth the extra value.  I got it because this is a one time release, though anyway and it's been a long wait for this to get to DVD.

They changed the artwork on the DVD, and that was unnecessary .  The original artwork they put on the VHS was better. On the DVD version they have Aladdin in his prince type outfit, but in this movie he's just got that blue vest the whole time so they shouldn't have changed the original artwork. The boxed set has the night scene of the 'cave of wonders' but I was hoping for artwork of the gang on the box. They should have put some of those great animated characters on the box like Aladdin, Jasmine and the rest of the characters instead of that cave.",1100563200,4,1760,4.171091445427729

524147,5,6302787068,"Aladdin is my favorite Disney film of all time, and when it came out in theaters I was obsessed with it, which is why I was thrilled when I heard that it was finally going to be released on DVD in October 2004.

Being such a huge fan of the film, I just had to get the deluxe edition set, and I was not disappointed.  The film is brilliantly rendered, with awesome sound and picture quality, the special features are incredibly entertaining and informative (I especially enjoyed the featurettes about the music of the film) and the artwork is wonderful to look at.  The music videos were neat, but honestly, I did not care for Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's version of ""A Whole New World"".  I'm sure Disney probably stuck it on there to appeal to the younger crowd, which is OK.  Besides, if you don't like it, thanks to DVD you can just elect not to watch it!  I really liked the deleted song ""Proud of Your Boy"", though:  both the original and the Clay Aiken version.

The book that accompanies the set is beautiful and very well done and the film cel is suitable for framing, as are the sketches.  I'd be proud to display them in my home, and hope to do so one day.

I was 15 when Aladdin came out in theaters in 1992, and I recently turned 27.  I can't believe so many years have passed since the film's release and it is still the most beloved Disney film to me.  Everyone will enjoy it, and I mean that.

The story is the same:  In the city of Agrabah, an evil sorcerer schemes to obtain the key to the Cave of Wonders and finds it in Aladdin, a 'street rat' who has to steal food from the marketplace in order to survive, along with his faithful companion Abu, a sweet and mischevious little monkey.  Aladdin meets Princess Jasmine, who escaped the palace so her life wouldn't be lived for her, and falls madly in love with her.  When he realizes she's the princess he's heartbroken because he thinks he would never be good enough for her, especially when he finds out Jasmine can only marry a prince.

Meanwhile, Jafar schemes to lure Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders to steal the lamp, planning to take it for himself once Aladdin is out.  The plan blows up in his face quite literally (thanks to Abu) and he must start again.  While in the cave, Aladdin meets the Carpet and of course the infamous Genie, voiced hilariously by Robin Williams (who ad-libbed most of his lines!), who launches into ""Friend Like Me"", which is my second favorite song on the soundtrack.  Genie and Carpet help Aladdin and Abu escape the cave, and Aladdin gets ready to make his three wishes.

Aladdin's first wish, of course, is to become a prince so that Jasmine would fall in love with him.  He takes Jasmine on a carpet ride (during ""A Whole New World"", my favorite song here) and they do fall in love, but Jafar schemes to stop it so he can marry Jasmine and rule as the Sultan.

Aladdin escapes Jafar's trap and saves the day, proving to the Sultan that he really is a prince inside, and the Sultan says that Jasmine can marry whoever she chooses.  Of course, she chooses Aladdin, and they live happily ever after.

I am so thrilled that this classic finally made it to DVD, and I encourage everyone who enjoyed it as much as I did (then and now) to buy this deluxe edition.  It is well worth the money, and you will treasure it for years to come.",1099872000,3,3342,4.35

I thought the bonus features on last year's ""Lion King"" DVD were much better, but there were some interesting things on the bonus DVD; there was one particulary good part where they go through the progression of the story, it was intersting to see where they had intended to take the movie originally.

I will say that for anyone who enjoyed this movie or has kids it is easily worth twenty bucks to have it in DVD.

The film itself is a masterpiece. It won two Academy Awards for its music and features a touching story and compelling cast of characters. The humor throughout the movie is spot-on, from the antics of Aladdin and the Genie (Robin Williams), to the cleverness of Princess Jasmine, and most definitely the bitingly witty remarks from the main villain Jafar and his sidekick parrot Iago (Gilbert Gottfried.) The entire movie has been remastered digitally with enhanced sound and is presented in widescreen. It is also close-captioned, or you can choose subtitles if you like.

One of the most talked about special features of the DVD set is ""Proud of Your Boy"" --- a song deleted from the movie after it was decided to remove Aladdin's Mother from the story. With the DVD version, you get the awesome music video of this song by Clay Aiken. However, you also get a bunch more interesting material including the original storyboards from the scene, a behind-the-scenes view, commentary from the people involved with the music, and the original recording of the song by Alan Menken. (Which in my opinion is as at least as good as Clay's, if not better.)

You'll also get three other deleted songs from the movie, as well as a new music video of ""A Whole New World"" and another bonus music video of it from 1992.

There's much more to explore also. You'll get to see ""A Diamond in the Rough: The Making of Aladdin,"" which takes you inside the special effects, the music, the cast and casting and much more. There are several games and fun features, some more interesting than others: Aladdin's Magic Carpet Adventure, Inside the Genie's Lamp, The Genie World Tour and 3 Wishes Game.

You'll also get movie stills, Pop-Up Fun Facts, and many other features. This is definitely one not to miss, if you're an Aladdin fan, or simply want to check out a great DVD.",1098489600,33,2047,4.675
524152,4,6302787068,"Remember the good old days of Walt Disney animation? When favorite childhood fairy tales could magically be brought to life on the silver screen year after year? Well, times have certainly changed and not for the better. The last great effort from the studio, one that would unanimously be declared a classic, would have to be 1994's The Lion King, which went on to be the highest grossing animated film of all time, until recently when both Finding Nemo and Shrek 2 were released. Since then Disney traditional animation hit the skids - Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules - these weren't particularly bad films, they just never quite matched up with the quality, or box office bonanza, that either Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, or The Little Mermaid generated. Sure, the occasional success would come along - Mulan, Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch - but there were also plenty of features, as well intentioned and entertaining as they may be, that failed to even recoup their budgets - Fantasia 2000, The Emperor's New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire - and with computer animation taking off like a rocket in those years, the death knoll for the genre was ringing. Looking back on films such as Aladdin, when traditional animation was king again, it is sad to contemplate the fate and destination that the Walt Disney Company, which pioneered the genre back in 1937, is heading toward today.

The story for Aladdin follows the simple storybook procedures - boy meets girl, boy rescues girl from villain, boy becomes hero and wins the girl, etc. - but does manage to offer interesting twists on what would ordinarily be predictable conventions. A long time ago in the city of Agrabah in what would be the modern Middle-East, a gentle-hearted street urchin names Aladdin finds himself in the midst of an adventure he never could have imagined. It begins when Princess Jasmine, daughter to the Sultan, grows agitated of palace life and her being forced to choose among several suitors, prominent peacock princes, the man the law condemns her to marry by her next birthday. After she escapes one night over the palace walls and receives some much needed help from the street-wise Aladdin, her escapade creates even more trouble when it cause the young boy to be thrown in jail and, supposedly, beheaded. Aladdin, desperate to win the attention of the princess, accepts an offer from a sinister sorcerer to go into the Cave of Wonders, a legendary place filled with immense treasures beyond imagination, in order to retrieve a particular item for him. Jafar, the Sultan's royal advisor, has plans to take from the Cave of Wonders a mysterious lamp which houses a magical genie that grants the owner of the lamp any three wishes he wants - with a few exceptions of course. But when the lamp falls into the hands of the young street rat, things become more complicated and the traitorous advisor has further competition for the throne. Aladdin must now face the truth, both with the princess and himself, in order to set the world straight and save the day.

The story for Aladdin works brilliantly for what it is, a well executed re-imagining of a classic storybook fairy tale with hilarious performances, enchanting songs, and a clear-cut moral lesson that wraps up everything neatly and cleanly. The better question that should be asked is whether it is predictable - at times, excruciatingly so, but, in the end, does it really matter all that much? Not at all, whether it be the smallest child or the oldest adult viewing this film. Let's face facts here, this is intended to be a children's film, there isn't much any filmmaker can do with this film that isn't going to bland and cookie cutter-ish to someone of the older set. Honestly, forget those people! Aladdin does what it's suppose to do - make us laugh, have in tears (pass the hanky), and lift up emotionally whenever the story demands it to. There isn't a single frame that feels out of place and any animated film that can do that and maintain that credibility for several years deserves all the praise it gets.

The role of Aladdin, voiced eloquently by Scott Weinger, sets the proper tempo for the entire feature and represents a beacon of moral clarity throughout the film without having to be elaborate or over the top in nature to demonstrate that. Yes, it would have nice if the character hadn't been designed as a ""Tom Cruise-like"" pretty boy (not to say he should have been ugly but a little more common man-ish would have been better), but beggars can't be choosers, no pun intended. With that aside, the point of living up to your moral standards and not letting external appearances change the person you truly are inside is made crystal clear throughout the film by this emotionally driven hero. This especially hits hard to home for audience members who find themselves with their own ""princess"" in mind. Even when everything seems to be wrapped up neatly for Aladdin - Jasmine adores him, the Sultan believes him to be the proper suitor and next sultan, and no problems currently block his way to what he believed was ""happiness"" - he can't help but feel morally guilty about the whole situation. He holds it in himself as best he can until he put up with this false charade any longer and goes to tell Jasmine the truth, only to be interrupted by a rather large problem. The point is made though - as the Bible once noted, the truth can set you free, and that should always be a person's best policy no matter what the situation or what it may cost you. The most notable highlight of the film is without a doubt the phenomenal ""Genie of the Lamp""! Right here, direct from the lamp - Thank you! Joking aside - The Genie, voiced brilliantly by well-known comedian Robin Williams, is one of the most vivacious, astonishing, lighthearted, and flat-out memorable characters to blaze the silver screen in a Disney animated film in decades, and possibly for years to come as well. There was a rumor going around that after Robin Williams came in to do the record session for the Genie, the directors of the film were left with nearly sixteen hours worth of material! For anyone who has seen one of his comedy shows, like the one that was presented on HBO not too long ago, this shouldn't come as a surprise. It would wonderful if Disney were to release that material one day but there's serious doubt that would ever happen - Williams has been pretty strict about his role with the film and Disney has been on thin ice with him for several years.

Overall, Aladdin, though seemingly like any other storybook fare, defied conventions and raised the bar when it came to all future animated films from that moment on, which, to this day, has yet to be lived up to. Despite clearly being predictable and often over the top in nature, Aladdin achieves an almost uncertainty in modern cinema, which being able to work those discrepancies to its advantage in creating a purely entertaining feature film for all ages, as the genre began. And it doesn't hurt in the least that certain lessons are picked up from the film along the way, each applying to varying degree of audience members. For example, the film becomes a true wake-up call for all us pathetic saps out there who still fail to grasp the concept of what women want. Women aren't superficial, despite what the Paris Hiltons of the world may make you believe. Many would rather spend the rest of their lives with a poor honest man then a man who relies solely on vain appearances and a relationship built up by lies. Is it pathetic that someone can pick this up from an animated film intended for children? Yes, but wherever one can get helpful advice that works, use it and apply it whenever you can. Honestly, this can be stressed eloquently enough in today's society - Don't waste an opportunity to be with someone when you have it in front of you and be honest if you do follow through with it. As long as you honest with yourself and the person you are with, all the disadvantages in the world can't change the person you truly are inside.",1098489600,2,8072,4.690409026798307

Robin Williams (The Genie) Gilbert Godfrey (Parrot)a sure fire way to tell if Disney has a hit is if my children learn it word for word and this like so many others are major hits in our home!",1097452800,2,1041,4.335051546391752
524161,5,6302787068,"...I still have to chastise Disney for caving in and editing the lyrics in the opening tune (Arabian Nights): they removed ""Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face"" and replaced it something like ""Where the desert is immense and the heat is intense."" (You can hear the correctly sung line on the CD soundtrack and on the laserdisc version.) The redubbing of the line sounds stilted and noticeably out of timbre.

Wimps! All the same, it's one of my favorites from Disney and still makes me laugh ten years after I first saw it.",1097452800,3,544,4.494949494949495
524162,5,6302787068,"This is my favorite Disney animanted film, partly because (and as much as like Cinderella and Snow White) this story wasn't about the helpless female in rags waiting around for Prince Charming to come and sweep her off her feet. It was, in a way, just the opposite. The poor ""street rat"" finds ""Princess Charming."" Robin Williams as the Genie was hiliarious and Jonathan Freeman did an excellent job voicing the villian and Gilbert Gottfried as his sidekick parrot. The special features include deleted songs and scenes; interviews with the voice talents, directors, animators and song composer Alan Menken. It takes you through the entire process of making the movie.",1097452800,,668,5.081818181818182
524163,4,6302787068,"Aladdin would not have been what it is without the talented Robin Williams.  The songs ARE great and the story is good, but it still retains a bit of the Saturday-morning-cartoon feel, mainly because of the voice acting which is a bit overdone.  The other classics that preceded this one, like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast still seem a cut above.  Otherwise, this is a great movie with a good message to kids and adults alike.  Also, if you're someone who watches all of the special features on DVD's there are some good bonuses which give a real inside look into what it takes to make an animated film and some insights into what the movie could have been including an original plot line that included Aladdin's mother, a few deleted songs and a heartfelt reminder of the tragic loss of song-writer Howard Ashman, who, along with Alan Menken was basically responsible for the resurgence of the animated musical.  All in all, this is a great DVD if you are a fan of the film or of animated musicals in general.",1097193600,4,1025,4.548913043478261

Aladdin is a great story and one of my favourite disney movies but this special edition is wonderfully crystal clear, sounds are amazing  and colours just so vibrant and i am very happy i bought it.

the jessica simpson/nick lachay remake duet of whole new world does not match up to the original,the original video is there too and it is so nice to see peabo bryson and regina bell.

524166,5,6302787068,"Aladdin"" continued Disney's hot streak of family friendly but witty animated classics that broke box office records. Unfortunately, the magic was to last for a couple more movies. No small part of the success of ""Aladddin"" can be attributed to the songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Menken and Ashman (who also wrote the winning songs for ""Beauty and The Beast"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors""). Also, the witty self assured direction, like that of ""Beauty and The Beast"", helped define a hip, new Disney that had something for everyone.

So what's the difference between the ""Special Editon"" and the ""Special Edition Gift Set"". Plenty but as to whether it's worth the extra cost depends on how much of a fan you are of the film. The ""Special Edition"" comes only with the DVDs (the featurettes and documentaries are discussed below). The ""Special Edition Gift Set"" comes with all that plus six original illustrations on heavy stock of characters from the film. You also get a deluxe book that's housed in a slipcase. It's very nice, indeed. Now, if I were Disney I also would have included the soundtrack and also made this edition a numbered, limited edition. While it might grow in value until the next generation of disc players come out and this is re-released yet again for Blu-Ray discs, it would have been better for fans to do a limited numbered edition. Oh, and I forgot the film frame from the original movie.

""Aladdin"" looks great on DVD with sharp, clear images and bright, vivid colors. I didn't detect any analog or digital blemishes worth noting. The Disc looks even better than the laserdisc version issued nearly a decade ago and worlds better than the VHS with crisper, clearer sound and a much cleaner more vivid (and colorful)picture. The ""Disney Enhanced"" 5.1 soundtrack actually improves the dialogue and songs giving them better clarity and added presence.

The extras are a mixed bag but most of them are well worth having. There's deleted scenes presented in rough pencil animation, deleted songs highlighted by the terrific ""Proud of Your Boy"". Clay Aiken sings a version of the song for a music video. We also get ""A Whole New World"" performed by the dipsy duo of Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. The two hour ""A Diamond in the Rough"" is a fascinating glimpse behind-the-scenes of this marvelous movie. We also get to see scenes from the deleted storyline for the film. Pop-up trivia facts can also be programmed to play on the DVD player as well. The two audio commentary tracks feature the directors and producer of the film while the second has some very funny commentary from the various character animators involved in the film.

""Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride"" is the best of the extras included here. It's actually not a game per se but a magic carpet ride that's best experienced on as big a TV as possible with the lights out. It's as close to a thrill ride ever presented on home video. ""Inside the Genie's Lamb"" is a mildly interesting and entertaining glimpse into the Genie's habitat. We also get ""Genie World Tour"". This bit of whimsy is fun and Disney directors actually entertained the notion of putting it on during the end credits at one time. It's clever and a witty short. ""3 Wishes Game"" might keep little ones entertained once or twice although some little ones will need help operating the DVD remote to play the game. Parents stay close by so the kids don't throw the remote at the TV in frustration. You can also select your favorite ""Aladdin"" songs with onscreen lyrics to help you sing along (God save your neighbors if you're a bad singer).

All in all a terrific package well worth picking up. ""Aladdin"" is a funny, charming and entertaining movie with the Disney team at their peak. The ""Special Gift Edition"" is truly for the hardcore Disney fan that collects everything Disney. The two disc ""Special Edition"" is more for the casual fan or those that love the movie but just don't collect Disney stuff. I had some reservations about the DVD release as I was afraid they might screw it up but they didn't. The only thing missing is a discussion about the original song lyrics that were changed for home video release due to concerns about their anti-Arab sentiments. Also, we don't get any new footage of Robin Williams but we do see some vintage stuff from his very funny recording sessions.",1097020800,94,4361,4.74802110817942
524167,5,6302787068,"When Aladdin came out in theatres in 1992, I was quite skeptical to say the least about seeing it in the theatres.  After all, I was 19 years old and thought I was much too old to be seen in a theatre with a bunch of kids.  I had not even yet seen Beauty and the Beast.  After seeing Aladdin, I was totally re-won over.  The story, music, characters, everything about it was so wonderful.

The DVD is that and so much more.  The picture is so clear and brilliant, it is almost like seeing it for the first time.  The extras are spectacular.  The videos (most of them anyway) are great.  It was cool to see the original video from 1992 for A Whole New World.  Mr. Aiken (always a pleasure to watch) once again delivers a powerful redering of the deleted ""Proud of Your Boy.""  I guess the sweet newlyweds were fine for the new video of WNW...but totally unnecessary.  At least we did not get the obligatory teeny bopper stars of Disney Channel shows ruining a song...YUCK!!

Proud of Your Boy is a beautiful song that truely must have been gut-wrenching to cut from the film.  However, as the creators stated, it would have taken the plot in a completely different direction.  I only hope that an audio recording will be available soon with Clay singing it.

Overall, a must have for any fan of the remarkable Platinum Edition Disney masterpieces for the kid in all of us.",1097020800,6,1370,4.398406374501992

The concept of the movie is Aladdin is a street commoner who steals to survive with his pet monkey Abu. He dreams of living inside the palace and all its wonder. Inside though, princess Jasmine is tired of the confines of the palace and wants to be free to explore the world. These two meet and instantly a relationship is formed.

524169,5,6302787068,"I was 13 when this movie first came out.  When I saw the trailers for it, I was sure it would be really stupid, but when I saw it, I fell in love with it.  It is, in my opinion part of Disney's best years.  My favorite movies from Disney fall somewhere between The Little Mermaid and Mulan (with a few in the middle I didn't like).  Robin Williams makes a great genie.  His comic timing is great, and being in a Disney film, his jokes are clean as well.  Jafar is a great villain.  He has the snakelike smoothness about him that is great in a villain.  He also has a great voice for a villain.  This movie is definitely one you want to watch.",1096934400,,642,4.031746031746032
524170,5,6302787068,"The Aladdin movie is loosely based on a story in the book ""The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights"". Aladdin is a  street rat that must live by his wits. He seems mostly like a good person that is lowered to being a thief to eat. More of a Robin Hood thief, he gives away more than he takes. When he meets Princess Jasmine his life is changed forever. His love for her makes him desire changing his life even more than before and it motivates him to find the treasure that will make him a Prince. There is only one problem, an evil Grand Vizier by the name of Jafar and his pet parrot Lago want the treasure as well. Fortunately Aladdin has his monkey Abu and Jasmine to help him. Don't miss how they beat Jafar and Lago.

My whole family was excited to get this DVD. Don't wait to get it yourself since Disney is still putting them in the vault for about eight years after they have sold the set number of copies. I don't think this one will last on the shelves that long since it is a wonderful story of adventure and romance. The incredible bright colored animation and music are definitely high points. The comedy of Robin Williams as the Genie is over the top. When you start looking at all the features of this two disc platinum set you will realize this is a wonderful gift to your family or someone elses. This is one of the best of all the Disney classics. Most people that enjoyed ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" will want to add this to their DVD collection.",1096934400,2,1497,4.249122807017544

The voice talent is excellent and the animation is eye popping.  Fans of Disneyana and/or Aladdin in particular will especially enjoy this 2 DVD set.",1096848000,,487,4.914634146341464

It's kind of sad that they haven't put out anything as good as this lately, but I have hope that one day they will.

Robin Williams steals the movie as The Genie.  He is my all time favorite Disney character and he is in top form here.  The rest of the cast is great, especially Gilbert Gottfried as Iago.  The soundtrack is full of some catchy and upbeat music that I bought the CD and wore it out and then bought another!

Some of the Arab characters do seem a little bit stereotyped, but nothing too offensive.

Also I'm sure the DVD packaging will be great.  Disney has really improved at packaging their DVD's and including interesting and worthwhile ""extras.""

524173,4,6302787068,"In the best attempt at emulating the traditions of the studio's all time great features, Walt Disney's ""Aladdin"" recants the tales of the Arabian Nights in typical musical style. The story concerns a young, devilishly handsome Middle Eastern street urchin, Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger) and his desire to be anything but what he is. Desiring to romance the feisty feminist of the royal house, Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin), Aladdin soon discovers himself in a heap of trouble at the hand of the Grand Vizier Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). All seems lost until Aladdin stumbles upon the mythical cave of wonders - a fabulously wealthy cavern inhabited by the fast-talking, sharp-shooting jack of all genies (Robin Williams).

Saddle-bagged with the inheritance of the Disney tradition, directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, are desperately grappling to find either a hit film or, at least, hit song (a la ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty & The Beast""). But more often than not the film digresses into mere homage or parody of Disney's previous efforts. Consider the parallels in musical styling between `A Whole New World' (Aladdin) and `Kiss The Girl' (The Little Mermaid) or the Genie's Busby Berkeley-esque `Friend Like Me' in juxtaposition with `Be Our Guest' (Beauty & The Beast). In concocting his performance as the Genie, the animators fall back on parodying everyone from Ed Sullivan to Pinocchio. Ironically, the Genie emerges as the most fully realized character in the film. Famed Warner contract player, Conrad Veidt was the inspiration for the villainous Jafar. Yet Jafar is more a caricature or copying of Veidt rather than a stand alone menacing force of evil as say ""Sleeping Beauty's"" Maleficent. Gilbert Gottfried provides an attractive diversion as Iago, Jafar's parrot, but here a comparison in both animation style and character structure is too obvious with the loony goony sea gull (voiced by Buddy Hackett) from ""The Little Mermaid."" Thus the sum totem of Aladdin is more as a clap-trap of previous Disney efforts, rather than its own unique and engaging film experience.  Some might recall that the film's score came under scrutiny from Islamic fundamentalists who felt that the line ""they cut of your nose if they don't like your face; it's barbaric but, hey, it's home"" falsely represented their cultural identity as a whole as crude and foreboding. The line was eventually altered on video copies to read, `where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense; it's barbaric but hey, it's home.""

Disney DVD delivers a very pleasing anamorphic presentation. Colors are extremely bold and vibrant. Black and contrast levels are deep, rich and solid. The vibrancy of the image is to be admired.  There are no age related artifacts and very few digital anomalies for a picture that is remarkably smooth.  The audio has been cleaned up and remixed to 5.1 surround. It's aggressive and powerful, delivering a thrill ride experience in your living room that few live action sound mixes of late have been capable of rivaling. Extras include several thorough and interesting commentary tracks, an all too brief making of that is definitely geared more toward the under 13 category, some child's play vignettes and some DVD-rom junket materials that, quite simply, you can do without.",1096502400,,3305,5.12430426716141
524174,4,6302787068,"""Aladdin,"" though still a good movie, sadly seems a bit out-of-date now because Disney ruined the franchise with all those direct-to-video sequels and because the Genie impressions and cultural jokes are from the early '90s.

The story is solid, the message is clear, the villain is good and the music is great.

But it hasn't aged as well as other timeless Disney classics, like the grand ""Beauty and the Beast."" So this DVD is getting loaded with modern ""extras"" to help market it to an audience of children that wasn't alive when ""Aladdin"" and its 3,000 or so spinoffs was released.

Now, in addition to the corny, overwrought Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle version of ""A Whole New World,"" Disney gives us Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson doing a similarly overwrought cover. Is this progress?

And, as for resurrecting ""Proud of Your Boy,"" a song originally written by Menken and Ashman to Aladdin's mother (because when the original storyboards were drawn up, he wasn't an orphan), I'd be more excited if it wasn't being sung by ""American Idol"" instant celebrity Clay Aiken.

The movie of 12 years ago won points for being culturally of-the-moment, but now it's dated. These DVD extras, while making the DVD of-the-moment, may cause the movie the same problems 12 years from now.

524175,5,6302787068,"In 1992, Disney got their wish with the splendid animated blockbuster ""Aladdin"". In the kingdom of Agrabah, street-wise Aladdin dreams of a better life and falls for the spirited Princess Jasmine. With the help of the wise-cracking Genie of the Lamp (voiced by Robin Williams), Aladdin becomes a dashing rich prince to win Jasmine's hand but the sinister Jafar plots to use the power of the Lamp to rule the kingdom. ""Aladdin"" is pure crowd-pleasing family entertainment. The thirty-first Disney animated feature became an instant favorite with critics and audiences in 1992, and one of Disney's highest grossing films with over $500 million worldwide. ""Aladdin"" contains an enchanting story, memorable characters, great humor and a marvelous music score. The voice cast is wonderful with Robin Williams delivering an over-the-top comic performance.

524178,5,6302787068,"Ever since the Little Mermaid's unexpected success, Disney's been cranking out films every 2-3 years and after Beauty and the Beast they worked on Aladdin. Was a smash hit despite not having any name actors, although Robin Williams is recognizable, and a bit of controversy with one of the opening lyrics. What was also different was the approach to the story. Disney always had films that were self-contained: no pop culture references. Here Genie is doing imitations left and right and it was quite different but yet it worked.

Aladdin, a street rat(basically a less-offensive word for ""bum""), dreams of living in a luxurious lifestyle without having to steal for food and avoiding guards while doing so. Jasmine, the sultan's daughter and princess, wishes to choose whomever she marrys without it being forced unto her. Chance encounter makes them run into each other and he falls in love(of course).

Meanwhile, Jafar is after a treasure in the Cave of Wonders but not just anyone can enter, it has to be a ""diamond in the rough"", which just happens to be Aladdin. Aladdin is trapped in the cave but stumbles upon an hyperactive Genie in a magical lamp and realizes that the way to get to Jasmine is to make himself a prince. Jafar finds the lamp however and Aladdin must stop him without the use of the Genie.

Before the realistic Lion King(well as far as talking animals go, there was no magical powers a la Cinderella or 50 story villains like Ursula or Maleficent), Aladdin continues with its sense of wonder where anything can happen. Props has to be given to Robin Williams, who goes as fast as rapper who drank too much coffee, he's non-stop here. The soundtrack is incredibly catchy but oddly there was something different in this one. Ursula had Poor Unfortunate Souls, Gaston(Beauty and the Beast) had well, Gaston, and Scar from Lion King had Be Prepared, yet Jafar didn't get his own song. Considering Disney usually likes to get the villain to sing, that was odd but oh well. Also Jonathan Freeman, voice of Jafar gives a very good performance here.

I don't know if Disney's doing it's entire catalogue with the Platinum edition stuff(they're almost up to 40 already) but this was a good addition. On the way we have Bambi in march, I believe Cinderella next year, then Jungle Book, 101 Dalmations and Lady and the Tramp I think in the coming years.

524182,5,6302787068,"Disney's Platinum Editions are rapidly becoming a must buy not only for the Disney enthusiast, but also the general film buff. The annual release of the Disney top titles with a whole new set of extras spanning over two discs is now a real date-for-the-diary. The latest for the Platinum treatment is Aladdin - one of Disney's biggest hits of the 'Golden Era' (now sadly ended).

The film deserves it's fame and success. Beautifully written,designed and animated, the studio should now look back at it and see how it should be done. The songs by Ashman and Menken (with help from Tim Rice post Ashman's death)are excellent without a weak link among them. The same can be said for the vocal talent on display. Although Robin Williams' Genie has always received the most praise and attention, my personal favourites are Jonathon Freeman's witty Jafar and Gilbert Gottfried's abrasive Iago.

The extras, looking at the line-up, don't seem as exhaustive (and exhausting!) as Lion King or Beauty and the Beast's but there definately seems to be an emphasis of quality over quantity. The main attraction on these discs is always the never-before-heard songs. Unlike the previously mentioned films, Aladdin will not have the songs intergrated into the film. This is probably due to the fact that the main deleted song (Proud of your Boy) was originally to be sung by a character that did not survive into Aladdin's final scipt - Aladdin's mother. The reprise (Humiliate your Boy) was to be sung by Jafar which seems to point to both versions being replaced somewhat by Prince Ali and it's Jafar sung reprise.

A commentary by the Disney artists is always welcome and the Howard Ashman tribute should be another highlight. A lot of the extras seem to be depressingly child-friendly (hopefully this won't alienate the buffs) with the Magic Carpet Ride sounding like a carbon-copy of the poular Timon and Pumbaa Safaris available on the Lion King releases. An in-depth making of sounds wonderful but I for one could have lived without the pathetic padding that is the 'All New Music Video'.

With Bambi apparently the next for the full platinum treatment and 101 Dalmations, Jungle Book and Little Mermaid to follow (one per year and just in time for Christmas!)

524186,5,6302787068,"(Sorry if it seems boring at first, but don't worry, I get to the point.)
 I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was sitting on our video shelf upstairs, and, despite having this movie for years, I had never watched it. My sister was babysitting me(she had moved out of the house) and it was a special time for both of us. We wanted to watch a movie, and  she brought ""Aladdin"" downstairs. I informed her that I had never seen this movie, before, and that I wasn't sure that I would like it. My sister told me that this was a good movie, so I agreed.
 Boy, am I glad that I did! From the first scene(with the merchant displaying his products), I knew I would enjoy ""Aladdin"". To this day it is one of my favorite movies of all time(and I'm a teenager!). Why do I like it so much? Three reasons:
1) The plot. Even as a kid, I loved the romance, laughed at  the jokes(excluding some of the many references by Genie, of course), and experienced the emotions of the scenes as the crew intended.
2) The voices. The characters just seem so real! From The Sultan- a joyful, peppy, and funny little fellow- to Jafar- who doesn't seem as real as the others, but, I admit, the way he is presented in this movie is kind of hard to work with. I absolutely LOVE the voices! They are so good at portraying the characters!
3) The soundtrack. I am completely in love with the soundtrack(I have the original CD and the Spanish version of it. Can you tell I'm obsessed?). Kudos to Lea Salonga and Brad Kane. ""A Whole New World"" is by far the best Disney vocal song EVER when it comes to romance(in my humble opinion).

I saw this movie in the theater with 2 friends when it was first released. There were a number of people in the audience including a lot of young children. The vast majority of laughs came from the adults including the 3 of us. This is a GREAT movie. Robin Williams is perfect. Kids will enjoy this movie, but it will be the adults that will appreciate the humor and probably end up liking it more than the kids.
I can't believe that over the last 14 years since its theatrical release it hasn't been released on DVD. It will be a long wait till October.

524191,3,6302787068,"When Disney's Aladdin was released on videotape and laserdisc for the first time in October 1993, it debuted with a PC alteration, immediately into the film, as a line from the opening song was changed because of concerns over Arab stereotyping - ""Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face"" became the neutral ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense"".
As the film makes is debut on DVD later this year, prepare for more changes, albeit subtle.  Just like they did with The Lion King, the Disney team is not using the original theatrical presentation of the film, but a re-issue created for IMAX theatres, which featured some redrawn sequences, supposedly necessary because the original footage in question was problematic on the giant IMAX screen (Examples of the changes to The Lion King can be easily found on the web). The difference this time around is that no one ever saw it.  The IMAX presentations were financially unrewarding to Disney, and Aladdin was never shown.
The original release had wonderful color composition, especially in the opening scenes introducing Jafar and the Cave Of Wonders, and Pixar's digital images of The Cave's exterior would foreshadow their upcoming quality feature work that Disney would distribute. As far as casting, it sounds like Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried had a great time cutting loose in the studio.
With few exceptions, this film is a delight from start to finish.  The  low rating comes from the fact that the original theatrical version will not be used, but the redrawn IMAX version.  It deserves to be part of your collection, but not like this...",1078531200,460,1635,4.909420289855072

He also falls in love with Jasmine,daughter of the sultan of Agrabah. But not all is peaceful,for the vizier Jafar,along with his wisecracking parrot,Iago,plan disaster upon the Sultan,Jasmine and all of Agrabah.

Even the recent Finding Nemo didn't hold a candle to it in my eyes. You'll laugh, you'll cry and then you'll probably laugh again! Iago and the Genie are two of the greatest characters ever in any Disney movie. I love it because the characters aren't so one dimensional. Jasmine is more then just a pretty princess waiting for a man to come rescue her. She's strong willed and fiery.

524195,5,6302787068,"""Aladdin"" is one of Disney's more underappreciated movies. I'm still puzzled as to why ""Beauty and the Beast"" has soared to popularity but ""Aladdin"" has not. B&B does have somewhat more lucid and appealing animation yet its forgettable songs, complete absense of a plot, worst of all, its so-called villain, little more than a rejected stud, put that movie to shame. ""Aladdin"" is a much more mature work thanks to both Genie's (voiced by Robin Williams) non-stop spoofs and pranks and Disney's most delectable pair of bad guys: the elegant Grand Vizier Jafar (Jonothan Freeman) and his big-mouthed, comfort-loving parrot sidesick Iago (Gilbert Gottfried). Aladdin himself is a bit bland, but who could notice in this whirl of golden-tinted animation and mystery, not to mention singing? ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"" have both proved to be hit songs over the years. It is only fitting that the movie itself receive its share of fame.",1076630400,4,937,5.051612903225807

The main characters original goals, stealing to eat and survive, shifted smoothly to his love for Jasmine, the sultans daughter. Using his ""street smarts"" combined with cunning, ingenuity,(and a little help from a big genie)he wins the hearts of the people AND the princess. What makes this story so classic is the fact that Aladdin's motivation never included riches and gold, or becoming the ruler of anything...he wanted nothing more than the love of Jasmine.

The soundtrack, although not as moving as that of The Lion King is still very good and very suited to the film.
I can't believe it's taking Disney so long to release Aladdin on DVD either. Here in the UK they released a special edition of Beauty and the Beast about a year ago and now they have jumped to releasing the Lion King. I'd be interested to know why Aladdin wasn't released on DVD before the Lion King as it was made first.

When Aladdin wishes to be a prince, he tries desperately to win the heart of the beautiful Princess Jasmine.
The animation in this film is breathtaking, particularly the palace which Princess Jasmine lives in and the cave in which Aladdin discovers the genie's lamp. All the music in this film is great fun for the kids, and the musical numbers are surprisingly fun, not stupid.
Also great about Aladdin are the voices. Gilbert Godfrey and Robin Williams provide endless humor as a Eago the parrot and Genie, the genie (respectively). All of the voices, however, fit the film perfectly.

And I loved how Iago was the perfect foil to Jafar, a serious villain.  I also enjoyed the love story that unravels around Aladdin and Jasmine.  Jasmine is the girl that every guy wants, and Aladdin is the sweet, handsome young man that every girl dreams of.  I also enjoyed the personifications of the carpet, and his expressions.

With skepticism being one of my natural traits, I investigated this film, as I did after hearing rumors of the same type of thing in films like the Lion King and The Little Murmaid. Well, in Aladin, it's so blatantly obvious that the viewer can't help but laugh.
It's the balcony scene, right as the princess comes out from her room and walks past the curtains. You can hear a voice, although quiet and somewhat hushed, say, ""Good teenagers take off your clothes.""  Don't believe me? Listen to it yourself and make sure to listen carefully.
Unlike the ""ghost"" that is supposedly in Three Men and a Baby and the midget ""hanging himself"" in The Wizard of Oz, Aladin provides us with solid, undeniable evidence that some Disney cartoon editors have a little too much fun with their jobs.

It's very entertaining, funny, gorgeously animated, and tolerable-if not enjoyable-for every family member.  One thing though, some parts may be too scary for very little ones.  Conclusively, it is my favorite Disney movie.",1025568000,,374,4.888888888888889

524247,5,6302787068,"""Aladdin"" is another delightful Disney classic, with a simple plot, which is easier to follow on than 'Beauty and the Beast.' A ""street rat"" homeless young man, Aladdin, is targeted for opening a magical cave by a sinister adviser, Jafar. Inside the cave lies piles of treasure. But the most precious item in the cave that Jafar wants-a magic lamp with a genie (voiced by the scene-stealing Robin Williams).
A movie that ranks along with 'Beauty and the Beast' with its delightful animation, genuine suspense, wonderful score by Alan Menken and Tim Rice, hilarious one-liners by Gilbert Gottifried (Jafar's wise-cracking pet parrot) and the Genie, sweet romantic songs, and a plot that will please adults as well as the kiddies.
A movie that doesn't exactly exceed the original plot that the wonderful 'Beauty and the Beast' had, ""Aladdin"" succeeds by wit and charm, and is in a way, great.",1012867200,,890,4.97986577181208
