6791249,5,B00P9UVDDE,"Thanks to Shout!  Factory for finally making the last two seasons of this great and classic sitcom available on DVD and for allowing us fans to purchase these two seasons individually without buying the whole series as we already own the first four seasons.  I now look forward to individually purchasing ""WKRP In Cincinatti,"" ""Mama's Family"" and ""The Jeffersons"" season-by-season.",1424390400,,381,5.333333333333333

6791251,4,B00P9UVDDE,"At least in this case, waiting paid off. I resisted buying the Bob Newhart Complete Series Set because I already owned 1 - 4, so I was very pleased when 5 and 6 became available separately. The BNS got even funnier as it progressed through time, so Season 5 has some wonderfully funny episodes. A must for all Newhart fans.",1423872000,,323,4.4
6791252,5,B00P9UVDDE,"Bravo Shout! Factory for releasing seasons 5 and 6 for those of us who had been purchasing the individual seasons.  Great move. I'd like to mention that the video quality is excellent as well.

The Bob Newhart Show is one of those ""must have"" comedy classics.  I can't help but laugh at Bob's subtle, uptight, quirky humor, paired with Emily's playful goofiness.  A great tv marriage!  Then, when you add in the stellar grouping of zany friends and neurotic patients, it makes for hilarious episodes that we will never forget.  This is what comedy was meant to be and will never be again.  Highly recommend this series!",1423699200,5,619,4.728971962616822
6791253,5,B00P9UVDDE,"just orderd 5&6! i too, waited it out and Shout!

6791280,1,B00P9UVDDE,"OMG How Disappointing!!  After waiting for this season to be finally be available on DVD, and to be such AWFUL, HORRID quality of reproduction.  The other reviewers are absolutley correct - Get the first four seasons on DVD, produced professionally, or stream them where available, and they have sharp video with full sound.  These appear to be off-the-air bootlegs, both the video AND audio are fuzzy & flat, not remastered or even cleaned at all.  Shame on you Shout TV - for ruining an excellent TV series.",1440201600,4,509,4.816091954022989

6791284,1,B00P9UVDDE,"Last year, I hit the jackpot at Sam's Club.  They had the first four seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" for $14.99 each.  Those DVD's came in a case, and the discs were contained in two different and independent sleeves within it.  I enjoyed them immensely, and I watched them over and over.  When I ordered this season of the show from Amazon, I didn't pay attention to the company who'd compiled the season.  It's named ""SHOUT.""  The first four seasons are made by another producer, likely related to the original show.  I am disappointed in this season.  I can't watch more than one episode at a time.  They aren't as funny.  I wondered if the quality of the show had lessened over time, but my memory was that the series was always great, right through to the end.  I didn't know that the quality of the reproduction could make such a difference.  You can tell that the canned laughter is canned.  It should be toned down so that the characters and their lines are predominant.  I'm going to look and/or wait for the seasons 5 & 6 when it's produced by the same group as the first four.  I'd normally say to buy it if you really want to watch the show.  Here, I'd recommend not purchasing this version from SHOUT.  I'd say to purchase seasons 1-4 and to enjoy those.  The poor quality diminishes the pleasure of watching the show, and I'll likely just put it aside.  I may watch it through to see if the quality is as bad as it seems, but I'm already close to the end of disc 2 and it's not getting any better.  If it's important to you to have the DVDs stored in separate disc containers, as are most good quality sets, you won't like this.  The case is cheap, and the discs don't stay well on the circular holder in the middle of the case.  I've shopped at Amazon for at least 10 years.  This is only my second bad review.  The first had to do with the product simply not working.  My review here is based on disappointment at not having the enjoyment that I'd had with the first four seasons.  That's the heart of entertainment, though, so the disappointment  with a show that I know is excellent is a sign of a bad product.",1437436800,4,2130,4.313131313131313
6791285,4,B00P9UVDDE,"My less than perfect rating is for the condition my package arrived in. The spine of the dvd holder inside had broken, and my discs were loose. Luckily they were not scratched, but it makes the package worthless for holding my discs now. This is not the first time this has happened to me, I wish they would stop using this inferior package design.

This show is excellent though, I highly recommend it.",1436832000,,403,4.52054794520548
6791286,5,B00P9UVDDE,"Love Bob!  Drawl; understated; Dull, Boring, Control Hysteria!  His dead-pan approach has always been hysterical!  Thanks Bob for so many years of understated humor.  We love you!  Dave (in Colorado)",1436745600,,199,5.5
6791287,3,B00P9UVDDE,"Zero effort put into making these DVDs, compared with seasons 1-4. No extras. Episodes aren't even re-mastered. Don't even have chapters in the episodes. But if this is the only way to get this season...",1436227200,,203,4.828571428571428
6791288,5,B00P9UVDDE,"So happy this and the final season released!  Had to laugh when saw a parson's table I had just painted orange show up in Bob's office-- obviously, I am recreating Bob's mid century modern office, subconsciously.
But wow, that red leisure suit--his wardrobe was over the top!",1436054400,,275,4.851063829787234
6791289,5,B00P9UVDDE,"For those people who only know Bob Newhart from his guest appearances on Big Bang Theory, I would suggest they purchase this series from the 1970's and see the real Bob Newhart.  Excellent supporting cast (Suzanne Pleshette was always just perfect as were Bill Daley, Marcia Wallace and Peter Bonerz).  Mr. Gianelli, Mr. Carlin, Mrs. Bakerman and all the rest.  Just so funny and entertaining.  Bob Newhart is one of the greatest comedians of our time and we are all so blessed to have these shows on DVD to watch time and again.",1435795200,,529,4.655913978494624

6791295,3,B00P9UVDDE,The clarity of this volume is no where as sharp as the first four.  This was not produced by 20th Century Fox like the first four. This is probably why the dvd is not top quality.,1432684800,,179,3.9722222222222223
6791296,5,B00P9UVDDE,the shout factory is the best version out there bar none,1431734400,,56,4.181818181818182
6791297,4,B00P9UVDDE,"I agree with the reviewer MK.  The content of the DVD is just as you'd expect which is good!  I have found that the sound quality and picture quality lacked compared to the prior 4 seasons, though.  I thought it was my TV that was the issue but my TV is new and after reading other reviews, I see it's more of a general quality issue.  If I hadn't watched Seasons 1-4 over and over again waiting to get Season 5, I don't know that I would have noticed it as much but I do feel like there is a definitely quality difference between the prior four seasons and season 5.  The sound sounds a little more muffled and the picture is not quite as sharp from my perspective.

All that being said, I love this series - one of my favorites and glad that all the seasons are now individually available.",1431216000,,791,4.171052631578948
6791298,5,B00P9UVDDE,I was delighted to find these Newhart DVD's.  Since these episodes are rarely shown on tv it was like watching new shows!  The quality of the DVD's was excellant and they were clear and the audio was superb.,1430784000,,207,4.421052631578948

6791300,5,B00P9UVDDE,prompt delivery and as described,1429401600,,32,5.6
6791301,5,B00P9UVDDE,"I waited several years for Season 5 to come out on DVD; I had seen the episodes in syndication awhile back and they're funnier than I remember. The ensemble cast is great as always (Mr. Carlin and Jerry are hysterical!), but the star as always is the wonderfully wry Bob Newhart.

The season starts off strong with a few guest spots and winds down when the Hartleys have a baby; what was meant to be a series-ending plot was later written as a dream sequence.

Thank you to Shout! Factory for taking over the series. They did a good job with the packaging and the film and sound reproduction is very good for a 1970s transfer.",1429315200,,626,4.387931034482759

6791306,3,B00P9UVDDE,"Disappointed after waiting many years for the last 2 seasons of The Bob Newhart Show to be made available. Something definitely changed in the writing. Jerry's character is just downright mean. Not funny. Even Bob and Emily are snarky to one another, which seems out of character from the first 4 seasons. It's also obvious, all these years later, to see that just because other shows of the mid-1970s were using swear words and getting away with it, someone on the staff of this show decided to do the same thing. It seems out of character for the Bob and Emily that we grew to love in the first 4 seasons. And WHAT happened to Bob's sister, Ellen?? She was a semi-main character for the 3rd and 4th seasons, and now she's just gone, without any explanation. She was the perfect foil for Howard, and we miss her. Howard's character has his moments in this season, but even he isn't consistently lovable like he was. Definitely a disappointment from the first 4 seasons to the changes in this 5th season. (The 6th season isn't any better.)",1426809600,12,1039,4.591397849462366

6791315,4,B00P9UVDDE,"I've always been a fan of this show.  As with many series, there are some hilarious episodes, numerous good funny episodes, and a few I simply didn't like (e.g., I can't stand the ""Peeper"" guy).  The main reason I'm giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is the sound quality.  I know this drives some people crazy, and there will be comments like ""you're supposed to review the show, not the sound,"" but if I'm going to fork over good money for a DVD collection I want to know about the picture and sound quality before I order.  The picture is pretty good, maybe not quite as sharp and clear as with the first four series, but Shout Factory seems unable to produce consistent sound.  Several of the Season 5 episodes I've watched so far have distorted sound and it's hard to catch all the dialogue, or you have to turn the volume way up high and get a lot of background noise, or, in one case, the sync is off, so the words don't match the lips.  I suppose this is relatively minor, and I would've bought the set anyway just to have it, but I thought someone might like to know.  Otherwise, it's the Bob Newhart you know and love.  5 stars for the shows, 4 stars for sound, I'd rate it 4 and a half if I could.  P.S. The discs are all one-sided.",1424563200,23,1245,4.197478991596639
