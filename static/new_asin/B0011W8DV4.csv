This movie is about two young people who are in love, get married and their struggles as the reality of married life sets in. Wonderfully directed, though be warned it starts very slow, the chemistry between Rajesh and Sharmila is something to behold. It is hard to imagine these two are not a real life couple, so comfortable and in-sync they are with each other, whether in intimate scenes such as the bed scene during pregnancy, or planning to have a baby or the emotional confession when she confronts him with his infidelity. The slow progression from lover to spouse is so real, one can identify with their anguish and hurt and disappointments. I love this movie and would recommend it as a reality check for relationships.",1398124800,,960,4.554913294797688
