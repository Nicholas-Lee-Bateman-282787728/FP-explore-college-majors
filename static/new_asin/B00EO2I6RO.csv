5929522,4,B00EO2I6RO,"This has always been a favorite film of mine. How can you beat the first screen version of Dracula. Cleverly disguised as a typical (?!) Vampire movie. Two complaints however. More restoration of the image could have been done. Since It was on standard Def DVD once before, it looked great. But now on Blu-ray, and defects not noticeable before, are quite noticeable now. I wish the producers had secured the rights to the musical score written for the film by Hammer Films master James Bernard. Anyone who has heard that version, knows of what I speak. It's brilliant. Having that as another choice of scores, would have made this release, that much more special. Still highly recommended.",1394668800,5,690,4.8559322033898304

As much as I'm a lover of the Universal original movie, this film is light years ahead in mood, character, and plot. I also think the image of Max Shrek as Nosferatu is more horrifying than Bela's.

5929525,4,B00EO2I6RO,"This is a review of the Kino Classics Deluxe Restored Blu-Ray.

I already owned the Image DVD of Nosferatu when I upgraded to the Kino Blu-Ray.  Good choice.  The Image disc had a fine restoration hampered by a slightly fuzzy image, fluctuating contrast, a soporific organ score (still superior to the chintzy-sounding synth score), and some smaller quirks that I found irritating (the shades used for tinting were a bit too vivid, the frame rate was a little too fast, and some of the scene transitions and intertitles appearing ""digitized,"" for want of a better word).

This Blu-Ray is absolutely not a perfect presentation, but that has entirely to do with the degraded source materials, not the restoration or encoding.  Visual imperfections abound - stretched frames, fluctuating brightness, assorted scratches - but it's obvious that immense care went into minimizing these distractions without detracting from the film itself.  Overall, the picture is stunning, with fine details (set decor, facial expressions) and grand vistas (the mountain cinematography in the first act) given clarity that I've never encountered, with nicely balanced contrast and appropriate grain.  The frame rate is corrected to a modern-day standard; the intertitles are stylish and easily read; and the tinting has pleasant, organic tones (similar to the Murnau Foundations equally excellent Nibelungen restoration).  These factors count for a lot, since I'd say the ""old-fashioned"" appearance of silent movies (even more than the lack of sync-sound) is the greatest barrier to a present-day viewer.

Honestly, I would have bought a new copy of Nosferatu just for a more lively musical track, and the restoration of the original score is excellent, alternatingly grand and austere to compliment the action onscreen.  It's not a long movie, but I've never been able to tear through it the way I did with this edition.  The restoration truly enhances the viewing experience.

As for the movie itself, it's not my favorite silent movie (or my favorite vampire movie), but it's still captivating to watch, much more lively than its reputation suggests, and deserves the absolutely superb presentation it receives here.",1391731200,12,2198,5.320809248554913

5929527,3,B00EO2I6RO,"5 Stars for the movie itself,because it is a classic masterpiece. I cannot review the transfer and blu-ray extras because it would not play on my blu-ray player. This is a locked blu-ray and will only play in Region A players.",1388620800,,226,4.536585365853658
5929528,4,B00EO2I6RO,"If own other Kino editions of this film, you will be doubtlessly a bit disappointed. The 2 disc set contains 2 versions of the film: one with English intertitles and one with German intertitles, which are otherwise identical.  Also included are clips from other Murray silent films. Finally, the Language Of Shadows making-of documentary is included..

As mentioned by another review picture clarity and resolution are excellent. A good amount of print damage is present, but it didn't expect otherwise given consequences of the production (great prints were destroyed by court order, leaving only collector and archive prints for these transfers.

The original score is well executed and adds to the enjoyment. This set represents an HD upgrade of Kino's previous ultimate edition DVD.

An anomaly with my copy is that any movement has a strange jerky quality. I last this anomaly on my old Region 1 Milestone edition of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. In that case, it was blamed on a PAL to NTSC conversion. I don't that is the case here, though.",1387065600,2,1039,4.954022988505747

Some scenes will make you feel as though Nosferatu were recently filmed and simply digitally altered to look old.

5929532,4,B00EO2I6RO,"This 1922 classic ranks only slightly before The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as my favorite horror film of all time (the silents did it better, people!), so naturally I was eager to purchase the new Blu-ray version released by Kino Lorber, which has a terrific track record for bringing these silent gems to the public rather than treat them as outdated curiosities no modern audiences would find relevance in.

First off, while some misinformed members of the public would tell you that anything ""pre-HD"" does not benefit from Blu-ray's high-definition mastering process (""They didn't have HD in the 1920s!""), a short correction is necessary here: the 1990s and 2000s did not ""invent"" HD resolution. HD is simply a digital moniker telling one how many pixels are available in an image. The more pixels, the higher the resolution. When it comes to celluloid film, such as what Nosferatu and basically anything pre-2000s was shot on, once that film is scanned into a digital format via a machine, the amount of resolution in those frames of celluloid provide more digital pixels than our current HDTVs can even show you. In short, HD is a digital term and all FILM, when scanned to digital, exceeds HD requirements in terms of pixels.

So now that we have put to rest the idea that films like Nosferatu do not benefit from HD, let us delve into the actual Blu-ray.

Kino is notorious for doing very little cleanup on their silent film titles, as too much scrubbing to remove excessive scratches and dirt from the frames can smudge detail and lead to an inconsistent grain structure. Contrary to what you have have heard, grain on film is a good thing--it is the equivalent of a digital pixel. It makes up the detail in the image. Remove too much, and you end up with a low-resolution, waxy picture devoid of sharp detail and fine lines. This is not to say that Kino has released Nosferatu with blemishes and smudges that make the film unwatchable. It means they have cleaned the picture up just enough to allow you to see the increased detail HD provides without overly distracting elements like film splices and hairs getting in the way of your enjoyment.

The release will also be a shock to many who have been accustomed to seeing films like Nosferatu in stark black-and-white, as Kino's release (and previous DVD) is color tinted. This means some daytime shots are bathed in yellow and the nighttime photography is often blue. Don't mistake these alterations for useless revisionism--the original prints of the film, like many other silent films of the era, were tinted since color film, which did exist but was highly costly to utilize, was not the norm in the 1920s. In the case of this Blu-ray, the tints have been historically re-created to be true to the way Nosferatu would have looked in 1922.

In terms of soundtrack, we only get one score, with the option to listen to it in 5.1 surround sound or a more pared-down 2.0 version.

There has been some contention among fans that Kino created quite a blunder with this release by accidentally removing frames and chopping off an estimated 11% of the film. This stems from the fact that silent films were often projected at speeds of 18 frames per second as opposed to the modern 24 frames per second. To compensate, different algorithms are used to display these frames at the proper speed on modern television sets. Some fans have discovered that Kino inadvertently used an inferior process that results in frame jumps at intermittent points in the presentation, leading to a loss of a small portion of a scene that collectively add up to a loss of 11% of the frames over the course of the running time. They cite the UK's BFI Blu-ray as being free of this issue.

While I have only seen Nosferatu in black-and-white versions previously and have no way of viewing the non-region free UK release for comparison, I will say this: while there are occasional frame jumps such as a character seeming to magically skip forward a few steps when walking, for instance, these issues are not overly detrimental to the experience and are not quite as disastrous as they are made out to be. Kino, for their part, has not openly acknowledged an issue, despite being made aware of the problem, and many online reviewers whose job it is to review Blu-rays do not mention this being a problem or a concern. I scoured online reviews for this particular release for hours and could not come up with a single one that spoke negatively of the release in relation to this alleged framing issue. My conclusion is they were either completely ignorant of the problem (which lends credence to the fact it cannot be that noticeable offhand if none of them caught it), or they were aware of it but felt it was of negligible concern. If the issue were so horrible, surely one of them would have made note of it?

As for the image quality itself, the disc is gorgeous. The viewer is presented with two viewing options: a version with English inter-titles and the original German version with German inter-titles and English subtitles. I would recommend going for the latter, as it is the most authentic and also contains a bit more picture information at the top and bottom of the frame than the English version (and some say the resolution on this version is better, too).

With a beautiful 1080p picture and wonderful color tinting, this 1922 classic looks stunning in HD and Kino has done a commendable job breathing new life into this horror gem. For fans of the film or silent film lovers in general, this is a must-buy.",1477094400,38,5551,4.714432989690722

5929535,5,B00EO2I6RO,"The only production of Prana Film, this is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Because the studio was unable to purchase the rights to the source material, they made a series of alterations, though not enough to avoid a lawsuit from Stoker's widow. Fortunately, some copies survived the court-ordered destruction of the film, and so it is we have a marvelous production of a legendary horror story.

The tumultuous legal history aside, the film itself is nothing short of magnificent. The pacing of the film is very good, the story split into a series of acts, and things move along steadily so that you never feel as if the film is milling about unnecessarily (part of its troubled production was its limited budget and shooting times, and you can compare the shadows in same-location scenes to tell the passing of mere hours). It's said that Murnau used a metronome to pace each scene's acting.

One thing I enjoy seeing in silent-era films is what proves wrong the label of ""black-and-white"" films: that scenes are colored in different ways to match the mood or the time of day, such as night scenes being in black-and-blue or black-and-purple. While many black-and-white films have a good quality to them that can hold even in modern-made films such as The Artist, seeing these older pictures with more tonal coloring just adds a welcome touch that I really wish someone would try again. It really does make a difference.

Another element is the lighting, or rather, the shadowing (Murnau famously called film-making the ""language of shadows,"" as he felt shadows were more important than lighting). Seeing Court Orlok's shadow on the wall, or reaching upon someone's heart, is a chilling image and a brilliant storytelling technique, with a strong symbolism to it.

Orlok himself, played by Max Schreck, is a very well-done character. His bald and subtly-misshapen head, his elongated ears, his bulging eyes and gaunt cheeks, his pointed nose, and his clawed hands present a thoroughly-unsettling form, and it's made all the more frightening by his fangs (laughable by modern standards, since they're basically his two front teeth rather than sharpened incisors). In the making-of, it's revealed that his makeup and overall costuming caused many locals to shun him and treat him like the Devil himself.

The other characters are certainly well-done, with the crooked real estate broker, Knock, being a very comical imitation of Renfield, much to my satisfaction. The protagonist, Hutter (a mirror to Johnathan Harker), definitely gets points for being fairly courageous, in both his attempt to confront Orlok and his escape from the castle. The substitute for Van Helsing, Professor Bulwer, is a good figure as well, though I imagine many viewers might feel let down by his lack of action in comparison to any number of other Dracula adaptations; it should be noted that Dr. Seward's mirror shares comparable screen time and accomplishment.

A special note for Ellen, Hutter's wife. Her likeness in a memento that Orlok sees causes on the film's most hilarious lines (admittedly the intent is to be alarmed by the Count's attention), and her emotional connection to Hutter causes her to display some nerve-wracking acts, causing other characters to believe her struck by unknown maladies. The ending scene with her, built up to by her reading of a very particular book, is especially stirring.

I was going to ask for this for my birthday, but ended up refraining and instead using a birthday gift card to purchase it (which amounts to more or less the same thing, I suppose). I'm very glad I did get around to not only seeing but owning this, because I'd really like to watch it again one day and finish watching the extras, and perhaps even take the time to view the version on the second disc, which is the version with German intertitles.

Very highly recommend.",1474070400,7,3874,4.976816074188562

5929538,1,B00EO2I6RO,"Usually Kino do a pretty good to great job on their silent film releases. Not this time. The following comments are lifted from Brenton Film's website (for more see: [...]). I post them here to help anyone considering buying this edition.

""Sadly Kino didn't stop there: they actually mucked up both transfers; Im going to have to get a little bit technical here but bear with me. Sound film and 1080p Blu-rays run at 24 frames per second (fps) and most silent films run between 1622fps. Nosferatus optimum frame rate is 18fps, so to slow it down Eureka simply repeated/doubled every third frame, giving a pattern or pulldown like this: 112 112 112. Easy, right? In motion, this formula is undetectable to most people. Now, for reasons known only to themselves, Kino often transfer their silent films to disc using some highly illogical methods. In the case of Nosferatu the pulldown is 12121230 12121230. So you see, they repeat every other frame twice, then the seventh frame three times. Huh? As if that wasn't enough, to make the resulting mess still fit into 24fps, theyve then eliminated every eighth frame. This results in the complete loss of over 11% of Nosferatus frames. The final outcome is that visible motion jitter, a juddery, stutter-like effect, is introduced throughout and a goodly chunk of the actual film is gone. The restorers job wholly undone. All in all, an absolutely pathetic effort and a total rip-off.

Many people, unaware of this issue, will just see a picture that on the whole has more resolution than a DVD and, lacking a superior comparison, just accept the jerkiness as being part of the silent film experience. NO! Such thinking is akin to the dark decades following the silent era, when they were rubbished as being uniformly amateurish, sped up, scratched, choppy cinematic daubings. That was before these more enlightened times of restoration and proper presentation. Id advise you to avoid the Kino travesty altogether and, if you already have it, stick to their earlier 2007 DVD. Do note that too, like all Kino DVDs made from European masters, has its own set of problems. Also beware Kinos 2013 DVD: its culled from the same master as its HD counterpart and is equally disastrous. Im a strong advocate of always choosing the best quality, authorised and/or restored releases but sometimes  thankfully very rarely  even they can be screwed up. Kinos Nosferatu gets my vote for the worst official silent film Blu-ray and DVD to date. Again, your best option is to go region free and import one of the Euro BDs. If you have region free DVD playback, at least get Eurekas superior 2013 2-DVD set, their third. Its region B coded but unlike both their earlier ones is in the NTSC format, so fully playable in the US and Canada.""

5929550,5,B00EO2I6RO,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old classic black & white horror movie.

I originally HAD to watch this for an art class (mumble mumble 45 years ago) in college.  Luckily, I decided to give it another try as with old age, I have learned to love a lot of things I hated when I was young (bluegrass music being one of them)  There are many things that place this film in your ""see before you die"" category. It's a priceless, fantastic piece of work, from start to finish, and it has beautiful staying power, even now. But there are a few things that work against it. The music to the film lends neither good, nor bad to it. Understandably, this is very early film, and perception of people watching the film in the twenties was probably vastly different, but seeing as this could be considered one of the earliest horror movies, the music from this film could very much have been better used in a silent drama, or comedy.

On that note, Max Schreck is perfect. Much has been said about his ability to capture the character so perfectly (as in Shadow of the Vampire), and it's true. Though it's in no way comparable to Bela Lugosi as a character, this movie is still a very important piece in cinema, and I'm honored to be able to say that I've had the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a brilliant work of early cinema.

In the opening scenes, ""Nosferatu"" establishes itself through a series of ominous images: an obscured sunset, a silenced crowd at a Carpathian inn, and two of the most dreadfully frightening characters I've ever witnessed in a film. Max Schreck and Alexander Granach play Count Orlock and Mackler Knock respectively, and both deliver performances that, even though they are silent, evoke as much fear and mystery as Hannibal Lecter.

What is so impressive about this film is that it is able to inspire fear without modern horror film conventions. No objects suddenly revealing themselves alongside a bold musical note, no horror villain stereotypes. This movie inspires fear through the manipulation of its characters; their movements, their costume and in the case of Count Orlock, their slow, foreboding walk. The most frightening point in this film is when the wide eyes of Max Schreck are first seen. This is not the kind of horror that warrants a scream, but rather leaves you completely silent and in awe of its genius

Too bad no one since Murnau has ever gotten it right: Vampires are EVIL! Not romantic idols! They are a curse on the human race and need to be eradicated, not admired, sympathized with, or envied! Max Schreck himself will ever be a mystery that defies resolution. What more could you ask? Well, maybe the benefit of all the technology that has enhanced films since 1922! But there seems to be no director or screenwriter who understands the real nature of the vampire myth They all pander to the notion that vampires are the subjects of sexual attraction and romantic fantasy.

SPOILER ALERT
The story is narrated from the diary of Johann Cavallius, historian of the city of Bremen, who is wondering if it was the Nosferatu who brought the plague to Bremen in 1838.

Newlyweds Hutter [Gustav von Wangenheim] and Ellen [Greta Schroeder] are saddened when Hutter is sent to Transylvania by Hutter's employer Knock [Alexander Grannach] to arrange for Count Orlok's [Max Schreck] purchase of a house across the street from the Hutters' house in Bremen. Hutter travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count, is bitten by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle but not before seeing the Count depart on a cart loaded with coffins. While Hutter recuperates in a hospital after succeeding in his escape, the Count moves into the house across from the Hutters'. The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. The ""Book of the Vampires"" tells Ellen what she must do to end the vampire.

The Count meets his doom when Ellen manages to keep him until after cock crow. Best scene is the vampire rising from Ellen's neck after realizing the cock has crowed. As the sun slowly advances on the houses across the street (visible from the window), the Nosferatu attempts to escape. In doing so, he passes the window and is trapped by the sunlight. He 'vaporizes' into a puff of fire on the carpet. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]

1922 Version The film presents itself as a chronicle of the Great Death of Wisborg. It begins with a man named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) picking flowers for his wife Ellen (Greta Schroeder) She remarks why have you killed them the beautiful flowers? Hutter hugs his wife, laughing at her reaction. He soon leaves for work, when a passerby tells him Do not hurry, my young friend! Nobody can escape destiny. An inter-title card reveals that Hutters employer is man named Knock (Alexander Granach). He has many rumors surrounding him, the only thing known for certain is that he pays well. Knock is reading in his office a letter covered in strange writing. He calls Hutter into his office and informs him that Count Orlok (Max Schreck) of Transylvania is looking to purchase a house in their small town. He tells Hutter he could make a lot of money though it might require a bit of effort perhaps a bit of blood. Hutter examines a map of Europe while he considers the proposition and Knock takes another look at the letter from the Count. After a moment a thought occurs to Knock, he suggests Hutter sell Orlok the nice deserted house opposite Hutters own home. Knock tells him to travel quickly to the country of ghosts. Both men laugh as the scene fades to black.

Hutter rushes home to inform his wife of the exciting news. Ellen is disappointed her husband is leaving, but he is anxious to begin his journey. He packs a few belongings, leaving his wife with friends of the family, a rich shipowner named Harding (Georg H. Schnell) and his sister (Ruth Landshoff). Hutter kisses his wife to reassure her, then leaves for Transylvania. A title card tells us that Hutter travels many dusty roads to the Karpathen mountains. He arrives at a tavern, still excited by his trip. He yells out for dinner before he continues on to Count Orloks castle. Upon hearing this, the crowd in the tavern react with shock and fear. They tell him he cant continue due to the werewolf stalking the forests at night. A wolf like creature scares many horses into bolting into the wilderness, so Hutter stays the night at the inn. After being led to his room, Hutter closes the window and gets ready for bed when he notices a book on his nightstand. It is titled Of Vampires, Terrible Ghosts, Magic, and The Seven Deadly Sins. He reads a section on Nosferatu, terrible creatures that live in caves filled with soil from the fields of Black Death. Thinking nothing of it, Hutter goes to sleep. The next morning Hutter wakes as shepherds are returning horses to their corrals. He again notices the book, but still thinks nothing of it and soon continues his journey.

After traveling all day by carriage Hutter is yelling to the driver to hurry before the sun sets. The driver pulls over, telling Hutter he refuses to go any further, no matter Hutter offers to pay him. Undisturbed by the drivers cowardice, Hutter takes his gear and continues on foot. He crosses a small wooden bridge and comes to a deserted road. A moment later a carriage arrives with a sinister looking driver. The driver says nothing, but motions for Hutter to get in. After a cautious moment, Hutter gets in, and the carriage goes back the way it came. They soon arrive at a ruined castle, and the driver motions for Hutter to go inside. Hutter walks toward the castle when the door appears to open by itself. With a bit of apprehension, Hutter enters the castle. He is met by the same sinister figure, now revealed to be Count Orlok. Orlok informs him that he has waited too long, and all the servants have already gone to bed, so he leads Hutter inside himself.

A moment later the two men are sitting at a table. Hutter is eating as Orlok studies papers concerning his new real estate. Hutter is watching Orlok so intently that he accidentally cuts his thumb while slicing bread, drawing blood. Orlok reacts immediately, saying the precious blood. Hutter begins to back away in fear, when Orlok proposes the two spend some time together talking, as it is several hours until dawn and Orlok must sleep during the day. Hutter awakens the next morning to find the castle empty but a meal waiting for him. He takes a mirror out of his pocket and examines his neck where he can see two small marks. After breakfast he examines the castle grounds, stopping to write a letter to his wife Ellen. He tells her not to be mad that her love is away, and attributes the marks on his neck to mosquitoes. He flags down a passerby to deliver his letter.

That night Hutter is again sitting with Count Orlok. The Count is going over paperwork when he notices portrait of Hutters wife, which instantly catches his attention. He holds the picture remarking she has such a beautiful neck. He then informs Hutter that he will buy the beautiful deserted house opposite his own. Later Hutter is in his room where he is reading more from his book. He reads an article concerning how the Nosferatu hunt and a warning not let their shadow burden your sleep. His bedroom door opens by itself to reveal Orlok who menacingly enters the room. As he does so Ellen begins sleepwalking back in their hometown. She wanders out onto her balcony where she almost falls off. When Orlok finally leaves Hutter, the door again moving on its own behind him, Ellen falls back to sleep.

The next morning Hutter decides to investigate the horrors of the castle. He finds a coffin in the basement, and further investigation reveals Orlok sleeping inside. Hutter leaves the basement in a state of horror. That night he looks out his window to see Orlok loading a wagon with several coffins. After stacking the coffins he climbs into the last one, lid lifting onto the coffin by itself before the carriage drives itself away. Hutter, worried about his wife, ties several sheets together in an effort to escape out his window. He falls from his makeshift rope before reaching the bottom, and is knocked unconscious. Orlok continues his journey down the river via raft, the raftsmen unaware of their cargo. Hutter is found by a farmer and is brought to a hospital, where he is slowly recovering. Orlok's coffins arrive at a seaport where they are being loaded onto a ship. The sailors are curious as the contents of the boxes, so the tip over to find nothing but soil and rats.

Professor Bulwer (John Gottowt) is presenting a lecture to his class about unusual predators in nature. He shows his class meat-eating plants, remarking how similar they are to vampires. Back in Wisborg, Knock has been admitted to an insane asylum. He attacks his doctor, yelling blood is life! After being subdued, Knock becomes fascinated by the spiders in his cell.

Ellen passes the time waiting for her husband sitting on the beach. One day, Harding and his sister bring her the letter Hutter wrote while at the castle. Ellen still longs for her husband, who has recovered enough that he decides to head home. He is still visibly weak, but he cant wait any longer. As he leaves for home Orlok is traveling towards Wisborg via ship. Back in the asylum, Knock steals a newspaper from one of the guards where he reads an article about plague victims in the ports along the Black Sea. All the plague victims have strange marks on their neck, and Knock realizes his master is coming. On the ship sailors are falling ill. The first mate and the captain come to check on their sickened crew, where the ghostly image of Orlok is watching him. Soon only the first mate and captain remain alive. As they heave another body overboard, the first mate decides to finish things once and for all, and takes a hatchet into the cargo hold. He begins to break up the boxes of soil, but as he does the lid lifts off a coffin and Orlok arises. Stricken with fear, the first mate drops his hatchet, runs to the top deck and throws himself overboard. The captain lashes himself to the wheel, but he is soon attacked and killed by Orlok. A title card exclaims the death ship has a new captain.

Hutter travels night and day to get home as quickly as possible. In Wisborg, Ellen is again sleepwalking, now speaking in her sleep, seemingly in anticipation of Orloks arrival. She says, I have to go to him he is coming! Knock also seems to sense the arrival of the ship, becoming anxious as Orlok gets closer. The ship docks itself and the door to the cargo hold opens. Orlok immerges, carrying one of his coffins. As Orlok makes his way through town with his coffin, Hutter arrives home where he and his wife greet each other enthusiastically.

Back at the dock Harding is investigating the ship, finding the dead captain and a log of the journey. He reads about how illness gradually killed the eight crewman. The captain wrote of a rat infestation and the possibility of a plague threat. Upon reading this, Harding tells everyone to return to their homes and keep their windows and doors closed. Later the town crier announces that plague victims must stay within their homes. White crosses mark the doors of plague victims as coffins are being carried out of several houses.

Hutter tells his wife not to read the horrible book he has brought back with him, but some force compels her to read. He tries to comfort her, but they both sense the presence of Orlok watching them from his new home. Hardings sister falls ill, and Ellen watches as a funeral procession is lead by her house. This leads her to read from the book, where she reads that the only way to defeat the Nosferatu is if a sinless maiden gives her blood to it willingly, making it forget about the coming dawn until it is too late.

Meanwhile, the fear stricken town is searching for a scapegoat to blame for the plague, and they blame the recently escaped Knock. They chase him throughout the city, but he eludes them, mocking the townspeople from rooftops before running into the woods.

Ellen is working on needlepoint, writing Ich Liebe Dich, a German phrase meaning I Love You. That night she can sense Orlok watching her from his building. She opens the window, in a sense inviting him to her. She pretends to fall ill, telling Hutter to go get Bulwer, leaving her alone to face Orlok. Hutter rushes off, leaving Ellen alone in bed. She cowers in bed as the shadow of Orlok creeps ever closer to her, soon enveloping her completely. As Orlok sucks her blood he suddenly hears a rooster crow, and realizes that he has mistakenly stayed out until dawn. He rushes to leave, but as he crosses in front of the window he walks into the beams of the rising sun. He is instantly burned, vanishing in a puff of smoke. Knock, who has finally be captured and returned to the asylum, senses that his master is dead. Ellen is found by Hutter the next morning, the two embracing as the horror is finally over.",1443398400,,15083,4.626073963391857

5929552,5,B00EO2I6RO,"This is an impressive masterpiece of cinema and possibly the best vampire movie ever. Albeit very old, it is still not aged - and I think it never will. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

""Nosferatu"" is the first cinema adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", but as the producers were unable to acquire the rights to the title, it was decided to change the name of the main character to Graf (or Count) Orlok. Similarly the word ""vampire"" was replaced with ""nosferatu"", a term used in Romanian folk tales to design many kind of sinister forces of the night, which Bram Stoker considered in his book as a synonym of ""vampire"". Some other changes were also introduced, but the main story nevertheless follows the lines of Bram Stoker's book - with the exception of the ending...

The film begins therefore with a certain Thomas Hutter, who lives in the fictitious German city of Wisborg and is a quite happy fellow, married to beautiful Ellen. Then one day his employer, a somehow shady real estate dealer named Knock, sends Hutter to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok, who desires to acquire a residence in Wisborg. And then the film REALLY begins...

This being a black and white silent movie, it is of course very different from most of other vampire films - but this is precisely what gives it an unique flavour. F.W. Murnau used all the tricks available in his trade at this time to make this film really scary and especially incredibly atmospheric and he succeeded - BIG TIME! The vampire is in no way a dangerously charming aristocrat as in later films with Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee - here he is a freakishly creepishly grotesque creature, which makes the viewer feel uncomfortable from the first moment we see him. Actor Max Schreck who plays the vampire (and who by the way was a handsome man) was completely transformed by make up and other characterisation but he especially did an incredible job by using the body language in such a way that we really have an impression that Count Orlok is NOT human! This is an incredible performance!

The performance of actors, the atmospheric music, the tricks of lights and shadows and impressive cinematography, all this contributed to make this film into something exceptionnal. Released in 1922 ""Nosferatu"" is a very old, even ancient thing, but it didn't really age and probably never will anymore, but to the contrary, it will keep haunting generation after generation of humans - exactly like a vampire...)))

I am very glad that I bought and watched it and I intend to keep this DVD as long as DVD players exist. I don't have words strong enough to recommend it so I will just say, BUY IT, SEE IT and KEEP IT!",1441843200,2,2716,4.7094736842105265
5929553,5,B00EO2I6RO,"Nosferatu, is a very interesting old film.  This is another German horror film  like the Golem and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  It was released in 1922 and basically stole it source material from Bram Stoker's Dracula.  The director F.W. Murnau just changed the names of the Characters in the film, but it is basically the same story. Max Shreck's Count Orloc is much more creepy than Bela Lugosi Dracula.  The long gaunt face, the elf ears, the long fingers, the long vampire teeth are his two center teeth like extra long buck teeth give Orloc that extra creepy look.  The is one of a dangerous monster who kills many people and his weakness is discovered by the Heroine.  This where the movie differs from the book in how the vampire is defeated.  There is that Gothic feel to the film, that help build that sense of dread and strangeness that helped set the pattern for all vampire films that would follow. Unlike other vampire films, people who die from his bite do not turn in to vampires.  There is a scene where we see a long procession of men carrying coffins through the middle of the street. The deaths are attributed to  the plague.  Ellen sees the long procession and figures out the real reason for all the dead being paraded  through the streets. She has found the small book on vampires that her husband found in Orloc's castle., after his belongings were sent home.  This movie is well worth owning and watching.  This is one of the three German films that helped set the standard for all the Horror films that followed.  Most people don't like the old black and white silent films and yet they are important films that not only set the tone for the Horror films that followed, they also developed styles and techniques that were copied in all types of film genres to follow.  A great film.",1439683200,,1808,4.5510835913312695
5929554,5,B00EO2I6RO,"A mid-silent era masterpiece by F.W. Murnau, Nosferatu almost became a ""lost"" film. Its production company, Prana, was sued by Bram Stoker's estate. The court ordered all its negatives and prints destroyed and Prana declared bankruptcy to get out from under the damage award. Nosferatu was the only film Prana produced. Seems a copy or two got buried in collections or archives, to be exhumed decades later bringing it back to life, ironically fitting for a vampire movie. A number of characteristics of vampires, as depicted in the movies (but not necessarily in the book), were established in Nosferatu, most notably the deadly allergy to direct sunlight.

The grandfather of horror films, Nosferatu terrified its audiences. Banned in Sweden 1922-1972 for being too horrifying. The latter date is more related to its exhumation, resurrection and re-release than any great enlightenment taking fifty years. The movie serves today as a superb study in the use of cinematography framing and lighting with use of light and shadow, as well as post-production tinting and some other techniques, to help tell the story and express emotion in the silent era. The modest over-acting is what one normally expects in the silent era, but it's not as high an over the top melodrama as seen in other silents. This was not a high budget film and the special effects are nearly non-existent beyond makeup and Nosferatu's prosthetics. However, there was considerable thought put into every aspect that was filmed for the mood it created, particularly with use of light and shadow, and its contribution to the story telling. Murnau used the equivalent of story boards and the script contains considerable notes regarding locations used and production design, on location and at the Berlin Prana studios sets. Pacing is good and consistent for the silent era and intertitles. The story has a very logical sequence and doesn't bog down anywhere. Likewise, the character development is decent for the principals; while there is some for the major supporting roles, it's noticeably less, likely for efficiency and maintaining the pacing.

Finally, the movie must be put into the context of Berlin in its early interbellum years. The war ended in 1918 with Germany's monarchy collapsing creating a political vacuum. German lands held since the 1870's and earlier were ceded by the 1919 Versailles Treaty to other countries, along with submitting to massive war reparation payments. Germany was in continuous political turmoil within the Weimar Republic, including rampant economic inflation induced by the crippling war reparations and restrictions on its heavy industry. Within a country trying to find a new identity and recover from a war, Berlin became a freewheeling ""anything goes"" social hotbed. It was in that environment the German film industry rose in prominence and the German Expressionist films were created. German Expressionist cinema production emigrated to the UK and US during the early 1930's with the rise of the Nazi party, its rabid antisemitism, and rigid absolute state control of all cinema production. The result was heavy influence on US and UK horror films, film noir, suspense and other crime films through the 1940's. Nosferatu is one of several silent era films that show the basis and origin of this influence. In particular, compare Nosferatu with Universal's 1931 Dracula.

Nosferatu may have lost its ability to terrify contemporary audiences, but it hasn't lost its ability to entertain them and illuminate the basis from which the horror genre's basic principles originated and grew. Count Orlok is as repulsive an evil villain today as he was over 90 years ago.

Blu-ray contains two discs, one with English intertitles and the other with German intertitles and English sub-titles. Blu-ray transfer is quite good given the condition of the source material, and includes some restoration work including missing intertitles. The sharpness and detail (within the limitations of the film source) is undoubtedly an improvement over the DVD. Recording of the original musical score is excellent. There are some extras that give a very good background about F.W. Murnau, Prana studios, the film's production, and Murnau's associates.",1434672000,8,4244,5.273668639053255

8607250,5,B00EO2I6RO,"While I do not know a lot of things about B&W silent films from the early 20th Century and I'm not a movie fan myself in general, I caught myself to do a research on this one because I wanted to learn about film-making and horror genre around last October. When I researched this, I was surprised by all of the praises and influential of this movie since it was made. The reason why I wanted to watch this just to see how it's well-made back then so let me give you my thought on this old movie.

PLOT:
A gothic, horror film that tells a story about a vampire named Count Orlok to explore the German city of Wisbog to make a plague. As for the story, it's well unique and aged. It isn't hard to watch if you aren't a modern movie-goer where today's audiences  only cares about today's technology. If this is hard for to watch all the way through, then do something else for your interest and that doesn't make you a good movie audience when it comes to 20th Century movies. Isn't that quite simple?

ACTING:
Acting it exactly how it needs to be. Modern audiences would probably say they're overacting and that's false. This movie was made in different era. The acting was on point. Max Schreck's, an actor who played the vampiric character, acting's the biggest thing this was ever done and that's how it carried the story. If Academy Awards was existed at the time, then this Best Male Acting in Leading Role would go to Max Schreck, in my opinion.

DIRECTION:
Simple to say about this. The director, F.W. Murnau, did an excellent job on this one. The movie made a perfect direction on the characters, places and story the way this movie needed to be. Sure, it took time and work but it nailed to the point on how this movie carried the story.

EDITING:
Different era. Editing, however, is not an easy job to do. This job does take a lot of patient and editor have to make sure a person edits scene-to-scene after each direction. Modern audience may say this job might be made from the computing or whatever but that's not true, this was made by the order of the director with the camera and his crew done this scene after scene, that's how it worked. There was no computer at that era, just filmed the movie with the camera on your own. Simple.

MUSIC:
The soundtrack is fantastic and dramatic. However, the version of this soundtrack may be different because this is a Blu-ray version, so this movie has different versions of music when it's on VHS, DVD or Blu-ray. Maybe I can say who knows?

Now this is a movie that really paved the way for horror since. About my opinion on this movie, why would I give the film a praise? The movie is an absolute masterpiece. Considering the year the movie was made, using everything to the power it could. The acting, cinematography, musical score, directing, editing, atmosphere, makeup design and costumes are all top-notch for this movie. Everything about this movie is mysterious and phenomenal, the way Max Schreck walks and his hand gestures. There are things to say about this movie is just mysterious, no matter how amazing this movie was made back then. It's 1922 and this movie shown the true power of film-making that changed cinema forever. I haven't watched ""Metropolis"" or ""The Artist"" yet, so I'll keep in mind about silent movies that has good film-making. As I say again, this movie is a finest masterpiece and I will now consider it as one of my 5 greatest films ever made and all-time. If you love movies and want to learn about film-making in general, then this movie is a must-see! Highly recommend!",1488067200,3,3562,4.513178294573644
