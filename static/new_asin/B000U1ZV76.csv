2913702,4,B000U1ZV76,"WARNER's THRILLERS: 4 FILM FAVORITES offers two above average movies (""Copycat"" and ""Pacific Heights"") along with a couple of flawed yet still interesting exercises in suspense. And at four-for-the-price-of-one, it's a solid deal. Transfer quality is first rate.

SYNOPSES--

COPYCAT--  Criminal psychologist is being stalked by a killer who emulates famous murderers of the past. The emotionally housebound doctor makes a target that two detectives find increasingly harder to protect. Superbly executed film includes Harry Connick Jr. in his best character role, that of a deranged and imprisoned serial killer.

THE CRUSH--  A young teanaged girl's unrequited love for the journalist living in her family's guest house leads to extreme violence.  Screenwriter/director Nick Shapiro based his story on events from his own life.

DIABOLIQUE--  A schoolmaster's wife and mistress collaborate to murder him and dump his remains. The body disappears from its resting place and the two women start to unravel when a retired detective begins investigating the teacher's disappearance. Excellent cast is somewhat wasted due to mediocre direction, scripting and cinematography.

PACIFIC HEIGHTS--  Young couple's plans to renovate a San Francisco house are ruined by the ""tenant from hell."" Michael Keaton is deliciously sinister. Watch for the star of Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" Tippi Hedren, in a minor role. Like Hitch, this film's director, John Schlesinger, makes a cameo appearance (as a man in the elevator).

2913908,5,B000U1ZV76,"I mainly bought this because of ""The Crush"" and ""Pacific Heights"".  In saying that, I guess I enjoy watching peoples lives get destroyed.  One man's life is brought into chaos due to a 14 or so year old girl that has a crush on him.  Pacific Heights stars 3 great actors that worked wonderfully in this movie.  It is unbelievable what things a person will due to wreck havoc on peoples lives and gain things for himself!",1404432000,2,420,4.415584415584416

2913942,5,B000U1ZV76,"You can`t go wrong with these 4 movies. They each are awesome in their own right. Sigourney Weaver rocks in Copycat, Alicia Silverstone is at her best in The Crush, Sharon Stone and Kathy Bates are great in Diabolique, And  an all star cast including a creepy Michael Keaton in Pacific Heights. If your a Thriller movie fan, You will love all 4 of these films!",1389052800,,360,4.454545454545454

2913945,4,B000U1ZV76,I loved the movies that are in this order I've seen them before but wanted to see them again pleased with my order,1377043200,,114,4.0
2913946,5,B000U1ZV76,These are full production A-Movies in a 4 pack at an incredible value. Love that I can get 4 movies in the space of 1 movie. Not to mention these are classic movies with compelling plots and great production value.,1376179200,,214,4.375
2913947,5,B000U1ZV76,I enjoy watching thrillers and these were good for the price.  My brother told me about Pacific Heights because he was renting out his condo.  Hopefully no one has to go though this.  Watch and see if you haven't seen it already.,1374796800,3,229,4.404761904761905
2913948,5,B000U1ZV76,"I love every movie in this DVD. Copycat is fabulous. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. It is one of the best movies ever. The other movies were as exciting and Pacific Heights is a must see movie. The Crush is one of my favorites of all time. I watch this DVD over and over, it's just that good. I will never get tired of Copycat and Pacific Heights. The ""roach scene"" is worth the price of a movie ticket.",1373760000,,424,3.941860465116279
2913949,5,B000U1ZV76,"Some people might prefer this to be offered in Blu Ray,  I never see much of a difference - unless I see someone who has heavily invested in the latest theatre experience.  That's not for me.  I LOVE 3 out of the 4 movies.  Diabolique is weird and I didn't care for it.  The other 3 are great!  They come in 2 separate DVD's and so worth the value - plus takes up less space.  l love this idea!!",1371686400,,395,3.9240506329113924
2913950,4,B000U1ZV76,"4 movies all with brutal motives.  Although, ""The Crush"" and ""Copycat"" are my favorites.  Glad someone had the mind to combine them.  A young Alicia Silverstone on a mission to claim what isn't hers in ""The Crush"" is a trip to watch.  Harry Connick Jr. menancing face and voice is enough to make you want be thankful that you don't see it or hear it very much through it this film.  He's utterly creepy in ""Copycat"".  ""Pacific Heights"", I found very interesting and also very nerve-racking. Michael Keaton makes you want to leap through the screen.  A bevy of action and attitude.  These films are not for the tame of heart.",1371600000,7,624,4.558558558558558
2914000,4,B000U1ZV76,these were a fun batch of movies to watch with a date and a bag of popcorn.  Great fun.  Will watch again.,1359417600,,106,3.772727272727273
2914001,4,B000U1ZV76,"I like the idea of getting more than one movie favorite in one set.
This has all my favorites in one.",1358726400,,101,3.857142857142857
2914002,5,B000U1ZV76,"Well worth buying. All the movies are good, and it takes up less apace having 4 on one disc. The price is well worth it even if you only like one of the movies.",1353715200,,160,3.735294117647059
2914003,5,B000U1ZV76,Not one bad movie in the bunch. Definitely a great bargin for four movies! These will be classic for years to come.,1351987200,,115,4.2727272727272725
2914004,4,B000U1ZV76,"All four movies are good films. The discs are double-sided, and it is difficult to read the movie titles on the disk. Not all of the movies are in widescreen format. For the price, however, it is a fantastic deal",1347321600,4,212,4.325
2914005,5,B000U1ZV76,"Four must see movies!

My favourite - Copy Cat.  Serial killer repeating past murders of very infamous killers.  A wonderful psychologist that ends up playing cat and mouse with him.  In the end she proves that mice can raw!  Very cool picture.

Diabolique - Twists with in twists.  Two woman wife and mistress kill the husband.  But the plot was to get the wife so stressed with the crime she would kill herself and the husband, not really dead would come back for his mistress.  BUT the plot does not go so simply.  A must see!

Pacific Heights-  A couple buy a house thats big enough to have tenants as well.  The tenant from hell moves in.  They come close to loosing everything because of his arghhhness.  A must see and you will never consider rental property a safe investment ever again.

The Crush.- A very tricky story about a genius 14 year old who gets a crush on her parents tenant in their guest house they rent out.  A very up front honest bloke is driven crazy and beyond by her manipulations but in the end spirits of people are what they are and get the karma they deserve.

All four are very good, I bought this for the Sigourney movie who is just so good.  But ended up thinking the whole deal is so good!  A must see and careful who you lend it too cause youll want to see it again and again.,...",1346803200,4,1317,4.276422764227642
2914006,5,B000U1ZV76,Choosing these four films was an excellent choice. All of them were favorites and of course warranted another batch of popcorn. We really did enjoy them.,1336003200,,153,4.923076923076923
2914007,5,B000U1ZV76,Great movies 3/4  are widescreen.  COPYCAT CAT IS FULL FRAME!  I contacted WB  and they replaced copycat with a proper  dvd,1305072000,14,123,4.666666666666667
2914008,4,B000U1ZV76,"What a treat this was, as this collection was inexpensive, but the movies contained within were extradordinarily good value.  Each movie stands alone as excellent viewing. Copycat, with the superbly intellectual but sublime Sigorney Weaver battling with a baby faced psychopath whilst battling her demons, has you on the edge of your seat throughout. Diabolique was surprising good as was The Crush, and Pacific Heights really is an unusual film with brilliant acting and has a very menacing plot. This collection is worth every cent!",1292716800,3,534,5.2823529411764705
2914009,5,B000U1ZV76,"I'd never bought a 4-pack DVD before, but I'm *very* pleased with this one being my first :D I loved Pacific Heights as well as the Crush (two films I'd seen previously), and I got the chance to see Copycat and Diabolique, which were also very good films. If you're looking for a great way to spend your weekend, and you love thriller films as I do, I would definately reccomend this DVD to you. I really couldn't have asked for anything better!",1282953600,2,445,4.373493975903615

I investigated this issue and found that this product error is a reason for this going out of print. Future buyers need to be warned of this before buying, especially if they plan to purchase this specifically for Copycat which was the case for me.

IT DOES NOT WORK AND IS A VERY, VERY , VERY BAD COPY OF 4 MOVIES OF WHICH I ONLY WANTED TO WATCH ONE OF AND I COULDNT GET IT. IT KEEPS GOING BACK TO ONE MOVIE.",1509321600,,254,3.396551724137931

8211764,4,B000U1ZV76,Silverstone's best as she was just starting out here and was a lot more natural in front of the camera.  And it turns the typical stalker movie on its ear since she is the one to be afraid of here- and with good reason.  Worth a watch.  A lot of people ask why the name of the girl has been obviously changed in later pressings of this film- according to lore the person that the mean girl character is based on sued- so the name was subsequently changed in later editions.  There are four movies included on these dvds but they are a lot more by the numbers with few surprises for the audience and nothing you haven't seen many times before if you're familiar with the thriller genre.  The dvds are double sided with a movie on each side so who knows how well made they are- or how many viewings they will stand up to; but The Crush still makes an impression after all this time. Tara from Buffy The Vampire Slayer has a small role.  But what Silverstone does to the people around her is just brutal even in 2016-  one word-  wasps.,1479168000,,1033,4.23469387755102
