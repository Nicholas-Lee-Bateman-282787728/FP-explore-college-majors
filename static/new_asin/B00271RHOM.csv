We feel more confident now and it's nice to see some of the rolls and stuff from above and below the water from multiple angles.",1343606400,,249,4.555555555555555
8353858,5,B00271RHOM,"Ken Whiting is hands-down the best kayak instructor on video, at least for all the videos I've seen. Everything is explained very well and demonstrated in a way that I can understand.
$50 for this box set of three videos? It's definitely worth your money! I would buy this again! In fact, I did buy this again after I bought all three videos separately and never saw them back again after loaning them out!",1318377600,2,406,4.5

If anyone has a desire to look into this sport, these are the videos to watch. Hey, even for fun and entertainment.",1245888000,2,256,4.354166666666667
