Razor Ramon def. Bam Bam Bigelow: A decent match from both Bigelow and Ramon. 4/10
I.R.S. def. Mabel: Well, the match has Mabel in it so you don't expect it to be any good in the first place. I've seen a LOT worse matches from Mabel than this one though. I.R.S. gets the win by pinning Mabel after he had just missed a splash. 1/10
Owen Hart def. Tatanka: Owen carried Tatanka throughout this entire match, otherwise it would have really sucked. Owen gets the win to advance in the tournament. 2/10
1-2-3 Kid def. Jeff Jarrett: Short but good. 6/10
WWF Championship Match- Diesel def. Bret Hart(c) by DQ: This was Diesel's first good match, ever. Diesel wins the match by DQ after Jim Neidhart interferes, but Bret retains the title. 6.5/10
Semi-Final - Razor Ramon def. I.R.S.: Not a very good match. Razor gets the win after hitting the Razor's Edge on I.R.S. 0.5/10
Semi-Fianl - Owen Hart def. 1-2-3 Kid: The best match of the entire event, but it was way too short. 8.5/10
Tag Team Championship Match - The Headshrinkers(c) def. Yokozuna and Crush: Certainly not the worst match of the show. Fatu gives Crush a super kick and then pins him for the win. 0/10
King of the Ring Final- Owen Hart def. Razor Ramon: Owen Hart goes off the top rope with an elbow drop and then pins Razor Ramon for the win to become the King of the Ring. No matter how good or bad this match is, it was still a peak moment in the great career of the late Owen Hart. 4/10
Roddy Piper def. Jerry Lawler: THIS is the worst match of the show and it gets a negative rating. -4/10
A slightly recommended video that features a great moment in the career of Owen Hart and a very rare happening: Diesel actually had a good match.",1073865600,,1717,4.385579937304075
587895,2,6303159524,"In this edition of Coliseum Video's King of the Ring '94, the video is highlighted by the Champ vs. Champ battle between Bret ""Hitman"" Hart and Diesel. The other hightlight is the surprising guest in the show in Jim Neidhart and Roddy Piper. In all this video is disappointing for lack of true stars in the company and lacks in consistancy through matches like good matches and then bad matches. The only reason to get this tape is to see how ""The Rocket"" Owen Hart won the 1994 King of the Ring.",1040342400,,496,4.4021739130434785

7840069,4,6303159524,"I was going thru old WWF VHS tapes and I pulled this out of a pile, I cant even remember where I got it. I looked at the card and was quite impressed with the line up so I decided to watch it.

The video opens with the heels in the tournament moving there names to the finals. Harmless fun but it's what made WWF fun and something you rarely see in WWE today.

Bam Bam Bigelow VS Razor Ramon: This was a good way to open up the PPV. Both men were full of energy, had a great match, and I thought the ending was well done with Ramon advancing.

IRS VS Mabel: Mabel can wrestle I won't be cruel like most reviewers are towards him. Im not saying he is Yokozuna or Earthquake but he can put on good matches. However, this isn't one of them. IRS wins after Mabel falls off the top rope and IRS hooks the leg and ropes for the win.

Owen Hart VS Tatanka: Tatanka did every move he knows and still couldn't put away Owen Hart. This was Tatanka's first PPV loss. The ending was stupid.

Jeff Jarrett VS 123 Kid: An alright match with the annoucers kept on saying how the Kid was an underdog so it kind of gave away the results in a way. Jarrett piledrives the Kid three times after the match.

IC Champion Diesel (with Shawn Michaels) VS World Champion Bret Hart (with Jim Neidhart): With two men on the outside, a good five minutes passed before Michaels started to interfere. This was a really good match with Neidhart interfering and costing Hart the match. It was funny because Hart was mad Neidhart did this but Diesel was a heel and he retained the title so it seems stupid to upset over it.

Razor Ramon VS IRS: The wrestled at the Royal Rumble five months before. This ending was cleaner but I thought the match had something missing.

123 Kid VS Owen Hart: Announcers kept saying the Kid was injuried and wasn't going make it but he did. This is probably the best match of 1994 and was under four minutes. Non-stop action as Randy Savage said he was going retire due to the moves of both Owen and the Kid. Im surprised this has never made onto a dvd of some sort. Just purely awesome.

Headshrinkers VS Crush and Yokozuna: Not a bad match but really didn't click. Lex Luger comes down towards the end, distracting Crush and Yoko. The end came off camera as it focused on Luger.

Razor Ramon VS Owen Hart: Not the best match considering the two involved. Neidhart interferes, closelines Ramon, throws him into the post, rolls him into the ring, and Owen finishes him off with a nice looking top rope elbow.

Roddy Piper VS Jerry Lawler: A terrible main event. Not even worth watching. I cant belive Diesel VS Bret Hart wasn't the main event.

Overall, I enjoyed it. It's not classic but it had some good matches. The only problem was Art Donovan on commentary and he was awful. I don't even know why WWF put him on the event. Alot of matches had all refs coming down to break up a post match beat down. Hart-Kid is a lost classic and needs to be released to dvd ASAP. I know WWE has discussed releasing King of the Rings in a set but don't hold your breath for that.",1308355200,,3067,4.259896729776248
7840070,4,6303159524,"All the quarter-final matches were pretty good/smash-mouth brwals. The World Championship between Bret Hart & Diesel(Kevin Nash) was a solid,entertaining back-and-forth bout. The semi-final matches were nice back-and-forth bouts. The Tag Team Championship match between The Haedshrinkers & The Team of Crush and Yokozuna was a pretty much a power brawl but still a match to enjoy. The K.O.T.R finals was just as good as the rest of the matches in the tournament. The Jerry Lawler-Roddy Piper match was a sloppy,poor brawl. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1301529600,,555,5.1098901098901095
7840071,3,6303159524,"WWE 24/7 once again allowed me to relive an old school PPV in the King Of The Ring 1994.  For those who don't know or don't rememeber, the King Of The Ring PPV was based on a tournament (similar to how the Royal Rumble PPV is based off the battle royal match itself) that was a single elimination which ment that you had to win your match or else your out of the tournament.  The first round matches were 15 mins., second round was 30, and the finals had an hour time limit.

Razor Ramon vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Two of the guys Bret fought last year go against each other this year & this was better than Bigelow's opening match last year but not the same level as Razor's last year against Bret.  It was Razor trying to match power with power against Bigelow only for it to keep working in favor of Bigelow until Razor was able to use Bigelow's momentum against him to pick up the victory.

Mabel vs. I.R.S. - This was just a decent match here between these two here as I.R.S. carried Mabel to a better performance than we usually get from him.

Owen Hart vs. Tatanka - This was an exibition match for Owen Hart as he dominated it a majority of the bout with Tatanka making a comeback before Owen won & moved on the next round.

1-2-3- Kid vs. Jeff Jarrett - Average match with the Kid (as usual during this time) playing the underdog role against Double J before getting the quick upset.  The real story of this match was the aftermath that would effect the Kid throughout the rest of the tournament.

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs. Intercontinental Champion Diesel - This was a rare champion vs. champion match with Shawn Michaels & the suprize return of Jim ""The Anvil"" Niedhart as the cornermen for this match.  Now I'm not a fan of Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash as for as his inring work goes but he always had good series of matches with certain people & Bret Hart is at the top of that list.  Diesel used his power & height advantage (along with Shawn Michaels getting involved at times) while Bret worked on ""brought him down to his size"" by working on his legs & using submission/weardown holds.  Eventhough some might concider the ending a jip, it would all makes sense by the end of the night.  Anyways, this is one of the best Diesel/Kevin Nash matches you'll find that will always get overshadowed by their later encounters in 1995.

Razor Ramon vs. I.R.S. - How ironic that for the second year in a row, Razor has a Royal Rumble rematch.  Unfortunally, their Rumble match was better as they just weren't clicking here in this short match before Razor advanced to the finals.

1-2-3 Kid vs. Owen Hart - Boy, this match started out with a bang...or better yet, a dropkick through the ropes by Owen while Kid was still walking to the ring.  This was fast paced non stop action in the short time they had & the best match thoughout the entire tournament.

WWF Tag Team Champions Headshrinkers vs. Yokozuna & Crush - As a ironic side note for those who don't already know, Yokozuna is a member of the famous samoan Anoki family, the cousin of both Headshrinkers Samu & Fatu a.k.a. Rikishi, and nephew of Wild Samoan Afa who's the manager of the Headshrinkers.  Anyways, this was a good tag team match between all four men but nothing really noteworthy about it.

King Of The Ring Finals: Razor Ramon vs. Owen Hart - Unfortunally, this match was too short to really turn into a good wrestling match but it was average for what it was.  The bigger story here wasn't the actual match itself but the appearence of Jim ""The Anvil"" Niedhart to help Owen Hart become the 1994 King Of The Ring & go on as the ""King Of Harts.""
As a personal note, I know many people concider Owen pinning Bret at WrestleMania X in Madison Square Garden as Owen Hart's crowning moment but that ended up getting overshadowed by the Ladder Match & Bret winning the belt back later in the night.  This PPV to me was Owen's crowning moment as he won the King Of The Ring tournament & was the talk of the night by the end of the PPV.  Long live Owen Hart.

Roddy Piper vs. Jerry Lawler - I'm not even going to try to summerize this match because it was just horrible.  So horrible to the point where Jerry Lawler didn't want to talk about it on Roddy Piper's DVD.  A bad way to end the show.

In the end, this years tournament wasn't as good as the previous years but they made up with it with 2 out of the 3 undercard matches to make this just an average PPV.  The real highlights here was the first Diesel/Hart match along with Owen's performances in the tournament. Overall, if your a fan of Owen Hart's then I would recommend.",1217548800,,4592,4.351699882766706
7840072,5,6303159524,"This was the greatest King Of The Ring of all time in my opinion. I think it was a wonderful event that helped kick off what would become a very memorable summer for the World Wrestling Federation. It happened on June 19th, 1994. One of the coolest parts of this event happened before the actual pay-per-view. Todd Pettengill, currently a radio DJ on WPLJ in New York City, hosted a pre-show in which he and Johnny Polo (Raven) ran down all the situations that led to the Superstars advancing to the Quarter Final Round. The actual pay-per-view started off with Razor Ramon and the late, great Bam Bam Bigelow locking up to see who would advance to the Semi Final Round. NFL Football great and Baltimore legend Art Donovan joins Gorilla Monsoon and Macho Man Randy Savage for commentary. The event happened in Baltimore, explaining why Donovan joined them, although he seems to not know a wristlock from a wristwatch. Hot Rod Rowdy Roddy Piper and Jerry ""the King"" Lawler also square off in a match that often gets a bad rap,  but in all actuality is pretty good. Bret Hart and Diesel have their first of what would become 3 really cool matches. K.O.T.R. '94 also sees the return of Bret's brother-in-law and former Hart Foundation partner, Jim ""the Anvil"" Neidhart. The return of the Anvil is a double-edged sword, though, as he winds up helping Bret's then feuding brother, Owen, win the King Of The Ring tournament. It is a very cool ppv that you really should add to your collection. Another 1994 5 star classic.",1183420800,,1516,4.656716417910448

Baltimore, Maryland

Quaterfinal Match in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Mabel V. IRS

IRS wins in a sleeper. And I do mean a sleeper. *

Tatanka V. Owen Hart

Good match. Good back & Forth action. Owen wins. ***1/4

Quaterfinal Match in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

1-2-3 Kid V. Jeff Jarrett

Anoother good match. The Kid pulls the upset and beat Jarrett. ***

WWF Championship:

Bret Hart (Champion) V. Diesel

Bret works his magic and has another awesome match with Diesel. Shawn Michaels was at ringside with Diesel and Bret said that he was going to have a family member in this corner and that family member was Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart. Great back and forth action and then Diesel hits the Jack Knive and then The Anvl comes in and hits Diesel. We will never know if Bret could kick out of the Jack Knive and Diesel wins by DQ. Awesome match. **** However did the Anvil save Bret's title for Bret or is did he save it for someone else?

Semi-Final Match in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Razor Ramon V. IRS

Ok match with IRS in control of most of it and then Razor wins. **1/2

Semi-Final Match in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

1-2-3 Kid V. Owen Hart

Awesome match even thought it was like four minutes long. Owen wins with the Sharpshooter. **** Yes a four start match that was four minutes long. Who knows how good it could have been if given more time.

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Headshrinkers (Champions) V. Crush & Yokozuna

Crush is my favorite Dave Matthews Band song. Anyways, the match was ok with the shrinkers winning with Lex Lugars help. **1/4

Finals in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Razor Ramon V. Owen Hart

Wait a second, The Anvil is with Owen. Interesting. The match was ok. They were both tired. Owen wins with Anvil help. ** Owen is the 1994 King Of The Ring. I get it now. The Anvil saved Bret's title so Owen could beat Bret and that his title. It's all making sence know. I love this storyline. It's my favorite storyline ever even though Austin and McMahon was a little bit more interesting.

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper V. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

umm....sloppy match with a sloppy finish and I don't see why this match was so high on the card. Piper wins. 1/4*

Overall a good show. This show has a bad rep to it but I think that it's awesome seeing the Bret V. Owen storyline unfold.",1129507200,,2590,4.39662447257384
