7883016,4,6305104638,"Even though the cut it shorter than the actual film [Xenon VHS Version], it still get the point across that this film is KICK ASS!

Hwang Jung Lee and a his display of a Ching Dynasty official with a nasty, cocky attitude was the BEST! I mean he was talking some major s*** to folks and backing it up.

Also, I can't forget about Yuen Woo Ping choreography is still best in the business even for a late 70's flick.

I am giving this 3 1/2 stars for the well-written script and insane action scenes.",1463356800,,498,4.221052631578948
7883017,5,6305104638,"For this movie I like the wu tang collection preview they have before the movie starts.
The beginning of the movie & the eagle claw master fight a young renegade dude, the 2 old man fight , the part where John Liu fights while being capture on the road with the guy in the red robed suit & the last 25 minutes are so are the parts to watch.",1387497600,,340,3.9420289855072466
7883018,5,6305104638,Those who know real Kung Fu movies Invincible Armour is truly a classic film simply because the sequences of the movie are excellent. Also to mention the superb display of fighting skill and  coreographic action it's a must see for real Kung Fu fans.,1121904000,,250,4.681818181818182
7883019,5,6305104638,"From the start this movie is nothing but awesome. The only people
who would not like this movie are the ones who just saw ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" those of us who were watching these movies since we were kids could understand the moves and the style of Jon Liu and Hwang Jang Lee. These guys are right up there with the venom mob,chen kwan tai and all the other greats. This movie is a must have for true fans.",1007856000,,417,4.225
7883020,2,6305104638,"Man, did I waste my cash yet again on Wu Tang garbage.  I thought I had found a movie I had been looking for for many years, but what I found was heartache.  This entire series is a total grab bag.  I've found excellent movies and I've found tripe.  Well, maybe tripe is too nice a word.
The fighting was fair at best; I think the director was more taken with the lead's ability to hold his foot straight up over his head.  I don't even remember how many times they showed that stunt in the movie.  The best thing about owning this video is the homo-erotic picture on the back of the protagonist searching for the bad guy's weak spot.  Probably not worth the money, though.",976579200,2,673,4.251968503937008
7883021,2,6305104638,"This is one of John Liu's best,however, what a pitty that there are 5 scenes that have been deleted and this does not make sense for me.  I strongly do not want any one to buy this movie.  I bought one and then  returned it.  If the original edition is being sold somewhere in a DVD  edition, please let me know.  Many thanks.",959644800,4,326,4.095238095238095
7883022,2,6305104638,"I had heard many good things about 'Invincible Armor', and was happy to find this video on Amazon.com.  I watched the video with somebody who had seen it before, however, and he pointed out that in this edition, at least  2 key  fighting scenes have been abruptly deleted-- including one scene  pictured on the back of the box, and the final scene explaining the armor's  fatal weakness.  The story doesn't make sense without these elements.",946339200,2,441,4.8133333333333335
