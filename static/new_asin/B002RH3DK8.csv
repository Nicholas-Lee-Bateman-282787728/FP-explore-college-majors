3974426,2,B002RH3DK8,"Despite the host being terribly boring, this is still a mildly interesting documentary, but only because it would be hard for this subject matter to not elicit one or two intriguing opinions.  However, there was no reason to talk to the ""folk artist"" about his broken tractor and alligators. Nor do I think the Christian wrestler or the drag racer serve any purpose other than showing some people apply their faith in strange and prosaic ways.  These kinds of interviews don't add to the discussion about the nature of existence; they are simply short biographies on people who believe things without giving any good reason to believe them.

If I made a documentary about global warming, I wouldn't include an interview of a farmer who just says, ""I'm a farmer and global warming is true.""  It's irrelevant.  In the same vein, filming your obviously-coached neighbor's 7th-grade daughter makes your film seem amateurish and cheesy.

Then there's the goofy man ""Aha"" who answers ""Where do the voices in our head (like our conscience) come from""?  with: ""From the place where the birds make their sound.""  Aha is an unkempt, obese, ""awakened being"" who has several props like a crystal cane, an ankh cross, bead necklace and tarot cards. The filmmaker speaks briefly to scientists like Dawkins and Susskind and skeptic Dr. Shermer but most of the conversations are either with spiritual figures or complete laypersons who give one-liners and there's often no follow-up question to elaborate on what their platitudes mean. E.g., ""Truth is what the Torah says.""  Gee, that's profound.

My biggest criticism of film making in this style is that too often, directors try to cram in dozens of interviews instead of having a few good ones.  When someone says something like ""Electrons don't really exist,"" the filmmaker should ask for deeper explanation.  Otherwise, it's like saying ""Parthenogenesis is possible,"" and then moving on to another question. I think it's better to watch a debate online between, say, Hitchens and David Wolpe or Sam Harris and Deepak Chopra, because at least there is an opportunity to elaborate on claims with deeper explanation.

Overall, this documentary does not add anything original or particularly memorable to the conversation about the nature of existence. This filmmaker's final statement is something akin to ""No one knows anything for sure about existence, but learning is fun and we should keep trying to figure out why we're all here.""",1299974400,19,2471,5.086633663366337

3974430,5,B002RH3DK8,"I went to a screening of ""The Nature of Existence"" when it was in the theaters last summer.  This film provides a lot of food for thought.  In fact, it's multi-course meal of interviews with preachers, painters, ascetics, astrophysicists, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, secularists and seventh graders.  Along with the interviewees, the viewer gets to chew on such questions as ""Why are we here?"", ""Is there a purpose to it all?"", ""What happens when we die?' and other meaty topics.  In the end, though, the movie is really just an appetizer.  The entree comes when the viewer carries on the conversation with friends and family.

This is a project I know I would have greatly enjoyed doing myself as it is fascinating to get the perspective of such a diverse group of human beings.  This is an excellent series that will be appreciated by people who are open to the possibilities regarding existence.  If you have closed your mind and decided that you have the ""one true answer"" this DVD is not for you.  Nygard does an excellent job of getting the subjects of his interviews/discussions to open up and really communicate how they feel about this timeless subject.  Mr. Nygard has a well-thought out website that is a companion to this DVD where you can join in on the ongoing conversation about the metaphysical issued raised by this project at [...]  I recommend visiting the website so you can answer the 85 questions about your perspective on the Nature of Existence.",1292803200,5,973,4.694117647058824

Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more;"" - William Shakespeare

Well ""The Nature of Existence (2010 documentary)"" is quite befuddling and that it is not a dissertation on existence as much is a survey on obscure and flamboyant religions. Two thirds of this presentation could probably have been cut out unless of course those just having to be the two thirds that you were looking for. I suspect that the presenter Roger Nygard was using this documentary is a way to pay for his vacation.

The drawback in this presentation like many today is that it is an a sound bite snippet format as we bounce back and forth between different people in different locations with different agendas as they get to speak one sentence at a time versus one person in one location with one agenda completing one thought.

Personally I was particularly interested in the interview with the Paiute Tribe. As a kid I was always fascinated by Native American creation stories.

I do not mean to make this presentation appear totally flippant; if you pay attention to some of the questions and answers you may find some insights to ""the nature of existence.""",1292630400,,1321,4.632478632478633
3974433,1,B002RH3DK8,"Remember when as a young, innocent child you used to ask the sweetest and most philosophical questions for your age group: Our mission on earth, reasons for our existence, God's need for our love, or why people that don't go to church are condemned to suffer. These were questions that bothered my friends, and me, from childhood till I completed middle school. With the philosophy that I studied in high school and college, I cannot claim I know the definite or correct answers for these questions, but I do have an answer for these questions. With many other philosophical pursuits in life, as I reached an answer, I stopped worrying or pondering the nature of my existence-for I already established it. Roger Nygard is asking these questions from prominent people from across the world, and trying to reach the definite answer for our existence, so that we may undertake the best or only acceptable path.

Roger was influenced by 9/11, which made our morality seem so vivid, to conduct this search. Beginning by interviewing countless friends, he eventually converses to the most prominent and prolific men living today: Orson Scott Card, Richard Dawkins, Irvin Kershner, and other famous scientists and artists. The question is seemingly clear cut: What is the nature of existence, or for what reason are we on this planet? It is a question that many adolescent men and women have possibly thought of, many have answered for themselves, and a minority left unanswered. Acknowledging that the answer will not be easy to access, Roger concedes that he'll attempt to attain the most basic reasons and goals for human existence; purpose that humans, regardless of religion, cultural differences, or sexual orientation can identify and accept.

On his path toward this noble answer, Roger subliminally realizes an important fact: culture intertwines man's mind to such a degree that his views will conflict with other cultures, religions, and customs to vast degrees. It may be unfair to claim that he does not comprehend this, but he does seem to believe he can overcome, and find some rational answer shared by all humans. He interviews his friend's daughter, finding that she would not enjoy the constant ""happiness"" of Heaven, or that one of his friend's finds procreation of our species, or simply ""sex,"" as the only reason for our existence.

On a limited scope, Roger succeeds in gathering around a group of intelligent people to speak on this topic. The astrophysicist and Roger's friend's daughter are the most thought-provoking interviewees. The astrophysicist has astonishing theories concerning the conception and development of the universe, earth and its inhabitants. The seventh grader, however, steals the show in an unlikely manner. Her conversations are not metaphysical or existentialist, but with her youthful and charming perspective, she presents a negative view of God and his alternate domain that balances out the zealot views of the monotheist. Most other guest are either mildly compelling and interesting or disappointing in their disregard for the issue, resolving to crude jokes or views.

Nygard needs to produce a feature length, and as a result, he has a produced a film where countless views, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, or Buddhist, are redundantly expressed in the film. The film's major mistake is that it assumes, or wants the audience to perceive, that THE Muslim believes in one point for existence. Surely, most of us have heard of Shia and Sunni or Catholic and Protestant. So, it seems rather insufficient that by interviewing a Muslim, he has fundamentally given that faith justice in regards to their beliefs. People of different faiths are categorized in different sects, and within those sects not everyone is truly knowledgeable of the faith.

Roger Nygard seems like a wholesome, family man capable of conducting a pleasant interview with all his subjects by allowing them to speak freely, and without interruption. And what a horrifying method this is. An interviewer need not be as persistent as Michael Moore or as persuasive or comedic as an experienced comedian, such as Chris Rock, but the tone of Nygard is atrociously insipid. It is obvious that he has no prior knowledge of much of the Eastern philosophies or religions, and he cannot respond to the claims or guidelines these people follow or obey. His politeness is not due to his civility toward his subjects, but his sheer incapability to offer any insight or add to the discussion. He is merely the cameraman who has also been allowed to explain the intents and goals of this documentary and introduce the subjects. Nygard's comedy rather than seeming funny comes across as a dire attempt of inducing comedy by a man who is unfit to do so. This is unmistakably Nygard's film, as it seems highly doubtful that many people would grant such an intriguing premise to a man whose insight on this issue is next to zero. It would seem more fascinating if based on each country, and its respective religion or philosophy, new interviewers with familiarity with the subject at hand were introduced, as to be able to debate the views of the interviewee on the nature of existence.

However, the premise of the film is also poorly thought out. After the Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, or Taoist presents his views on the point of existence, the conversation lags. Nygard limits himself by presenting only once question, but such an overarching question that he is unacceptable in introducing any other question or discussion, or even answering this question. It is obvious what the Muslim or Christian will answer to the question, but why does he give that answer, or for what reason does he believe his God or outlook on life and death are more realistic. Unfortunately, besides focusing the camera for close-shot or taking notes in relation to the interview, Nygard concludes the film with a thud. As I exited the theater, I did not feel dimmer than when the film began, but it seemed like I had watched one of those cheep products my high school used to produce to protest and condemn racism, sexism, and bullying. This film is not only unsuccessful in its intents, but also is cheaply made, as its animations-that supposedly introduce the topics-brought back the nostalgic feeling of the good high school educational films. After a couple of hours of meditation, I found that I had learned that different people think there are different reasons for existing or living, and there are no single reasons we can agree with each other. How utterly fascinating!",1280016000,24,6559,5.029438822447102

Making this film was his passion three years ago when he was traveling to northern Nevada as a guest of the Paiute Tribe to document a remembrance ceremony and speak with some tribal members.  In this film, Roger employs his signature documentary style of stunning visual images and interesting (and often humorous) characters, with quick cut editing among them to answer his four basic questions about the nature of existence.  The format of the film is laid out in a similar manner to the Trekkies films, but with one new element added... we see Roger, and occasionally his crew or friends, on camera.  I think it's this personal perspective that really makes some of the foreign and more radical or complex points of view stand out.  The most memorable scene for me was an outdoor public debate on the UCLA campus when Roger's stand-up comedian friend, Stevie Ray Fromstein, confronts Brother Jed, who is such a backwards radically fundamentalist town cryer that people appear to be entertained rather than insulted by his rants as they mock him for Roger's camera.

3974453,4,B002RH3DK8,"I suggest watching ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" for a reality check before watching this.

Yay...A good way to be introduced and get educated with a good glimpse of the massive variety of wackos out there. It's glaringly obvious that if humans were put here for good purposes then with 8 billion plus people (as of 2013 estimates) the world should be a better place than it ever has been d/t the most humans living in history...Reality check...definitely not the case...more species are going extinct and the massive global pollution problems are just a couple of the many things that prove humans are an exponentially growing plague more than anything else...and several of these wackos prove it.

Too much industry, too much pollution, too many cars, not enough food or clean water...yes, these are problems but they are not the root problem. The root problem (and scientific fact) is all the people consuming all the resources and creating all the waste. In many peoples opinions, if you want to stop contributing to the problem then you should probably set your religious and cultural beliefs aside and stop having kids. Want to actually help? Adopt a child that needs a home. It is very selfish to want to have your own kids when so many children need a home. By both not having children and adopting you actually help in 2 ways...you don't make the problem any bigger and you help a child that needs a home. Conversely, by having children and not adopting you make the problem worse 2-fold by adding more people (future consumers) to the problem and again by not adopting a child that actually does needs a home...a very simple blunt truth even though you may not like hearing it.

Objective truth will always be stronger than subjective belief. That is why science has and will continue to contribute more to our understanding of humanity and nature more than any religion has or ever will. Science spans most all religions and is the best way we know how (at present time) to study the works of God or Gods (or whatever you believe) to the best of our ability with what was given to us. Science continually searches for truth and quickly adapts to a new truth if / when it is proven wrong. What faith or religion does that?

After thousands of years, religion still had us stuck in the stone ages with horses and carts, conducting blood-lettings, burning witches, performing exorcisms, killing infidels, suppressing women, allowing slavery, not eating potatoes (they were once considered evil since they grew underground), eating uncooked meats, drinking untreated water, and conducting surgery with non-sterile instruments (there is way to much to list here)...and we would likely not live much past the age of 40.

In only a couple of hundred years science and technology has doubled our life expectancy, gave us vaccines and safe water, refrigerated our food, taken us into the sky and to the moon, explained our solar system, universe, nature, biology, genetics, provided equal rights (for women and abolished slavery), gave us plastics, multiple forms of energy (electricity, solar, wind, hydro, nuke), radio, TV, medicine, computers, pharmaceuticals...etc...much too much to list here and the list will keep growing. Yes, that's right, science has allowed us to breed like crazy and live longer...a very ironic 2-edged sword so to speak...lol!

Quite simply, we were put here to experience life and the huge variety it offers...good/bad, strength/weakness, love/hate, pleasure/pain, wealth/poverty, illness/health, youth/growing old...etc.

Most religions shun killing and preach peace and tolerance...unless you are not of that religion...then it's OK to kill in the name of whoever your God is. Manifest destiny, crusades, Spanish inquisition, Shia vs Sunni, etc. are proof of religious bloodbaths in which none actually practiced what they preached...I have no use of that hypocrisy in my life.

I believe in a higher power...but not in any organized religion inherently run by hypocrites. I also practice what I preach and do not have any children...thank God! I sleep soundly at night. Good luck in sorting it out and finding your way.",1485475200,3,4154,5.036390101892286

It cannot come from humans because I can say it's ok to lie and someone else can say it's not ok to lie.  This is false because if you believe in contradictions, you believe in truth claims, therefore you should believe God exists.  Which God?  The God who has revealed Himself (youtube in search for the real mount sinai- where moses met God)  There is evil in the world where did that come from?  Man makes up truth because we are a liar, and the main reason why many people don't want the God of the Bible is because He's authentic.  I don't have to go into ""complex ways to get you to believe"" that's not my job, the fact is Jesus came Not to condemn the world but to save the world however you have to ask Him for forgiveness in this lifetime.  Following Him can be hard but if you want to live and become a new person, and have peace in hard times and really love others read the Gospels would be a good starting place.  Hell is real, Jesus is returning soon and like the woman at the well who was pretty much committing adultery with 5 people, Jesus forgave her and she never went back to that lifestyle, Christians aren't perfect but they are forgivin and they have the power to say no to sin.

Who is to say one of those is not the right belief.

3974471,5,B002RH3DK8,"An intelligent film from a director who has devoted much time and effort to seeking answers to timeless spiritual questions. During these interviews, it clear that human consciousness is evolving, and people are outgrowing the dogmas of the past. It is refreshing to see that people across the world are thinking for themselves and no longer want to feel the fear and guilt that is promulgated by some religious doctrines. The message comes across loud and clear: when it comes to faith - there is no proof that anyone is right or wrong. Everyone is entitled to have their unique opinions on spirtual subjects and no one is going to punish them for expressing their intuitive truths.

The film moves along at a brisk pace and offers straightforward, relevant, and meaningful insights into the universal spiritual mindset that is replacing the mythologies of the past.",1301788800,3,867,4.979310344827586
3974472,5,B002RH3DK8,"This was an eye-opening, uplifting film. And despite the polarizing and controversial topic, it was surprisingly lighthearted and dare I say fun. I think this is because the director made it personal. You feel like you're on a road trip with him, just sitting down and chatting with a bunch of people that are really interesting (and some quite bizarre). Frankly, I'm amazed at the openness and honesty of the interviewees. Nygard must have a real knack for making people feel comfortable and unthreatened. Also, I was impressed by the balanced portrayal of all religions, with no trace of agenda or mockery. This is a film that can build bridges and open dialogue between people of varying viewpoints.",1301270400,15,702,4.9576271186440675
3974473,5,B002RH3DK8,"News flash!
This movie is not meant to be a course in Applied Pompous Pseudo-Philosophy. It is more like the real definiton of 'philosophia', love of wisdom. It has something called a sense of humor in it. The Vulcans who wrote the bad reviews can look that up on Wikipedia.
This is not asinine hair-splitting. It's entertaining and thought-provoking, and will be a conversation starter for a diverse audience, not a boring ego convention that many here want it to be.
There's still time to argue at your local community college. Oh, never mind, the Internet was made for porn. And arguing.

3974475,2,B002RH3DK8,"For ninety minutes a middle-aged white American male, who doesn't tell us much about himself, interviews anyone who will agree to talk, from the kid next door to Richard Dawkins to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.  They discuss the big questions:  Why are we here?  What does it mean to be human?  Is there a soul?  What happens when we die? What is the meaning of life?  Unfortunately each person gets to speak for less than two minutes, hardly enough time to explain life, the universe and everything (unless you're Douglas Adams and the answer is ""42"").

By about half way through its clear the film-maker isn't getting anywhere, he isn't narrowing things down, just continuing to roam the world questioning.  Not surprisingly, he concludes that  we need to keep on questioning and learning, otherwise we start dying.  I was just waiting for him to say ""life is like a box of chocolates...""

Perhaps the most interesting idea he missed out on was the one that could have helped him most.  The Buddha called these kind of questions The Unanswerables.  He refused to address them because he believed there was no way to know.  Speculating about them would simply drive you to distraction (as this film ably demonstrates).  More important, he said, is to understand how you know.  If you understand this, you understand what is knowable, what is not, and how to live accordingly.

If you're just starting out on your own journey of questioning, this film might actually be a good place to start.  It shows quite clearly how little we understand.  The Buddha seems to have called it pretty well during the Iron Age.  Here we are 2500 years later going round and round on the same questions and getting no closer to a ""real"" answer.

8378723,3,B002RH3DK8,This documentary is just too all over the place. Quantity over quality. He interviews a million people but never dives far into any of their beliefs. I felt like the movie was just thumbing through a Rolodex and I couldn't keep up with what I was watching or what the people were saying. I had to turn on subtitles because the people were just moving through and talking too fast. Most of the people are absolute cuckoo clocks. I didn't really enjoy it.

As a former Christian, now atheist with some leanings towards reincarnations and ""vibrations"" philosophy I could 100% percent relate to the film and its purpose. But, wow, let me say this has certainly expanded my knowledge in religious philosophies.  It was interesting to see how simple some people lived (the man and the alligators) and how lavish others lived (20G for 20 minutes with the Pope?!?).  And some was rather sad especially the man in Mississippi who had one of the best points in the documentary, I think.  Just all of it.  It was so amazing to see myself in so many others, I know everyone is on a journey but until watching this I guess I just never really could visualize it. Irvin Kershner also stood out with his bit of no one IS really but people experience happiness.  I had never thought about it in those terms which I know seems silly but until I heard that- and now I realize how much I am using I.  Hahahahahaha, but I guess that's how I'm alive and know I can still make choices.  Roger's friend was great also- especially the part about how he knows maybe he's making a bigger deal out of religion than he should but there are wars over this stuff and he is correct. Eastern culture and Western culture.  Native American culture that I'm very much interested in looking deeper into.

Very, very thought provoking and unexpectedly comforting.",1489795200,,1486,4.548872180451128

I can only imagine the high praise reviews were created by those involved with the film or by their friends and family. Because the only other option is that many people genuinely found this trite tripe informative and thought provoking.. which is on the whole a much more terrifying notion.",1489104000,2,674,4.616666666666666
