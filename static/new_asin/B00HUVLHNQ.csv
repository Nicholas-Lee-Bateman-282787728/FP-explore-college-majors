6227755,5,B00HUVLHNQ,"Wanted to watch two previous Thor movies before new Thor this summer. Great movies, great price!",1508803200,,96,5.0625
6227756,5,B00HUVLHNQ,I absolutely love this set. Marvel movies are expensive and buying these two in a local store would have cost me at least 50 dollars separately. This was very convenient as a price considering it they are also blue ray discs. All in all a great purchase with quick shipping.,1507161600,,274,4.5

6227759,4,B00HUVLHNQ,"We liked Thor and am fans of the Avengers ~ We saw the first Thor, but not the Dark World (#2).  Since the 3rd movie is coming out in November 2017, we thought we could get the set and watch both before #3 came out.  It also was a good price to get both in the set.",1504137600,,265,3.6315789473684212

6227762,5,B00HUVLHNQ,After researching through reviews and determining that my player was region free I still had doubts about dropping 35 dollars on something that had a 50/50 chance of working. I took the risk and was highly impressed. Both Thor movies are included in their own cases. Both movies are no different than their US releases except a few minor difference on the cover and the case being the thickness of a PS4 game. Package was handle with care. No broken cases or loose discs during it's travels to my movie shelf,1503014400,3,508,4.593406593406593

6227808,2,B00HUVLHNQ,This isn't a review of the movies but the quality of the box set. I received the box two days after I bought it but one of the blue ray cases was broken but not the other. Disappointed that it was damaged,1496966400,2,204,3.880952380952381

6228049,5,B00HUVLHNQ,"With the way Marvel is pumping out our favorite Super Hero movies these days,Don't waste your time getting DVD's separately anymore. Wait for the boxed sets like this one. You get two in one & pay the same amount of money. I like Thor - not as much as Captain America. I enjoyed the first one but in my typical pattern,I was disappointed & bored by the sequel. My husband  however,  is much easier to please & he found both equally entertaining. Because I got this as a gift for him & he liked it, I am giving  it 5 stars. If it were me,I would have given it a mid road 3 star rating because in my opinion,the sequel was not up to par.",1453680000,5,635,4.064

6228083,5,B00HUVLHNQ,"As described. Kind of seems like the two separate BD's were thrown into a box to make this ""double pack"" but it is what it is. Both contain all the features/extras of the respective single BD, so nothing is missed by being them separately.
