8462673,5,B0009TKQPG,"The Promise Land is a wonderful book to use read and use in classes to help in understanding some of the troubles of the religious strife of the middle east. When presented on TV, it is difficult to know which country and peoples are from which countries and on which side of the wars.  This book explains the strife each country is going through and why...the people are merely pawns in the middle of the strife, as often is the case.  This is an excellent book to assist high school and college students to understand the current issues in the middle east and their effect on and the place of the USA in their strife.",1344729600,,619,4.373913043478261
