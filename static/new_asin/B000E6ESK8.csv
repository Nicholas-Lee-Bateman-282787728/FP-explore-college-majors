8106463,5,B000E6ESK8,"The three films are fantastic, I had not seen Titus before and it is a difficult play (read the play several times, but the Tempest is my favorite) to find outside of an anthology. Titus comes with two discs, there is a documentary and Q and A with costume designer. Nice...",1332979200,4,274,4.392156862745098
8106464,4,B000E6ESK8,"i love the modern version of titus. the midsummer night's dream was also wonderfully done. the romeo and juliet was just too damned sissy-pants for me, though. if not for john leguizamo, the rating would be lower.",1238025600,6,213,4.783783783783784
8106465,4,B000E6ESK8,"Amazon is not at all consistent when providing shoppers with the technical specs of DVDs in general and multi-disk box sets in particular; specifically whether or not they're all ANAMORPHIC.
I assumed (incorrectly) that this version of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' would be anamorphic, as are the other two DVDs in the box set. Turns out it's the same NON-anamorphic, widescreen letterbox version released on 25 January 2001 (UPC 086162123085), and occupies less than half the area of a 50"" screen. Six years on, 20th Century Fox still hasn't managed to bring this movie into the 21st century.
Moral: if the description doesn't explicitly say that a DVD is anamorphic, better assume it's not.",1190419200,11,691,5.0701754385964914

8106467,4,B000E6ESK8,"These movies are a real value and a good introduction for modern people to Shakespeare.  They are not done in a very classical way, but rather take a lot of poetic license in their approach.  They are a refreshing interpretation of Shakespeare that are very accessible to a general audience.  Serious Shakespeare fans may want something more traditional, but overall these tapes bring a refreshing approach to these classical plays.  Titus was especially powerful and provides a lot of creative visual interest, great acting and high emotional impact.  While it was a bit disturbing, it was also quite interesting in a way that is unique to Anthony Hopkins.  Purists may want to look elsewhere, but I enjoyed seeing these interpretations and recommend them given the caveats above.",1167350400,26,781,5.110236220472441
