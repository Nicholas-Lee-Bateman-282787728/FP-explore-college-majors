2661871,5,B000ION2E4,This DVD series is awesome.  The content and graphics are engaging and you are spellbound by the awesome photography.,1175558400,2,117,5.157894736842105
2661872,3,B000ION2E4,"If I didn't find the subject matter so interesting I would have turned this off in five minutes.  The background noise (some may call it music) in the soundtrack is so loud that you can barely hear the narrator's voice unless you turn the volume up to pain levels.  I just watched 15 minutes of it and my ears are still ringing!

That said the the perspective of our planet presented in this documentary is quite captivating and the cinematography is first rate.  If you can stand the noise it's well worth watching, but if you want your hearing to last long enough to hear your grandchildren's first words then you may want to avoid watching this one too often.

(Note: this review is based on the broadcast version of the show, not the DVD release.)",1171238400,15,751,4.492647058823529
2661883,5,B000ION2E4,Outstanding!! Very informative geologic history education. Great narration and excellent graphics along with good audio enhances this learning experience.

2661888,5,B000ION2E4,"Try to find a more entertaining video about the origins of the ocean, that incorporates basic ocean principles and vocabulary. Other than How the Earth Was Made (also highly recommended), it's tough to find good Earth science videos that are current and relevant. The majority of videos about the ocean center on lifeforms and add abiotic factors as a sidebar. Yes, the electric guitar soundtrack does intrude a bit at times, and the narration is also not in a style atypical of other documentaries. This does not mean one should turn their nose up at this presentation. On the contrary, I wish more videos would follow a format that appeals to everyone, and not just us documentary aficionados. BONUS- though PG-rated there is no offensive-to-some action or language - ""hell"" - like in the other Amazing Planet video",1398556800,,817,4.927536231884058
2661889,5,B000ION2E4,"I loved Planet Earth, and consider it one of the best films for nature/wildlife. This three-part series did the same for me with nature/geography. I had no problem with the narrator at all, but I can see where geography wouldn't keep some people awake as easily as exotic animals might. Amazing Planet is an amazing investigation of lava, magma, seas, and the power of wind, water and ice. I learned about our planet on many levels I wasn't aware of before, and I think its important for others to grasp it as well- especially in the wake of the Ken Ham and Bill Nye Creationist debate a few weeks ago. When you take in this whole picture, you will likely understand the world and science's ability to decipher it much more clearly than you did before.

Perhaps it boils down to a matter of taste. I have not seen other documentaries focused on geography, that are this beautifully crafted. The three episodes covered the array of forces that continue to systematically mold our planet, with beautiful footage that kept me glued from beginning to end, with no critiques. If you know of a film that more superiorly covers this subject matter, than please leave a comment for me. I will thoroughly enjoy checking that one out as well!",1394323200,,1232,4.651376146788991

2661918,1,B000ION2E4,"There is some great footage and information in the documentary, but the script is so sensational and horribly written I could barely get through it. I can't tell you how many times the words ""catastrophic"", ""devastating"", ""time-bomb"", ""blown to smithereens"", etc etc etc were used. Just horribly written - it was like listening to an hour-long action movie trailer. Skip this.",1363996800,2,376,5.180327868852459
2661919,5,B000ION2E4,"This is not merely a simple documentary with long winded and often times terrible dialogue - with the occasional crap diagrams and images - but instead it is a merger of insightful and useful information packaged in an entertaining manner, filled, no less, with current videos and amazing animation.
The script is nothing short of brilliant, having easily packaged the overwhelming and in most cases boring information into a story that is easily absorbed.
As I watched, I began to imagine how more interesting my classroom could have been IF videos like this existed then. I kind of want to send this series to a few of my teachers so they may pick up a thing or two on how to present a naturally awesome topic in NOT just a straightforward manner but rather an exciting one, worthy of topic itself. To easily express the wonder of our planet with feeling and care will automatically attract any attention from those who normally find the topic uninterested.
I loved it. My brain sucked up everything. Well worth the watch. A+",1361491200,,1027,4.743016759776537
2661920,4,B000ION2E4,Liked the presentation. Don't necessarily agree with all the theories but still gives a lot of insight into the current geographical scenario.,1355184000,,142,5.5
2661921,1,B000ION2E4,"As a homeschooling parent, I'm always on the lookout for engaging documentaries to supplement our reading and field trips. I have fond childhood memories of watching National Geographic on Sunday evenings and was especially excited to show the kiddos some amazing footage of Kilauea or Mauna Loa -- our PacNW volcanoes are a completely different variety and hey, who doesn't love lava?

Alas, not with these videos. We didn't make it past ~5 minutes. A horrid mishmosh of stock footage and dated animation flew across the screen at a dizzying rate. The drunken, one-sided arguments my mentally ill neighbor has with himself at 2am have more depth than the writing in this film. The narrator's diction was so completely outrageous that I actually considered whether I had been duped by a parody.

I'm shocked at the glowing reviews of this series by people who claim to be educators of middle school and high school kids... really? My 9 year old was skeptical within the first minute and asked that we turn it off by the time the narrator described geological processes as ""belching, spitting and passing gas"". Engaging  mindless fluff!",1352678400,2,1135,4.963157894736842
2661922,5,B000ION2E4,I love this DVD set!  My 7th grade science classes love it too!  If you've ever had to keep a group of 35 middle schoolers on task and interested in learning you'll understand that anything I can find to help with that is a little gem.  This DVD set is just the ticket!  I get a kick out of some of the other reviewers who complain about this DVD set - honestly . . . relax and take the DVD's for what they are - great entertainment and a fabulous way to learn about the Earth!,1352592000,2,477,3.9375
2661923,1,B000ION2E4,"Flying rapidly through multiple locations with poor narration, this series was of poor quality for teaching a coherent modern approach to scientific education/entertainment.  The incredible visuals were hindered by incredibly rapid transitions, narration trying to use mild curse words and weak thoughtless descriptions, and music that does not fit the message.  I don't mind some cursing, just have a point with it!  It is a presentation gone terribly wrong....disappointing!",1352073600,,476,5.869565217391305
2661924,1,B000ION2E4,"Loud music, thriller narration instead of documentary narration, more loud music which makes it hard to hear the awful narrator, and all animation... The pictures that you see on the cover have nothing to do with this documentary since this is animation not nature. Both the producer and the director must have been on a very strong cool aid on this documentary... worthless.",1337299200,4,375,4.968253968253968
2661925,4,B000ION2E4,"NGO's first in the series, Amazing Planet: Born of Fire, is a good show for those who have been removed from the subject matter for some time and are feeling the desire for refresher material in video form. The show is not entirely up to the NGO old standards in at least several ways, for example the video quality is not 1080p or Blu-ray and the videography a little lacking sometimes, and the narration is a bit threatening and ominous; rightfully so perhaps, but maybe a little levity might improve things.

Looking at the production from a novice perspective, Born of Fire is a documentary that is believable, concise, and informative. For those who enjoy a refresher on the realities of humankind's vulnerabilities here on the blue planet, this first documentary reminds me of some long dimmed science lessons that were given new understanding and believability via enhanced satellite images of the so called ring of fire and an enlightened perspective on what plate tectonics is really about.",1332979200,,999,4.946428571428571
2661926,2,B000ION2E4,"The narrator is a well known actress who shouldn't have stooped to such blatent hysteria-mongering and pandering.  I thought this would have the class and educational value of some of the similarly titled documentaries.  Instead, I spent so much time sifting through the overblown language, immature metaphors and doom and gloom cliches, that I didn't take away anything beyond a refresher of few small facts I probably learned in elementary school.  Felt more like the trailer to a Giant Killer Wave summer blockbuster than anything else.  Can I have this hour of my life back please?",1332633600,,585,5.0625

2661928,2,B000ION2E4,"The narration sounds like they're trying to turn a documentary into a Jr. High level action movie. Got about 3min in, and gave up when I learned that our planet has indigestion, is belching, spitting & passing gas ;) Sorry",1330560000,,222,4.575
2661929,1,B000ION2E4,"The clips are way too short, and feels rushed. Not only that, as others have mentioned, the narration was horrendous. It was as if a script was originally produced, and some editor decided to go to a thesaurus and stick in random adjectives that add no value to the film. And was this the narration's first read through? It sure seemed like it.

Save yourself a bit of time and don't watch this. Unless you don't have anything to do.",1330214400,2,433,4.4125

2661932,5,B000ION2E4,Loved the 1st episode. Just great! I did not have a major issue with the narration as seen in some reviews. Nat Geo produced a very good documentary here.,1327276800,5,154,4.344827586206897
2661933,1,B000ION2E4,Watched about 10 mins and turned it off. I cant stand the narrator and the narration. It seems like they over did things to catch your attention like US media uses word play. I rather watch a straight up documentary that tells me directly about facts than this crap.,1327017600,,266,4.448979591836735
2661934,2,B000ION2E4,"The content was good, but like other reviewers mentioned, the narration is ridiculous. There was also a lot of repetition, and some pretty outlandish statements. There were a few good moments of lava/water explosions. So if you're really bored with nothing else to do, meh, give it a watch I guess.",1326672000,,298,4.862745098039215
2661935,1,B000ION2E4,"I would really love to watch this series, but literally couldn't keep it on, due to the absolutely terrible music playing in the background.

2661956,2,B000ION2E4,"The excellent footage in this program is, sadly, presented with unbearable narration. It seems to be an attempt to make a nature show exciting, but instead... comes off with the personality of a second rate magician trying to sell up a bad act. The script really reminds me of the character ""Gob"" in the short run series ""Arrested Development."" I've got to say, I'm disappointed with National Geographic for this one, it sure did have promise.  Note: My review is based solely on the first episode, as I could not stand to watch any more.",1325980800,,538,4.663157894736842

2661958,4,B000ION2E4,"This review is directed at you eggheads who gave this one or two stars:

OK, it's a given that well-educated and informed folks will find this presentation beneath them, much too popularist and Disney-esque, with little depth or explanation in detail.

However, they ignore that the majority of Americans don't believe in evolution and the earth is 4.6 billion years old. We are one of the most science-ignorant nations in the developed world. Whether it's bad science education in public schools, or the inexplicable influence of ranting, deluded young-earth-creationists, take your choice.

At least this film sticks to the facts that science presents as the creation and history of our planet. If this simple, well-illustrated production can gain a foothold in reducing the ignorance of the American masses, then I say more power to it. If it popularizes the geological processes that would otherwise be regarded as irrelevant or boring, then it can only be a good thing. You geeks may fashionably diss it, but I enjoyed it, and am glad that presentations of scientific information is not limited to what you would find acceptable and interesting (which I am sure the man in the street would find incomprehensible).",1325635200,2,1218,5.110552763819095
2661959,1,B000ION2E4,Unforgivably atrocious writing and narration have turned a potentially excellent documentary into sensationalist pablum.  I barely managed to sit through the first episode.  I can only hope that there's an alternate sound track version available (a la the Planet Earth series.),1325030400,5,277,5.7317073170731705

Well, I got some nifty imagery along with constant reminders of how unstable certain areas of the earth are, and how doomed we are if the planet hiccups. Thanks bunches.",1324944000,6,243,4.304347826086956
2661961,1,B000ION2E4,"HOPEFULLY, National Geographic is reading this for they seriously need to wake up and stop this non sense with film editing that looks like someone addicted to Heroine got a hold of.  ITS A NATURE DOCUMENTARY, not a skateboarders documentary - let people's eyes focus on the one last thing that is natural to us...the planet.

Recommendations, watch most of what BBC is doing for nature documentaries.  (like the 'Planet Earth' series or 'Yellowstone HD').  Those videos have nice easy panning, articulate narration, useful information, and the series allows you to enjoy earth as it is.

I ended my subscriptions to National Geographic Magazine on the basis of how POORLY their documentaries (nature and animal coverage) have become.  Its ""rock n roll"" meets ""drugs in the film editing room"" meets ""nature""....ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!",1324425600,2,835,5.287878787878788

2661964,2,B000ION2E4,"Spectacular footage and interesting information. However, it is almost ruined by the melodramatic, fatalistic narration. Depicting the earth as something with ""weapons and bombs"" loaded and ready (volcanoes) marching us all to our demise. Perhaps the creators felt that earth on its own is not exciting enough so they needed to add Hollywood drama but for us, it caused us to turn the program off after a while.",1322956800,6,411,5.0588235294117645
2661965,4,B000ION2E4,"I'll say this film is, overall, a well-made documentary. I liked the way the information is structured throughout the film, it follows a coherent train of thought. It carefully presents facts that are meant to prompt questions in the minds of the audience (given there are inquiring minds that watch this)and then offers gratifying explanations and visuals. I liked the comprehensiveness, the information is presented from a bigger-picture standpoint. I also didn't mind the narration style, I think it goes well with the scale of the described geological events. I believe those reviewers who thought the narration was way too dramatic missed the whole point. This isn't cathaclysmic fiction, like some dumb Hollywood movies, but instead this film exposes geological facts that are dramatic themselves, regardless of the narration's style. You have to realize there are some extreme geological forces that continuously shape our planet, even as we speak, and that every now and then they brutally reshape everything on Earth including life itself. In other words every now and then huge natural disasters do happen that could kill all people on Earth, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Now that's pretty dramatic within itself, isn't it? Some of these extreme geological events wiped out most of the life on Earth several times in history, but also, these same geological forces, might have created the rare and extreme conditions for life to be created in the first place. What can be more dramatic than witnessing the manifesting forces that both create and destroy all life on Earth, at their will?",1322697600,,1613,5.136882129277566

2661977,3,B000ION2E4,"National Geographic is targeting the average, scientifically uneducated with this show. Routine viewers of deeper, more informative documentaries will probably want to pass on this one. This is entry level popularization of science; its effort isn't spent on trying to inform the viewer, but rather to make them marvel at the natural world in general. They slip in the science when they can, trying to keep the viewer enthralled with ostentatious narration and (dodgy) CG.

I liked the first two episodes for what they were, and would suggest it to someone that has only a passing interest and education in science. A person that's not quite ready to read Carl Sagan, but would pay attention to a scientific documentary long enough to absorb some useful information.

It's so frustrating, all these amazing shots but not one is one screen for more than 2 seconds before it fast cuts to another. What happened to watching a gently unfolding natural drama?

However, being a middle school science teacher, I have found that ""Amazing Planet"" as an addition to my lesson plans on plate tectonics seriously engages my 6th grade students, who are mesmerized by the images and dramatic tone of the narrator.  Since the film at times plays more like a suspense film than a ""quiet"" documentary, it is a welcome form of media, as I find myself competing for the children's attention (as we all know, many lives unfortunately revolve around loud Ipods, raucous YouTube clips, action-packed computer games, and edge-of-your-seat movies).

2662000,1,B000ION2E4,"Sigh, I just bought this DVD and threw it away after few painstaking moments of watching it...I have to ask - who can watch this video?? I am adult, and I am European, and I can safely say this is not for anybody in my 'category'.

First, the narrator voice is absolutely idiotic. She is whispering everything and describes everything as 'amazing', 'awesome', or something like that.

Secondly, the soundtrack is just retarded. It is for an action movie - not for a nature documentary. Gimme a break.

Go and buy a BBC documentary instead. They have brains and some good taste.",1246579200,2,577,4.637254901960785
2662001,5,B000ION2E4,"This documentary is informative. The many CGIs help a lot in understanding the geological concept featured.

What make this documentary stand out from its peers is its presentation. The narration, accompanying soundtrack, CGIs and great scenery are very captivating to me. The episodes progress at a high tempo pace, in sync with the exciting geological concept featured.",1234742400,3,371,5.508771929824562
2662002,3,B000ION2E4,"The subject matter is very interesting, and most of the video clips are great in terms of resolution.  With four programs, this is a good value.  The dialogue is OK, nothing great here.  The weak points are the short choppy clips (If 400 video clips are good, are 1000 clips in the same time period better?), and the incessant, irrelevant rock and roll percussion music in the background that seems to drive a furious pace throughout many parts of this production.  You just can't relax and think about what you are seeing, as it flies by in impressionistic fervor.  I don't think the human eyes and brain are really meant for this kind of sensory challenge or bombardment!  I do like the parallax effect of a moving landscape view, as long as it is smooth (not jerky or spasmodic, as it often is here!).  There is also some repetition.  It's good that the animations and video (apart from production) are relatively high quality.  I think this ""new"" style of educational documentary is driven by the sensibilities of the people who think that it is an accomplishment to cram a short story into a 15 second Super Bowl commercial.  If you took the original, uncut video, re-wrote and upgraded the script with contributions from some knowledgable geologists, and replaced the music soundtrack with a more thoughtful audio experience that contributed to the viewing, you could have a very nice four to six hour series here.  The commercial transitions should also be reworked, and each program in the DVD production should be set forth as a full 60 minutes.  The theme?  I don't know.  Maybe it is that ""the Earth is full of changing or destructive forces, and hopefully our species can escape to another planet before something terrible happens here.""  Wishful thinking, but certainly consistent with our current, non-sustainable lifestyle!  Rethink the message if you rewrite it!",1229990400,3,1878,4.8955696202531644

2662004,1,B000ION2E4,"I love national geographic, but this DVD was very disappointing.  Part of it looked like a powerpoint presentaion with the same video animations repeating itself through the episodes.  Not worth the money.",1200268800,6,205,5.375
2662005,3,B000ION2E4,"I bought this DVD after VERY careful research.  My children had video cassettes when they were little of a program called Amazing Planet by National Geographic that had 4 aliens flying around the planet on missions.  I enjoyed the shows as much as my children and when I saw that I could purchase multiple shows on one DVD, I did.  This DVD clearly stated in the description ""starring Pat Cashman"" who was the ""Captain"" on the show. However, I was more than disappointed when I discovered this DVD was not the one I had wanted.  If you're looking for the children's program ""Amazing Planet,"" this isn't it.  Regardless, this was a great program even though it was not what I was looking for.
Whomever is responsible for the mistake in the credits ought to correct it.",1198972800,6,767,4.610294117647059

8147143,1,B000ION2E4,"Clearly written by males who think science communication for adolescents needs to be fierce and violent like a Steven Segal action movie. Maybe to a small segment that kind of immaturity is gripping; to most science-minded youth, I think this will come across as pandering to their basest instincts for violence, which will be a turn off. For younger kids, this might actually scare them and make them think the Earth is going to kill them at any moment (just watch the opening and you'll see what I mean). As a scientist who loves geology, I think this is more likely to make kids fearful of and put off by Earth Sciences than interested in it.

There must be something better out there. I know I'll be shopping around for it.",1471737600,,727,4.549618320610687
