5772876,5,B00D3T9WS6,"Having had great concern about our foreign trade practices since the days of Ross Perot, and having debated the pros and cons of free trade with friends who beat me severely about the brain for even suggesting that free trade is bad, this documentary hits the nail on the head as to why it is bad.  The transnational corporations and their bought politicians are driving this country into the ground by shipping the jobs and factories out of the country and if something isn't done soon, the U.S. will become a third rate country, and the middle class might disappear.  The video points out that 57,000 companies have left the U.S. because of the cheap overseas labor.  The trade deficit is draining us.  China's currency manipulation rigs the game so that only they can win.  The people we have elected to office are doing nothing to stop this travesty.  Another bad trade deal with the Pacific rim countries is about to be fast-tracked.  Navarro and his team deserve to be commended for raising public awareness of this terrible problem.",1384905600,7,1039,4.770949720670391

5772886,5,B00D3T9WS6,One of the best documentaries that clearly depicts how China policies are clearly effecting America's manufacturing base.  A serious and thought provoking engagement from one of America's leading economist.,1387324800,6,206,6.103448275862069

8589182,5,B00D3T9WS6,"I highly recommend others to read this book.  It will help to understand what is happening to our economy and why.  Unfortunately, we are quick to blame China for all our woes but the blame also needs to be pinned to greedy American corporations.  We did this to ourselves as fish greedily gobble bait.  Perhaps this should be a book included in all high schools' agendas to enlighten students to not ever allow this to happen again.  This is a fabulous ""eye opener"".",1468800000,2,467,4.578313253012048

This explains for everyone including us simpletons the who, what & why's of what happened in the death of our country's manufacturing under the Clinton administration.  It provides clarity on how we were ALL sold a bill of garbage by both the Republican & Democratic parties in the 1990's under the Clinton administration.

I HIGHLY recommend this as a gift or for anyone looking for an understanding on what's happening to our country's manufacturing and just how bad it is with China.  It IS TRULY ENLIGHTENING!",1434931200,4,604,4.892156862745098
8589185,5,B00D3T9WS6,"This video takes a complicated subject and breaks it down so the average person can understand. Everyone wants low prices, but wouldn't we be better off if we had low unemployment. The Chinese cheat on a massive scale. They don't play by the rules. They pirate our intellectual property, sell us unsafe products,",1432684800,2,312,4.90566037735849

8589187,5,B00D3T9WS6,"As someone who has lost 3 jobs to companies moving out of the US it makes me feel a little better to know that someone else understands the risks and what Congress, the Courts and the Presidency has allow corporate America and its culture of immediate short term gratification and greed to do to our country.  Sadly, I think the people can protest all we want but as long as campaign funds can come from corporations we are doomed.  Hope I die quietly from old age before I see it",1427328000,2,480,4.322222222222222
