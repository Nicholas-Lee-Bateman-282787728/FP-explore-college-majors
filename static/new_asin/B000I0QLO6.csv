2650961,1,B000I0QLO6,The box cover looks beautiful and elegant. It made me think I was renting an epic movie. I was completely wrong. The picture is beautiful but the plot is boring.

The acting could not have been worse, even the big name actors looked like low-budget wannabes, the movie plods along at an excruciatingly slow, confusing pace and just does not make sense anywhere along the way. I could not see what was so great about the so-called 'witch' woman, nor any of the men that were lusting after her. After about 45 minutes of this train wreck my husband and I could not put up with anymore. Avoid this one at all costs.

2650963,1,B000I0QLO6,"This movie is confused about whether it wants to be a love story or a historical tale. The premise is great: set a tale in 18th century Quebec at the moment of the British take-over, weave in a romantic encounter between unusual characters. But it tries to do too much at once, jumping in geography and situation with little motivation. You get the feeling that cohesion was sacrificed on the alter of ambition. What could have been a great story is destroyed by an unwillingness of the filmmakers to make the necessary sacrifices of footage to make the drama come alive.",1167350400,5,571,4.663366336633663
2650964,5,B000I0QLO6,"This historic romance is a heart wrenching tear-jerker, so grab a big box of Kleenex. We travel back through a journey of two lovers during the time that Quebec is about to fall into British hands. When a priest who is secretly obsessed with Marie-Loup misleads her into thinking that her beloved Francois must leave her behind, he sets the stage for a downward spiral in the lovers' lives. As if things are not bad enough, Francois' friend betrays him and their lives are further unraveled. The story is great and the music chosen is devine and enhances the events, especially the ending.

The cover of the DVD shows epic battles being fought in the background and the description talks about a resistance movement that must take place in the novel version of this movie because you won't see it on the DVD.  This is basically a love story, cut and dried!  Is it a bad movie, don't buy it, just rent it if you like love stories but if you are expecting something in the way of the Last of the Mohichans, you will want your money back and some.

2650967,2,B000I0QLO6,"Much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going.  BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the 18th Century struggle for the control of Quebec (an all of Canada) between the British and the French with sidebars from the new America.  It has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination, but sadly in the hands of writer Pierre Billon (whose script deserves a Razzie award for worst of the season) and the scattered, unfocused, and confusing direction by Jean Beaudin this film is a dud - a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film.

Even a cast a fine actors - pairing Nomie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as Franois le Gardeur, adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona , the venerable Grard Depardieu as Le cur Thomas Blondeau, and the likes of Irne Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in period wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin, and Jason Isaacs as Gnral James Wolfe - doesn't help.  Veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters!  Cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided.

2650968,5,B000I0QLO6,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I never understood why the French in Quebec hated the English so much.  My sister lives in that area and they are so prejudice towards anyone who speaks english to the point if you were dying and asked for help in English they would ignore you and walk by.  I rarely visit anymore because they treat the English so horribly.  After seeing this movie, sadly, I understand.  What the ENGLISH from England did the french and Indians were unspeakable.  This movie portrayed such realism to that era and why english was forced upon all those who spoke and lived their native French/Indian lives.  I place those two together because they co-existed together like we should have.  The actors were spectacular and all should have won the acadamy award.  The producter and director should be dam proud of this movie.  I loved it so much that I am buying it for my library.  I only buy the cream of the crop for my collection.  Everyone should see it.  It opens up your eyes to the hatred and arrogance people feel can be capable of and how they can destroy entire civilazations who were happy and well adjusted.

2650970,4,B000I0QLO6,"""Battle of the Brave"" is a 2004 Canadian film originally titled ""New France"" since the story mainly takes place in Quebec during the closing years of France's control of the province and the French and Indian War circa 1759-63.

As other reviewers have pointed out, ""Battle of the Brave"" is not the most accurate title since it gives the impression that the film will focus on General James Wolfe victory over General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham outside Quebec City in late 1759. While this battle figures in as a brief backdrop it's not the focus. The focal point is a young peasant single mother, Marie-Loup, and her mutual passion for an aristocratic trapper, Francois. Francois seeks justice for the people of New France from the greedy and disloyal French overlords, but is ultimately forced to flee to France. A well-intentioned lie prevents Francois from taking Marie-Loup and her daughter with him, and this leads to tragedy.

As you can see, ""Battle of the Brave"" is more of a love story with a historical backdrop a la ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B00000JLWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>"" than a big battle picture like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>."" As such, it may appeal more to women than men intent on seeing an action-oriented historical picture. Which isn't to say the movie's all romance; there's drama, comedy, history and flashes of action.

Actually, the title ""Battle of the Brave"" isn't all that inaccurate; it's just that the ""battle"" is on a much smaller scale than ""Braveheart."" The battle of the brave here is in the hearts of the main characters as they make hard and sacrificial choices during a time of great political upheaval. Unfortunately the DVD cover doesn't denote this; it suggests a big battle flick with huge armies along with the statement, ""RISE. UNITE. FIGHT."", which is totally misleading. Why falsely market the product? Don't producers know bait-and-switch tactics will ultimately turn people off to the film?

I admit that the first time I saw ""Battle of the Brave"" I was somewhat disappointed because I was expecting something more along the lines of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-of-the-Mohicans/dp/B000A2WP7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last of the Mohicans</a>"" (1992). Viewing it again recently, I was fully prepared for its uniqueness and even utilized the subtitles so I could keep track of the characters and not miss any of the accented dialogue, which I recommend. As a result, I quite enjoyed the movie. I was able to follow what was going on and successfully entered the world of the characters for the next couple hours (the film runs 143 minutes). Besides, who wants another ""Last of the Mohicans""? We already have that. ""Battle of the Brave"" is totally unique and completely non-""blockbuster.""

The film has high production values (it was the most expensive film ever made in Quebec) but it has a peculiar vibe that the viewer has to get used to; the tone is more akin to a TV movie (with a huge budget) than ""Last of the Mohicans"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rob-Roy/dp/079283366X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rob Roy</a>,"" but I don't necessarily mean this in a negative sense.

With the exception of Gerard Depardieu, who plays Father Thomas, the main characters are relatively obscure French actors, but they all rise to the occasion. David La Haye as Francois is a likable and believable male protagonist. The actresses who play Marie-Loup, her daughter France, and their family friend Acoona are likewise great. I particularly appreciate Bianca Gervais as the part-native Acoona. Speaking of which, I like the respectable way the film figures in the Innu people, albeit small.

One reviewer lambasted the film as ""seethingly anti-Catholic,"" but the ending totally refutes this absurd claim. Did he even finish the film? Actually the picture is brutally honest with its depiction of people, governments and institutions - all can be corrupted and corruption comes down to the individual. Just the same, honor and integrity are rooted in the individual before anything else. Governments and all institutions are only as good or bad as the individuals from which they're comprised. Thankfully, there's a remedy to corruption: humble repentance. Confession stops prosecution and humility attracts grace, which leads to positive change, even if it's upon one's deathbed.

The ending scene is powerful in a subtle way. No matter the tragedy, beauty and positivity can arise from the ashes.

Speaking of the ending, the credits sequence features the excellent song ""Ma Nouvelle France"" by Celine Dion, sung in French.

But the story leaves a few questions (SPOILER ALERT!!): Why did Father Thomas lie to Marie-Loup about Francois' letter? Was he simply concerned about her safety in a time of political unrest or did he love her so much he selfishly couldn't bear to have her removed from his life and influence? Why does France call Francois ""Father"" (capitalized) at the very end? Why didn't Marie-Loup simply tell the truth at the trial? After all, what legitimate court would convict an 11 year-old girl who was simply defending herself from a drunken rapist (unless, of course, the court was heavily biased toward Xavier)?

The film was shot mainly in beautiful Quebec and Eastern Canada, which makes the film realistic. (Wouldn't it have been absurd to shoot it in, say, British Columbia, as was the case with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pathfinder-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000R9U3B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pathfinder (Unrated Edition)</a>""?). (Speaking of which, ""Pathfinder"" is well worth seeing. It's a great 'guy flick'; the antithesis of ""Battle of the Brave"").

2650971,5,B000I0QLO6,"I read reviews about this movie before I bought it, and wasn't sure I wanted it. Finally, I decided to buy it, and to my great surprise it turned out to be a Great Story, not known to wider public. From now on, I will treat all movie reviews with a grain of salt. If someone regards Hollywood trash as a standard, will not enjoy this movie, especially when title is so misleading. If someone is looking for war and battles will definitely be disappointed, because there is not much of it there. What this movie is about is life in New France (Quebec) before and after british invasion, with a background of wider international political events. Julia Roberts and Paul Newman are not there, but actors' performances are superb, and the story they tell is very consistent. The style of this movie reminds me of some European productions.

2650973,2,B000I0QLO6,"Hello Potential buyer,
Here is my lovely review on a historical movie...one that should either be cherished or AVOIDED altogether. I learned that lesson the hard way.

20 minutes in I see that the film seems to be a great production because Jason Isaacs and Tim Roth and the Father from MY FATHER THE HERO was involved...little did I realize how much was not even shown of these actors...firstly, if you are going to have named actors in the film...give them more than two scenes...come on that is just downright stupid and uneffective #1. #2 the unknown actors who are headlining the film...that were carrying the film had no connection to the material whatsoever and I literally was mocking them part way through the film because the dialogue sequences were poorly written. Most of the actors go out of the dialect...on top of that I wanted to shoot myself after realizing that the final moments were left hanging in the balance. I will give them kudos to the music but MUSIC does not carry a picture. The people and the director do. The other departments are there to enhance the quality.

I was thoroughly disappointed and do not recommend this film in anyones library.

PS: IT ALSO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR. Go watch LAST OF THE MOHICANS if you want to satisfy your historical taste buds.",1288483200,,1319,4.656652360515022
2650974,2,B000I0QLO6,"Inside this plodding behemoth there is a wonderfully tragic love story struggling to get out.  It is hampered by undisciplined editing, uneven direction and uninspired dialogue.  However, here are a few tips that will make the viewing experience less unpleasant:  First, throw away the cover and imagine that the title is actually ""Marie-Loup"".  The title ""Battle of the Brave"" has nothing to do with this movie.  Second, skip over all of the London scenes.  They are only there so that a few big-name actors can make cameo appearances and so that the French Canadians can mock the victorious British General Wolfe, but their inclusion in this movie makes as much sense as inserting random scenes from ""Blazing Saddles"" into ""The Magnificent Seven"".  Finally, imagine that the role of the priest, who plays a pivotal part in this tragedy, was well-written and competently portrayed.  Imagine that he is first tormented by his lust, and later tortured on his deathbed by the damage that he has caused.  (If this had been the first time I'd seen Depardieu in a movie I would have told you that he was an incompetant amateur with no chance of a real career in film.  But fortunately, I think it was the script--and the hairstylist!--that was to blame, not the actor.)  With these few changes this will seem like a four star film.",1286841600,,1326,4.823008849557522
2650975,1,B000I0QLO6,"And that's saying a lot. I'm a huge movie buff with a voracious appetite and have easily watched more than 10K movies in my lifetime. And this was amongst the very worst.

This pile actually makes Oxygen flicks Oscar-worthy in comparison.

Piss poor acting certainly, ham-fisted direction of course, but this was THE most abominable screenwriting I have ever heard. I'm convinced the writer was not a man, nor a woman, but a 12-year old girl. Not a joke or an exaggeration. The weepy hyper-melodramatic dialogue was akin to the desperate romanticizing of a teenager with absolutely no life experience or practical adult relationships to craft realistic drama.

Unbelievable casting. Who in their right mind would select a 40-year old woman to play the role of a 20-something? (the incredibly unfortunate choice of the grown up 'France' portrayed by the crows-feet laden Isabel Richer)

Cinematography, set design, casting, location, lighting - the list is endless. The absolute worst aspects of bad filmmaking you could possibly imagine being put into one project.

I honestly, HONESTLY, thought nothing could possibly be beneath 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' as the worst movie ever made - I was wrong. I'd watch that flop a dozen times over than see this once ever again in my lifetime.",1284249600,,1281,5.052132701421801
2650976,1,B000I0QLO6,"The only two good things about this movie were the costumes and sets. Everything else--the acting, the direction, the plot line (which wandered all over), were stinkers.  You'd think if someone went to all the trouble of making a movie with such nice sets etc, that they'd try and get the essentials right too.  Not so!  I stuck through the whole movie, but it wasn't worth it.  Unfortunately, I bought it without reading a review.  Pew!",1253664000,,437,4.697368421052632
2650977,5,B000I0QLO6,"Unlike many of the reviewers on Amazon I came to the film with no expectations and was absorbed by the dramatic quality of the actors, both the leads and the rest of the cast. The trial of the mother, particularly the testimony of the servant and her father and the heroine's facial expressions was particularly compelling and the last minute ""reveal"" at the end of the film explained the mother's confession. For a show that made some efforts to have the native Indian language portrayed without subtitles, I was quite surprised that the film was actually made in English, even though most of the cast were obviously Francophones. I suppose this was to acquire a wider distribution, but personally I was disappointed. This film seems to polarize viewers, particularly those who wanted the historic battle and other politcal machinations covered in more depth, but used as a backdrop to the personal stories of the main characters I found it appropriate.

If you like other Canadian films, which tend to be a bit more dialog-driven and less action-oriented than Hollywood fare, give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised at how well the director brings it all off...very successfully in my opinion. And to those who disliked the costumes and sets...I thought they were done extremely well and played an integral part in enhancing the drama, as did the excellent score and cinematography.",1228435200,18,1399,4.978632478632479
2650978,1,B000I0QLO6,"Do not judge this DVD by it's cover!! I bought this movie believing that it was predominantly about the Battle of Quebec and how it affected those within it's sphere. The title tells us that we will experience a ""Battle of the Brave"". The photos on the front and back let us know that we will be seeing scenes of epic battles and acts of bravery on fields of honer.  Friends let me tell you - this film is the worst movie I have ever endured! I once had to sit through a showing of Tess with mt girlfriend and that was bad enough but this thing takes the cake! The ""battle"" scenes in the whole movie have a COMBINED run time of about 5 minutes. The rest is a sappy love story of two people you realy don't care about. And it's not even a good sappy love story. The writing is terrible and direction is lacking.  If this movie was marketed as a Romance story and they downplayed the Battle aspect then it would be what it is. But they didn't - they played it up like it's some epic historical drama. My guess is that the studio knew they had a clunker and were forced to do some creative marketing to make some money off it. Well,they got mine!

2650979,1,B000I0QLO6,"Got this to help myself with the French and Indian war for visualization purposes. And I must say in all aspects it stinks. Last of the Mohicans is much much very much better when it comes to story and plot and set designs. Indeed it reminds me of GODS AND GENERALS in which the lost cause was the South's Defeat in the American Civil War except it is a better film and unlike the French Candians the South had better leaders and a great deal of style. Certainly Gods and Generals is a better bit of work in all counts. But these things are History and unfortunatley there really is not much here to work with for anyone seeking to glorify the Lost Cause of New France.  Bigot was a money grubbing crooked official He's featured here). Vaudreult was the master of State Sponsored Terrorism; he payed the native warriors to slaughter english settlers women and children and all and bring him their scalps. The average French canadian's warfare was basically back shooting and terrorism alongside the savages. Except for Montcalm and his french soldiers there really was nobody worthy of honour among them.

This thing has poor sets. Inferior acting. Inferior costuming. Little  in the way of plot or story to see. No Character.

The story, a battle of the spirit really, lacks cohesion and creates artificial drama.  It seems the makers were not clear what to focus on - the love story or the historical events. However, I found the acting of the protagonists engaging and full of heart.

2650981,2,B000I0QLO6,"Despite decades of tax incentives, in terms of international visibility the Canadian film industry still lags behind most central African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their native shores), and Nouvelle-France aka Battle of the Brave is another example of why. More than any other country, commercial Canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries' failures. On paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising. There's certainly a rich vein of untapped material in Canada's history as the French and English warred over and bought and sold the colony, though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene of characters saying ""Wolfe is dead"" or ""Nouvelle-France is no more"" before getting back to the soap operatics. But while this isn't a history lesson, it isn't a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either: there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half-dozen re-enactors and one collapsed shed. The town square that is all we ever see of Quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior, giving many scenes an old TV miniseries look, as does director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors. What you do get for your money is a simple but drawn-out Harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that Fabio doesn't turn up in the cast. It's the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall.

An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that doesn't so much unite once-warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew, this massive box-office disaster was clearly intended to be Canada's Titanic - though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film, not the ship - but turns out more like Revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes, crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds. The Montreal Mirror described it as ""so bad that one can't even find the strength to mock it."" That's rather unfair, because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below-par 80s miniseries, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps, dastardly husbands declaring ""You'll never see your handsome lover again, cuckold's honor! You'll pay for this, both of you!"" and our heroine accused of murder and - gasp! - witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter. Throw in caddish British governors, devious slaves and Celine Dion singing at the end and you've got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that Timbo Hines was aspiring to (and still managed to miss wildly) with his legendarily inept period version of War of the Worlds, albeit without the staggering technical incompetence.

Leading man David La Haye's versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film: he starts out looking like Andy Garcia, briefly adopts the Al Pacino Revolution look, flirts with the clean-shaven Tchky Karyo style before turning into a younger Ted Danson as his character ages. While his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting, in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who's lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed. He shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn't there. Billie Piper lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau's leading lady doesn't exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center-stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly Vincent Perez's corrupt and perverted Intendant Le Bigot (that really is the character's name), the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey Sebastien Huberdeau and, saddest of all, Gerard Depardieu's bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey-haired wig. It's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it. He clearly couldn't be bothered to stick around for the English dubbing sessions (or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled). Small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film's brief release.

Some brief comic relief is provided by Jason Isaacs in his default Patriot mode who overplays Wolfe of Quebec rather like an asthmatic Alf Garnett/Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton on speed while Tim Roth's William Pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who's being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off, though like Colm Meaney's Benjamin Franklin they're both in the film for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression, comic or otherwise.) The supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as the heroine's real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful Irene Jacob looking for all the world like a young Fanny Ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better.

Strange that after Atom Egoyan was pretty much ran out of the Canadian film industry on a rail for wasting public money on unprofitable films like The Sweet Hereafter, the National Film Board of Canada should pump cash into this $30m turkey. Strange but, sadly in light of the Canadian film industry's recent history, not that surprising.",1200355200,6,6086,4.928849902534113
2650982,1,B000I0QLO6,"""An epic tale of desire,courage and destiny"" says the DVD cover! ""Rise. Unite. Fight!"" DON'T BELIEVE IT and DON'T BUY IT!

I had more fun laughing at this perfectly ridiculous piece of Canadian drivel with bad script and even worse acting and direction from Jean Beaudin. The SONY-released DVD cleverly lists Canadian greats Colm Meany,Tim Roth and the revered French Gerard Depardieu at the top of the list of stars. Meany and Roth have a total of 1 minute screen time at tops in this 143 minute farce and the great Depardieu (trying to speak meaningful Quebecois-style English) is sadly stiff and laughable as a Priest who both begins and ends this tale of Quebec history that includes passion,lust,greed,betrayal and everything else that one learns in bad screenplay writing classes.

What IS wonderful about this film, and one thing only, is Patrick Doyle's soundtrack. Right off the film is filled with his beautiful music. That's all!!!!!

Fortunately,I knew Quebec history to at least have the slightest appreciation of where this film was trying to go.....but it is truly bad....I mean it,folks.....BAD!",1198972800,9,1111,5.12707182320442
2650983,5,B000I0QLO6,"I do not know what most of the other reviewers of this movie expected; it must have been an action adventure or war movie or something with car-oops, horse and buggy--chases.  I have seldom seen a movie where so many reviews are so disconnected from the actual movie.  The description on the back cover of the DVD describes it as nothing more (or less) than a romantic tale set against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War.

I watched the movie because it is told by a woman of events that happened when she was about ten years old.  Her single mother, Marie, fell in love with Francois.  He really had an almost family relationship with the nearby 'savages,' even though he was from an aristocratic family.  When he learns that the Quebecois French have sided with the British, he becomes a resistance leader.  Having to leave on the spur of the moment, he writes a letter to Marie telling her he will return to her after he goes to France to try to let them know what their troops in America are doing.  Unfortunately, France was also in a time of revolution, so nothing was done.

Unknown to Francis, Marie could not read.  So, she took the letter to her local priest.  Instead of reading the letter to her, he makes up his own words saying that Francis has left and does not want Marie to wait for him.  Was the priest's motive his lust for Marie, or his belief that Francis would be captured and killed, and he didn't want Marie hurt?  Whatever his motives, it set in motion a chain of events that ends in tragedy for all who are involved.  You'll have to watch the movie to learn what happened.  When the truth is revealed at the end of the movie, neither my wife or I expected it.  But it makes perfect sense.

This movie deserves a 5-star rating because it is one that traditional values families can both enjoy and one that provides several great examples of both valor and the wages of deceit.  The priest is a great example of how deception, even if from good motives, can spiral out of control, indeed to the point of tragedy.  Francios is willing to give up his freedom, and even his life to try to save Marie.  And Marie is an example of supreme self-sacrifice for the love of another.  Jesus said that there is no greater love than to give up one's life for another.  Yes, this is a tragedy, not a fairy-tale 'lived happily ever after' movie.  If you are looking for an action war picture, forget this one; if you are looking for a real human story with wonderful examples of honor, unselfishness, valor, and other examples of good character, this is a movie for you.  I will show it to my grandchildren for that specific purpose.

Finally, there are no offensive words and the scenes of sexuality are very discreet.",1193616000,9,2732,4.448692152917505
2650984,3,B000I0QLO6,"The exceedingly low marks garnered by this movie from fellow Amazon.com reviewers is I think based in large by their vision of what this film could have been rather than what it turned out to be. In other words it's being deducted a star or two because they expected more and were disappointed.

I also had high expectations of this movie that weren't fulfilled but be that as it may this is not a one or two star film. The production values are superior, the cast is strong and the soundtrack enjoyable. Actually the storyline was rather good as well, a little convoluted at times but it had potential. I also enjoyed the performance of Noemie Godin-Vigneau in the starring role of the ill-fated peasant girl and shamanistic healer. Marie-Loup Carignan. So what went wrong?

It's difficult to put my finger on exactly what I think went awry in this film and the best explanation I can come up with is a rather ambiguous ""it lacks soul."" It seems to me that everything else was in place for a good film but it's missing that intangible something that makes the story and characters come alive for the audience. In view of the lack for a better way to describe that missing something, I choose to call it soul.

However you want to describe it the consequences of this missing ingredient is the fact that the film lacks the ability to transport the audience into its world and engage the emotions and intellect of its viewers with the characters and events on-screen. One is left watching, all the while aware of the passing of time and the fact that they are only watching instead of participating.

My Rating: 3  Stars.",1186617600,20,1620,4.591695501730104
2650985,1,B000I0QLO6,"This is clearly an example of a movie that doesn't know what it is: a romance? an historical epic? a courtroom drama? a witch hunt? a story of starcrossed lovers? I managed to somehow endure every interminable minute of it wondering when it was going to pick up its lethargic pace and get to some sort of coherent plot. As with other reviewers here, I was simply amazed at the number of very good actors going to waste. Too, I was fooled by the DVD jacket into thinking this was really about the epic Battle of Quebec in which both commanding Generals, Montcalm of France and Wolfe of England, are killed. I think I saw five or so minutes of a British mortar battery's bombardment of the city. The rest of the story wasn't worth the money. Fortunately, I only rented it...but I still feel cheated. I wish I had read the other reviews before giving up 143 minutes of my time.",1180483200,21,874,4.401234567901234
2650986,4,B000I0QLO6,"Regarding 'Battle of the Brave', (for Francophone audiences; 'Nouvelle-France'), I fully understand the numerous comments concerning the film's lack of depicting Qubec's most decisive battle between French & English forces on the Plains of Abraham, in close proximity to the fortress stone walls of Qubec City, set during the French & Indian War in 1759.

Half way through this picture I too wondered if the epic Canadian battle, which in effect greatly contributed to forever ending France's Canadian portion of her overseas empire of 'New France', as well as her vast American geographic holdings.  The images of the great battle were depicted so quickly, due to drastic, misguided editing, which in retrospect was a major blunder, but then again, this film does have very redeeming & colourful period qualities, plus its core impassioned, adventurous essence throughout its entirety.

Saying all that, if we view this story as what I real believe was the intended depiction, a romantic drama with a few comical overtones, yet very emotional & riveting love story involving the heart and soul of French Qubec, the combination of the native Indians and the working French contrasted by the upper crust French set in the final days of the French and Indian wars, then this is a fine movie. The orchestral suite, coupled with  the concluding song.

For French speaking audiences, especially Qubec's Qubcois viewers, this climatic French love story, set during the final era of French control over the Provence of Qubec as the historical background, really has a heart felt, far greater significance since the root of this story is their own ongoing history.

This movie has a wonderful international cast, staring Nomie Godin-Vigneau as 'Marie-Loup Carignan', who was born in Hull, Qubec. David La Haye, from Montral, gets second billing as 'Franois le Gardeur' the lover of 'Marie-Loup'. Another Qubec native, Juliette Gosselin perfectly portrays the 10 year old France Carignan. The back stabbing abuser of Marie-Loup is viciously portrayed by Sbastien Huberdeau yet another rising star from Qubec.

The beautiful, dark-haired Swiss/French actress, Irne Jacob is the alluring, well kept, Anglique de Roquebrune.  Prior to 'Battle of The Brave' a few of the movies Irne Jacob's played major roles included; 'U.S. Marshals', 'Incognito', 'Londinium', 'Letter from an Unknown Woman' & 'Spy Games'.

The accomplished seasoned French actor Grard Depardieu (Chteauroux, France) plays a rather torn Catholic priest, 'Le cur Thomas Blondeau' who attempts to do the right thing, however his guidance does not always assist the realities he tries to minister to. Some of Monsieur Depardieu's more recent films include 'Bon Voyage', Ol!, 'Last Holiday', Quand j'tais chanteur, & Boudu, plus this very busy actor has no less then ten other movies in the works, due for release in late 2007 and during 2008, including 'Public Enemy #1'(Ennemi public n 1, L')as second billing 'Guido' which is the story of Jacques Mesrine, France's public enemy No. 1 during the 1970s. 'Disco' is another new movie which Grard Depardieu got the leading role as 'Franois Jackson'.

The rest of the cast is also excellent even if their parts are relatively brief such as Tim Roth as England's William Pitt able young politician and toward the conclusion of the American revolution he would serve as Prime Minister until his death in 1894. Jason Isaacs plays the stubbornly ultra-snooty British General James Wolfe, who in 'real' history dies of his wounds during the British victory on the Plains of Abraham against the very capable French commander of 'Nouvelle-France' General  & Marquis de Montcalm who also dies in the same monumental battle, which is not shown in this movie. Even Benjamin Franklin (Colm Meaney) shows up serving as the official American colonial representative to the English Crown.

The memorable, harmonious musical theme is done by noted Scottish composer Patrick Doyle, who also scored 'Gosford Park', 'Donnie Brasco','Great Expectations' & 'Carlito's Way' among other movie scores. At the conclusion of Battle of the Brave, Cline Dion's incredible moving voice sings a beautiful ending rendition of Mr. Doyle's very nice score.

Please watch this film for what it is intended to be, a throughly well casted, dramatic, romantic period piece, with little touches of humour, shown in visually splendid cinematography, coupled with extremely well done mid-1700s French, English & Canadian Indian attire, especially the stark contrasts in clothing, contingent on ones particular economic class throughout this entire movie.

The interiors of the early Canadian settlers are modest but functional houses, compared with the incredibly crme de la crme of French Canada's upper crust, and those shown in France along with British governmental & military cultured aristocracy.

Although there are some acts of war shown in this movie, the real battles are the love-hate relationships. The title does tend to mislead people.",1179792000,10,5010,5.316055625790139
2650987,1,B000I0QLO6,"That's what this film should be called. After reading the box description, I thought it was about one of Canada's greatest war time victories, Wolfe's defeat of Montcalm and the French on the Plains of Abraham on Sept. 13, 1759. While this film takes place during that time, the battle and its' historic signifigance are barely mentioned. With all the historical accuracy of a Monty Python skit, one of this countries greatest heroes, General James Wolf, is embarrasingly portrayed as a buffoon. The actual battle lasts about 5 minutes, in the over 2 hours of celluloid tedium. Instead, we have some sort of love story, taking place during the months leading up to this defining battle, and carrying on during the aftermath, when Wolfe allowed the French to ""take their pigs and go home again"".. Unfortunately, we don't end up caring for the characters, who move through their lines like wooden carvings at a tobacco store. Gerard Dippydoo, arguably the world's worst actor, is in full form proving that very assertion. If you are a fan of Tim Roth, or Colm Meany, forget it. They each have about 15 lines,  delivered in some conference room in England where the situation in Canada is being discussed. They really are irrelevant to the film. If you are looking for a bland love story of peasant people in the mid 1700's, this is for you. If you are looking for any historical perspective, get a history text.",1176681600,9,1409,4.774590163934426

8143083,4,B000I0QLO6,"I think most people got misled by the English title of the film. This is a French Canadian film with mainly French Canadian actors whose original title was New France and this should have been the English title as well.
I like a good adventure/historical flick a la Last of the Mohicans like the next guy but that's not what this movie is about. This is a love story set during the British take over of Canada and it's actually loosely based on a Quebec legend : the Corriveau Affair. La Corriveau was a Canadian woman accused of having murdered her second husband just after the British take over and, spoiler ahead, hanged just like in the film.
However, they changed a few things for the movie (like the name Corriveau being Carignan, the fact that instead of having three children she only had one and there probably never was a Francois LeGardeur among other things).
So this movie never was about the Battle of the Plains of Abraham but it's a romanticised version of the Corriveau Affair.
I do admit that those London scenes weren't necessary and altogether it's not one of the best movies I've seen but take it as a love story set in 18th
century Quebec and you might even enjoy it.

Watching it in English felt like I couldn't truly immerse myself in the story, and I wanted to hear the French language, especially because that was what the film was about! I was reluctant to watch it, because the title implied violent battle scenes, but I was drawn in by the subtlety of expression by the cast. They spoke volumes with a look or a kiss. But I kept getting confused by what was happening- and got lost in the transitions of the story. I have a fond affection for Montreal, and enjoyed the historical detail of the native language and the varied people living there at that time.

8143089,1,B000I0QLO6,"I just finished watching this movie, and I give it only one star to indicate the film's immediate effect on me.  I mean, it was absolutely one of those films with a ""from the start, down hill all the way"" plot.  The dramatic arc is a straight line-- FROM HELL TO OBLIVION!!  The lady is a 17th century widowed herbal salesgirl with a cart and a daughter.  Then there is this guy who may be a French noble, or a trapper, or some sort of plain old rich playboy type.  These two seem to live in a world populated by nothing but lying, deceitful scum bags-- which doesn't say much for the script writer's view of the Quebec population at the time (they all seemed more like the thousands of convicts dumped in to populated Australia).  Our two main characters haven't a clue, of course, and they bungle into a perpetually declining state of affairs as they commit one stupidity against themselves after another.  Here goes a taste of the unswerving gloom-n'-doom course of events:

The guy's best friend is in league with the corrupt French governor, who wants to corner and rape the heroine at a ball.  Our guy tells his ""best friend"" all about the records he has that can prove the corruption, only to have the best friend betray him to the French Governor (whose henchman, unbeknown to the hero, he was all along).  The French are planning to betray the colony by making it possible for the English to take it over.  The hero plans to go to Europe to talk to Voltaire and the French king's mistress to do something to stop the French governor's robbing the place blind and protect Quebec from the English-- but all he gets is a giggle from Voltaire and a lot of ""Why we can't, blah, blah, blah"" from the royal mistress (who, it turns out, is handling French foreign affairs for King Louis).  Before leaving, he sends a note to the heroine about where and when to meet him, but she can't read.  The lecherous priest lies to her about what the note says (the priest claims the hero asks her to forget about him), and the priest tells the hero that she said she don't wanna go nowhere . . . no more. Thus, the hero goes and has his resounding failure in Europe.  Thinking the hero is never coming back, she decides to marry the hero's ""best friend""-- a union conducted in church but made in hell which (surprise, surprise) turns out to be a disaster.  The ""best friend"" now turned husband tries to have sex with her, but she keeps getting the most humongous headache every time and they give up (needless to say, hubby is not exactly thrilled with that, and he swears to get revenge).  Hero comes back and they make a new plan to depart-- again the next day (oh, no!  Not the next day.  That's always how long it takes for everything to go wrong).  Some Black lady who dig the ""best friend""-now-husband overhears them (she claims in court to have given him poom poom doggie-style only to help him overcome the erectile dysfunction his wife's rejection had supposedly caused him to develop), and the hero is ambushed and nearly killed.  A friendly Indian (who himself had previously lost the Indian girl with whom he was falling in love to British bombardment of the town)finds the hero near death and brings him to the village to recouperate.  Meantime, the ""best friend""-turned-husband dies, presumably kicked in the head by a horse with art critic ambitions.  Nevertheless, heroine's father (who started out very corrupt) gets blamed, and she gets busted for being an accessory.  They are to be tried.  Hero comes to town and arranges through an old girlfriend to have an audience with the now British governor, but he's only interested in seeing the hero, the heroine, and the father hung.  Heroine sends her daughter away with the aunt, who is Mother Superior at the nunnery.  Everybody is found guilty and sentenced to hang, so heroine confesses to heroically get everyone else off (which I guess is what heroines do in Canada).  It turns out that the British governor's interest in this whole thing is only to have the heroine hung because the Catholic Church has promised to cooperate with British rule of Quebec if she swings-- and he figures that her death in return for Catholic Church cooperation is a good deal (which he explains with great annoyance to the hero, who is there begging and screaming for mercy and justice . . . to no avail, of course).  Heroine swings, and her daughter (now a grown woman) has come to see the lecherous priest who is on his death bed.  The lecherous priest is all upset that the heroine rejected absolution before getting her neck snapped.  Priest then expresses the ardent hope that God might have a little spot up there in Heaven next to the heroine (""little"" spot ???? . . .  the lecherous priest is played by Gerard Depardieu . . . and he is HUGE!!!), and he checks out-- girl then does the obligatory closing of his eyes.  Girl finally leaves to meet the hero all dressed up outside the convent where the priest expired, and she calls him ""Father""-- which really muddies the genetic waters, since the heroine mentioned early in the movie that her husband by whom she had the daughter was upstairs in the light blue and cloudy place.  So they walk off, and the credits roll to the sound of some nasal soft rock tune I never heard before (Canadian, I bet).

Nobody is morally any good in this story except our two doomed-from-the-start ""heroes.""  Everything they touch turns to you know what, and you start wishing they would die already to end their misery AND YOURS.  Now, if after reading my prcis (assuming, of course, that you read the whole thing) you would like to get my address so you can come over to my house to kill me for having made you read this pointless dribble, imagine how I feel after having spent 2 hrs and 23 min watching it.  And, on top of all that, the story line has left me so depressed that I just might welcome your visit and its homicidal intent.  Sorry, but I just don't think that's the sort of effect a movie should have on people who waste the time watching it.  I mean, it was one of those things which, just when you thought things couldn't get any worse . . . guess what?

P.S.  Having finally gotten all this bile out of my system, I guess I could give this horror show another star just because all the actors were in more or less relevant costumes, the set was kind of Canada-authentic, the film was in color, and the audio was audible.",1376784000,,6420,4.504745470232959
