Keeps you guessing throughout the movie yet not so confusing you can't follow it. This Canadian gem includes a 16-minute 'Making Of' featurette that gives a nice background on the genesis of the film and more insight into its story. 5-stars in my book, I loved this film. Accomplished performances by Sarah Jane Redmond and Michael Eklund and spot-on casting. The janitor was especially creepy.",1526256000,,499,5.25
8258512,4,B0015I2S0Q,"This movie was pretty good, but not at all scary, so if your looking for something to give you a scare this movie isn't for youl. Although I did like it, it's most likely a one time watch for me.",1360022400,,195,3.9
8258513,4,B0015I2S0Q,"A sadistic, eeevil, yet playful demon is busy rounding up sinners in order to judge them. Of course, said demon is out for it's own pleasure, so it tortures it's victims w/ silly games of life and death. Sarah-Jane Redmond (tv's DAVINCI'S INQUEST, MILLENNIUM) Is quite good in her role as a cop caught in the deadly creature's snare. Though it does drag at several points, THE ENTRANCE has enough mystery, suspense, and weirdness to make it watchable. Give it a shot...",1289433600,,469,4.7317073170731705
8258514,2,B0015I2S0Q,"I'm posting my opinion on this movie, and I did not care much for this at all. I will note that it is worth renting.  I thought the intensity level was excellent, but it climaxed and ended to suddently.  There are just way to many things that are left up to the viewer's imagination, and In my opinion that's what spoiled it for me.  I respect the approach in taking horror and Demon's in a more thought provoking conservative direction, but it just didn't work for me.
Nothing can and ever will top The Exorcist in horror!
If you buy this get it used $4 or less!
Happy Viewing",1218758400,2,577,4.275229357798165
8258515,4,B0015I2S0Q,"I thought this was an excellent short(er) film about demons, both within and without.  Although at times the camerawork was obviously second-rate, the overall feel of the film was very good.  The writers did an excellent job of adding the possession element without it overcoming the movie.  Very, very well written.  This made up for some of the shortcomings of the film.

The action starts with the very first scene of the guy being hunted inside a parking garage, and doesn't let up until the climax at the end.  Michael Eklund did a marvelous acting portrayal of a nervous and withdrawn drug dealer.  At times, he really carried the movie.

I would recommend this movie if you enjoy high intensity thrillers (think Momento with a sprinkle of demons.)",1213401600,4,754,4.8359375
