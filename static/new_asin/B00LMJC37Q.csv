8666658,5,B00LMJC37Q,"Want this movie SOOOOOO bad. I've looked for it for years. I saw it on TV a few times when it originally aired, but have never found it available for purchase. One of my all-time favorites. I have no idea why it disappeared the way it did, when so many others are easily available.",1460419200,3,281,4.222222222222222

8666660,4,B00LMJC37Q,"My thoughts were/ are that some sort of problem between Gary Cole and ""management"" must have occurred!  This TV movie aired several times in about a week-then disappeared!  This movie was really funny!!!  Truly reminded me of my post high school days with a ""wanna be"" rock band.  Some of the characters were too real for comfort; I really identified with this film.  I surely would like to have the chance to purchase this on DVD, or to record it from broadcast!  I didn't the first time around, and I have regretted it!  ""Studio, please make this available for me to purchase!"".",1431734400,7,580,4.627450980392157
