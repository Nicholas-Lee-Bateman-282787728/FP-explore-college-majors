8386768,5,B00318D7CG,"This documentary is a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, families and survivors of mild traumatic brain injury.  As a registered nurse, I had encountered many patients with devastating head injuries.  They required hospitalization and ongoing care and it was easy to recognize the injury.  With mild traumatic brain injury, the signs are not as obvious.  The patient may look and sound fine, yet they are struggling to interpret their new world as their brain readjusts to processing information.  This video provides insight from the perspective of the injured as well as from treatment professionals.  Mild traumatic brain injury is often a missed diagnosis, yet with early intervention and treatment outcomes can be improved.  I would encourage all health care professionals to watch this video and become familiar with the impact of this injury.",1263600000,3,862,5.43609022556391
