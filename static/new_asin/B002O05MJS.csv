8375710,5,B002O05MJS,When I was a kid in the early nineties we had a Christian Bookstore where you could rent movies several blocks from my home. Papa Was a Preacher was an all time favorite with my family and we rented it whenever we got the chance. I've searched the internet up and down for years and have not found it anywhere. I would LOVE to have this family favorite once again in my home. LOVE this story!!!!,1457913600,,395,4.2105263157894735

It is unthinkable that it is now unavailable. If you find some copies somewhere, please post it here.",1343606400,2,246,4.369565217391305
