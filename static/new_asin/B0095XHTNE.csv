5272022,3,B0095XHTNE,"A bit too confusing, a bit too much. Less is more. Some of the music was fine but most was just passable. Most performances were great some other dilettantish. All in all I'm not sorry I bought it but I don't believe I'll be watching reputedly as I do with most of my musicals.",1382140800,,277,4.148148148148148

5272025,5,B0095XHTNE,"Noah is the musical at Branson, MO. that i had not seen.  I saw ""Joseph"" and it was spectacular.  Since Noah is now playing in PA. I can't make that trip.  I have both DVDs and share them with church friends.  they are amazed at how spectacular they both are.  the ones who do not want to see the DVDs are the ones who are waiting to see the shows live.  If you can't get to Branson, or PA. order the DVDs and share them with your friends.",1353369600,4,439,3.9318181818181817

8536335,5,B0095XHTNE,"Whenever I read, hear, or even watch a Bible, sometimes I wonder how many forms it can take. The latest movie version of this story, for example, had trees living, and talking, and had the man, Noah himself, threaten to kill off any child that would be born on the ark. They even had a stowaway for crying out loud.

I don't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate that there are no talking trees in this filmed live showing of this Stage Musical, but fortunately, the idea of Noah killing newborns off, and them having a stowaway, are absent from this version of the Noah story. As far as I am concerned..., both of those moments are just too dark, and out of character for Noah.

I like how original the songs are in this. The Musical, being about 2 hours long, explains in good detail how this man and his Family built the ark, survived a flood, and made a promise that, until the end of time, he would never do that again.

Noah was a kind-hearted, and forgiving man, not a murderer. And this Stage Musical proves it.

A nine out of ten, and 4 1/2 stars out of 5 for Noah: The Musical.

...Rock the boat. ;)",1439769600,,1109,4.261904761904762
