Mi Ni (Li Xinjie) works with A Kang (Liu Ye) at a dvd-cd-vcd video store which seems to be named ""Sui Bo Zu Liu"" in Shanghai...MiNi is living with her mercenary aunt (Zhang Yingdi) while she follows in her mothers footsteps by training to be an aerial acrobat specializing in ribbon suspension...she performs well and is hired by Big Chen's (Zhang Yaoyang) company to do some performance advertising work... both Big Chen and A Kang are interested in her...A Kang is very helpful around the store deciding that a ""teacher"" has made the right choice in ""L4YER CAK3"" (Layer Cake 2004) and making a ""Madam Courier"" comment. He is so interested in people that he pickpocket's them to find out more about them, what their soul is like. He says he loses money that way as he returns all there stuff and he pays for the postage! It's going to get you in a lot of trouble someday....
