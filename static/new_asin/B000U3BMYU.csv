2916592,4,B000U3BMYU,"This 1974-75 Season of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN is when this show really hit its stride which also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch both THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN & THE BIONIC WOMAN every week on ABC and often saw Steve Austin(Lee Majors)and Jamie Sommars(Lindsay Wagner)teaming up in crossover episodes to solve big cases for their superior Oscar Goldman(Richard Anderson)and scientist Dr. Rudy Wells(Martin E. Brooks).

This 1974-1975 Season also gave us some interesting guest starring appearances like
*Jack Colvin in the ""Look Alike"" episode before his co-starring days as the nosey obsessed reporter(Jack McGee)on THE INCREDIBLE HULK

*George Gaynes in the ""Nuclear Alert"" episode before his co-starring days on POLICE ACADEMY and as Henry on PUNKY BREWSTER

*Jack Ging in ""The Midas Touch"" episode before his co-starring days as the overzealous Army nemesis(Gen. Fullbright)on THE A-TEAM

*Monte Markham in ""The Seven Million Dollar Man"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Thorpe on BAYWATCH

*Rick Hurst in ""The Midas Touch"" episode before his co-starring days as Deputy Cletus Hogg on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD from 1980-82

*Sharon Farrell in the ""Stranger in Broken Fork"" episode before her co-starring days as Flo Webster on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Robert Ito in ""The Last Kamikaze"" episode before his co-starring days on QUINCY, M.E.

*Farrah Fawcett in ""The Peeping Blonde"" episode during her co-starring days on CHARLIE'S ANGELS

*Edmund Gilbert in ""The Last Kamikaze"" episode before his co-starring days as Fenton Hardy on THE HARDY BOYS

*Paul Brinegar in the ""Taneha"" episode before his co-starring days on the detective drama MATT HOUSTON

*Former heavyweight boxer George Foreman in the ""Look Alike"" episode

*Jess Walton in the ""Taneha"" episode before her co-starring days on the short-lived soap opera CAPITOL and before her co-starring days as the sassy Jill Abbott on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Dick Van-Patten in ""The ESP Spy"" episode before his co-starring days on EIGHT IS ENOUGH

*Dana Plato in a crossover episode ""The Bionic Woman"" before her co-starring days as Kimberly Drummond on DIFFERENT STROKES as well as Lindsay Wagner's first appearance on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN as Steve's love-interest

*Bernie Hamilton in the ""Outrage in Balinderry"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Dobey on the police drama STARSKY & HUTCH",1321920000,6,2398,5.224543080939948

2916644,5,B000U3BMYU,"A favorite of mine when I was growing up. Steve Austin represented the possibilities of the future. An astronaut and test pilot, which are truly heroic professions in themselves, Steve is still a down to earth guy. Coping with memories of his horrific accident while adjusting to his powerful replacement parts takes us along a path mimicking nearly every comic book hero. Lee Majors brings out the humanity in Steve as he wonders whether the $6 Mil price tag bought the Office of Scientific Intelligence his body, soul or both. Feeling used comes with the job. Occasionally letting his guard down around civilians, they fear him just like today's comic book Mutants are feared, making Steve feel like a freak. Richard Anderson is super as Oscar Goldman, OSI Director, Steve's boss. A realistic contradiction of Patriot and Spy, Oscar plays puppeteer using Steve for critically necessary missions of National Security while painfully aware of the effects on a man he calls ""friend"".",1427068800,,982,5.067901234567901

2916701,5,B000U3BMYU,"Its about time these companies cash in on our sentimentality for these older shows.

It seems like it takes a long time for shows like this from that era (i.e. Bob Newhart Show, Love Boat) to get out on decent formats for people to purchase.

They are missing out.  This show is just too fun to pass up.  You see it referenced quite often even today.

The sound is good, though it is not full surround, it was mastered in DD 2.0. If your receiver has the ability to convert to surround, it does sound good, but it sounds OK in just plain stereo also. Picture is in original 1.33:1 ratio, so there are sidebars but it goes top to bottom fully. I had given up on this making it to DVD several years ago, and didn't notice when it came out.

Transfer is great despite the film look. 1st full 24 episode season includes the 2 part story ""The Bionic Woman"" that later became the premise for the return and the spinoff series for the character. I once owned the Universal tape that had the Bionic Woman episode on it, the only US release of any episodes from both series and it was re-edited into a feature length movie, but it appears on this set as it aired, in 2 separate parts.  If you want the re-edited version, you'll pay handsomely for it as I have seen the rare OOP tape fetch as high as $90 here on amazon, but if you have a multi-region DVD player, buy the Region 2 Second Season set as it also includes the 2 hour version as shown in the UK.",1377475200,,829,4.246835443037975

2916732,4,B000U3BMYU,"The shows are as great as I remember as a kid. Good entertainment science is not great but thats okay.

They should have invested in a military adviser. There are episodes where the plane Austin flies changes in mid-flight several times. In the episode I just watched Oscar Goldman's Carrier changes several times they are CV 61 and 64 (same class) and a carrier from the same series as the USS Midway(currently a museum in CA) as well as a straight decked carrier that was too far away for me to read the hull number. The bad guys in the episode have single shot black powder breech loading rifles.

2916750,5,B000U3BMYU,"While the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" Series had some really great episodes sprinkled throughout each of its five seasons, I, for one, lay claim to ""Season Two"" offering the most diversity and quality of episodes overall.  It really is a tour-de-force with the key roles of Steve Austin and Oscar Goldman fully fleshing out their characters and the show itself hitting its stride.  In fact, with a few exceptions, Season 2 introduces or reinforces all of the key episodic elements that the show was primarily known for in its entirety, which makes this season so special. There are just so many good episodes in this one season but I will just touch on a few of the gems here...

Season Two includes the introduction of ""The Seven Million Dollar Man"" with Monte Markham guest starring in the title role as a Bionic Adversary to Steve A.and who comes back in a later, Season 3 Episode which was not quite as good as the first episode shown here.  ""Return of the Robot Maker"" features the return of Dr. Chester Dolenz, this time creating a Robot ""Oscar"" with a strong story to complement Season One's ""Day of the Robot"".  Both the Robot and this story is an improvement over the originals in each case...  Lee Majors Wife at the time, Farrah Fawcett shows up in ""The Peeping Blonde"", complete with her Charley's Angels Hairdo in tact and this was one of three separate roles she played on the show during its run.  ""The Deadly Replay"" puts Steve Austin back in the experimental flight craft that nearly killed him the first time around so we get some closure as well as some additional story line on that aspect of the series.  There are also some episodes that showcase Steve A. in out of country scenarios such as in Ireland in ""Outrage in Balinderry"" and in the South Pacific (""The Last Kamikaze"") The last episode in the Season is another fine episode ""Steve Austin, Fugitive"", which also introduces the great character of Peggy Callahan, Oscar Goldman's Secretary, who would go on to become a semi-regular on both the SMD and Bionic Woman Series in this same role.

Speaking of ""The Bionic Woman"", Season 2 even has the two part story introducing the great Lindsay Wagner as Jaime Sommers so by now, I think you get the picture of why this series in particular contains the most of the basic elements of ""Bionic Education"" in one package.

In other words, You simply cannot go wrong with Season Two!",1357171200,37,2399,4.650118203309693

Imagine setting down to watch a 1 hour episode and finding that you have aproximately 50 minutes of actual content. It's almost like watching a full length motion picture especially by todays standard.

The Seven Million Dollar Man episode was the best one of the bunch.  Monte Markam portrayed Barney Miller (no, not the police captain from another show). A race car driver who almost died on the race track.  He proved to be stonger than Steve Austin but very much unable to handle the bionics.  I could go on for a few hours on how much this show became a part of my life.  If you like 70's sci fi, this is the best of the bunch. The Six Million Dollar Man has to be one of the best shows ever.  I don't know how this show could be updated.
