2918662,5,B000UAE7VS,"Perry Mason fans waited a long time for a DVD release of the finest courtroom drama ever to be broadcast into homes. It was entertainment that kept viewers glued to their seats, waiting for that moment when Perry would nail the killer on the witness stand and free his client. Once the first season was released it was only a matter of time until season two followed. As with the first season, it has been released in two volumes, this being the second half of season two.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered for the tough defense attorney you wanted on your side in the toughest jam. Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger was the perfectly cast guy you almost felt sorry for, as just when he was ready to gloat over his victory in court, Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer, once again defeating poor old Burger. The relationship of these four people made the mood and mystery of the often gripping conclusion fun to watch. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Erle Stanley Gardner's original creation of Perry Mason was a bit more two-fisted pulp type reading, but slowly grew into something resembling the show when it became so popular. Gardner's Perry Mason novels, begun decades before the show and continuing for decades more, are still fun to read. The same can be said of every single show in the series.

The second season cemented Perry, Della, Paul, and even Burger and Lt. Trag as weekly visitors into the homes of a large section of Americans. Like the novels, the title of every episode began with ""The Case of-"" and each one had some wonderful moments, both in and out of the courtroom. As previously stated, the second season is also split into two releases, half the season's episodes on each release, this being the second half of Mason's encore season. The full episode list for season two is as follows:

The Case of the Corresponding Corpse---The Case of the Lucky Loser---The Case of the Pint-Sized Client---The Case of the Sardonic Sergeant---The Case of the Curious Bride--The Case of the Buried Clock---The Case of the Married Moonlighter---The Case of the Jilted Jockey--- The Case of the Purple Woman---The Case of the Fancy Figures---The Case of the Perjured Parrot---The Case of the Shattered Dream---The Case of the Borrowed Brunette---The Case of the Glittering Goldfish---The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll---The Case of the Fraudulent Foto---The Case of the Romantic Rogue---The Case of the Jaded Joker---The Case of the Caretaker's Cat---The Case of the Stuttering Bishop---The Case of the Lost Last Act---The Case of the Bedeviled Doctor---The Case of the Howling Dog---The Case of the Calendar Girl--- The Case of the Petulant Partner---The Case of the Dangerous Dowager---The Case of the Deadly Toy---The Case of the Spanish Cross---The Case of the Dubious Bridegroom---The Case of the Lame Canary

It seems that almost everything on television is getting a DVD release as of late, many of little or no significance. Perry Mason was not only a terrific show, but an important part of television history, and our culture as Americans. TV didn't get any better, and only on rare occasions was it as good. Just a fantastic show, both entertaining and, today, nostalgic. A can't miss.",1194825600,50,3685,4.897435897435898
2918663,5,B000UAE7VS,"Perry Mason, the first lawyer, murder mystery, courtroom drama on TV...WOW, what a beginning for TV!  I haven't seen these shows since I was a child!  Still, each episode keeps me clued to the story.  The writing, directing, filming, acting, all components which created Perry Mason with Raymond Burr and steller cast is a must for any library! In this second season the unity of the cast becomes evident!  More, please more. The only sad and disappointing part of this series is breaking it up seasons in half and charging the same as for one!",1194220800,2,544,4.6947368421052635
2918664,5,B000UAE7VS,"For nine seasons Raymond Burr ruled the courtroom in ""Perry Mason.""  After serving for almost two decades as a ""heavy"" in Hollywood noir films, Burr was cast against type as the thoughtful, dogmatic Mason.  Burr is surrounded with a first-class supporting cast here -- Barbara Hale as faithful ""Della Street,"" William Hopper as the wise-cracking, woman chasing P.I. ""Paul Drake,"" William Talman as long-suffering D.A. ""Hamilton Burger,"" and Orson Welles favorite Ray Collins as ""Lt. Tragg.""  Along the way you'll enjoy seeing classic T-Bird's and Corvette's, girls in tight-fitting sweaters, and dozens of plot twists and turns.  In fact, you won't totally know ""who done it"" until Perry sweats a confession out of some oily character or shapely dame with about three minutes remaining -- the way crime dramas are supposed to play out.  In this set you'll catch terrific character actors Hugh Marlowe, Leo Gordon, Ken Lynch, John Agar, Mala Powers, John Anderson, Dick Foran, R.G. Armstrong, and crooner Frankie Laine.  Snap up more of ""Perry"" today!",1187913600,49,1050,5.220238095238095
2918665,5,B000UAE7VS,"Sfter getting the three previous sets, I heartily and eagerly await this arrival.  The writing is still crisp with great plots and some excellent banter.  You just know Perry is going to win, but what trick or strategy will he use to save his innocent client?  The actors whon appeared on this show made these characters their own.  As Hamilton Burger and Inspector Tragg, William Talman and Ray Collins are perfect.  It is hard to believe that Raymond Burr first wanted the role of Burger. Who better than Barbara Hale and William Hopper as Della Street and Paul Drake.  Throw in performances by some old time stars, suchas Robert Armstrong from ""King Kong"", and new up and coming stars like Barbara Eden or Angie Dickinson and you have a real slice of television history.  This is the godfather of the lawyer drama.",1187481600,11,817,4.711267605633803

2918841,5,B000UAE7VS,"In ""The Case of the Jaded Joker"" there is the TV comedian who is livid that he didn't get the show he wanted and becomes suicidal, there is a zoned man playing a melancholy piano tune, and there are scenes in a beatnik joint where the clientele sit in the dark, in blank-faced self pity, with only the feeble candles to dispel the darkness . . . .

However, there are lighter moments in other episodes.  In ""The Case of the Lost Last Act,"" Lt. Tragg enjoys himself at the expense of two suspects, when he keeps them in suspense as to which of them were to be arrested for murder.  And in ""The Case of the Deadly Toy,"" Perry asks Della to play his wife - she coyly asks: ""During business hours?!""

With so much junk on current TV, it's a pleasure to be able to acquire classic TV series' like this Perry Mason (and Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Columbo, Rockford Files and others). There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons.

2918950,4,B000UAE7VS,"A lawyer turned author, Erle Stanley Gardner began writing Perry Mason novels in the 1930's, and continued doing so for about 40 years.  Perry Mason was a most unusual attorney, proactively investigating and getting involved in open cases, and at times flirting with breaking the law.  Specializing in homicide cases, the adventures of the intrepid lawyer were first featured in movies and on radio, before Perry Mason came to television in 1957, where it then became a long running hit for CBS, and an all time classic in the criminal law genre.

The program was perfectly cast, with Raymond Burr as Perry Mason, Barbara Hale as his super loyal secretary Della Street, William Hopper as droll private investigator Paul Drake, William Talman as the combative Hamilton Burger, and Ray Collins as the determined homicide detective Lt. Tragg.

This set contains the last fifteen of the thirty episodes produced in Season Two (1958-59), on four discs.  As in the premier season, the stories are a combination of adaptations of Gardner's original novels (8), and brand new adventures written just for the series (7).  Mason's cases are usually complex, demanding the viewer's attention, if they are to follow along and perhaps figure out the solution.  Because the stories are often true to Gardner's novels, readers of the books might already know the solution ahead of time, but the generally well executed performances still make for an interesting watch.

While the quality of the stories in this set dips a little from those in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perry-Mason-Season-Two-Vol-1/dp/B000O59A52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perry Mason - Season Two, Vol. 1</a>, there are still a number of high quality episodes here.  Gardner's original stories typically have some unusual slant that makes them special.  Among the better episodes are The Case of the Calendar Girl, The Case of the Stuttering Bishop, The Case of the Howling Dog, The Case of the Deadly Toy, and The Case of the Lame Canary.  Among the best of the new adventures by other writers are The Case of the Golden Cross, The Case of the Petulant Partner, and The Case of the Lost Last Act.

The program usually followed a pattern, typically beginning with the setup and commission of the crime, followed by the investigation, and then finishing in court.  This format provided ample opportunities to feature many different settings and locations, as Perry Mason did not spend his time in an office sitting behind a desk.  He was more like a detective, often at the front line of the action, working with the help of Della and Paul to discover the truth, staying one step ahead of the police, and doing whatever it took to solve the case.  The program provided many juicy dramatic roles, for various character actors from the era.

Mason's proactive approach, and courtroom theatrics, may not have been realistic, but it certainly makes for some extremely compelling, classic television.  Over time the price of the set has come down to a more reasonable level, and it sometimes goes on sale.",1323561600,2,3100,5.180360721442886

Perry Mason is different. These stories are as fresh, original and engrossing now as they were when they were made.

2919002,5,B000UAE7VS,"I am part of a whole generation of lawyers who first decided on a life at the bar while sitting in front of a black and white television set watching Perry Mason. Perry could always outwit Hamilton Burger and countless murderers who sat in the gallery just so Mason could get the real killer to confess.

So far only two seasons of Perry Mason have made it to DVD. This set the second half of Season Two is full of episodes that well-acted, carefully plotted and thoroughly enjoyable. By 1958 most Americans knew Perry, Della Street, Paul Drake, Hamilton Burger and Arthur Tragg. But each show had several of the best character actors of the day in the cast. While sometimes the plots were based on novels by Earle Stanly Garner (for instance ""The Case of the Stuttering Bishop"") the original teleplays were faithful to Gardner's vision.

Watching these shows on DVD is a real treat. While Perry Mason was a staple on TBS and Hallmark for years, the prints were pretty worn. These episodes are bright and clear (even in B&W) and the sound is crisp.

2919018,4,B000UAE7VS,"I have purchased all four (4) DVD box sets in this new CBS-Paramount series.  Like the first three (3), this set, Season Two Vol. 2, is also mastered with great care.  I didn't break out a stopwatch to time each episode, but they certainly seemed complete (so I assume any elements cut for TV syndication have been restored in the proper sequence).  I thoroughly enjoyed watching these episodes, but I will add that I agree with comments submitted by another reviewer; the storylines in this group may not be quite as creative (and twist-filled) as in earlier shows.  But, in the end, I didn't care.  It is still vintage Perry Mason.  You still get good acting and terrific black and white photography showcasing the ""look"" of Los Angeles circa 1960.  (See my review of Season One, Vol. 2 for a more detailed description of the production values.)

When you consider the ridiculous content of network TV today (featuring programs like ""Deal Or No Deal"", ""Super-Nanny"", ""Biggest Loser"", etc.), it is a wonderful alternative to be able to ignore the mindless (and apparently CHEAP) programming from the networks, and watch material that actually has some worthwhile content and lasting value.

ATTENION CBS-PARAMOUNT product managers:  Please allocate a budget to produce a 90-minute ""Making of Perry Mason"" documentary.  With Barbara Hale's help, you could probably find some behind the scenes (and never before distributed) still photos.  Your producers could add interviews with surviving crew members, writers, character actors, etc.  There may be some unused footage.  Add a little bit about Earle Stanley Gardner-- maybe a mini-bio section on Raymond Burr, etc.  You could SELL this gem for good $$$.  C'mon, get it going!",1199577600,3,1726,5.088967971530249

just been released. Any one who likes quality and class in film or just plane
good TV will enjoy this set of Perry Mason. There is so much junk on the tube

The stories don't stand out, and the dialog in some of the episodes is flat and predictable.  Not all of the episodes in the set are like this, but enough are that I wouldn't recommend buying this set in the series, unless you're attempting to collect the full series.  To be fair, I would still take a bad Perry Mason episode over nearly anything on network TV right now.",1199404800,3,593,4.103448275862069
2919021,5,B000UAE7VS,"At last we have the final 15 episodes of the second season of Perry Mason and none too soon.

Raymond Burr is Perry Mason and his performance continues to grow to show more nuances of his character. Perhaps his best moment of this collection is when he gives a great soliloquy about ""being a man"" in ""The Case of the Spanish Cross"". William Hopper is calling his operatives as the unflappable Paul Drake, and the beautiful Barbara Hale still holds down the fort as Perry's confidential secretary, Della Street.  Their opposition remains the somehow still popular DA Hamilton Burger played with real authority by William Talman and Ray Collins as the world's oldest police Lieutenant Tragg. By this time our favorite ""fivesome"" had developed a real bond and it shows in their performances.

Each episode looks crisp and clean, although there are no extras other than on the DVD cases themselves. With the airdate for each show and Emmy wins noted for Raymond Burr & Barbara Hale for that season.

We have a few recognizable guest stars in this volume, most notably Marion ""Mrs. C"" Ross in ""The Case of the Romantic Rogue"".  And fans of John Wayne movies & Mystery Science Theater will rejoice or perhaps cringe at the sight of John Agar in ""The Case of the Caretaker's Cat"".

For those who love Perry, this is another welcome addition to your DVD collection.  Let us hope that future DVD sets come more frequently.

Tidbits:

- The relationship of Danny & Freddy in ""The Case of the Jaded Joker"" is rather interesting. We see that both of them share the same house, they descend the stairs wearing bathrobes, and Freddy doesn't answer Perry's question about their relationship which raises even more questions.

- John Agar was also known as ""Mr. Shirley Temple"" when he became her first husband.

- Elements of the plot of ""The Case of the Fraudulent Foto"" foreshadow the arrest of William Talman the following year. And isn't it interesting that ""Foto"" is intentionally misspelled.",1199232000,,1982,4.817109144542773

For those of you who have only seen this series recently on cable, the original episodes have been cut by as much as 7 minutes to fit the format for more commercials.

With the exception of a few like ""The Case of the Calendar Girl"" and ""The Case of the Petulant Partner"" they seem to lack some of the drama, suspense, and classic black and white shadowy scenes that traditionally set the mood and tension with the underlying musical background of Season One and Season Two, Volume 1. Character development is also missing in many of these shows. Still, it is Perry and Della and the rest of this incredible cast and that can't be too bad.",1197417600,3,596,4.632075471698113

I admit that the 1/2-season format is frustrating, but this seems to be becoming the norm with older series. I might be dead before all of the episodes are released. If I am still alive, they will immediately release the complete series in a box set at a lower overall price and with some nice extras, just like some other series are doing now. I'll be bitter of course, but I'll console myself with the knowledge that I didn't have to wait many years to see the early episodes. I am glad that they are using single-sided discs.

I feel it is the story lines and NOT the actors that are at fault. In the past episodes, the stories have been clean and even suspenseful! These, I feel, fall short of the traditional flow.

8212663,5,B000UAE7VS,"Perry Mason was one of the top series for nine years, from 1957 to 1966. Many of the shows based on Erle Stanley Gardner's novels are surprisingly true to those plots, of course simplified some and molded to fit the frequent formula of the TV series.

Raymond Burr was a popular choice to bring the lawyer from the best seller books to life. He originally auditioned for the part of the DA, Hamilton Burger. But when Gardner and others saw him, Gardner said, ""There's my Perry Mason!"". Burr had to lose a few dozen pounds to get the roll, as he had played a heavy in more ways than one through his previous career.

Perry Mason started back in the days where even hour long dramas cranked out better than 30 episodes a season, which is why you get each season in two volumes. There's a lot of content here, and all of it very entertaining. The TV shows are seldom as ""fair"" as the novels in terms of giving the viewer clues to solve the mystery, but there is a trick. Whoever is on the stand near the end of the show is almost always the murderer!

This volume has a few of my favorite episodes that were also novels:
The Case of the Caretaker's Cat
The Case of the Howling Dog
The Case of the Lame Canary

And in The Case of the Petulant Partner, Perry and Della are once again off on a trip together at a fun resort. This happens a few times, as in another episode they were returning on a cruise when a case started. It makes you wonder just how involved Perry and Della were. :-) In the books, Perry proposed a few times, but Della turned him down on the notion that life was much more exciting in the office than if she turned into a homemaker!
