and I wasn't disapointed it was very funny and dawn french is amazing in this as she is in the vicr of dibley she is so funny and cute :)
but definitly worth watching if you want to laugh it is extremely funny",1205712000,,269,4.0
2091633,3,B0002F6BRY,"This is well-done, pleasant entertainment, but provides no revelatory insights. Certainly, these are funny ladies worthy of recognition.

The clips are on the short side, and the documentary runs for little more than an hour. The extras are somewhat interesting extended interviews that in some cases duplicate what's in the documentary.

So, all in all, a DVD worth renting for a few chuckles, but not one most of us will want to buy for repeated viewings. By the way, almost all of the shows highlighted in this documentary are on DVD, so if you own those sets, then there's little reason to pick this up.",1099008000,48,607,4.771428571428571
2091663,3,B0002F6BRY,"If you are not familiar with British Comedy, this will work as a good primer.  If you are looking for straight entertainment not so much.",1358985600,,137,4.48
2091664,5,B0002F6BRY,This video shows the greatest women of British Comedy all on one disc. It is indeed fun to look back on some of comedies greatest moments. Good for anyone who collects British television on dvd,1358553600,,193,4.542857142857143
2091665,3,B0002F6BRY,"Not to bad . ordered both,funny ladies and funny men. kept the ladies and donated the men's.
Ladies were somewhat better. but not outstanding.",1344211200,,142,4.958333333333333
2091666,4,B0002F6BRY,"If you love these ladies in their shows, you will enjoy watching them out of character.  It's fun to see what they think needs to be part of comedy and how they approached their parts in the programs you loved so much.  There were some surprising comments but I'm not going to spoil your fun.  If you have no idea who these women are, I cannot recommend it wholeheartedly since they make references you'll be struggling to understand, having not seen their shows.  I enjoyed it as did some of my friends with whom I shared it but they were already fans of all these comedy queens.  The only complaint I have is that I hoped it would last longer.  It seemed to go by so fast and I was expecting to hear much more from some of them.",1337299200,,730,4.215827338129497
2091667,5,B0002F6BRY,"Love British comedy with our favorite series being Keeping up Appearances.  This DVD gives you a great dose of that plus covers other classic shows.  Introduced us to a couple we have not seen before which meant Amazon makes more money off of us.  In this case, no problem.",1316649600,,273,4.530612244897959
2091668,3,B0002F6BRY,"I enjoyed the clips in each of the bios
This made a good addition to my British Comedy collection of movies",1286668800,,107,4.142857142857143
2091669,5,B0002F6BRY,"The Funny Ladies has to be one of the best way to get to see your favorite actress in the their personal self, away from the the characters they play so well. In interviews talking about their roles or about other actress the this dvd. For someone living outside of England you don't see these ladies in the news or on talk show much at all. I see this as a step closer to more about the actresses. How they felt about the part they played or how see them selves in roles. It gives a more personal touch I think.

 Other reviews where saying that the Clips are short. But i really don't see that a problem. The clips showing on this dvd is to show what they are talking about to keep the viewer with the actress. Some of the clips I have the whole set from several shows. I really didn't expect to show a good chunk of an episode.

 This is a good buy as i got for 2.99. cant really go wrong their. But only one minor thing i had is they don't tell all the actress growing up Stories. But it's really no big deal to me. My main concern was the interviews and they did a good job.

 Also has Extended interviews in the special features. A plus for anyone want to know more about their Favorite Actresses. As for mine are Patricia Routleade, Mollie Sugden, and Dame Judi Dench.",1268006400,10,1275,4.1417004048583
