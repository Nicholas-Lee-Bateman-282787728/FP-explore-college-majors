2059513,5,B00023GGAI,"As a fan (though very young) of this series when it first ran, I was very afraid that the show would ""lose something"" over the years when it finally came out on DVD.  It hasn't.  It was a great show then and a great show now.  If only cop shows today featured the great humor and rapport that Soul and Glaser had together.  These guys are great actors, and their interaction and stuntwork always made the show interesting even in the context of the occasional hackneyed plot.
The second season features some terrific episodes, including ""Gillian"", where Starsky finds out Hutch's fiancee is a (gasp) hooker, and the famous John Saxon ""vampire"" episode.  I highly recommend this for fans of Starsky and Hutch, fans of '70s TV, and fans of cop shows alike.  They don't make shows like this anymore, and it's a shame.  They are just pure, well-crafted escapism.",1087257600,4,858,4.68
2059514,4,B00023GGAI,Well --were finally getting Starsky and Hutch on DVD -- the first season was brilliant --and due to the success of the movie we now see the tv box sets coming out..Love the second season --remember as a kid seeing John Saxon as a Vampire--awesome stuff.....but hoping season 3 isn't to far away --Satans Witches and Quadramania were brilliant stories --the later episode is nearly always ommited from re runs--keep your fingers crossed! Starsky and Hutch was shown late on a friday night when i was a kid(london) and have always had a soft spot for this unsurpassed cop show.,1086825600,,575,4.76
2059515,5,B00023GGAI,Just can't work out why it's taken so long to get this series on dvd.  The movie doesn't even come close for quality and style.

2059516,5,B00023GGAI,"Starsky & Hutch was the best Cop & Buddy show on TV in the 70's.

2059523,4,B00023GGAI,"I used to watch ""Starsky & Hutch"" in syndication usually on the weekends when there was not much of a selection on television in the early eighties. Now I can relive those episodes with much more clarity than I did in those days, the series was a crime drama with two likable men played by David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser. Glaser is Starsky while Soul is Hutch and their unforgettable car. They remade the series into a film with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch but the original are the best.

This series wasn't just a crime drama. There was a lighter element at times and serious sometimes. They had a great list of guest appearances like Diana Scarwid (the mentally challenged young lady raped in what should have been an award winning performance); Jeff Goldblum; Alex Rocco; Lynn Anderson playing a country music singer; Helen Martin; Lawanda Page; Lynda Carter; Joan Blondell; Suzanne Somers;  Kristy McNichol as a young delinquent in a Christmas episode; Jose Ferrer; Ed Begley Jr.; Gary Sandy; Karen Carlson (David Soul's real-life wife);Veronica Hamel; Edward James Olmos; Carl Weathers; Scatman Crothers; Rory Calhoun; Lauren Tewes; and others.

The five discs here feature all 25 episodes. Too bad, they don't include extras like bloopers, deleted and extended scenes or the background of the series. The series focuses on the friendship and professional partnership of two men; alike and different too. Starsky and Hutch are likable cops and believable as well. They are not perfect but flawed. I don't know if they were friends on the set as well but it looks like they did. You can see the mutual respect among the actors.

My only complaint besides lack of features is that Bernie Hamilton and Antonio Fargas don't have much going on as story lines. I would have loved to have seen more of them in this season.",1453075200,,1845,4.829113924050633

2059561,5,B00023GGAI,"This is an excellently put together box set.  The quality is superb.  One can see how the show is evolving and one can also see how in the ""early days"" of television, some scenes were cut and looped from season to season and episode to episode.  The original show runners never anticipated that viewers would be watching these one after another.  The scene of the Torino turning the corner followed by a big old Ford dump truck is classic.  One can see how sets, locations, etc. were ""instantly replayed"" through the Seasons.  It is an interesting look at the workings of early television production.  It is interesting to see how many young or future ""stars"" cycled through ""Starsky and Hutch"" as early parts on their resumes.  Much the same happened on ""Seinfeld"" over its eight seasons.  My Mom and Dad always watched ""Starsky and Hutch"" and I can see why.  My Mom always especially enjoyed Huggy Bear's scenes.  One can see how this show was a ""break-out hit.""  At the same time one can see that it was produced in the era before political correctness and there are lines and scenes in the series that would never even be thought about to script now.  So the series is a real education in the evolution of this genre in the history of our lives.",1407110400,,1249,4.547085201793722

2059576,3,B00023GGAI,"This 1976-77 Season of STARSKY & HUTCH proves the 1970s ABC series, in its sophomore year, both codified its earliest strengths while continuing to evolve into a sharper, wittier, and often darker show. Contributing to those improvements were the stars themselves: David Soul (who plays maverick police detective, intellectual, and health nut Ken Hutchinson) and Paul Michael Glaser (as Hutch's more impulsive, junk-food-junkie partner Dave Starsky), each of whom directed exemplary episodes in season 2.

Series creators also struck a more entertaining balance between the comic and dramatic possibilities inherent in Starsky and Hutch's bluntly honest, fraternal relationship. A number of stories placed the guys in intentionally funny undercover situations: as garish gamblers in the two-part opener ""The Las Vegas Strangler;"" entertainment directors (named Hack and Zack) on a luxury cruise ship in ""Murder at Sea;"" gigolo-like dance aficionados in the playfully-titled ""Tap Dancing Her Way Right Back into Your Hearts;"" and, most amusingly, stunt men in ""Murder on Stage 17.""

Those are all good shows, and the duo often bicker within them, to great comic effect, like an old married couple. (Soul and Glaser's commitment to their schtick as well as their more emotionally raw collaborations is truly admirable.) But it's the relentlessly tougher episodes that prove each character's mettle and demonstrates the depth of Starsky and Hutch's mutual trust. Among these is the powerful ""Gillian,"" in which Starsky discovers Hutch's classy new girlfriend is a prostitute and breaks the news to his shattered friend.

Somewhat lighter but just as revealing is ""Little Girl Lost,"" starring a young Kristy McNichol as an orphaned street urchin whom Hutch, lately in a misanthropic, anti-Christmas mood, takes into his home. Glaser's directorial debut, the harrowing ""Bloodbath,"" gives Soul a lot of room for an intensely physical and psychological performance as Hutch scurries to find his kidnapped partner. Soul returns the favor with ""Survival,"" in which Starsky desperately seeks his missing pal, trapped and slowly dying beneath a car wreck. All in all, a very good season, with (of course) Antonio Fargas still sharp as sidekick Huggy Bear.

Paul Michael Glaser, David Soul, Bernie Hamilton, Antonio Fargas. Full-speed car chases, original characters and hip humor made this cop drama a hit for all four seasons it was on the air and inspired a motion picture remake starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the Spring of 2004.

In the meantime, it's so nice to be able to watch all these episodes of STARSKY & HUTCH complete & uncut as well as commercial-free without having all those deleted scenes you get when it was on TNT, TNN, and now Cozi-TV.",1387497600,2,2753,5.305045871559633

2059589,5,B00023GGAI,"The 1970s TV cop duo is once again cleaning the boob tube (or LCD or plasma set) of crime, and it's quite the ""trip"" down memory lane.

The funky second-season theme by Tom Scott is both catchy and cheeky and complements the hilarious opening credits much better than Lalo Schifrin's grim, downbeat, first-season theme.

And hilarious the opening credits are, because, although the show is called Starsky & Hutch, the guy who plays Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and drives the flashy red and white-striped Ford Gran Torino is the second actor listed. David Soul (Hutch) gets top billing, and over a freeze frame of him yelling and flailing his arms maniacally.

Antonio Fargas, who plays nightclub-owning street informant Huggy Bear, gets special standout billing (""and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear""). But then, all of a sudden, the credits list Bernie Hamilton (the irascible but lovable Captain Dobey). That's it - just Bernie Hamilton. It's like the credits are saying, ""...and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear - oh, by the way, Bernie Hamilton.""

There's more to the show than just the hilarious opening credits and wacky main theme, and certainly much more than the insipid, shallow, and unworthy big-screen Starsky & Hutch parody starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Stiller and Wilson may be funny (not really), but they're no David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser. Soul and Glaser are solid actors with great screen chemistry, and Glaser is a better and more accomplished film and television director.

Even if you're not into TV cop shows or don't particularly care for Starsky & Hutch, at least just check out the opening credits and main theme. It's one of the more entertaining highlights of classic 1970s television.",1312588800,,1723,5.031578947368421

2059601,5,B00023GGAI,"The first season of this show was good but season 2 is excellent.  It brings us more humor, heartbreak, action, suspense, conflict, and closeness as the two cops/best friends continue to fight crime, date lovely women, get their hearts broken, get sick or injured or lost or captured, and more.

2059613,5,B00023GGAI,"This is the entire second season's worth of episodes, from a total of four seasons. With this set, you're halfway to having every episode!

 And this is arguably the best season of the entire run of the show, with the premiere season a close (very close!) second.

  The surprise hit of the '75 season, 'Starsky & Hutch' was a monster success for ABC, Spelling-Goldberg productions, the actors and everybody involved.

  When the second season rolled around, Paul Michael Glaser as 'Starsky' and David Soul as 'Hutch' had settled comfortably into thier roles, and the writing and production staff finally got around to creating some stories written specifically for this show, as opposed to the first season's episodes, which were all originally written for other shows, with the exception of only two episodes.

  The insane level of ultra-violence (by 70s-era TV standards, anyway)was still there from season one, but instead of merely being action tacked needlessly onto the story-line, it was seamlessly written into each story as an integral part of the plot. In this way, even though there was still plenty of fist-fights, car chases and gun battles, they seemed less gratuitous and therefore did not detract from the story.

  The action of this show is one of the stand-outs, and the series' stunt-coordinator Charles Picerni must be given the lion's share of the credit for making it seem so realistic and exciting. Not only was Picerni the stunt-coordinator, but he was Paul Michael Glaser's stunt-man also. The fact that he looks remarkably similar to Glaser is one reason for the great realism.

  The combination of Picerni and Gary Epper (David Soul's stunt-man through the second season)helped to create the image of 'Starsky & Hutch' being the toughest guys on the Bay City police force! Boy, Starsky sure could throw a mean kidney-punch! And Hutch's Ju-Jitsu inspired fighting style made fast work of any bad guy!

  For the sharp-eyed viewer, the 'third star' of the show went through some subtle changes beginning in season two. Starsky's beloved Ford Gran Torino, nicknamed the 'Striped Tomato' this season by Hutch, got a make-over for the new season.

  Well, not so much a make-over, as a...do-over! The first season cars (2 of them) were 1975 Gran Torinos, equipped with standard small displacement engines (351 'Windsor'). All 'high-performance' was achieved with the courtesy of film tricks and sound effects. Notably, these first-season cars were equipped with body-colored(red) 'sport' mirrors on the doors, body-colored (red) bumper-to-body panels, and full-width cloth bench seats.

 For the second season, the two 1975 Torinos were replaced with four brand new 1976 Gran Torinos, each custom painted by the production company in the famous red and white stripe scheme.

  These new cars, however displayed the minor changes that Ford made in the product line from 1975 to 1976. Instead of the red mirrors as before, these new cars had shiny chrome-plated 'luxury' mirrors on the doors. The red bumper-to-body panels were now a fleet-grey color, obvious in the episode 'The Psychic'.

  Most importantly, these cars were all ordered with the biggest, most powerful engines available from Ford, the 460 cubic inch 'Police Interceptor' engine. Don't get excited though...the realities of late-seventies emission standards did not allow any manufacturer to produce a true 'high performance' engine. Rated at just a measly 202 horsepower,these cars were not what anyone would consider 'high performance'. However, the world of TV show production does not rely on reality...it creates its own! And through sound effects, incredible stunt driving and skillful editing techniques, Starsky's bright red hot-rod was as fast and powerful as ever!

 One change the new cars had that the stars themselves didn't like were the new seats! Whereas the original cars had relatively-grippy cloth front seats, the new 1976 cars had nice black leather seats, all smooth and shiny...and slippery! Glaser and Soul, as well as the stunt drivers complained that they were sliding all over the seats as they did their 'spirited' driving scenes, so the production company switched the seats from the two original 1975 cars into two of the new 1976 cars.

 If you pay very close attention, you will notice that the front seat upholstery does not match the rear seat upholstery in several scenes. If you look really closely, you may even notice that Starsky is driving on a leather seat, only to arrive on a cloth seat.

  But in the whole scheme of things, this is all reletively meaningless. The thrust of this show is the stories, and this season doesn't dissapoint! Some of the best, most memeorable episodes came from season two, and they are all here in thier glory!

 'Bust Amboy' is the quintessential episode of 'Starsky & Hutch'. It contains a little of just about every detail that made this show awesome: A rich, 'untouchable ' bad guy that taunts our heroes as they struggle with thier own rules about how and why they can arrest him, one of the better car chases of the entire series, excellent humor derived from the drama of the scene, a couple of touching, tender moments between the guys and the bad guy's girl-toy, and several exciting and inventive fight scenes. One of my personal favorites.

 'Gillian' gives David Soul as 'Hutch' the chance to really show his acting chops again like in the first season episode 'The Fix'. Unknown to him, Hutch's girlfriend Gillian, played by Soul's then-wife Karen Carlson, is a prostitute trying to quit the business to lead a life of normalcy with Hutch, but her psychotic pimp and his ruthless mother(!) refuse to let her go. Probably the most touching and tender moment between best friends Starsky & Hutch as they fight each other to prove thier loyalty to one another. A dramatic showdown at the end of the episode is puncuated by the excellent music of 'Prigmore & Macleod'

 'The Psychic' pits the guys in a race against time to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a millionaire football-team owner. Skeptical of the none-too-willing psychic's ability at first, the guys are forced to reluctantly take advantage of his dubious abilities.

  'Tap Dancing Her Way Right Back Into Your Heart' gives Glaser and Soul a chance to stretch thier acting muscles as they go undercover in a blackmailing dance-studio sting operation...Starsky as the smoldering armenian dance-instructor 'Ramone', and Hutch as the wealthy Texas oil-man dance-student 'Charlie'.

 'Survival' pits Hutch in a potentially fatal situation as he lies trapped, near death underneath his wrecked car at the bottom of a remote canyon. As Starsky frantically looks for any clue to his missing friend's whereabouts, only 'Colonel Sonny McPherson', an institutionalised mental-patient who believes he is still fighting World War II knows where Hutch is,and Sonny belives he's a German spy! And Sonny fully intends to execute all spies to protect his country!

  And as a treat to the fans that think the 'car is the star', the final episode of season two, 'Starsky & Hutch Are Guilty' is the typical 'evil twins' episode of the show, albeit with a little more realism than in most efforts. ADA Sharon Fremont (Lauren Tewes of Love Boat fame) hires two dead-ringers for Starsky & Hutch to impersonate them and ruin thier credibilty. The episode culminates with the imposters, driving a perfect replica of Starsky's Torino, being chased all over Bay City by the real Starsky & Hutch in the real Torino. This episode was directed by the stunt coordinator Charles Picerni, and this extended-length car chase is his tour-de-force effort for the entire series. It is the best car chase of the entire series, and probably the best car chase of ANY TV series.

 There are many other excellent episodes, each one as good as the next. There are only a couple of clinkers in the whole lot, and they are only poor when compared to the rest of them.

 The theme music used for this season is the famous Tom Scott score 'Gotcha!', easily the most identified and popular theme music used on the entire series. Packed with action and excitement, but still possesing an upbeat and lighter tone, this theme perfectly captures the tone of the second season episodes.

 This collection is a must-have...so get it! Enjoy!",1111104000,12,8327,5.036496350364963
2059614,5,B00023GGAI,"Starsky and Hutch is an awsome tv show. Unlike movies, a tv show provides an opportunity to unravel the depth of its characters and this show does a top-notch job in that department. Made in the 70's, this show is still a class apart from any show today when they make extensive use of weapons and have less room for human emotions/growth in a majority of the shows.

The friendship between Starsky and Hutch as well as their constant search for truth and justice at any cost to themselves make this a very special story. They seem so much at par with each other; each of them can understand what the other is feeling. On occasions we can clearly see their struggle to control themselves when the system does not always work to protect the victims against the criminals. But they still do that and keep themselves way apart from the criminals or vigilantes. This show is an outstanding example that a cop show can be gripping and entertaining without using obscene/curse words.

The balance bewteen action, drama, and comedy is beautifully maintained thoughout the story. The interaction between the lead characters is priceless. The most important feature is that the characters remain consistent throughout the show - unlike some stories when they change the charaters so much that one starts wondering if these are the same people you loved to watch earlier.

Of course, the fabulous Huggy Bear and gruff but affectionate Captain Dobey are integeral parts of the story. Their presence, although short at times, is very refreshing.

I do have some complaints about the DVD set (not about the show itself):

(1) It does not have subtitles. I usually find it very helpful to have subtitles.
(2) It does not allow one to select scenes from any given episode - one can either run all the episodes in order or select an episode but one cannot select a specific scene from within an episode.
(3) They should have full length commentaries for some of the episodes by the creator/characters.
(4) My DVD set did not include any booklet containing a list of episodes etc. I am not sure if it is the case with all the sets or my set just missed it.

Despite the issues with the DVDs, it is a classic show worth keeping in your collection. It is Starsky and Hutch and the issues with the DVD sets weigh nothing when compared to the quality story telling :). You can never get bored with it and you may discover something new to like about it everytime you watch it. It is a masterpiece.

Please bring the season 4 on DVD soon.",1109030400,3,2516,4.615212527964206
2059615,5,B00023GGAI,I think the second season of starsky and and hutch is better than the first season. The only really weak episode in the season is the vampire episode. Some of the best episode's on here are the one when they have portect a mob informant and he gets killed by sniper and then Starsky and Hutch become suspects. It turns out there is a secret brainwashing program by either the mob or the cia or both to make abducted people hitman. I suppose it kind of plays on the belief of the assaination of JFK was done by the mob and cia. The final episode is another good one Starsky's trusted woman in the da's office ends betraying him.,1104624000,2,627,4.277310924369748

My 9 year old son is as crazy about this show as I am, and can be heard humming the theme song to himself as he goes about his business!

I don't need to repeat all the positive comments the others have made, I agree with them all!

Starsky & Hutch fans are a loyal bunch, and deserve to have Season 3 ASAP, please, or we will have to start watching reruns of Seasons 1 & 2!

2059617,5,B00023GGAI,"As I stated in my review of the first season set, some of my favorite episodes were missing, but they, as predicted, are here in season 2, YES!!!, Like the 1st season, this one continued the adventures of T.V.'s favorite cops ""Starskey & Hutch, once again Soul & Glaser brought out the best in these guys with more character developement where both characters suffer personal losses, & where they are somtimes verbaly disciplined for some of their actions by higher-ups, although some are out of their order sequence, it is not that distracting, the only real problem I have here is the episode where Starskey is  being recruited by rogue cops, not to mention a higher-up, who kill those that have eluded jail time because of the justice system's red tape, this story is taken directly out of Clint Eastwood's ""Magnum Force"" (in which Soul starred as a bad cop, by the way) & totally rips it off, another one rips off ""Dirty Harry"" as Hutch runs from pay phone to pay phone with Starskey keeping track of his movements, not that this is a bad episode, it is quite good, & one of my favorites, but you have to wonder if the producers had a beef with Eastwood, there is even a verbal reference to Eastwood's character by Starsky about the police detective in San Franciso, It would have been nice to have Eastwood make a guest appearance as Harry, but that would not have happened I'm sure, because of different studios owning the characters, another is the ""Set Up"" which is one of my favorites by the way, but leaves you with some really unanswered questions that never are justified later, the Red Torino is destroyed here, but returns in the next episode which isn't impossible seeing that a couple are killed in a car like it in the pilot, by bad guys who think it is Starsky & Hutch by mistake, which suggest that Starskey's car is one of many, not to mention the look-alikes in the last episode who are trying to discredit our heroes,  but clarifying it would have been nice, but the ""Set Up"" is a chilling episode to say the least, in terms of reality, but leaves you hanging, another is the episode where a secret government assassin's wife is killed by accident in shootout gone wrong by our heroes & how he uses his skill to take revenge on them & other cops involved is also chilling,  all in all, as with season 1, season 2 is a winner!!! & definately is a must have if you have season 1!!!!, forget season 3 & 4, season 1 & 2 are the best, & the only ones worth owning!!!!",1095984000,3,2484,4.442982456140351
2059618,5,B00023GGAI,"As a die-hard fan of ""Starsky & Hutch"", I eagerly awaited the DVD release of the second Season.

This Season showed Paul and David in prime form (characteristically and otherwise) and acheived a nice balance between comedy and drama. The chemistry, still strong as ever, is what makes this show MAGIC, and there's plenty of it here.

A nice mix of episodes..""Las Vegas Strangler""..and one that I barely remember seeing till this release, ""Little Girl Lost""..which is now among my definite favorites.

Comedic moments abound in ""Murder at Sea"", ""Tap Dancing..."", ""Long Walk Down a Short Dirt Road"" and (especially)""Murder on Stage 17"", but that isn't to say that this Season was turned into fluff. Despite First Season complaints that the show was too violent, the series still  managed to hang onto their edge with eps like, ""Vendetta"", ""Gillian"", ""Nightmare"" and ""The Psychic"", to name a few.

""Bloodbath"", directed by Paul..and ""Survival"", directed by David, both were chock-full of angst and hurt/comfort, and showed that these two talented actors could do more than just look pretty for the cameras.

..and speaking of angst, ""Gillian"" is a definite tearjerker, as is ""Starsky's Lady""; both of which nicely showcase both actors' ability to express raw, gut-wrentching emotion.

Through it all..I think it is the CHEMISTRY that makes this series fly. No other show (that I've seen) has ever had two leads so effortlessly feed off each other with the warmth, humor, compassion and genuine understanding that these two actors seemed to have. Their ""dance"" is a treasure to watch and a gift to us all.

As for the DVD, itself, I wish there were more extras, other than the typical DVD promos for other shows and Paul's promos (which were also in Season One's DVD) for each eppy.  How about an extra on bloopers?..the kind committed by the actors, themselves..and not prop failures (as mentioned in the first DVD set).  I'm sure every fan would love to see these.

Now..let's get to quality. I DO have some complaints. As has been mentioned, the quality of ""Murder at Sea"" is erratic at best, in some places. The corridor scenes are noticeably blurry..as are other scenes here and there..and there is a scene with Starsky on deck that tends to jump a bit, from what I have seen from someone else's set. I can't remember if mine jumps there, too, but most likely it does. Worse, in MY copy of the DVD, there is a scene between Gillian and Starsky that skips a few frames and cannot be remedied no matter what I do. Things like this are a major annoyance, especially ""skipped"" scenes..and between problems such as these and mis-spellings (""Dobie"", ""Starsky Slady""), it only leads me to believe that this DVD was a rush job. WHY? I'd rather it were done right than be released to coincide with that (dumb) movie.. (My apologies to those of you who liked it).

One last thing.. From what I understand, these eppies aren't even UNCUT. A source told me, in fact, that several episodes are missing some scenes, not to mention that they're not even in order.

These problems aside, the complete second Season of Starsky & Hutch is a must-have for any fan..be they an S&H fan, or a fan of 70's crime dramas, in general. But lest anyone get the wrong idea, Starsky and Hutch was UNLIKE any other 70's crime drama--it was BETTER. It defined the 70's, it defined COOL..and imo, it is still hip to this day. That makes it a CLASSIC..a classic to be enjoyed through the ages.

Can't wait for the next Season's DVD!",1093132800,23,3499,4.76198347107438
2059619,4,B00023GGAI,"Having bought and watched all of Season One, I was looking forward to getting Season Two, and working my way through the episodes.

Although I'm thrilled to be able to enjoy all of STARSKY & HUTCH from the second season, I'm a bit disappointed at the quality of the second season boxed set, especially compared with the first season. There are typos and misspellings all over the place (including, as someone noted, Captain Dobey's name!), the episodes seem to be in some random order rather than in the order in which they were aired, and there are scenes missing!

When I order a dvd set, I expect better than this. I hope Seasons Three and Four come out, eventually, but I'd rather wait a little longer for better quality than have another rush job like this.",1092700800,6,762,4.595588235294118
2059620,5,B00023GGAI,"They're back! Season two of Starsky & Hutch is loaded with more thrilling action and adventure and it definitely doesn't disappoint. There are 25 more episodes digitally remastered in this set and the picture and sound in my opinion are great. Just like season one this set contains five single sided discs and the box cover and disc artwork are really well done. In my opinion all the episodes are great, but several really stand out in the second season. ""The Las Vegas Strangler"" with (Lynda Carter) ""The Vampire"" with (John Saxon) and ""Vendetta"" with (Gary Sandy) make season two a must own for fans. This show was so popular in the 70's that the who's who of Hollywood wanted guest roles. There really isn't much in the way of bonus material in this release. A reunion feature of the cast or a where are they now segment would have been a nice addition. TV's best cop duo are back and they're tougher than ever, so accept no substitute and pick up your copy of ""Starsky and Hutch"" season two today. Zebra Three Out!

 The reception/focus on the season 2 set doesn't seem to be as good as season 1. For one thing the guys eyes seem to range from pale blue to (for Starsky) brown! What's up with that?

 The episodes (though watched religiously 29 years ago, I am old, so I don't remember most of them) seem to be much different from season 1 in that they sometimes tend to ramble.

 Overall I love the show. I love the actors. I love the fact that Columbia/TriStar has chosen S&H to come out on DVD. Now that I've watched both seasons.. I'm ready to get the other two seasons.

A definite must for anyone who grew up during that decade!  Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul are the best as Starsky & Hutch!",1090195200,,555,4.372549019607843

Please release all seasons of ""CHiPs"" as soon as possible plus the rest of the seasons of Starsky & Hutch.
Thanks.",1089936000,4,369,3.8684210526315788
2059630,5,B00023GGAI,"Starsky and Hutch was the quintessential 70s action show. The editorial reviewer got it right that the second season improved on the first in terms of darker stories and character development. Of course there are the cliches' but they handled them in unique and honest ways. The tag at the end of the episode Starsky's girl is poignant  and unusually detailed. I remember the second seasons episodes being attacked by the press as being too violent and graphic at the time. Nowadays, after shows like Miami Vice (which Glaser directed some episodes), and Hill Street Blues, the violence seems tame, but there were some attempts (unfortunatly successful) to tame the show down after season 2, and rely more on the comedic angle. Season 2 still has Huggy Bear without his bar, and that always bothered me why they took that away from his character. Season 2 also has the truly horrible spin off attempt, Turkey and the Bear, which thankfully never got picked up. Buy this DVD, you won't be dissapointed. It's great period piece drama, right before the advent of disco. I see that they are releasing this set in conjunction with the release of the movie version, so I hope they decide to release the 3rd and 4th seasons soon and not leave us hanging. Oh...and please PLEASE forget about putting out a CHiPs DVD!!!! That dreadful series was everything that S&H thankfully never became, bland, bloodless and deviod of any real emotion.",1089763200,9,1430,4.836734693877551
