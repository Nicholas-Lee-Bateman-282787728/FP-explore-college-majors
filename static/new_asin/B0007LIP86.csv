8048301,5,B0007LIP86,"This tape contains 4 great color cartoons from the golden age of cartoons, including the classic Small Fry by Max and Dave Fleischer (Superman); plus Case of the Missing Hare starring a young Bugs Bunny; Naughty But Mice, with Herman the mouse fighting a cat almost as nastily as Itchy And Scratchy on the Simpsons half a century later; and Mary's Little Lamb, a U.B. Iwerks Fairy Tale Classic. Of course the Bugs Bunny is funny, the Herman cartoon is a good example of early cartoon violence, the fairy tale and Small Fry are cute with pretty period music, and Small Fry features particularly good animation, some of the best ever.",1189641600,,632,4.702702702702703
