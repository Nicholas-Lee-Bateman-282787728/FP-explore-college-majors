8323429,1,B001NCE3T8,"I was hoping to supplement my worn Madhur Jaffrey VHS Cooking tape with this.  I should've thrown the DVD in the Wok!  The actor in this program has starred in some low budget action films that I have never heard of and has seen fit to include some previews (ugh).  This program was taped in a private kitchen with tin can sound and awful lighting.  He talks way too fast.  I couldn't even finish watching it, I donated it to the local library and they put it out in a fund drive sale for 50 cents.  There should be a half star rating or less.  A waste of production money and my money!",1241568000,,586,4.132743362831858
