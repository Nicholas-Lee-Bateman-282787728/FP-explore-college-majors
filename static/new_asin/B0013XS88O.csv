3120399,5,B0013XS88O,"Robben Ford shares his extensive knowledge about this most ignored approach to playing the guitar.  His use of this technical yet emotional playing incorporates his use of sound with the PDF charts to educate the guitarist in a very open, yet simple, approach to an improvement in our guitar playing. I would recommend this DVD to all guitarists desiring to incorporate interesting harmonies into the blues structure.",1307404800,,417,5.223880597014926
3120400,2,B0013XS88O,"Nice Video..... the supporting doc didn't always, actually not very often, track the video.  However, just watching
Ford play is always inspiring.  No real context of the extended chords within the harmony, why are these chord
useful and meaningful harmonically?  Since the supporting docs don't really support the video, it's challenging to grasp the
usage of these very nicely sounding chords within the harmonic framework of the examples.  He plays a chord
and says profoundly, hey there's a flat-5 and the 13th and wow adding the base I'm back at this chord.  Well,
for someone who has figured this out, why not translate it rather than stroll into a cool chord and say, ""Hey this
is what I'm playing"".  I listen to Robben Ford all the time and I'm picking up just the feel and approach from the
video, and its interesting and helpful.  But from trying to understand the role of chord substitutions in Blues Harmony,
it's ""well look what I found, and isn't this cool"", and good luck with the supporting docs  I would expect a more
intellectual approach, less ""me"",  and an appreciation for us  ""less than virtuoso players"" in bringing chord substitutions
to the less than Ford (maybe GM) public.  Alas, I'll try another virtuosos, one with out a, ""wow look at me"", approach.

I own robben ford's back to the blues and that touches on both soloing and chords... while this dvd mainly explains different voicings and rhythm patterns mostly about jazz and especially blues.

3120402,3,B0013XS88O,"To be honest I had not heard of Robben Ford before buying the dvd. His style is unique. In this dvd he gives an insight on how he creates. Ford demonstrates his playing technique. The price for the dvd is much cheaper than a private lesson. So what can be gained from it depends on your own guitar experince level. I consider myself an intermediate guitarist most of the dvd I grasped, but some of it was beyond me. This dvd I wouldn't recommend to a beginner. Others should consider the dvd for the experience of new knowledge from a noted blues artist, Robben Ford.",1251504000,5,567,4.40952380952381

It opens everything up for the other guys to solo over, and really makes you look/sound like a funky yet laid back rhythm player.

3120405,5,B0013XS88O,"Just got my copy today and just finished to watch it for the first time. I was a bit worried as a previous reviewer had mentioned that it contained a lot of ""Junior stuff"". That's not the case.
The teachings in this video can all be applied to club and jam session situation. Trust me, if you play the rythms in there as well or pretty close to Robben's level you won't be kicked out of any jam sessions...

I like the pace of this video. Ford spends a couple of minutes telling people how he got into music, the it is bang, bang, bang. The producers were smart enought to cut all the slack.
In a previous review I destroyed the video set of Paul Gilbert (a shredder) as there is too much goofing and almost no playing, not tab.
That's not the case here.

Also, there is 39 pages of tab that is pretty detailed and accurate. It is important because Ford is an extremely slick rythm. Many people might underestimate him as he is not as explosive as Stevie Ray or Gary Moore in their wildest moment. However, Ford would have had no stress jamming with Stevie and Gary. His rythm is obviously spot on and musical.

Also, Ford is a good teacher. You can see that he cares a lot about music and guitar. It comes across every second.

Finally, Ford uses a Les Paul and a Fender amp so he play with a very basic sound than is not that hard to imitate. I have seen many ""blues"" DVD's for either rythm or solo where the guys have either some thin heavy metal-like sound or some cosmic studio sounds that you would never hear from the blues great. One guy who is like that is Brad Carlton from True Fire. Carlton is a great studio player but he plays all his blues stuff with an ultra modern sound + he plays too clean. Sounds like Kenny G on guitar. We needs to hear some scratching here and there.

Ford shows a very, very important lesson: it is 95 % in your hands.... it is not the equipment who creates the groove.

It is a perfect fit for the intermediate guitar player that wants to have some serious grooves for jam sessions.

If you want to slow down the DVD (like I do) you can do it with Quicktime or WIndows Media. However, what I do in order to loop the whole thing is that I use AVS to transform my DVD's into a .mov (quicktime) file. THen I open it in a software called ""Transcribe!"" which allows me to loop and slow down the whole thing.

3120406,5,B0013XS88O,"I got a complimentary copy because I was fortunate enough to be there for the taping of this.  Robben is very gracious and committed to teaching what he knows. When I got the end product I was amazed how Don Mock & Co. put together such a coherent and useful workshop. Not that it wasn't before, but the editing made it even better.  I picked up alot of great ideas and I would definitely say it improved my playing. It's one I will return to over and over again.

Good camera work (one angle seems a little tiny bit fuzzy to me), clear indexing and decent sound quality. But the icing on the cake is the pdf of examples.

Top notch content, Ford is just a tremendous talent. More on the jazzy side then gut bucket blues, but many hours/days/weeks or material to learn and digest in this 86 minute video.
