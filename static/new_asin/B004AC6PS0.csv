4307002,5,B004AC6PS0,"This video is an excellent introduction to JKD, ESPECIALLY if the viewer has fallen prey to some of the (MANY) misconceptions surrounding this art. Sifu Davis goes into great detail explaining the techniques and important aspects surrounding each technique. Anyone who has done ANY real research into this art is familiar with Sifu Davis ... in fact, one could use one's familiarity with Sifu Lamar Davis, II as a ""meter"" of that Student's ability to research. Sifu Lamar Davis II has more credentials than ANY OTHER ""Second Generation"" instructor in Jeet Kune Do.

The Production values are first rate, as is the importance of the content.

AS an experienced martial artist, AND a Jeet Kune Do Practitioner, I will be the FIRST one to tell you that a DVD cannot replace ""hands on"" training with a REAL instructor, but if you are developing an interest in Bruce Lee's Fighting Method who can appreciate a very well done introduction, OR an experienced practitioner looking for solidify your foundation, THIS is the video Series for you!",1359849600,2,1036,4.948275862068965
4307003,1,B004AC6PS0,"First off I did not want to write this review as I am sure the author of the DVD is proud of his work and my intent is not to hurt his feelings.  However, the content was, well, there is no other way to say it, it was just terrible.  As soon as I put in the DVD and saw the presenter I said to myself, 'This guy is a talker.' and I was right.  The presenter stands and talks and talks... The camera-people even seem to get bored as they switch to close ups of his hands then face and then back away again to a full body shot and then move in for another close up of the presenter's hands.  Eventually a second person does come into the scene but then stands there as the presenter talks again.  They finally do some demonstration but very little and extremely basic.  I have done martial arts for 43 years and I have never seen such a drawn out basic presentation before.

On a more positive note, and based on my 43 years experience, I can tell from watching, what little he did on the DVD, that the presenter does have great speed, power and accuracy and you can tell that he has taken his training very seriously.  For a husky guy his kicks show good flexiblity, form and strength.  If only he had demonstrated more and talked less I am sure this would have been a great DVD.

For the beginner there is some information here for you but it would have been better with more demonstration and less talk.  For the advanced practitioner, sorry, I cannot recommend this DVD or the other ones in the series... I did get one the other ones and it is as slow and boring as this one.

Perhaps if the presenter makes further DVDs he will talk less and demonstrate more.  I would be open to trying his products again in the future simply because I think he has the potential to make much better DVDs than these ones based on his obvious mastery of the art.",1312761600,11,1848,4.186440677966102

8419961,5,B004AC6PS0,excellent source of information on topic.,1423353600,,41,6.0
8419962,5,B004AC6PS0,"I think the other reviewer who complained that ""this guy was a talker "" really should have listened to what he was saying.
Lamar talks about how some people debate whether trapping is useful.
I believe it is.  Any martial tool added to your toolbox is valuable.
Maybe his brief discussion about that topic was unnecessary, because if you're interested in this stuff, you've probably already decided.
Besides, his discussion is so brief that I don't feel it hurts the value of the video at all.  So I really don't understand that reviewers complaint.
This is an excellent video which explains and demonstrates proper trapping techniques.
You'd be hard pressed to find something better, and trust me, I've looked.
Great video.  I'm really glad I've added this one to my video library.",1379894400,,782,4.909090909090909
8419963,5,B004AC6PS0,The DVD goes through many various trapping actions. It is up to YOU to practice them. I look forward to more releases in the future by Sifu Lamar M Davis.,1361232000,,154,4.166666666666667
8419964,5,B004AC6PS0,"Excellent DVD by an excellent instructor.  If you want to understand the authentic mechanics, dynamics, attacks and defenses, drills, footwork, etc that form the core of Bruce Lee's fighting method, you really need to watch this DVD series.  I have trained with many of Bruce Lee's students - some of them sadly deceased now - and I can tell you from personal experience, they have great respect for the skills and knowledge of Sifu Davis!  He is the real deal, and this is the real stuff.  Straight up Bruce Lee fighting method with no filler added.  The special nuances that make Bruce Lee's approach so unique and effective are here, and yes they are explained (as if that's a bad thing, LOL !). Sifu Davis is all about perpetuating the true fighting and training methods of Bruce Lee from throughout his career - including complex Wing Chun material that, contrary to the claims of some, Bruce continued to refine, teach, and practice himself up til his death.  Sifu Davis teaches the ENTIRE Bruce Lee curriculum (and it is vast and highly sophisticated) and adds NOTHING from other arts that Bruce did not personally train extensively in.  This pure focus on authentic technique and training methods is the essence of ""Hardcore Jeet Kune Do"" - Sifu Davis' approach to training the Bruce Lee way of fighting.  This DVD series is an excellent overview.",1361145600,2,1355,4.810344827586207
8419965,5,B004AC6PS0,"This DVD was extremely helpful in learning about trapping.  I really enjoyed the in-depth explanation of how to use the techniques as well as the great camera work showing various angles.  The demonstrations were first rate.  It is obvious that Lamar Davis has mastered this art as it appears that his techniques are effortless.  I have purchased many martial arts videos in the past, but this black belt series is the most well done and technically savvy that I have seen.",1359849600,,473,4.802469135802469
8419966,5,B004AC6PS0,"This series of DVD's produced by Black Belt Magazine is an excellent resource, and who better to explains the in's and out's of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do, then Sifu Lamar Davis, who as a second-generation Jeet Kune Do practitioner, who trained under and is certified by five of Bruce Lee's students? (e.g. Steve Golden and Jerry Poteet from the Los Angeles Chinatown period, Leo Fong from the Oakland period and Patrick Strong and Joseph Cowles from the Seattle period.)

One reviewer stated that Sifu Davis is a ""talker"", and I ask, what is wrong with that? Many martial Arts DVDs too often just show and not tell. That is they show you a few moves and expect the viewer to learn the moves.

A good Martial Artist, not only shows you the moves, but explains the details, (the who, what, when, why and where). Sifu Davis does just that. He is great at explaining the details of a particular move and corrects the errors so many make in executing those moves. These DVDs are as advertised, for the ""Advanced Practitioner"", and I would recommend Sifu Davis' other DVDs he offers on his own Hardcore Jeet Kune Do website.",1359849600,5,1117,4.608040201005025
8419967,5,B004AC6PS0,I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is getting at. This series of videos is great because of the taking. Most martial arts instruction videos give you a few seconds of talking then just endlessly show techniques. I for one thank Sifu Davis for explaining in depth what is being taught. It is easier to pick up on the finer details usually lacking in instruction videos. This series is a wealth of great knowledge and I for one look forward to many more.,1359849600,3,457,4.518072289156627
8419968,5,B004AC6PS0,"If you have any interest at all in the original art of Jeet Kune Do, developed by the late Bruce Lee, then get your hands not only on this particular DVD but on EVERY DVD put out by Sifu Davis.  I own many of his DVDs and have the good fortune to have trained under him.  Trapping hands is an advanced skill and therefore there are many subtleties that must be mastered if one is to become a skilled trapper.

Don't think that you will master trapping overnight merely from watching this video.  But you will gain great insight into the skill set that is JKD trapping.  Sifu Davis doesn't sell it short, but rather spends a great deal of time sharing and demonstrating his expertise.",1359849600,3,683,4.388888888888889
