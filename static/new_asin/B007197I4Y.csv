5047116,5,B007197I4Y,"Patton Oswalt in this newest installment does not disappoint.  His unique brand of humor will have your sides splitting by the end of the video.  I personally watched this on Comedy Central this past weekend twice, I really needed a laugh.  Patton delivered.

In this special he touches on parenthood, and avoids the usual cliche jokes.  He then proceeds to his bread and butter material: religion.  He spends some time mussing what Jesus (if real) would be like on the X-Men.  He discusses how disneyland ruins 1 out of 8 kids childhoods, in order to have mentally unstable artists to hire in the future.

He finishes off his performance with a joke so funny and so...well you'll see, that I definitely can not repeat it on Amazon.  Fans of Oswalt will love this, as will lovers of stand up comedy.  A must own for any comedy enthusists library.

Remember laughing is the only thing that gets us through life, do it as much as possible.",1335052800,2,937,4.618181818181818
