NOT SUITABLE for children at all and so I am out the money I spent on it for my classroom. Not the owners fault, but really should have come with a warning.",1487808000,,258,3.980769230769231

8220674,4,B000VZGGSE,"Toddler loves this, naming all the animals. We adults like the animals, but not the ""old time"" black and white movie/additions; these are a major distraction from the otherwise interesting production.",1416873600,,200,5.483870967741935

Like Copernicus, this work doesn't present humans as the be-all to end-all of the group.  It does mention that we have the least hair and that we depend upon the hair and milk of other mammals for survival.  This work said things I didn't know.  It said 1/4 of all mammals are bats.  It said all mammals have a similar lower jaw.
I would think a work on mammals would speak almost exclusively about milk and lactation.  However, this work focused on fur more.  I could be a dummy: but I was very shocked to see marsupials included here.  Their first stages of life seem so different from ""normal"" mammals that I never expected to see them in this work.
This series is clearly meant to lure in viewers who don't care for science as an additional audience.  The narrator recalls myths from around the globe about some mammals.  Still, when they spoke of centaurs and mermaids, I thought they went too far.  There's more than enough to learn about real mammals that one doesn't need to see mythical filler.  Plus, wouldn't a mermaid not be deemed a true mammal?  (I'm thinking of how on the British ""Office"" when the characters argued over Spock being Vulcan or half-human.)
The Jungian in me was very comfortable with this work.  I see mammals and feel calm.  Insects or parasites are another story.  This work covered the living species that I find cute, or at least not horrifying.",1236816000,6,1510,4.582089552238806
