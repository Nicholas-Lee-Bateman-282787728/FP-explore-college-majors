5460480,3,B00ANJYB0S,"I love the sequence and the kriya chosen. It's very relaxing and affirming and - as others noted - my face seems more radiant after. The kriyas focus on self love, being kind with oneself, and accepting.

I have the same problem that I have with many of Maya's DVDs: she gives inspirational talks at the most inopportune moments. On this DVD it's during the singing at the beginning and the chant towards the end. It's very hard to sing/chant and listen at the same time and it's incredibly distracting from the meditation. On some of her other DVDs the talking was so distracting that I ended up writing down the kriyas and doing them by myself with a timer. It's really a shame because the sequences, mantras, and meditations she chooses are always precious and beautiful.",1398729600,3,774,4.649635036496351
5460481,5,B00ANJYB0S,"This is obviously not a workout for those looking for a physical challenge or weight loss. It's for your off days or as an add-on for a fabulous mind-body experience. I have been a huge fan of Maya's Kundalini workouts since I got her first DVD offering, ""Kundalini Yoga to Detox and Destress"" (and I really recommend that one was well.) This workout is for beauty, but-Maya being Maya-its focus is actually on self acceptance and letting go of stress and worry. If you are used to other types of yoga, this will look very different-no salutations, different pranayamas (no ujayi) and lots more chanting.

The first segment-a long sequence of raising your arms above your head, then out in front of you and back to over your head-is somewhat rigorous for your biceps and shoulders. I'd say that is the most physically intense part of the workout. You'll move on to different kriyas from there: some seated, then a standing segment, then back to the mat for a few more exercises, and then savasana. As usual, there's some chanting and some things that look goofy but feel amazing. I got giddy and was so happy that I was giggling by the end of the standing dance and chanting segment, and was therefore glad that only my dog was there to stare at me. For that reason I'd say if you are at all self-conscious, do this one alone or with a workout partner who is game at least till you are comfortable with it.

The standing portion is my favorite. I really feel the energy flowing through my arms by the end, thanks in part to a chi-gong type move. The music, composed by Maya, is above average for a workout video. Maya also has a beautiful voice and a calming, radiant presence. When you chant to yourself at the end, using Maya's voice as your inner voice, you really believe it.  I love this DVD, I hope I continue to find time to add it to my rotation.

Since some people have commented on the set, I thought I'd add that yes, Maya is on an all-white set wearing all white clothes. I am no longer distracted by it, as every Kundalini workout I've gotten has that same all-white motif. It must be a Kundalini ""thing."" Your eyes are closed for a good part of the workout, so you won't really notice it too much once you get going.",1393718400,3,2230,4.418491484184915
5460482,5,B00ANJYB0S,super relaxing. makes you feel like a little kid!! yay!! and my boyfriend would actually do this with me. HE LOVED IT.,1376870400,2,118,4.409090909090909
5460483,5,B00ANJYB0S,"If you have been longing to get those upper arms in shape, than this is the workout for you.  A very different workout than the usual from Maya Fiennes Series (Journey throught the chakras, Mantras, or Detox De-stress) in that there are many movements from a similar area.  Most of her other workouts do a great job of balancing the whole body.  This one has a lot of heart opening excersises.  If you naturally have a lot of shoulder and upper body tension this might not be the video for you.  I think the extensive excersises could exacerbate the condition.

Another added benefit is that it actually seems to make your skin glow and appear younger and more beautiful.  It must be all the detox action going on in the lymphs.  Hurrah to that!

Alas, a good workout for upper body and one I have given 5 stars as it is one of the few workouts my husband will do with me.  This would probably be a very comfortable workout for most men to do (using upperbody strength).",1374624000,18,970,4.398876404494382
5460484,4,B00ANJYB0S,"I am reviewing this DVD from memory after having done it one time, so please forgive my general thoughts and sketchy details to follow.  Perhaps I'll come back and fine tune this review in the future.  I saw some requests for more detail and will try to offer it now.

This DVD is produced by Gaiam.  As the prior reviewer noted, there are no menu selections for the individual chapters.  I believe Maya's intent is for the exercises, mantras and meditations to be followed in sequential order so that the home practitioner will reap the full benefits of this program.

This is a very white on white production.  This may bother you, but I found that my eyes were closed for most of the practice.  There were only a couple of points where the white-out effect distracted me, and that was during the standing arm circles when I couldn't tell if Maya was circling outward or inward with her arms.  At times there are double shots of Maya on the screen.  Personally I didn't find it necessary, but it wasn't all that bothersome.

The routine:
~ open with Adi Mantra (ong namo guru dev namo) - I fell in love with Maya's beautiful voice right out of the gates.

~ a long kriya, seated in easy pose, arms bent at elbows and alternatively raising each arm up at an angle while rotating the head toward the arm being raised.  There is chanting, which you are encouraged to participate in, ""I am me, I am me, thank God I'm me.""  This switches to arms out in front, palms pressed forward and circling the arms outward; then you go back to the twisting head with alternative raised arms.

~ I believe there is a brief meditation and mantra here - it escapes me at the moment.  I also recall lying on the back and Maya says ""As silly as this sounds ..."" and she instructs you to raise alternative palms to the face and kiss your palms, expressing love for yourself.  :-)

~ Back to easy pose for massaging of the eye area with the thumbs, followed by a polishing of the third eye chakra with the palm of first the right hand then the left.  I would have liked some attention to the throat chakra here, since I need some help in that department.

~ Stand for a shaking exercise to fast percussive music.  This is an on your own trance dance, you can follow Maya or do your own thing.

~ A standing sequence of four easier arm kriyas - swinging them forward and backward gently, then circling them in front of the body, then in back of the body, and then Maya seems to borrow from the school of QiGong for ""cloudy hands,"" in which you are holding an energy ball between the palms and gently twisting while floating and rotating the hands with eyes in a 1/10 closed drishti.  Maya does not mention QiGong, energy balls or cloudy hands but any fan of QiGong will recognize it.  This sequence gets quite hypnotic and my arms and hands were buzzing with energy.

~ A fast-paced mantra of Sat-a Nam, Sat-a Nam, Sat-a Nam, Sat-a Nam, Sat-a Nam WaheGuru.  The hands are held in front of the heart, in a mudra of reversed crossed fingers - knuckles out, fingertips facing the body, and thumbs and pinkies forming triangles at top and bottom.

~ Another arm pumping kriya while chanting ""I am beautiful.""

~ A short relaxation, a little twist to each side, rock up to easy pose and closing chant of SatNam three times.

Throughout Maya offers positive affirmations, such as being grateful that we are a part of the miracle of creation.  From soup to nuts, the practice was one hour long.  I have many Kundalini DVDs, particularly by Ravi and Ana, where you can pick and choose shorter sequences to fit a busy day.  I truly believe that if you can surpass the hurdle that this practice takes an hour, and focus on it instead of letting your mind keep nudging you and saying ""I need to do this, I need to do that"" (as mine did), it will deepen your Kundalini practice.

Maya is a lovely teacher; she is brimming with light of her own and truly the overabundance of white in this production, coupled with the lack of a menu, caused me to subtract one star.  Despite the benefits of doing the full practice, it is nice to be able to choose one kriya or mantra to focus on.",1371513600,17,4146,4.3905635648754915
5460485,4,B00ANJYB0S,I enjoy Maya Fiennes' videos very much.  She is very positive and gives good instruction cues.  The only thing I wish for is that the different exercises were separated by chapter so you could tailor it to the amount of time that you have available.,1367193600,3,249,4.511111111111111

8554751,4,B00ANJYB0S,"I mentally rated this workout 3 stars in its original format, and those stars were for the lovely self-love affirmations (in ENGLISH--hooray!) and the original music.  But as far as the workout itself was concerned--""What a snooze fest!"" was my initial reaction.  ""An hour-long snooze fest--who needs it?""

Then it dawned on me that the 13 tracks could easily be converted into two effective half-hour sets--and an AM/PM workout.  The last thing anyone in our contemporary world needs is more sitting, so I made Set One (Tracks 1-6) agreeably invigorating by doing Track 3's 10-minute arm kriya, which Maya does seated, as a Leslie Sansone Mix and Match Walkblaster.  The music's strong reggae-ish beat is particularly conducive to a walk routine.  Last night I did Set Two (Tracks 7-13) just before going to bed, and I fell asleep within 15 minutes of my head hitting the pillow.  Usually it takes me an hour or more!

Doing Yoga for Real Beauty my way, I'd rate it 5 stars, so I settled on 4 stars for this review.  Thank you, Maya, for a most effective sleep aid!  Whether there are any beauty results remains to be seen.",1438300800,4,1124,4.717948717948718
8554752,5,B00ANJYB0S,"This is great, vigorous yoga practice, self help and magic all in one. Working on self and projecting love to others, this program helps the individual to understand beauty and celebrate her part in the glory of creation. I have bought copies for my children, even those who don't typically practice. It's excellent, the directions clear and the music is spectacular (all of Maya Fiennes DVD  feature out of this world music.) I highly recommend Yoga for Real Beauty",1416614400,,466,4.89873417721519
