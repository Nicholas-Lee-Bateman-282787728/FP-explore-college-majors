I always feel more proud to be an American after watching our American heritage come alive again. We all need to be reminded of our past history, and its films masterfully produced, like this one that makes that all happen.

The footage and narration could never be outdone. So proud to be an American and I hope this type of film will inspire our youth as well. A great film for a class room discussion.

A hearty 'Thanks' to the producers.",1397001600,,545,4.323529411764706
