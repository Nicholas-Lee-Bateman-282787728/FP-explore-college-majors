8386780,1,B002VIBXZU,Very little info about setup or types of calls used. It is watch me shoot a cat video. Not worth the money if wanna learn anything about cat hunting. To much drama as camera shows the hunter then the cat then the hunter looking thru scope type of video. Not for those who want to learn anything about cat hunting.,1394150400,,313,4.233333333333333
8386781,4,B002VIBXZU,"Good quality hunts.
Only thing different is I wished they would to a little more training & coaching through each hunt.
For example: which calls they are useing, what time of day, & how long & loud to use each call & if one ain't working how long they would recommend useing before they switched to another call.",1393632000,,312,4.396551724137931
