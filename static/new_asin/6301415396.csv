327387,5,6301415396,"A perfect story about idealizing the days that you thought you couldn't wait to get away from.  Classic Sayles.  Great music, classic Motown and some Springsteen.  Painful, funny, real and true.  An all-time favorite.",1099267200,6,217,5.294117647058823
327388,5,6301415396,"This is one of John Sayles's earliest works that slipped by
most people.  It is set in the late 60's in New Jersey and
depicts a high school romance between an upper class brainy
beauty , Jill Rosen ( Roseanna Arquette ) and a lower class
greaser, the Sheik (Vincent Spano).  It documents an unlikely
but plausible courtship and breakup.  The performances are uniformly perceptive and it even has several Bruce
Springsteen tunes from before he became an American icon.
What struck me the most was the transition from the 1960's high school  preppy scene to the college hippie scene.  It
is the best depiction of the late 1960's college life I have
ever seen.
After their breakup,  Jill attends an elite northeastern
private woman's college and the Shiek travels to Miami  to follow his show business dream and also wash dishes in a nightclub.  Their attempted reunion at Jill's college is
sweet but poignant ; there is no future for them  together.  I would really
like to see their characters 20 years later.  I would suspect
Jill was an unhappy, divorced attorney and the Sheik was
an unhappy union official with a fat Italian wife and five
kids.  Sayles really captured that moment in young adult
life where you are totally unsure about everything.  To me , the
film is the closest thing to Splendor in the Grass.  Grab
it now on VHS  as it is not available on DVD.",1068940800,11,1368,4.618257261410788
327389,5,6301415396,"The great film director John Sayles delivers with this magnificent film. Its release date is 1983 while the setting is essentially 1960s Trenton New Jersey. Arquette tosses in one of the best acting performances you'll ever see and Spano more than holds his own in what is probably the best love story of the last twenty years.

What makes this one work is the incredibly real dialogue along with the progression of time and setting. Unlike other similar films this one is special because it charts the relatively typical high school romance into the post high school work and college world. The smallest lines in the script are truly brilliant and filled with realism. The scene where Arquette meets an old classmate in a working class bar is priceless (""We used to be in gym class together""). Later her portrayal of drunken and stoned college reminiscing is also sensational.

Sayles sprinkles some timely 60s Motown and rock n roll into the scenes and also adds in some 70s Springsteen fare that help to give the film an authentic texture. He absolutely nails the scene in which they take a weekday trip to the deserted boardwalk. Also, the depiction of the argument and conversation in her dorm is brilliant in its simplicity and reality.

Baby It's You has sort of an independent film feel to it, which isn't unusual given that Sayles made his bones with excellent works such as the Return of the Secaucus Seven and Matewan. Do not miss this one, it's definitely one of the best love stories ever produced.",1056326400,7,1511,4.759541984732825
327390,5,6301415396,"I have watched this movie several times over the years. It is a sleeper hit in my opinion-- a story of ending high school and heading for college, at least for the female lead, whereas her boyfriend is not college material and tries to make it as a club singer. They try to have a romance, though they have differences, but because they are both scared of their new lives they keep trying to hold on to one another. I can not put my finger on it, but I really like this movie. The soundtrack is great too, with songs of the 60's. This is not a movie with high drama or special effects-- but the script is great in my opinion, for anyone who remembers the struggles and romance of high school, and the fears and struggles of starting out in college or elsewhere after graduation.",1012694400,32,778,4.299319727891157
327391,5,6301415396,"I saw this film during its first, and probably last run. I thought it was wonderful at the time and would love to see it again. At first glance it has some of the attributes of a teen movie, such as Pretty in Pink, but don't be fooled. The characters are drawn with a harsher hand. The backdrop: coming of age in America, boy meets girl, class clash. If you get the chance, watch it.",976665600,9,383,4.12
327392,5,6301415396,"I flipped on the television and got sucked into this movie half way  through.  Had no idea what I was watching and thought it was a light  hearted cheesy movie from the late 70's/early 80's.  Boy was I wrong!  This  movie absolutely blew me away.  I was not at all suprised to learn John  Sayles (Passion Fish, The Secret of Roan Inish) had directed it.  A  fabulous depiction of teenage life and self discovery.  I have never seen  people of this age portrayed so accurately.  I can not get Vincent Spano's  performance out of my mind.  He reminds me of so many of the dumb, yet  loveable (but sometimes ""dangerous"") boys I dated as a young  girl.  It almost gives me the creeps - and yet, keeps me rivoted.  I do not  understand why it is that Vincent Spano has not become a bigger box office  draw.  He is an amazing actor with great range in everything I've seen him  in and also very physically attractive.  Boggles the mind why he hasn't  been in more movies.  And Rosanna Arquette gives an amazing performance as  well as a young girl just realizing what she wants out of life but unable  to break away completely from her youth.  PHENOMENAL!!!  I immediately went  out and bought this movie on eBay - I have to watch it again and again.  Not at all what I expected on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",969235200,26,1300,4.3544303797468356
327393,5,6301415396,"This is one of my all time favorite movies... sometimes the film makers just get it; the dialogue is right, the feel is right... we baby boomers can relate to something here... an age of innocence story, early 60's;  where you still didn't have to take life all that seriously  (pre-Vietnam);  almost another Dinks Stover at Yale / Lawrenceville time in the World.  Everything about this movie is on... the language is just right... the  early 60's elitism, as per Matthew Modine's role and Tracy Pollen really  hit its right.  and Rosanna Arquette as the good-hearted girl from Trenton,  who can still show affection for the ""Sheik"" and humility too...  this movie is a gem.

327445,5,6301415396,"Love this movie. Saw it when it was released in theaters in the early 80's and, though the pacing was somewhat slow, I kept thinking of this film for weeks afterward. There is a lot to be gained from second and third viewings.

The premise of the movie is a relationship between two disparate high school students in early 1960's New Jersey. One a Jewish princess and scholar (Rosanna Arquette), the other a streetwise (but otherwise clueless) Italian Sinatra wannabe (Vincent Spano). Over the course of a few years, the choices they make move them even further apart than when they first met, yet a bond between them is still evinced, down to the last bitter-sweet scene, which is terrific.

The director, John Sayles, was able to obtain the rights to use Bruce Springsteen music in this film which, even though it was the reason I originally went to see it, was recorded almost a decade after the film's time period. An interesting and harmless anachronism. Fell in love with Rosanna Arquette because of this movie.",1410220800,3,1017,4.7727272727272725
327446,4,6301415396,"Baby It's You is John Sayles 1983 movie take on the 1960's with a Jewish Rosanna Arquette hooking up with working-class Italian Catholic Vincent Spano. Both are very good in their roles and Sayles catches the sounds, feel and talk of the time and area, but kind of loses it as she goes off to college and Spano tries to make it as a no-talent Sinatra wannabe. Supporting cast is very good with well known actors in early (or even their first) roles.
The DVD copy is good and clear...but having said that it is necessary to point out that some of the music in the original movie has been changed for the video release. It doesn't hurt too much (although the credits still list the original music), but it is an unfortunate fact that all too often the music in a movie or TV show has been changed when released on DVD or Blu-Ray. Clearly this is because the holders of the music rights wanted too much to let the songs remain on the show or movie for a video release, but to change the soundtrack is almost as bad as messing with the presentation of the movie (such as editing for content, pan and scan, etc.).
The 4 stars is for the movie itself, with 3 1/2 stars for the DVD. Still a very good movie to watch if you haven't seen it before, or even if you have.",1408665600,4,1260,4.232365145228216

327449,5,6301415396,"I didn't think it was possible for someone to make a film about ""neverwithoutespresso,"" the early years, but here it is.
  The banality of my stunted emotional growth at that time: the callowness, the shallowness, the inability to name or understand my own emotions, the total  ignorance of the importance of intimate connection, of the primacy of the heart,  of wanting to be with someone, of the importance of enjoying yourself with someone--besides causing pain and emptiness to me they were like a blunt instrument to those who would offer love.
Rosanna Arquette's character--portrayed brilliantly--and that would be me at that age.
Vincent Spano plays the alive character who tries to break through to Rosanna's soul--also brilliantly.  His passionate scene at the movie's climax is heartfelt and heartbreaking.",1387670400,4,816,5.34375
327450,4,6301415396,"Sometimes, for some people, high school is not the best years of their lives but some of the most troubling. In this low-keyed, understated drama of teenage angst and its aftermath, we are treated to some very three-dimensional characters that we can develop feelings about. We probably all know someone like the movie's characters and it's often sad to think they, too, like the characters in the movie, are ""stuck in an existential rut.""

Very nice acting, good retro music, and realistic situations. Arquette has never been more charming than in this movie; you can really see why she created such a stir a few years back.",1386028800,,625,4.841121495327103

327484,5,6301415396,"I saw this film when it first came out, and it was love at first viewing. I have always liked John Sayles; whether his medium is film or print, he's an amazing storyteller.

This is the bittersweet coming-of-age tale of two star-crossed teenagers growing up in 1960's New Jersey. Jill Rosen (Rosanna Arquette)  is a privileged Jewish girl destined for one of the Seven Sisters colleges and, eventually, marriage to someone with a future. Albert (""Sheik"") Capadalupo is a working-class Italian boy who reveres Frank Sinatra and drives around with his best friend in a hotrod called the Ratmobile. (And yes, there's a story behind Sheik's nickname.) At first, their romance is thrilling: Sheik is madly in love with Jill, and Jill finds bad-boy Sheik exciting.

But when Jill goes off to college, the dynamics of their relationship change. Sayles does this really well: the characters outgrow each other, or rather the environment that propelled their relationship, and they have to find new common ground...if it exists.

Sayles is also a Springsteen fan, and he incorporates a song from each of Bruce's first four albums, in order. Springsteen's music, along with other selections, make this a good soundtrack, too.

Parts of this movie are funny, parts are sad, but it's all compelling. It is just as poignant as ""Breaking Away"" and ""Stand by Me"", though those are buddy flicks and this is a romantic drama. Watch for it on TV or buy a copy and hook up your old VCR. It's a treasure.",1337644800,10,1484,4.849802371541502
327485,4,6301415396,"Haven't seen this movie in a while, but I remember it well. It is the story of a relationship that outlives itself.  Rosanna Arquette's Jill realizes it can never last, but cannot tear herself away from the idea of the relationship, if not the reality.  She finally completes her ""part"" when she visits and sleeps with the Vincent Spano character.  To him, this is proof they belong together.  To her, it is the way to release any obligation she may have felt to him for his loyalty and devotion.  When he tells her he loves her, the response is ""I know.""  Although he doesn't grasp the significance of the response, when I saw it in the theater, it was almost as though I'd been punched in the stomach, it struck so close to home.  Totally realistic view of young love between those of different backgrounds and futures.",1255478400,8,821,4.54421768707483
327486,4,6301415396,"John Sayles' films are never what you think they're going to be, and ""Baby, It's You"" is no exception. Accurately capturing the messiness and immaturity of youth,  Sayles still manages to involve you emotionally with his characters. He gets career  best performances out of Spano and Arquette, and while his film is quite rooted in reality he still manages to pull off a first rate romantic ending. Hey, any film that features both Springsteen and Sinatra on its soundtrack must be worth a watch. More heartwarming than world changing, this one still has the ring of truth to it.",1227052800,5,579,4.838383838383838
327487,5,6301415396,"Two words-Vincent Spano.  I bought this movie so I could look at him again.

I found myself routing for them to be together in the end. I highly recommend it. It definately was the sleeper of its time.",1180051200,4,416,4.2784810126582276
327489,5,6301415396,"This is one of my favorite films and, along with Lone Star, my favorite film of John Sayles. Some of Sayles' films seem to me to be emotionally removed, but not here. He's committed, and it makes all the difference.

It features Rosanna Arquette in a terrific performance that put her on the map. Vincent Spano, the other lead, is good. He's an underrated actor, imo.

The film initially seems to be one of those early 60's nostalgia pics, but soon changes its tone. It is a coming of age film for both Arquette and Spano, primarily Arquette, but Spano's intertwined story, mostly seen from his relationship to Arquette, is also interesting.

Unlike most coming of age films which center of some one event in which the character's naive youthful idealist views receive some a dose of adult world reality, resulting in disillusion, this film shows the growth of Arquette from a high school senior through her first year of college. Like real lives that I'm familiar with, it's a bumpy road with both successes and failures and a lot of insecurities. Events such as sex are important, but they're fit in as one happening among others along that bumpy road to maturation, not some highlight, single defining moment of her life. And, as in other Sayles films, there is an open ended ending, not some neat Hollywood tie up where Arquette emerges having overcome All, with the implicit ""and lived happily ever after.""

The film is quite original this way. It's one I can relate to, in the general way, of my, and I think, most people's development. With Sayles emotional commitment it remains one of my favorite films. I never tire of it.",1166659200,5,1632,4.71578947368421

7811440,5,6301415396,"This wonderful film of youth struggling with disappointment, was released in the era of all the great John Hughes movies like The Breakfast Club and Some Kind of Wonderful.  Well, Sayles possesses that same extraordinary level of sensitivity to the aspirations and virtues of teenagers. It is one of my favorite screenplays, possibly my favorite work of Sayles'.

Arquette is highly believable as Jill, one of the most popular girls at her suburban New Jersey high school.  The film is set in 1965 or 66 when almost 4 million other kids her age were teetering on the brink of 18,  Excellent grades and the top school theatrical roles come easily to Jill, and she's loaded with self confidence.

In one of those odd little situations that can happen to teenagers, good girl Jill meets a young Sinatra-worshipping greser nicknamed The Sheik, played with remarkable sensitivity by Vincent Spano.  An uneasy but genuine bond forms just before Jill goes off to her seven sisters type university. And nothing goes as expected for either of them.  This

Well, I won't spoil anything else about the film, for it's great to see how Jill and The Sheik react to the radically changing social situations that were written as uniquely of the 60's, yet become utterly relatable to anyone who's survived the teenage years.  The screenplay is flawless.

It's absolutely fantastic to have this film back in distribution, because after its theatrical release it did not go to video, due to some lack of contract with Bruce Springsteen's label.  The soundtrack manages to both evoke some sort of eternal Jersey teenage passion (all the Springsteen songs) and also look back sweetly to the era with evocative hits by The Supremes, The Shirelles, and so on.  Anyway, I was hoarding a Pal VHS copy taped off the tv in a 1991 Hong Kong broadcast, because I thought this would never again appear in the western world. But whatever soundtrack licensing issues kept this thing locked up, have been handled.  Got the version with the cover with brown background and stills like a film strip.

And this is everyone's gain.  What a fabulous movie about young love, about the cruelties of strangers, about the clash of innocence and the greater world out there.  Super gift for a teen getting ready to go to college, great gift for someone who forgot what it's like to be that young.",1497139200,,2353,4.830423940149626
