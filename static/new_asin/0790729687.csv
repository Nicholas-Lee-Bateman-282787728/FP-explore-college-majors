90211,5,0790729687,"""Interview With The Vampire"" the book was brilliant, the movie was too. With an all  star cast, with Tom Curse (Lesat), Brad Pitt (Louis), Christian Slater (Reporter),  Antonio Banderas (Armand), Kristen Dunst (Claudia), and Stephen Rea (Santino) you  can't help but fall in love with the tale as you are taken from New Orleans with Louis  and Lesat, then across Europe to Paris with Claudia and Louis and meet the vampires of  Paris in ""The Theatre Des Vampires"".  The talented thespian's take the magic from Anne  Rice's book and turn it into an hour and a half's delight. Read the book then see the film, absolutely worth it.

90237,2,0790729687,"If you remember the book Tom Cruise character 'Lestat' is a tall, imposing figure with rippling muscles and great, magnetic presence. Cruise is tiny, is lilliputian in comparison. Trying to be a tall, dark, stranger in a world where he's a short, stocky sort of schlub is too funny. He's a better George Costanza than a Lestat.",1515628800,,327,4.754385964912281

90271,1,0790729687,"I cannot FOR MY LIFE understand all of the 5 star ratings for this movie.  It was only watchable as a comedy because of how absolutely, mind-bogglingly banal the plot was.  There was no momentum.  Nothing that made me care about any of the characters.  The storytelling was utterly uninspired.  The only thing that would have made this movie marginally palatable was if they actually made the characters as gay as they flaccidly imply.  The second half of the movie is positively unintelligible.

Brad Pitt is so empathetic and passionate, you cannot help but feel for his character. Tom Cruise is charming, but devilish. He is irresistibly fun and intriguing. Kirsten Dunst is so sweet and well ranged in this early role of hers, it's impressive. Interview with the Vampire is touching, funny, sweet, horrifying, and charming all at once.

Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater shine in this and it has some of the best scenery and costumes that I have seen for a vampire story.

90307,5,0790729687,"A lonely in being & step outside of nature that holds no meaning big budget Vampire film.

Tom Cruise's Lestat hold a nihilistic irreverence of being a Vampire that is also self-destructive with a heightened sense of banality to the world.
Brad PItt's Louis was a nihilistic male with a death wish, that when granted eternal life with death alone, develops passion for the meaning of his wish being granted. This gives Lestat an interest which he can admire but does not believe in, about being a Vampire.

The constant need to prey on victums is the damnation of Vampires in cruelty and an intensified feeling of meaninglessness, that goes with their heightened senses. Part of Lestat's interest in choosing Louis is a perverse self-destructiveness as Louis' damnation works in a totally different way to his, which starts driving them apart quite quickly so he creates Claudia - which is only going to make matters worse..

After a honeymoon period, Lestat is soon terribly betrayed in hateful vengeance, although Louis feels some lingering guilt in how they have treated Lestat. Then begins the much slower process of Louis and Cladia drifting apart in hate and boredom of each other.

The film delivers this strongly unique pathos with a stylish period piece grandeur amid a supernatural dramatic tone. Tom Cruise's pronouncedly fixed extrovert, nihilistic, lonely and bored Vampire seems to set the world building tone given to the other characters, particularly the arc given of Brad Pitt's 'Louis'. THis is all greatly helped by the screenplay alchemy of Anne Rices and Jordans. The film is also great to watch with sub-titles and the German voice track, goes really well.

An All Time Seminal Big Budget Vampire FIlm of it's Kind.

(As an aside, i'd say Cruise could jump start a cinematic Vampire chronicals still with abit of artistic license in a Tale of the Body Thief adaptation - i.e. Lestat becomes an older appearing vampire after the switch due to loss of some of the body's natural power due to hosting a new novice essence, the conman, who Cruise could also play with his more normal look, in a fun body switch tale involving 4 roles essentially for something new, after which having diff lestats like james bond, for 'vampire lestat' & 'memock the devil' movies - both also with Cruise playing the switched David Talbot as a secondary character, worked into both tales. A nice fancy anyhow, i want some more! Or good stuff as the reporter says at the end of Interview's movie)",1498780800,,2496,4.875
90308,4,0790729687,Lavishly produced movie. Tom Cruise is having fun and it shows. The middle gets a little slow but the beginning and end are great and Kirsten Dunst turned in a really great performance for someone so young.,1497657600,,206,4.594594594594595

90393,3,0790729687,"First of all, it's not as good as the book of the same name and frankly it's so complex in the book I'm surprised that they were actually able to make the screenplay at all.  The movie is pretty good despite being abbreviated.  At first it was hard for me to see Tom Cruise as a blonde but I got over it.  A tale of 2 vampires, first being Lesat who became a vampire long ago in Paris and Louis, the vampire that Lestat made.  Louis lived on a grand plantation and Letstat was killing (bllod hunt) some of the slaves as well as going into New Orleans to hunt.  At first, Louis would follow him on the hunt until he started feeling bad about killing humans and resorted to rats and chickens.  Finally, the slaves realized that something was up and Louis burned down the plantation.  The rest of the story is most of Louis looking for other vampires and wondering if he and Lesta were all alone.  He even traveled to Europe eating rats.  I won't spoil it for you by telling you any more.",1488412800,2,985,4.224598930481283

It wasn't until the kitchen servant emotionally declared her worry for her enslaver, and said ""will you still be our master at all"" (or something along those lines) that I just couldn't watch anymore. There is something so wrong about that statement that I can't even begin to put into words. Our society somehow makes the reality of slavery so easy to forget, but in case anyone is wondering that is class A BRAINWASHING right there. It doesn't matter whether or not Pitt's character was a ""kind"" master or not. He is responsible for the genocide and enslavement of human beings. No person in their right mind would express any kind of worry or care for the orchestrater of their demise. Yet, she did, and with so much emotion. It honestly felt like a punch in the gut, but what feels worse is the knowledge that a majority of those watching this film didn't think twice about the implications of that scene.

91063,5,0790729687,"Anne Rice knows how to write vampire stories.  This was the film that kicked off the whole ""goth"" and ""emo"" fads. If not for it, ""Hot Topic"" would never have existed.

Long before the sparkle-fest that was fanfic-calibur writer's Stephanie Meyer's attempt at writing a harlequin novel with a vampire backdrop, Anne Rice's first film that explores the more romantic and tragic side of the mythology hit theatres.

Despite the 1990s aesthetic that saturates the film, it's an amazing and well-written story of ""Louie"" (Pitt) and how he has faced a double-edged existence over the centuries.  Told through flashbacks from Louis' perspective, we're introduced to an assortment of melodramatic characters from Louis' ""sire"" (Lestat/Tom Cruise) to his love interest, Claudia (a deadly ingenue played by a young Kirsten Dunst).

I've never really embraced ""goth culture"" nor am I into the whole ""vampires"" thing as a genre but this is a well-crafted film that was adapted from a great book series.  I wholeheartedly recommended it to anyone curious to see what an actually-skilled writer can do with vampires in lieu of the sparkly kind.",1475020800,,1130,5.147540983606557

Yes, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonia Banderas are in this film, but they play creepy roles, not action or sexy roles.  On the contrary, due to the vampire theme, they are wearing some girly makeup and have long-ish fingernails, thus rendering them a bit feminized.  Now, I'm a Adam Lambert fan, so don't get me wrong; it just didn't work for me with these actors.  And I admit - I am not into vampires or vampire movies.

I don't think this type of role isn't best suited for Cruise, therefore his acting and accent just don't cut it.  I really like Cruise in action films, however.  Pitt, Banderas, and Christian Slater do a decent job in their roles.

In my opinion, the only redeeming features of this movie are 1) Kristen Dunsts performance  she did a fantastic job.  BTW, she was only 12-years old at the time of the movies release; and 2) my main takeaway that true peace and happiness comes from within.

Bottom line, I have to say that this is the worst movie with the best cast Ive ever seen.",1474416000,,1254,4.524444444444445

91150,5,0790729687,"Someone said that this movie was too cerebral for horror fans who live for drivel like ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", and too much of a horror movie for people who look (or at least pretend to look) for meaning in movies -- pseudo-intellectuals. That person couldn't have been more correct. I'm not a horror fan, I'm not an Anne Rice fan...I'm not even fond of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Antonio Banderas. But Interview With a Vampire was a movie that excelled my expectations.

I refused to see this film for 3 years because I believed it would be what I perceived it to be: glitzy Hollywood garbage geared toward adolescent girls with posters of the 3 main actors all over their walls. I finally broke down and rented it, and I was astonished by the incredible performances delivered, the thrilling dialogue and the way it was delivered by the actors, the scenery, the plot, the score...everything. I never thought that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise could act, but their performances made their unbelievable characters a reality. However, the true star of the film was Kirsten Dunst. At 12 years old, this girl was able to hold her own against her co-stars, and often stole the scene (particularly the incident in which Claudia tries to cut her hair and subsequently Lestat discovers the corpse in her bed.)

You don't want to look for the meaning of life in this movie. It's a story. The plot is basically the history of a vampire's life, and I don't understand why people are compelled to trash a movie because of its simplicity. Look at the title. That's all it is, and if you expect more you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It's not the deepest of movies, that's why it should be enjoyed for the intense dialogue and the great production that went into it. Others trash the movie because of its homoerotic undertones. This aspect is so fleeting that it's ridiculous to dwell on it, and if you dwell on such an insignificant aspect of the movie then you were obviously looking for something to bother you. One additional thing: to even suggest that the violence in this film could be responsible for incidents such as the Columbine High School killings is beyond moronic.

This isn't the greatest movie that has ever been made, it's certainly not a complex analysis of life, or a parable with a moral dictating the enjoyment of life. It's a brilliantly produced gothic tale of a vampire, nothing more and nothing less. In respect to the book, I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel, here's a clue that might prove useful in the future: the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Don't waste your time complaining about something that is understood.",1473897600,2,2759,4.649590163934426

91204,2,0790729687,"SPOILERS in this review for those who, like me, take 20 years to catch up on movies. First off, as I mention in the subject line, I didn't read this book or any of Rice's novels. My guess is they're better than this film. Second, I can take or leave vampire tales, but a good one, like Bram Stoker's Dracula (film) will stick with me, especially with a performance like Oldman's.

The good: I should say the late 1700s' New Orleans setting is charming and appropriately gothic. Costumes and set design are luxurious.

With that out of the way, my problems with the film are not the acting, as some have chosen to critique. Why? Well, all but one character (Dunst's) lack any semblance of depth, to say the least, especially Louis. I actually feel sorry for Pitt. What did the screenplay adaptation have against Louis, anyway? Just because a writer makes a character flawed and/or annoying doesn't mean he/she should be punished with impoverished development. ... Anyway, my biggest criticism lies basically with several plot holes that I find frustrating. (I won't touch on all of them.)

Here we go.

It's established early on in the film that there are only two ways to kill a vampire:
1) vampire drinks the blood of a dead person;
2) vampire is killed by sunlight.

Fine. But later on, some vampires are killed with other methods, but no explanation is offered as to why these other methods work. Then, to top it all off, Lestat drinks the blood of a dead person, gets his throat slashed (don't get me started on that), and we see him deteriorate before our very eyes until he looks like an extra in Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. BUT Lestat somehow not only hangs on but gets better: so much better, in fact. Did I also mention that some of the dialog is just downright laughable? As well, when the gaggle of lesser vampires force Dunst and another character (I forgot a lot of names and don't care) to their deaths, the vampires carry on more like a bunch of silly high school pranksters with a very dark side than terrorizing creatures of the night. ... And Antonio Banderas is unintelligible to me in any movie, not excluding this one. It's not his Spanish accent; it's that he tries to whisper and wheeze or something, instead of, you know, TALK. Speak up!

Like I said, this is no reflection on Rice's novel, which I haven't read, but after seeing the film version, I have no desire to.

On the bright side, there is a lot of fabulous hair in this movie, particularly Pitt's.",1472947200,,2489,4.579775280898876

91208,2,0790729687,"IMHO, Cruise delivers an awful, contrived performance as the 'mentor' vampire Lestat (sp). The character development leaves a lot to be desired and the plot gives no room to explore vampire lore or legend. Even the historical reference seems shakey at best when referring to what seems to be the 1700s New Orleans fire. On a positive note, a young Kirsten Dunst is the cutest little ringlet adorned monster you ever want to see. Overall I give this title two stars - simply for its appeal to two of my favorite things: period pieces and vampire stories. Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve much praise in either category. (I didn't read the book first, so this review is based solely on the film.)",1472515200,,695,4.75206611570248

It's hard to do a vampire movie well, but this one had something special. If you dig vampire movies, also check out 'Let The Right One In' (not the American re-make, the original dubbed one), it's got some similarities to Interview With the Vampire. If you want a ridiculous but entertaining vampire movie I'd recommend 'What We Do In The Shadows'.",1470700800,,472,4.375

91361,5,0790729687,"As usual-another 'speedy' delivery! I love this movie and, for some reason, it has become increasingly hard to find. I don't know why that is. Anne Rice brings a very unusual take to the vampire legend. She tells it from the vampire's perspective and it brings a sort of compassion to a character that has always been considered a frightening monster. One begins to see that there is a human element to this undead being that would otherwise be a zombie. Mary Shelly did this with the Frankenstein monster and I always liked the way it gave the poor beast feelings. I always wondered when he was going to sit down on a rock in the forest, while running from the villagers, and break out into tears, after having a very bad day! This was also Kirsten Dunst' first movie and I knew she was going to take off. It would not have been the same or as good without her. Man, she was evil! My copy not  only came within a week of ordering, but didn't have a scratch on it. The cover was in pristine condition , too. I will have this for many years to come.

""Take your aesthete's; taste purer things, kill them swiftly if you will, but do it. For do not doubt that you are a killer, Louis!""

the plot

Daniel Molloy, a young freelance reporter from San Francisco conducts an interview with an interesting looking fellow because he claims to be a vampire. When Daniel is suddenly convinced of this gentlemen's claim via an impressive preternatural gesture, the man begins his story. The vampire introduces himself as Louis de Pointe du Lac, born in 1767, and who has become an immortal in 1791. Louis, a Southerner living along the Mississippi River has lived with a serious bout of depression ever since his wife and child died years earlier. He looked and confronted his own death by riling up strangers, yet one stranger he didn't notice was the one lurking and watching him in the shadows, a vampire by the name of Lestat.

Lestat, who was only seven years older than Louis had been a vampire for a few years by now, and searched for a companion to share the nights and the life with. Lestat answers Louis' prayer for death by draining his blood and giving him the choice between death and an immortal life. Louis chooses the vampire life unaware of the damning consequence that comes with it, the perpetual taking of human life in order to feed on their blood. Louis and Lestat are at odds about this moral dilemma. While Lestat is comfortable with his philosophy that as a vampire he is a kind of demigod, and in the same way God kills indiscriminately, so will the vampire. Louis still views himself as human, kind of anyway and his conscience won't allow him to kill without the consequence of guilt.

Louis finds himself again depressed and at odds with life and wishes to leave it behind by suicide. Lestat rescues him, but it does little to lift his spirits. Lestat makes another vampire of a young girl to urge him to stay. This girl, Claudia, may be more trouble for the vampire duo than they would have thought she'd ever be. Watch and see what happens in this first installment of The Vampire Chronicles, Interview With The Vampire.

the breakdown

I think the quote I used at the top of the review sums up this film pretty accurately. Louis who was yearning for death when human instead opted for a new and different existence. As a vampire he existed only in a constant state of depression with a moral deficiency when he learned that his survival depends on the suffering of others. It sounds like a delicious political pun doesn't it? Louis is miserable to learn that Lestat could give him no reason to excuse the fact that he must kill. He eventually went to Europe and found a basement full of vampires, and despite that some of these creatures were much older than Lestat; they could offer no better reasoning to excuse the sin of murder. It took him nearly 200 years to learn what they already seemed to know; you cannot be something you aren't. No matter how Louis tried to slice it, he was a human no more.

Brad Pitt is billed second to Tom Cruise, but Pitt is the star of the film here. His portrayal as Louis de Pointe du Lac brings to life Anne Rice's character in much more of a vivid existence than Rice could have hoped. Pitt's emotional performance was stirring at points and downright perfect in my opinion. However, Lestat's role cannot be understated, and Tom Cruise brings validity and a real seriousness to the character and the film. It is pretty well known that author Anne Rice was livid with disgust with the casting of Cruise as her beloved Lestat. Of course this was all before she'd actually seen the film. After she beheld Cruise's masterful performance here she issued several apologies, including one that even used to start off the DVD version of the film. It should be important to point out that these two actors had brought a darkness and weight to this film. After all, this is just another vampire film. Compare it with the sequel (The Vampire Lestat) to this film and it's like night and day, Dracula and Edward Cullen. Yes, in Queen of the Damned, without Tom Cruise as the star, the lead character is reduced to a wimpy Twilight kind of vampire. Yet no matter how much I love their performances, my favorite scenes have to do with a young Kirsten Dunst who portrays the young vampire Claudia. In my opinion, this is still by far Dunst's best performance of her career. She is innocent, sneaky, evil, beautiful, deadly and more and all at the same time. She is perhaps even more evil and deadly than Lestat himself, as you never know what to expect from such a being. The Vampire Armand is played by Antonio Banderas, and although he was fantastic, his appearance was kind of odd. His appearance is big and dark, and with the long hair, the long fingernails and heavily powdered face, it was like stuffing a football player into a tutu. Instead of looking like a vampire, he seems more like a Spaniard dressed in drag. Why did the casting and producers alter Armand's character so much anyway, in the book he is a young teenager.

Please do not be mistaken; this is in no way tame or anything like the Twilight Series. There is bloody violence here, nudity and a central theme around the killing of humans in order to live. Yet having said that, around the time of its release there was certainly a lot of excitement especially from the females (and those who would find Armand's appearance alluring) about Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise as vampires. Both actors have been named sexiest man alive by People Magazine in their day, and this film was released during their absolute heyday. This film however is for adults, and not for a Twilight audience. Although there is no cussing to be found, there is an abundance of violence and a full frontal female nude scene provided by Laure Marsac. It's a shame that the sequel was so lame, but to be fair, this is how the book was written. The director went for camp with Queen of the Damned with Lestat the rock star, a blatant and shameless female fantasy instead of the Lestat we loved from the original book, and some of the latter books. Now Anne Rice is hinting that Lestat may live again on the screen, with rumors of Robert Downey Jr. in the title role,...well stupider things have happened.

Don't let the big name actors fool you into believing that this movie will be worth the watch--because it won't. The plot is rather unclear due to confusing transitions and left out information. There doesn't seem to be any sort of climax, nor is there a outstanding conflict. Granted, it's a movie based around the autobiography of a fictional man's life but come on, with a fictional story-line the writers could've written literally any kind of conflict into the script to make it a little more interesting. Unfortunately that did not happen and as a result the final product was underwhelming and left the audience wanting more. For anyone with any regard for quality film and acting, stay away from this picture.",1447113600,2,882,5.0479452054794525

And when Tom leaves the film and it's up to Brad Pitt  to carry the show, he can't deliver, and the film becomes plodding. It's compelling, but I was looking for a subtext to give some weight to the relentless unpleasantness, but there's not one. Christian Slater and Stephen Rea brighten things up in small roles.

BTW, the book is much better.  That being said, I enjoyed watching the film again (20+ years later).  I thought it was kind of slow before young Kristen Dunst's character appeared, and I think she acted better than both Tom and Brad.  Don't get me wrong, I think they (really more Brad than Tom) are good actors, but she REALLY stole the show.  I was also a bit confused over in Paris, but I think I understand the premise (vampire kills another...or makes another at such a young age, needs to die - or something like that).  I like the philosophical ideas about the ""reluctant vampire"" and other issues that was portrayed in the movie and not necessarily simply blood and gore.  Pretty good.

Anne Rice is one of my favorites as well. to me she seems to be the only ones that truly understands what a vampire is and their nature. Twilight, True Blood, American Horror Story Hotel can't touch this film or Anne Rice's genius. There should be other films featuring Tom Cruise as Lestat. Robert Townsend was horrible. Queen of The Damned was awful and killed my reality of the series. It was Aaliyah's last film and she was beautiful and dangerous in it.",1445126400,,727,4.345588235294118

not normally a fan of Tom Cruise, i never have liked him. nothing personal, he's a very talented actor. i just don't like the typical action movies that he stars in. in this movie however, you got to see a softer and more comical side to Tom Cruise, and i think it showcased how versatile he is in his profession. he played his character superbly. i wish there were more horror movies out there like it, as i think this movie should serve as the blueprint as to how a Vampire should be portrayed in modern day cinema and film. no need for ridiculous and excessive amounts of blood, guts and gore if you have class and an outstanding script.",1444780800,,1082,4.606217616580311

Both demonstrated they are very capable movie actors, who have a lot more to offer as actors beyond their good looks. ""Interview with a Vampire"" is a very good motion picture experience. This movie is the kind of film that would have been an enjoyable night at the movies, back in the days when people actually went to movie theaters. As home theater experience, the surround sound audio is excellent and picture quality is very good. About my third or fourth time having viewed this film over a twenty year span and it's still enjoyable.

Antonio Banderas did an excellent portrayal of his character, Stephen Rea and Christian Slater played their parts quite well, too.  But, the big surprise was Kirsten Dunst who was the most animated, adorable yet shocking vampire of them all.

In my interpretation of the story Ive felt that the vampires symbolized predatory opportunistic folks, some of which one could identify as contemporary elitists and/or power hungry individuals, sucking the blood of their inferior victims. The intrigues in the storyline were built gradually in a great suspense. The brilliant contrast between the characters of Lestat and Louis compelled the viewer to sympathize with Louis due to his scruples, moral virtue and love for mankind. Armand, however, takes a full advantage of Louiss weakness, which is the love for humanity, in order to unleash his rage against his own species of vampires. A once humanoid, which has been reluctantly transformed into a vampire cannot kill humans, because he despised the beast that he has become, and yet, killing vampires out of revenge was easier than to kill humans for the sake of survival; Great message through the character of Louis. All in all this film had it all: great actors, great storyline, great choreography, great music and great message.

91887,5,0790729687,"Absolutely amazing ""Vampire"" epic film that follows the book fairly well.  Tom Cruise, at the time a little girl Christine Duntse, and Brad Pitt are outstanding portraying the elegant but ultimately demonic & undead debutants of the ""enlightenment era"".  Anne Rice's work takes us to a secret hidden dark underworld of an unknown world history featuring the unholy lives of 1700 to early 1800's vampires in both America and Europe.

 On this fantasy journey we are guided by Brad Pitt, who in more modern times reveals the true history to a reporter about the hidden lives of vampires and their spectacular deeds.  The vampire Lestat (Cruise), is a dark menace of the unholy demonic order who brings Brad Pitt's character into this unknown alien world, turning him into another vampire because Lestat desires the need for a companion and friend in his lonely world.

 They live as vampires on a Southern plantation in old French Louisiana,  living eerie and ghoulish lives until they stumble upon a little girl who is a victim of the plague.  Out of pity and grief they turn this little girl into a member of the dark undead, where what ever innocence she had held in her mortal life previously had vanished forever and in it's place came a dark and vicious creature of the night who indulges herself on the blood of mortals, and doing so with a relishing delight.

On a journey to the old world of Europe, in search of the elder leader and supreme high priest of the secret vampire order, Pitt and the vampire girl ""Claudia"" travel among the underworld seeing beings who are more terrifying and fiendishly ghoulish then they are, opening the viewer's awareness that this is indeed a secret and sinister Satanic history of beings living among the Earth with men, but hold a dark agenda that Pitt's character is in direct conflict with due to his own ethically driven moral and human idealism in which the plague of vampirism has not taken from his mind, heart, and soul.

 This film is remarkable both in drama, costumes, plot, imagery, special effects, and acting bringing people into the world of vampires and showing them, through Pitt's account to the reporter, what this dark unholy world really is.

 It was too bad they had never made a good sequel to this film, because ""Queen of the Damned"" in movie form is absolute garbage & not worthy of being compared to this masterpiece.  Hope one day that more of Anne Rice's work will be turned into another Hollywood feature, and maybe Brad Pitt and Cruise may want to return to this fantasy vampire world for the fan's sake one last time??? One can hold out.

 Five stars for ""Interview with the Vampire"", not since"" Bram Stoker's Dracula"" has a movie really captured the awe and wonder of the vampire fantasy world in such a profound way.  A must for fellow vampire fans.",1423958400,,2824,4.716904276985743

People can be consumed willy-nilly, but my kids were outraged that a vampire would eat a puppy-dog. We had to pause the movie and assure them no dogs were actually harmed to get them to stop yelling at the T.V.

 I'm Old School. Vampires, require whatever needs done to destroy them, done to them(period).

 If that made you wonder, go flush your drug of choice down the toilet; take a nap for a few days; come back and read it again.

I watched it for the first time some twenty years ago, when I was just 8 or 9 years old. Believe it or not, I was already a fan of vampire fiction, movies mostly; but it opened up a whole world of literary fiction for me.
I must have been 10 when I read my first 'Vampire Chronicle', ""The Vampire Lestat"". I chose to start with the second novel because I wanted to know what happened after the events of the movie. The movie stayed with me, and its images have never left my mind.
For me, few adaptations have ever been capable of achieving as much as this movie - it truly is faithful to the original work, and yet it is its own piece of art.
Let us hope Universal studios use it as inspiration for the future Lestat movies to come!",1410566400,,826,4.136645962732919

Anybody whose here knows that Interview with the Vampire is a great movie, the Blu Ray release of which is long overdue. It's one of those movies, along with Flight Club and Inglorious Basterds, that reminds you Brad Pitt is actually a damn good actor. We also get a particularly memorable performance from Tom Cruise before he reached that point in his career when he started phoning it in.

Not much to say about this particular version until it's released, but the audio and video quality on my current BR edition is excellent. The special features we know of thus far include:
- Lestat, Louis, and the Vampire Phenomenon: A conversation with author Anne Rice about her influence on the new wave of vampires as heroes and anti-heroes.
- Director's Commentary with Neil Jordan
- In the Shadow of the Vampire
- Introduction by Anne Rice, Neil Jordan and Antonio Banderas
- Theatrical Trailer

92207,5,0790729687,"This blu-ray release won't be released until late September but since one Amazon member decided to throw a review out there, I thought I might chime in with some hopes and concerns about this new release.

I, too purchased the first release of this title on Blu-ray a few years ago.  But first let me say this is one of only a handful of my FAVORITE films in the genre AND one that is watchable for God knows how many viewings.  Well, as I was saying I purchased the first blu-ray of this movie and I was really let down by what the studio did and didn't do.  Firstly the soundtrack was created originally in theaters as superior along with the visuals.  There was a DVD release many years prior. The DVD's audio was I believe DTS 5.1 or DD 5.1. The visuals were fairly good throughout.  Back to the 1st BD release the sound was DD 2.0 and the picture extremely grainly throughout.  I kept this blu-ray ONLY because I'm a huge fan of this picture.

My hopes for this new release would be a remastered or restored video and at least a DTS 5.1 soundtrack. I will take my chances and buy it on first release date but I will return it if the studio releases this as a downgrade.",1407110400,2,1174,4.256756756756757

I do believe, however, that this is due to the original sound mixing. I used to own the original DVD from a decade ago and the sound quality was bad on that one too. I'm assuming it was a mixing and mastering issue.  If they ever remaster this and remix the sound then this would be an absolute re-purchase.

Being a film I love with all of my heart and being a vampire fanatic, this is still the single best film I have seen on vampires (beating only Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula). But, why is this film great? Simple: Anne Rice. Adapting her own novel, she was able to write a screenplay that not only surpasses her novel (DON'T KILL ME, ANNE!), but also caused me to start learning and loving my life more. That is the entire point and the moral of this tale: live your life to the fullest and embrace your life, no matter what it is. And, thankfully, Anne Rice along with Neil Jordan and the entire cast brings this to life in ways that I can't even imagine. My only response: Dear Anne Rice, if you ever need a break from novels, please start writing films. Seriously. Why you never decided to write other films after this one, I don't know.",1406160000,,906,4.366863905325443

92564,1,0790729687,"All I could see in this movie was a vacuous celebration of over-the-top gore and killing.  The Brad Pitt character is so depressed after the loss of his wife that he allows himself to be turned into a vampire, so that he can have all of eternity to continue to feel sorry for himself (while also occasionally killing innocent people and then feeling bad about it).  This is in contrast to the Tom Cruise character who revels in the delight of killing (and always with some sort of twisted sexual allusion).  Of course there is more to it than this, but in essence it's just more of the same: lots of blood and lots of sick sexual innuendo associated with the murder of lots of people, the majority of whom are suggested to be of loose morals.  The light in all this darkness is supposed to be the Brad Pitt character, but I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for his deep angst at his condition given that he was so blinded by self-absorption that he doesn't even think about how he might be able to try to use his extraordinary powers for greater good.  Although it came highly recommended and with a star-studded cast, the whole thing just left me feeling physically ill and wishing that I had done anything else with my two hours and $3 than subject myself to this abomination.  My husband actually stopped watching halfway through and I wish I had followed suit rather than sticking it out and waiting for it to get better (which it never did).  I have not read the books (obviously) so my comments are just based on the movie.",1383955200,,1533,4.434163701067615

92695,2,0790729687,"Interview with the vampire was based on the mega seller with the same name by the gothic styled author Anne Rice. Being a big hit for the fans, many scripts were rejected before she finally decided to give in on this one. Some key points of IWTV are very daring but I'll discuss them below.
 The plot is simple yet it's also not. No classic vampire tale here, folks. ""It's fun to be a vampire"" is proven to be a lie. Instead the more realistic outlook is taken. Living centuries through death and massive change must take a toll on the mind. Taking blood and killing to sustain ones existence robs one of 'life'. Through the ages the human side slowly dissolves, and you grow colder despite the warmth of your 'drink', until one day everything about you that existed before is dead and won't be coming back.

So goes the woes of the main character, Louis, who spends the movie mourning his existence. He was a depressed human being and once brought to the other side by Lestat, not much changes. Some light in his life is brought with the birth of Claudia, but even that doesn't last, as the viewer is sure to know.

The depressed vamp wafts through the ages full of sorrow and regret, never enveloping the onster he has to be. His creator, Lestat, long ago accepted the killer mode (in fact, embraced it), and is shown for the majority of the first half of the long flick. The big shocker here is all are played by big names, not something usual for a horror picture.  Brad Pitt oozes sex appeal as Louis and mourns like no one else. His bare chest, long hair, and deep green eyes is enough to make me pop in this flick. Tom Cruise kicks out the comedy and action roles to play a conniving, twisted vampire longing for a companion. While his character was not as 'nice', it was the most addictive. Antonio Banderas stars as the long haired, overly pale Armando.

Claudia...well, everyone seems to love her. I didn't. Kirsten Dunst has Claudia written all over her, yet her character annoyed me to no end. I don't care about her being a child vampire, her actions came off spoiled and bitter. Sure, I can understand to a point, and even sympathize, but overall she came off as a manipulative little bitch who thought only of herself. Lestat may have been 'hardened', but I didn't see him display the capability for cruelty that this little child did.

The film is absolutely riveting, and if I could think of just one word to describe it, I'd choose this one: beautiful. Beautiful colors, beautiful scenery, beautiful music, beautiful dialogue, beautiful clothing, beautiful men. Through the ages we see everything in a Gothic, polished style. The clothing, manner, and poise of the characters sent me senses reeling. It cannot be said for many horror films, or movies in any genre, that the environment is this darn 'pretty.'

Elliot Goldenthall's music score for the film is amazing and helped enriched what all the film represents: beauty, betrayal, hunger, rage, and loss. I've played the soundtrack countless times, all of them being classical except one (Sympathy for the devil.) The music inspires me like no other instrumental collection ( so far ).

Pacing wise, the movie's a trifle slow. Eventful but in that lazy, lethargic manner that allows character development. Overall a bleak and grey existence for everyone in the end, and the film certainly takes the time to let the viewer know this. For a vampire flick the violence isn't extreme, but it counts as a realistic gesture once shown. Some cruel (particularly the tortured woman over the coffin), but none of the 'splatter -mainstream' stuff seen in Lost Boys or Near Dark.

The ending is dark, bleak, but fit the rest of the production perfectly. It's hard to imagining a horror fan not liking this film at all, but I can understand how Louis's whining can grate on the nerves. He overdoes it at times and after awhile you just want the guy to get drunk and take a few prozacs, find a hot woman, and take a vacation. Surely there's something in life to be found somewhere for him! I also mourned the loss of Lestat in the second half, as he really spiced things up more. He had a sick, ironic humor and made things a bit more exciting. When he vanished, so did some of the entertainment value. When he does show up again, there are several gaping questions left hanging in the air concerning him.

So, obviously this movie is far from perfect. Not all the characters were sympathetic. However, it's still more than worth a watch and a gorgeous piece of horror cinema that remains faithful to the book, showcasing all the genuine human emotion and angst.",1379635200,2,4621,4.624390243902439
92696,4,0790729687,"I'll confess that I went through an Anne Rice phase many years ago, it started of course with the first novel 'Interview with a Vampire', while many might blame her for the current trend of turning them into teen romances, at least she kept them as monsters. Charming monsters perhaps, but still monsters.

As with the book the film tells of Louis, a grieving and morose landowner from New Orleans centuries ago turned into a vampire by Lestat, it then tells the story of his life over the centuries. Brad Pitt does a reasonable job of the ever miserable Louis, as in Meet Joe Black he plays the urbane monster well.

Tom Cruise wouldn't have been my first choice to play Lestat, he lacks the stature for starters. However he does play the role well and gets across the devilish fun of the character. There's a few other well known names dotted throughout the film. I think it's fair to say that they all ham it up a bit with their performances, but in context it works.

In parts beautiful, in parts horrific, this is a decent vampire film and a lot of fun to watch.",1379462400,,1067,4.433673469387755

92706,1,0790729687,"I'm going to get crucified for this, considering that this film has its legions of devoted fans, but I found this to be one of the worst films I've ever laid my eyes on.  Yes, the production values are astonishing in parts and Kirsten Dunst delivers a remarkable child performance, but outside of those two aspects I found the delivery of what could have been an intriguing and unique story to be so uneven and calculated that it lost all impact and become underwhelming and unbearable.

And stupid.

Personally, I found this really hard to get into.  I know many fans of the novel, and Rice's contributions to literature in general.  I'm not her target audience, I know that.  I'm not a follower, I've never read her work and the whole vampire craze is lost on me.  That being said, I do enjoy movies of all genres and so for me the themes and subject would not be an issue if the film were constructed well.  Instead, this brooding piece of boredom misses so many golden opportunities and winds up being a nonsensical mess that fails to capitalize on all the potential it has.  The story itself is rather intriguing, but Neil Jordan fails to do anything exciting with the material.  Instead, he cuts back and forth and serves up segments of scenes that are supposed to create a whole but wind up becoming rather lost in this sea of mundane.  The tone of the film is so low-key that it winds up being horribly boring and uneventful, even in the moments of supposed high intensity.

Another detractor is the uneven performances.  Brad Pitt plays Louis as if he was sleepwalking through the film, and Tom Cruise is so over the top eccentric that the two feel as if they were in two separate films altogether.  As mismatched as they are, Antonio Bandaras takes the film to a whole new low when he pops up.  A truly ridiculous performance and in fact, his whole segment just feels so soap opera cheap.  At least Kirstin Dunst serves up some savage realness.  It's a tremendous performance trapped in a terrible movie.",1376611200,9,2014,4.5654596100278555

Kirsten Dunst is amazing as Claudia, Tom Cruise is very good as Lestat (like the author, I had doubts about his casting, but he pulls it off pretty well), Antonio Banderas is perfectly tragic (and a bit creepy) as Armand, and Brad Pitt is sensually stunning as Louie (though seeing the movie now (2013), I have to keep reminding myself that, yes, he WAS that young once).  My only real criticism is that I think Brad Pitt should have studied a bit with another actor or coach who was experienced in narration, because his skills in that one area aren't nearly as impressive as his acting chops (at least not in this, admittedly very early in his career, film).",1371686400,,893,4.575

92752,4,0790729687,"It's strange to think that (at the time of this review) the film adaptation of Anne Rice's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interview-with-the-Vampire/dp/0345409647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interview with the Vampire</a>&nbsp;is nearly twenty years old. Looking back at the likes of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst, it's funny to see where they've ended up since the release of this film! But most people, even big fans of the book, seem to generally agree that this is a good adaptation of the original novel, remaining faithful to the source material whilst still making the necessary changes in order to transfer it from page to screen (no doubt helped by the fact that it was Anne Rice herself who wrote the screenplay).

In a darkened apartment in San Franciso, the vampire Louis tells his life story to a captivated journalist, divulging details on how he became a vampire, what it was like to make the transition, the companions that he spend years of his immortal life with, the struggle with his bloodlust and his quest to find answers as to the history and meaning of vampirism. Key players in his tale are the charismatic and selfish Lestat, the vampire who made Louis like him in body if not spirit, and Claudia, the little girl turned into a vampire and so doomed to spend all of eternity in a child's body.

In the 18th century Louis was a wealthy plantation owner mourning the loss of his wife and child when he's approached by the vampire Lestat, who promises an end to his suffering. But unbeknownst to Louis, Lestat's motives are hardly altruistic. He's interested in the estate and lifestyle that Louis can provide him with, as well as in need of some companionship. Louis agrees to the change and in due time is transformed into a vampire. At first the two immortals get along well, with Lestat teaching Louis about how to drink blood and conceal himself in a coffin come daybreak, but eventually Louis becomes disillusioned with his companion's cruelty toward humans and his refusal to divulge any information on how he in turn became a vampire.

In a bid to keep Louis by his side, Lestat turns a five year old girl that Louis (in a fit of despair and bloodlust) has drunk from into a vampire, thus binding the little family of three together forever. But as the years pass by and Claudia does not grow into a woman, she begins to question and then rail against the authority that Lestat holds over them. Of course, domestic arguments in a house full of vampires are significantly more murderous and bloody than what human beings are used to, and soon Louis and Claudia are on the run to Europe, seeking out other vampires in their search for answers.

Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt initially seem like bizarre casting choices as vampires considering their All-American Golden Boy personas, yet by some miracle they actually pull off the roles. Brad Pitt embodies a permanent air of sadness and thoughtfulness that brings depth into what is now a clich: the broody, introspective, tormented vampire. His gloom and despondency is offset by Lestat's mockery and enjoyment of vampiric life, and though these days he's better known for scientology, multiple divorces and jumping on Oprah's couch, Cruise's performance as Lestat demonstrates that whatever else is going on in his life - the man can act. At different stages Lestat can be capricious, self-absorbed, charming, dangerous, terrifying, pathetic and hilarious. His interactions with Louis and Claudia as the patriarch of their strange little family forms the crux of the film, and his absence in the film's second half (due to the necessities of the plot) is sorely felt.

Kirsten Dunst is the real standout though. On paper it may sound relatively easy to play a vampire child (just look and sound creepy, right?) but Claudia is more than just that - she's a woman in a child's body. It really is extraordinary how well someone as young as Dunst was at the time could pull this off: that you can actually see her age from a child to a thirty-year old even though her appearance doesn't change at all. Yet in the first half of her appearance she has a child's mannerisms and speech patterns; in the second it's not difficult to imagine her as a very sophisticated young adult. And on top of all that, she has to capture the inherent creepiness of a bloodsucking fiend, reminding the audience that she's also someone to be scared of as well as fascinated by.

In the final act we are introduced to Antonio Banderas as Armand, said to be the oldest living vampire in existence, and his coven of vampires which embody the dismal nature of immortality, alternating between clownish cruelty on the stage and lethargy in the underground crypt. It is these Parisian vampires that provide the fiery climax to the film, followed by Louis's gentle summing up of the most recent years of his life to the gob-smacked interviewer.

It's a wholly unique storyline, yet it is the visual style of the whole thing that really raises the bar. Neil Jordan has always been good at crafting beautiful films, and he's completely at home in the supernatural genre. The period costumes, the opulent settings, the liters of crimson blood - it's all depicted in lavish detail and infused with a wickedly dark sense of humor. The artistry of the hair and makeup crew turn the cast into legitimately uncanny looking creatures of the night, and as the film was made on the cusp of computer graphics, in many ways it's a last hurrah for old school special effects.

Sure, there are a few odd choices: Lestat biting Louis for the first time whilst levitating up through the air, and the blinking statue (to demonstrate the vividness of vampire senses) didn't work out as well on screen as it did in the book, but what Jordan really excels at is the depicting these unchangeable vampires passing through a variety of environments across the course of history.

All in all, this is a surprisingly good film adaptation of a novel that changed the course of the vampire genre. With an intoxicating visual flair and better-than-expected performances from its cast, ""Interview with the Vampire"" flips the perspective on vampires - no longer existing as a cautionary tale to human beings, but as characters in their own right.",1370131200,3,6313,4.8815298507462686
92753,4,0790729687,"I remember some time ago, before the actual release of this first film adapted from an Anne Rice novel, upon hearing the news that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt would play the two lead roles, Rice was very upset and didn't invision anyone even close to either actor playing these characters she had penned. After she saw the film, to say the least, she was very pleased. Neil Jordan and crew created an incredible rendering of the Novel. Interview with the Vampire manages to capture and ignite the screen with nearly the same passion as the novel had. Cruise and Pitt proved to be not only good in the roles, but sort of reinvented their characters while still giving the audience what it had hoped for, a rendering true to the novel. Some who have seen the film were not pleased with Antonio Banderas being cast as Armand. This is obviously because the Armand of the book is visualized as looking very different. But as it turns out Banderas delivers probably the best performance in the entire film. His portrait of Armand is absolutely brilliant. Also his custumes and makeup made him truly freightening and believable. After I saw the film the first time I remember remarking to my fellow film goers that the film was ""The Gone With the Wind of vampire movies"". After seeing this movie the other day for the fourth of fifth time I think that statement might be very well true the more I think about it even if it seemed silly at the time. Every aspect of the film is top notch. Sets, Costumes, acting, script, direction, and the interpretation of the book were all excellent.

92756,5,0790729687,"The first film adaptation of Anne Rice's flagship novel never fails to impress me.  Although there are a number of discrepancies from the book the movie has enough gravitas on its own to maintain staying power as an impressive storyline in its own right.

The surprise performance of Tom Cruise in his portrayal of the vampire Lestat defied the expectations of both Ms. Rice and movie goers alike and is a rare instance of the actor maintaining the poise he demonstrated in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" as having the potential to be a legendary icon were he to maintain this level of commitment to all of his roles.  This movie undoubtedly owes much of its success to Cruise who not only brings Lestat to life from the pages but also adds an air of the character's mischievous nature bordering on evil due to his full acceptance of vampiricism.

There have been mixed critiques of Pitt's role, many of which allude to a belief he demonstrated the same level of apathy that led to the awkward and often considered disastrous performance in ""Meet Joe Black.""  I disagree and tend to think this was his first truly distinguished role before ""Legends of the Fall"" because he faithfully captured Louis's somber and morose reluctance to embrace the necessity of nightstalking to maintain his existence once transformed.  Some may consider Kirsten Dunst's performance somewhat over the top but it is a gifted casting of a promising prodigy child star.

The scenery and costumes are excellent given that this movie predates CGI and its cheapening effects for bombast.  The storyline is pretty easy to follow although Pitt's narration seems a bit mellow and forced during the abrupt transitions during decades.  The portion focusing on a Parisian vampire troupe in Paris has a bit of a non sequitur sentiment that lacks a smooth segue, but it provides a necessary explanation of the greater existential questions of vampirism.  Antonio Banderas has a very independent role as Armand that resembles the characters in Rice's series in no form or fashion but is captivating regardless, although his role as an explanatory elder lacks satisfactory completion to substantively provide the audience with more than a predictable mythos for nosferatu in general.  The scenery for Spanish Colonial New Orleans is also much more engrossing than nineteenth century Paris but it isn't much of an issue for the themes in each chapter.

The only real drawback of the film is that it loses most of its momentum halfway through and becomes somewhat of a lumbering philosophical account involving navel gazing and devolves into a vampire massacre with primal notions of undead justice that could be misconstrued as an attempt to liven the overly analytical storyline.  This film has its share of violence, onscreen blood, and some rather explicit nudity in a few places, and much of the obscure film noir mood may be somewhat depressing for general audiences who aren't attracted to historical periods or fantasy genres involving supernatural beings.  But its fairly realistic in terms of suspension of belief for ""what if vampires really existed?"" and does not devolve into the comic book extravagance typical of other films such as the ""Dusk til Dawn"" series that mirror the choreographed antics of Hong Kong martial arts action films.  Mostly this movie should appeal to contemplative cerebral luminaries that like to ask questions about the meaning of things and can maintain focus on a plot that takes some time to let its audience follow it to a conclusion.",1367539200,2,3537,5.001703577512777

The bits of dark humor injected in by Cruise made it rather enjoyable at times. Brad Pitt did a good job as the vampire with a bit of his human-ness causing him to lament (whine about) his fate throughout. His acting is stellar in the final sequences. Kirsten Dunst's character, 10-year old Claudia, as an unreachable love/soul mate for Louis (Pitt) was the essential ingredient that makes it all work. She did a great job.

Pitt is sympathetic in the lead, with Kirsten Dunst holding her own as the vampire in an eternal girl's body. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea do very different turns as vampires. Despite getting the top billing, Tom Cruise is a supporting player as Lestat, and unfortunately is the only weak part of the cast, as usual playing himself.

92855,4,0790729687,"You've read Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice haven't you? If not don't watch this movie until you've read it!

It took me along time to accept the idea of Tom Cruise playing a vampire. A very long time. It seemed ridiculous. I couldn't possibly picture him doing it in any good way. But eventually I ended up watching the movie.

Tom Cruise looked totally unlike himself in this movie. The film was made in the mid 90s so that might have something to do with it. But it was more than that. He looked totally unlike himself and he did an incredible job acting for this movie. I don't know how this came to be. Somehow he set aside his type mediocre acting for exceptional acting in this film.
Enough about Tom Cruise though.

This movie begins, as the book does, with a young man asking the vampire Louis for an interview. Louis agrees to tell his life story. Louis has his own personal reasons for doing this. He feels a need to tell his story and that the time is right to do so.

The film skips the details of Louis' background. From there it stays fairly close to the book while leaving out a large amount of detail. For example, the wealth that Louis brought with him that allowed him to lead the lifestyle that he had.(Not to mention loot from dead victims.)
The characterization and character development of the movie is very strong. Philosophical questions are explored and discussed. That is largely what the book is all about and Anne Rice was involved in the project to make sure he vision was realized.
The cinematography of this film is very good. I didn't notice it lacking at all. And poor cinematography and directing is what often kills otherwise good stories. But that wasn't the case here so I was pleased.
It was a fun and moving film to watch even though I knew the story. But with truly great novels they deserve to be read first before any movie adaption is seen.
The ending of the film, is a little different from what I remember in the book. But I think that perhaps it was meant to be a hint at next book and Lestat taking the role of a rockstar.
I think this was a very good film adaption of an incredible novel.
The movie is not a masterpiece(few films are) but it is very good. I recommend it to anyone who has read the book.",1354492800,,2260,4.348341232227488

92897,4,0790729687,"I avoided the book, and I avoided the film for the longest while, too. Over ten years, it says here. But Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas are almost as desirable to me as Johnny Depp, so when I got a bargain on it, I bought it. I'm not sure whether I'm glad or not.

It's a horror film, alright, although it's beautifully filmed. The actors, set designers, location scouts, special effects men, costume designers, lighting men (oh, yes; many problems with light in the film, artfully solved) all did their jobs well.

One of the reasons I avoided this film was the vampire Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst, who is only a child. Rather small child, in fact, maybe 7 or 8 years old. People who become vampires never age past the day they were bit. But their minds mature, they can learn things, and so she seems to be a child prodigy, playing the piano like an expert, dancing majestically, talking like an adult (way too much like an adult), and having the passions of an adult. But not the body.

This disturbed me, and was the main reason I avoided the book and movie all these years. After all, this little girl (who must obviously be played by a child actress) is traveling with two very adult, very sensuous men. She eventually screams at them, ""Which one of you did this to me?"" and throws a considerable tantrum over the whole thing.

Claudia turns out to be the most vicious and heartless of the three. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is bold and unapologetic, but points out he was not given a choice when he was made a vampire, the way he gave Louis (Brad Pitt) a choice. Eventually we meet the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas) who ""created"" Lestat. But Louis has a conscience, and tries to survive on the blood of ""rats and poodle dogs,"" as Lestat sneeringly described it. But as Lestat predicted, he eventually got over that.

They started in New Orleans, then went traveling, especially to Paris. There Armand followed Louis one day and, to prove he was a real vampire, danced on the ceiling of an archway. He gives Louis a card announcing the Vampire Theater, and Louis & Claudia go see it. It doesn't take them long to realize that what they are seeing is vampires pretending to be humans playing vampires. They also figure that the young woman who ""plays"" a sacrificial victim at the end of the play really is dead.

OK, I'll not spoil it for you. Let's just say it's harder to kill a vampire than Buffy lead you to believe.",1337040000,,2438,4.492099322799097

92913,4,0790729687,"""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is a horror drama film, based on the interview confessions of Louis de Pointe du Lac, played by Brad Pitt. The narrative essentially follows Louis and Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) and their partnership as vampires. Lestat is the senior of the two and Louis is his protg. Louis' journey begins in Louisiana, then to France, and he travels much of the world before returning to America. Louis and Lestat have a challenging friendship, as Louis is at first a reluctant vampire, and this leads to many confrontations between the two of them. The narrative is spread over 200-years, which provides for some interesting transformations in terms of Louis and Lestat's philosophies as vampires. Pitt and Cruise both display credible horror genre acting skills.

92917,2,0790729687,"I recently read Anne Rice's famous book, and enjoyed it immensely; then I rented this movie version, and enjoyed it ... not so much.

The trouble is that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a very cerebral book that deals with tough topics like existential dread, our right (or lack thereof) to kill, the nature of ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the existence (or lack thereof) of God. Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has never been very good at addressing such tough topics, particularly not in blockbuster movies like this one. Mainstream Hollywood also isn't that good at doing sex scenes, which is another big problem when you're adapting a sexy book.

With most of the novel's philosophy hacked out, and the sensuality toned down, ""Interview with the Vampire"" ends up being a movie with not much to say, and not much reason to exist. Sure, the movie makes a few short forays into philosophical territory, but I think it's fair to say that 90-95% of the book's thoughtful content is absent. Also missing are a couple of my favorite sequences from the book - namely, Louis' attempt to confess to a priest, and the creepy Eastern Europe segment with the revenant.

But even if I hadn't read the (far) superior book, I still think I would've disliked this movie. At least half of the cast is all wrong, for example. Brad Pitt gives an awful, lethargic performance as Louis (no, introspective characters don't have to be so dull), and Antonio Banderas is positively cheesy as Armand. Fortunately, Kirsten Dunst and the not-at-all-miscast Tom Cruise lend considerable energy to the film, capturing the essence of their characters far more successfully than Pitt.

On the plus side, the film is very lavish, with beautiful sets and costumes and a suitably eerie music score. The makeup is also awesome, and there is a refreshing lack of stupid digital effects (which, of course, have completely taken over all contemporary ""event"" movies). With all the impressive attention to detail on display, I'm surprised that the filmmakers got so much of the substance wrong.

Honestly, I'm also surprised to see so many positive reviews of this film, particularly coming from fans of Rice. If you think that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is only about *depressed vampires*, then this is the movie adaptation for you. But, as I said above, I think the novel is really about the search for morality and meaning in human life ... the bored vampires are just window-dressing for Rice's exploration of big philosophical issues. In the absence of those issues, all this movie can provide is shot after shot of vampires in frilly shirts biting ladies' wrists...",1316044800,4,2634,4.936794582392777
92918,5,0790729687,"5 stars out of 5 = Masterpiece

Elegant, sophisticated, beautifully scripted, acted, paced, & filmed, ""Interview with the Vampire"" is among my top five favorite Vampire movies. No other Vampire film, other than Gary Oldman's Oscar worthy performance in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" delves as deep in a character study of Vampires & how it would be like to be a Vampire from their point of view.

A broad 200 year perspective of the life of Brad Pitts Vampire character, ""Louie,"" the reluctant Vampire who finally succumbs to his fate of feeding on human blood, & in his quest for enlightenment of what he is, he finds out, if anything, he is a Vampire.

The story of a surprisingly great performance of Tom Cruise's, ""Lestat,"" who sees ""the dark gift"" as everything he could ever want, except companionship, what he wants the most, & realizes the least. Cruise steals the show in his glee for sucking the blood out of the living, & his indignation for turning ""Louie"" in to a Vampire that still has respect for human life, in a barrage of cold blooded murders, & ranting at ""Louie"" with black comedic hilarity, yet shocking indifference to life, to the point of sadomasochism . Also, a very young Kristen Dunst's, ""Claudia"", who also steals the show & matches Lestat bite for bite in the quest for blood, & the sport it brings. A hugely great & complicated performance for such a young girl!

""Interview with the Vampire"" is a thinking man's horror film, one that reaches down deep, not just to bring you cheap scares & shallow predictable characters, but a rich tapestry of what it means to be a Vampire, & all the consequences that goes with it.",1315267200,56,1643,4.674740484429066
92919,5,0790729687,This was the movie that set me on my current path of vampire fanatic. I first saw it when I was about 10 or 11 and read the book shortly thereafter. It's beautifully shot with a lot of special effects that could go seemingly unnoticed if you didn't know where to look because they blended so well with the actual sets and props. This is probably one of the best book to movie adaptations I've seen and it's all because Anne Rice wrote the script. She was able to have complete freedom in what was and was not included.

Such as, greed, lust, regret, sorrow, love, passion, and much more. This movie surprised me mainly because it was so different from what I thought it would be.

We discussed who we thought would make the best Lestat, and I thought David Bowie (as he was in Labrynth) or Julian Sands in ""Boxing Helena"" & another tragic vampire movie of which I have forgotten the name. We waited in anticipation, with bated breath and when we heard Tom Cruise was cast as Lestat we couldn't have been more disappointed!!!! In Rice's book, Lestat was tall, slender, with an aquiline nose and an attitude of brooding over life. Cruise couldn't be more opposite of this literary character.
He was much too short, had the wrong attitude, and when viewing it, I kept thinnking ""there's Maverick, wheres Goose?"". The wonderfull book did not make it on film with the cast although Brad Pitt as Louie was PERFECT. WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED AND ONLY WATCHED IT ONCE, AND THAT WAS ONCE TOO MUCH.

92957,2,0790729687,"I lasted for about 1/2 hour and gave up despite the good acting - this was arguably the best act i've seen Cruise deliver, ever (hmmm...food for thought). The sentimentality, the pathos, the Weltschmerz, the decadent male-on-male vibe are so kitchy, cliche-y and predictable that i was about to gag. Seriously - what about Rice makes people so impressed? She may be a bit more mature than the cute and vapid Stephanie Meyers but still - aren't we talking Much Ado about Nothing here? Isn't vamp gothery simply an inability to relate and communicate with fellow members of the species, an art form designed for teenagers in sexual overdrive without the erotic know-how?

Yeah, i guess this is it - a whiff of danger (ooooh - lookit, blood), a simulacrum of eros, a dollop of sentimentality and socially acceptable queerdom and we get the 21st century hipster swooning like a 19th century matron enthralled by Chopin (oooh - Frederic, encore une fois...). Is the vampire a simple metaphor for the unlived disconnected adolescent pining for real flesh and blood? Or is it the dream product of a frustrated woman yearning for her dark knight who will, finally, take her soul?  Yes it's a sad culture we live in, disconnected from feelings & from vitality ... instead of facing ourselves we tune into cheap spine shiverings crafted by unfulfilled  matrons dreaming up their incubi (incubuses?).

92958,4,0790729687,"This is one of my favorite films. I saw it before I read the book & was mesmerized. I read the novel at age 17, & instantly became a fan of Anne Rice. As has been addressed by many reviews & critics, the movie differs from the book in several ways, of which the first is that in the film the protagonist, Louis, states he has lost his wife & baby in childbirth, whereas in the book he felt responsible for the death of his brother. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but his performance as the vampire Lestat was worthy of an acting award, & he certainly changed my mind that he could BE this character. I know my next comment won't be popular, but I think Brad Pitt's nonverbal acting as Louis was often more striking, powerful, & poignant than his dialogue. I know Louis is supposed to be despairing & disillusioned, but I'm sorry, I've always found much of Brad Pitt's verbal delivery flatlined & mediocre. Kirsten Dunst as Claudia the ""woman-child"" vampire imprisoned in her child's body for the rest of her existence while she mentally & emotionally matures, is haunting, stunning & unforgettable, which explains why she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Christian Slater gives a strong portrayal as the interviewer Daniel, and although Antonio Banderas does not fit the original character of Armand in the books (who is supposed to be a Russian auburn-haired 17-year old), Antonio is sinisterly captivating.
As a kind of footnote, Neil Jordan, the director, & the many other talented people involved with the production of IWTV did a remarkable job with the costumes, special effects, and the sets: one of the most memorable is the catacombs where the Theater of the Vampires (Theatre des Vampires) live in Paris. If you listen to Neil's dvd commentary about the making of this, you learn they really did shoot scenes in Paris when Louis & Claudia travel to Europe seeking other vampires. Elliot Goldenthal's emotive musical score also intensely adds to the atmosphere, & deserved the Oscar nomination he received. I now just wish that Neil Jordan or another visionary, daring director would make The Vampire Lestat, or remake a worthy version of Queen of the Damned more closely resembling Anne Rice's book.",1289606400,3,2242,4.780927835051546

92980,5,0790729687,"Perhaps it's a bit curious that my favorite book is also my favorite movie, such is the case with Interview with the Vampire, and I've wondered whether my love for the story and the themes I connect with so much made me miss some faults with the movie. But the more I re-watch it, the more I am convinced it is a genuine masterpiece that deserves much more recognition than it gets.

 From the cinematography to the acting, everything is spectacular. The establishing shot of the San Francisco bridge with the modern city glittering in the background to the music of ""Libera Me"" is one of the most haunting and beautiful movie intros I have ever seen. I think the film, even though it has both major and minor differences from the novel, is so successful because it manages to bring to life the style of the novel. Some plots are skipped or shortened in order to fit into the two hour limit, but the frame lingers on precisely those subtle moments that matter most. Louis watching his final sunset, the tear that drops on his hand when he remembers Claudia, his resignation to having lost his ""last breath of humanity"" on that balcony in Paris...this is what constitutes intelligent pacing, in my opinion.

 The acting is also extraordinary. Kirsten Dunst usually gets the most praise for her performance, as she should, as it's amazing how she handled the material at such a young age. But in my opinion, and I realize not all share it, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are incredible as well. Again, even with the minor differences, I felt that both actors were deeply in-tune with their characters, and gave the material full justice. I would be very surprised if they had not both read and mediated on the book thoroughly beforehand. As a film major, I think of myself as moderately knowledgeable about movies, yet I would struggle to name two more emotionally dedicated performances. It's very curious to me why they haven't worked together again, even just for the commercial success such a partnership would generate.

 If there are other film adaptations of the Chronicles, hopefully the same amount of commitment and understanding of the story will be involved. Queen of the Damned, even though there are a couple of things I liked about it, didn't even try to give justice to the books.",1288569600,3,2288,4.7075

93086,5,0790729687,"For those who are uninitiated your knowledge of Vampire Movies is in no way complete until you have seen the master of them all, Interview with the Vampire . It is the exception to every rule and the rule to every exception . Lush, powerful, poetically charged with emotion and overwhelming in its portrayal of what it means to have everything yet be left wanting by the sheer tedium of perpetuity & immortality - it is a movie that deservedly embodies the meaning of the word 'Epic', so often overused as a descriptive modifier yet very apt herein . There are films of its kind that achieve the status of Cruise Ship but 'Interview' is truly the only Oceanliner out there, the QM2 of its time and its kind . Heavy, calculating, intricately layed out - yet never resting for a moment in its potent ability to storytell . The first half of 'Interview' provides the interviewer (Christian Slater) with the poignant background of who Louis (Brad Pitt) is and where he came from, the arrival of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) who plays the protagonist human epicenter of the dynamics between the living and the undead, and LeStat (Tom Cruise) who has brought Louis and Claudia, unwillingly, into his world - from which only sunlight, beheading or fire can provide final escape . In the second half of 'Interview' we arrive in Paris circa 1870, Louis & Claudia searching for LeStat's maker and in so doing hoping to find out more about themselves and the knowledge of the dark gifts LeStat has denied them . What they find instead is Armand (Antonio Banderas), at four-hundred years of age he is the World's oldest living Vampire, Claudia & Louis will be torn asunder after crossing paths with the seductive one - Louis's existence will never be the same again . A gilded era guilty pleasure, frought with love, death, grief, betrayal et al . Breathtakingly filmed with a cinematography that renders everything else in this genre to be pale and anemic by comparison - Interview with the Vampire is the heavyweight, the masterpiece of all Vampire movies, in a league and a class of its own, it attains excellence despite the presence of Tom Cruise, introduces the world to an impressive and powerful little girl named Kirsten Dunst and showcases what Neil Jordan is capable of in a timeless classic that will never go out of style . A must have for any serious Vampire film lover and for every collection to be considered complete .",1246406400,,2419,4.7075471698113205

93122,4,0790729687,"A great film with problematic picture and sound quality on Blu-Ray. The source transfer for ""Interview with the Vampire"" has obviously not been re-done for Blu-Ray, and appears to be the same source transfer used for the older DVD edition of this film. Although the superior medium and capabilities of a 1080p Blu-Ray disc make this an upgraded way to view this material, the limitations of an aging source transfer abound and call attention to themselves. Detail is good in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows. Blacks are unstable and milky, and there is motion judder and blur of in motion detail in shadows. Skin tone and texture show the waxy effect of DNR (digital noise reduction). Grain appears to be tele-cine noise, more than actual grain in the original material. Bandwidth is moderate at about 15 mbs. The sound is mediocre with only a Dolby 5.1 48k mix provided. This is hard to understand, as a previous DVD edition of this film boasted a DTS sound track. All in all a better view than the DVD version. But only worth renting, or if it can be purchased used or on mark down at $10 or less. A fine film.

A lot of things play a factor, between the biggest which is type of film stock, camera, lenses, lighting. This movie was shot this way. What you are seeing is what was shot. It isn't because Warner is out to ""get you"". Trust me, they want to make consumers happy. They want good reviews so people will buy more of their products.

93207,5,0790729687,"When it was reported in the media that Tom Cruise was to play the lead part of Lestat, the legendary vampire, in Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"", the author herself was dead set against casting the famous movie star as her lead character.  However after seeing the completed version of the film, Rice revised her opinion of Cruise and pronounced the performance ""brilliant"".  This role, keep in mind, was passed over originally by Daniel Day Lewis and Jeremy Irons and in retrospect, they would've been too old to play the ever youthful Lestat so I think Cruise was an excellent choice.  Also excellent are Brad Pitt as the doomed Louis and a very young Kirsten Dunst as the little girl who never ages.  Neil Jordan, coming off his recent hit, ""The Crying Game"", also delivered with an involving psychological horror film of the first caliber. I am now renting this film in Blu-ray and will comment on its quality which is in debate by some of the customers here.  Nevertheless, Blu-ray or standard, this is a film worth seeing if you're a fan of the book or an Anne Rice.  I think Cruise is an under-rated actor who has also given brilliant performances in ""Born on the 4th of July"" and ""Magnolia"" but because of his good looks is often ignored (The Cary Grant fate!!) as Michael Caine has stated in an interview.  Let's hope he doesn't do too many action films and goes for the jugular in his future films!!",1226188800,,1418,4.603174603174603
93208,5,0790729687,"I can't even begin to explain how incredible this Spellbinding movie from Anne Rice is. I'm very glad she has written it. She has a very workable imagination. Anybody can join in to work with her.(almost.) Well, let's get with the cast of this movie,now we have: Tom Cruise as Lestat, Brad Pitt as the remorseful vampire, Louis, Kirsten Dunst as the precocious Claudia and Antonio Banderas as Armand. The movie starts with a character played by Christian Slater, readying his tape recorder,beginning to interview a...vampire. The human-like creature turns to him,revealing himself to be..Louis, Brad's character. He begins to tell his story from his P.O.V. When he was human, he had a wife who died of childbirth, his baby boy or girl never made it either. So, he was already ready for death. That's when a vampire named Lestat decided to answer his prayers. The first time he taken his blood,he asked him,has he had enough. The second time he taken his blood, he told him, "" I'm going to give you the choice,I've never had."" Lestat gave him another life, ETERNAL LIFE. And for that,Louis sees the last sunrise for himself. I gotta admit, Brad's character has never looked so handsome and beautiful before. What a sexy-looking vampire! Anyway, the vampire saying went, ""In order to survive, you must feed!"" Louis couldn't bring himself to feed on the blood of humans,leading Lestat to do all the killing. Louis always fed on the blood of poodles, chickens and rats. Lestat found it funny for some reason. When push came to shove, they had their arguments and petty disagreements,talking about survival and being a killer vampire vs. morality. Lestat knew that Louis didn't like the way of survival, but he didn't care. While feeling stressed out, Louis found a little girl named Claudia, with her dead mother. He held her tight and sucked her blood. Lestat found them and started laughing and dancing with the dead corpse,celebrating the triumph of Louis's first taste of human blood. Louis was very depressed with himself and ran off to a sewer drain. Later on, Lestat found him, and told him he had a surprise for him. He took Louis back home and found Claudia, lying on the bed. Louis thought he killed her, but she was half-dead in vampire limbo. So, Lestat gives her a taste of his blood from his cut, she drinks until he shouted enough, and Claudia is transformed to the point of looking like a curly-haired doll with a savage bloodthirst to match. So, without giving the whole movie away, they tried living together, but, being that Lestat's rules were too much, they turned on him and ran, thinking he's dead. Together, Louis and Claudia searched the world for vampires just like them. And they did. First, they found a vampire named Santiago and then a leader named Armand. Armand welcomes them into his theatre and his underground Lair. Claudia doesn't trust Armand and his crew,but Louis says he has no choice but to stay where they are. Meanwhile,he was looking for a new mentor. I believe he found it in Armand, the oldest vampire he never met until that very moment. There's something else that's bugging Claudia, she needs a mother figure. After Louis feeds on the woman, believing himself a heartless vampire,Claudia kisses him. Spolier Alert: If you've never seen this movie and don't want the ending given away,then please read no further! Needless to say Armand's theartre troupe vampires including Santiago turn on Louis,Claudia, and for no real reason the woman 'cause they read their thoughts about they're incident between them and Lestat. So they wall up Louis to put him out of the way, and then they throw Claudia and the woman in a room where the sun comes through over-head. Sadly they both die ""burnt to a crisp"" with Louis unable to help them. So enraged about what had happened Louis seeks vengance by slicing up and burning those evil theatre troupe vampires. After that Louis not only decides that he was only going to get the worst end of the deal staying with Armand but also dubbed himself as ""self-sufficient. After that, he could deal with light, he seen Lestat for the last time,told the ending to Christian's character to publish and also told him that he doesn't want eternal life. When Christian's character drives off into the dawn, Lestat scares him by surprise and takes his blood. He drives the car, listens to the tape and says to him, ""I'm going to give you the choice,I never had.""

93234,1,0790729687,"I just watched this film for the umpteenth time on DVD and haven't tired of it one bit. Never one to be easily impressed by a film or won over by gore or special effects, my love of this particular film is rather deep.  To start with Neil Jordan is a marvellous director, who has brought us such classics as The Company of Wolves, The Crying Game and The Butcher Boy. This man is a genius of vision and brings out the most honest performances from his cast. I don't think that we will ever see a better performance from any of the actors. It was, unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst's zenith of credibility at such a young age, nothing that she has done since has come close to her brilliantly painful, evocative performance here as the tortured Claudia. Nor is it likely that Brad Pitt's morose Louis will be outdone with any of his other roles (nay, I think Louis even outdoes Pitt's portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys). And Tom Cruise has never been so powerful in a role. All three bring wonderfully nuanced subtlties to their roles as the vampire trio and it is enormously compelling and emotionally touching to watch them on their journey.  Every detail of this film, from Philippe Rousselot's award-winning cinematography to the wonderfully detailed art direction and Stan WInston's always reliable makeup and effects, are exceptionally created and add to the brooding mood of this film. Without Elliot Goldenthal's sombre, beautiful score which was shamelessly beaten at the oscar's by Hans Zimmer's score from THe Lion King, the film would been very different. The moving string and choral melodies and horns provide such a marvellous atmosphere.  The story itself is so heart-breaking and involving. If you let yourself into the world of the vampire (which is rather accessible through the afforementioned cinematic techniques) Interview with the Vampire proves to be a beguiling and unique experience. It is a soaring emotional journey, a quest to not only find the meaning of immortal life, but the very reason for existence.  I am greatly moved and satisfied by Interview with the Vampire each time I watch it. It is a great shame that the sequels (which were obviously originally planned to follow on closely from this film - or so the ending suggests) were not handled by the same crew. Queen of the Dammed (actually the third book in the Vampire CHronicles - they skipped The Vampire Lestat) is rather pitiful and lacks the depth and intelligence of Interview with the Vampire. Hopefully if others are to be made, Neil Jordan, or someone at his level, will take the helm. If not, at least we are left with this beautiful film, for there is no other vampire film quite like it.",1222560000,2,2692,4.7827956989247316

93236,5,0790729687,"""Interview With A Vampire"" makes ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" look like a joke.  This is how a vampire movie should be done.  This film puts you into the mystical world of vampires, you feel like your living in it.  The acting is fantastic all across the board.  The sets and the costumes are beautiful as well.  Even ""Queen of the Damned"" couldn't repeat the same type of magic of ""Interview With A Vampire"".  This is a special film and has stood the test of time.",1221350400,,460,4.416666666666667
93237,1,0790729687,"What to say about this movie except that I almost started laughing after a while.

When this movie first came out, it was really scary for its time.

My, how things have changed.  ""Dark Knight"" was scarier than this movie, and it only got a PG-13 rating.

Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are really, really bad, just awful, oomph, kick in the gut, laughably bad actors in this movie.  Now, they've been good in some other roles, but seriously, they just don't have the chops to play 200 year old vampires right.

Antonio Banderas in mascara makeup!  What a riot!  And all that pancake mix on all of these actors' faces...snicker....

Ooooh....overt homoerotic man-loves-boy themes!  Pretty exotic stuff for its time (1994), now just awfully silly, not to mention something that is both out in the  open AND severely criminalized in our current wacky society.  Today, 14 years later, we would see Lestat just surf the Net and/or join NAMBLA...and then get busted in a Special Report on NBC ""Dateline"".

The worst aspect of this movie had to be the soundtrack - WOW, it's like they tried to score this movie like one of those melodramatic horror flicks from the 1950's...unbelievably bad musical score - it turned every scary moment into a farce...

Kirsten Dunst, what a prodigy!  She was only 12 years old when this movie came out, and... strangely enough, she talks...and acts... exactly...the same way...still.  It's as if she never was a child....  Hmmmmm....",1217894400,7,1455,4.825910931174089
93238,5,0790729687,"I read the book before seeing the movie.
It seemed to capture the essence of the book.
And it did.
Well, Tom Cruise had to hetero up the character.
Otherwise he did a phenomenal job of bringing Lestat to life.
A brilliant movie, great acting all around, great music, very well paced.
A must see for horror fans.
A movie that finally outdoes the book.
And now I have to rant on Cruse for a minute.
I remember when this movie came out and all the HEAT he took from people for doing this movie.
It's too dark, it's too scary, it's too...........BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!!!!!!
I wish Tom's core audience would shut up and let him do his thing.
I was and still am SOOOOOOOOOO tired of seeing Cruise in his usual ""Top Gun"" role.
Interview finally proved the guy can act, REALLY act.
And he took so much crap from his core audience of straight women in their 40's for not doing his usual dumbed down romance role.
GIVE IT UP!!!
Have any of you noticed he's never done a role NEARLY as risky as this one since then?
It's his career and his life people, let him live it the way HE wants.
The vampire Cruise NEVER would have committed that couch jumping episode years later on Oprah.
Go back to your risky roles Tom, you deserve better than a bunch of screaming post teen women telling you how to run your life.
Interview???
Oh yeah, Interview With The Vampire.......
The single most brilliant Vampire movie Hollyweird has ever produced.
Highly recommended.",1214179200,2,1441,4.462121212121212
93239,5,0790729687,"I first was introduced to this movie when I was 13, and it still haunts me today.  I read the book two years later, and suprisingly, I love both just as much!  I was also glad that Anne Rice that did the screenplay, since not a lot of authors get that chance.  By her doing that, she brought what she wrote to life instead of someone else.

Tom Cruise: Best performance I've ever seen, since he's very diverse in his career. I haven't looked at him the same way since, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  Very chilling, likeable and sexy!

Brad Pitt: Another great performance of Louis! I love the humanity still portrayed after he's turned, and adds a bit of light to the film.

Kirsten Dunst: Scared the life out of me!  Just as scary, and sick, as in the novel.  She touches the surface of her love for Louis, which made her such a great performer.

Antonio Banderas: In the book, Armand is much younger, but hey when you get someone sexy like Banderas, you can't complain!  Just the way he looks at the characters makes you wish you weren't really there.

Another thing I absolutely loved was the dark, beautiful soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal.  That is one any vampire lover must have in their music library.  The opening song sucks you right in until the very end.  But one thing I didn't like, since I'm religious, was the nudity and torture to the girl on the stage.  It was in the novel, and I'm glad they stayed faithful to it, but it was hard to watch.  But otherwise, the blood and dark atmosphere was amazing to watch.  This is highly recommended, you won't regret it!",1213142400,,1583,4.418685121107266
93270,4,0790729687,"This was a great movie but it's missing a lot of key elements from the book. It's been a while since I've read the book so one of the only things I can remember is that when Lestat turns Louis in the movie it was Fast and on the docks. In the book Louis was dying from some sort of sickness. Lestat showed up in his room and asked ""I can make it all go away."" Lestat planned it out because he watched Louis and knew that he'd have a safe place to stay during the night if he turned Louis into a creature of the night. One other was when they got the Nanny in the movie she died within 1 or 2 nights. In the book it was like 1 or 2 weeks. All in all it's a good movie. But it lacks the intense story of the book.",1212105600,,711,3.7152317880794703
93271,5,0790729687,"Having only read Anne Rice's fantastic novel after watching the movie, I had none of the expectations for this film that plagued the moviegoers who'd already fallen in love with the character of Louis, the vampire constantly at war with his own emotions.  I first saw this film at a younger age, sometime around 13 years old.  It had a profound impact on me then, as I had never had much chance to watch even PG-13 movies per my parents' authoritative rule over the content which reached me.  However, I was able, at times, to find ways in which to view films beyond their reach.  Many of these films I had to get from my older brother without his knowledge; films he adored and was able to purchase without my parents' intervention at 16 years of age.  Interview With The Vampire was one such film, and being such, it had already given itself to me as something special, considering its procurement as something of a long, drawn-out chore.  After viewing it several times over the course of a year, I had committed it to the topmost place in my list of favorite movies.

From the opening credits, I was enthralled.  Every milestone in Louis' life, every mistake he makes, every pang of guilt he feels captivated my interest.  It was at this point in my life that I'd decided Brad Pitt was my favorite actor (since supplanted years later by Johnny Depp), as he conveyed some of the most complex emotions I'd yet seen on film.  The dark undertones of Lestat and Louis' tenuous friendship sent chills through my spine.  Claudia's predicament, eternally trapped in the body of a six-year-old, beautifully portrayed by Kirstin Dunst, was as believable as anything I'd ever known, enhanced to a large degree by Elliot Goldenthal's mesmerizing score.  The film sparked my thoughts about the depths of human emotion, and what it truly feels like to be alone.  I believe it was quite influential in my development as a young teenager, and I am glad that what I took away from it was its philosophical ponderings, rather than the neo-gothic stylings some of my contemporaries decided to mold themselves to.

All in all, I recommend this movie very highly.  See it, enjoy it; if not for its action or drama, then for its music and philosophical value.  Anyone should be able to find something of value in Neil Jordan's cinematic masterpiece.",1210636800,,2331,4.704433497536946
93272,5,0790729687,"It wasn't 100% like the book, but it was still a great book. All the actors did a fantastic job and the scenes themselves even looked nice.",1206748800,,139,4.185185185185185

93274,5,0790729687,"If anyone has actually read the book, you will know that though not 100% accurate, Tom Cruise does Lestat like no one ever could. I saw the film before ever picking up an Anne Rice novel. This was back in 94 I think. But I loved the movie anyway. It was so different, I literally couldn't get it out of my mind. So I decided to read the book, and I was even more amazed. But the one thing that really got me was that Lestat is exactly like I pictured he would be; Like Tom Cruise made him. Brad Pitt, unfortunetly, wasn't how I pictured him in the book. But, his beautifully sad performance made it only a minor point. This movie is beautiful and seductive. It is unlike any other vampire movie out there, even today. To think, Vampires actually conversing and mingling seamlessly with mortals, without a care in the world and without raising suspicions. What a novel concept! There is no real gore or bloodbaths here. The kills are almost sexual or desperate. Kirsten Dunst embodied Claudia, the little child vampire spawn. She is wickedly perfect here. Even Antonio Banderas as Armand in a short role was perfection(Though he was way too old for the part, again didn't matter). Anne Rice has created this wonderfully visual environment and it is perfectly realized in this movie.",1202256000,,1281,4.598253275109171
93275,4,0790729687,"I've never seen this film although my daughter has insisted I would like it. Since I don't like Tom Cruise, I was not inclined to watch it. But since I do like Brad Pitt and think he is a much better actor, I finally broke down and watched it..I wonder why I waited so long...Brad Pitt didn't let me down..he was THE star...Great Movie..and I'm glad i got it from Amazon..it arrived pretty fast considering I ordered it around the holidays..",1201478400,,441,4.45679012345679

93277,5,0790729687,This movie is a pretty good vampire movie. Even though it was from the 90's I think they did a good job with it. Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Louis and Tom Cruise did decently with his role as Lestat.

93279,4,0790729687,"Ah yes, who could forget back when Cruise still had integrity and Brad was just a sparkle in everyone's eye? There were many who frowned upon Tom as the devilishly debonair Lestat, the vampire you love to hate and hate to love; but Cruise managed to pull it off in grand style. While the movie strays rather far from the book, watching Cruise and Pitt on the big screen as lusty blood suckers is a delight. The Good - the ""buddy"" chemistry between principal actors, The Bad - Straying too far from the original work, The Ugly - dancing with corpses - eeeew!",1196899200,,557,4.41747572815534

93303,3,0790729687,"Let's get this straight. Vampires aren't afraid of garlic?  Aren't killed by wooden stakes? Can just be killed by slicing them in half? Cry, and feel bad about being vampires? Don't recognize the famous Count? Don't need their own home soil to sleep in? Actually, straight isn't the word for this version. Perhaps it was a fatal disadvantage not having heard of Anne Rice before slipping this disc in the slot, but I was puzzled. Presumably because I didn't know what to expect, and am not into the vampire culture of today.  It seemed to me, though, that there were one or two interesting angles: like Hollywood is Vampire Town, not Tinsel Town. The plot, what I understood of it, was certainly very state-of-the-art modern. I'm not going to go into all the allegorical buddy-type psychology, which was all hanging well out anyway. Wishing again for Cushing and Lee dates me, I know, but they've spoiled me for any other vampire story, and I simply can't buy any of the updates and/or revisions. It made me think, now and then, but it also dragged; and I agree with those reviewers who thought Brad was just too pathetic and glum to make it work as entertainment. Great C18th scenery, costumes and so forth. Too serious, too deep, though. I've probably given it one star too many.",1192492800,,1281,4.688888888888889
93304,5,0790729687,"As much as I cannot stand Brad Pitt (Louis), I must admit Both he and Tom Cruise (Lestat) were outstanding in this movie. I will point out that fans of the book may be disappointed as significant changes have been made (most notably the homoeroticism that was the backbone of the book is seriously underplayed) but I still enjoyed the movie. It is important to point out the performance of Kirsten Dunst, at the age of 12, (Claudia) she establishes herself quite strongly as a fantastic young actress. Christian Slater as the interviewer is equally great.
  Louis rather than choosing the death he desires makes the conscience decision to become a vampire joining forces with Lestat in what is obviously a ""partnership"". Unlike Louis, Lestat is unable to reconcile himself to everything involved in being a vampire and soon his erstwhile mortal morals begin to get the best of him much to the disdain of Lestat.
  This is a tale of love, desire, betrayal, lonliness, desperation and hunger.
  Seeking more, they become ""parents"" to a disillusioned child/vampire. Claudia brings a flash of innocence to the story while making it clear that she is deadly, a doll cuddling vampire that will forever remain a child. Louis and Claudia immediately form a bond (perhaps because of the loss of Louis' wife and child during childbirth). Slowly, deliberately, she drives a wedge between Louis and Lestat by taking Louis' love and attention away from Lestat. As can be imagined, the results are devastating.
 Free of Lestat, Louis and Claudia depart for Paris, where Louis seeks out other vampires ( he has no choice now but to go on). He comes upon Antonio Banderas (the vampire Armand), who quietly helps him, quite seductively I might add. Armand asks Louis to join him, to be by his side, to allow him to teach him (ok, homoeroticism is clearly evident here). There is a brief scene where the viewer is positive Louis is about to kiss Armand but the moment is lost.
  Anne Rice does a beautiful job with the screenplay (one would expect that since she is the author of the book). And even though she originally was against the casting of Tom Cruise, this statement was later recanted publicly after she saw his performance first-hand. She felt that he did do justice to the character she created.
  Cruise, Pitt, Dunst, Banderas and even Slater all performed superbly and derserve credit for a job well done.
  Alright, the dialogue does get a little cheesy at times and Brad Pitt underplays his character just a little. But, as vampire movies go, this is one of the best ever made. Director Neil Jordan gives us a dark, dramatic epic tale that is stunningly directed.
  I would highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in a great vampire movie or just a well written drama.",1190419200,,2776,4.790356394129979
93305,1,0790729687,"This has to be one of the silliest movies I've ever watched. It's about a vampire who doesn't like killing people. Also, he doesn't get along with his fellow vampires very well. There's no real plot. A complete waste of time, money, and talent.",1188777600,4,244,4.568181818181818
93306,5,0790729687,"Like witches before a cauldron, author Anne Rice and her minions chanted, ""Who shall play Lestat? Who shall play Lestat?"" Rice's incantation conjured up such names for the casting of this high-profile role as Alexander Godunov, Cher and Peter Weller, who probably had scheduling problems anyway doing films like THE NEW AGE and cable movies with actors like Robert Hays. Then, director Neil Jordan announced Tom Cruise would play the tall, blond European vampire -- it was as if he had uttered Richard Grieco -- and the realized film was reduced to an assessment of Cruise's Lestat. What everyone missed, while hanging on to Tom's every ""mon Dieu,"" was Jordan's ability to turn a novel with a flaccid film premise into something worth watching.

INTERVIEW is not the greatest idea for a movie -- the dozens of aborted screenplay attempts and the 17 years it took to finally reach the big screen are evidence enough -- because it's neither suspenseful nor scary. Because it is told through the eyes of a vampire, we are asked to identify with a predator. We stalk the helpless. We don't feel frightened, we feel guilty. The examination of a sourpuss lamenting his fate for two centuries may make for good reading, but the idea doesn't exactly put you at the edge of your seat. Vampire movies told through the eyes of the predator are best-suited for comedy, as in Love at First Bite -- well, maybe not best-suited -- or metaphor, as in The Hunger. So what about Interview? Jordan said, ""What fascinates me about [the film] is the absence of moral responsibility."" Well, he's hinting at the truth. For our money, Interview is about the torment of being a celebrity.

Brad Pitt says, ""I'm flesh and blood, but not human."" Pick a star, any star. Christian Bale? Nicolas Cage? Flesh and blood, sure. But human? Pitt's tale reads as that of a celebrity thrust into the limelight searching for the secrets of how to be a headliner. Cruise, the biggest superstar in town, chose Pitt as his lifetime co-star -- for his beauty? Definitely. Because he owns a sprawling plantation? Couldn't hurt. The pretty boys live the high life, but Pitt can't snip his ties to the little people and so resorts to common junk food binges. If Cruise has any tricks on handling fame, he's sure as hell not sharing them with the whiny, I-don't-want-to-be-a-star Pitt; so he figures to shut him up by biting him a gift -- child actor Kirsten Dunst. This is Cruise's fatal mistake, for he should know better than to have a kid for a co-star. Just ask W.C. Fields or anyone who had to share screen time with Macaulay Culkin.

As with most child stars, Dunst's fans won't let her grow up. When she lops off her trademark locks in hopes of changing her image, those precious curly Q's just grow back -- Shirley Temple forever. This clearly explains why Zac Efron won't be seen in NATURAL BORN KILLERS II anytime soon. But then Dunst does what child stars do best: she upstages the headliner. With Cruise out of the spotlight, Pitt is forced to carry the burden of fame on his own. He decides he needs guidance. So why not go to Paris?

In Paris, Pitt finds his counselor in the form of Antonio Banderas, who appears to have been a big deal in his day but now hosts a lame television show -- metaphorically speaking, of course. Banderas tells Pitt, ""You have to be powerful, beautiful and have no regrets."" (Is he referring to Sharon Stone?) Being a show-biz veteran, Banderas has the good sense to can the child actor, cancel the TV show and jump-start his career with the new hot star, Pitt. Although coming very close to kissing Banderas, Pitt won't have this has-been riding his coattails. So, he's off yet again, this time to America.

Back home, Pitt catches a foul aroma only celebrities can smell -- the scent of a dead career. He follows the stench to find Cruise in the Jon Voight Home of Former Leading Men. Cruise pathetically recalls his salad days, forcing Pitt to flee because failed stardom is catchy. Still somewhat of an ingenue when it comes to fame management, Pitt fails to take into account the possibility of the ever-elusive comeback. Too bad Travolta wasn't around to tip him off. Interview ends on the hopeful note that anyone can return to glory once more -- Kevin Costner, Burt Reynolds, The Two Coreys... (well, maybe not anyone.)

While there are plenty of films about celebrities -- Sunset Boulevard, A Star Is Born -- none get deeper in the skin, or more inside the head, of the immortal superstar than Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.",1188777600,,4537,4.679197994987469

Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with you just cuz you suffer from some disgusting disease. But back to the blonde, and this is my only gripe: Couldn't they have just filmed all her scenes after she recovered from the pneumonia or whatever respiratory condition had made her sound like a butch mule?

He captured every last detail of Lestat's nature right down to a pleading gaze when he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' to a character he wronged terribly. I love this movie totally and absolutely and to me the shining star of this production was Tom Cruise and his thorough and ideal portrayal of the literary super star- Lestat de Lioncourt.",1186704000,,761,4.7293233082706765
93309,5,0790729687,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is an accurate interpretation of the book to say the least. All of actors did a wonderful job interpreting the characters.,1186704000,,172,4.40625
93340,5,0790729687,"It's no exaggeration.

A careful observation of previous reviews will show that I labeled Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" as the vampire masterpiece, and I stand by that, as far as books go; however, comparing ""Interview"" the movie with Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (or other, infinitely worse, adaptations) is an entirely different goblet of blood. This is due, in part, to the fact the ""Dracula"" is just more suited to reading. But it's also true that Rice wrote one monster of a story that Neil Jordan absolutely nailed on film, and that Tom Cruise was incredible as Lestat.

Interestingly, Rice initially objected to the casting of Cruise, preferring someone more like Rutger Hauer in his youth. She recanted after she saw the movie--and so did I, having harbored similar ""Top Gun""-based misgivings. And so did the academy, nominating Cruise for a well-merited Oscar that he should have won. It's as though, in defiance of all common sense, a film was carried by its least-likely leading man.

Others are terrific as well, including Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, and Antonio Bandaras--but Lestat, as delivered by Cruise, does the difficult trick: that is, he becomes the sympathetic character, the one we relate to, when he has no conscience about killing whatever. We begin to feel contempt for Pitt's simpering vampire, thinking, ""You're a vampire, for crying out loud! Go suck someone's neck and shut up!""

And Neil Jordan was the perfect choice for director. Unlike others who came before him--several who did a decent job--Jordan never forgets that vampires are not simply COOL; they're scary as all get-out, and mystical, magical, and tragic. There's also a high degree of eroticism in the movie, but I've got to throw that back to Rice, the lord mistress of that genre ...

Brilliant!

93341,5,0790729687,"Interview with the Vampire is probably the most intelligent vampire movie ever made, and if not, then it is certainly my favourite because Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles have the most well rounded and complex vampire characters ever put to pen. Characters like Lestat, Louis or Armand are charismatic, flawed and mysterious and always engage the reader... or in the case of this film, the viewer. This is a compellingly romantic movie that draws one inevitably into its rich and colourful tapestry of two codependent vampire's journey through time. Anne Rice's vampires are unique, to become a vampire you have to be given ""the dark gift"" not just bitten by a vampire; they are not afraid of crucifixes or holy water, garlic does not affect them, and not even a stake through the heart will kill them... they are afraid only of the sun. I really like the fact that Anne Rice has dispensed with most simplistic traditional vampire lore; and that her bewitching creations are not as two dimensionally evil as Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, or those overly charactertured vampires seen in B Grade movies.

We first meet Louis (Brad Pitt) the narrator of this film in a sparsely decorated room in San Francisco, he is being interviewed by budding journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) who thinks he might be onto the story of his life. Louis was born in the late 18th Century as a southern plantation owner; he has just lost his beloved wife and child, and thus the will to live. One fateful night while out drunk in New Orleans he meets Lestat... and his life changes forever. Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him two choices: drink from me so you can live forever, or you can die... Louis having nothing to lose chooses to become an immortal. Unlike most vampires Louis stubbornly holds on to the last vestiges of his humanity, refusing to hunt people he feeds off animals. After burning down his plantation manor he and Lestat move into a stylish townhouse in New Orleans, where they set about creating a new life for themselves. Louis and Lestat have a love-hate relationship; for they spend most of their time together bickering, fighting and arguing. Louis thinks Lestat is arrogant and spoilt (indeed he is called the brat prince!) and Lestat thinks Louis is moralistic and sentimental, so to heal the rift between them Lestat ""adopts"" a little girl whose mother has died of the plague. To make a vampire so young is a grave offence in vampire culture; and if Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) is found by other vampires she will most certainly be killed, but Lestat gives her ""the dark gift"" anyway. At first this calculated ploy works; Louis is happy with their ""daughter"" but as Claudia matures and her body doesn't grow she begins to ask questions, and to ultimately resent and despise Lestat. She convinces Louis to help her murder Lestat and dump his inert body in the Louisiana swamps; they then flee to 19th Century Europe, however Lestat is not so easily killed. When they arrive in The Old World they begin their search for other vampires in earnest; and their journey takes them throughout Eastern Europe, but sadly they have no luck... finally after much fruitless searching they end up in Paris. One evening while Louis is wandering through the dark Paris streets he finally meets another vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) leader of a gothic vampire coven. Armand and his followers run The Theatre Des Vampires where they mount plays that mock and parody mortals, even though it is the mortal bourgeoisie that make up its unsuspecting audience. This encounter has tragic consequences for the pair; Armand falls in love with Louis and has Claudia and her new vampire nanny killed so that he can have Louis to himself, but his plan backfires. Stricken with grief Louis takes bloody revenge on the vampire coven, destroying their corrupt and decadent way of life forever. It is now the late 20th Century and Louis has returned to America; and finds himself back in his old hometown of New Orleans, he senses something in a dilapidated old building, enters and finds Lestat... alive but frail and scared, they talk all to briefly and then part ways again.

This beautiful, melancholy and sad film is one of those rare movies that is almost as good as the novel it was based on, I only wish it had been a little longer. The movie remains for the most part faithful to the book, for after all it was Anne Rice who wrote the screenplay. Sure Louis in the books has dark hair; Lestat (who was originally meant to be played by Julian Sands) is six foot tall, and Armand is an eternal teenager... but these are only minor quibbles that don't mar the film. And if you have ever seen the pretty average Queen of the Dammed, the lack lustre sequel, then you will realize what a truly wonderful film Neil Jordan has crafted. This highly romantic film is for me the ultimate chickflick with its hunky three lead actors, I mean they are all so broodingly handsome! So if you enjoyed Interview with the Vampire; I strongly urge you to begin exploring Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and New Tales of the Vampires, or even her Lives of the Mayfair Witches which is also set in the same parallel world of seductive vampires, ghosts and secret societies.

93342,5,0790729687,"I just want to go on record and say, this is my favorite movie of all time!  (Based on movies I have seen.)  I saw this movie when it was first released back in 1994, and being as young as I was, I didn't understand it.

Flash foward to now.  After buying and reading all of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, I was instantly heel-bent on getting my hands on a copy of this movie!  I was able to watch it again, and I must say I believe this movie is a true work of art, and an instant classic.

The adaptation from the novel to the on-screen story is changed ever so slightly (omitting some parts as most book-to-movies often do) but keeps the whole thing flowing seemlessly together, while also maintaining the substance the viewer needs to fully appreciate the film.

The acting is beyond amazing.  Many people called into question Tom Cruise playing the character of Lestat (I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan either) but I can honestly say he did an amazing job with such an important role.  Having Brad Pitt play alongside Cruise as the character of Louie only caused Cruise to step his game up as well.  Pitt was still fairly young in this movie and he shows a dark energy about him that gelled naturally with the movie.

Who can forget the young Kirsten Dunst, as the loveable and innocent Claudia!  A break-out role for the (at the time) young star that propelled her to future A-list status.  (What if Leelee Sobieski had gotten the part?)  Dunst plays her role so well, you do actually forget that she is just a child in the movie!  Add the incredible acting by Antonio Banderas, and you do have a young all-star cast!

The story itself remains true to the novel.  A tale of lonliness, friendship, immortality, loss, grief, and acceptance.  This movie never over-does the story to make it more ""Hollywood,"" they just seem to let the movie take a course of its own and let the characters do the story-telling.  This movie will leave you with many questions, as well as a feeling that everything is settled and the end course has been set.

This movie is well worth every penny you spend to rent or buy it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this movie for any and all movie fans!  A true 5-star classic.",1180828800,,2205,4.432835820895522
93343,5,0790729687,"Anne Rice created the modern vampire with her novel, and the movie did it justice. Brad Pitt is definitely what makes the movie, he plays the role of the depressed vampire Louis perfectly. This the movie also has the very young Kirsten Dunst playing the role of Claudia, and she is an amazing actress for one her age at the time. The overall film is just perfect, from location to wardrobe, it feels like a trip through time. It's just a shame that the second movie wasn't as good as this movie.

93344,5,0790729687,"""Interview with the Vampire"" is bar none, one of the best vampire films ever made. Based on the first novel in The Vampire Chronicles, by Anne Rice...Interview is directed by Oscar winner Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game') and scripted by Rice herself. I remember the first time I saw this movie, 6 years ago, and immediately reading the first book. Not only is it a great vampire film, but it's also a terrific literary adaptation. Rice only removed things from the novel that weren't completely necessary and, in doing so, created a brilliant, passionate script. The film stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, and Christian Slater. Seeing these names doesn't really shout ""masterpiece."" Incredibly, every actor is suited very well for their role.

The film opens in modern day New Orleans, where a vampire named Louis (Pitt) has agreed to give a reporter (Slater) an interview. The story then jumps back to the late 1700's, where Louis was a 24-year-old, suicidal plantation owner who had recently lost his wife and child in childbirth. His invitation to death is open to anyone, but it is Lestat (Cruise) who accepts his offer. Lestat kills Louis and, before he dies, offers him the chance to live forever. Louis accepts. This offer means that Louis will live forever and stay eternally youthful, but must stay away from sunlight and must feast on the blood of others. Unable to take the lives of humans (something Lestat does with ease), Louis begins feasting on rats and other animals; When Louis ends up taking the life of a young girl, Lestat turns her into a vampire and she becomes Claudia (Dunst), the daughter/lover of Louis and Lestat. Louis and Claudia become a kind of Romeo & Juliet type, but they remain complete opposites. Claudia is more like Lestat, deadly and cruel...Odd, since she hates Lestat. Jumping ahead a bit, Louis and Claudia eventually end up in Europe where they meet Armand (Banderas), the self-proclaimed ""oldest living vampire"" and head of a theatre troupe called The Theatre de Vampyre. I don't want to say much more about the plot to avoid spoilers. When Cruise was cast as Lestat, Rice publicly critisized the decision but later recanted her comments when she saw the film. On the DVD, in the bonus features, she rants about how good Cruise was. And he is incredible, this is one of his best performances. I've only read the first book (I'm currently reading ""The Vampire Lestat""), but Cruise captures this character so well. He's charismatic, good-looking, but capable of being cruel and evil as well. Pitt delivers one of his best performances too as Louis. Louis is a complex character, who needs to a complex performance to really capture him. Pitt handled that completely; Watch his eyes throughout the film and watch how they go from young and youthful to world weary and sad. Dunst, who was thirteen when she made the film (I think), also delivers a spectacular performance. Since the character begins as a child and, by the end of the film, is still a child but with an adult mind; Dunst showed incredibly maturity in the role. Few child actors could have captured the emotion she did. I can not rave enough about this movie. Vampire/Dracula movies are the most cliched and overly used stories out there, but ""Interview with the Vampire"" is bursting with originality. It's not a horror film, despite it's subject matter. It's really a drama and much of Louis's story is heartbreaking. The gothic look that Jordan gave the film works very well to set the tone and atmosphere of the film. Even if you're a person who despises horror films or movies about vampires, I highly recommend this movie.

Brad Pitt has his work cut out for him making a whiny character like Louis into a likeable sympathetic hero, but just about pulls it off. Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as their daughter, but the star of the show is probably (and surprisingly) Antonio Banderas who is superbly convincing in his part, hinting that he could have been a far more respected actor than he gets credit for these days. Admirable support is provided by Stephen Rea and a slightly underused Christian Slater in what is a wonderfully moody and dark tale.

93374,5,0790729687,"Interview with a vampire was a amazing movie to say the least.

I saw this movie shortly after it come to video only because I was kind of busy giving birth to see it at the theaters lol.

I must say I did not read the book until after I saw the movie,but the movie was the reason I started to read her books on vampires.

I was surprised after reading the book how closely Neil Jorden tried to stick to Ann's story. It's a rare thing for hollywood to stick closely to the authors story.

Another thing that amazed me was how good Tom Cruze and Brad Pitt where in the movie. Like a lot of people I thought Tom would not be cut out to play such a dark role and Brad well I did not really have a thought on him at the time. Brad shows such depth in the role of Louis the vampire of regret and sorrow for all things pasted. And Tom really did surprise the hell out me and after reading the book I felt he kept true to the feel of Lesta.  One thing I can say that will blow you away about this movie is Claudia played by Kristin Dunst, a young vamp like maybe the age of 10 when Lesta turned her. Cursed to remain forever the child. Given that the matter of this movie is dark and not really a movie you would normaly think of a child playing a role in it. After all we all grew up thinking vamps were growning ups. Any way Claudia was a prowerful character and I think Kristin at times out shined even Brad and Tom's characters. You had no problem believeing she was a vamp and that this was a first for her to play. She played it well and held her own in this movie.

  Really ladies and Gents this is a good movie and its just a shame Hollywood and Ann could not have gotten Neil Jorden to direct the last vampire movie Ann let hollywood do. If she had the last one would of been so much better.",1154822400,3,1794,3.963888888888889
93375,5,0790729687,"`Interview With The Vampire' released in '94 is the highly anticipated film adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel of the same title. This is definitely a cerebral tale for the true connoisseur of the supernatural. Yes, there is more than enough blood and dismemberment to satisfy the most ardent horror fan, but there is also so much more. Never before have we seen the mind and (dare I say) soul of a vampire so deeply examined. Never before has the emotional anxiety, mental pain and eternal agony of the damned been so thoroughly laid bare and available for scrutiny by their uninitiated mortal prey.

Masterfully directed by Neil Jordan, the film perfectly captures the gothic atmosphere, macabre romanticism and melancholy undertones of the vampiric twilight world as found in Rice's book and subsequent screenplay.

Add to this visual masterpiece and well-conceived storyline a superb cast featuring the very best of the undead; Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kristen Dunst and Antonio Banderas we find ourselves on the verge of a whole new genre of intelligent horror films.

I thought Brad, Tom, Antonio, made a great blood sucking team.  Kristin Dunst did a job well done for her first bite, on film.  She pulled it off so well, that she freaked me out the first time I saw her in it. The setting in New Orleans, and the farm, was setting the mood right. The cemitery scenes were, really creepy.

93379,5,0790729687,"This movie is as good as they come. You got Tom Cruise in his best performance ever (it rivals his performance in Magnolia, but I think he's slightly better in Interview), and then you have Brad Pitt being just as good as Tom. Kirsten Dunst, however, is the most impressive talent in this movie. At such a young age, and lacking the experience of both Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, regardless, she's in league with them throughout the entire movie (and perhaps outperforms them?). Antonio Banderas is also impressive. He may not look like Armand did in the novel (Armand looks like a boy, with auburn hair), but I think it's fair to say that this is the best acting performance I've seen from Antonio Banderas so far. Indra Ove gives us all one very memorable performance as a New Orleans prostitue (she's an underrated actress, and deserves more success because of her talent; I think she should be featured in more professional movies like this one).

The soundtrack composed by Elliot Goldenthal, is in perfect harmony with the settings, the characters, the events, and the entire timeline of this movie. Church choir in Latin is absolutely beautiful. I especially liked the ""Sympathy for the Devil"" cover at the end (Guns N' Roses, what a band).

This is one of my favourite movies of all time, and much of that is thanks to Anne Rice. She wrote the novel which this movie is based upon, and she also wrote the screenplay. I think she has a very unique beauty with words, and the English language in itself. I think she's the best author we have today, because she puts her heart and soul into her books. And that's something many authors fail to do (at least not as good as Anne Rice). I also love her ""writer's voice."" It sounds very professional when you read her books.

Everyone in this movie deserves an Oscar--especially Anne for best screenplay.

I've read the novel, and I think it's fair to say that this is one of the few movies out there, which is actually better than the book (not that there's anything wrong with the novel).

93410,4,0790729687,"Interview with the Vampire, based on the book by Anne Rice, seems to constantly meet itself halfway, resulting in a movie that some will love and some will hate. The movie begins with Daniel Malloy, played by Christian Slater, sitting down to an all night interview with 200 year old vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac, played by Brad Pitt. The story is conveyed in the form of a flashback, with Louis narrating to Daniel as the story unfolds on the screen. Louis, who has lost the will to live due to the decease of his wife and child, is invited to die by the arrogant and mischievous vampire Lestat, played by Tom Cruise; die, that is, and live forever. The story winds through Louis's life with Lestat and their vengeful vampire ""daughter"" Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst; a child who can never age, to his exploration to Europe and the Theatre of the Vampires, a coven led by the mysterious Armand, played by Antonio Banderas.

The screenplay is written by Anne Rice herself, and remains very true to the original novel, which will please fans of her writing. However, to those who have not read the book, many times the characters' motives will be hard to understand, as well as the particulars of vampire ""life"". The writing does an excellent job of bringing the undead characters to life, from the witty banter of Lestat to the lamentations of the lost soul Louis.

However, the acting does not manage to do justice to the wonderful writing in many instances. Though the movie featured many high-powered stars, few of them really seemed up to the challenge that the roles present. Brad Pitt, as Louis, pouts and groans his way through his role, making Louis seem less like a complex character than a brainless blubbering ninny. Likewise, the over-acting Antonio Banderas does little to develop the character of Armand, and his trademark Spanish accent is jarring at times and completely inappropriate for the character. Yet surprising was the performance of Tom Cruise, who really captures the essence of Lestat, and also of Kirsten Dunst, who played her role of a mature woman in a child's body to the point of being suitably unnerving.

Being a vampire movie, Interview features plenty of blood, gore, blood, and some more blood. However, it is by no means an 80's style slasher flick, and recalls the intelligent, mind bending horror movies of earlier times more than The Nightmare on Elm Street. The visual effects can be laughably cheesy at times, as vampires soar through the air as if on invisible fly wires, but the blood effects are chillingly good, and will repulse horror buffs until they find themselves moved to tears. The sets and costumes are equally beautiful and appropriate, and really add to the atmosphere of the film.

This movie is not for everyone. It has some very disturbing content, and does contain full frontal nudity, earning an R rating, but it is a must see for fans of the book, horror buffs, and people who enjoy a great action-packed and intelligent story, but don't mind one that's a bit unsettling. I personally enjoyed the movie on the whole, even with all its shortcomings, and would say it is best enjoyed when coupled with the original novel.",1144886400,6,3187,4.768115942028985

93417,2,0790729687,"On a whim, I recently picked up a bargain copy of ""Interview with the Vampire."" Familiar with the controversy surrounding the casting, I was perhaps most interested in judging that question for myself. To get that issue out of the way, while I do think that Cruise is miscast as Lestat, he does a creditable job and gives some of his more comical lines a nice turn. The real disgrace is Pitt, who is just awful as Louis, moping around in a constant funk, like a mobile grey cloud of angst and self-recrimination.

Having said that, however, dare I suggest he was only doing what the part demanded? And having made that suggestion, dare I go further and remark that maybe the big problem with this film is less one of casting than of whether or not the Vampire Chronicles make good material for movies? I like Rice's novels, but when I read them, I wondered how they could be filmed because they achieve their power through a combination of introspective characters and rich descriptions of sensual experience. The latter are certainly within the power of film to convey, and the handsome production design and cinematography demonstrate that the makers of ""Interview"" were attentive to the need. For the introspection to work, however, the scenarist and actors would have to find externalized equivalents to Rice's subjective passages that an audience can understand.

To put it mildly, they do not. Rice is a gifted novelist, but that's no guarantee she's a dramatist. The fact that she was employed to adapt the novel to the screen suggests a misplaced deference to the material that is testified to throughout by the lush, expensive over-production. ""Interview"" feels like nothing so much as one of those reverent bio-pics from the early sixties, about a Pope or a King at the very least, or an adaptation of something like ""War and Peace"" or ""Finnegan's Wake"" or the Bible. Which, when you think about it, is pretty silly when dealing with a popular novel about vampires. When the horror moments come, inevitably the filmmakers fall back on loud music, shock cuts, lots of gore, in short all the standard ingredients of cheap horror. Inevitably, the effects seem out of keeping with the pseudo-importance of the rest of the production.

A first rate director might be able to find a way to bring all these contradictions together, melding the ingredients into a vibrant totality akin to the novels' excitement. Neil Jordan's films tend to be one mark above ordinary. He seems to have a knack for recognizing interesting material, but not enough dramatic imagination to make it compelling. He's essentially a decorator, somebody splashing the occasional visual effect on the material with no real sense of how any of it-story, dialogue, camerawork, design, performance-should work. The results aren't disgraceful, just not very interesting for very long.

Which might be said for the whole film.",1139616000,5,2898,4.95679012345679

Maybe I'm not insightful to what Anne Rice wanted, but Cruise apparently saw Lestat as an emotional and dramatic soul who enjoyed being what he was, maybe even proud, and didn't appear to feel remorse for the hand nature dealt him. He always kept his sense of humor and energy throughout the movie. If that was his goal, then he accomplished it. I don't understand why some people didn't like it. I'm going to read the entire series soon, and maybe I'll have a different perspective, but as of right now, this is a very enjoyable movie, and Cruise did a great job in my opinion.

Still, I can understand why people felt the actors should have switched roles. I could see Pitt as the aggressive, seducing Lestat and Cruise as the ""tortured soul"". It really could have worked either way.",1138492800,4,1058,4.425641025641026
93419,3,0790729687,"The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film.

So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat-- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand.

I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in ""...Vampire"", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of ""La Jetee"" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones).

The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time.

A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...",1136678400,3,1089,4.746031746031746
93440,5,0790729687,"First off I just want to point out to the person who was freaking out in a review about the movie not being scary and it's ""pansy"" yadda yadda yadda.  This was NOT meant to be a horror film.  Anyone familiar with Anne's work would understand that she writes drama and the characters in her stories are indeed mythical: witches, vampires, ghosts etc.  If your goal is to watch a slasher movie go see The Mangler.

The truth is there ARE NO set rules as to wether or not vampires have a conscience.  Any outrage because of the portrayal of a vampire with one is well. . .odd.  Vampires don't exist.  So if you actually KNOW any vampires who are mindless cold-blooded killers and are bound to stand stubbornly by your plea at how OFF the mark this movie is, please introduce us!

I actually do know real life vampires who are nothing more than hardcore goth and blood drinking mortals.  Yet they too seem to have a conscience.  Sound the alarm! Vampires with a conscience! Haha!

There is no doubt this movie is intended to be full of romanticism just as are Anne's literary works.  It is unapologetically romantic and full of yes ""mush"" and emotion and *cough**cough* a battle with morality and conscience.  This is the REASON I enjoy her work.  If I wanted brain-dead horror I'd read something else, I'd watch something else-like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I was afraid to watch this movie when I first heard it was coming out because, like so many other fans, I had read Anne's work before she hit the mainstream and I had fallen in love with it and all it represented.  I wondered how Hollywood could bring her prose to life.  I was upset that Tom Cruise was Lestat yes, I was upset Brad Pitt was Louis yes, and I was even upset that Antonio Banderas was Armand (and I do LOVE Antonio!).

But after watching the movie the first time around I was overjoyed at how the characters were portrayed and I was totally blown away by Tom's attempts to capture the essence of Lestat.  More than that I was really impressed with Kristen Dunst as Claudia.  Even though I still had my power struggle with Antonio as Armand, if I forgot everything else about Armand-his history in the Chronicles-then indeed Antonio's portrayal captured Armand's persona of seduction and selfish destruction-and yes loneliness-the driving force of it all.

So, if you aren't afraid of romanticism and moral battles, of drama within an underworld of vampires, and you can allow yourself to get lost in the thoughts of starry nights, candle light, sexuality, and pain-then my friend this is the movie for you.  You can always watch horror slasher films another night, they come by the truckload.  Movies like this are few and far between.",1136332800,4,2705,4.63655462184874

93446,5,0790729687,"I have never watched a film so beautiful, so in- depth, and so mature on vampires. Anne Rice did a great job on picking the right people to make this film. And unlike the film version of Queen of the Damned, a very disgrace to the Chronicles it came from, Interview was very faithful to the story Anne wrote a long time ago. A thing or two was changed, but nothing that affected the movie from it's original storyline.

The actors were amazingly strong and believable and I don't care what anyone says Tom Cruise was the greatest as Lestat. That guy on Damned didn't even take the time to color his hair blonde, for he refused to even look the part of Lestat, while Tom Cruise did everything he could to act and look like him and Tom Cruise poured on Lestat's charm while the guy on Damned was dull and wooden. Tom Cruise did a great job on Lestat, Anne Rice even said so. Brad Pitt was fantastic as Louis and so miserable, exactly like Louis. Armand was played beautifully in Antonio Banderas and yes he was older than Armand actually is but everyone has to admit Antonio did a great job playing the seductive and manipulative Armand. Kirsten Dunst...wow was she a strong character for someone so young. I thought she would hardly be anything, yet as a child she was strong in this film surprisingly. She played Claudia flawlessly. Rea only had a short time in Interview but indeed he stood out as a great actor and of course Slater as the ever curious boy taping the entire story of Louis' held good ground.

Aside from the actors who all did a superb job there was the excellent job on scene and costume and music. All of this was done very well and made this one unforgettable film. The one thing I love about this film though is how it respected the work of Anne Rice's and obviously worked hard to put it in the right mood and put the right actors in to protray the certain personalities. I really respect everyone for doing that, for Interview is a great story that deserved a great film. Anne Rice said she wept when she saw the film, and I didn't weep but I certainly am moved by it. It's my favorite vampire film, and none other has matched up to it for me.

You want cheesy teen fluff you watch Queen of the Damned, but if you want a serious, moving and grown- up look at vampires this is your movie: Interview with the Vampire. It's about a vampire who tells a human a story, about his own life, right at the time when he was born into his life as a vampire. The rest of the film is a rollarcoaster of the vampire's ups and downs and the interesting people he meets along the way with his never ending question: What is the meaning of it all?

As much as I like Tom Cruise in everything I've seen him in, I can't help but wish someone more ""Lestat""-like had been cast as Lestat.  Especially after seeing Stuart Townsend in ""Queen of the Damned"".  Now THAT was spot on. Sexy like Lestat and no bad wig.

But.....LOVED Brad Pitt as Louis.  He was perfect in that role. All is forgiven because of Brad Pitt portraying Louis.

Nice casting of Antonio Bandaras as Armand, but after reading ""The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles, Book 6"", too bad the actor wasn't more Northern-European-like, or at least had the curly Botticelli-like hair was a big part of Armand's character and attractiveness.

The young Kirstin Dunst was a chilling Claudia.

All in all, a very well done adaptation of Anne Rice's novel but...oh! for a remake with a dangerously sexy Lestat-like Lestat as most of us imagine him...",1130371200,3,910,4.782051282051282
93448,4,0790729687,"There were a series of things around this movie that turned me off when it was first released.  Firstly, I can admit I was not framiliar with Anne Rice's work before she met mainstream success.  Couple that with the fact that they had chosen Tom Cruise to play Lestat and Anne Rice was vehemiently opposed to it made me question both this movie's integrity and quality.  I was pleasently surprised, however, that this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

Brad Pitt, in perhaps his best preformance (double for Tom Cruise), plays the broading, reflective Louis, a two hundred year old vampire who is telling his story to an interviewer, played by Christian Slater (in perhaps his last noteworthy role, ironically).  Louis is lonely, that's for sure, and hopes that by telling his tale that he will somehow atone for all the good and bad he's been through as well as caused during his two hundred year exile.

Louis takes us through a sweeping epic, crossing time and history.  Already depressed over the death of his wife and child, he is hoping for death when he meets Lestat and is given the gift/curse of eternal life.  Lestat, obviously lonely for a companion as well, makes Louis immortal yet keeps him at his side without being the best teacher because he wants Louis to stay dependent on him.  Later on, they create a sort of odd family when they bring an orphaned girl whose mother had died in some sort of epidemic, Claudia.  This family is dysfunctional, to say the least.  Eventually tired of Lestat's codependency and controlling nature, Claudia and Louis eliminate him and flee to France to start anew.  Here in France they meet another group of vampires in a macabre theater.  Claudia, as she did Lestat, grows weary of Louis and craves a new companion, but when the new companion is created the theater vampires take their revenge.  Claudia and her new companion are fried up in the sunlight, and Louis, deprived of his lady love, is left truly alone.

This is a tradgic tale as much as it is a fantasy.  Louis is an unusual vampire, as he seems to have more respect for human life than his counterparts.  He chooses to go through eternity alone, as it's best for him and the world around him.  I liked the aspect of being able to live forever, slogging through time and seeing the world as it changes.  But, Louis is still a monster, he's not the hero of the story even though he's the main character.  And the acting on all parties is a little on the hokey side, but then again the dialogue is preachy and a little silly too.  Kristen Dunst, although only a child when she made this movie, stood out as the femme fatale innocent child, an immortal Lolita if there ever was such a thing.  The sets, make up and wardrobe make for a lush atmosphere.

I've never been a goth girl, still am not, and have no desires to be, but this was right on in the most mainstream of horror / gothic movies as you can get.  Enjoy it for it's scenery and insights into the world of the undead.",1128988800,,2994,4.491682070240295
93449,5,0790729687,"Can't say enough about this film.
I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles from Interview up until Memnoch, and I was very excited when I first heard that this movie was being made.
The film mirrored the book perfectly with exception to the ending.  No spoilers here, but for those in the know, I felt they did the ending because there was never any hope for making the Vampire Lestat novel into a film.  If they did, it would have to be like three hours long, and they don't do that for horror/dramas.
The cast was amazing.  I remember at the time hating Brad Pitt for having to endure watching Legend of the Fall with the girlfriend.  I just didn't see him as a serious actor.  And then I saw his performance as Louis.
He was brilliant and I don't think that there is any other actor who could have captured the tortured soul of Louis better.
And Tom Cruise. . . .I never liked him before either.  What did a guy who did [...] like Cocktail and Days of Thunder have any right to be granted the role of Lestat?  But he was perfect.  He exactly matched Louis's description of his character and mannerisms.  Although as the readers of the series will know, Lestat is a much different character than in this movie as we later see in the Vampire Lestat.
When you saw this movie upon its release and were presented with Kirstin Dunst, you knew instantly that she was going to be a star for generations.  I have never seen, even to this day and even counting Haley Joel Osment's turn in the Sixth Sense and better acting performance in a young person.  Never.  And when you see this film, you have to be in agreement.  To go from playing the part of a nine year-old girl to playing an ageless vampire with the wisdom seen in her many years is a daunting task, and the way she handled it left you with the feeling that she will have much more to show us in her years to come.
The only disappointment I had was in Antonio Bandaras.  Armand is supposed to be a teen when he died, not a slightly overweight forty year old.  If I can only find a couple mistakes in an adaptation then I have to say I am pleased.
You have to see this movie if you are a Vampire fan.  And even if you are not, this is a great dramatic tale that tells of how precious life is.  A must see.

93481,5,0790729687,"There are three classes of vampire movie. First is the vampire as monster who subdues helpless victims and must eventually be destroyed before more victims become its prey.  From this ideas came the first vampire stories including ""Dracula"" and ""Nosferatu"".  Excellent stories.

Second, is the modern vampire as action figure.  Represented in the likes of movies such as ""Blade"" and ""Otherworld"" these vampires are nothing more than superhereoes and villians in vampire trappings going through all the comic book motions of fighting each other.  The first and more important law they must follow is to look and act COOL.  Shallow, silly, and only bearing a vague resemblance to the long and rich tradition of the vampire in literature, it perfectly fits into the modern cinema captivated by the wow-factor of special effects.

Third and last is the vampire as a fully-realized person and tragic figure. This form focuses on character, drama, and dialogue and was practically invented by Anne Rice.  It shines -- or rather radiates darkness -- in this film which sticks close to her original novel and gives the notion of extending the original stories of vampires as monsters but telling the story from the vampire's point of view.  I loved this film.  It isn't about fight sequences or bloody horror, but about creatures with human souls and how they deal with being something other than human. Some are up to the task of embracing their nature and others are not. The life they live and the choices they make are incredible and mundane, generous and selfish, attractive and vile at the same time.  It's not everyone's kind of movie but if you love character development and a touch of the fantastical mixed with a brooding and dark-tinged story, then see this movie.",1126396800,3,1768,4.959322033898305
93482,5,0790729687,"I am so proud. I saw this movie years ago, but recently watched it again and it took me back 13 years, to when I was 16 and madly infatuated with Lestat. A breeze would blow open my curtain at night and I would stiffen thinking it would reveal Lestat in my window, to which I would say, ""Please...go"" and he would respond, ""But you've been calling me for some time, my love."" Sounds irresponsible to me now that I'm 29 and haven't visted the Vampire Chronicles in a long time. Sounds young and childish to a flaw. However, when I first heard about this movie I was enraged that Tom Cruise and BRAD PITT were playing the leading roles! WHAT? I blanched. I mean, come on, aren't they just too pretty? However, when I began to see pictures of what they made Tom Cruise look like for the role, I was taken aback. ""That IS Lestat,"" I thought. And Pitt is not so pretty, but his frail figure was perfect for Louis. I had to admit I did the same thing when I found out Lucas had digitally altered the Star Wars Trilogy, but then again, who am I? He's the author. And so, when I read that Anne had overseen this and was pleased, I thought...well, who am I? If one the greatest and enthralling authors of all time says she likes what Hollywood has done to her book, then I must trust, right?

So, I loved it. I will always love it, I'm sure. Antonio was eloquent and just as hard and uncaring as the book portrayed his character, Santiago. Oh, and beautiful Claudia...could Kirsten Dunst been out performed by anyone? She really did a fantastic job.

First of all let me say that although Tom Cruise is indeed wonderful, most people have under praised the qualities of both Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderous. True the latter only has a short scene, but he puts on such a wonderful perfomance, we overlook that miscoming.

Brad Pitt, well is just awesome, as the vampire Louise who tries to redeem himself by at first drinking the blood of animals so that he will not have to kill. Kill he must, which one night in desperation he drinks the blood of a little girl, accidently keeping her alive,Consiquently Lestat finds her and gives the girl to Louise as a present. Hoping that the child will quell and banish Louise's troubles of killing, and stay with him.

Enter Kirsten Dunst as Claudia,who becomes Louse's daughter he never had, and the object of his outpouring of love and affection. Loved and Beloved, as the pair called each other, and so they where until the trouble started.....

They were able to create a world seperate from our own, yet incredibly believable. I love vampire folklore and i think this movie does it justice, the book is defintely incomparible to the movie, but the movie stands well on its own. I also agree it is not a horror, more a dark dramatic fantasy, but worth watching, the passion and emotion in the movie is very real.",1118102400,2,629,4.206611570247934
93486,5,0790729687,"First, let me say that I'm NOT a fan of Anne Rice's overly-romanticized, melancholy vampires.  However, I really enjoyed this movie!  Tom Cruise was very impressive as Lestat, along with Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst giving passionate performances.  For those who aren't familiar with the story, here's an extremely abridged version.

A landowner in the 1700's, (Pitt), wife dies.  He's understandably sad, even has a death wish.  A vampire, Lestat, (Cruise), takes him up on his wish and makes him immortal.  The story is what takes place over the next 200 years in their undead existence, uncluding a trip to Paris' underworld, the creation of a child-vampire, (Kirsten Dunst), and the never ending search for ""what's it all mean?""  As a wraparound piece, the vampire Louis, (Pitt), is being interviewed by a reporter in modern day San Fransisco, hence the title.

It's a very engaging story, told from the vampire's point of view, kind of an autobiography.

I remember when the movie was first released Oprah Winfrey did a studio audience screening, and her guest for the day was Tom Cruise.  I remember audience members asking Cruise questions like, ""How could you possibly play such an evil character?""

Tom kept replying, ""It's only a movie, and only a fictional character.""  I think it was a testament to his evolving talent and a great leap of faith on his part.  Kudos Mr. Cruise!

It's a great movie.  Great acting, great story, great camera work, scenery, costumes, everything!  Even if you don't like Anne Rice very much, if you like vampires, you'll like this film.",1115510400,2,1576,4.931558935361217

93488,5,0790729687,"This is the author talking. The film is shattering. For me, and of course I lack objectivity, it is The Red Shoes of Horror Films.  It got my book, it got my script, and the person responsible was the producer David Geffen. He is the one who drew together the finest talent in every field to do this film. He asked me to write the screen play. Was I part of ""the finest talent?"" I hope so.  He is the one who sent me a video of the film even though I objected to casting and might have screamed. I loved it. I called him to tell him. When he sent a print of the film to New Orleans for a private viewing for me and my family and friends, I was so overwhelmed by this picture that I came out of it crying helplessly in the arms of my editor Victoria Wilson. I stood there sobbing, holding onto Vicky, as the whole crowd of concerned people looked on. I couldn't snap out of it. I went out, got in the back of my car, and was driven home.  The film took me back to the night I finished the book -- 4 a.m. in the morning in the year 1973 -- in Berkeley, California, in a shabby ground floor apartment full of junk shop furniture, a beautiful place, where I sat on the couch utterly overwhelmed by the experience of ""the novel,"" a coherence that had come out of me -- vowing to myself that if no one published it, I'd sell it out of shopping bag to people on the street.  The film took me back even further, into the soul that had exposed itself in the writing. Darkness. No grace. No salvation.  The film got it. It got ""the glamor of evil"" and that darkness, that hopelessness, that despair.  It is -- and I say this now as a film buff -- a great film. Forget me. Forget the book. It's a piece of sublime work in which genius ""happened"" as it can in film when great directors like Neil Jordan, and great actors, and great professional on all levels are giving it everything that they can -- when  they have but one goal and that is to be true to something in which the author was true to himself or herself.  It worked. It's magic. And now ten years later people are discovering it. They are sharing that sublime vision. I'm thankful; I'm happy; I'm proud to have been part of it. I'm grateful.

Louis had an American accent (although it really should have been French Creole), Lestat had an English-sounding accent, with French inflection at certain points. Armand's accent, though it should have been Russian or Italian, was Spanish. Were we watching the same film?!

Not one of the characters in the film was German, nor did they have that accent. I suppose, as an Englishwoman, I should shout that Tom Cruise was being racist for sounding vaguely English!",1112659200,,608,5.141414141414141
93520,5,0790729687,"Interview with the Vampire is a fine work of cinematography.  The script is well-written to be in concise correspondence with the book, Tom Cruise illuminates the screen with his presence as the dark, gothic Lestat, and the scenery wonderfully reflects the passing of time through the eyes of a vampire.  Neil Jordan once again creates a masterpiece that will overall be remembered for its vivacious and emotional characters as well as its accuracy to the original story by Anne Rice.  In bringing the characters to life, it was easier and so much more convincing to believe that they were vampires.  Aside from the sterotypes  brought on by past films such as Nosferatu and Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview with the Vampire seems realistic and authentic.  The audience is immediately placed in the late 1700's listening to the tale of Louis, played wonderfully by Brad Pitt, who's will to die is so real.  He had lost his wife and child, and he's praying for death, a perfect time for Lestat to intervene.  Of course, in the book Louis mourns over the death of his brother, but still the message of his suffering is that he had lost a close loved one, and this sets the stage for his eternal nightmare: to become an instrument of death by becoming a vampire.  He wants death and death comes to him.  Perhaps it wasn't what he specifically wanted, but now he has an eternity to contemplate this decision he makes.

So, the movie continues to explore the subject of death, and this is due to Louis' respect for human life.  Lestat confronts Louis multiple times in an effort to make him realize that he must take human life in order to survive.  This haunting revelation takes an odd turn when Lestat creates the child vampire, Claudia, played by the youthful Kirsten Dunst.  She becomes a vital part of the story due to her attachment to Louis, and her sinister ability to kill, despite her innocent form of an eternal child.

As a final statement, it is overall a masterpiece of its time.  It has become an essential part to the horror movie genre, specifically vampire films.  So have an open mind, a good taste in high quality cinematography, and enjoy Interview with the Vampire.",1111708800,3,2183,4.717678100263853
93521,5,0790729687,"...REALLY surprised me. I didn't think they could pull it off...

But that aside, this was one awesome movie! It sheds a wonderfully unique light on vampires (there are no main mortal characters, btw), and the main characters struggle with the morality of killing and his ever fleeting humanity. Specifically on the movie, special effects, music, sets, costuming- all fine, and it wasn't a bad adaption of the book either.

This may seem annoying or trivial, but I feel I have to retribute to two flaming reviews this movie was given. 1)If you have any idea what a German accent sounds like, you'll realize that none of the characters speak like that, and 2)Interview with the Vampire isn't really a ""horror"" film or a normal vampire flick, it's about the vampires themselves, and how they live caught between humainty and blood lust. Okay, I had to get that out.",1111276800,3,863,4.785234899328859
93522,4,0790729687,"I was introduced to actor Tom Cruise when he costarred as David Shawn, a gung-ho red beret in the film TAPS. The film also featured up and coming actors Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn with film veteran George C. Scott as the Commandant of Bunker Hill Military Academy. I've been a huge fan of Cruise ever since I saw that 1981 film.

About a month or so prior to the release of Interview with a Vampire, a coworker told me the film was a best-selling Anne Rice Novel. After learning this, I borrowed the dramatized audio version from my local library to get the extra details I knew the film would leave out. If I could only use two words to describe my experience they would be BLOWN AWAY!

In fact, I was so taken in by the dramatized audio version of the book that I knew there was no way the Warner Brothers film could capture the essence of what I had already experienced. But, since I'm such a big fan of Cruise, I plunked down my hard earned greenbacks like everyone else, expecting a mediocre visual experience at best.

Could Cruise become the Vampire Lestat I had experienced? Could new comer Brad Pitt actually become Louis? And what of Claudia? How in the world could a young Kirsten Dunst ever hope to pull off such a well defined character?

Well, not only did Cruise bring to life the Vampire Lestat, but Pitt and Dunst were equally enthralling in their roles as well. The casting was flawless. This is one to see as director Neil Jordan did an excellent job of bringing the pages of the best-seller to the big screen.

The 1994 film was shot on location in New Orleans, San Francisco, England, Paris, and also offers excellent performances from Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, Christian Slater, and new comer, Thandie Newton, who later starred opposite cruise in Mission Impossible 2.

This film has everything: love, hate, life, death, ecstasy, terror, and murder. Check this one out, y'all! If you've already seen it, see again, or get the audio version and get a different experience. You won't be disappointed.",1108771200,6,2027,4.616666666666666

Although some of the cast members were not portrayed as explained in the book (Armand particularly), I felt that overall the acting was outstanding (Kirsten Dunst as Claudia was phenomenal, as was Tom Cruise as the enchanting Lestat) and the plot was as fast paced and as compelling as the book. I would have liked to see the complex relationship of Louis and Claudia displayed in more detail, but overall I have to say that I was extremely pleased with the way that this movie portrays this magnificent, seductive (and sometimes erotic) story of the genuine charatcter of Louis the vampire.

93525,5,0790729687,"This film is the best vampire movie EVER! It's beautifully acted, with a nothing short of brilliant performance from the young Kirsten Dunst and a surprisingly un-wooden Brad Pitt!

'Interview With The Vampire' is the story of a vampire called Louis (Brad Pitt) who is finding eternity somewhat wearing. He decides to tell his story to a young reporter (Christian Slater)-the whole story. Of how he came to be. He is visited by a charismatic vampire called Lestat De Lioncourt (a very handsome Tom Cruise), who gives him the gift, or bane, of immortality, but at a price - he must drink blood. Louis cannot stand killing innocents, and instead feeds off rats.. until he takes a young child called Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) in a moment of grief after watching Lestat torture a young woman. Lestat procedes to make a vampire out of her, and together they live as a happy family. Until the day that Claudia realizes she will never grow up and becomes extremely angry. Over the course of the story, they also encounter an actor vampire Santiago (Stephen Rea) and his 'leader' Armand (Antonio Banderas) and their legendary 'Theatre des Vampires'.

The story is flawless, as the screenplay is written by none other than Anne Rice herself, so it's very close to the book, unlike it's successor, 'Queen Of The Damned'. It is a brilliant film, and I urge you to watch it, even if you aren't into all things vampire.",1105747200,5,1404,4.75
93526,4,0790729687,"This would have to be one of the better vampire films.

Anne Rice authored the famous novel over a relatively short time after the tragic death of her daughter. In this case, the creative process aided the grieving process and turned her into one of the most read gothic novelists in twentieth century history.

Rice's screenplay is true to form, and the production value of the film is first rate. Before the film's release, there was a lot of noise regarding the casting. When Tom Cruise heard about the film, he lobbied hard, contacted his influential connections, and pulled a few strings, landing the coveted role of The Vampire Lestat. All the noise came from Anne Rice, because she didn't want Cruise to play the part. In so many words, Anne believed he was not capable of playing the charismatic vampire, as the character of Lestat is a complex one, requiring a certain cosmopolitan class and aplomb. Cruise won the role anyway as writers in Hollywood, as is well known, hold little power. In the end, however, surprisingly, Cruise managed to put in one of the best performances of his career. Lestat came to life and the film has slowly turned into a cult classic that can be viewed time and time again.

Rice's novel and the screenplay are exceedingly clever because the vampire is used as a metaphor for the human condition. The character of Louie is a representative of everyman - angry at the seeming absurdity of our existence. He loses his beloved wife and child and falls into a deep grief, hates the world and wishes only to die. The Vampire Lestat, in search of a companion out of his own loneliness, offers Louie a new lease on life...or death. Emotionally and physically at rock bottom, Louie accepts Lestat's offer of immortality and takes the plunge. Louie becomes a reluctant vampire because killing, he believes, is against his nature. This is the human condition: our moral inclinations and our basic instincts constantly at war. Louie rejects his new nature as a killer, however, he's no longer human - he now exists in no-mans land neither human or vampire, but as Lestat constantly reminds him, he must make a choice. This is existentialism in its purist representation, that there is no such thing as ""human nature"", and what we are, and what it means to be human, (or vampire) are always a matter of decision - there's no correct choice - only choices. In other words, man is nothing else but what he makes himself. Louie made a choice to join the dark side and then could not take responsibility for that choice, hence his angst about his true identity. Brad Pitt put in a believable performance as the reluctant vampire as we could feel his angst, his frustration concerning his new identity.

This is one of those films that can be pulled off the shelf occasionally and enjoyed, no matter how many times it's seen. This is an excellent story from an entertaining as well as philosophical point of view.",1103414400,14,2935,4.715399610136452
93527,5,0790729687,"Tom Cruise gives one of his better performances alongside the always good Brad Pitt and the extraordinary debut of Kirsten Dunst in this well made adaptation of Anne Rice's novel Interview with the Vampire. Though fans, and Ms. Rice, initially howled at the idea of pretty boy Cruise playing the lead role of ageless vampire Lestat he ends up doing a creditable job. My main concern at the time was not so much Cruise's selection but that of director Neil Jordan but here as well the producers made a fine choice - Jordon does a terrific job of creating a lush, decadent, decayed neo-gothic atmosphere. Antonio Banderas shows up for an effective turn as Lestat's rival Armand to round out a highly polished and effective cast.

93548,5,0790729687,"I saw it and loved it, later I read the book and totally loved it. At that point I stopped loving the movie, the book is great, the movie isn't. It's kind of making fun of the book. I read all the books Anne Rice wrote, not only the Vampire Chronicles. She is the greatest. The movie doesn't reflect that but Antonio Banderas as Armand is very, very sexy and it's exactly as I would see Armand. In the books Armand is a young boy but very sexy and full of charisma, I believe that Banders with that long dark hair is the best image of Armand. I love Armand, he's my perfect man, but as a boy, as an image it's not good. He's strong and mature, intelligent and sooooo sexy, he can't be viewed as a boy, he's a man trapped in a body of a teenager, now to put that on the screen would have been a complete turn-off. So I liked Banderas. Kirsten Dunst was great too.

About the subject, well it's a DRAMA, NOT HORROR, try to ignore the blood-sucking and you'll see it. But better yet, read the book. I'm sure that if you read one, you'll end up reading the chronicles. I like best ""The Vampire Lestat"", read after ""Interview with the vampire"" is best. You'll get a better idea of Armand.

93549,4,0790729687,"I love vampire mythology, especially Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. I have been a fan of Anne's anti-hero the vampire Lestat and his blood-drinking companions since high school. When ""Interview With the Vampire"" was going to be turned into a movie, I was a bit wary of the film as was Anne Rice, especially with Tom Cruise in the lead role. I can't blame Anne for being wary of Tom Cruise as Lestat. Much to my surprise, Tom Cruise put in a pretty decent performance as the devilish Lestat. Brad Pitt on the other hand wasn't nearly convincing as the tortured Louis. He wasn't bad but his performance didn't stand out with me. Kirsten Dunst was the perfect Claudia. She was perfect as the demonic child-vampire. Her debut performance was definitely an indication to what to come for this delightful actress. Antonio Banderas as Armand was so miscast. In the books, Armand was much younger when he became a vampire. That was the biggest miscast, not Tom Cruise as Lestat. Armand was only 17 when he became a vampire and Antonio Banderas doesn't exactly look anywhere near 17 years old. I also didn't think Christian Slater was right for the role of Daniel, the mortal that Louis encounters. The film itself was pretty much faithful to the book although the introduction of the film was not nor did the film ended like the novel did. The cinematography was gorgeous. Ten times better than what was in that crudfest called ""Queen of the Damned"" (which did not follow the books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" as it was supposed to be). The film was visual eye candy. It was what I imagined what New Orleans looked like in the early 19th century. I have to admit I have always thought that ""Interview With the Vampire"" was not nearly as good as ""Vampire Lestat"" or ""Queen of the Damned"" but nevertheless, it is still a good book and classic too. Overall I like the film adaptation. Too bad ""Queen of the Damned"" was a complete mess no thanks in part of the bad script, and awful directing.

As it goes on, it gets better. I know. I'd say it's like an ""immortality"" movie such as Tuck Everlasting. {Totally different plot, no vampires or gore}. {F.Y.I., this film even had some nudity in it, but it doesn't interfere with the rating because there's only 1 scene of it}.",1094601600,,598,4.4363636363636365

This film shows that Vampires aren't blood sucking animals,they have emotions and a soul. Ann Rice puts you in this world and makes you think, what if you could get a Vampire to sit and tell you the story of his life. Neil Jordan's directing was hypnotic and so was the acting. Brad and Tom should have been nominated for an Oscar and I'm glad this film got the Oscar for best original score.

93554,4,0790729687,"It was in development hell for over a decade and then there was the whole debacle over Cruise as Lestat and River Phoenix popping his clogs and Brad Pitt stating the filming as the worst experience of his life.  Then there was Cruise shrieking about the homo-eroticism being too much (from the man who made locker room love Top Gun this is bizarre!) and so on.

By all accounts, it should have been a disaster, but thanks to a great director, cinematography to die for (scuse the pun), staggering sets and an extraordinary cast, IWTV stands up as one of the best vamp films ever.

Yup, the book is better, but as far as translating to screen goes, a lot of the narrative tries to be faithful.  Let's face it, if it followed the book, we'd have been sitting through a lot longer film!

Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are two of my most disliked actors.  Yet Cruise's smarmy grin is perfect for narcissistic Lestat, all the pomp and splendor and ego of the character isn't much of a stretch for Tom... And Pitt's pretty boy looks and peculiar way of talking strangely ends up exactly as I had always pictured Louis.  He may have had a rotten time filming, but as it seems to have given him the chops to turn Louis into the tortured anti-hero, I'm very glad it wasn't all chocolate boxes and roses for the fellow.

The muted colours of New Orleans and Paris are stunning and quite decadent, with tinges and splashes of red throughout reminding us what flows throughout the film.  Apart from a couple of dodgy looking backdrops, the sets are fairly staggering scale wise and lend brilliantly to the telling.  The effects, the teeth, the veins and the iridescent eyes, are wonderful (making the Buffy cast look like they've been mucking about with modelling clay) and give the vampires a natural (rather than full out preternatural)look to remind us that the Dark Gift really isn't about turning into bats and wolves, but being anchored to the earth by the cruellest means possible.

The falldown is Armand who, with Antonio Banderas looking rather embarrassed to be sloping about candlelit dungeons, is not at all the angel-faced, auburn haired charmer I'd hoped for.  But the relationship between Dunst (Claudia) and Pitt more than makes up for this little disappointment - the full thrust of the grown woman in a child's body and the horror of it is excellently portrayed.  The hair chopping scene is quite, quite jarring and Louis's discovery of her body sums it all up.

IWTV has a rubbishy end for the book lover, but ties in neatly if you think about it.  All in all, this is a wonderful telling of a very difficult novel and if you can look past the missed bits, this is rewarding viewing.",1092096000,4,2686,4.60167714884696

93596,5,0790729687,"I have watched so many movies that consisted of vampires and most of them have been so lousy that a few times I've felt tears line my eyes. But this film has to be the most beautiful, most truthful, and most amazing vampire movie ever created, and I can't thank Geffen and Warner enough for it. Even now, when I watch all these horrid vampire films that are continually made, I always know there was at least one vampire film that took my heart as well as my breath. The movie is darkly and seductively lit, just like the mood always is, and the actors fit the setting perfectly. No obnoxious, idiotic vamps here, but actually serious, compassionate and real characters. If you are a lover of vampires, and even more, a lover of the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice who wrote the novel to this movie, you will absolutely love both the actors and the way the movie is shown. Unlike other vamp movies, the vampires act their age- you know, mature- and the actors are supremely gorgeous. Even Tom Cruise with all that makeup on and blonde locks still appears just as sexy as ever- and do I even have to mention Antonio Banderas with that long hair? Well despite my drooling, there are many great actors playing in this movie. There's Tom Cruise as I've said, but at first glance you'll probably not even know because he has molded himself almost to the perfection of the character Lestat the way Anne made him appear in the novel, and has the exact personality of the vain and careless Lestat. And then there's the everlasting Brad Pitt who plays the sad, mournful Louis, and honestly, when you see this film, you'll see Brad Pitt is the best man to play this role. Antonio Banderas is spectacular as Armand- honestly, despite his age, Antonio is the splitting image of the ancient regretless vampire, and there's Christian Slater who is Malloy, the boy who interviews Louis as he pours out his whole story on tape. Then who can forget the cynical yet witty Stephen Rea who plays a head vampire actor in Armand's Parisian theater,and little Kirsten Dunst, who played the tormented child? All perfect actors who made the movie a gorgeous gem. You will not be disappointed with them I assure you.
This film is a lovely and yet exhilerating piece of work that speaks of the vampire Louis who has lived many decades and wishes just out of sheer want to tell his story. So he picks an interviewer who is nameless in this movie but if you read the Chronicles will know as Malloy. Up in an apartment in San Francisco these two sit in the room, Malloy taping Louis as he tells his long and sordid tale. He goes right to the punch and tells you how he was 'born to darkness'. It appears that for time sake they change the story around a bit at the beginning and instead of telling you his brother died and he blamed himself for it as Anne wrote in the novel, they tell you he lost his wife in childbirth, and it deeply upsets him and places him in a deep state of depression that is just teetering on he being suicidal.
Then Tom Cruise comes in as the striking character he is and instantly you are watching Lestat convert Louis to what he is, a vampire. Then the movie goes deep as the duo fight constantly and then convert a daughter, Claudia, that Louis loved ultimately, possibly an outlet for the pain he felt by losing his real child years back. Then as he travels the world, seeking for vampires, Armand comes to his life and tells him the facts of life from a vampire's angle, entrancing Louis ever more deeply and yet also leaving him more bitter than before, but always still feeling.
This movie tells a story not just of vampires, but also of humans as well. It tells the truth of human life and how sensitive it truly is, and that some people see life much more differently than others. It also teaches you though about vampires and how if they exist this is how they would be. There are a few that are rude and vain like Lestat, and then there are some that are compassionate and loving like Louis, and then there are some that are just tormented and lost like Armand.
The makeup and costume affects were excellent, the settings were lovely, and the story is perfect for just a relaxing night alone on the couch. And although I did hear some rumors that there were a few disputes between the actors on set, especially between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, they sure hid it well and made this a movie to be proud of.
I recommend this movie to all viewers alike, for it's a movie meant for everyone to see, not just supernatural lovers. I guarantee you, you'll be laughing, gasping, and crying throughout the entire movie. It's just that good.",1081382400,5,4637,4.456470588235294

This movie demonstrates the truth of the vampire, that like all creatures, including humans, they are emotional, thinkers, intellects, compassionate, lovers, and some even befriend mortals.  The vampire Louis, brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt, is the central character whose very actions depict a sudden transformation from human to immortal.  He must re-evaluate what he deems ""evil"" and ""good"" to put into perspective his new found life or death depending upon how you see vampire existence and is remarkably emotional as Rice describes Louis in her novel.  Kirsten Dunst is a extraordinary Claudia, a child vampire, who must also come to grips with her immortality as child having been made a vampire as a child, never to mature physically.  Tom Cruise, was a brilliant blond, blue-eyed, Lestat, he is the true spoiled brat prince, arrogant vampire as Rice intended him to be.  Louis (Pitt), reeks hatred against Lestat (Cruise) for not being able to explain the meaning of their existence as creatures of Dark.  This movie is brilliant, complex, intelligent, and destroys the vampire stereotypes.  The vampire, having once been mortal, is more human than us all, having lost the luxuries of walking the daylight.  A spell-binding journey for the mind.

93609,4,0790729687,"I'm not at Anne Rice fan and I've never read any of her books. I am however of fan of this movie and enjoyed it a lot.
Interview with the Vampire is not a horror movie. It is anything but it. The movie tells us the story of Louis.(Brad Pitt) He's over 200 years old and he's telling his life story to a reporter played by Christian Slater. He's tells us how he became a Vampire from the bite of Lestat(Cruise) and how he hates being what he is. You see the child they have played by Kirsten Dunst. He tells about his good times and his low times. It's a tragic story.
Brad Pitt is great as Louis. You can argue this as the best performance that he as ever made. He holds his own with Tom Cruise. It's a believable performance. You actually think he is the Vampire and he plays the emotions well.
Tom Cruise is simply fantastic. Lestat is a very arrogant character and Tom plays it to perfection. He shows lots of energy and the role is very well acted. Like Pitt he becomes the character and he's no longer Tom Cruise. It's a shame to see ""Queen of the Damned"" and watch Stuart Townsend play a horrible Lestat.
Kirsten Dunst is great. She's so creepy and scary in the movie. I heard an interview with her a couple of months ago, in which she was mad that she hated the scene in the movie where she gets to kiss Pitt. It's a memorable performance and it's her humble beginning.
I liked Interview with the Vampire. It and ""Bram Stokers"" are in my opinion the two best vampire movies ever made.",1079049600,,1491,4.216783216783217
93610,3,0790729687,"This movie was initially a disappointment as it deviated quite a bit from the book by Rice. It totally skipped Lestat's tortured, painful childhood, and missed out on much of the other subtleties that Rice created in the character, turning a three-dimensional, very realistic (given that it's a fantasy creature) character into a stereotype vampire. Frankly, Tom Cruise was totally uninspiring in his role as Lestat such that until the closing scene of the movie I didn't even realise that the part had such 'stellar' casting.
Given the nature of the book and plot, with its chronological timeframe spanning hundreds of years, it's impossible for the movie to be fast-paced as an action flick, as criticized by some reviewers, but I think that in its slower pace it has remained true to the book's Gothic, brooding atmosphere.
Although Brad Pitt does /not/ look the part of Louis (at all!), he has managed to do a wonderful job portraying the adolescent, conflicted vampire and Kirsten Dunst shows her talent in her portrayal of a woman trapped in a child's body, two major redeeming points for the movie.
But perhaps the best touch to the movie, IMO, is the last scene where Lestat regains life. It was this scene which totally revised my opinion of the movie, though it was not in the book. Perhaps because it was so symbolic of the undead's clasping greed for life that is the core of Anne Rice's vampire, the vitality, exuberance and speed as evinced by Lestat and showed such promise for a movie of the next book.",1077580800,,1518,4.775665399239544

The only actors that get a B or higher are the Interviewer and Antonio Banderas who's already Spanish accent is fitting.
It does look real and it that case I never got the feeling of watching a horrible slasher movie, the story is the highlight of the movie and therefore still worth watching. Somehow I still feel it could have been done better than this.",1076198400,4,577,4.351851851851852

93614,3,0790729687,"I'm not going to bother telling you about the storyline. You've probably heard it already...
Overall, I thought that this was a nice take on Anne Rice's novel itself. Like most fans, I was a bit wary of the cast, especially when I heard that Antonio Bandaras was cast as Armand. Not that I don't like him, but doesn't the vampire have auburn hair with cherub-like features? Sorry, but Antonio just didn't cut it for me. He was better in Zorro.
As for the other actors, I thought they played their parts quite respectively. Tom Cruise was indeed bratty as Lestat, and I was quite surprised to see Brad Pitt play such a whiny and sympathetic Louis. Ah, don't get me wrong. I loved Louis in the book. Claudia? For a child actress (during the time it was filmed) I thought Kristin Dunst did pretty well for herself. What I wished to see though was the side of Claudia that was truly evil. Oh yes, the movie-goers understand her plight and all, but what they didn't see was how EVIL that little vixen could be, and how she brought on the destruction of Lestat (and Louis in a manner of speaking). Such an endearing child, isn't she?
This vampire flick shouldn't exactly be called horror, though. Fans of Anne Rice should understand that Hollywood WILL change certain passages to satisfy the theatre audiences. (Yes, I'm referring to the ending sequence of the movie, the one where Lestat is in the car.) I was quite upset with that part as well.
My personal opinion? I liked both the book and the movie. Both are quite excellent in their own manner. But first, read the book then watch the movie. Then enjoy yourself as you sit back, relax, and watch Claudia pull out her hair again.",1073433600,,1678,4.5230263157894735
93615,4,0790729687,"After watching this movie I read some of the reviews that said this movie was boring or simply bad - just out of curiosity. And all of them had one thing in common. They said that it wasn't a good horror movie.
Indeed, this is not much of a horror movie.
It was never intended to be.
Making it into a horror movie would be an insult to the book, which was sensual, intensive and (a bit sloppily, I must admit) philosophical. That is much more than can be said for horror movies. The movies that manage to be this just don't fit the box anymore. And it is ridiculous to call them bad just because they do not fit certain standards or expectations.
The actors were great, although the full potential of Banderas was not taken advantage of. Kirsten Dunst astonished me - a child with the ability to play such a complicated role seemed impossible to be, yet here she was, as good as her co-stars Pitt and Cruise, who were simply stunning. What was missing in the movie was the chilling cruelty of the child, Claudia, which was certainly the most frightening aspect of the book - in the movie she just seems a lost little girl, growing into a teenage girl, not a woman, really - but this is not the fault of the actress, certainly.
If I could change a few things in the movie, these would be: 1) making Claudia seem more like the cold-blooded doll she was in the book, 2) using the charisma and mysterious nature of Banderas to its full potential, and 3) changing the scenes that take place in the modern times - these, I feel, lack the style and taste of the rest of the movie, especially the end, which was so typically Holywood I positively hated it.
This movie, however, was a fine one. It was desperate, sensual, erotic and very aesthetically pleasing - more than I expected.
The beauty of the human body. Incomparable, indeed.",1073088000,3,1827,4.408284023668639
93616,2,0790729687,"I very much looked forward to this movies release. Having read the famous book upon its publication, I, like many, had my own vision about who should play whom, and how it should unfold. Such obsession can only bring disappointment, and this movie certainly did that, for me. Though the production values are lavish, I found it was totally mis-cast. Tom Cruise is, I'm sure, a nice person, as his constant gleeful grimace would suggest. But, in my opinion, he is just not that good of an  actor. He has done some decent roles, and says all of his lines with all the conviction he can muster. But his casting as ""Lestat"" totally ruined this movie for me. You are never not aware that this is Tom Cruise you are watching. I also found Brad Pitt awful as ""Louis"". He says his lines as if he's very uncomfortable with the words coming from his mouth, as if he's reading them from a monitor. I really don't blame these stud-muffins for being cast, as this is what sells movies to the general public. But I would much rather have seen two excellent unknowns, of which there are many, play these roles. Antonio Banderas is laughable as ""Armand"", not only mis-cast, but he says his lines as if his mouth is full of marbles. Stephen Rey, cast hot off the heels of his role in ""The Crying Game"", acts insane. There are also several roles, such as one of the female vampires in ""The Theatre de Vampires"", which could have been beautifully developed into a brief but memorable, sensual, horrifying role. Instead, we get some blousy redhead who cavorts like Joan Rivers. This movie needed to be crafted with skill and depth, and it just wasn't. It has all the mystique of almost any rock video, glossy, glamorous, and disposable. It should have had the atmosphere of a film such as, say,  the original ""Cat People"", a film made with a small budget, before special effects, but which still weaves such dark suspense and horror with its skill and subtlety. Again, when a movie is made from a hugely popular book such as this one, it's almost always bound to be a disappointment, and, for me, this movie is no exception. I really wanted to like it, and went into its viewing with the upmost of anticipation and optimism, despite the casting. But, as it progressed I slowly had to concede that this film had no ""soul"", it was made to please the masses, most of whom  have no taste. A lousy movie, made to be cast into video oblivion, where it now lies.",1071100800,8,2435,4.504524886877828

I don't know why I ever thought Tom Cruise as a pompous, nihilistic vampire was worth watching, because he's not.  He's just TOO Tom Cruise to stand, and all the makeup and poncy clothing in the world can't change his mannerisms and facial expressions.
This movie takes itself much too seriously, and all the manufactured angst and darkness reminds one of the public access Floridian goths on SNL.
Honestly, Brad Pitt's acting was pretty okay, but any redemption to be found in his performance (as far as the film goes, overall) is eclipsed by the wretchedness of the rest of the production.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, save teenagers who perhaps are still impressed by this kind of thing.",1070236800,7,825,4.802816901408451

Armand, the 15 year old auburn/red haired vampire?  Granted, Antonio played the role VERY well.  However, were the casting crew members on drugs when they decided how to cast this?  Bradd Pitt and Kirsten Dunst were both really good.  On the whole, just about everyone was (except for Tom Cruise).  Still - really slap-shod job on the whole.  The book is far, FAR better than the film.  Sadly, ""Queen of the Damned"" which is basically ""Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" all jam packed into one film (with creative liberties GALORE) was STILL better than this one, imo.",1067731200,3,865,4.588235294117647
93639,3,0790729687,"Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are sensual and voluptuous books, full of heavy gothic prose and powerful images. The movie of her first novel, 'Interview With The Vampire' is none of the above, but still manages to be a decent enough film, although it lacks any resemblance to the mood of Rice's original writing.
The plot follows the adventures of fledgeling Vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), as told to a reporter (Christian Slater), one night in New Orleans. He starts from the beginning of his undead life and brings us right up to the present day, and introduces us to a host of grim characters along the way, the most prolific of which is Lestat, played with horrible boyishness by the hopelessly miscast Tom Cruise.
The movie has many good points. Neil Jordan's style of direction suits the mood of the film very well, and in some places, excels (the Theatre Des Vampires sequence is particularly memorable). Also excellent is Pitt, in his role as Louis. He remains as faithful as he can to Rice's pedantic, melancholic Vampire as the oddly lacklustre script allows. The soundtrack is also deserving of a mention, as its lavishness complements the gothic mood of the film beautifully.
The majority of glowing reviews for 'Interview', however, don't take into account the original novel, and it's here that the film fails. The character of Lestat DeLioncourt is that of a tortured and malevolent boy-monster, and yet Tom Cruise plays it with such high-camp gusto that we wonder if Warner Bros. gave Anne Rice money to retract her Tom Sawyer comments when she saw the initial screen tests. In Cruise's hands, Lestat becomes something like a Leslie-Nielsen style vampire, all fangs and drama and no substance. Similarly, Kirsten Dunst, who has now matured into a good actress, gives an overstated and hammy performance as Claudia, who, in the novel, is wise beyond her years, an unnatural and immortal monstrosity who eventually brings about the destruction of both Lestat and herself. And Antonio Banderas should never have been given the role of the Ayrean 16-year old Armand. He still speaks with a heavy Latino accent and is clearly a hispanic man in whiteface. He's nothing to do with the character of Armand.
That said, 'Interview' is still a very good movie, though it fails to deliver the same punch and atmosphere as the original novel. It's a solid story, with many good points, but for anyone who's read the book, it's a shame that so much potential was cast aside in favour of Hollywood-style Overstatement.",1067644800,10,2533,4.906759906759906

No, no, this movie offers so much more, just like the books. It's a peek at the vampires living their lives, without pesky human interference, and if a human dared, these vampires are unlike many of the modern created vampires, they would destroy any human and his clan.

He is then tormented in his immortal life because his mortal soul never really leaves him.

I didn't like it that much, but decided to give the book a try because I love horror, and heard that Anne Rice was a fantastic writer. I heard right, and after I was done reading it, I knew that I must see the movie again.
With an amazing cast, this movie holds a place as one of my favorites. Quickly I would like to talk about what it is about. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is an older vampire who finds Louis (Brad Pitt), a sad, lonley man who recently lost his wife and child at childbirth. Lestat changes Louis into a vampire. Louis is still suffering. Lestat decides to give Louis a ""child"", Claudia (Kristen Dunst). They travel together, but begin to fall apart, and I will tell you no more.
Tom Cruise didn't deliver as well as I had hoped he would, but there is no doubt he gave a good performance. I always like the book better than the movie that follows, so this may add to my disappointment. But don't get me wrong, like I said, in the end, Tom delivers.
Brad Pitt absolutely amazed me. I never began to like his work until recently, after seeing Fight Club. I can say nothing more except that Brad's work in this movie is absolutely amazing, and to my point of view, captured Louis perfectly.
Kristen Dunst was amazing as well. She was pretty young when she acted in this movie, and as she said in a behind the scenes interview, she could never have truly understood the character and her feelings. Yet she manages to give a performance that could ask nothing more of her. A mature adult trapped in a young child's body- this is what Kirsten's character was, and she was amazing.
Antonio Banderas gave a good performance as well, although I don't think that the movie showed the real Armand. I pictured Armand differently, thought of his actions, feelings differently. I was a bit disappointed with this.
But overall, this movie really was fantastic. I would recommend reading the book by Anne Rice first however, or like me, you may find it a bit... blah =P",1058918400,2,2062,4.428947368421053

And the #1 thing about that scene is, am I the only one who noticed/realized that she has bangs!? Hello, can someone explain to me why all her hair grows back so fast and long but her bangs stay short!? I was also shocked at the casting for the charector Armand.

93680,4,0790729687,"This movie is a favorite of mine, though I do not give it the five star rating, because it is not perfect by any means.  I read this book and the books that followed because of this movie.  While it does not follow the book exactly (the whole thing with Louis's brother, Lestat's father, Lestat in Paris) it does an excellent job.  There are lots of little things that make me truly love this movie that Queen of the Damned forgot about.  There is the part where Louis is sitting staring into the candle while Lestat throws grapes at him, out of the entire movie this scene is probably the best when it comes to showing the relationship between these characters.  There is also the part where Louis is burning down the house and Lestat breaks through the window and they fight to which Lestat responds ""Shut up, Louis!""
Claudia is amazing.  While in the books she is younger than six, here she is about 12, but the fact is you could never find a six year old child with that type of range.  Her performance is amazing and truly portrays Claudia as the amazing and disturbing character she is.
Armand is the most disappointing, while Antonio takes a noble stab, his appearances is almost the total opposite of Armand.  Armand is short, has auburn hair, and is very young being about 16 or 17.
Christian Slater does an excellent job as Daniel Molloy (the reporter).  The end, however, is a tad bit aggravating to those fans of the book. Needless to say, there is no part in the car with Lestat. (I will admit, this is a part I enjoy, but far from the book.)
Many of the women I know who enjoy this movie are in it mainly for the top stars and any excuse to watch them.  If you are watching it for this reason you may be disappointed as both are in quite a good deal of make-up, which may or may not add to your appreciation of their looks.  If you are coming in strictly with a huge love for the books you might also be disappointed.  Things as I have mentioned have been changed or cut entirely.  However, if you come into this movie strictly because you want to watch a good vampire movie than this is a good one for you.  While not the typical vampire action movie (if you are looking for that, watch Blade) it is more thinking and gives a better idea of what it might actually be like to live as a vampire.  If you are looking for more fun, less thought, and wild music watch Queen of the Damned.  What you think of this movie is all a matter of what you are looking for.
This movie is unashamedly dark.  If you are not a fan of dark and depressing movies do NOT see this because you will not enjoy it.  However, if you have an appreciation for the dark things of life and story lines this is probably the movie for you.

Interview With The Vampire is a different story, though. As most of you know, Interview With The Vampire is based on the book by Anne Rice. The book is better, but the movie is great in itself.
The movie's beginning takes place in the present. Louis, played by Pitt, tell his life story to an interviewer, Slater, who's name we never find out. Although, in later books by Rice you find out it's Daniel. Most of the movie, I'd say about an hour and a half, is a flash back. You learn about Louis' compainion and maker Lestat, played by Cruise. Lestat is so evil and charming most can't decide whether to love him or hate him. Tom Cruise does a wonderful job as Lestat. Lestat and Louis make a vampire child, Claudia who is played by Dunst. Dunst is fabolous as Claudia. It's a shame that's the best acting she's ever done in her whole career to date.
This story is a sad and beautiful one. Although there is some nudity, voilence, gore, and death this movie is not trash at all. It has all the elements of a good movie. It makes you laugh, cry, and think. Most movies today can't make you think. The only problem is you become very wrapped up in this movie.

Perhaps the most charismatic and best portrayed character, was Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She was ""born into darkness"" at eight years of age, fed on by Louis and turned to darkness by Lestat. Beautiful, dark, intelligent, and sophisticated, Claudia feels none of the regret that Louis does. Indeed, her blood lust is equal to or greater than Lestat's. The lives led by vampires are highly romanticized in ""Interview..."" They are enticing, their world unbelievably intriguing, yet they are children of darkness, knowing no light, no release from their eternal lonliness, except when they kill.

93685,4,0790729687,"I've never been obsessed, or even mildly fascinated, by the concept of vampires. While I'm still not, the film adaptation of Anne Rice's novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE does provide an evening's worth of above average entertainment.
It's a tough job being a vampire, but in Rice's lurid world somebody has to do it. The film opens in modern day San Francisco where bloodsucker Louis (Brad Pitt) gives an interview to a journalist (Christian Slater). For the record (and for the audience in an extended flashback), Louis begins his story in 1790s New Orleans where he was a plantation owner, who crosses paths with the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Lestat is looking for a bud to hang out with, and seduces Louis with immortality's allure. Louis has nothing better to do with his idle life, and so allows himself to be transformed into one of the Undead. After a period of knocking around together, the boys decide that their N'Awlins flat needs, I guess, the feminine touch. So, Louis stumbles upon (and bites the neck of) a 12 year-old plague-orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). The girl is so fetching that our heroes decide to keep her around, and Lestat subsequently transforms her into an addition to their mini-coven. The trio are thick as thieves for years until bad things start to happen.
I can't really award more than 4 stars because, for me, other vampire films have been more impressive. SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE (2001) was more cleverly done by far. And DRACULA (1979), starring Frank Langella, while not considered a great film, had scenes of cinematic artistry not matched here. Indeed, much of the power of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE comes from visuals perhaps composed for their shock value.
The plot of this film is largely the commendable revelation that vampires' lives are lonely, wretched affairs. An eternity of sleeping in coffins, avoiding sunlight without some serious sunblock, and biting the jugulars of nubile, scantily-clad maidens isn't really a glamorous lifestyle. However, it's great fun watching one of this era's greatest Silver Screen hunks, Tom Cruise, be so amorally menacing in a charming sort of way. Dunst is captivating as the willful Claudia, who never physically matures beyond her young age, but whose inner self hardens as we watch. Squinting at Claudia's curls through half-closed eyes, I could almost see Shirley Temple. But America's Princess never wielded a knife like this! Pitt's Louis is so burdened with guilt over his misguided career move that he's a constant wet blanket. By the film's final scene, which is the essence of Lestat, it's apparent he too wishes Louis would just get over it.",1047772800,2,2641,4.99092970521542

Cruise is simply magnificent as Lestat, the vampire who bites the grieving Louis (Pitt), and thus begins Lestat's formation of an immortal family.  Cruise shines like no one (not even Rice herself) could have imagined as Lestat.  Stuart Townshend has nothing on Cruise as Lestat as he carries the dark and seductive vampire trademark of the vampire, and this remains one of the best performances of his career.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis conveys all the remorse and melancholy that goes along with anyone stricken with immortal bloodlust.  The rest of the cast includes a young Kirstin Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, and Christian Slater (in a role originally planned for River Phoenix, Slater replaced him after his untimely death), all of whom give great performances.  All in all, Interview With the Vampire is one of the finest horror films of the 90's, and the final shot of the film leading into Guns 'N Roses covering the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy For the Devil"" while the credits are rolling is reason enough to give this a look.",1046563200,2,1298,4.931192660550459

Ms. Rice adds a lot more to vampire legendry than do many of the gothic novels of contemporary times. We are taken back in time with a mind that seems to have actually been there. All the characters are given such life & personality, that the story gives the impression that it could actually be feasble. There is a mysticism here, a deep fascination for the fantasy, that gives it a life all its own.
The brilliance of a truly vampiric talent, resurrects the folklore into a way of existance. Many of they who feel they are born too late in this dull age of mass-consumerism. Finally, we elect are experiencing a menagerie of gothic masterpieces remade to please, & inspire one to dig up the original classics from their cobwebbed & dusty shelves of libraries & parlours.
The movie is very accurate to the book, the characters dramatically animate on screen, more than enough to delight audiences, impress the fantoms, & even sufficiently please the authoress, & it is quite rare to please an author, unless the production is pretty much identical to the original. The movie was not terribly ""hollywood-ized"" as some other vamp films were. The book & the genre's integrity is kept intact. The world portrayed therin seems to come alive from within, a part of one's soul projected onto the screen.
Tom Cruise makes for an excellent Lestat {who would have known?}, & the others do not dissapoint either. Sure, there really is no substitute for curling up on a dark & stormy night, with candlelight illuminating a good horror novel, but I think it is finally time to intigrate such marvellous movies by the darkness of a black candle's flicker. For many of us, it has already been long as such.
Interview With The Vampire is top quality entertainment for vapire lovers. It contains much emotional/situational relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic & enthralling. We, as Gods, will be able to relate a lot of the philosophical aspects spoken in moments of vampiric revelation.

93711,5,0790729687,"INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES

(USA - 1994)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / SDDS

INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES is that rarity in modern Hollywood terms: A star-driven blockbuster which uses the theme of eternal life to explore the meaning of existence and the nature of death and grieving. Based on Anne Rice's bestselling 1976 novel (itself written as a response to the death of a beloved child), the movie features two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars - Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt (both astonishingly beautiful here) - as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world changes around them. Cruise plays a seasoned bloodsucker who revels in his own outrageous decadence, and his wilful excesses are roughly contrasted with Pitt's horror at the necessity of consuming human blood, until Cruise is forced to create another 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Kirsten Dunst) who subsequently refuses to grow old gracefully, leading to betrayal and tragedy.

Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal (TITUS, FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN), and beautifully designed (by Dante Ferretti, GANGS OF NEW YORK) and photographed (Philippe Rousselot, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT), the film's epic sweep carries its central characters through the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore.

But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Anne Rice herself - allows the story to unfold at a leisurely pace, providing us with a deliberate insight into the monsters at the heart of the story and the catastrophic events which shape their destinies. The film concludes ironically, with a 20th century invention (motion pictures) which allows Pitt to see his 'beloved sunrise' once more (illustrated with clips from the likes of SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS, GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and there's an incredibly moving sequence involving a once-proud vampire laid low by his own vanity.

The mood is somewhat spoiled, however, by a silly trick ending which upsets the delicate balance established during the first half of the film. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of the late and much-lamented River Phoenix who died during pre-production, and his role (as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title) was taken by Christian Slater.

I didn't think I would like Tom Cruise as Lestat but he did a wonderful job and everytime I reread one of the vampire books from Anne Rice I always think of Tom Cruise as Lestat.

93714,4,0790729687,"Few films could match the pre-release hoopla of the 1994 vampire epic ""Interview With the Vampire."" Based on the now-classic Anne Rice novel and starring Hollywood big guns Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, this goth horror fantasy lived up to expectations in amazing fashion due to terrific period detail, superb performances and the always-interesting direction of the talented Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game"").
Granted, much of the fascinating Rice Novel (the first of her Vampire Chronicles) was forsaken, but so much is followed verbatim that even the most dedicated devotee was - for the most part - pleased. Pitt makes a perfect Louis and, surprisingly, Cruise is terrific as Lestat. Their verbal and eventually physical warfare makes for great fireworks along the recreated riverfront of 18th and 19th century New Orleans French Quarter.
This is arguably the greatest vampire film ever made, though fans of Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Hammer's ""Horror of Dracula"" may disagree. But the look, the emotion and the angst of these stylish and oh-so-beautiful vampires (Antonio Banderas' Armand is also a memorable character) should capture the imagination of just about any moviegoer with a taste for the unusual.
After viewing ""Queen of the Damned,"" a sad and utterly moronic version of the third Anne Rice novel from her Vampire Chronicles, one can't help but appreciate this thoughful celluloid portrayal. Rarely hitting a bad note - with the exception of a tacked on Hollywood-Guns-and-Roses ending which nearly capsizes the entire film, ""Interview With the Vampire"" is a great example of what big money moviemakers and producers can create when they take supernatural material seriously.

93716,5,0790729687,"The vampire movie has a long history in films whose focus ranges from the sardonic to the comic to the thriller.  But it took INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE to show the undead as having day to day problems not unlike those of their mortal victims.  Director Neil Jordan has taken Anne Rice's novel and glitzed it up with a kaleidoscope of color to present a three century leisurely flashback related by a vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) to a reporter Daniel (Christian Slater), who becomes more involved in the tale than at first he thought.  Though Louis does the telling, he shares center stage with his mentor vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise), who gives him the gift of eternal life.  During the long years of a life that stretches from the French Revolution to modern day America, Louis never loses sight of what it meant to be human, even with all its failings. Louis kills and kills again, but he hates who he is and shares a strange hate-love relationship with Lestat, who keeps trying to remind Louis that he is what he is and ought to take joy in that.  Much of the film revolves around a home-erotic relation between Lestat and Louis, and later between Louis and another French vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas).  There is a further subtext of incest between Louis and a very young girl Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Louis turns into a fellow vampire.

  As in many vampire movies, the dramatic thrust is often equally divided between the frequent scenes of neck biting and the equally obvious eroticism enacted between vampire and victim.  In INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, both Louis and Lestat combine the historical bloodiness of earlier vampire movies with the pulsing sexuality that was raging in all concerned.  And while all of Louis' story is being recounted to David, the focus begins to shift ever so slightly from the one being interviewed to the one doing the interviewing.  During the course of the tale, David learns that human beings often present themselves to known vampires in the hope of joining the ranks of the undead, thus assuming their mantle of power.  David learns that it is not enough to wish to become a vampire.  One must be deemed worthy to become one.  This wish to stalk the living during the night is a potent one, yet the frequent films like this one portray the vampire as weaker than his victim.  In the world of the vampire, might does not make right, and INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE emphasizes this painful lesson only too well.",1037404800,,2459,4.710280373831775

93739,1,0790729687,"""Interview with a Vampire"" commits two fundamental errors, irredeemable in the horror genre:
1) It demystifies vampires. Vampires are scary because they are enigmatic. They have proved such an enduring icon of horror movies because their lifestyle appears glamorous. They lurk around the fringes of the frame, never wholly revealed, because revelation is inherently anticlimatic.
2) It domesticates vampires. The first offence might have been forgiven, had the scriptwriter granted vampires an exciting, erotic existence. Instead, he humanizes vampires by placing them in a domestic context. This, he seems to believe, will elucide the moral dilemma of vampirism. On the contrary, it renders the whole subject so mundane as to be boring.
Oh yer, this review would not be complete without noting that this film is ridiculously verbose and pretentious. Not only are we subjected to boring, domesticated, demystified vampires, but we have to endure their irritating existence for over two whole hours - inexcusable, to say the least. And the whole costume drama side is just so incongruous, it's farcical. And why did we ever need to go to Paris - isn't New Orleans atmospheric enough!!! Cheap directorial stunts like this attempt to cover up serious gaps in plot. And what is the plot of this ridiculous enterprise, anyway - there is no message, other than vampirism is morally bankrupt, yet inexorably attractive! I could get that from Blade, which was a far more entertaining film!
Sorry to subject you to this rant, but just writing this i am continually reminded about how much i objected to this film. Unless your tastes are more towards homoeroticism - which is replete is this movie - stay away from this poor excuse for horror/drama!",1035676800,8,1739,5.148409893992933

Casting was good with the exception of a slight age problem having Antonio Banderas play the eternal 17-year old, Armand. Tom Cruise did a decent job of bringing Lestat ""to life"". Overall I think most Rice fans will be pretty satisfied with this movie.",1033344000,,539,5.0
93742,5,0790729687,"Of all movies, novels, and lore surrounding Vampires, Anne Rice explores sides of culture that one would think unimaginable in early times. Her unrestricted work examines homosexuality, the pain of immortality, and the elegance of vampires in a way that breaks any traditional boundaries a vampire story ever had.
Interview with a Vampire is a clever, elegant, and deeply engaging story of myth versus realism (though, it has not been proven that vampires exist, however if they did, Anne Rice portrays them on the human scale.) The movie wavers from the book, that is to be expected, but not in the ways that doomed ""Queen of the Damned."" I believe there was one review I read where the person was disappointed that there weren't stakes, garlic, and all the other things that associate us with Vampyric Legend. Well, for that, those came out of Dracula and if that's what your seeking, that is the movie you need to buy.
This movie is more of an erotic tale set in the most beautiful of areas with, of course, some of the vampire lore. It centers on Louis (Brad Pitt), a wealthy man who having lost his wife and child seeks death as an answer. Hence, he becomes the victim and love of the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the choice between death and eternal life. Louis rejects his fate afterward and doesn't share the passion of Lestat, the homosexual passion which is never really brought forward in the movie. Louis' love is Claudia, a young girl prey that he thought he killed, but Lestat turned to a vampire. The movie follows Louis over a few centuries and culminates in a spellbinding ending with the Vampire Armand (Antonio Banderos) and the return of a vampire that was thought to have been dead.
The interview is Louis' recollection of events to a reporter (Christian Slater,) which in turn creates the entire story. There is more involved in this movie than ever could be written in a review, but it is one of those movies that keeps you locked in and headed to the bookstore. Sadly, the movie wasn't followed by ""The Vampire Lestat,"" instead the powers that be opted for ""Queen of the Damned."" Cruise, Pitt, Banderas, and Slater are nowhere to be seen in the newest movie. Perhaps that's why there are masterpieces and then there are capitalists on that masterpiece without a shred of literary decency beyond the profit game.

While not knowing if the second film is any good or not, it would have to do a fantastic job to keep pace with the original.  I honestly can't think of a way they could have made ""Interview With the Vampire"" better.  I have read most of ""The Vampire Chronicles"", and this movie captures the essence of this world to a ""T"".
The biggest coup was probably getting Tom Cruise to play Lestat, and he delivers.  Ann Rice had her initial objections to him, but they were later recanted.  What Cruise does best is to play the arrogance of Lestat, while still making him somehow likeable.
And the supporting cast makes me think that ""Queen..."" is going to be a real stinker, as none of the originals appear in the next film.  Brad Pitt doesn't shake up the screen, but his job is to be narrator, and in this he performs well.  Kirsten Dunst shows how she was going to be a star in the future with remarkable poise.  Stephen Rea plays the vampire you just want to strangle, and Antonio Bandaras shows enough Charisma as Armand that it could have spun off into it's own movie.
But alas, it doesn't look like any of these are going to be in any future Rice movies, and I get the feeling that the whole franchise may have been stopped in it's tracks.

 Tom Cruise steals the show. He made a perfect Lestat. Brad Pitt also pulls off the ""whiny"" Louis brilliantly, and Kirsten Dunst shows her great talent in such an early stage of her acting career as Claudia, the child vampire who longs to grow up.

93779,5,0790729687,"""Interview With the Vampire"" is a grand, spectacular, over the top movie, based on the first book in Anne Rice's seemingly endless ""Vampire Chronicles"". When it was released in 1994, it was reviled by some critics and audiences members. But I suggest that Ms. Rice's books are the types that do not lend themselves easily to being translated to the screen. Consider, for example, the feeble, atrocious movie made from Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" in 2002. I think the producers of ""Interview"" took the right approach by using the old-fashioned, overblown approach. In this sense, it reminds me of older `classics' like ""The Ten Commandments"" [1956], ""Ben-Hur"" [1959] and ""Dr. Zhivago"" [1965] - movies so sumptuous that any attempt to debate their `literary' merits is virtually pointless. Such epics are designed to amaze and to entertain. That is exactly what ""Interview"" does.
To me, it's main fault is its casting of Tom Cruise as Lestat, a move the author public decried, although she later retracted her criticism. But she was heavily invested in the project, both as its script writer and as a profit participant. I, of course, am not, being just a simple moviegoer. I really like Mr. Cruise in certain roles, but, in my mind's eye, Lestat he is not. Though he wasn't quite old enough or famous enough at the time, I can picture Jude Law as Lestat. Or Ethan Hawke, perhaps. Maybe even Nicholas Cage. This casting error is partially offset by Brad Pitt's Louis. He is absolutely the right actor. In fact, he, too, would have been a decent Lestat. Nearly stealing the movie from the two megastars is Kirsten Dunst. About twelve years old at the time, she is unbelievable good as Claudia, the child vampire. Time has proven that Ms. Dunst's performance was no fluke. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea are fun as Santiago and Armand.
I think director Neil Jordan had a rough time on the set of this movie. While he did an admirable job, I think his forte is rightly smaller, character driven pictures such as ""Mona Lisa"", ""The Crying Game"" and ""The End of the Affair"". Composer Elliot Goldenthal contributed a powerful music score. Much of the dazzling look of the film is the work of cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot, whose other work includes ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""The Emerald Forest"" and ""La Reine Margot"". Production designer Dante Ferretti also worked on ""Titus"", ""The Age of Innocence"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"".
I think that the people who conceived ""Interview"" as a movie were determined to give it a both an expensive look and a timeless quality. If so, they succeeded. This helps enormously to overcome something that is inherent to all ""The Vampire Chronicles"": The characters and their tales are both hauntingly beautiful and decidedly repulsive. It is this contradiction in both the books and this movie that makes one either an ardent fan or a detractor.",1026345600,,2887,4.918032786885246
93780,4,0790729687,"I haven't seen a vampire film as good as this one since ""Nosferatu"".  All the actors did an excellent job portraying vampires, especially Kirsten Dunst.  This was not an easy role for a child actor in their first film.  It was about a man named Louis(Brad Pitt), who was bit and turned into a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Louis is having a hard time coping with drinking blood and murdering people.  However, he can't fight his urges any longer and he bites a little girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), which turns her into a vampire as well.  Soon, Lestat, Louis and Claudia become a little family and shares a house.
  After a considerable amount of time, Louis and Claudia can no long bear to live with Lestat any longer.  So, Claudia tricks Lestat into drinking blood from a corpse, which causes him to rot and sort of go into a coma.  At that, Louis and Claudia run away together and live a pretty happy life for a while.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I am going to stop talking.  You should see this if you like vamp movies.",1026345600,,1035,4.389473684210526
93781,3,0790729687,"I never thought Tom Cruise would undertake the Impossible Mission (no pun intended) of being cast as a vampire.  The storyline, script, editing and special effects are all superb in this blood-sucking classic, but what made me give it a ""3"" rating on a scale of ""5"" was Tom Cruise.  I spent the entire time trying to make Cruise ""fit"" into a vampire film.  Though he is convincing, I couldn't help but picture him in ""Top Gun"", ""Rain Man"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Cocktail"" while I was viewing this flick.  When the dust settled...and the last ""stake"" had been planted, I came to the realization that if a horror fan watched this film with no past knowledge of Cruise, it would be a classic.  For example, Jack Nicholson was cast in the horror flick ""Wolf"" with Michelle Pfeiffer.  He was the most horrific werewolf I had ever seen on the big screen.  Trying to adapt the ""cool"" Cruise...the macho womanizer...to a vampire role, was not quite as easy a task.  It works, but true Cruise fans will look beyond his evil spirit and never truly believe that this guy could be a relative of Dracula.  Don't get me wrong, this is one of the best vampire flicks I have ever seen.  However, I would have cast someone like Willem Dafoe (of ""Spider-man fame) or Matt Dillon (aka his role in ""Wild Things"") for a more believable film.  If you are a true vampire flick fan...add this to your library.  If you want to see the best vampire flick of all time, invest in ""Fright Night"" (starring Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowell, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse).  You won't be disappointed.  It will scare the ... you.",1026000000,,1606,4.609154929577465
93782,5,0790729687,"I was a little wary about watching this movie. The book had been amazing, and I didn't want it ruined by a horrible movie. But this movie was perfect; it stayed true to the book, but not so much that it was boring to someone who had read the book. Tom Cruise did an excellent job of playing Lestat. He brought the character to life, from Lestat's mysterious anger at the world right down to his hysterical laughing fits. Brad Pitt also did a great job of portraying the sad and hopeless Louis. The best actor, I think, was the young Kirsten Dunst, who played the child vampire Claudia, a grown woman trapped in the body of a child.
 A basic summary of the movie for those of you who haven't read the book:
 The movie begins when Louis, a 200 year old vampire, is egged into telling the story before Louis was made a vampire. He recently lost his wife in childbirth, and has no hope left in life. He longs for death, and his wish is granted in a almost sadistically twisted way when a mysterious vampire, Lestat, gives him death by making him one of the undead. The rest of the movie tells Louis's story; the making of the child vampire Claudia, and their quest to Paris to find another of their kind.
 A warning: This movie is very graphic, and contains an explicit nudity scene. If you don't like blood, I wouldn't reccomend watching this!",1021852800,5,1340,4.373493975903615

Overall, it is an interesting, mesmerizing tale that mostly stays true to the book. Cruise, Pitt, Dunst, and Banderas did a great job playing their characters, it was just the way i imagined them when i was reading the book! They also looked very realistic as vampires. The best done scene(in my opinion) was young Claudia's transformation into a vampire.

Anyway back to this movie, It was wonderful. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I laughed, I screamed, and I cried. Claudia made me angry, Louis pissed me off and Lestat almost made me weep. The end hurt me though because Lestat took off with Danial. Why do they always have to have Lestat run away with somebody that he is not supposed to? why?

The whole of the story, however, is a recollection of the vampire played by Brad Pitt, which takes place about two or three hundred years ago.

Secondly, the special feautres. The list looks quite impressive, and was another reason I bought this version having already bought the first DVD release. The sound is the only decent thing about this disk. The Interview Gallery, the Documentary, and the Introduction (listed as 'A Special Introduction' on the sleeve!) are all culled from the SAME interview clips. I mean, what the hell?! What a complete waste of money, and what a huge disappointment for a fan. The Introduction was just laughable. I expected to see Ann Rice and Neil Jordan sitting together saying Hi, Enjoy the movie. But no. It's just three of the interview clips (they include one of Antonio Banderas too) that are used in the Documentary. Please! It was laughable - ... Now that's funny.

93812,5,0790729687,"Visually and atmospherically, ""Interview With The Vampire"" is a beautiful film and it is great to see that this DVD from Warner Home Video is bringing the film to life like never before. In a direct comparison to the 1997 DVD release of the film - it was one of the first DVDs in the market, actually - it becomes obvious that technology has made big strides. While the image quality of the original release was outstanding at the time, the new transfer exhibits a notably higher definition. Although the master from which this DVD has been created appears to be the same that was used for the DVD release three years ago, the film looks remarkably better on this DVD. The movie is presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen presentation in a 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.

The color reproduction is more faithful to the film's original presentation without any signs of discoloration. The level of detail is incredible and edges are sharply defined without the signs of edge-enhancement that were evident in the earlier release. Blacks are deep and always maintain enough detail without breaking up. The highlights are beautifully rendered while contrasts are perfectly balanced, restoring all of Jordan's ominously dark and atmospheric imagery. Color reproduction is very faithful with strong hues and tones, never bleeding, and free of noise. The compression of the movie is virtually flawless without any signs of compression artifacts in the presentation, leaving all the details, and colors fully intact. Interestingly however, the menus found on this disc, are riddled with compression artifacts like pixelation and banding, which is quite surprising given the overall stellar presentation of the movie itself.

The disc contains 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio tracks in English and French as well as an English DTS audio track. Just as in the video department, Warner Home Video brings out some spectacular quality in the movie's audio presentation. The Dolby Digital track is beautifully an engaging without the slightest signs of noise or distortion. With its good use of the surrounds, the track exhibits a beautiful spatial integration and flawless imaging. Even the subtlest ambient effects are evident in the presentation, adding to the haunting beauty of the film. A good bass extension adds to the movie's visceral punch, which helps giving some of the more dramatic action scenes the necessary impact.
The DTS track that can be found on the disc is equally impressive and actually manages to outperform the Dolby Digital mix on a number of occasions. The dynamics of the track, the clarity and natural reproduction of the score is simply breathtaking. The spatial integration creates a sound image that is extremely lively and boasts of the most subtle sonic nuances and timbres. Dialogues are well integrated in all versions and always understandable.

Director Neil Jordan has also contributed a commentary track to this release, which is very engaging and full of valuable information. Jordan covers a plethora of aspects surrounding the production of the movie. Without notable pauses, Jordan easily coves the entire 2 hours of the movie's running length and manages to remain interesting, entertaining and informative over the entire course. You will walk away from this commentary with a new-found appreciation for the movie and the people involved. The faithfulness and efforts that went into making this the atmospheric film it ultimately is, is impressive and full of exciting tidbits.

When starting up ""Interview With The Vampire"" a 1-minute introduction will greet you, which helps to set the right mood and expectations for the film. The introduction can also be found in the disc's ""Special Features"" section where you will also find ""In The Shadow Of The Vampire,"" a new 30-minute documentary featuring interesting interviews with Anne rice, director Neil Jordan, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stan Winston and many others. Not only does it cover different aspects of the movie and the novels themselves, but also the peripheral area of vampirism in general. It is a great piece that you shouldn't miss to watch. The disc also contains the movie's theatrical trailer and a link to a special feature on Warner's website, called ""History Of The Vampire.""
Warner Home Video has prepared a spectacular package for ""Interview With The Vampire"" with this DVD. Given the quality of all the content it is surprising Warner managed to squeeze four audio tracks in top notch quality on the disc, together with a beautiful anamorphic transfer and even supplements like the documentary. All in all, this DVD turns out to be an incarnation of the movie like you have never experienced it, so don't miss out on this one.",1009324800,4,4764,5.143225806451613

93845,5,0790729687,"Interview with the Vampire: The saddest vampires you will ever see.
 In a massive crane shot of the San Francisco bay, our journey starts.  Moving through the streets of the Town, the angle settles in on a large window, encasing a single man, timelessly dressed and displaying a somber look.  He begins.
It is 1791, and the setting is New Orleans.  Brad Pitt is miserable, alone, and drunk.  In a montage of glimpses into the pathetic, tiresome life of a Louisiana plantation master we see how dull and lifeless Pitt's Louis really is.  Once he is bitten by a vampire, however, that all changes.  Left for dead, he is visited by this phantom of the night who offers him a new life, ""One [he] could never imagine.""
 Director Neil Jordan's Vampires are unlike any ever glimpsed before on the screen.  They are not mindless bloodhounds, scavenging for any piece of flesh they can get their undead hands on.  What these creatures of the night are, to put it simply, is decadent.  Beautifully dressed with silky smooth, albeit unnaturally pale skin, they live lavish lifestyles, surrounded by servants and valets.  Theirs is a sad eternity, living cursed lives in which they become martyrs out of their own accord.
 Tom Cruise brings unexpected fresh blood into the old legends of the undead with his character, the Vampire Lestat.  It seems that, long ago, Lestat realized that without living well and enjoying his nights, he would wind up miserable.  He therefore chooses Louis, perhaps the worst candidate for immorality, to accompany him through the years, disregarding the fact that Louis looks for death around every street corner.
Using Louis' plantation as a home, he lives his nights gaily, feasting on aristocrats, fresh young girls, and gilded youths.  He has no regard for human life, as well he shouldn't, according to him.  Either it is the supernatural aspect of the character or Lestat's innate talent for wooing women, but the viewer finds it strangely appealing to watch him seduce women and men alike into his grasp, only to drain the life out of them like so many cattle.
The real stars of this movie, however, are Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst.  Louis and Claudia are bonded by an unshakeable love for each other that spans centuries, and it shines through in every shouting match, gesture, silence, and embrace these two engage in throughout our brief glimpse into their worlds.  As a nine year old Vampire, Claudia is faced with a most difficult life:  Live forever, but live it as a child.  She spends the first 30 years in simple tutorage, but then moves on to become the angst ridden, anger filled woman-child that brings her milky white, smooth as death skin to life.
The burden of all this falls on Louis however, who feels the pain of her loss of innocence more than she ever could.  With the years to look upon her, he observes as only an eternal father could, with sadness.  During a poignant sequence which serves to tear out the souls from the viewing audience, Lestat's first and only tears fall from his face.  It is in this moment that we see the undying love he feels for Claudia, and how mortal these creatures really are.
 Even a movie as well directed as this one, however, is nothing without an incredible score to accompany it, and Interview With The Vampire is no exception.  Elliott Goldenthal scores this film with a deft hand, capturing the most intense moments with stunning violin solos, swooping cello and bass parts, and tops it all off with a cover of the classic `Sympathy for the Devil,' by The Rolling Stones.  It is accomplished by none other than latter-day greats Guns N' Roses, and ends the film in a staggeringly twisted climax that will leave you begging Ann Rice for more.  In short, Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is a demonic treat, a sinful feast for the eyes, and will sate your lust for cinematic blood for centuries to come.",1002585600,,3904,4.743703703703703

93849,5,0790729687,"Let me begin by saying that I have not read the book and am judging the movie solely on its own merits. ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a luscious, guilty pleasure of modern filmmaking, visually resplendent and with wonderful performances by all (including Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea). It follows the adventures of Louis de Pont du Lac (Brad Pitt), a 200-year-old vampire hailing from Louisiana, as he recounts the story of his life (and unlife) to interviewer Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater). Along the way we meet his maker Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise), his ""daughter"" Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), and Armand (Antonio Banderas), leader of the Parisian vampires.
Tom Cruise, in my mind, perfectly portrays the elder vampire Lestat...beautiful, cunning, selfish, a seducer, many of the same qualities present in Armand, and possesses an excess of dark humour. Brad Pitt's Louis still clings to the last shreds of his humanity...his sense of right and wrong, the value of life, the horror of killing in order to survive (angstmaster Nick Knight from ""Forever Knight"" springs to mind). There is a lack of onscreen romantic tension between Cruise and Pitt...something that makes their relationship seem less immediate and binding. However, there is definitely a spark between Louis and Armand (Antonio Banderas), and it was easy to believe that Louis was tempted to stay as a companion to such an intelligent, beautiful vampire who could teach him the answers to his questions. Kirsten Dunst is phenomenal as Claudia, the vampire with the mind and desires of a woman eternally trapped in the body of a doll-child.
The visuals are lavish, moody, stunningly brilliant, especially the world of 1800's New Orleans with its brocades, silks, and elaborate dresses. The atmosphere is appropriately dark, with plenty of fog and menacing nighttime damp. Elliot Goldenthal's score is string-driven, pulsing, tense, and underscores the action perfectly, the crowning piece being ""Libera Me"".
Yes, this film is graphic at times, including two very graphic scenes involving mutilation, numerous ""feedings,"" homoeroticism, and brief nudity, but ""Interview with the Vampire"" is an unconventional drama that probes the meaning of life, death, love, seduction, and regret. More than anything Anne Rice's vampires make us realize the conventions and trappings of humanity.",998179200,99,2376,5.389784946236559
93850,5,0790729687,"Interview with the Vampire is a pure example of what good horror should be. Actually, I would classify it as a Dramatic Horror because that's simply what it is. Interview tells the story of a 200 year old vampire (Brad Pitt) who isn't happy with being what he is. A vampire. In the present day, we see him telling his life story to a man (Christian Slater). As he tells it, we see the story play out. How he, Louie, became the vampire he is, and how it almost destroyed him. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is the vampire who made Louie. Their relationship is shown as a love / hate type thing where it seems as if Lestat only puts up with Louie because he has too. Not being a respectable vampire, Louie only wants to drink the blood of animals and not harm a human being, but the first person he does harm, puts a burden on not only him but Lestat also. It was a little girl (Kirsten Dunst), and Lestat decides to change her into one of them, and make her their ""daughter."" That, and what occurs after that, is a very interesting and never dulls. It keeps your attention, and the characters take your emotions.
  The actors who portrayed the characters in the film were astounding. I believe this is Tom Cruise's best part to date. He brought life to an undead character, and a character who would not die. Brad Pitt's eyes brought soul to the character of Louie, there was real depth there. But the most superb is the acting of Kirsten Dunst. Only at the tender age of 11, her acting spoke volumes as the role of Claudia. In the movie, her soul aged but her faced never changed, and Kirsten worked very well with that.
  The mood is set just right in every scene. The tone of the movie is dark, and mostly all of the colors are dark. Sometimes a dull bright green will contrast with the colors, but it only makes the tone better.

93851,5,0790729687,"As a fan of author Anne Rice, I was anxious to see ""Interview"" when it made its cinematic debut, but I was very skeptical that the movie would be able to live up to the novel.  Since Anne Rice herself adapted the screenplay, it was very true to the original spirit of the story, and the ensemble cast is outstanding.  The only cast member that didn't suit the character in the book (although he gave a commanding performance; had you not read the book, you wouldn't have any problem with this casting) was Antonio Banderas as Armand (Armand was supposed to be very young, cherubic and Auburn-haired).  In addition to the engrossing plot line and the top-notch performances by all of the actors, the visually stunning use of light, color and fabulous period costuming as well as the understated special effects (edited so well, the effects are not easily noticeable as such) make this truly entertaining.  The DVD picture is very clear and sharp (I did not find the Chpt. 15 glitch distracting), and the DTS sound (especially in surround) is phenomenal.  The DVD also contains great extras - especially rewarding are the interviews with all of the principal cast members, with the director and with Anne Rice, and the complete Director Commentary.  If you liked the movie, you MUST see the DVD.  Learning how attention was paid to every production detail by every one involved in the movie (for instance; Stephen Rea (my hero!)spending a great deal of personal time studying how French Theatre of the Macabre performances were actually delivered in order to accurately portray the vampire, Santiago) makes watching this movie even more enjoyable.

93877,5,0790729687,"This movie was everything I had hoped it would be. It was true to the novel, and it caught all the details that most movies would have missed. Louis is timid, Lestat is rebellious, and New Orleans is just how I imagined it. The cast was excellent: Kirsten Dunst was the perfect sweet/cunning/evil Claudia, and Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise pulled off roles I never imagined they could play. (Thandie Newton has a cameo as a slave -- she was later in M:I2 with Tom Cruise.) Only one thing rang false for me, and that was the casting of Antonio Banderas as Armand.
Anyone who has read the novel knows that Armand  a) is seventeen, b) has auburn hair, and c) is Italian. Mr. Banderas is none of these, and his casting was the only detraction from this gloriously evil movie. If you plan to watch *Queen of the Damned* when it comes to theaters, I strongly suggest you watch this one first, and then compare.

93879,3,0790729687,"OK, so it's tired and repetitive to critisize a film for not being as good as the novel. We've all heard that complaint more times than any of us can remember.
I so wanted to love Interview With The Vampire, but unfortunatly my knowledge and love for the novel it is based on came between us. It's difficult to judge a film on it's own merits when you are able to point out the changes made from the book and how they were detrimental to the film's lasting success. Interview with the vampire will never be regarded as a classic film, and there are many reasons why.
Firstly, the Character of Lestat is a vivacious, charismatic and incredibly attractive ""man"". When reading the description of Lestat in Anne Rice's own words one actor immeaditaly springs to mind... Brad Pitt. Interesting then when it was announced that Tom Cruise was taking the role.... which in itself is ironic since Tom Cruise actually fits the description of Louis and has the abilty to convey the same personality traits as Louis. So this is the first big mistake. Had Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise reversed roles I am convinced both of them would have garnered Oscar Nominations. An interesting side note to this casting error is the decision to cast Antonio Banderas as Armand in a role designed to be played by an actor that can look like a cherubic 17 year old boy. Does that sound like Antonio Banderas? This second casting error completely throws off the dynamic between the characters.
Another big mistake was to sell the movie as a horror, then go on to remove the one portion of the story that best fits the genre. Before Louis and Claudia arrive in Paris, they first went to Eastern Europe in search of their vampiric origin. What they find is perhaps the only genuinely frightening part of the tale. They stumble across another vampire. At this point the only other vampire they have encountered since Lestat. This new vampire is the stuff of nightmares; a lumbering, blood crazed monster that is quick to attack Louis and Claudia and soon has them convinced that they will never find another of their own kind. These few scenes in eastern Europe would have been scary and also serve to give more emphasis on the slow collapse of Louis and Claudia's relationship.
Even a fan of the film, who hasn't read the book, can surely see how these casting changes and additional scenes would have made such an amazing diference to the movie. Remember when Anne Rice published that letter decrying the film... well her instincts were right. This is a classic example of a movie that failed to live up to it's own potential.",983318400,2,2593,4.639130434782609
93880,3,0790729687,"Everyone knows that no one wanted Tom Cruise to play the lead of the vampire Lestat in this film. Everyone just knew he was too much of a lightweight pretty boy to pull it off. Writer Anne Rice was livid with this casting choice. However, Cruise surprised everyone when he pulled off a stunning and sexy performance. Anne Rice herself was said to be surprised and even more than that, delighted. Cruise's outstanding performance coupled with the performances of Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst, then just a child, precocious as she was, made this film good. And on top of this the scenery was lavish and moody just as you would expect. I am not a fan of vampire stories nor of Anne Rice, nor particularly of Tom Cruise of Brad Pitt, but I will say that this film was surprising in every way.",982800000,,823,4.5675675675675675
93881,5,0790729687,"When this movie opened on the big screen, I did not go to see it because I thought it was going to be a ""spoof"" about vampires.  However, when I saw the video, my assumption couldn't have been further from the truth.  I found myself enthralled with the tormented Louis (Brad Pitt), the flamboyant Lestat (Tom Cruise), and the exquisite child Claudia (Kirsten Dunst).  This is a very passionate, expressive, and vivid adaptation of Anne Rice's novel.  Tom Cruise brings the character Lestat to life with all the bells and whistles (he went for it) and is one of his finest hours on the sliver screen.  It seems the vampire Louis was written for Brad Pitt - need I say more.  The child vampire, Claudia, was played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst, and she looked the role all too perfectly.  I found myself caught up in the macabre atmosphere and genre of New Orleans and the 18th Century.  This movie takes the classic vampire as we know him, and shows a different side where human emotions, vulnerability and the need for companionship meet.  Underlying it all is the ""thirst"" (no pun intended) for knowledge about the origins of the ""dark gift"", the fear of abandonment, and future survival.  It takes the fears that we go through as humans and fuses them with these vampires.  For those of you who like the mysterious and eerie, this is a must to see.  I fell in love with it and have watched it many times over.  I love Anne Rice's book, but adore the movie.",982713600,13,1458,4.540229885057471
93882,5,0790729687,"""Interview With The Vampire"" is an intriguing movie that looks deeper into the vampire than any other film involving these mysterious creatures.  Instead of being portrayed as heartless killers as in most other vampire films, ""Interview"" shows a new side, a compassionate side capable of feelings, including love.
As the plot progresses, the audience becomes connected with the characters it reveals.  Louis, the main character, becomes especially easy to connect with because the audience can easily find parts of themselves within him.  Louis is a very troubled vampire, continually struggling with himself.  On one side, his instincts guide him to survive, but, on the other side, his gentle heart forbids him to partake in the evil deeds necessary to do so.  This internal conflict that Louis eternally faces symbolizes the choices and judgments each human must deal with everyday.
Louis, along with vampires Lestat, Claudia, and Armand, also symbolize the outsider, the misunderstood person that lives within every man and woman.  When Louis boldly tells the interviewer, ""I'm flesh and blood, but not human,"" he is saying that although people are not all alike, they all must face trials in life, and all have the ability to feel the same emotions as each other. This statement represents the theme of the entire movie.
Although ""Interview"" is probably not for everyone, I gave it a five star rating for its unique portrayal of vampires, and of life.  Although the plot might not appeal to everybody, anybody should be able to appreciate depth in the characters, and the film as a whole.",982627200,2,1593,5.1038461538461535

That's how Tom Cruise moved into the picture. It is a remarkable film with beautiful actors. And yet the story does not get onto the rails of any sequel. Why ? Because it does not reach the mythical level Anne Rice is so great at bringing out in her Vampires Chronicles. It does not even give us the deep feeling of historical time that we get in the book and that is the discriminating touch of those Vampire Chronicles. So it is reduced to an action and adventure film, which does not correspond at all to Anne Rice's project. For instance the voodoo scene is essential to link the vampires to the deepest layers of human consciousness, history and fears. In the film it is reduced to some folkloric panic and some rebellion against a nearly insignificant course of events. The film is beautiful but it betrays Anne Rice and it does not open the door to the sequence of events and points of view.

They eat rats, gross!  Not scary. Isn't that what a movie about vampires is supposed to be? Dark Shadows in the 60s was scarier than this piece of junk. I agree with whoever wrote the review about feeling sorry for them and yes we should feel sorry for them getting in this movie. ( ditto to whoever said this) I think the poeple that wrote such good reveiews were just dazzled by Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise's good looks. I think also the book was more gay oriented so if it had included that, none of these straight people would have written such great reviews and if there had been unknowns in this movie nobody would have cared about this movie. Brad Pitt's character is a little sympathetic and you do feel a little sorry for him Kristen Dunst does a great job in her role. Bottom line though, is the movie is long, boring, drags and does not keep you on the edge of your seat being scared. I used to have nightmares with Dark Shadows, the old 60s soap and this doesn' even come close. Try Silence of the Lambs if you want to be scared.

93911,4,0790729687,"This film, based on a novel and screenplay by Anne Rice is rather different from most vampire movies. This is a film told from the point of view of the vampire rather than from that of his victims or those who set  out to destroy him.
It is not a traditional horror film and, unlike the  majority of vampire films, it is not really frightening. This is mostly  because we never actually get to relate to any of the victims of the  vampires. They are all just unknown, anonymous people playing convenient  walk on parts.
Instead, the film focuses on the life of a vampire. What  is it like to be immortal? How to reconcile former human feelings with the  constant need to kill in order to achieve immortality? What does it mean to  select another person to be initiated as a vampire? These are the major  preoccupations for the vampires in the film.
The film concentrates on  Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) and follows him from his vampire  beginnings in New Orleans to modern San Francisco. Unlike most vampire  films, he is depicted as a person with feelings of his own as are his  creator Lestat (Tom Cruise), their joint creation the child vampire Claudia  and Armand, the oldest vampire (Antonio Banderas).
The story is told  through the means of an interview with a young journalist played by  Christian Slater.
The phrase ""star studded"" hardly begins to  describe the cast list for this film and the whole movie has a feel of a  large budget which has been well spent. The only thing lacking seemed to be  that, while the film had a lot of action, it had little real atmosphere of  the sort found in, for example, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" by Werner  Herzog.
The film is fast paced with action all the way but there is  little in the way of plot or mystery. You know pretty well all the time  what is likely to happen next. That only detracts a little from what is one  of the best vampire films around. If you like this film, I'd recommend the  Herzog film mentioned above.",964310400,6,1982,4.4692737430167595
93912,4,0790729687,"All right, I won't bore you with a lot of technical details about the DVD edition of this movie. Yes, the sound and picture are great.

Tom Cruise. They both looked great  in their roles, but they sounded really bad. Also, why was everybody  speaking English? Dude, they're in late 18th-century New Orleans and Paris.  These freaks would have all spoken French, right? Well, now the movie's  perfect. All you have to do is crank up the French-language track on the  DVD, sit back, and watch the sparks fly. BOOM! What a great movie now that  it's in French! (Okay, fine. So their lips don't quite match the French  dialogue coming out of their mouths. Be that way. It's close enough. That's  why I gave if four stars instead of five, since it's maybe still not  totally perfect.) For those of you who haven't seen the movie, it's  opulent, gorgeous, lush, sexy, a little scary, and all that other good  stuff.

Unless of course you're French, in which case you  can skip the first part and just watch it in French right off the bat. This  movie is good.",964051200,3,1339,4.426229508196721
93913,5,0790729687,"Very rarely do films compare with their literary counterparts, being that movies simply cannot reach the psychological perimeter that first and third-person novels attain. There is no delving into the plotting brains of  the conniving villains and even the whole-hearted protaganists. We're left  wondering what they're thinking, no matter how good an actor it is that's  playing their part. This movie, however, kept my attentions without falling  short of expectation or accuracy in adaptation. The cinematography, set  design, special effects make-up and immaculate 19th-century attire were  luscious and realistic. The time period is vivid and beautiful, even when  we are viewing it in the darkest of midnights throughout the movie. Colors  are slightly neutralized and the faces are as clean and beautiful as we  would expect them to be.
Tom Cruise is sensational as the debonaire and  malevolent Lestat, an other-worldly creature with lingering grace, extreme  vanity and a zealous motivation for murder. A velvet tongue and feminine  sophistication, he lures both men and women alike into his arms, whispering  sweet nothings and seducing their lives away.
Kirsten Dunst is sheer  perfection as Claudia, the ageless angel of death with the visage of a  doll-like porcelain beauty. Her voice was literally the sweet tinkle of a  silver bell, a description recited quite a few times in the novel. Beneath  her powdery complexion and innocent, rosy-lipped smiles lies a gratuitous  penchant for blood, the core of her survival and ultimately her outlet for  her hatred of Lestat.
Louis is the tortured soul, a remorseful creation  full of woes and self-loathing. Brad Pitt definetely had the beauty the  character called for - the long, silky brunette hair, the chiseled features  and the sorrowful but lovely gaze with his brilliant viridian eyes (they're  actually blue, but the green contacts were interesting). Pitt did a  wonderful job with his role, but I think Cruise and Dunst blew him out of  the rink. The villians are always more fun, anyway.
Where the story line  comes into play, there is no falling short of detail, with a few minor  exceptions in the beginning. People who have read the re-popularized novel  by Anne Rice will know what those fine details are, but in the end they  aren't of any significance to what rightfully remained. There are quotes  pulled directly from the book that fall in just the right places without  sounding trite or contrived. The old superstitions (stake in the heart, no  reflection in mirrors) are stamped out with more realistic beliefs, such as  the undead being consumed by flames and sunlight, but there are some  interesting twists added, such as the imbibing of blood with inactive red  and white cells, or blood from corpses, to put it simply (""dead  blood"").
Now, a compliment to the heart-racing and emotionally  driven soundtrack, orchestrated by a collossal talent named Eliot  Goldenthal. The soundtrack for this movie, I think, is his greatest  achievement so far in musical composition and originality. It has the glory  of a ballroom scene in late 1800's New Orleans with the suffocating  corsets, rouged cheeks and blanched wigs. The score stabs and swipes in  harmony with moments of tension, the perfect example being Claudia's  explosion of rage, accompanied by Goldenthal's piece entitled  ""Claudia's Allegro Agitato"". Listen and watch, and you'll be  amazed at how perfectly the score compliments each scene.
I have only one  qualm with this film, and this is why I only rank it four and three-quarter  stars - Antonio Banderas. This was the only casting mistake. Don't get me  wrong, he wasn't bad, but he wasn't a good character representation for  Armand. Armand is almost a child. He was seventeen when he was created,  therefore has a very child-like face. Plus, he's Italian. Why a  30-year-old, Spanish-speaking actor? I don't get it...
I imagine in her  personal viewing of the film before it hit theaters, Anne Rice had only one  regret: the letter she personally penned to Tom Cruise begging him to pull  out of the role of Lestat. Now that's egg on her face...or should I say  blood?",963273600,3,4170,5.088757396449704

Interview  With A Vampire is lavish and viscerally entertaining - with a strong Cruise  - but also self-indulgent and dragging at times, with a misplaced Pitt (too  much pin-up boy despite immense acting qualities). The set design is a  triumph - bringing Blade Runner (1982) to mind in vastness.
The ending is  ambivalant - it finally ends, the movie has dragged for a while at this  point - yet watching Cruise demonically laughing and pumped up - showing an  edge we would only later see him display in the gem Magnolia (2000) - to  the raunching tunes of Guns N' Roses' original and splendid cover of the  old Stones song Sympathy For The Devil - feels like the opening to a great  vampire/horror flick.

93952,4,0790729687,"I haven't cared very much for Anne Rice's recent books, but her earlier work was outstanding. I loved ""Interview"" in particular, so I was really looking forward to this movie. There is always a risk in adapting  such a vivid and powerful-not to mention beloved-book into a film. Director  Neil Jordan and his collaborators have succeeded marvelously, though. This  is an exciting, engaging film; remarkably faithful to Rice's original text.
The story opens in present day San Francisco. Louis (Brad Pitt), a 200  year-old vampire, is telling his life story to an interviewer (Christian  Slater), who is shocked by his supernatural revelation. ""I am flesh  and blood,"" Louis tells him, ""but not human.""
His story  takes us back to late 18th century New Orleans where Louis first  encountered the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Desiring a companion, and in  love with his beautiful looks, Lestat gives Louis the ""Dark  Gift""-that is, he makes him into a vampire. They live together for  many years, roaming the streets at night, united by their common quest for  blood.
Eventually, though, Lestat fears that Louis is going to leave him.  Desperate, he makes a vampire of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a beautiful young  child, knowing the Louis would never leave the girl. Thus they are bonded  together as ""one big, happy family."" As it turns out, though,  they are not so happy after all.
The story takes the vampires to Paris,  where they finally encounter some more of their own kind. The coven of  vampires is led by the stunningly handsome Armand (Antonio Banderas) who  quickly falls in love with Louis. Louis is enamored of him as well, but he  will never leave little Claudia, something Armand realizes.
The film ends  back in the present in a departure from Rice's book. The new twist is  exciting, though, and sets up the story for an inevitable sequel. It hasn't  been made yet, but if it ever is, I'm looking forward to it.
The big  question, of course, is, how is Tom Cruise as Lestat? In one word:  brilliant. This is one of his best performances ever, heightened by the  fact that he is playing a role so different from his typical screen  persona. Cruise has always been an underrated actor, but hopefully that  will start to change after people see him here. He is terrific.
The rest  of the performances are also quite good. Brad Pitt does very well as the  tortured, guilt-ridden Louis. Antonio Banderas is extraordinary as the  seductive, young master of darkness. His is the most convincing portrayal  of a vampire, filled with power and charisma.
Neil Jordan's direction is  top-notch. Visually, ""Vampire"" is stunning, helped considerably  by Dante Ferretti's superb production design. Anyone who has read the  book-and anyone who has not-is sure to enjoy this haunting, erotic treat.",960681600,102,2798,4.931330472103005
93953,4,0790729687,"This is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, because even though there is some comic relief here and there, this movie takes itself very seriously.  Since it deals with a fantasy subject, it is nice to see a  script that is so well written that it has the power to make you believe  for the 2 hours you will spend with it.  Another thing this movie has going  for it is the art direction, the sets, and the music, they are all  wonderful and add the the dark mood of the movie.  Tom Cruise does a nice  acting job.  It is obvious that Brad Pitt has improved since his  performance in this (such as Fight Club).  I gave it 4 stars, because not  everyone will enjoy the endless blood flow and darkness that comes with a  vampire movie.

You just watched  cruise and pitt walk around and drink the blood of every living creature.  And then pitt would feel so bad about it which is supose to make us feel  bad for him. Well I tell you one thing it didn't work. The only reason I  feel bad for cruise and pitt is because they were stupid enough to agree to  be in this movie. It wasn't their acting that was bad it was the story.  Their acting was o.k. Pitt was good he had the right kind of creepyness to  him in the beginning but that is it. Like I said the only thing I really  liked about the movie was the makeup.

From there on the story unfolds as Louis  tells his tail . He was a vampire , and was made so by Tom Cruises chareter  Lestat.

Loui's charecter is probably the most basic charecter . He was easily  manipulated first by Tom Cruise then by Christan Dunst . I think Brad Pitt  aws probabaly the worst actor in the movie.

93980,5,0790729687,"I can not say for certain what most people's reactions to ""Interview with the Vampire"" will be.  Some love it, (not necessarily fans of the books), some find it a fluffy piece of fun and still others find it a dark  piece of horror. I have read all of the books in Anne Rice's vampire  chronicles. And I agree with the author's delight with the cinematic  version of her story. It captured the sensuous mood of her book perfectly.

If you want to know a little bit more about the novel then check  out the area I have put aside for it in the Authors page. The vampires are  portrayed less as demons and more as tormented artists in the medium of  predation. ""Interview with the Vampire"" is depicted from the  point of view of Louis, (Brad Pitt). He is a young vampire, made by Lestat,  (Tom Cruise), who is portrayed as a capricious, self centered, secretive  and powerful figure that dominates Louis's life.

Lestat, with  Louis, is trying to live a normal, semi-human existence but the urgency of  this desire is like a prison for the tormented Louis. Just as Louis seems  ready to break free, Lestat uses a momentary weakness, on the part of  his  partner, to create a vampiric daughter for the pair of them.

In  the end even this is not enough. Louis and his ""daughter"",  Claudia attempt to destroy their creator and flee New Orleans to seek the  legendary vampires of Europe. There they find a coven, lead by the  charismatic Armand, who tries, (due to very complex motivation, not shown  in the movie), to seduce Louis. This event climaxes in an orgy of  destruction as the coven is destroyed by Louis in revenge for the murder of  his Daughter.

The movie version of ""Interview with the  Vampire"", is very close to the novel but it does have a completely  different ending which will force further divergences from Anne Rice's work  as the movies continue. I look forward to the sequel, as the second book,  ""The Vampire Lestat"", was even better than the first.",957657600,,1969,4.558739255014327

93983,4,0790729687,"As an Anne Rice fan, I thought this movie was very well done, even though they did change certain things from the book version and left some things out. I thought all of the actors did an excellent job. Antonio was quite  unlike the Armand in the book, but I still thought he did a great job of  portraying Armand's dark, manipulative, and  seductive side. Tom Cruise was  terrific at portraying the cocky, yet charismatic, Lestat, and Brad and  Kirsten were excellent as Louis and Claudia. The scenery was fantastic and  really made me feel like I was seeing New Orleans as it was back in those  days. The costumes were all beautiful and the make-up job on the vampires  was great. I love Rice's vampires because they are completely different  than any others we have known, such as Dracula and Nosferatu. I love them  for their ""human-ness"" and the way that they are really not all  that different from us. For as Anne Rice says, the movie isn't really about  vampires. It's really about us. I love the part at the beginning when Louis  is in the bar exchanging words with another man, and the camera moves  upward to the top of the stairs. We see Lestat's left hand resting on the  railing, as he quietly watches the goings-on below. We immediately know  what he is thinking. Then, moments later, when Louis is walking with the  prostitute, we see Lestat suddenly appear there watching them as they pass  on by. That was great! My only real disappointment was at the end when  Lestat ends up with Daniel (Christian Slater) in his car. I'm sorry they  didn't stick to the book's ending, instead of drastically changing it to  something totally different. I also thought Louis' time with Armand would  have been interesting to watch. I really love the soundtrack, with its  dark, yet beautiful melodies. Libera Me is just haunting. Whenever I drive  to San Francisco, I make sure to play it as I drive over the bridge!

It is a combination of horror/drama  that manages to expose so many humanistic dilemmas that I doubt will be  surpassed any time soon.

And I can probably say I have ok taste for movies.  Or let's just say in order to keep my in my see, it's gotta be good.
The cast was grand.  The best actors and et cetera.  First I thought Tom  Cruis was horrible for the part until i watched for the 5th time then bam!  I loved him!  And as for Pitt as Louis, it was just perfect.  PERFECTO!  trust me on that.  There's rumors that Louis was portrayed more innocent  than he really was in the book. That I don't know, but I loved him the most.  And also like the other 14 yr old reader, I didn't think Antonio fitted  Armand too well.  Obviously becuase the hair color was wrong and the age is  WAY wrong and i'm not too sure about the accent.  Onto christen dunst.  I  was amazed at her acting! IT is really great to see such talented young  actors....though she's probbaly older than me. I admire her affectionately.  And Slater was great as Malloy.

I had to view the movie as a movie on its own & stop  comparing it throughout to the novel. They're both great. Who would have  thought Cruise would make such a great Lestat?
I hope they do make a  movie version of ""The Vampire Lestat""---although, I think that  would be better as a television miniseries----that way they wouldn't have  to cut so much out.",933206400,,890,4.244047619047619
94102,5,0790729687,"I'm in the minority in that I liked the movie more than the book. The book is long winded and bogged down with description and the movie starts that way too. But once Claudia is introduced, the movie spins with action,  depth, and spooky bliss. The settings are beautiful, the costumes terrific,  the characters superbly portrayed. The soundtrack is hard to beat, but only  if you're cultured in your music tastes. The altered ending is - at least  to me - refreshing. Axl Rose singing Jagger's Sympathy for the Devil is a  fitting ending for the movie that glorified Lestat. And of course Lestat  himself was beautifully portrayed by Tom Cruise. This is a must see for any  serious vampire fan.",931392000,,695,4.694214876033058
94103,5,0790729687,What can i say I love this movie. The vary first time i saw this movie i was enthralled by it.  Though I always find mysalf wishing for a happier end for louie but I know the movie would loses its majestic quality if it  did. I love the poetic way Lestat speakes and the way Louie well... is. I  love the development of all the characters.  And contrary to what one of  the people below me will say Tom Crusie is the only one you could ever  picture as Lestat. Its a whole new concept for him and he excels at it. And  Brad Pitt my god you coulden't ask for better.  I'll admit that not only is  this movie great but the stars are hott. I always find mysalf wishing I  were Kirsten Dunst. This movie in truth is a must have for any collection.  It is deep but manages to maintain a playful adittude. BUY IT!!!!!! :D :P  :D,930614400,,822,4.006172839506172

I bought the movie a year ago, and it rarelly  leaves my VCR.  This one is a keeper for sure!",920246400,,272,3.8035714285714284
