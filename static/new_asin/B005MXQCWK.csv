4839072,4,B005MXQCWK,"I love love love Tara Stiles. She is basically my all time yoga idol, so of course, I bought her 2 new DVD's for Christmas. I just did this routine yesterday, and I really liked it. It's great for beginners, but for more advanced yogis and athletes (I put myself in the latter. I am not really good at yoga, but I love it and my trainer advised me to start to improve my flexibility. I am, however, a devoted athlete.) It was great and stimulating, and I did it right before hopping on my bed to read. It felt really great. However, this really didn't fit the ""weight loss"" description found on the cover of the DVD. Aside from that, this is great for beginners, and just a good routine in general. Loved it! Tara has done it again. I have yet to cover the meditation (still meditating on my own ever morning), but I'm sure Deepak is amazing. Great DVD!",1324684800,4,853,4.271604938271605
4839073,5,B005MXQCWK,"I really enjoyed this yoga DVD.  I have not done the meditation so cannot speak to that yet.

Tara Stiles leads the ""class"" live rather than via voiceover.  The class takes place outside with three participants.

It is 50 minutes long but the last 5 minutes is Savasanna.

Poses I remember are: thread the needle, warrior 2, warrior 1, low lunge, reverse warrior, chair, tree, squat, side planks, bridge, half pigeon and regular pigeon, and lots of twists.  There are also a lot of chatarungas and upward facing dogs, downward facing dogs, and standing forward bends.  There are a lot of variations and modifications mentioned.  The music is very very mellow.

The flow is very nice but you do work up a little sweat.  Some poses I noticed not included are: crow,  warrior 3, pose of the dancer, boat, bow, eagle, balancing stick, shoulder stands, and plow.

I think this is much more doable than the new york sessions from Tara Stiles and I can't wait to try the other new one she came out with this past Tuesday.  Thanks, Tara!",1323302400,20,1029,4.6187845303867405
4839074,5,B005MXQCWK,"I consider myself an advanced beginner as far as yoga is concerned, and I loved this video.  The flow was smooth and easy to follow with instructions by Tara throughout the video.  Several modifications were offered which makes it great for all levels.  I own several Yoga DVD's and I never really got into any of them, but I will be adding this one into my workout rotation.  Keep them coming Tara!",1323216000,4,399,4.5
4839075,4,B005MXQCWK,Really enjoyed it!! This is my go to yoga class on Amazon.,1463529600,,58,3.9166666666666665
4839076,5,B005MXQCWK,This will whoop your butt into shape! really noticed my legs and arms tone up after just a few sessions.,1453593600,,104,4.25
4839077,1,B005MXQCWK,This would be great if someone was already a Yoga master. no explanation of moves. I would need to watch (not do) for hours before even attempting.,1453593600,4,147,4.481481481481482
4839078,1,B005MXQCWK,"Why do ""weight loss"" programs always use tiny, thin, flexible, young people in their videos???? If you are overweight, you can't even do half the poses. It would help a lot to see other overweight people and how the poses can be modified to be done until such time as one actually loses the weight. Seriously.",1448582400,3,309,4.535714285714286
4839079,5,B005MXQCWK,"Tara Stiles has been praised and also criticized for the manner/style of her Yoga instruction.  Some say her practice moves to quickly(not really, just the 'style' of Yoga she instructs), the quality of the dvd  isn't good( I did notice bad sound quality in a spot or two but wasn't anything to feel upheaval about), the fact she doesnt actually practice but only instructs the others who are demonstrating ( so?), or that she says, "" awesome, you guys,"" like 2,578 times to her demonstrators...ok, I guess it could get irritating to some but I concentrated on the Yoga instead and liked the praise, actually! I read all the reviews, negative and positive, and decided to give her a try.
I've practiced Kundalini Yoga since 2009 and thought a new branch of Yoga might be interesting to try and I absolutely loved Tara's  DVD! She doesn't bring that deep spirituality into her practice, unlike Kundalini, but she is not instructing Kundalini so that can be put to rest.
The flow of her practice is perfect and I seriously lost 4 pounds the first week I started, practicing this dvd once a day. I slowed it down a bit now to 3 times a week because I am petite, only weighing 103lbs to begin with, and lost down to 99lbs! I really can't afford to keep losing so I had to cut back. (BTW: despite the fact that I'm small, I have a very slow metabolism and really have to be strict with my diet and watch everything I eat because I literally gain weight if I look at something fattening).  This definitely works, the flow is nice and it takes under an hour from start to finish, AND you feel much more flexible after.
Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to lose a few pounds fast, become more flexible, and transform their body into beautiful and lean.",1446940800,2,1752,4.5
4839080,2,B005MXQCWK,"I'm glad I rented this from the library first, I have heard a lot about Tara in the yoga world and have always been curious. But her teaching style did not work for me. She said ""awesome you guys"" and, ""great you guys"" so much my husband was in the other room laughing. There really just wasn't a lot to it, she just ran you through the poses, not a lot of alignment or instruction given.",1437091200,2,388,4.118421052631579
4839081,5,B005MXQCWK,Thank you,1431561600,,9,4.0
4839082,3,B005MXQCWK,Also not as tough as I thought it would be.  Not sure how anyone would use this for weight loss?  But it's a lovely stretch and a beautiful way to unwind.,1429660800,,154,3.935483870967742
4839083,5,B005MXQCWK,"You will hear the phrase ""Awesome you guys"" a lot during this DVD - but, she's right - it's definitely awesome. I'm 40 & going through some fairly major hormone & thyroid issues that caused me to gain a lot of weight. I'm athletic & eat a very clean vegan diet(no soy, no gluten) but was unable to get the scale to budge. I hadn't done yoga seriously for several years but I always liked how my brain & body felt when I was doing it regularly. I heard about Tara & liked her approach & attitude - I figured, hey, if I'm gonna be a fatty, at least let me a be a bendy relaxed fatty...but why not just try the dvd for weight loss, right? So, damn - after the FIRST time I lost a pound...& another the next day...& so forth. Prior to this I had thought my scale was stuck at the same unpleasant number (I actually bought a NEW scale at one point I was so suspicious). I am insanely pleased with the results. It's length (50 minutes - which is perfect & not so easy to find - 20 or 90 minutes seems to be most of what's out there with not much in between) & difficulty (again, most of what's available for home use is either super beginner or super advanced - I'm neither & this is doable with room to grow) make it extremely friendly for everyday use. Highly recommended!",1421625600,22,1268,4.116935483870968

4839088,5,B005MXQCWK,"This video is really quite good. I found it easy to follow with only a few slight annoyances that are easily overlooked. But then I've been doing yoga for over 10 years. I would not suggest this for a beginner as the instruction is not geared toward people just starting out. But for those who are familiar with yoga it offers a great series that is challenging without being too difficult. Tara's instructions make it easy for you to follow without having to look at the screen very often, if at all. I agree, she does speak quickly and, yes, says ""awesome guys"" quite a bit. But again, this is not for beginners and the makers should have labeled it as such. As for her repeating ""awesome guys,"" it makes me feel as if I'm getting a boost to keep me going. As an aside, for anyone who is a beginner to yoga, DVDs are nice as a supplement to a practice but I suggest taking some classes before jumping into them. That's where you'll get the real instruction, become more familiar with the poses and what your body can do, and gain strength and flexibility.",1409702400,4,1057,4.3979591836734695

4839092,3,B005MXQCWK,"I've been doing yoga for over a year now, and this would not be my first option forma begginer. I wouldnt call it a 'weightloss' series, but its still good. I did gain some strength on my arms.

Now the 'meditation' part is useless, its just Deepak Chopra driving around in the desert.",1403827200,3,285,4.377358490566038
4839093,5,B005MXQCWK,"I love this DVD. There's another DVD in this series (Strength and Energy), and this is the more gentle of the two. I do this workout right after work on Friday, and it's a nice way to unwind into the weekend. Beginners should probably watch the video once or twice before doing the workout, as she tends to call the poses by their names instead of leading you through every step. I appreciate that, since I'm not new to the practice don't need the explanation, especially once you've done the routine a few times and know it by heart. I highly recommend this workout (as well as Strength and Energy, which is a little more intense).",1403395200,,632,4.456896551724138
4839094,1,B005MXQCWK,"I rented this.  Thank goodness I didn't buy it.

Tara Stiles needs a vocal coach.  She speaks WAY too fast.  Her vocal pattern is beyond annoying.  She also says ""awesome you guys"" over and over to the students in the DVD or ""awesome.""

I wanted to like this. It's filmed in a desert, which is very pretty. The music is very nice.  I like the idea of meditation and yoga on the same DVD.  The concept for the DVD is great.

However, this is one of the absolute worst yoga DVDs I've ever used because of Tara Stiles poor presentation skills.

There are far better yoga DVDs out there. Do not waste your money on this one.",1402790400,4,620,4.222222222222222
4839095,5,B005MXQCWK,Excellent selection.  I highly recommend this video to all Yoga lovers. It is easy to follow and you get a good work out.,1400803200,,121,4.260869565217392

4839100,5,B005MXQCWK,"To date- this is my favorite yoga DVD. I keep finding and buying yoga DVDs in the hopes that they are similar to the vinyasa flow class I take- usually they leave me disappointed as most home yoga DVDs are restorative, or yoga lite, to counter balance not having a teacher to give feedback. This is the only one I've bought out of about 15 that I have absolutely loved and have no complaints. She's a phenomenal teacher and gives a great practice in the DVD- love the Deepak Chopra meditation add on, too,",1386547200,,505,4.382978723404255

4839103,4,B005MXQCWK,"I like this video right now. It makes me feel better after doing it, but I'm somewhat out of shape, so I think that as I get back into shape I'll like it more and more.

4839104,4,B005MXQCWK,"It works my body to the point of sweating, every effective session.  But where is Deepak, he's no where in this DVD except the credits. Oh well, great workout.",1370563200,,159,4.482758620689655
4839105,5,B005MXQCWK,"I REALLY really like this yoga routine, because of how i feel when it is over. I am a physical therapist that has always been athletic.  I have a curve in my spine from one leg being shorter than the other and muscle imbalances due to the curve and the unequal leg length.  Unfortunately I have had to slow down on my running due to suffering with back pain regularly.  But this yoga routine is very balancing, stretching and lengthening for the spine and all the hip and sacral muscles.  I would give it 4.5 stars if possible because she does move a little fast and she says ""awesome you guys"" way too much. But I control the speed by keeping the remote close by to pause when I need longer in a pose. This is probably not for the non athletic yoga beginner, more of an intermediate level unless you are quite strong and flexible and then you could start here.  I have Rodney Yee: Power Yoga also and I like how he instructs on inhale and exhale where Tara Stiles does not focus much on the breathing. But if you've done other yoga then you can incorporate it here.  I do recommend this especially for balancing the spinal posture!",1367798400,,1132,4.341232227488152
4839106,3,B005MXQCWK,"a bit fast for beginner, and i prefer to see Tara doing it rather than other girls doing under Tara's guiding.",1361923200,,110,4.285714285714286
4839107,5,B005MXQCWK,"If you're looking for a yoga practice you can do from home without feeling crummy for not being a pretzel, get this video.  Tara's teaching style is relaxed, laid-back, yet stimulating.  I truly enjoy this practice anytime I can't get to my favorite studio.",1358553600,,257,4.818181818181818
4839108,3,B005MXQCWK,"While the moves are basic and flow well, many of the poses would be difficult for anyone carrying much extra weight. It would have been helpful to have at least one bigger person demonstrating the poses. Some poses were modified, but having thin people do them doesn't help us bigger people very much.",1357171200,19,301,4.69811320754717
4839109,4,B005MXQCWK,"...was pretty easy to follow for the most part. Just wish there was more close ups of the more challenging poses..it was also a little hard to follow at first because I am a beginner and when I looked at the three people who were doing these poses they were all doing a pose in differnt ways ...probably because some are more advanced than others...

Overall, I am enjoying this video and think it is good to add into your routine.",1356998400,,431,4.320987654320987
4839110,4,B005MXQCWK,"I like this DVD.  I have taken yoga before, so it isn't completely new, but I'm surprised by the critical reviews here.  Just take it easy.  It's supposed to feel good.  If you don't understand, look up and watch.  Next time, try it.  Look again as many times as necessary until if feels better. I have no idea whether it helps you to loose weight.  My only comment is that I would appreciate more instruction or theory on the meditation.  I think the yoga part was good.",1351468800,2,471,4.333333333333333
4839111,5,B005MXQCWK,"I don't understand the less than stellar reviews on this product. I'm used to doing the yoga that Tara posts on youtube and I am certainly a beginner. I found this easy to follow, easy to hear, easy to understand. I also think the meditation section and the explanations of how yoga and meditation work and help you are wonderful! I was surprised at the length (i believe around 50 mins) and the additional features. I feel like I got a GREAT deal.",1348358400,6,448,4.409638554216867
4839112,1,B005MXQCWK,"This is definitely not for beginners. It is a more advanced yoga class which has been videotaped. The students already know what they are doing, so if you are already familar with the poses, you guys might find this dvd awesome. It is not a teaching video because it is too fast to learn. Unprofessional with too many, ""awesome you guys"" spoken. I would have appreciated the dvd stating that it is not for beginners. This dvd would be awesome if it was shot over, taught slowly, with a professional script. On the bright side, Tara Stiles is beautiful and knowlegeable. I would love to have a body like hers -- wish I could follow this dvd!",1348272000,8,640,4.478632478632479

4839114,1,B005MXQCWK,I expected much more from a product that Chopra endorsed and participated in but I was very disappointed. This DVD is nothing more than an elementary yoga demo tape with very little instruction. The weight loss advice was of the same level of value. There was nothing new on this DVD and I strongly advise no one to buy it. There are many cheaper and more detailed DVDs' on yoga available.,1344470400,3,389,4.492957746478873
4839120,4,B005MXQCWK,I like this DVD. It explains all parts of yoga; from the poses to the importance of the breath. I thought Deepak would be a little more invovled though. Tara makes it easy to want to do yoga.,1341100800,,191,4.052631578947368
4839121,5,B005MXQCWK,"I've only done this once and it does not seem as intense as her other yoga dvds but it a nice change of pace.  Beautiful scenery, interesting commentary  and meditation by Chopra. Very soothing for when life is hectic.",1336608000,,218,4.564102564102564
4839122,1,B005MXQCWK,What a disappointment. Yoga instructor mumbles something very fast and mainly to herself. You definitely can lose weight - mainly by getting more and more irritated!,1334361600,9,165,5.384615384615385
4839123,5,B005MXQCWK,"I would say this dvd is ""awesome"", but Tara kind of turned me off of saying that when I heard her use it over and over in this dvd....that would be my only ""con"" on a really well put together dvd.  I like yoga and I do it at least once or twice a week to keep flexible and to get that great ""balanced"" feeling that only yoga can provide to me.  I have never done Tara Stiles, but have done Rodney Yee, Erich Schiffman, Yoga Zone, Brian Kest, Sara Ivanhoe & Shiva Rea.  The thing about yoga is each teacher brings something unique and their own twist to this ancient practice, so it gives me a variety to fit my mood.

Tara's practice I would consider to be at an intermediate level and is about 50 minutes long.  There are the normal, classic poses, chair, up dog, down dog, warrior one & two, twists, bridge/wheel, pigeon and many others.  I thought this dvd flowed really well and I loved the twists, that really helped me relax along with, (as always) the deep breathing, which is the key in any yoga program.  The dvd is beautifully shot, in a desert background and the music is calming without being too low-key or too overwhelming.  Tara has three exercisers that demonstrate the poses and she points out form but she does not do the poses herself.  For some people this kind of style is not what they may want, however I felt it really fit and it didn't bother me in the least.  The poses were easy to follow and my hubby also joined in (he does yoga intermittently) and he loved the dvd and wanted to know if I would be purchasing it (highly likely). If you can do the routine without instruction (I personally find this difficult, as I don't know how one would know when to come out of down dog, etc), there is the option to do the dvd muted, with only the music and no instruction.  Not for me, but nice option to have if the instruction bugs you.

The dvd also includes a 15 minute meditation sequence.  This is led by Deepak Chopra.  He speaks briefly at the beginning and then it is quiet with only music and changing scenery.  If there was a drawback in this section I would say that the scenery is so pretty that I kept my eyes open for half the time so I wouldn't miss anything instead of closing my eyes like I normally would.  Oh, who cares though, as long as my mind is empty of thoughts and I'm relaxing, right?

The dvd also includes segments where Deepak Chopra and Tara Stiles talk about yoga, breath, flow and mindfulness about food.  I found it interesting and would recommend watching this at some point to get a full picture.  It most definitely does not need to be watched prior to doing the exercises.

Overall, a really good dvd.  I liked the flow, loved the music, scenery and the way I felt when I finished the yoga and meditation.  If you are looking to try something new and you have done yoga in the past I would recommend.  If you are an absolute beginner, I would recommend a more basic dvd, just to learn the poses and then work into this one.  Otherwise, I would wholeheartedly recommend and am most likely going to purchase this item for myself to add to my yoga practice.",1332547200,40,3112,4.298456260720411
4839124,5,B005MXQCWK,"I can't tell you that this yoga routine will help you lose weight, as I have only had the DVD a short while. I can tell you that the instruction is clear and the routine is well demonstrated, including revised versions for beginners. I can also say that the poses are easy enough for beginners, but can be taken to a very challenging level. Deepak Choprah is, as always, clear, concise, and miraculously calming in his explanations of the benefits of yoga and meditation. This is a very inspiring, and yet accessible program. Strongly recommend!",1330992000,5,545,4.747368421052632
4839125,2,B005MXQCWK,"I am really not a fan of this DVD.  The instructor doesn't do the asanas herself, but assists the other people, correcting their postures.  The main problems with this is that you have to constantly be looking at the tv to see whats going on. She corrects the womens postures but doesn't explain this really to the viewer in a way we can ensure we are doing it correctly.  I find she also talks really fast and it just starts feeling like annoying chatter, its not relaxing.  She doesnt engage with the viewer, it is just like you are watching a video of someone teaching a yoga class to their students rather than teaching you.  The setting is nice and the music is quite relaxing but the way that Tara teaches on this DVD is really not for me.",1330387200,26,745,4.330935251798561

I should either keep looking at the screen to see or I will not be able to understand anything, as all she keeps saying is 'awesome guys'. She didn't even do the part with 'music only' herself!

After I promptly turned the DVD off, I looked up the instructor online only to find that her credentialing may be dubious and her first career was a runway model. That explained it all. I returned it for another yoga program.",1324857600,6,421,4.626666666666667
8479967,5,B005MXQCWK,This DVD is for intermediate users in my opinion.  Ive been doing yoga for 5 yrs and was sweating when finished with entire routine.  Beautiful scenery.  Apriciate the help with meditation Deepak gives.  I struggle keeping my mind quiet and this DVD helps.,1527724800,,256,4.883720930232558
8479968,5,B005MXQCWK,Great yoga dvd!! Ive tried many at home and am usually disappointed but this is just as good as going to yoga class but in the comfort of my home!,1524096000,,146,3.9
8479969,1,B005MXQCWK,Instructor repeated nice you guys and awesome you guys like a teenager every other sentence. It was so distracting that I stopped the dvd after 15 minutes. Awful. The dvd looked like a home video/bootleg copy. Do not purchase.,1519430400,,226,4.82051282051282
8479970,3,B005MXQCWK,"Some of the spoken instruction is a bit distracting with Tara Stiles constantly saying ""awesome"", but it's not bad enough to not do the workout.",1517788800,,144,4.8
8479971,5,B005MXQCWK,I have seen a lot of yoga tapes.  Tara is awesome and everyone should be so lucky to watch deepak before or after doing Yoga.  Its the best yoga tape I've ever seen!! I wish the cost of shipping were cheaper though.,1494633600,,215,4.095238095238095
8479972,5,B005MXQCWK,"I have never reviewed a product publicly, but because I love this particular DVD so much, i feel compelled.  I am 48, menopausal, have yo-yo weight all my life, love to eat, and have dabbled in yoga on and off for 30 years, but NEVER stuck with it longer than 6 months.  I've taken professional paid classes from 3 different instructors and have tried over 20 yoga DVDs from the library.  Finally, 7 years ago, I tried this DVD from the library.  I was intimidated byTara Stiles' skinniness and ""granola"" look, but got through it.  Since that time 7 years ago, I have never done any other yoga routine except this one. When I consistently do it 2-3x a week, I bet the following benefits within 1-2 weeks:  Flatter stomach, much less to no hip/back pain, better digestion, stronger legs, leaner arms, much much happier mood,calmer, easier breathing, less red skin on face, better sex drive and sex in general, sounder sleep.  This is not for beginners, but if you have moderate familiarity with yoga, or are already fairly strong, it will be one of the most health beneficial DVDs you ever buy.  Well worth it.  I have bought it for 6 friends and have a backup for myself.  Stick with it for 1-2 weeks and see for yourself.  And, yes, she says awesome a lot and it's slightly annoying, but very easy to ignore considering how much better I feel when I'm finished.  Thank you, Tara, this DVD is one of the very best!",1489968000,3,1414,4.5019607843137255

8479974,4,B005MXQCWK,"I searched on you tube and pintrest and found yoga videos on Livestrong woman before buying this DVD. I am 50 years old and had taken Yoga classes a few years ago but I'm certainly no yoga expert or an athlete by any means,  I was hoping this DVD would help me with flexibility especially early in the morning , often when I wake up my back is stiff, I also want to gain flexibility so I can play on the floor with the grandkids. I really like this video, even if I only do 10 or 15 minutes in the morning it has definitely helped me and I find myself being more motivated to get up and get it done before my morning shower. I would suggest searching Taras videos on you tube to see if you like her style of instruction , that's usually a deal breaker for me in the exercise DVD dept. I would highly suggest this video if you are looking to be more flexible and the price is unbeatable. Plus Taras instruction is good and her voice is pleasant and pretty zen like.",1478649600,,964,4.1005291005291005
8479975,3,B005MXQCWK,"I absolutely love Deepak and Tara and have for years!!!  My only issue is that it is too long for me, I have limited time and really looking for shorter time frames that I can do more often.",1472169600,,190,4.0
