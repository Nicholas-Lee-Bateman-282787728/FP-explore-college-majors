8469435,5,B005F0TH1S,"I enjoyed all of the episodes in this true crime series.  I would have liked them better if they had not included narration by the dead victims; such content is speculative or hearsay that was added for entertainment purposes only, if murder and death can be considered entertainment.  However, all episodes were presented in a professional format, and contained the relevant facts about each case.  I would recommend the series to any amateur sleuth who enjoys an interesting mystery.",1388275200,3,485,5.113924050632911
