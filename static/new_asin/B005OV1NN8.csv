8482089,5,B005OV1NN8,"This DVD is a documentary about the life of Luciano Pavarotti.  More importantly, it gives the viewer a glimpse into the man himself.  And while no film can completely capture everything that there is to know about an individual like Luciano, it certainly paints a picture of the zest for life that is so apparent in his singing.

The disc features interviews with his ex-wife (most illuminating these sequences are), Bono, Jose Carreras, Herbert Breslin (who just recently passed away), as well as several others.  Each offers stories that shed insight into the positives and negatives of Mr. Pavarotti, his playfulness, love of food and female companionship, as well as his unique ability to draw and move large audiences.  When you hear clips of him singing, you just can't help but smile.  And the segment featuring Jose Carreras talking about the 2am or so call from Luciano while they were on tour is just delightful.

The video has wonderful footage that shows his home town, various opera houses, as well as some intriguing images and stories about his father, who is described as having an incredible voice as well.  This is a really fascinating film, and definitely worth watching for those that want to experience some of the magic of Luciano.  Very strongly recommended.",1340582400,,1282,4.953271028037383
8482090,5,B005OV1NN8,"The late tenor Lucciano Pavarotti loves four things more than any other: Singing, Food, Family and Women! This 2010 hour-long documentary confirms that over and over again using interviews with those who knew him intimately, including his manager of 35 years, the head of the Metropolitan Opera Company (Joseph Volpe), Pavarotti's first wife and celebrities who performed with him including Jose Carreras (another of the famous Three Tenors) and Bono from U2. In order for Pavarotti's first wife to agree to be interviewed, Director Esther Schapira had to agree not to include his other wives, including Nicolle (who was 21 when Pavarotti was 60 in 1996.

The film is narrated in German with English subtitles, but many of the interviews are in English.

There are a few archival performance clips but this is not a performance-based documentary. The Director's purpose was to show the tenor with his family and friends, mostly in Moderna, his hometown. I learned more than I thought I knew from watching this. The Bonus section includes four extended interviews (total 33 minutes) with Bono, Carreras, manager Herbert Breslin and Volpe. Volpe is the least interesting while Carreras tells some great stories.

The DVD includes a a 2 page essay by David Pattmore printed in English, French and German.

This DVD will show you a side of the tenor that you may not have known. It did for me.
