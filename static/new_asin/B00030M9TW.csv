5669644,5,B00030M9TW,"George Lakoff has broken interesting new ground at the Rockridge Institute.  The linguistics professor at the University California at Berkeley has led the movement in helping shape a new progressive political agenda after conceding that conservatives had achieved a big lead in the important realm of establishing message as a means of prevailing in ongoing debate.

Lakoff explains at the beginning of this informative DVD how Louis Powell, shortly before being appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon in 1970, launched the movement to establish an effort to seize the political agenda in American for conservatives.  Some 43 think tanks were created in the better than three decades since Powell launched his effort.  Progressives found it difficult to match the level of financial expenditures of conservatives assisted by corporate largesse, but are now in a position to claw their way back into the game and ultimately win.

The area where Lakoff contends that the major momentum was established in promoting the conservative political agenda resides generally in the message field and specifically through framing issues by the shrewd and repetitious use of language.  A strong case in point was Bush's first move after assuming the presidency.  On day one of Bush's term he sought to reward the corporate donors who had provided him with the chance to win the presidency, which ultimately occurred not through the ballot box but by a one vote Supreme Court majority, by advocating what he called ""tax relief.""

Lakoff explains that the word ""tax"" has a negative connotation to Americans, but by creating a positive metaphor such as ""tax relief"" a negative is converted to a positive.  The term conjures up a doctor providing just the right medication for a patient to feel better.  Burdens are diminished through relief.

Another area where Lakoff credits conservatives with gaining a rhetorical advantage is by using the term ""abortion"" repeatedly.  Opponents are seen as involved with killing whereas, with different framing, by referring to a woman's reproductive rights or stressing a woman's ""right to choose"" the concept of individual liberty is envisioned rather than a negative connotation.  He points out that, while conservatives extol a ""pro life"" agenda they fail to follow through in vital areas such as pre-natal care and guaranteed health care for children.  Progressives can make their case, however, only by rephrasing the labels conservatives seek to apply to a political issue.

The environment is an area where Lakoff cites a shrewd effort by conservatives to use positive language to frame a negative position that, with proper citizen reflection, he feels will redound in the favor of progressives and against Bush and his right wing adherents.  Bush repeatedly refers to his clear skies initiative, which he sought as a substitute for the Clean Air Act passed and extended by Congress for decades.  The Bush measure allows corporations to buy credits from each other for the legal permission to pollute.  Lakoff states that it is a losing proposition to accept the term of clear skies advanced by conservatives in debate.

A positive brought about through framing needs to be reversed by calling Bush's concept a dirty skies proposal, which conjures up a negative image.  To George Lakoff success is all in the framing through which the progressive presentation is made.

The terms conservatives employ in seeking acceptance for proposals must be challenged by immediately invoking alternative terms.  If the conservative uses a negative term in attempting to paint the progressive into a corner the progressive must then respond by invoking a positive term.  The same applies concerning a positive term that to liberals embodies a negative program.  Lakoff advocates reversing the terminology in favor of the progressive position.

Lakoff is optimistic about the ability of progressives to prevail as long as a winning game plan is followed, that of taking control of the agenda through framing issues in the proper winning verbal context.  The right words connote the right images, putting citizens in the mood to embrace the progressive agenda.",1098489600,56,4201,5.260869565217392
5669645,5,B00030M9TW,"This video essay on the power of words has changed the way I think.

It is about the power of words to do good and bad.

When the conservatives say gay marriage, you say love and caring long-term relationships.

When the conservatives say Clean Air Act, you always call it the Dirty Air Act. When conservatives say Healthy Forest Initiative, you say Leave No Tree Behind.

The neocons have invented a language they now use to control our thinking.

The linguist George Lakoff has helped me think about fundamentals.

Language is the thing wherein we can undo the empire of the wannabe king.",1095984000,3,590,4.679611650485437
5669646,5,B00030M9TW,"This DVD captures George Lakoff's entire point of view in an extraordinarily concise and powerful way. The editing is tight and the accompanying support graphics help make his thoughts even clearer. For all progressives who wonder why the right has been so successful at framing their ""conservative"" agenda and winning so many elections in the last 12 years here is your answer. The DVD gives the progressive movement the linguistic tools to communicate our values and vision more effectively than ever before. This DVD is a great gift to anyone who seeks to make this a better world. Buy it and pass it around. It is something really positive to do.",1095897600,52,650,4.864864864864865
8573109,4,B00030M9TW,"Lakoff made framing very understandable in this book, but how to apply it to dealing with others needs more meat not only to make it useful, but to help in explaining it to others. I tried following up in a couple of discussion groups and found people arguing about the various terms and meanings. It needs lots more examples of how to discuss a concept without repeating an opponent's terminology, for example.",1407628800,,411,4.722222222222222
8573110,3,B00030M9TW,The biggest problem I find with this DVD is that it is only 30 minutes long and just chips away at the tip of the iceberg for how to frame your arguments against conservatives. I think this movie should be re-done to offer more insight than just attacking Bush and giving some easily defeatable ideas on how to beat conservatives,1293408000,,329,4.5
8573111,5,B00030M9TW,The book describes existing political concepts and is prompted by the conservative/liberal differences. It serves as one book amongst many in describing our political environment. It does so from the liberal perspective.,1278028800,,220,5.90625
8573112,4,B00030M9TW,"The message in this video is excellent, important, and helpful in learning to frame political arguments.  The presentation however, is boring - basically a ""talking head"".  I would hope some day that a film maker might re-do the same material with video examples of good and bad framing.  A little creativity would make the message more compelling and understandable.",1181692800,,367,5.186440677966102

8573114,5,B00030M9TW,"What every Progressive candidate or backer needs to know. This short video should be required viewing before each time any progressive candidate speaks in public. How to express positions in a frame that reflects progressive values. For example, talk about ""tax fairness"" or ""investment in the future"". The phrase ""tax relief"" evokes the notion that taxes are an affliction which needs to be relieved: who could support continued infliction of such suffering? On the other hand, the  tax reduction in 2003 was $400 for an average wage-earner and 1000 times that for a CEO getting 200 times the average wage.

Is this fair?",1142208000,9,622,5.029126213592233

8573116,5,B00030M9TW,"Enlighting and informative!

Mr. Lakoff dismantles the verbal tools used by conservatives to lull an impressionable public and discusses how to counter conservative arguments.

I live in Texas and am often struck dumb by Conservative's Orwellian speech repeated by most all my friends and acquaintances.  My moral progressive arguments generally falling on deaf ears and dismissed as liberalism.

Not anymore!",1122422400,12,409,5.766666666666667
8573117,5,B00030M9TW,"How Democrats and Progressives Can Win is an outstanding production that makes a very complex subject accessible to all. Dr. Lakoff uses some current issues as examples -how the issue is communicated drives how the issue is perceived by the masses -and why.

While the production is geared toward politics -its relevance extends to all communication.

8573118,5,B00030M9TW,"George Lakoff's book 'Don't Think Of An Elephant' is a revelation on how language is used in politics and government to advance the conservative agenda. This video goes one step farther and has Lakoff himself explain the art of framing the debate.

It is nothing less than a guide on how progressive/liberals can frame the issues in their terms, something that has not happened of late.  When any group defines the issues, then the opposition, no matter what they do, is defeated.  The essence of it all is to frame the issues in your own language-say how you really feel about an issue instead of trying to explain your stance with the oppositions terminology.

This video is only 25 minutes, but it contains a wealth of clear explanation and visual examples.  For those that want to understand how language is used in politics, this is required viewing. It is a great companion to his book, especially for those who don't quite 'catch' it all after reading the book.

Highly recommended!",1109808000,14,989,4.788235294117647
