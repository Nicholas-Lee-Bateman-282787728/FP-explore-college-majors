1076047,1,6305649103,Don't buy this DVD! The quality of the transfer is really bad.  I have a VHS copy of this feature with MUCH more clarity.  Wait for someone to do the job right.  I really wish Tarzan fans could be afforded the respect of QUALITY DVDs from film producers(this is a not-so-subtle hint to all those producers of future releases).,979344000,26,326,4.491525423728813
1076048,1,6305649103,"...They couldn't pay him enough.
In a role that fits him about as well as a central casting loin cloth, Buster Crabbe cavorts among the trees as one of the worst Tarzans ever. To be fair Mr. Crabbe does what he can with  a poorly conceived mishmash of a film. His co-star, Miss Wells, while  probably considered sexy at the time, is no Jean Rogers and offers very  little in the way of interest, romantic or otherwise. The finest moment  that this movie offers is the sight of Buster Crabbe sitting astride a tree  limb, giving new meaning to the phrase, ""spanking the monkey.""",955670400,8,577,4.509615384615385

1076226,2,6305649103,"I, too, will leave observations on the quality to others.  My objection is that this is billed as a 12 Chapter Serial.  It is, in fact, an edited version of the serial into a (less than) 90 minute movie.  For a collector of serials this is not acceptable.  The whole purpose of collecting serials is to have all the amenities: the opening credits and especially the chapter title together with the recaps of the previous episode.  Don't get me wrong, if all you're after is the original serial's content, this is fine, albeit some of the transitions are poorly edited.  If you are a collector of serials, however, with all the features mentioned above, avoid this edition.  (incidentally, while I've seen this title on a couple of resources, all of them are this edited version.  I have been unable to locate the actual 12 chapter version.)",1429747200,,840,4.705479452054795

1076228,5,6305649103,"While this is an old film, and the acting is somewhat heavy handed, with the occasional long stares characteristic of silent films, it is fun to watch Buster Crabbe as Tarzan. This film was made in 1933, sometime after the first Tarzan movie in 1918. This was a time when people were still insensitive to prejudices and used stereotypes. The film portrays Arabs enslaving black and selling them to the slave trade. The blacks are depicted as foolish people. The film has two sets of villians. There are two guides who are after the $10,000 promised to the person or persons who find Tarzan dead or alive. These two also want to steal gems from a tribe. The second villains are this secret tribe of people, who live secluded, and who own an idol encrusted with precious jewels. They become vicious only when someone steals their god's gems. Curiously, they dress as Egyptians, although this has nothing to do with the story.

Tarzan is depicted as almost childless. He is unable to speak English, but he can mimic a word or two, like a parrot. He smiles and grunts a lot. He is charmed by Mary, a woman who is in the group led by the two evil men. He fearlessly fights alligators and lions and saves Mary. He issues the famous Tarzan yell from time to time, such as when he kills a lion, showing that he is successful. Jane and Boy are not in the film. A chipanzee is in the movie, but is not named Chetta and does not perfom antics as in the Weismuller versions.",1309996800,2,1462,4.434944237918216
1076229,3,6305649103,"Tarzan was created in 1912 by Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) and went on to be enormously successful not only as a series of books (24) but also in comic strips, merchandise, and in film, even spawning cities called ""Tarzana"" (California) and ""Tarzan"" (Texas).

When we think of Tarzan we think of Johnny Weissmuller, introduced to the world in 1932 in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"", the first of 12 films to star Weissmuller. He wasn't the first (Elmo Lincoln had the distinction in 1918), nor was he the only Tarzan during his reign from 1932 to 1948, but he is the most memorable. Lex Barker succeeded him in 1949 to 1953 with 5 films and Gordon Scott followed Baxter from 1955 to 1960 with 6 films, and the most memorable performance among his competitors was Christopher Lambert in ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984).

Shortly after Weissmuller began the Tarzan films, through a loophole in Burroughs' business dealings, independent producer Sol Lesser was able to film ""Tarzan the Fearless"", a 12 part serial. Unable to get Weissmuller, he got the next best thing - Weissmuller's good friend and fellow Olympic swimmer, Buster Crabbe. Crabbe (1908-83) was a Gold and Bronze winning swimmer from the 1928 and 1932 Olympics, and turned this into a job in 1933 with ""King of the Jungle"" as Kaspa the Lion Man.  That led to this serial and launched Crabbe on a long career. He is best known for his ""Flash Gordon"" (1936) serial which remains the best serial from the 30s and 40s, and his early TV series ""Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion"" (1955-7)

Lesser made the serial to conform closely to the 1932 film, even using Cheeta the chimp, and only changing the female character's name to Mary from Jane. But he wasn't able to use Weissmuller's yell and instead used the radio version, which is considerably less impactful. In 1933 he combined the chapters into an 85 minute film which he released in the U.K. It was later re-released in a 71 minute version.

In addition to Buster Crabbe and Cheeta, the film includes Jacqueline Wells (later Julie Bishop) as the female interest, Mischa Auer as the High Priest who kidnaps her father, and Edward Woods as Bishop's suitor.

Cute as a button Julie Bishop (1914-2001) was a well known child star in the silent era and later appeared as the sweetheart in B films in the 30s, and better films in the 40s - e.g.,  ""Action in the North Atlantic"" (1943) and ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949).

Long, lanky Mischa Auer (1905-67) was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), one of more than 100+ films he made, often playing a foreigner in films like ""Clive of India"" (1935) and ""Anna Karenina"" (1935). I liked him best as the ballet teacher from ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938) and the Russian-turned-cowboy from ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939).

Edward Woods (1903-1989) was originally slated to play the lead in ""Public Enemy"" (1931), but director William Wyler switched him with James Cagney and the rest was history for Cagney, and a series of supporting roles in B films for Woods. He made only 11 more films after that, this film was his 6th, and his last film was in 1938 (""Shadows Over Shanghai"").

Director Robert Hill (1886-1966) made more than 100 films between 1916 and 1964, including a remake of this film for TV in 1964. He worked on the 1921 ""Adventures of Tarzan"" starring Elmo Lincoln, and worked with Crabbe again in 1938 on the ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" serial.

For a serial that was converted into an 80 minute film, the continuity is pretty good. Of course, careful viewers will spot buffalo and horses in the middle of jungle scenes, and it is sometimes hard to keep track of the villains who appear variously as blacks, Arabs, and Egyptians. But who can go wrong with 15 minutes of watching Olympic champion Buster Crabbe swimming, swinging through the trees, wrestling lions (pretty exciting stuff here) and fighting crocodiles.

1933 was a good year for films. Box office hits were Mae West's  ""I'm no Angel"" and ""She Done Him Wrong"", the star studded ""Dinner at Eight"", Roby Keeler and Dick Powell in ""42nd Street"",  ""King Kong"", and Garbo in ""Queen Christina"". The Oscar winners were ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (Actor), ""Morning Glory"" (Actress) and ""Cavalcade"" (Picture). Other notable films released that year included the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"", Laurel and Hardy's classic ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""The Invisible Man"". Fred  Astaire and Ginger Rogers made their film duo debut in ""Flying Down to Rio"". FWIW - 1933 was the year that Walt Disney referred to the gold statue as an ""Oscar"" when he won it for ""The Three Little Pigs"".

In addition to ""Tarzan the Fearless"", 11 other serials were released in 1933, the most famous of which were ""The Perils of Pauline"" starring Evalyn Knapp and ""The Three Musketeers"" with John Wayne.

All things considered this film is surprisingly watchable. It's not up to the quality of Weissmuller's Tarzan films, but it does have a certain charm to it, and at times you get the feeling you are watching Crabbe's later serial ""Flash Gordon"" with the good blonde girl and the bad dark haired girl, the old professor, the evil villains with elaborate headdresses, etc.

BTW - the version I saw was the 80+ minute version. Picture quality was good, but not great, and sound was good.",1309996800,,5341,4.743257820927724

Alyn Warren (Dr. Brooks),  Edward Woods (Bob Hall),  Philo McCullough (Jeff, villainous safari guide),  Matthew Betz (Nick, villainous safari guide), Mischa Auer (Eltar, High Priest),  Frank Lackteen (Abdul), Symona Boniface (Arab Woman),  George de Normand (Guard), Carlotta Monti (Priestess of Zar),  Darby Jones (Head Bearer),  Al Kikume (Warrior) . . . . . . our story is taken from Burroughs' novel, ""Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar"", as Tarzan must rescue Jacqueline Wells our heroine from native slave traders and keep thieves from stealing the ""pretty pebbles"" that make up the jeweled city of Opar ... the High Priest Mischa Auer is the main villain who will stop at nothing and by whatever means to get the jewels and kill Tarzan in the process ... but what of the bounty hunter Philo McCullough who has placed a price on the Ape Mans head ""Dead or Alive"" ... Buster Crabbe is in great shape and his performance for the times is convincing, even though Johnny Weissmuller was the most popular Tarzan, Crabbe looked the part and even had a better screen presence ... Crabbe's role in a 1933 Tarzan serial, also issued as a full length movie ""Tarzan the Fearless"", launched a successful career in which he starred in over one hundred movies ... this would be the only film in which Crabbe starred as Tarzan ... In the 1933 movie, ""King of the Jungle"" the 1941's ""Jungle Man"", and the 1952 serial, ""King of the Congo"" he played generic ""jungle man"" roles in the Tarzan mode ... Buster's next major role was as ""Flash Gordon"" in the popular ""Flash Gordon"" serial (a role he reprised in two sequels) ... other roles followed ""Buck Rogers"" and ""Billy the Kid"" a B-Western series with his sidekick actor Al St. John as Fuzz Q. Jones.

Special footnote, actor Buster Crabbe graduated from the University of Southern California and won the 400 meter freestyle in which he medaled in the 1932 Olympics, went to work for Paramount in ""King of the Jungle"" (1933), next role was ""Tarzan the Fearless (1933), Crabbe returned to Paramount Pictures was featured in Zane Grey Westerns which were well received, then came the roles that made him a household word ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Buck Rogers"" at Universal Picture Serials (1936-1940), meanwhile PRC Studios was looking for a leading hero ""Billy the Kid"" and ""Billy Carson"" in the 1940's B-Western series and ran its course for six years, later made several televison appearances and appeared in a series ""Captain Gallant and the Foreign Legion"" (1955-1957).....

1076323,2,6305649103,"As is the case with several Tarzan films from the 1930s, ""Tarzan the Fearless"" was originally released as a 12-part serial. The interesting historical footnote is that theater were given the option of showing the first four chapters edited together as a feature film to get kids interested in the serial and apparently many theaters showed the ""film"" without ever airing the rest of the serial (or even the trailer for the next exciting episode). Apparently all that is left is the ""film,"" which explains why ""Tarzan the Fearless"" is a prime candidate for the bottom of the heap of Tarzan movies. Tarzan is played by Buster Crabbe, who won the gold medal in the 400-meter free-style at the 1932 Olympics, one of three formers Olympians to play the Lord of the Jungle that decade.

The story (or the first third of it since the rest of the serial is apparently long gone) begins with Dr. Brooks (E. Allyn Warren), studying ancient tribes in darkest African when he is captured by the people of Zar, the god of the Emerald Fingers. Tarzan aids the doctor's daughter, Mary (Jacqueline Wells) in trying to find and rescue her father, along with everybody else who has fallen captive to Eltar, the High Priest of Zar (Mischa Auer). However, ""Tarzan the Fearless"" pretty much ends before it gets interesting after about 85 minutes, which is a blessing.

Keep in mind that this is a 1933 film, which means pre-code and explains the reason Tarzan's loin cloth is the skimpest you have ever seen (hopefully). Crabbe, whose previous film role was Kaspa the Lion Man in the Tarzan ripoff ""Lord of the Jungle,"" is given little to do and is also in the running for the least articulate Tarzan of all time. So if it was not for purient interests, there would probably be no interest in this particular Tarzan movie at all.",1099440000,2,1808,4.682389937106918

It's Gordon Scott as Tarzan from Tarzan's Greatest Adventure 1959!  What does this say about the people putting out this product--forewarned is forearmed!",999475200,23,316,5.0576923076923075
1076326,5,6305649103,"Buster Crabbe is the sexiest actor ever to play the loin clothed Tarzan. The movie though made in 1933, still remains entertaining 68 years later. This entry was originally made as a serial, but spliced together as a movie as well, so it could pit against Jonny Weismuller who was playing Tarzan for MGM at the time. Buster Crabbe reveals his sexy butt in this movie, no actor since has revealed so much! The movie is very straight forward, and has a quaint sense of innocence to it from an era of movies, that has long since gone. The picture is jumpy in parts, but this is to be expected as the movie is 68 years old. The images are sharp, a consistant and steady black and white throughout. Buster Crabbe gives a compelling performance as Tarzan, he makes the character more believable than any actor that has played him since. The original theatrical trailer is also included. So if you're into Tarzan, buy this, as you won't be disappointed. If your curious to see a vintage hunk reveal just a little more than you thought was allowed in those days, then this is for you. Hail Buster Crabbe!!! We love you!!",998524800,15,1112,4.50990099009901
