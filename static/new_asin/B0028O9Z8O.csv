3872791,4,B0028O9Z8O,"Very well done docu-series. It almost feels as if parts of it were a movie that was recut to turn into a documentary. If that's not the case then bravo for the lavish enactments. The sets and costumes are very well done for something like this. The narration is good and the information is solid. The only part that was a little strange at times was the dubbing work. This was clearly a foreign production and at times the dubbing just seems to stick out like a sore thumb, but it's not enough to take away from the show as a whole. Good viewing for history lovers.",1507939200,2,565,4.289719626168225

8356515,3,B0028O9Z8O,"It was a high production project with far to much left out. Nothing new learned that I didn't already know from history class, and they really could have gone deeper into some of the more thrilling events of his campaign. Very well done, but shallow.",1514937600,,250,4.5777777777777775
8356516,5,B0028O9Z8O,"Great. Incredibly close to the actual written history. Listen carefully and you will learn some deep and subtle things, which don't stand out in the written history, as much as they do in this concise visual history.
I would know, I wrote a book on him...  ;__0/",1514419200,2,262,4.574468085106383
8356517,5,B0028O9Z8O,"The reason I give this documentary 5 Stars is because it is the first documentary on Alexander that captures what is interesting about him. I haven't seen the world of Alexander re-created in a documentary as good as they have here. Oliver Stone's movie has too many distracting ideas portrayed. Regardless of Alexander's preference in woman or not, that is not why I find his story intriguing. This documentary re-creates the images that are intriguing- simple, yet things from the past- like the ancient Greek warriors marching through Bactria, India and the Persian deserts. I like how the ancient cities are portrayed. They don't get too elaborate with the battle scenes, but the overhead images of the Macedonian phalanxes showed how deadly they would be. I also liked the fact that there wasn't a progressive agenda that filled the doc with annoying anti-western POV. I thought Alexander was portrayed slightly ridiculous. You are talking about the world's all-time greatest military strategist and commander who is still studied by generals over 2000 years later. They could of at least given him that much, but they chose to portray him as a pouting high school quarterback star. But I wasn't too upset because in today's politically-correct gone insane world he could have been portrayed by a teenage girl. Regardless, the production style was amazing and I would like to see more documentaries on other areas of history done in a similar way.",1514419200,3,1452,5.054166666666666
8356518,4,B0028O9Z8O,"Alexander the great was no doubt the greatest military leader to ever exist and this series did an excellent job telling his story, although I would have liked it to be longer and more detailed into every part of his history.",1514246400,,225,4.512195121951219
8356519,3,B0028O9Z8O,Entertaining but certainly does not glorify Alexander. A good summation though.,1512000000,,79,6.2727272727272725
8356520,3,B0028O9Z8O,"An o.k. sorta historical drama.  This was entertaining, and had the 'flavor' of a documentary.  There are some blaring inaccuracies, but if you think of this more of a movie and less of a docudrama, you will enjoy it.",1511222400,2,217,4.538461538461538
8356521,4,B0028O9Z8O,"I enjoyed it, even though it felt short and rushed. I think a 10-15 series going way more into detail about his life would have been so much better. The acting, narrating and costumes were well done.",1511136000,,199,4.405405405405405
8356522,1,B0028O9Z8O,Blah blah blah...,1510963200,,17,5.0
8356523,2,B0028O9Z8O,"Oh boy.  If you've studied Alexander the Great and know his history and actions well, the omissions and errors are going to drive you crazy.  If you've not studied him, think of this as ""a mile wide and an inch deep (or less),"" but please keep in mind the second sentence of this review.  Someone should have helped the narrator with how to correctly pronounce just about everything.  There are much more accurate and informative documentaries about Alexander out there.  Skip this one.",1510531200,14,486,4.807228915662651
