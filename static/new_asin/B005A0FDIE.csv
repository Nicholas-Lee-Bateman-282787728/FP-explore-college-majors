8463161,5,B005A0FDIE,I greatly appreciate Arthur Rubinstein. He is in a class of his own when it comes to piano playing. The Israeli Orchestra is very good under the baton of Zubin Mehta. The Chopin Piano Concerto No. 2 is one of my favorite concertos of Chopin and Arthur Rubinstein for sure does it justice in the way he plays it with his fingers gliding up and down the keys. I like his commentary about his life at the end of the DVD very much.,1449964800,,427,4.156626506024097
8463162,5,B005A0FDIE,This b/w production from the BBC is excellent.  Rubinstein plays Chopin as if he were channeling.  The music is simply Compelling.,1405468800,,130,5.142857142857143
8463163,5,B005A0FDIE,"I heard Rubinstein live-- twice-- and even was lucky enough to spend some time socializing with him.  This DVD, while perhaps short in terms of performance time--  more than makes up for it in terms of the overall experience.  This is Rubinstein at his best, well photographed, with excellent sound.  Nowhere else on video have I seen Rubinstein so completely embody the legend: the Chopin of confidence, elegance, inevitability-- totally without fussiness or display.  Absolutely essential in any collection.",1396828800,2,509,5.3924050632911396
8463164,4,B005A0FDIE,The music was superb.  Seeing an agile Rubinstein at the keyboard & a young Mehta with the baton brought back fond memories for this former Angeleno.,1317427200,2,149,4.730769230769231
