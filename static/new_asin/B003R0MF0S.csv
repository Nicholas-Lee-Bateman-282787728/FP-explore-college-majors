4175753,5,B003R0MF0S,"I enjoyed this episode and the way the writers and cast tried to provide a show that would work for a series finale if necessary. It was worth going ahead and purchasing.

Further: the digital delivery system is excellent. I have a BD player that accesses Amazon Video as well as computers to watch on. The quality and speed of delivery for streaming has been excellent the couple of times I watched this show.",1320278400,,410,4.54054054054054
4175754,5,B003R0MF0S,This is one of my favorite shows so as soon as I got this dvd I started watching it and didn't stop till I got to the last episode. I would recommend this title to any CSI fan.,1319846400,,176,3.6578947368421053
4175755,1,B003R0MF0S,"I was a big fan of CSI New York and really looked forward to Season 7 having thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 - 6. They must have changed writers because instead of the interesting, thoughtful crime solving they are getting into ""touch-y feel-y"" drama which is not only annoying but disappointing on many levels. I particularly don't like the writing they've done for the new team member Jo (Sela Ward). She's given to all manner of 1970's style feminism. It's dated and old. The investigative format of the first 6 seasons has also been replaced by Rambo-like action of its lab techs and chief MacT. There's a lot of childish theatrics. I don't understand why they changed the format of the program but it is disappointing to say the least.

As always, the acting is good but unfortunately the actors don't have a good script to follow.  I watched the first 11 episodes of Season 7 and will not watch the remaining 12 or 13.

Needless to say, I will not purchase season 8.",1318982400,7,969,4.589595375722543
4175756,1,B003R0MF0S,"I was absolutely disappointed with Season 7.  I was an avid fan of CSI NY. This series has many flaws.  The most egregious for me was that 3 episodes from previous series are re-hashed, the only edits are StellaB is replaced with JoD, but the story is the same. How boring it is to watch a whodunnit where you already know the answer.  Flummoxed that the producers thought they can take us for a ride like this.  In many stories MacT tries a macho image a la Rambo & goes in with guns blazing.  Not the cool, reflective, intellectual crime solver that I have grown to like.  In fact, in many of the stories in this season, the ""whodunnit"" kind of mystery solving is missing.  This is not the hi-tech, crime solving stories that we are used to from the previous 6 series.  We also have a very artificial attempt to create a ""human"" image for JoD with an adopted daughter - feels totally contrived & does not touch any chords.  A husband & wife team working together - Danny & Lindsay, has the potential to either create sparks or confusion, unfortunately the story provides neither, very tame.  MacT ends the series on a very sombre note, so perhaps it is the end of the CSI NY franchise or MacT????",1317254400,4,1198,4.404545454545454
4175757,5,B003R0MF0S,"I like the shows of all the seasons of CSI:NY better then all the other CSI shows that they have made. They put together a wonderful cast, and it does keep you in your seat wondering what will happen next. I have seasons 1-6 and am waiting to get season 7, and am very glad that it was picked-up for a 8th season; They can't leave people hanging, not knowing what is going to happen next.",1309824000,14,388,4.118421052631579
4175758,5,B003R0MF0S,"""CSI: NY"" carries its fascinating combination of detective and forensic police work into its seventh season in the Big Apple.  Gary Sinese continues to lead a close-knit cast as tough former Marine and current NYPD Detective Mac Taylor. ""CSI: NY"", a spin-off of the original ""CSI"" and ""CSI: Miami"", offers weekly drama built around the solving of some of the unique crimes possible in the rich ethnic and cultural mix of New York City.

An addition to the cast this season is Sela Ward as Mac's new second in command, Detective Jo Danville, a transfer from Washington DC who arrives with Southern grace, good detective skills, and a proprietary interest in Mac Taylor.  Danville's ex-husband, an FBI agent played by David James Elliot, figures in several storylines, as do her two children.

One of the highlights of this season is a three episode arc at the end, which reunits Mac Taylor with his first mentor on the police force, now retired (and well played by a grizzled Peter Fonda).  A case from early in Mac's career comes back to haunt him, for reasons that only his former mentor can explain, if they can live long enough to have the discussion.  The season finale has Mac questioning his tenure with the NYPD after facing death at close range perhaps once too often.  Mac will tackle his last unsolved case, not knowing whether it will be his last as an NYPD detective.

""CSI: NY - The Seventh Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.  As of 17 May, 2011, ""CSI: NY"" had been renewed for an eighth season.",1306368000,24,1516,4.669172932330827

4175763,5,B003R0MF0S,"I've watched CSI NY since the very beginning. I loved the addition of Sela Ward, but I also like Melina Kanakaredes and will miss her in CSI NY. However, Sela is one of my favorite actresses and this show hits the mark for her. She brings a new perspective to the plot lines. Time and again her laid back attitude is right on. Part of what I liked best about her character is the hint of a Southern woman who isn't out to make her mark. However, Jo is very hardcore about doing the right thing and catching the bad guy with solid evidence that will convict them. The writers were great on season 7 and used her talents to enhance the show.",1491177600,,639,4.203252032520325

4175778,2,B003R0MF0S,"This was a very disappointing season of the series, with the most notable disappointment being the completely abrupt, unexpected and anticlimactic departure of Stella Bonasera, who was one of the most captivating characters of the last 6 seasons (heck, they could have made a decent spin-off with her as lead of the crime lab... CSI:Seattle or CSI:Lawton, Oklahoma, whatever.)  Instead she's just abruptly out of the series. I'm thinking there was a salary dispute or something, but what a shame. And her replacement, the Jo Danville character, is just bothersome on a number of levels. For one thing, it feels as if she's trying to hard to be the overly-powerful character that Stella was, without actually proving that status on the team through her investigative work on the field. Instead she just shows up and starts taking command, pestering Adam and engaging in an eerie, at times almost predatory, relationship with Mac.  I'm not sure who Sela Ward is, but she's an actress who's apparently had a lot of surgical work and who doesn't dress appropriately for her age. These kind of things detract from the seriousness of the character. Likewise Sheldon, who was previously such a brilliant and analytical medically-minded character, seemed to be cast as more of a buffoon this season, playing hooky with a new girlfriend, being tested for weed, and with hair growth that seems irregular in most every episode? He was fantastic as the ME and now he's become almost a kind of comic relief.  What happened to the writing with this series?
Season 7 didn't really offer much in terms of writing. It was great seeing Edward James Olmos but, dang, just one episode?  I was hoping he was going to be written in as a long term character. Just one disappointment after another with this series.  Much like CSI:Miami, I think the cast, crew and writers suspected the end was near towards the later seasons and that's starting to be reflected here.  Gary Sinise is still perfect as Mac Taylor, but I feel he's getting a little bit tired with the series, as am I.",1459900800,,2057,4.829545454545454

4175871,5,B003R0MF0S,"CSI: NY is my favorite CSI on TV - The actors are believable. They show the personal sides of their characters and make you relate to what they are going thru. I can't believe the series was cancelled! If you have been watching since the beginning, like I have, you see how they have grown close to each other. They all work great with each other and support each other when needed. I will very much miss this show! That makes purchasing their seasons...all of them...even more important.",1369872000,,488,4.556818181818182

4175897,4,B003R0MF0S,"This seventh season of CSI NY has maintained the general high quality of this TV series.
However, I am not sure that the new casting has improved the series concerning the female co-protagonist
of Gary Sinise.  The casting experts had shown a marked weakness in their original  selection of the previous
female co-protagonist and now they have not excelled in their selection either, I am afraid.  Excellent
casting is esential to the success of a series, as we all know, because a weak co-protagonist, like in this case,
could damage the whole series.  For this reason, I prefer to give a four-star rating to this Seventh Season.",1357862400,2,630,4.859813084112149

4175910,5,B003R0MF0S,"This is about the time a show should be getting repetitive and stale. But not CSI:NY! This season is SO good!!! jo Danville joins the team, and she is super cool. She's a tough former FBI agent, but she is a really sweet colleague and mom. The team only grows stronger, and the stories keep delivering. The overall theme of the season seemed to be how much they could hurt Mac, which made for a very sad, intense story!",1354665600,,419,4.3164556962025316

I have a sneeky suspicion the discs were copied were archived, and the originals were packaged up and sold on Amazon as new.  From now on I will purchase DVD's & Blu Rays the first week of release from Amazon exclusively and not from a second party!

Bomasera) left the series/transfered to New Orleans. And after the final episode, it may be it for Gary Sinise (Mac Taylor).  I do like the addition of Sela Ward as the ex-FBI agent, she brings a new dimension to the team, but the season lacked the punch of the other six.  You might not see Carmine Giovinazzo(Danny Messner) who just got promoted. We will just have to see won't we..",1324684800,9,546,4.505050505050505
