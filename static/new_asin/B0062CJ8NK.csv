8491094,5,B0062CJ8NK,this movie had me at hello!  I don't speak Spanish but I was riveted.  this is how to do a flashback.  This is how to do a story about true love.  This is absolutely the ONLY way to do an action movie!  Gritty and touching.  I never want to live in South America.,1398729600,,263,3.8679245283018866

8491096,5,B0062CJ8NK,"i saw this on cable last week. Wow. It was better then I thought it would be. When it started out in the beginning i wasn't sure about it, but i gave it a chance. It really is a cross between ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""John Q"" and i'd say w/ a lil bit of ""Sin Nombre"" mixed in as well, but not as much violence though. It's all in Spanish, so get ready for subtitles if you don't understand Spanish.

It's not just a love story, it has a couple of big twists at the end. There's more then a few stories going on in this movie to truly understand the end that comes.

It's definitely worth a watch a few times. I think/like it better than ""John Q"".",1348099200,2,645,3.953846153846154
