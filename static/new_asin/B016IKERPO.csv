8736471,5,B016IKERPO,I have had this classic for a while. I finally broke down and bought the limited edition. One of 3000. I am VERY glad I bought it. The only downside is the lack of extras. But just the improvement in picture quality is excellent,1471132800,,228,4.204545454545454

Back in the thirties we became acquainted with the vampire Dracula via Bela Lugosi. Things didn't spark with the vampire craze again until the sixties when Christopher Lee put new blood into the same character in several Hammer films about the famed count. It wasn't until 1970 that a new blood sucker burst on the scene in a low budget film that drew enough fans to warrant a sequel, COUNT YORGA, VAMPIRE.

The movie takes place in present day (1970 that is) Los Angeles where friends of Donna whose mother recently passed away have gathered together to hold a s&eacute;ance conducted by Count Yorga (Robert Quarry), completely unaware of who he really is. Not long after one of the couples are attacked in their van by the Count leaving the young woman a bit drained of blood and with an appetite for eating the pet cat. Looking into the case Dr. Hayes, a family friend, comes to the conclusion that she is suffering from vampirism. The friends make the decision to visit Count Yorga and confront him with this accusation and end his reign of terror. But things never go quite as planned when it comes to angry folks taking on a vampire of any kind.

Thats a rather short summation of the plot here but honestly thats what it boils down to. The thing is it was never the entire story here that made these films work but instead the updating of the vampire creature that made the film stand out from others. While so many went with the old versions of vampire having their exploits take place in castles well hidden in the Carpathian mountains, this one takes place in LA. Yes, he lives in a castle but nothing like those of the old stories.

The victims of Yorgas rampage are modernized as well wearing the latest fashion as opposed to the costume dramas of past vampire films. This is a hip group of people who might not be willing to consider that a vampire is a real creature at first but who soon come to grips with the reality of what is going on. Where villagers knew that their legends were based on fact, these people are far removed from those days and take some convincing.

The modernization of the vampire here predates that of Anne Rices INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE and even that harkened back to vampires of the past for the most part. Audiences who loved horror films were glad for the arrival of this film. While it falls into the category of low budget films every penny is seen on screen with some decent performances here as well as situations that are not nearly as bad as many teen monster films from low budget studios at the time. Instead we have a realistic look at a creature that hadnt been seen before. The success of the film generated a sequel and paved way for the film BLACULA two years later.

Twilight Time once more does an amazing job of presenting a pristine look with this transfer as well as several well-made extras. Those extras include an isolated score track, audio commentary with film historians David Del Valle and Tim Sullivan, a Robert Quarry interview by Rue Morgue magazine, a fangirl radio tribute to Robert Quarry with Tim Sullivan, a still gallery from both MGM archives and Tim Sullivan archives and the original theatrical trailer.

Horror fans, AIP fans, Twilight Time fans and vampire fans will want to make a point of adding this one to their collection. While MGM sold the film in their Midnight Movies series this is the best print you will find of the film. The fact that the name Twilight Time is on it guarantees that.",1456876800,2,3535,4.54874213836478
8736473,4,B016IKERPO,"What a treat to get Yorga a cult vampire film from the seventies on Bluray. This is a rare treat for Vampire film collectors as Quarry who died in 2009 did only 2 Yorga films and his career tumbled in the mid seventies into obscurity. This is the first of the then crop of vampires films that used gothic horror themes and set it in current times. It was more successful than Hammers excursions with C.Lee. Quarry had a lot to do with the success of the films as he played Yorga straight and gave him charm and evil in equal measures.
This was the first one followed by the sequel Return of Count Yorga another treat. Great fun and a must have for serious collectors.
Good extras very informative.",1456876800,,697,4.369230769230769
8736474,5,B016IKERPO,"Way back in 1970 I saw this movie on a double feature with The Oblong Box (w Vincent Price) at our small town theater--and what a treat Count Yorga was! Robert Quarry portrayed Yorga twice: once in this movie and again in Return of Count Yorga (also out now on bluray). He played another vampire named Khorda in a different flick called The Deathmaster. All three movies are very good.

The Count Yorga movies were really groundbreaking back then. This evil count enjoyed killing, taunting, and basically treating humans like cattle. Cattle to be played with, drained of blood and slaughtered, depending on Yorga's mood. He exhibited an air of superiority since he has lived hundreds of years and accumulated much wisdom over that time. There's one great scene where he has a late night conversation with his adversary about whether vampires exist or not. Of course later in the movie, the humans find out that yes vampires do exist, and they are mean, fast and ruthless.

The movie looks fine in bluray with some grain visible but colors are nice. Surprisingly there are more shots slightly out of focus than I remember from seeing in the past. The commentary gives a lot of info about the film and about Robert Quarry who died some years ago. For those who don't know the history on this movie, it was going to be more of an R rated sex romp than a vampire story. Thankfully Quarry and the backers of the production realized they had a good script and went for horror.

Robert Quarry should have been a much bigger star than fate allowed him to be. His portrayal of Yorga is flawless. He's great whether acting as suave, handsome Count Yorga making the ladies swoon or wild-eyed, fangs-bared figure charging his would-be destroyers. There's enough blood and gore to satisfy true horror lovers and plenty of shocks and good dialogue too.

I met Quarry at a horror convention and still have the signed 8x10 of him as Yorga. He enjoyed the true story I told him about the second time I saw Count Yorga (I was about 15 at the time). Here's the story:

In the 1970s a new wave of movies came along that sometimes had an ""anti-hero"" ending. Without giving away too much, what I mean is, sometimes the good guys don't always come out on top, even if the bad guys take a beating. Count Yorga, Vampire falls into that category. After I saw Count Yorga the first time with some friends and was surprised by the freeze frame shock ending, I had to drag my little brother to see it.

He was probably 13 at the time. All I can say is this: have you ever seen any of those 3 Stooges episodes where Moe's hair stands straight up in the air due to fright? Well I am telling you here and now that at the end of Count Yorga, my brother's hair stood on end! I'm not saying the movie will have the same effect today on anyone, since there have been so many more horror and slasher films since 1970 with more gore and shock scenes.

But I saw my brother's hair stand up on end, thanks to Count Yorga, Vampire. Highly recommended. Rest in peace Mr. Quarry, you are missed.",1448582400,,3052,4.468581687612208
8736475,3,B016IKERPO,"Count yorga vampire is on blu-ray for the first time ever courtesy of Twilight time
which is ALL REGIONS by the way
a new HD transfer is given in 1:85:1 ratio
the transfer does look very Good, but not fantastic but still very nice sharp & clear picture,
slightly better than the 2001 dvd version that's for sure
the sound quality sounds similar to the Mono sound from the old DVD version
but slightly boosted to a master audio mix

about the extras, the old MGM DVD just had the original theatrical trailer
well this time, Twilight time have added some new special features
a new Audio commentary by film Historians David Del valle & Tim sullivan
which is informative about the making of the film
and 2 interview featurettes, Audio interviews actually
1st one is MY DINNER WITH YORGA-THE ROBERT QUARRY INTERVIEW
 which is a reading red by Tim sullivan, Tim's interview with Robert Quarry back in 2009 or earlier
David Del valle acts as Robert Quarry
it's an alright interview it goes for 13mins
 i was very disappointed actually i thought MY DINNER WITH YORGA interview
 was an actual interview with Robert Quarry before he passed away back in 2009
but seems that Tim sullivan is reading an interview he did with Robert back in 2009 or earlier
with David del valle pretending to be Robert, pretty stupid if you ask me
the 2nd Audio interview is a Fangirl radio tribute to Robert quarry with Tim sullivan
very similar to the 1st interview but this 2nd interview is longer goes for 45mins
there's also 2 Photo Galleries, very interesting Photo's actually
the 1st Gallery is the MGM archives of poster stills promoting the film Count yorga vampire
the 2nd Gallery is Tim sullivan's archive Photos which is even more interesting
there's Photos of Robert Quarry at a convention somewhere in the U.S.
 answering questions about the film Count yorga vampire and its sequel
the photos were probably taken in 2008 maybe cause Robert Quarry passed away in 2009
plus there' the usual trailer and a isolated score track which i think is pointless listening to
this new blu-ray version of Count yorga is only worth buying if you can get a copy for $30
Screen archives entertainment website are selling them for $30
maybe 3 stars for this new blu-ray based on new HD transfer, as i said looks very Good for a new transfer but not fantastic
plus the Audio mix is Mono sound maybe enhanced little bit
and the 2 interviews are Audio interviews, so you make your own Judgement if its worth buying or not",1445126400,7,2485,4.638636363636364
