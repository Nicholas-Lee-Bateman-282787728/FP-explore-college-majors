8362410,4,B0019SX8D8,"I wavered on four stars for this one and nearly gave it three because the plot and the acting are so bad as to make it almost unwatchable. But with a movie like this, which essentially is just a lot of sex scenes strung together, that doesn't matter much and isn't what the average guy is looking for.

This is from MRG Entertainment, the Playboy TV successor to Mystique Films and Eros Pictures and by now everybody knows of the resulting dip in quality. The production values plummeted, the girls got less attractive, the acting worsened substantially and the films got noticeably less explicit. All around it was a loss for viewers everywhere.

There still are a few of these films though that are worth watching, and this is one of them although you might find yourself nearly laughing at the terrible script, absurd overacting (even in the sex scenes, which are otherwise pretty good) and not-so-good editing that includes a botched line or two and a visible microphone that invades one sex scene like a big fuzzy (unused) dildo.

To summarize, a kooky rich friend to four old college pals invites everybody over for a strange murder-mystery game that ends up ALL TOO REAL!!!

There is no question that the pneumatic and all-natural Felicia Fox steals the show. Totally hot. Adding in Syren makes this an impressively-busty cast. They have a couple of sex scenes apiece.

Beverly Lynne is all over this one; she has three sex scenes. I just never have liked her. She looks like a soccer mom and I wished that she would retire, because apparently she's about 70 and STILL is doing movies like this. But obviously she has fans and if you're one of them, you're definitely going to want this movie during which she was only a little past her prime instead of totally over the hill like today.

I don't normally comment on the male talent in these films because really, who cares...but I'd be remiss not to mention that Matt Wilde really did a great job acting in this otherwise-pathetic movie. Brad Bartram normally does great in these silly little pics but this was well into his soft-core career and he seems to be working too hard here to upstage everybody else.

I settled in with four stars because (with the exception of Lynne) the girls ARE hot, particularly Fox, and you do get to see a lot of them...and the sex scenes are good even though they do get over the top in places. I like the natural audio. The explicitness at least in terms of nudity just isn't there--not like the old Mystique days but anybody who has seen many of these films won't be surprised by that. But the simulated sex is pretty hot, the pinnacle of which is the scene between Syren and Monica Mayhem's maid character.",1371945600,,2701,4.614583333333333
