3167362,5,B0017637JC,"I watched this film streaming on you-tube and desperately would like to buy a copy. It is not only a film that I think is important because it shows how carrying on through adversity can create great things, or provide an example that having a frightening medical prognosis sometimes can not mean the end of the world--even if it does change your life unalterably.  This film is just completely amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch was inspired. There were huge chunks of the film I forgot I was watching an actor and *not* Stephen Hawking. The supporting actors were also very good.

I really wish this was available in Region 1 DVD. I'd buy at least one copy (and maybe an extra for my library) in a heartbeat.) Highly recommended if you want to see the birth of a great mind, how a great man triumphed over adversity, or even to study one exceptionally fine actor.",1328659200,29,860,4.61437908496732

8264942,5,B0017637JC,"Personally, I prefer THIS movie to ""The Theory of Everything"". (Sorry. While I did like The Theory of Everything and Eddie R. as Hawking- there was something about this drama I found superior. Anyone agree?)",1439251200,3,207,4.942857142857143

had to wait 10 tears,",1426636800,,132,4.695652173913044
8264945,5,B0017637JC,Excellent telling of the famous physicist's life and work. I highly recommend this film for its content and it's portrayal.,1401235200,,123,5.2
8264946,5,B0017637JC,"I watched this on utube and loved it. I learned alot about the genius, both the physicist and the actor.",1393286400,,104,4.25
8264947,2,B0017637JC,"This is a good dvd, to bad the price is way to high for anyone to buy, like $149.99 + shipping. What a rip-off.",1369267200,5,111,3.6666666666666665
8264948,5,B0017637JC,"This movie far exceeded my expectations, and has become a new favorite of mine. Personally, I am a devout Christian and therefore do not believe in the 'Big-Bang Theory'(not because ""the Bible tells me so"", but because I have studied the science behind it in contrast to Creation science, etc), but enough about my personal convictions. While I do not agree with Mr. Hawking's theory, I very much enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of a young Hawking deteriorating into the wheelchair-ridden scientist we know today. I liked that they did not ""dumb down"" the many equations and conversations between the scholars, but that they carried on as if the audience was a room full of Physics majors. It was neat seeing how he came up with the theory we know today, even though many of the scenes were purely fictional. It was also good to jump between Hawking and the interview with Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. All-in-all, I loved this film, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a bit more about Stephen Hawking and/or the Big-Bang theory.",1337299200,11,1058,4.850828729281768
