8151107,5,B000JJSDGK,"It was good to see portions of the life of these two icons (in my opinion).  Dick Clark will live forever in our hearts.  Bobby Darin never got the attention that he deserved in his short lifetime.

This DVD was most interesting.  Thanks to those who made it.",1169683200,6,259,4.333333333333333
