8622974,2,B00GGZF7BK,"I have tried about 30 different qigong dvds and I find visual quality of this dvd to be excellent. However, that is the best feature. The controls take a long time to respond when played on a computer. The biggest disappointment is the teaching itself. The instructor does not break down the movements by initially going thru each one slowly, therefore it is a monkey see, monkey do style of teaching which pales in comparison to the way other chi kung teachers demonstrate new movements. This makes it difficult to learn some of the movements. Another disappointment is the rapid speed at which the movements are done. I cannot see how any chi can be cultivated at that pace. This form seems more like a physical exercise than a chi kung form. I wrote to Kevin Fujita suggesting that he watch Terry Dunn or Simon Blow qigong dvds so he can learn how to break down the movements so that they can be learned and at what pace chi kung is supposed to be done at. I have seen videos of Kevin performing kung fu and it is obvious that he has talent, but I am not sure how well he understands chi kung.",1445472000,3,1096,4.377450980392157
8622975,5,B00GGZF7BK,"I had heard that Chi Kung (a form of Tai Chi/Kung Fu) is good for your health and longevity, so I decided to try this DVD out.  This DVD is great!  I love the soundtrack...it makes me feel like I could be at the spa.  I particularly like how there are 3 level options as you progress, which you don't ever get with other workout or yoga DVD's.

1) with visual, music & dialogue instructions
2) with visual & music only, no dialogue instructions
3) and then on your own with just the soundtrack, no visual & dialogue

Out of the numerous workout/yoga type of DVDs I own, I find myself constantly going back to this one.  Definitely my favorite!",1393891200,,643,4.316666666666666
8622976,5,B00GGZF7BK,"I originally know Sifu Kurtis from San Francisco, I now live and work in Singapore. I received ""Martial Health: Chi Kung Fundamentals"" promptly and with no problem, all the way to Singapore. I'm very happy with the product, I use it almost every morning. It really gets me going, helps to energize me; it's an excellent way to start the day! I find Chi Kung circulates the blood as well as air in my body. The exercises relax, warm-up and stimulate my muscles and tissues with every movement. Sifu Kurtis' instructions are gradual, thoughtful and clear. His teachings slowly guide beginners and I believe inspire long-time practitioners too. He really takes the time to guide you through all the twist and turns, deep breathing and applications. The quality of the production is impressive as well. The multiple camera angles and editing serve to display the precise feet and hand placements. The soothing music and location are ideal for a stimulating atmosphere. In addition, the interviews and show of defense applications are extremely informative. They aid in bringing practical uses of the ancient art and discipline of Chi Kung. Lastly, I now have my wife following the video with me in the mornings she, who never was a Chi Kung practitioner or believer before! :)",1391990400,,1272,4.9485981308411215
8622977,5,B00GGZF7BK,"I found that the Chi Kung ( Tai Chi )  fundamental instructions on the DVD that I recently purchased was simple, easy enough to understand and follow along.  I think the beauty about this type of exercise is that all the movements is flowing, smooth and does not seem to require any types of motion that would become a strain.  I especially enjoy the background soundtrack music that creates a somewhat relaxing moment.  I am happy with the purchase I made.",1388880000,,457,4.604938271604938
8622978,5,B00GGZF7BK,"Sifu Fujita is a friend. His kung fu is exquisite, and he takes great care with everything he does, so i was excited to see he had released a chi kung dvd, and i purchased it right away. I had high hopes for the dvd, and he surpassed them in every regard.  It has a beautiful soundtrack that matches the movements perfectly. The chi kung is very good and he moves with a high level of skill, but it is presented in an easy and clear way. I think a beginner could learn by watching, and a more experienced audience will still find much to enjoy.
Chi kung can be considered a kind of chinese yoga, but it is easier for senior citizens and anyone less mobile due to accident or injury, and it is a superior way to improve balance because it is gentler in its approach.
Chi kung is also more naturally complementary for martial artists, as it reinforces and developes important cornerstones common to all movement practices, especially martial arts.
This dvd is a rare gem. I know you will enjoy it as much as i did.
Consider it also as a gift for anyone older or in failing health. Chi kung is gentle enough for anyone while offering much for everyone",1386028800,,1148,4.339534883720931
