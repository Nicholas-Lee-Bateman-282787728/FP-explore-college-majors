3903135,3,B002C3GTLM,Alright lets see first House Rocks! but i wouldn't buy a box with 5 seasons in it then have six come out maybe a year from now. I hate to split up DVD sets more and more shows seems to put together collection sets that are more expensive than each season individually... oh well they are still getting my money and if you want a complete set wait till the series finally for the complete series box set that inevitably will be created.,1251763200,5,435,4.253012048192771
3903156,5,B002C3GTLM,I received the product on a very timely fashion and in great condition. The item purchased was a very reasonable price and I plan on using this person for future orders.,1292371200,,169,4.483870967741935
3903157,3,B002C3GTLM,"Never a Hugh Laurie fan, I was surprised at how brilliant he is in this series.  I'm now a convert. The scripts - apart from occasional exceptions - are slick and smart and the interactions between cast / characters compelling and absorbing.  Why only 3 stars?  The research is diabolical.  Considering that this is a series about a department specialising in diagnostic medicine, I can't understand why the producers do not employ an advisor on the subject.  The mistakes are terrible and would make even a student radiographic technician laugh.  When will the designers put the chest x-ray (opening titles) the right way round (traditionally x-rays are viewed right to left)?  House points at a neck image and diagnoses a cauda equina lesion (the cauda equina is at the bottom of the back).  We're constantly told that MR will pull out plates/screws from bones (NO!!)  House tells staff not to switch on the magnet (the magent is on all the time!) MRIs are performed without body coils. The team often suggest pathologies - and occasionally go on to test for them - which would have already been outuled by pevious examinations.  I could go on and on.  Bearing in mind the amount of cash plowed into House, it is ridculous that no diagnostic advice has been taken on basic proceduress.  Damn it, I'd do it for free!",1287878400,2,1317,4.753303964757709
3903158,5,B002C3GTLM,"If you are a House fan, this collection will be an essential part of your video library.

Through this collection, we can follow the development of the characters and story lines, get the back stories, and enjoy Hugh Laurie and the rest of the talented cast members of this addictive series.  (Pun intended.)

For those with a particular favorite episode, it will be available at your fingertips. There is bonus material that makes the set even more enjoyable.

Be aware that you can get too much of a good thing.  As such, enjoy the luxury of being able to spread out your viewing of the first 5 seasons of this complex and intelligent series.  We watch a few episodes at a time, end are very happy that we have purchased this collection.

Please know that this particular set ends with season 5, where House enters the psychiatric hospital.  The experiences and revelations he has in his inpatient admission are in the Season 6 DVD.

All in all, this collection is well worth the investment.",1286496000,,993,4.660919540229885
3903159,5,B002C3GTLM,"This is our third TV series which we have purchased on DVD, and we are hooked!  No commercials!  No missing scenes when you have to run for a snack!

As for content -
Well, watch an episode or two before you buy the series.  We absolutely love it, but some folks may be put off by some of the more graphic scenes.  We find House to be a fantastic mixture of science, medicine, drama, romance and comedy.  The special effects, particularly when they are portraying the interior of a patients body to show the problem or the effects of a treatment, are absolutely great.  Watch this series, and you will be very entertained - and you will also learn something!",1285804800,,658,4.433333333333334

3903161,5,B002C3GTLM,First off House is a great show as it is. And with this bundle you'll always have the first five season to see how the show go to how it is now,1283731200,,143,3.5
3903162,4,B002C3GTLM,"I know that this is not the seller's fault because it was an unopened package, but the fold out on the House DVDs was cheaply made. I think this set wasn't actually made to watch. I think it was more of a collectors edition. I bought it to watch, so about 100 staples later and the casing is to where the discs no longer fall out. I was afraid that the dics sliding in and out was dangerous to the dics (they slid out so easily that if I turned the case of say season one upside down all the dics would fall out and hit the floor. If not for the plastic baggies they were individually wrapped in, they would be badly damaged.), so I stapled the casing and now they don't slip around. That is my only concern about this set of DVDs. They play great! And if any of you were wondering Get this set from thebookgrove. The shipping is fast, and it is the real deal!!! Oh and don't forget season 6 it come out Aug. 31 2010. All new espisode on Fox ( can't remember if they are on on monday or tuesday.)LOL. Hope this has been informative enough. Peace.

3903164,1,B002C3GTLM,"I ordered the House Series for Fathers Day gift but to my dismal when I was suppose to receive the product I was told I was receiving a full refund.  The company did not have the item in stock as their website inventory stated and at that late date I did not have the time to reorder the product from another company--very disappointing.

Amazon was very good with communicating the situation with me and I received my refund right away.",1278720000,,437,4.45

3903178,5,B002C3GTLM,"A great show and a great big collection of it, nice to have on DVD for scanning thru episodes and catching up on ones missed throughout the seasons broader story lines. It ached to spend the money to purchase it but would ache as bad to sell it back someday, so its a real DVD library keeper! It has so many unusual cases and facts and clever humor throughout that I can imagine watching this over and over.  Can't wait for the next box set of seasons to come out.

3903181,1,B002C3GTLM,This item was damaged-I told the seller but heard nothing. Thumbs down! Content is great on episodes that are undamaged.,1266192000,3,120,5.05
3903182,5,B002C3GTLM,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who LOVES watching House.  He was limited to cable TV for a bit of time and was watching many DVDs.  When he got this set, he watched it within about 2 weeks time!  That's a lot of TV watching.  Price was reasonable, and my husband enjoyed watching all 5 seasons.",1265587200,,310,4.203389830508475
3903183,4,B002C3GTLM,"I purchased the House series as a Christmas gift for someone that absolutley loves the show.  The show itself is great, no problems there.

When we received the package, I noticed right away that instead of getting the nice white box that claimed to store all of the series, we received each season seperate without the white box.  We decided to just deal with it because it's not really about the box, but it was a little frustrating because I thought that was what I was getting!

Also, in a few of the sets, the discs were sliding around because the prongs that hold them in place had broken.

I've decided that I probably won't purchased DVD's through the site anymore because you never know what you are really getting and it could end up damaged in shipping. I'd rather pick it out myself at the store.",1265500800,6,808,4.469387755102041

3903196,4,B002C3GTLM,"I bought my boxed set here on amazon, but now I am worried it may not be legit.
On the packaging there are multiple spelling errors, which may be symptomatic of simple misreads/typos on a ""first production,"" yet they occur rather frequently. Since I have season 3 in front of me, I'll use some examples from that one:
Description for Disc one's ""Informed Consent"" reads ""House and his team fine themselves at odds..."" instead of ""find.""  Disc 3's ""Words and Deeds"" reads ""...in order to acoid jail..."" instead of ""avoid.""

I wouldn't usually be concerned about typos, but when they occur this frequently, and I spent practically the msrp, I would hope that it wasn't bootlegged.
Nonetheless, the show itself is very entertaining, but perhaps I should have waited until season 6 was also released on DVD, thus purchasing a complete series...",1262995200,5,840,4.908450704225352
3903197,2,B002C3GTLM,"I should say that I bought the boxed set for seasons 1-4 and I bought season five separately, but if the producer is the same for this newest box set, you'd be better off buying the set at a store with a generous return policy.

When I got my set, I was thrilled.  Then, as I played through each season, I started to see skipped scenes and freezing and episodes starting in the middle instead of at the beginning.  In two cases, I didn't get to see the resolution of the cases at all.

Because it takes so long to watch all the episodes, by the time I realized there was a problem it was too late to return the set.  I notice that the set I bought is no longer being produced; I assume that the manufactor is simply making seasons 1-5 instead.

To pay $100.00 for defective disks is unconscionable.  I love the show but certainly wouldn't recommend this set to anyone.",1261958400,29,868,4.2560975609756095
3903198,5,B002C3GTLM,"I purchased this item as a gift.  I looked all over the internet for the House Season Series and Amazon had the best price for all 5 Seasons, which is rare to find; most Seasons are 1 to 4 only.  As expected, the quality of the DVDs are excellent and the package is presented in a very professional way.  The person to whom I gave this item was very happy and I look forward to viewing these DVDs with her.",1261958400,3,406,4.05
3903199,3,B002C3GTLM,"I am going to do some research on who exactly sold me my ""Box Set"" because the box set that I bought used on Amazon is a mix and match of what I think is pirated material.

One of the seasons I have has subtitles that can't be turned off another of them has the FOX logo plastered in the bottom right hand side of the screen, needless to say that is not what I payed good money for...

I am new to Amazon so if anyone could point me in the right direction for figuring out who exactly I bought it from, I would be extremely happy because they owe me a ""like new"" copy that they advertised.

3903204,3,B002C3GTLM,"First, House is still in production for at least this current sixth season, so when the series does end you can probably expect a ""Complete Series"" set with extras not in the individual five season sets that are simply being bundled together here.

Second, buying separately is a better deal. Seasons one through four are easily found for around twenty dollars a season and season five for a little more than that if you are willing to shop around.

It is true that the original Season One was on dual sided discs, but season one is being reissued next month on single-sided discs, so you can easily escape that problem. I was burned by the original dual-sided season one set, so I can advise you avoid it.

I obtain my three star rating as follows:
House as a series is thoroughly entertaining. I could watch Dr. Greg House watch paint dry and feel like it was time well spent, so I give the first five seasons 5/5 stars.
This is not a good deal any way you look at it - as a completist or a bargain hunter, so for value I give it 1/5 stars.
Averaging the two scores together I give this set 3/5 stars.",1253923200,65,1103,4.318840579710145

Soooo, unless you just have to have a boxed set (which the 6th season won't fit in), I'd just buy them by themselves. (obviously all at once else shipping makes the savings moot)",1252627200,27,381,4.686567164179104

8362979,5,B002C3GTLM,"I had this item in my cart when it was 90 dollars, but for some reason, they took it out when they changed it to 300 dollars.. Odd... because I for one think it was a great idea to price this item at $270.00. I mean, this collection contains five seasons. each season costs 20.00 when sold separately. That's a combined total of $100.00. Now I know what you're thinking: ""100 is less than 300"", but c'mon people. Do what the damn company is suggesting. Buy this DVD package at 3 times it's retail value! You'd have to be a fool not to. I mean, buying them seperately would waste 20 seconds of your life that you could never get back. AND PLUS! this magnificent little collage comes with a nice little white case for all the seasons that is really pretty and very nice to look at. Especially for an ignorant, overly obsessive House fan/collector. This product has a great subliminal message behind it. DEFY THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR IN TIMES OF A RECESSION. THIS IS THE LAND OF THE FREE! This pitifully ignorant company deserves your hard earned dollars, and what better way to earn them than through manipulation and lies. After all, we are all House fans. We understand the concept of lying and manipulating. And in a way, we're sort of like his patients: Ignorant fools with no common sense whatsoever... or at least we should be while making this purchase just for the sake of ""staying in the spirit"". So, ignore your subconscious. Do something good for someone who is genuinely bad. Buy this DVD collection for three times the appropriate price while you still can.

8362982,1,B002C3GTLM,"I ordered this box set from a retailer and paid up front.  A few days later, I got an email saying that it wasn't available and that the fault was due to bad information from the supplier's order fulfillment team (someone told someone else that the material was available, when it wasn't really on stock).  The order was cancelled, and my money was quickly refunded. I don't have a major complaint on the specific supplier, except in the area of inventory management and business data.

However, I have to wonder where Amazon is in all of this.  I understand the role of Amazon is really more of a marketplace coordinator here, but you would think that a system would be in place to coordinate another supplier, recommend another supplier, or to do SOMETHING to help fulfill this order.
If I were not living overseas I would avoid Amazon altogether on items like this, as it just isn't really worth the hassle at this point.

I really enjoy this series, and the box set was intended to be a gift for my wife.  Looking forward to being able to write an actual review.....once I can find a supplier to send me the set.",1299196800,,1116,4.5
