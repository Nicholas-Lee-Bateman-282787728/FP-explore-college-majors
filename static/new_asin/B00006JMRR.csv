1782209,5,B00006JMRR,"""Back Woods"" has touched a part of our souls previously unknown to us.  We would like to proclaim our unending admiration for the director of this movie.  He may single-handedly revive the movie industry.",1038268800,4,204,4.970588235294118
1782210,4,B00006JMRR,"When Stanley Kubrick released ""The Shinning,"" I was among the critics who asked themselves, ""Why doesn't Nicholson do the whole transvestite thing? That could be funny.""  The conclusion that I came to was that Stanley Kubrick, who had enough inititative to institute the greatest jump cut in film history (""2001""), lacked the ""chutzpah,"" for lack of a better word, that is showcased in Grant Woodhill's masterful cross-dressing horror masterpiece, ""Back Woods.""  For anyone who felt that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an exercise in masturbatory horror sans payoff, ""Back Woods"" pays those blue-balled debts off in dividends.
The film transcends ethnic boundaries with its diverse cast, who hail  from the beatiful rice fields of China to the cobblestone streets of old time France to the shopping mall-ridden streets of suburban Chicago. Utlizing Woodhill's now patented ...-style directing and the ponderous camera tilts up to a vast sky, ""Back Woods"" is a visual feast for the eyes from digital frame to digital frame.  As a director myself, I was impressed with the lavish production values on this film; the gas station set alone must have set the filmmakers back a couple of clams.
As far as the acting, the Davids (Hayes and Brenders, the latter who lights the screen on fire in a film-ending cameo) bring the vivid writing to life. There is not one performance in this film that could be called sub par, including an Oscar-worthy turn by the female lead's nipple, which ironically gets more screentime than most of the unfortunate victims of the serial killer, Luther.
While ""Back Woods"" wasn't graced with a wide theatrical release, it has the power to stand alongside the titans of cinema. Coppola and Brando. Scorsese and De Niro. And now Woodhill and Hayes. While I don't see Joan Rivers reviewing these strapping young men of Hollywood on E!, I see them reigning as the kings of straight-to-video releases for a long time.
(And on a side note, fans of this film would also benefit watching some of my work, including ""Bad Boys"" and the soon-to-be-released remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with the broad from ""7th Heaven.""",1033344000,4,2138,5.014084507042254
7970558,1,B00006JMRR,"How could you not watch a movie with a cover like that! This movie was made on a budget of less than $1000 and it shows! If you think it looks ridiculous, wait until you hear what it's about! A woman, who has been pregnant for 30 years, gives birth, out of her back side, to a 30 year old, 300 pound, retard baby, after which she gets hit by a car. The man-child proceeds to tear her dress off and put it on. He then goes on a murderous rampage, going by the name mangina. He kills, he mutilates, he eats their privates on a gory rampage. This was hysterical, but how this thing ever got national distribution and a sequel is beyond me. As the saying goes, now I've seen everything!",1361491200,,682,4.135338345864661
7970559,1,B00006JMRR,"The movie was your typical DTV disc of crap. I guess if you know the inside jokes of the cast, it makes it funny. For the rest of us, it's awful.

There's a special feature of a play that comes with this movie. There isn't much info on what it is but it looks like either a small high school play or possibly a junior college play. It's filmed many rows from the front, so you get to deal with that. At first I thought something was going to happen and it wasn't just a play but it kept going and going so you knew it was going to be a play. Then I looked at the run time of the play. It's a long play. I had to stop it as I wasn't going to sit through an awful play that the people that made Back Woods somehow thought was good.",1333411200,,729,3.7960526315789473
7970560,3,B00006JMRR,"A lot of people hate on this movie...and I don't blame them.

Yes it's a [literal] bad movie, but honestly, you have to have a certain type of sense of humor to really enjoy it.

As cheesy as it is, I laughed my ASS off... I then showed it to my friends and they laughed their asses of, too.

A part of you may die inside watching it, but at least you'll be amused/entertained.

So, if you are looking for a serious horror movie...don't buy this one.

If you are looking for something to laugh at, or even better, laugh with your friends at, then definitely buy it.

It grows on you...like a tumor of joy!",1320796800,2,605,4.172413793103448
7970561,3,B00006JMRR,"i watched this movie years ago and had to buy it for a friend. It was a cheesy b rated film but we bought it as a gag gift.
seller sent the movie out immediately and the item was as expected...brand new in packaging.",1319241600,,216,3.9318181818181817
7970562,5,B00006JMRR,"I want critics to know that when i see a movie in the horror genre with a ton of bad reviews chances are im gonna love it, i grew up liking everything that got a bad review, like alice cooper, kiss and horror films, i cant wait to see this movie!",1283731200,,246,3.843137254901961
7970563,1,B00006JMRR,"I'm not ashamed to be an aficianado of low-budget, no-budget and generally low-brow video. To me it is true talent to create anything gripping and entertaining from nothing. ""Backwoods"" instead creates NOTHING from nothing. Watching this ""video"" is akin watching the biggest fools you could hope to never meet traipse through the wilderness in a possible state of intoxication screaming at one and another for an hour plus.
The losers who put this together probably worked one another into a destructive and delusional groupthink that the video they were making will be ""so BAD it will be GOOD!"". No, this is so bad it is bad. The video should be burned, the writer/director/producer/actors BANISHED from the industry.",1188518400,4,718,5.145299145299146
7970564,5,B00006JMRR,"I believe this is one of the best B horror movies I've ever seen. But be warned, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE TO WATCH ALONE. Back Woods is a movie best seen with friends ... and perhaps some sort of enhancements. The humor is simple but incredibly funny because you know not one of those idiots are taking themselves all that seriously, so neither should you. There are a couple of generally creepy moments, but it's all in good fun. The whole movie is incredibly quotable and also features a beautiful wrack. So just forget what that other loser said and give it a try.",1159574400,,562,4.3619047619047615
7970565,1,B00006JMRR,"Things you can buy just as cheaply as this awful DVD: a six-pack of beer, a supersize fast food meal, a box of condoms, etc. etc.  My point being that even if you find yourself spending $3 plus postage for this visual atrocity you will still feel like you got ripped off.  The ""filmmakers,"" if you can call them that, should be paying the audience for sitting through this crap.
Don't get me wrong, I love low budget sleaze and horror, some of it shot on video, whatever.  But this was by far the worst thing I've ever seen.  Looks like a bunch of drunk frat guys got their hands on a video camera and filmed a pathetic excuse for a horror film.  If you still need reasons not to watch this, then read on.
First of all, the bad video quality.  The cheapest available digital video camera must have been used, since whenever there's the slightest bit of camera movement the screen breaks up into little ""pixel"" blocks.  But that's a minor complaint when you consider how annoying every person that walks onscreen can be.  The cover describes this as ""dark, demented, and obnoxious.""  I would only agree with the obnoxious, especially David Hayes as a bloated, idiotic Baby Huey type that definitely qualifies as the all-time worst screen portrayal of a maniac killer I have ever seen.  Watching him jump up and down and dance like a drunken toga party reject made me want to smack him in his fat face.
Then you have the terrible attempts at humor, which I won't even get into save the following: there is nothing more annoying than an awful horror film that tries to save itself by referring to established movies in the genre, especially Friday the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.  Within seconds you get references to all the above, delivered in the clumsiest fashion possible by the wretched cast.
Finally there's the crappy gore FX.  Learn how to set up a camera, dude!  I mean, given the low budget we expect some bad FX, but come on!  In the shovel beating scene you can see that the body being beaten is just a stuffed dummy that doesn't even have hands or feet!!  All they had to do was pull in a little closer, problem solved.  But what do I expect at this point, right?  The violence is not shocking.  What is especially painful to witness is the male nudity that constantly invades the film.  There is actually an evil spirit character called ""Mangina"" that is a masked naked man with his privates tucked ""Silence of the Lambs""-style, who is continually shown dancing in slow motion.  The first glimpse of a character that we get in this film is an extreme close-up of a fat guy's naked butt crack, and that pretty much set the tone for the whole release.
If it's dumb shot-on-video horror with cheap laughs that you are seeking, try Mulva: Zombie A** Kicker.  At least that one has some funny dialogue and characters.  Back Woods is the equivalent of taking a huge cinematic dump.",1077235200,,2906,4.558766859344894
7970566,3,B00006JMRR,"This film reminded me of when I bought my first camcorder years ago. I made all kinds of little shorts. I still get a kick out of watching those tapes.  This is a very student film. It's like watching a train wreck. You want to turn away but just can't.
I actually got embarrassed during a few scenes and I watched it alone. The makers of this film make no pretense as to the fact this is a good film. They know it's bad and they run with it.
I admire them for that.
This probably doesn't deserve 3 stars but I gave 'Silo Killer' 2 stars and I'll never watch that movie again!
Will I watch 'Back Woods'again? Yes, probably so but I won't tell anyone. 'Back Woods' is like nothing I've ever seen before and that's probably a good thing.
The copy I got is actually autographed on the cover by the star.
That's funny enough right there.
Here's my advice, instead of buying this movie talk a friend into buying it. After your friend has watched it ask to borrow it and just never return it. I promise your friend will be too embarrassed to ask for it back and you save a few bucks.",1063152000,,1077,4.177884615384615
