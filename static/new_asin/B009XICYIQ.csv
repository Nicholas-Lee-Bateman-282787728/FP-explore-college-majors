5371029,5,B009XICYIQ,The female lead character overcame many obstacles and challenges in a male dominated organization and succeeded! Admire her strength and determination. Should motivate females interested in this field.,1392076800,,201,6.214285714285714
5371030,4,B009XICYIQ,"While there are some similarities to American lone-woman-in-the-military films (and they deserved the awards and accolades), this film really stands up all by itself. Korean women are often portrayed as weak, pitiful, or outrageously shrewish. This woman didn't portray any of those characteristics. While still maintaining an identity as a woman, she faced the men head on and used her brain and tenacity to win trust and if not friendship at least respect. I found it interesting that her superior officers didn't all go against her and attempt to sabotage her. I can only respect a man who allows a woman to prove herself if she is determined to try. Only a few of the men actively treated her badly. Wang was especially offensive with the intimations and accusations that only sleeping with her superiors could possibly explain why they weren't bringing her down for daring to enter a male-only world. (Of course that would probably be explained by the fact that he didn't get any when he wanted to.) The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because of Wang. Some of his behavior was too cartoonish to be taken seriously. All in all it was a good film with a strong cast of characters. There was no lack of shirtless, athletic males either.",1389571200,4,1257,4.744292237442922
5371031,3,B009XICYIQ,"This movie was okay.  It's about how this female officer overcome discrimination from her peers.  It's got a good message, that regardless of your gender as long as you strive for you best you can overcome anything.",1388102400,,215,4.783783783783784
5371032,4,B009XICYIQ,"I enjoyed this one. No GI Jane didn't understand Koren service rank one minute you are called captain the next you are not,",1379808000,,123,4.391304347826087
5371033,4,B009XICYIQ,"This is a remarkable movie. I don't watch too many S. Korean movies. I'm more interested in the dramas. Anyway, the movie centers around a female soldier and her struggles in a male dominant environment. It's not just the respect from her fellow soldiers she wants. She also, wants to regain her father's honor. Unlike some Hollywood movies, this doesn't have the in-your-face-feminists-stance. (I'm female so I can say that) She's just a girl, who like many S. Koreans, work their butts off for what they believe in. For her, it ultimately leads her to readjust her views about her father and her relationship with her military family.",1374105600,,636,4.898148148148148
5371034,3,B009XICYIQ,"Was looking for a slapstick military comedy, this was not it. Doesn't belong in the comedy category. Good story it was fun to watch just not funny.",1369785600,,147,4.481481481481482
5371035,5,B009XICYIQ,I appreciate and respect the other reviewers comments and would like to add that this movie stands on its own for being a terrific movie.  The actors and their performances were awesome.  The story was gripping on many levels.  The Korean movie industry produces true movie art and this movie is one of them...,1369526400,,310,4.703703703703703
5371036,5,B009XICYIQ,"It flows well, so well that you don't notice the subtitles. It's not Goldie, it's not Demi but this movie has much more plot, better character acting all around.  At the end of the movie, you'll know 5-7 new character actors and look for them in other movies realizing just how great a movie this was.",1363910400,5,301,4.375
5371037,5,B009XICYIQ,"Although 'Miss Staff Sergeant' is along the lines of 'Men of Honor' with Cuba Gooding, Jr., the addition of a woman in the elite forces changes the dynamic even more.  Lee Yu-mi epitomizes honor, duty and loyalty to country, but what will it take for the elite forces to recognize her ability both as an elite special forces member and team leader?  What is driving her?  Will she have enough heart to carry through all of the challenges before her?

I definitely recommend you watch this film and find out.",1360972800,7,507,4.6
5371038,4,B009XICYIQ,This film features a strong female lead who didn't have to become prettier or fall in love to succeed. The usual Korean themes of honor and hierarchy are present and are dealt with both comedically and dramatically. Overall an enjoyable movie.,1436745600,,243,4.951219512195122
5371039,5,B009XICYIQ,"Really good movie, very inspiring. I loved how Sergeant Lee never gave up and always stood up for herself. Amazing development of the true bond between soldiers. Will bring back memories.",1421971200,,187,5.064516129032258
5371040,1,B009XICYIQ,The Asian version of Gi Jane with Demi Moore,1420588800,,44,4.0
5371041,2,B009XICYIQ,"Miss Staff Sergeant was useless when it came to actual battle.  Because of her, her superior was shot, granted it was the initial shot and not what killed him but still... useless.

Someone compared this to GI Jane... GI JANE was WAY better, WAY tougher, oh and actually useful aka helps to save the day.",1414800000,,304,4.509090909090909
5371042,4,B009XICYIQ,"A bit Stripes, a bit Meatballs, a bit GI Jane, with some anime-like moments for good measure. And yet, it's a movie in a class by itself. (Note: while there are some funny moments, contrary to Amazon's genre-lumping I would not classify the movie as an actual comedy).

Lee Yoo-mi is a driven young sergeant in the South Korean Marines, tapped as a recruit for ""Force Recon"" (after initially being refused a slot when she volunteered) in a PR move to respond to media criticism that it has no women. Naturally, she faces great sexism and jealousy, most of all from Sergeant Wang who repeatedly undermines her attempt to prove herself. His sabotage is never honorable, but eventually his pattern of abuse leads to disaster.

Lee, Wang, and their First Sergeant Kang are well-developed and well-acted characters. Supporting roles are equally effective, and the movie is entertaining and engaging throughout.

I think it could have been even better, had it stuck to a more uniform theme. But then, my Hollywood-informed tastes could just be speaking out of turn there. I've seen a number of Korean films that mix and match, and in many cases successfully. So who am I to question it here?

Just be prepared to do some genre-jumping along the way.",1409702400,,1243,4.821596244131455
5371043,5,B009XICYIQ,love it funny movie,1406419200,,19,4.0
5371044,3,B009XICYIQ,"Was not nearly as serious a portrayal of women in the military as I was expecting.  It wasn't a bad movie over all but some moments were so unrealistic that it just killed it a little. Like talking back to your superiors, speaking out of turn or when she would look totally scared....Just unrealistic.
Liked the movie for what it was but wasn't what I was expecting.",1403568000,,366,4.462686567164179
5371045,3,B009XICYIQ,Ah-Lee needs more make up but beside that movie wasn't so bad. Not the best but what can you expect,1398038400,,99,4.0
5371046,4,B009XICYIQ,"I thought this was going to be your typical ""lone woman in the military"" movie farce.  You know:  the little lady humanizes those rough soldiers and wins their hearts and loyalty.  But there was a plot line I didn't expect (too much) and I found myself really enjoying this because it didn't dish up some of the all-too-typical ""woman in a man's world"" tropes I've come to expect.  Give yourself a treat and watch this one.",1393891200,,423,4.526315789473684
5371047,5,B009XICYIQ,"Loved it, very comical, in my opinion it doesn't need added or subtracted. I truely enjoyed it. I recommend it.",1392595200,,111,4.6

8545013,5,B009XICYIQ,"Fiction, nevertheless, If You don't like the idea of women in elite Military Squads. This movie might help you change your mind. After all, opinions are generally informed by fact along with fictional thinking processes. Great movie and acting!",1453852800,,244,5.282051282051282
8545014,5,B009XICYIQ,"The actress is great and the story is great.  Highly recommended.

Not gory bloody like American movies. I'd rate it PG-13.

Other great action stories are:
- daisy (Korean movie)
- The Grand Heist
- Secret Reunion (Korean movie)",1442707200,,229,4.82051282051282
8545015,5,B009XICYIQ,Reminded me of GI Jane but less gritty. All a bit unrealistic but a very pleasant watch.,1441843200,,88,4.235294117647059
8545016,5,B009XICYIQ,"It was another female soldier in the male dominated group; however, the setting in South Korea dealing with North Korea made fun to watch.
Good laugh!",1438214400,,150,4.8076923076923075
