195572,1,1574922807,"The director and script destroy both the insightful plot and character development of Hardy's brilliant novel. Where Hardy describes Wildeve as ""one in whom women find nothing of which to object and in whom men find nothing to admire,"" Clive Owen's intensity and over-acting destroy the character and characteristic aloofness of Hardy's ambivalent and ordinary Wildeve. And compared to Hardy's complex and nuanced Eustacia, the Eustacia of the movie is revoltingly unprincipled and unsympathetic. It is difficult to imagine that Gold has any understanding of Thomas Hardy or the Late Victorians. Gold would have done better to direct a Harlequin Romance. The only things this film has in common with the novel are its title, character names, and location.",1129420800,8,755,5.352941176470588

It's not all Stevenson's fault. Catherine Z-J, as Eustacia Vye, is dreadful as well, as is most of the dialogue. The film can't even make the Wessex landscape look pretty.

195574,4,1574922807,"This early vehicle for a young Catherine Zeta-Jones does justice to the complex Hardy novel despite the constraints of the television movie format.  'La Zeta' is perfectly cast as Eustacia Vye, a mysterious beauty with 'black hair and pagan eyes' who captivates the young men of the vicinity while the older country people regard her with suspicion as a witch who is not to be trusted.  Eustacia has a reputation as a loose woman in the neighborhood--she dallies with another woman's fiance out of sheer boredom, even though she is tired of him.  When dashing Clym Yeobright returns home after many years abroad in Paris, Eustacia sets her cap for him, with tragic results.
Fans who have followed Zeta-Jones' high-profile career in movies such as 'Entrapment', 'Traffic' & 'Chicago' will be interested to see her here, long before Michael Douglas and Oscar came calling, in her debut role outside of her native UK.  She displays all the beauty and cool self-possession of the star she would later become.  She's had her teeth capped since, and been otherwise glammed up, Hollywood-style, but all the fundamentals are there.  The setting is breathtaking (shot on location in Northern England), and the simple yet vivid costumes Eustacia wears add to her characterization.  Eustacia/Catherine is dressed simply but vividly in tones of scarlet, yellow and turquoise blue, setting her in sharp relief to the browns and grays of the landscape, and the dull clothes worn by the other characters.
The entire cast does a superb job, but this is really Zeta-Jones' show.  Whether you're a Zeta fan, or a student of Thomas Hardy, this production should be on your shelf.",1070064000,81,1660,5.010909090909091

I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to watch this film.  But Hallmark is a name the presents the best, quality films.  Now, there is a reason to give this film a second look.  Clive Owen who plays ""Damon Wildeve"" could have become the next James Bond 007 in 2006.  He was on the list of contenders, but sources say he turned down the role and so Barbara Broccoli chose the very physical Daniel Craig instead.  The other reason is the female lead is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at the time) and became an Academy Award winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003.  Joan Plowright as ""Mrs. Yeobright"" is also in this film.  I like the opening line in the film: ""Deliver my heart from this fearful, lonely place.

195600,5,1574922807,"The countryside is the star of this movie!  Paris couldn't hold a candle to it.

But a drawback of this awesome earthly place in the movie is that the people who live there seem to be awfully superstitious.  There's an exceedingly beautiful young woman among them they think to be a witch.  The enlightened viewer from the perspective of our enlightened modern age begins pretty soon to wonder if the ""superstitious"" people may be right.

This is one of those stories in which the author has deliberately constructed a few significant character names.  ""Eustacia"" means, literally, ""high-standing""--and the movie maker has echoed that meaning by creating scenes in which Eustacia is depicted standing dramatically, like a classical goddess, on high places.  (And Clym, who loves to read, says that she belongs in the (classical name?) Room of the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris.)  Eustacia seems to rule over the men who worship her.  In certain conversations, she evinces a high and haughty behavior.  And, like a ""witch,"" she uses her great personal drawing power for selfish ends.

Damon Wildeve's name can be translated perhaps as ""Daemon of a Wild Eve-ning""...

Another significant name is that of ""Yeobright,"" which is synonymous with the word ""eyebright.""  Clym Yeobright sees Eustacia first--and last--in a vision.  He apparently has the gift of ""second sight,"" but his name which focuses on concepts relating to sight and insight is somewhat ironic.  He is blind to the seeming--or is it real?--duplicity of Eustacia's character.  His mother, Mrs. Yeobright, has great insight and wisdom about the love relationships between men and women.

Diggory Venn, who is capable of sacrificial love, seems to be a kind of Christ figure, especially in the way he is visually depicted by the movie director at the end of the story.  The red, the ""reddle,"" that covers him because of his work with sheep dye is washed off and, in the process, his face is reminiscent of the ""Ecce Homo,"" the bloody-face of Christ during the Crucifixion, and this occurs during a scene where he risks his life for the sake, indirectly, of his beloved's happiness.  This is also the point when his time of sacrifice will be over.  I don't see that the spelling of his name holds any hidden meaning, but possibly a linguist could discover that it does.

(After reading a summary of the book, I've learned that Diggory's red coloring is meant to suggest a DEMONIC figure.  He is referred to in the book as mephistophelean.  So, there's a laugh on me.  Don't pay any attention to my fanciful interpretation of the film's symbolism! --It's been a long time since I read the book and I never studied it in literature classes.)

Thomas Hardy was NOT an orthodox professing Christian, yet, at the end of the movie-story, Clym is shown teaching on a hillside in a scene that may very well remind the viewer of Christ doing the same.  Clym, the seer of Beauty in this scene, states that he does not speak as the representative of a specific creed but, rather, in behalf of a doctrine that is for the enlightenment of all good people.  This defining moment probably represents the mind and heart of Hardy.

At a symbolic level of interpretation--for people who like to speculate about such things that authors do sometimes write into their literature--Eustacia OF THE FILM could be seen (because of the teaching scene on the hillside), to stand for a ""Muse,"" or, more likely, for just ""Beauty.""  (Clym calls her ""MY Beauty.""  I may be stretching things to suggest such an interpretation.  Am just not familiar enough with the novel to say for sure.)

This is a visually GORGEOUS movie. It's the best Hallmark Hall of Fame film I've ever seen.  Because of the visual beauty of it, I think it's a great work of film ART.

I especially appreciated the character created by the woman who played Mother Yeobright; I think the actress's name is Joan Plowright.

I hope this review won't create preconceptions that spoil anybody's viewing this film with a fresh eye.  I think it's best when a film can be an  effective ""personal"" experience; then later find out if you agree or disagree with other viewers experience of it.",1378598400,2,4184,4.842253521126761

195602,5,1574922807,"I stumbled on this DVD at my local library and was hooked from the first.  This is a lush and intelligent adapation of Hardy's classic, with wonderful actors, absolutely stunning scenery, and a fabulous, haunting score by Carl Davis.

The protagonist, Eustacia Vye, is rather Scarlett O'Hara-esque: willful, restless, and reckless, she uses her looks and charm to manipulate those around her.  Catherine Zeta-Jones brings necessary vulnerability, as well as passion, to the role, and she has both the cool confidence and smoldering beauty to make it inevitable that every man she meets is bewitched by her.

Several of Britain's finest ""tried and trues"" make up the supporting cast: Joan Plowright as a loving and leery mother, Claire Skinner as her tenderhearted niece, and Steven Mackintosh--in a radical departure from his uber-evil character ""The Street"" from ""Prime Suspect""--is the wise and long-suffering Diggory Venn. Celia Imrie appears as a superstitious neighbor, and a bearded Cive Owen oozes heat and a hungry tigerishness as Damon Wildeve, Eustacia's frustrated suitor.

Ray Stevenson doesn't fare as well in the role of Clym Yeobright, the idealistic hero who comes back to his native village.  Stevenson has become an extraordinary actor, but he is rather meh here.  He's by no means awful, but is a bit one-dimensional and colorless compared to the other vivid characters.  It doesn't help that he's saddled with the only weak dialogue in the film.  I'm not sure there's anyone who could convincingly say some of his lines.

Overall, though, this is a first-rate and rewarding production. Unusual for TV historical dramas of its time, it offers an authentic look at rural life in the mid-1800's--I loved the details of the farmers painting the sheep with reddle, and the accurate costuming, and all the folk songs sung at various events.  It really is like being transported to Hardy's world--except, happily, we don't have to stay there.",1361145600,6,1955,5.174603174603175
195603,3,1574922807,I was looking for a certain Hallmark movie but couldn't remember the name of it.  Ordered this one and it's not the one I was wanting.  It's not a very exciting movie.,1331769600,,167,4.1875
195604,5,1574922807,"The story opens in southwestern England, in the year 1842.  Clym Yeobright, a successful businessman, has just returned to his beloved heath after some years in Paris.  He meets beautiful Eustacia Vye, the local vixen and tease, believed by many to be a witch, so powerful is her hold over men.  Eustacia dreams of escaping the dull moor and sees in Clym a way to finally make it to the bright lights of Paris.  Clym, however, wants to live out his days as a humble schoolmaster on the heath with his beloved Eustacia.

It's no wonder Thomas Hardy's novel is a classic and this TV-movie does it justice.  The acting is uniformly excellent, the location is, in turns, bleak and wonderful, the sorrowful mood is enhanced by a plaintiff folk score, and the literate script stays close to the book.  The hypnotically beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones captures Eustacia's willfulness and pride and is perfect in the role.  Clive Owen plays Damon Wildeve, a local man who lusts after the elusive Eustacia.  He's very good, as is Ray Stevenson, the 'native' blinded by Eustacia's charms.

195609,4,1574922807,"The first time I saw this film, I was very disappointed.  It was the first rendition of a Thomas Hardy novel I had seen; and I expected a great deal more than the film delivered.  ""The Return of the Native"" is my favorite Hardy novel, though Clym Yeobright, the main character, is not my favorite Hardy character.  In fact, very few of Hardy's characters - especially his male characters - are truly admirable.  But then, Hardy is more an anti-Victorian author in that he is attempting to depict real people, not larger-than-life cardboard heroes and heroines.  It goes without saying, of course, than Clym's eventual blindness simply mirrors his blindness to those around him - his ""tragic flaw.""  Even so, I found Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Clym convincing in that Stevenson seemed to personify Clym's obtuseness.  I did not, however, care for Catherine Zeta-Jones' Eustacia Vye.  It wasn't her performance, which was nuanced and accurately captured Eustacia's character.  Somehow, she just didn't look the part - though I have to say, it was Eustacia as I envisioned her reading the novel, not necessarily Eustacia as Hardy intended her to look; and certainly not Eustacia as others might visualize her.  It's just that Eustacia is such a powerful presence in the novel that it's difficult to imagine someone as innocently beautiful as Catherine Zeta-Jones evoking so much emotional reaction in others. There was an Audrey Hepburn kind of almost childlike innocence about her when there ought to have been more of a Merle Oberon (a la ""Wuthering Heights"") coldness.  I can't picture anyone not liking Catherine Zeta-Jones' Eustacia Vye.

At any rate, though I still found Catherine Zeta-Jones too innocent-looking for Eustacia Vye, when I watched the film a second time, I loved it.  The reason is simply that I had no expectations of liking it, so there was no possibility of disappointment.  Consequently, everything beautiful about the film came through clearly this time; and everything that might be ""wrong"" about the film completely vanished.  Once again proving that one's perspective has more to do with their enjoyment of a film than anything else.",1250035200,3,2162,5.084985835694051
195610,3,1574922807,"There is such rich material in Hardy that it's hard to go too wrong, and this version is passable enough.  Some notes:

1.  Everyone's complaining about the cinematography.  The problem is simple:  the thing was shot on a video camera, and evidently not a very good one. Presumably this series was meant for British television only.  In any event, it's hard to get past this, even well into the film.

2.  Catherine Zeta-Jones has long had a reputation as an actress with a haughty and unpleasant personality, and I daresay you can get a whiff of that here.

3.  The movie is only about an hour and 45 minutes, so while it follows the novel closely, it only follows the major lines.  For example, in the book, the part where Clem decides to be furze-cutter seems to go on and on, but in the movie, it's like he's in his back lawn doing some yard work for only a day.

4.  No subtitles!  Grrrrr!",1247875200,,894,4.371951219512195

195612,4,1574922807,"I caught the first half hour of this when it originally aired on CBS in 1994, but as I was a teenager I did not know of Thomas Hardy's work, nor did I recognize Catherine Zeta-Jones or Clive Owen as they were both unknown in North America at the time. I have since taken a liking to watching period films and reading the classic novels upon which they are based. I have read the novel of The Return of the Native several times; it is one of my favorite Hardy novels, but I couldn't help but notice some similarities to Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, similarities that are evident in the film as well. Wind-swept moors, a headstrong, misguided heroine who marries a kind-hearted but dull gentleman for opportunity and possibility of society acceptance yet she maintains her strong connection to the brooding, roguish man who is tormented by the spell she casts. Spell, of course, used as a figure of speech, although raven-haired Eustacia Vye (Zeta-Jones) is suspected to be a witch  and shunned by the locals of Egdon Heath, since her effect on men seems to have some kind of bewitching quality in their eyes. Even though Damon Wildeve (Owen) is pledged to marry the fair Thomasin Yeobright (Claire Skinner), he cannot seem to shake his feelings for Eustacia, who keeps drawing him to her with her bonfires and her indecision to leave England with him. As much as she wants to escape from Egdon, she feels that somehow Wildeve is beneath her, so when Thomasin's cousin Clym (Ray Stevenson) returns from Paris, she immediately sets her sights on him and leaves Damon in the dust. He, in turn, marries Thomasin almost out of spite, hoping to hurt Eustacia, but she only pushes forward with her plan to win Clym's heart, wed him and hoping that he will take her away from the heath she despises so much. However, with Hardy, things rarely the work out the way his characters hope - Clym wants to stay in Wessex, to open a school and live simply, which only brings his wife to despair and boredom. She begins to wonder if she made a mistake, and re-encountering her former lover only cements her confusion. She is somewhat torn, and this ultimately brings on her downfall as well as Damon's. Other notable portrayals are Steven MackIntosh as reddleman Diggory Venn, who unselfishly loves Thomasin and will do anything to see her happy; his character is both honorable and down-to-earth yet possesses a kind of unworldly knowledge about what he sees around him. And the ever reliable Joan Plowright as Clym's mother turns in yet another wonderful performance. Of course, there are liberties taken (cause of death of Mrs. Yeobright is altered, omission of Damon and Thomasin's child, inclusion of more of the novel's text would have been good at the climax), but overall, for the running time, Hallmark did a commendable job with this presentation. The characters of Eustacia, Wildeve, Diggory and even Thomasin have always held more interest for me than Clym, who in my opinion was never a very compelling character to begin with, sort of like Edgar Linton. Stevenson, also a virtual unknown at the time, does well with his pretty much thankless role - I never really understood what Eustacia saw in him other than her plans for escape and maybe his idealism, but Damon was a far better match for her. With Clym, she sees what she wants to see, whereas with Damon the reality is something that she doesn't know if she wants to see (there has to be some symbolism of Clym losing his sight). Of course, Eustacia and Damon are the most tragic, and are doomed, not only because they are both outsiders and their relationship to each other (which would be considered scandalous in Victorian England), but their desire to escape is only achieved in death. One of the complaints I have about this production is how there was none of the novel's dialogue when Eustacia takes her fatal plunge and Wildeve's ill-fated attempt to rescue her included.

Filmed in Exmoor National Park (rather than in Dorset), the location does make the setting seem more rugged and wild, the music is very emotional and romantic, the cinematography very lush and pretty, Zeta-Jones is costumed more colorfully than the other women, no doubt to make to make her more distinctive (but her beauty does that alone). Very good supporting cast also. And I have to say, I cannot picture anyone else but Catherine and Clive in the roles, even when I read the novel. It's worth seeing for them and the landscape alone!",1234051200,4,4478,4.7471116816431325
195613,4,1574922807,"This is one of the two most faithful and four most enjoyable adaptations of a Thomas Hardy novel. The main reason this Return of the Native is so good is because the filmmakers do not overtly present Eustacia as a black witch. Yes, she has dark hair and eyes, but her manner is usually that of an ordinary woman. I love subtlety in a film, and there is too little of that nowadays. Even if they make Eustacia more obviously responsible for her mother-in-law's death (instead of making her bitten by a snake on a hot summer day, they just have her witch of a daughter-in-law stare at her through the window), she never wears black and has a rather nice voice. This film, for a good while, leaves open the possibility that Eustacia is an ordinary person.

Also contributing to the film's success is the fact that any changes, additions, and omissions are not only minor, they are explained. It doesn't really matter if Susan burns an effigy doll of Eustacia while saying the Lord's prayer backwards (as in the book), or if she burns the latter's handkerchief (as in the film). The point is that something representing Eustacia gets burned. The eliminated gambling scene was here made unnecessary, and the image of Eustacia's probably purified ghost in the last scene makes for a nicer ending.

This is definitely one of the most successful translations of Thomas Hardy to the screen.",1231977600,,1381,4.702479338842975
195614,4,1574922807,What is true love based on .. a dream of something better or a matter of the heart?  ... and what would you choose? Good movie to make you realize the choices that we make will make or break our lives.,1226793600,,201,3.902439024390244
195615,1,1574922807,"very disappointed in this production, though it had two of my favorite actresses (joan plowright and celia imrie). the remainder of the cast was very sub-standard, it seemed very low budget and it also looked like catherine zeta-jones wears dentures. sorry, but this was very off-putting and added to my disatisfaction. it in no way captured the haunting writing of thomas hardy.",1221004800,,379,5.129032258064516
195616,1,1574922807,"A script that even an all-star cast couldn't salvage...
Thomas Hardy being a favorite author, I believe that this masterpiece of a classic deserved so much better than this poorly-acted and presented piece that resembled nothing more than a day-time soap opera.

Nothing more than eye candy (the beautiful landscape coupled with Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta-Zones as a striking pair), the adaptation was mediocre at best, and quite honestly painful to watch in some scenes. Any hope of improvement as the film continued was abandoned as the final credits rolled.

Do yourself a favor and give ""Return of the Native"" a miss. Better yet, check out more faithful and worthy Hardy adaptations by the peerless BBC, such as ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"", ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"", and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" (a particular favorite) - all amazing films that I can say enough about.",1217376000,9,882,5.034246575342466
195617,2,1574922807,"I admit the only reason I got this was because it was inexpensive and I am a fan of Ray Stevenson from HBO's ""ROME"" as well as Clive Owen and my husband likes Catherine Zeta-Jones. It's the equivalent of a romance novel: light and forgettable but a guilty pleasure nonetheless.",1175644800,,277,4.56
195618,4,1574922807,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I really liked this movie.  It was a fascinating psychological study whether or not it was faithful to the book.  Really, if you have read any of Thomas Hardy's books, you know that it would be impossible to turn any of them - even short ones like Jude the Obscure - into a movie shorter than 6 hours without having to sacrifice something! And who could stand that much suffering???

I admit that I'm particular to Catherine Zeta-Jones as she looks a lot like one of my daughters, and I think she did a fine job in this movie silently conveying inner passion and frustrated dreams. She is hypnotic and heartbreaking all at the same time.

Admittedly, Ray Stevenson was rather light and played his part like a kid playing at being an actor, but he was pretty much ignorable next to Catherine and Joan Plowright as his mother, and Steven Mackintosh as Diggory. In fact, Diggory comes across as the wisest and most stable person in the story.

In spite of the fact that it was made for TV, it was well-done and the scenery was beautiful. I've watched it twice with my children and used it as a jumping off point to discuss life and they enjoyed the movie and the discussion after!",1175212800,20,1207,4.493150684931507
195619,4,1574922807,"This is one of my favorite Hardy novels. It introduced me to Clive Owen and pre-Hollywood Catherine Z Jones (she even has bushy eyebrows! also, I thought her voice sounded overly dramatic at times).

It's sad that the people of the town disliked Eustacia, thought her a witch. However, it makes sense that they would think differently of her, as she's more attractive than anyone else in the area and acts as if she's superior. And definitely selfish. Still, that character is one of the most fascinating heroines (or anti-heroines, perhaps).

Lovely drowning scene.",1155686400,2,566,5.01063829787234
195620,5,1574922807,"Every English major learns never to compare a book to a movie. They are not the same vehicle. If you love period movies, this made for TV version is thoroughly engaging and compelling. Catherine Zeta Jones's performance is complex and astonishingly bewitching. She was an extraordinarily talented actress for such a young age. The supporting actors are all terrific,especially Clyve's mother. The cinematography of the moors is errie and mysterious,mirroring the the feeling of entrapment and isolation that Eustacia feels in her soul. Eustacia's plight-which choice to make-is one which women struggle with and can identify with today. The plot is a tragedy to be certain,yet keeps one wondering how our own choices in life have affected our life's course.....would it have been differing IF??I would not have missed watching this movie am thrilled to have it in my collection. We watch it over and over again. Better than most period movies.",1150329600,26,943,5.2105263157894735
