8179762,2,B000NO23V2,This movie is slow paced which I do not think is a bad thing in and of itself. Sometimes a slow pacing let's the tension build or gives time to develop characters. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do either of those things particularly well. Character development it actually pretty bad. we don't really learn anything about anyone so it ends up the seeming like the characters are just going through the motions with no reasons. The Entire premise of the movie is a contract killer wanting out... but there is no indication given that she wants out of the business until about 30 minutes in. Even more unfortunately the story line actually stalls completely for about 15 minutes about half way through. I will admit to not being able to finish watching this one. I made to about an hour in and even having invested that time I just didn't care how the story ended. As others have stated it's a story that has been used before so you won't see anything new (at least for the first hour). The acting is good though and there's no glaring technical problems with the movie. If you have a thing for hitman movies or want to see non porn actors speaking German you might enjoy this movie.,1319760000,,1184,4.537383177570093
8179763,5,B000NO23V2,"I got this because I wanted a cheap movie for learning German. The plot is quite predictable: a girl is an assassin that wants out of the business, but there are some twists and the approach to the psychology of the girl is interesting. For learning German phrases that you would use as a tourist, this is an excellent film. There are scenes at a hotel, a bar, at an Imbiss (food stand), and in a restaurant. The actors are all easy to understand - one guy is a Russian and has an accent but speaks clearly. It is pretty intense, and not for the prudish. The movie opens with a scene of her pretending to be a prostitute, and there are some intense sex scenes (with little nudity, though). I wouldn't let my kids watch it because of the adult themes, even though the violence is about at the level of an action TV show like 24.",1306713600,,827,4.2405063291139244
8179764,5,B000NO23V2,"I just finished watching this film and I thought it was fantastic and highly under rated by the two previous reviewers. The film is not glamorous and is not a stripped down version of La Femme Nikita. No big action scenes, no Hollywood shootouts in a hotel kitchen, no high tech staff of hundreds. Instead it offers an unflinching, uncompromising,look at the life of a contract killer. It is a desperately lonely life with no hope of happiness or redemption. Lea Mornar gives us an incredible performance of that killer.",1289088000,10,520,4.788888888888889
8179765,3,B000NO23V2,"This review is for the amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a decent take on
the La Femme Nikita theme. Lea Mornar is a contract killer who is weary of the
game and wants out. Her much older mentor/lover does not want to give her up.
This film moves fairly slow with not much action but the last ten minutes are
very good. Lea Mornar is very good as the female assassin. This theme has been
played out in several other movies with much better results but this film is well
worth the VOD rental price. The VOD rental has English subtitles.",1288396800,,541,4.211538461538462
8179766,3,B000NO23V2,"So i would like to first say that i picked up this title at random on amazon marketplace (for about $3 plus shipping) so it's not like i regret the purchase. I'm a student of German and love film (i own over 820 DVDs) so i figured i'd give this one a shot. It's not a bad little film, although it seemed short and as if there was a lot of build up for a greater finale than there actually was.
Essentially, Anna is a hit-woman who is looking to get out of the game while trying to avoid her boss and drawing in a hotel clerk to her mess. Acting was good, violence (as is the territory of these films) was actually pretty good considering i got the impression of low-budget filmmaking. It is pretty cookie-cutter as fas as the ""Hitman wants out and has to do last job while bringing innocents into the ordeal"" genre goes.
I kept waiting for something bigger to happen to the characters as Anna asks questions like ""Who is on the hit list?"" and ""Who is hiring us?"" (or something to the effect).
Bottom line: If you can get it for cheap (like i did) than it's worth getting or worth a rent (if you can find it). Otherwise, i do still recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita-Special-Edition/dp/B00008ZZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita (Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leon-The-Professional-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0006GVJEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Layer-Cake-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B0009X7BDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Layer Cake (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled-Two-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Boiled (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000009EBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer  -  Criterion Collection</a>.",1203465600,,2098,7.159533073929961
