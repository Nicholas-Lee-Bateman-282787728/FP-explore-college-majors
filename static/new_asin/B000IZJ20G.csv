I had changed, the drama hadn't changed. I changed my perspective entirely on the Kim Ha Neul character and I now believe that after her film Ditto this is her best performance, it is fascinating and complex. She is a professional photographer and was torn between two men she had grown up with as children in an orphanage. One she had really only thought of as a friend and the other she romanticized because she thought for over a decade that he had lost his life trying to grab a beloved keepsake she had accidentally dropped in a river. That boy is assumed drowned, but floats downstream and does not die; he is adopted by a Korean and Japanese married couple. The girl in adulthood finds out that he is in fact alive but his name had been changed to a Japanese one upon adoption and they don't recognize each other at first. Meanwhile the other boy assumes that someday he will marry the girl. The second time around I saw the plot much more from her point of view - she never led the other boy on, he was the one who was living in LaLaLand thinking he would have a future with her just because she was nice to him. He needed to grow up, and he does, but unexpected plot twists occur that make the process VERY intense. SPOILER! As for the much misunderstood ending, people need to watch carefully (and most don't): Lee Dong Gun is about to board a flight to Japan but (LISTEN CAREFULLY FOLKS!) HE CHANGES HIS MIND. He changes direction and walks back out the entrance doors. That means ... drumroll, clueless ones, HE IS STAYING IN KOREA and will wait for Kim Ha Neul to return from Europe. It's a happy ending, folks, so don't give this drama a low grade just because you didn't understand that. Watch this classic K-drama for the phenomenal acting, and gorgeous OST music score. I have watched 365 Korean dramas as of this writing and Stained Glass is one of the best classics.",1518652800,,2039,4.382585751978892
8148036,3,B000IZJ20G,The ending was so disappointing. Will probably watch it again but not the last episode. After spending 17 hours of drama and then being let down. Not a crier but almost cried.,1478217600,,175,4.5
8148037,5,B000IZJ20G,I love this korean drama. Good quality.,1422748800,,39,4.714285714285714
8148038,4,B000IZJ20G,I really enjoyed this series. Lee Dong Gun looked great and the acting was very good. I wish I could have seen more of Yoo Min. I liked her much better than Kim Ha Neul. I'd love to own this series; but for now I'll have to continue to rent it. Maybe one day.,1369699200,,259,3.814814814814815
8148039,3,B000IZJ20G,"I gave this drama 3 stars because of the ending. It's a ""What the heck?"" ending and leaves you ticked off because you've spent hours with these characters knowing love will prevail or that there will a resolution between two main characters. It is the story of three friends, two boys and one girl, of competition and rivalry, love and loyalty. I actually enjoyed it...until the end. Still, if the price isn't too steep, it is worth purchasing.",1358985600,,444,4.705128205128205
8148040,4,B000IZJ20G,"Since other reviewers have dealt with the story-line, I'll not repeat it.  My reason for writing a review is to attempt to pursuade others to purchase this beautifully-filmed, 18-episode series because of it's philosophical impact.  This story will linger in your mind for weeks because of the many messages regarding the interactions of friends and/or family and the affects on individuals which, very often, are deep and hidden.  The three lead actors -- Kim Ha Neul, Lee Dong-geon, and Kim Seong-su -- are outstanding in this production; they are familiar faces and have been seen in many series, but this one gave each actor a chance to show a range of emotions.",1337472000,2,666,4.928571428571429
