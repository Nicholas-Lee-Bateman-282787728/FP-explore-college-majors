8538919,2,B00435VETE,"Next to the Beatles this is by far my favorite non American pop group of all time. When I ordered this I was aware from the product description that there would be comments and reviews from well known industry persons. This would have been fine if they had confined their comments either prior to or after the tracks ran. Instead, they talked while the tracks ran in the background. ABBA truly were pop Music Masters of their time and beyond, and the title is appropriately named. This product as done is an insult to the quality and dignity of the wonderful body of musical work of ABBA.
