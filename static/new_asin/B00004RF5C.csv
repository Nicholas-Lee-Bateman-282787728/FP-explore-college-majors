7920940,3,B00004RF5C,"Stephanie Herman, a dancer, has created a mostly low-impact aerobics workout which incorporates ballet, jazz, and both yoga and Pilates principles.  She begins with simple stretches combined with a focus on breathing.  The warmup then seamlessly flows into a low-impact workout with moves reminiscent of Tai Chi (similar to Petra Kobler's BREATHE).  She then turns up the heat with more medium impact moves (much like in the video Tantric Toning).  The next section, which she calls ""Olympic,"" is even more challenging, and it includes balance moves as well as ballet-type kicks.  This is followed by a dance-y jazz segment which Stephanie says is supposed to be fun.  Finally, Stephanie ends the workout with a series of ballet stretches; the total length comes in at 42 minutes.
Stephanie was a likeable instructor, but her voice was often muffled and difficult to hear.  In addition, she frequently failed to cue new movements, and she provided little explanation of how to perform the exercises.  However, she does mention that all of the exercises can be learned through one of her other videos, Fitness Through Conscious movement--I've never done this one, but I assume that it provides more detailed instruction.  One thing I did like is how Stephanie gave repeated reminders to be aware of your abdominals while performing the movements.  Although there were some good things about this workout, I found myself looking forward to it being over, so I don't think I'll be reaching for this one again.",1078876800,,1506,5.085365853658536
7920941,4,B00004RF5C,"Stephanie Herman's video workout, ""Esprit De Dance"" offers a beautiful, enjoyable road to fitness. The video is complicated enough to keep you interested yet, simple enough for even beginners to learn. I am a 24 year old woman who decided it was time to start exercising. In the past, the only exercise that appealed to me was swimming. However I needed something a little more practical to help me get into shape. I found this video at my local public library and have been enjoying it ever since.  As a beginner with absolutely no dance experience I found learning the dances to be challanging and fun. I had to rewind the tape quite often in order to figure out the steps. However, it did not take long to master and I have been enjoying it more every day.  This video offers a low impact workout with beautiful music. It does not become routine because there are so many layers to the workout. Once you master the moves you can concentrate on your body positioning, poise and fluidity.  Finally a workout that makes me feel elegant and graceful while strengthening my body at the same time.",980812800,11,1094,4.6
