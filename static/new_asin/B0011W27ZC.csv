8242786,5,B0011W27ZC,"'the making of a continent' in the documentive,pbs aired form, is the best on the subject.  why pbs won't see to it that it is released to dvd is absurd!  given the fact that a lot of interested parties would want this set of programs,it really should be made available.  i don't care for a fancy box;dvd extras;anything else other than the complete series for my collection!  i am still watching it on 'over twenty'year old vhs;thank god, they all still play nicely! my favorite episode: ""corridors of time"".  the narration is first rate,without being too teachy!  the photography is way out there too!! helps you really to understand that we are on a changing planet that sets it's own rules: for life that's been and for life that is yet to come, the earth is truly in charge of everything. no doubt about that!  so, please, whomever reads this critique,for lack of another word, 'forge on' and get this wonderful program on dvd.",1285113600,2,932,4.646341463414634
