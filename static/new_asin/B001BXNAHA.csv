8628067,4,B001BXNAHA,"I made this movie. People now forget how little Americans knew about China in 1973 when we made this film. Health care in rural areas is still lacking, not only in China, but in the rest of the world, including the US. Given easy access to the internet, people should focus on barefoot-doctor style on-going education to raise health awareness focused on prevention. A medical system based on curative treatments is too costly for any nation.",1407110400,,442,4.828947368421052
8628068,4,B001BXNAHA,"The Barefoot Doctors of Rural China, although filmed in the 1970s, enables viewers an overview of life in villages and farming communities in certain parts of China during this time period.  Daily living can be seen with its limitations without many modern conveniences that are taken for granted for populations in cities in both China and other counties.  These Chinese are a proud, resourceful, and tenacious people as evidenced by the children having their tonsil tissues removed in multiple sessions by cauterization with big smiles on their faces, as they say, ""Ah"".  The `barefoot doctors' are really paramedic type of individuals with various levels of training and skills who walk barefoot through the farmlands, which is typical of this rural population. The film is not of the quality we are used to and even film made during the 1970s did a little better than this.  Nevertheless, I have sent this video to a few doctor friends toward further understanding of this population and its healthcare needs and practices and how some still might have relevance today.  If you are interested at all in other populations, their healthcare issues, and ways in which they do things, you should find this video instructive and useful.  Since traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds an interest for me, I found the herbal growing, seeking pure fields to maintain integrity of their botanicals, and the old methods of herbal preparation historically informative.  I was impressed by the resourceful ways in which the barefoot doctors tried to attend to fundamental preventive care needs such as water contamination prevention, parasite control, inoculations, infectious disease control, simple public health education, as well as major prevention.  I was particularly impressed with the basic innovation and endurance of the people.
