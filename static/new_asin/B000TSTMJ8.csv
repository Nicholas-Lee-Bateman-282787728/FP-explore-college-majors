8407294,5,B000TSTMJ8,"I first saw this film in 1990 on SBS television as a teenager and I thought it was a really cool film. I just finished seeing it again and I think it is just as good now as it was back then. Dani Levy and Anja Franke are great together, the black and white photography also looks really good, and I like all of the different elements of the film.
One annoying thing about this DVD is the interview with Dani Levy talking about Du mich auch has no English subtitles, the film has English subtitles but not the interview.
I recommend this film to anyone that likes really cool art-house  films, or anyone that just likes good art.",1342915200,,628,4.277310924369748
