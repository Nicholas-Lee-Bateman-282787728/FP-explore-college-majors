8252530,3,B0013PVGHW,"I purchased this volume for ""Danger Zone"" which, while entertaining, was really part of a proposed tv series, according to reports I've read. One can tell that it unfolds like a tv show rather than a feature film. The theatrical release ""The Big Chase"" was also entertaining but with all the flair of a good tv show of the era. ""David Harding, Counterspy"" initially held no interest for me when I purchased the dvd but ironically turned out to be a very good film of its kind and the best of this volume's three offerings.",1210377600,7,522,4.505263157894737
