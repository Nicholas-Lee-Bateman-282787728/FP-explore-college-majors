8600792,3,B002PLQHF4,"This DvD I believe was made in 2009. I was expecting footage from atleast 2006 - 2009. The footage on this dvd is from 2002 - 2004. a lot of the same footage that is on the previous 2 ultra dvds. The sound quality on this dvd is not that good either. I believe on the cover it says the dvd was made in Argentina, what the hell is that about. I think this dvd is just to sucker you into getting the audio cd that comes with it, which is not that good either, I think their are only 2 decent tracks on there. Good thing this dvd was cheap.",1294704000,4,537,3.8468468468468466
