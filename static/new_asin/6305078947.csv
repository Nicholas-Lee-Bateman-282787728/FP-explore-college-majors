993028,5,6305078947,"This fascinating and suspenseful tale of melancholy blends top notch camera work with quintessential serendipity.  A group of mostly greedy family members gather at midnight for the reading of a will that should pay real dividends, but only for one.  And this will features a very personal touch from the dearly departed! There are bumps in the night galore, wickedly funny thrills, and even a booby hatch or two.  And, oh, by the way, it doesn't help much that a deranged lunatic is at large (IN THE HOUSE)!  Still, by today's standards it might be a little too silent and gloomy if not for a well chosen stereo sound track. This is unequivocally the best version of ""The Cat and the Canary"" despite not being the most popular.  It is also the oldest.  Now on a personal note: Many moons ago, several long departed family members of mine were subjected to a highly regarded and nightmarish silent movie that remained ever so present in their delicate minds.  But the memories were fresh enough to provoke an occasional mentioning, usually in hushed tones.  This was a film they had viewed in their formative years on a Saturday afternoon, inside a smallish structure located within the boundaries of the home town park.  As young children, they remembered a person called ""the narrator"" reading horrific subtitles as a conspicuous and repugnant hand (a hand that makes ""Thing"" of ""The Addams Family"" look like a stool pigeon!) was prominently displayed in the backdrop behind unsuspecting victims.  The capacity of the human mind to recall can be both a blessing and a curse--Certainly cruel and unusual punishmnent to these innocent children whose fragility had been exposed by a talented but unknowing director named Paul Leni.  Time often distorts reality but their vivid descriptions of the fright and terror they endured by virtue of being strapped to a chair for eighty some odd minutes whild watching ""The Cat and the Canary"" doesn't bode well.  Much of this was clearly a bad omen for the tragic lives that ensued.  At least one developed ""endostosis"", a condition in which the vascular connective tissue lining the marrow cavities of bones results in the formation of bone within the cartilage.  Others faired even worse.  Ironically, this production is considered a milestone of the American horror film even though it had a German director.",970185600,9,2352,4.9491094147582695
993029,4,6305078947,"DVD releases of old silent films have tended to enjoy mixed fortunes - certain releases of 'Metropolis' and 'The Lodger' have received shockingly bad treatment. Rest assured though, 'The Cat and the Canary' is an example  to every DVD distributor of how to treat a vintage 'classic'. The movie  boasts a superb newly recorded (1997) stereo soundtrack that compliments  the images very well indeed. The soundtrack even contains sound effects  such as door knocks and clock chimes which help compensate for the lack of  real sound. Speech cards, often hazy and unclear in other silent films, are  here clean, crisp and easily readable. This is because the title cards are  shown in freeze frame, a technique other distributors should take note of.  The film itself is a very enjoyable 80 minutes 'old dark house' romp that  never takes itself too seriously. The cast blends together well and the  characters are really quite fun and likable. The camera work is also worthy  of praise. The director, Paul Leni, provides us with interesting angles and  dynamic camera movement throughout the film. If you love silent movies then  'The Cat and the Canary' makes a very worthy addition to your collection.  Finally, I must just mention the Harold Lloyd short 'Haunted Spooks' which  is included on the DVD. This is the one where Harold tries to commit  suicide by standing in front of an oncoming tram, jumping off a bridge into  two feet of water and shooting himself with a water pistol. A classic in  it's own right!",963705600,16,1513,4.866666666666666

Its easy to see the influence this film has had on generations of horror films and thrillers.  For the viewer who can appreciate (or tolerate) tropes that  became dated long ago (i.e., the hand extending unseen from a hidden panel behind the heroines head), there is much to enjoy here, and much that remains fresh even today.  The use of dissolves, superimpositions, lighting, and camera movements is often startling and even exhilarating as one can sense the activity of creative minds figuring out the grammar of film.

993314,4,6305078947,"Director Paul Leni (The Man Who Laughs) leads us on a pleasurable trip of mystery and comedy during this 84 minute movie from 1927.  One of the first haunted house movies it is not scary by todays standards but is quite enjoyable.  An eccentric millionaire passed away twenty years ago and his greedy relatives now gather at his grotesque mansion for a reading of the will.  Just like a cat around a canary.

The lucky heir must be declared sane by a doctor.  Who will it be?  Is he or she sane? Who is trying to stop if from happening?  Are the West diamonds real?  A creepy killer, an escaped lunatic, a spooky housekeeper, a missing lawyer, a freaky doctor, a revolving bookcase, and more!  The charming Laura La Plante and great supporting cast persuade me to recommend this for all.  The quality is very good and it comes with two musics scores that work well.  (I hate to admit I did not figure out who the culprit is.)

The 22 minute comedy short Haunted Spooks with Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis is a bonus!  After her grandfather dies they must live in the family mansion for a year or it will go to her uncle.  Her uncle uses ghosts to thwart them.  Doubtful he will succeed.  Lots of laughs are found here especially Harolds hair-raising experience.  I nominate  this for everyone who would like to see a pleasant reminder of what silent cinema is.",1414281600,,1360,4.481632653061224

993408,4,6305078947,"This 1927 silent film is the forerunner of later comedy horror films. Captions are provided but don't cover a lot of the dialog. However, the movie is easy to follow as facial expressions and gestures are exaggerated.  Agatha Christie did not write this play, John Willard did, but folk trapped in a spooky mansion with a murderer afoot would be right up her alley.

Twenty years after the death of wealthy Cyrus West his relatives are summoned to his old mansion for the reading of his will. Hovering in charge of the mansion is a creepy housekeeper, rather of the ilk of Mrs. Danvers. She can suddenly cross her eyes until she is looking at her nose, certainly an original touch! Several nieces and nephews gather to hear from Cyrus's lawyer who will get the fortune. The youngest and prettiest niece, Annabelle, played by Laura la Plante, is the beneficiary but the group, locked in the old house overnight, is stalked by a mystery figure and an insane asylum escapee, known as ""The Cat,"" finds refuge in the mansion and hides there. There is a lot of thrashing around and screaming as you can imagine.

The film is a deep sepia in tone but whether that was the intended color rather than a result of age, I don't know. The movie isn't really scary and is often funny either intentionally or otherwise but it is interesting as the corner stone of film horror. There are many artistically effective touches like the snarling black cats at the beginning, and spooky flashlight sequences. As the clock strikes midnight, when the will is read, you see the inside mechanism of the clock with the hammers striking eerily. Chairs coved with protective padding look exactly like tombstones. Not ""Psycho"" or ""The Shining"" that's for sure, the film is nevertheless interesting and fun and definitely a role model for what was to come in horror-comedy films.",1394409600,3,1850,4.757009345794392

993410,4,6305078947,"Even though this is a silent movie, I enjoyed it and got some laughs out of it.  In my opinion it was well done for the era.  I would watch it again.",1394064000,,149,3.625
993411,2,6305078947,"The first thing that you should know is that this is a silent picture.  For anyone too young to know what that means, it has no spoken dialog, only a music soundtrack added long after shooting.  Dialog and story progression is via written text in frames inserted between scenes.  I didn't notice this in the description.

I'm not a big fan of silent movies in general.  I rather enjoy well-done black & white, however.  A good director can tell a story with shadow and light.  I didn't find that in ""Cat Canary,"" either.  The shots were acceptable, but not exceptional.

Some of the acting was rather good, given the limitations of the medium.  Most of the scenes didn't provide good opportunities for better performances, in my opinion somewhat mundane and familiar.  That might be slightly unfair, given the age of the movie.  For today's audience, I think it's accurate.

If you love old, old movies or have a penchant for history, ""Cat Canary"" might be just the ticket.  It is representative of its era, and it probably was good quality for its day.

The rest of us might want to pass.  There are really much better B&W movies out there.",1393632000,2,1141,4.63

993464,5,6305078947,"It's interesting to see this type of film evolve over time. It's a mystery in a spooky house revolving around an inheritance and I won't say any more about the about plot.(One thing you can be sure, I never give key points of these movies away to spoil the movie for you if you get it. There is nothing worse than giving the movie key points away as so many reviewers do. Have you been to movies and someone said 'so and so' did it. I mean why watch it after that B S has been done to spoil it. On that note, don't read the DVD box until after you've watched the movie as once again the box gives away too much story. In fact this practice is so rampant that I make it a rule to never read the boxes until after watching the movies. They seem to assume that since this is a real old movie everyone must know what's it's all about. )

This movie is quite similar in so many aspects and details to the shorter (53 min.) silent ""Midnight Faces"" from the previous (1926) year, that much of this review takes the two films as virtually the same show, with slight differences, with this one being an improvement (at least in the aspect of suspenseful nature and length) over the other. It was complete with secret passages, a weird servant, rampant suspicions and insinuations, and cloak and dagger goings on, yet is something of a more serious attempt to create a suspenseful mystery than ""Midnight Faces"". This time the motive is plain, but the guilty party was, in my mind anyway, impossible to spot...maybe a second look would make it clearer.

It starts out with quite degraded, though not unwatchable footage, that is actually quite quaint in its grainy scratchy quality for the particular scene seen in it's duration (Scratchy graininess quickly fades and then diminishes over the period of the film so as to be completely absent at the end.) There is an interesting artistic bit of double exposure camerawork at the beginning. The finished footage is at times so dark as do be difficult to impossible to see clearly what is transpiring at time, which can be a nuisance with new (non HD) TV's that don't seem to allow you to adjust the contrast. But it's not a fatal flaw here by any stretch, as there were only a few sequences like this. I didn't notice any cropping or difficulty in reading text screens, so it appears properly formatted to ordinary TV screens. I felt the music was fine, thought not particularly spooky, and seldom if ever overdid it or didn't match the scenes.

The ""action"" was sometimes so turgid over such a long period of time that I started to nod off, yet it was still more suspenseful overall. This was a bit of a mix of clay and steel, in that actions were often at odds with apparent characterizations, which served to obscure solution to the watcher. But it also meant that, in retrospect, some of the actions were illogical. Some acting was so lame and campy as to be laughable. There was an imbalance of exposure to some of the characters in the mystery too, which also made solution to the watcher virtually impossible. Indeed there were some actions that took place that were never really understood or explained in the grand finally. There is a person in the film who looks hilariously frightful when first spotted, but I won't say any more as it would give important plot bits away. Admittedly then there are story weaknesses, but they don't seem to detract from the movie in the final analysis.

Overall I quite enjoyed this feature length (101 minutes) film immensely as it had a neat suspenseful flavour, even if almost ludicrously so, right from the beginning, and a nifty haunty look and feel to the entire film.

- The reading of the will in a scary looking isolated castle or mansion that is reported to be haunted
- A strange codicil to the will- usually one stating that the heir(s) must spend at least one night in the haunted place
- Greedy heirs
- Fake bookcases with secret passages
- Someone trying to scare everyone off by pretending to be a ghost or maniac
- Creepy servant(s)
- An absent (in this case, deceased) host... I could go on and on.
I thought the sepia tone would make it hard to view but the picture quality was pretty good. And with there being no sound, I thought the silence and subtitles would be irritating after a while.

993547,5,6305078947,"Even before their great monster classics of the '30s, Universal Studios was already laying the groundwork for horrors to come with influential silent films like THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927). At the time, it was a successful stage melodrama about a group of relatives gathering together for the nightly reading of a will in a spooky old mansion.

Directed by the ingenious Paul Leni, this first film version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (it was remade in 1930, '39, and '78) established many of the ingredients that became cliches in countless haunted house mysteries: stormy nights, long, dark corridors, billowing curtains, clutching hands, sliding panels, disappearing corpses, and hooded killers. Leni creatively combined all of this with expressionistic visuals and touches of humor that offset the chills. The result is a highly entertaining movie that keeps you guessing who the notorious escaped maniac known as ""The Cat"" might be.

Kino's DVD edition was restored from original nitrate elements and it looks terrific; the sharpness and contrast levels are consistent, with nice color tinting throughout. Neil Brand's original music score is appropriately eerie.

If you want a good, scary, old silent flick to snuggle up with on a rainy night, THE CAT AND THE CANARY fits the bill perfectly.",1334620800,,1297,5.166666666666667

Finished watching The Cat & the Canary, I didn't realize it was a comedy. What a hoot, almost Laurel & Hardy. When the old Universal logo moved across the screen (the one of the globe with the plane that flies around it with clouds following in its wake) I thought, ""I'd of bought this just for that. The old fonts used were great!

It was easy to see how this established the template for the haunted house movies as all the elements are there except, someone you want dead. I thought of many shows while watching this one. The House reminded me of the movie the people are watching in The Mirror Crack'd. The hand reminded me of Nosferatu, Salem's Lot & one of my favorites The Legacy. The black cat's reminded me of a movie that's three shows in one but I can't think of the title (it maybe The Cat's Eye). I found it impossible not to think of the movie Clue while watching this.

***SPOILERS***

Laura La Plante was a really cute pixie girl in this & the scaredy cat guy who loved her (CREIGHTON HALE) & found his gumption when she was threatened physically was a hoot. Aunt Susan on the motorbike (cavalry to the rescue) is great too but the look she puts on her face as the big cop lifts her onto his motorbike is priceless. The moth, what a great shot.

I loved the score, it was far more fitting than the plot, as revealed on the inter-cards, but as I said, the images are certainly the standard for haunted house pictures since then from comedies to horror. *** SPOILER*** The shot where the hand comes out of the wall & hovers over Annabelle's head & then darts at the camera just before grabbing the necklace was 3-D like & a genius move.

The characters as played are a bit too loveable for me. I needed a couple of characters I'd like to see dead. The old house keeper was the creepiest of them but I couldn't even wish her harm. Some great facial shots kept this interesting for me.

Overall I'd give it 4 stars for it's molding of a genre. The images are wonderful, the storyline on the inter-cards much less believable. I mean, ***SPOILER***20 years after your dead, your wishes & desires concerning your estate have no more life left in this world than you would, a giant mistake in my mind. PS: IMO the housekeeper should have been in on it.

This is a good restoration with some streaks & spots at the beginning, but a nice copy of a very old movie. The old film restored for Metropolis was much, much worse damaged. Sound track was clear as a bell.",1313107200,2,2537,4.394456289978678

It would have been a much better in black and white.

993630,4,6305078947,"When it comes to silent films, it's one thing to tell people you love silent comedies or silent dramas but the mere mention of silent horror films may make some chuckle.  Afterall, many people are not familiar with silent films and their images of silents are of the comedy kings Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, the innocent Mary Pickford or the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks.  But the truth is, there are a good number of horror films created back in the silent era not just in the United States but from other countries as well.

Fortunately, KINO International has given people a chance to sample classic American silent horror films through their DVD box set release titled ""American Silent Horror Collection"" featuring ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928), ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" (1920), ""The Cat and the Canary"" (1927), ""The Penalty"" (1920) and the documentary ""Kingdom of Shadows"".

One of the films I was definitely looking forward to seeing is the Paul Leni silent comedy horror classic ""The Cat and the Canary"" which was an adaptation of the  popular stage play by John Willard (and would go on to have three more film adaptations in 1930, 1930 and 1979).  ""The Cat and the Canary"" would feature German Expressionist filmmaker Paul Leni in the first of four films he would create for Universal Studio films in the late 1920's until his death from blood poisoning caused by an ulcerated tooth in 1929.

""The Cat and the Canary"" would still include Leni's German Expressionist style by incorporating psychological horror with the use of scary and dark set design, camera angles and lighting but for this film, it would utilize comedy in a way that would tone down the darkness of the film by adding a dose of humor which the American audience would enjoy.  Sure enough, the film was a box office success and received positive critical reviews back in 1927

""The Cat and Canary"" begins with an introduction about an old millionaire named Cyrus West who lived in a spooky mansion overlooking the Hudson River.  He is close to death but because his family members are greedy and descended upon him like cats around a canary, Cyrus West has made a request that his last will and testament must be locked up in a safe and will not be read until the 20th anniversary of his death.  When the lawyer, Roger Crosby (played by Tully Marshall)  comes to check on the will, he finds a live moth inside the safe.  He asks the West mansion caretaker Mammy Pleasant (played by Martha Mattox) who opened the safe and she tells him that it was the ghost of Cyrus West. Of course, Crosby doesn't buy that and knows someone had opened the safe and read the letter.  Who is responsible?

So, hours before the 20th anniversary, several family members arrive.  First the nephews Harry Blythe (played by Arthur Edmund Carewe) and a cousin he doesn't get along with Charles ""Charlie"" Wilder (played by Forrest Stanley).  The comes the clumsy and talkative Paul Jones (played by Creighton Hale) followed by Susan Sillsby (played by Flora Finch) and her daughter Cecily Yong (played by Gertrude Astor) and then finally, the latest West's niece Annabelle West (played by Laura La Plante).

When the clock strikes to midnight, the will is opened and the fortune of Cyrus West would be given to his niece Annabelle.  But there is a stipulation.  In order to inherit the fortune, she must be judged as ""sane"" by Dr. Ira Lazar (played by Lucien Littlefield).  If she is insane, the fortune will be passed onto the second name on the will.

Meanwhile, the mansion guard (played by George Siegmann) tells them than an escaped convict known as ""The Cat"" has escaped and he is on the grounds of the mansion and he is maniac who thinks he is a cat and tears his victims like they were canaries.  Worried that someone may be up to their tricks in getting the fortune left by Cyrus, Crosby wants an immediate talk with Annabelle.

While the lawyer Crosby and Annabelle sit to discuss the will, he tells her that because someone had tampered with the will, that person named as the second person may try to do prevent her from getting the fortune.  And while she sits and listens to the lawyer, we see a big monster like hand come out a revolving shelf and captures Crosby and yanks him in behind-the-wall.

When Annabelle hears the faint scream, she turns around but he is already gone and she begins to scream.  She tells everyone that Crosby is gone but yet, everyone starts to think ""maybe she will go insane"" or ""maybe she is crazy"".

Meanwhile, as Annabelle stays in her room, she quickly opens the letter left to her by Cyrus West.  The letter tells her that stuffed behind the fireplace, there is a button which will reveal where he had stashed jewelry.  She eventually finds it and puts it on herself.  When she goes to sleep, we see the monster hand coming out of the wall and steals the diamonds from her neck which makes Anabelle scream and waking up her other family members.

As everyone rushes in, she tells them what happened but when they look on the wall, there it's solid.  At first they think that she is going insane like Cyrus West but when Annabelle triggers a button on the wall, we see the dead body of the lawyer Crosby fall out.  Someone has killed him and now everyone is afraid.

Now everyone fears that the maniac known as Cat are now coming after them.  Stuck in a mansion they think is haunted, everyone begins to fear for what might become of them during the night.  Will any of them be alive by the morning?

VIDEO:

""The Cat and the Canary: The Photoplay Restoration"" features another wonderful restoration courtesy of filmmakers Kevin Brownlow and Patrick Stanbury.  The picture quality is presented in 1:33:1 and is color tinted.  The 83-year-old film does have its share of scratches and dust but really, compared to many other silent films, this is standard and the actual picture quality of this film on DVD is very good.  It will be very interesting if this release is considered for Blu-ray by KINO International in the near future.

AUDIO & INTERTITLES:

""The Cat and the Canary"" features music by a score by Neil Brand and the members of The City of Prague Philharmonic conducted by Timothy Brock.  The music was very well-done for this film!  Intertitles were easy to read as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Cat and the Canary"" comes with stills of the cast.  You can use your remote to cycle through the various stills included on the DVD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Cat and the Canary"" was one film that I really have wanted to see for a long time.  My only familiarity of ""The Cat and the Canary"" was for the 1939 adaptation starring Bob Hope and Paulette Godard film (which by the way, was re-released in 2010 as part of the ""Bob Hope: Thanks for the Memories Collection"" DVD box set).  But I definitely was curious because of clips I saw of certain shots of the mansion, how angles made it to look quite eerie, especially how the lighting would be lit on one end and very dark on the other, to give a feeling of ""don't go that way...or else something bad may happen"".

I suppose this film can be considered one of the first ""haunted house"" films.  From being filled with cobwebs and the various trickdoor placements, there was probably nothing like it back in the early years of Hollywood and thus, this film may have been the first to showcase the house being used in such a way.

But part of my enjoyment of the film was watching the different cast members.  Laura La Plante was absolutely delightful as the character Annabelle West and Creighton Hale's Paul Jones definitely brought a Harry Langdon-esque type of feel to the character.  Gertrude Astor brought the socialite stubborness to her character of Cecily Young but I have to say that Arthur Edmund Carewe and Forrest Stanley were not utilized as much as I would have like to build upon their feelings of the death of Crosby to whatever was going on in the house.  The film tends to focus more on Annabelle, Paul, Cecily and her Aunt Susan Sillsby.

But still, the characters were still well-incorporated to the film, the story's pacing was well-done and in the end, I actually enjoyed the film a lot, for a comedy horror film for the late '20s.  I'm not sure how audiences felt back then in 1927 if they considered ""The Cat and the Canary"" as more scary or more humorous but for me, watching it in 2010, one thing I can see is why the audiences enjoyed it and why it was a box office success.  It was a well-done film incorporating American comedy along with German Expressionism and the melding of the two worked out amazingly well.

I do wish there were more special features, it would have been nice to watch a special feature on the director Paul Leni or event he actress Laura la Plante (who was a huge star for Universal Studios back then).  But you still get stills from the film and as for the DVD itself, the restoration by Brownlow and Stanbury for Photoplay was as awesome as their other previous Photoplay restorations.  And the music by Niel Brand, performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic and conducted by Timothy Brock was also well-done.

Overall, ""The Cat and the Canary"" is a fantastic comedy/horror silent classic of yesteryear and a wonderful inclusion in the ""American Silent Horror Collection"" DVD box set.",1290470400,2,9317,4.638025594149909
993631,5,6305078947,"Cyrus West, millionaire, leaves his fortune to Annabelle West, his good-hearted, distant relative, the only one who has not been stalking him, like cats after a canary. But she must be proven sane, and she must spend the night in the house Cyrus's ghost now haunts. What follows is a comedy-thriller in which the rest of the family try to scare Annabelle out of the house, or out of her mind. The Cat and the Canary is the prototypical haunted house movie, to which almost all haunted house movies owe their basic look and plot.

Cat and the Canary was first a stage play, and highly popular in that format. But Paul Leni, a German director who transplanted to the United States as the Nazi regime was taking over, brought the German expressionist style that has become the prototype of the haunted house. His use of light and shadow, even the layout of the house can be seen in everything from The House on Haunted Hill to Young Frankenstein to Scooby Doo.

The plot of Cat and the Canary is simple enough: Cyrus West, a millionaire who has been stalked by his family--like a canary pursued by cats--died 20 years ago. Since then, only his ghost and his faithful housekeeper, Mammy Pleasant [Martha Mattox] have resided in the house. But, as stipulated, at midnight, 20 years from the day of his death, his will is read. To thwart his greedy family, Cyrus leaves everything to his most distant relative, Annabelle [Laura La Plante], and the only good-hearted, greedless one among them. But, she must be proven sane, and she must spend the night in the house.

What ensues is a comedy-thriller in which the family is tormented by hauntings while trying to scare Annabelle out of the house and out of her wits. Of course, they fail, and, with Cyrus's assistance and that of the smitten Paul [Creighton Hale], Annabelle winds up with the fortune.

Cat and the Canary is a silent film, and, as I've said before, a good silent movie is a hard movie to make. So much depends on the actors expressions and body language, enhanced by angles, light and music. At this, Leni (and the other Expressionists of his movement) was a master. Little dialogue (provided on text inserts, as is the convention in silent movies) is needed to convey a full range of emotions, as well as the plot. And to see the beginnings of the haunted house motif is a treat as well.

The print is a restoration of the original, highly fragile nitrate prints. Though overly dark, they still represent an excellent, even incredible work of restoration. The original score, which would have been played on the piano in the theater, is unfortunately lost, but Neil Brand does a good job of recreating the time, though the soundtrack at times is a bit over-the-top. Brand is too aware of the influence of the movie, and the modern versions of the haunted house motif interfere with his ability to capture 1937. Still, it fits well enough to make you feel as if you are almost watching the original, wonderful film.",1287187200,,2975,4.64828897338403

The actors are perfectly cast. Although Arthur Edmund Carewe has a small part in the movie, he certainly stands out and gives one of his best performances. I had to do a double-take at first, because he did not look like the Mr. Carew I saw in Phantom of the Opera. There is a eery feeling throughout and the backdrops are beautifully gothic. The camera play is excellent for the time, watch the movement and different pitches...wonderfully done. Everything about this movie is 5-star, from the acting, the use of camera and the music. A MUST HAVE if you are an old movie buff like me. This one has to be in your collection if you are a seeker of great old horror movies.",1270598400,2,833,4.450980392156863

While movie effects have come a long way, this film is so well dramatized that it all falls perfectly into place.

The following night, I sat my 13 yo to watch at 11:00 pm, thinking he would fall asleep because of the late hour. He not only watched the whole movie, he thoroughly enjoyed it!

In short, it is a mystery . . . a murder . . . a theft all within one night, as the family gathers to read the well of Cryus West, who died twenty years ago, at the stroke of midnight. The lawyer knows something is amiss but you must watch it to the end to find out culprit. And with all silent films there is a fabulous hero scene who throws down with the best of them!

I am not very much into silent films, but this film is simply timeless for those who can still see the magic of movies and who those who are willing to take a chance.",1258502400,3,1135,4.035555555555556
993635,5,6305078947,"He suspects he is being threatened to help make him crazy. His relatives have her around him my cats watching a canary.

Even though the story is formula, this is an excellent presentation of who is included in the will and the old man dies. There a few different variances in this presentation. First the will is not to be opened till 20 years after the old man's death. And someone has tampered with the envelope the names the successor is a person named in the will is also proven to be crazy.

So the inheritor the ""will"" will now become the new canary being watched by all the other cats in the family. We watch as one by one it looks like they will be dispatched starting with... oh no you don't, watch the movie and find out. And of course this just enforces the suspicion that the inheritor is crazy.

Of course as usual it's always the last person you suspect, it's in an old dark house, secret passages and spooky looking eyes and hairy hands and suspects running from room to room.

Laura La Plante plays the innocent but extremely cute looking niece. Martha Mattox places sinister looking caretaker that watched over the house for 20 years (and the safe with the will). Tully Marshall plays a crusty old lawyer who gets to read the will. Creighton Hale gets to play the comic relief the thoughtful cousin and maybe a bit more.

For those of you expecting a talkie you're going to be disappointed. For the rest of us you can actually see their mouths worked and they actually are saying what is being printed. The fun part of the movie is when the characters express themselves in explicative the written cards are expressed in metacharacters (probably helps get around those ~!@#$%^ scenarios.) There is a good sound score in the background.

This is well worth adding to your silent collection and periodically viewing for missed nuances.

Although any version of this film is worth watching I suggest you look for the restored photography version.",1252281600,,1961,4.617816091954023

It is beautifully executed and one can but admire the genuis behind its conception.  For example, in the earliest shots, we see a small man, the size of a bird (canary), dwarved by bottles, and behind the bottles are huge images of cats waiting to strike the man.  A powerful image to convey how he was being stalked by his greedy relatives, like a canary by avaricious cats.  The movie is replete with such amazing imagery.

The story is based on a stage play about the reading of a will twenty years after death and who will inherit all the millions.",1217203200,2,681,4.540983606557377
993637,5,6305078947,"From the moment a woman's gloved hand wipes away spider webs to reveal the opening credits, this precurser to all old dark house mysteries is stylish. Director Paul Leni blends chills and humor to help create an entire genre at Universal copied for decades. As with most things, however, the first is the best.

John Willard's stage play begins with a visually stylish opening as old millionaire Cyrus West is about to pass, his relatives hovering like cats around a canary. His will provides the last laugh, however, as it is not to be opened until 20 years after his death. His ghost is said to haunt the cobwebbed halls of the mansion in the meantime.

Once again his relatives from near and far gather on a dark night with greed in their eyes. A live moth in Cyrus's safe, however, reveals that one of them, or perhaps a madman who is on the loose, has already taken a peak. When sweet but distant relative Annabelle West (Laura La Plante) surprisingly receives the fortune, no one could be happier for her than Paul Jones (Creighton Hale). The timid Paul is very much in love with her, and will attempt in a humorous manner to protect her when a second document stipulates she must spend the night at the mansion and prove her sanity to receive the fortune.

Creighton Hale, best known to silent fans as a serial hero, has some fine comedic moments mixed with the thrills. One such moment occurs as he hides under a bed and must shield his eyes when lovely Cecily (Gertrude Astor) undresses. He must do so again for a very different reason when her aunt Susan does the same!

La Plante is marvelous as usual and the ending doesn't disappoint, retaining the film's sense of lighthearted fun, with some chills mixed in along the way. So well executed and entertaining is this old dark house mystery that it continues to influence the genre even today.

In a charming way, the visual aspects of silent film adds to the fun, rather than making it seem outdated. An escaped lunatic, stolen jewels, bodies and secret panels, and an old dark and isolated mansion high on a hill are staples copied many times, but rarely with such flair. It is a fun and atmospheric masterpiece of its genre.

The Alpha version contains an original and quite fabulous new music score from Nu Vu Du which enhances the atmosphere and fits perfectly with the mood of the film. A silent classic and a well balanced potpouri of humor and chills designed for a dark and rainy night with a big bowl of popcorn. Don't miss this one!",1214006400,3,2504,4.565701559020044

993639,5,6305078947,"The close of 2007 is an exciting time for silent film enthusiasts. A number of restorations of big name silent titles are still scheduled for release by year's end including BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN, NOSFERATU, THE IRON HORSE, and THE JAZZ SINGER (which despite its reputation is more silent than talkie). So far PANDORA'S BOX, TRUE HEART SUSIE, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and THE CAT AND THE CANARY have appeared with the last named being the winner in the restoration sweepstakes so far.

Considering previous versions of the film, this is the best looking one I've seen since METROPOLIS in 2003. The picture quality is outstanding (thanks to 35mm nitrate source materials), the film is complete (even the original Universal biplane opening is there), and the new score by Neil Brand fits the visuals perfectly (something which has not been the case in a few recent releases). Britain's Photoplay Productions remains the premiere restoration outfit in the business today not only because of the knowledge of people like co-founder Kevin Brownlow and the cooperation between various archive sources but also because of the additional funds they seem to have available to do the job right. We'll see how the others look once they're released but they'll be hard pressed to beat this one.

For those who have never seen it, THE CAT AND THE CANARY is the prototype old dark house film mixing murder, mirth, and mayhem with outstanding visuals and wonderful performances from all concerned. This new version allows you to see the film as audiences in 1927 must have seen it and gives you the opportunity of experiencing a silent film first hand. The print isn't perfect but it's darn close and as I mentioned earlier Neil Brand's score is an absolute delight.

If you've never seen a silent film before then this is a good place to start. If you're an old hand like me then you'll rejoice at just how good the restoration is.

In the wonderful Paul Leni Film, ""The Cat and the Canary,"" they manage to keep pulses low by never changing the tempo of the music (are they looking at the picture? Hello!!) and generally dragging the film down when it should be sprightly and spooky.
The companion feature, ""Haunted Spooks"" is a great print, lovely film, and the score at least is a bit better; but how much better it could be were it really great. It's a lost art that everyone thinks they can do, and so few can. Give me Carl Davis or Gaylord Carter any day.",1184112000,3,635,4.256198347107438

993702,2,6305078947,"We got this movie because my mom always talked about having seen it as a child (born in 1916).  She loved it then, and wanted so badly to see it again.  So we purchased it on Amazon - even got the special edition so it might have better audio & video, since her sight &  hearing aren't what they used to be.  We excitedly put it on for her, and proceeded to be bored out of our skulls (all of us, including her) for the entire duration of the movie!  I'm sure this might be great for a silent movie afficionado, but we couldn't wait for it to get over.

The ""bonus short feature"" however was hilarious.  It too is a silent movie, but even now, nearly a century after it was made, it is still very funny.  Unfortunately, it does have some very blatently racist scenes, typical of the times in which it was made.  But even those few scenes managed to be humorous, despite the distasteful racist stereotyping and patronization.  I believe that even most African Americans whom I know would find them comical (and it doesn't hurt that in at least one scene the black butler is the only one with any common sense, while the po' white folk run around in histerical terror).

If you're looking for a scare, or even an enjoyable look into the past, I would pass on this one unless you're a silent movie buff.  That is, of course, unless you're willing to pay the full price for the short feature.  Enjoy!",1138406400,4,1396,4.323076923076923
993703,5,6305078947,"This is the most famous of Haunted House spoofs, with its' collection of greedy relatives assembled for the reading of a will, mutual hatreds circulating around the lovely heiress (Laura La Plante) indeed proving her a helpless canary surrounded by hungry cats.

The opening sequence as a gloved hand brushes away the cobwebs to reveal the film's printed intertitle is a spectacular gimmick, which would be reused in 1943's SON OF DRACULA. In an old dark house with spiky battlements overlooking an ancient hilltop, the old Cyrus West cringes in an armchair, menaced by shadows that become giant medicine bottles and monstrous cats, and soon perishes. Now it is 20 years later and the greedy relatives of his acquaintance, with the accompany of the house maid (Martha Mattox), a family lawyer (Tully Marshall), and his daughter gather for the formal reading of his will and who will inherit his estate.

Director Paul Leni draws freshly on Expressionistic resources as characters lurch out of the darkness until their backs ominously blot out the entire screen; disembodied hands hovering timidly, curling round doorways, slowly reaching for the heroine's throat, and among the surprises is an uncanny similarity to Dr. Caligari. He arrives a mysterious stranger with pebble glasses and limp hands to announce ""I am the Doctor!"" The most arresting angle of all is the double exposure showing the mechanism of the clock that hasn't struck in years since the old Cyrus died. Finally the clock chimes midnight to laboriously gather its forces to start up again as the lights dim and the assembled company await.

Based on John Willard's 1922 stageplay, it would be remade in 1989 and 1978, however this still remains the best, and would certainly influence other Gothic chillers to come, most notably THE OLD DARK HOUSE and THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.",1127952000,4,1847,5.069078947368421
993704,4,6305078947,"The 1922 play THE CAT AND THE CANARY was so popular that it made the fortune of author John Willard, who lived to see it filmed no fewer than three times before his death in 1942.  Even today the story remains a classic of its kind, inspiring a host of films that mix comedy, mystery, and horror--not to mention still more that focus on suspicious doings in old, dark houses.  When questioned by author Gavin Lambert, director James Whale very specifically indicated that the 1927 film version, along with the 1928 THE LAST WARNING, influenced his own work in such films as FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE.

Both THE CAT AND THE CANARY and THE LAST WARNING were created for Universal by director Paul Leni.  But while THE LAST WARNING is not presently available to the home market, THE CAT AND THE CANARY most certainly is, and even some eighty years later is possible to see what all the fuss was about.  In term of cinematography, CAT is a remarkably imaginative film, using a series of over-lapping images, close-ups, and dissolves to astonishing effect.  In a visual sense it is easily one of the most stylish films of the silent era.

The plot is a classic of its kind.  Like the original Willard play, the film's story mixes a host of already-cliched ideas with several then-new ones.  Today, of course, it can be a bit difficult to them apart!  But even so it remains a fair amount of fun.  An eccentric millionaire has been hounded to death by his greedy relatives--and when he dies he leaves behind a will that imposes a twenty year waiting period between his death and delivery of his estate to his heir.  But who will the heir be?  The candidates assemble to hear the will at midnight... and no sooner is the heir named than strange doings are afoot.

The characters are archetypes: the nice girl (Laura La Plante), the mild-mannered boy (Creighton Hale), the fashion princess (Gertrude Astor), the battle ax matron (Flora Finch), and so on.  Perhaps most memorable is the housekeeper (Martha Mattox), an exceedingly dour woman most ironically named Mammy Pleasant!  Add in an exasperated lawyer, a creepy doctor, secret passages, hairy hands with needle-like finger nails, stolen diamonds, and as many dashes of comedy as you can get away with, mix well, and you have the inspiration for a seemingly endless list of classic films.

Although they may seem overly broad by modern standards, the cast plays at the level of what was considered comic-realistic in the late silent era, the production values are first rate, and the plot is quirky enough in a silly sort of way to make the whole thing fun.  But it is really the direction and the look of the thing that scores; in its best moments, THE CAT AND THE CANARY is plenty good indeed.

The film is available in several DVD releases.  You should avoid the Alpha release; although the picture is passable, the score is so dire that it completely undermines the film.  Although it clearly needs further restoration, the Image release is superior and offers your choice of scores, both of which work with the film rather than against it.  Recommended for silent fans and those interested in the development of the classic horror film!

993705,4,6305078947,"The plot was probably hackneyed back in 1927 - A childless, wealthy old man dies.  Twenty years later his will is to be read.  Relatives gather at his cobweb encrusted, dark and spooky old mansion.  One envelope will be opened naming the relative, a second envelope is to be opened only in the event the first heir is found to be insane.  Oh, yeah, and the night is dark and stormy and the old man's ghost is said to prowl about the drafty halls.  For some reason, everyone has to spend the night.  Hackneyed then, moth-eaten now, this story has been told and retold and parodied for 80 years.

  The silent THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) is a comedy-thriller, although the thrill-meter doesn't often move off zero, and when it does it doesn't move far.  The comedy depends in large part on a scared audience for tension-relieving laughter.  For a thriller-comedy that I didn't find much scary or funny, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie.

  German migr Paul Leni directed this visually stunning movie.  If the story itself was stale Leni redeemed it by pulling so many tricks out of his seemingly limitless repertoire and utilizing an uncanny sense of when to use what for greatest effect.  There are double and sometimes triple exposures, weird camera angles and character lighting, deep fields, narrow fields, claustrophobically tight close-ups.  You name it, Leni used it at the right time to achieve the right effect.  For instance, the character who is named first heir has to prove she is sane - a Dr. Caligari type alienist will arrive later.  There's a chance that the alternate heir is known, and none of the others can be trusted.  The heir is likened to old Cyrus West, who we see in the opening scene of the movie in a triple-exposed scene layering film of the old man languishing in a wheelchair, a screen full of medicine bottles, and glowering over it all is a trio of hissing cats, swiping sharps claws at the helpless old man.  The old man is the canary.  Later, after the will is read, the named heir is taken to a study by the lawyer, and the camera photographs her from behind a row of wooden chairs - the slats of which surround her, so she too looks like a golden-haired canary in a wooden cage. This is one of those rare, shining movies where seemingly every shot counts, and adds another layer of meaning to the story.

  Material enclosed with this dvd says Leni was in line to direct Universal's Dracula, but died of blood poisoning at the age of 44 in 1929, two years before Dracula was released.  It would have been interesting to see what this master director would done with the material.

  Also included on the Image dvd is a Hal Roach directed Harold Lloyd two-reeler, HAUNTED SPOOKS.  This slapstick silent IS funny, and like THE CAT AND THE CANARY the transfer print was in good to very good condition.  Overall recommended, primarily for a chance to see an example of a Paul Leni directed movie.",1111622400,9,2934,4.573896353166987
993706,5,6305078947,"If you want to purchase The Cat and the Canary, and can't figure out which version to get, this is definatly the one I would recommend. It is one of the best restorations I have seen yet.
Thoughtfully revised, it gives the viewer two choices in audio sound, the old fixed up original soundtrack, and a beautifull new soundtrack that takes the movie to a much higher level.  At last, the music fits with the story and the actions. A silent film is heavily dependent on it's music as well as facial espressions for setting the mood and telling the story. In the past versions I've seen I found the music to be a distraction. Bravo and thankyou to Franklyn Stover for finally setting it straight!
This version is also artisticly color tinted, adding mood and drama to intensify the scenes.
This is a must see classic! Funny and thrilling, artistic and thoughtful. Very creative camera work pulls you in and takes you on a fun ride. Packed with mystery, suspense and humor. A film you are sure to enjoy watching over and over.",1108598400,15,1022,4.554347826086956
993707,5,6305078947,"The Cat and the Canary (1927) is of interest not just from the historic perspective of expressionist film making, but also for just sheer fun.
This is not a movie for everyone. People who need special effects that leave nothing to the imagination, sound systems that capture every bullet casing hitting the floor or editing to hold those with short attention spans should not buy this movie. Well, they should, but they won't and they wouldn't enjoy it if they did.
For those who grew up watching Chiller Theater on Friday nights, this is a great movie to turn the lights down, prop the popcorn bowl on the knee, crack open a cold frosty and sit back for a pleasant evening.
The Cat and the Canary is just plain fun to watch. The hero doodling as the lawyer drones on is worth the price of the DVD alone. It's also amazing to see how silent actors and actresses can convey so much with a raised brow or a dimpled smile than many of today's Hollywood stars can with reams of scripts to read.
The Harold Lloyd short also is another pleasant haunted house comedy that develops at a leisurely pace like a stroll through a park that builds into a madcap dash.",1088467200,13,1154,4.44811320754717
993708,4,6305078947,"Ask some young film students or filmbuffs to name what they think are some of the most influential early films of cinema. Chances are you'll hear ""Birth of A Nation"", ""Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Citizen Kane"", but, I'd like to elect one more film to that list Paul Leni's ""The Cat and the Canary"".
 ""The Cat and the Canary"" originally started off as a Broadway play in 1922 and was made into (as far as I know) three films. The most famous being the 1939 adaptation starring Bob Hope. But this 1927 version just dazzles you with its techinal achievements. It has inspiring cinematography by Gilbert Warrenton and remarkable editing from Martin G. Cohn. There are plenty of shots I'm willing to bet were ahead of their time, mostly dealing with fade in's and out's.
 If you were to ask me, is this movie scary? I would have to answer no. ""The Cat and the Canary"" is just too dated to scare anyone. We've seen this far too many times for it to give us ""thrills and chills"", but, what makes this movie so entertaining to watch is it is an exercise in style and atmosphere. It is the cinematography and the mood the film creates that will capture your attention. This film set-up what we now refer to as ""haunted house"" movies.
 Paul Leni, for those who don't know is revered as one of the great German expressionist through such films as ""The Man Who Laughs"" and ""Waxworks"". And these three films are seen as the last of there kind.
 ""The Cat and the Canary"" as I said help establish what we now refer to as ""haunted house"" movies. The plot revolves around the death of Cyrus West, a millionair who's relatives hounded him like cats around a canary (hence the title). His will, as ordered by him, will be opened twenty years after his death. So a few of them show up to his dark eerie castle where legend has it is haunted by his spirit. The movie stars Laura La Plante as Annabelle West. She was very much in demand during the silent era and made some sound pictures including ""Show Boat"" and ""The King of Jazz"" (featuring Paul Whiteman). and Creighton Hale as Paul Jones (after you see his performance you'll understand perfectly why they remade it as a Bob Hope vehicle). He too was once popular but when sound came in, he was reduced to very small bit parts often going ""uncredited"". As you watch the movie you can expect every cliche attempt at horror you can think of. Some of which are still used today. Creepy hands appearing out of nowhere, the ""offbeat"" looking characters who you just suspect are evil and as mentioned before, that eerie atmosphere.
 Fans of silent films or even young film students I urge you to see this movie. You will be impressed.
 Bottom-line: As far as I'm concerned should be considered one of the most influential films of all-time due to its impressive cinematography and editing. An exercise in style and atmosphere that actually works.",1075507200,7,2871,4.554263565891473
993709,4,6305078947,"This silent film may rank high among those that are written about far more often than anybody ever sees them.  THE CAT AND THE CANARY is well worth the wait - in my case, it's been about 40 years between first reading a glowing account of the film and finally viewing it.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Of course, it requires a certain suspension of disbelief and I wondered why it was necessary to explain away everything as having a natural, and not supernatural, origin.  Still, the film is great fun - sort of like going to a Halloween party.
Paul Leni's expressionistic directing does wonders with the story although its stage origins are apparent.  Had Leni not died in 1929, I wonder what he might have done with DRACULA as early Universal publicity claimed he would direct it.
The DVD contains a great bonus of an early Harold Lloyd short, HAUNTED SPOOKS, from 1920.  Consistently inventive, this film is chilling on its own terms because Lloyd lost the thumb and index finger of his right hand during the filming.  He was posing for publicity photos and was holding a lighted but supposedly dud bomb.  It went off.  Despite his hospitalization and the obvious trauma he suffered, Lloyd was back at work on HAUNTED SPOOKS within a few weeks, wearing a flesh-colored glove on his right hand with a prosthetic thumb and finger.  It's interesting to compare footage that is clearly ""before and after"" based on how he uses his right hand.  This tragedy didn't stop Lloyd from making this film into a top comedy or from going on to be a star of feature films, enjoying a popularity that was second only to Charlie Chaplin.
