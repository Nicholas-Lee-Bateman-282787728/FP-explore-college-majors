5931643,3,B00EON8RHM,"In Twice Born (Venuto al mondo), an Italian-Spanish production, Penlope Cruz plays Gemma, a single mother living in Rome with a military officer Giuliano (Sergio Castellitto, who also directs). One day she receives a call from Gojco (Adnan Haskovic), one of her old friends in Sarajevo. Together with her sixteen-year-old son Pietro (Pietro Castellitto, real-world son of Sergio Castellitto), Gemma flies to the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where she lived as a college student more than twenty years ago.

Based on a book by Margaret Mazzantini (wife of Sergio Castellitto), Twice Born goes back and forth between the present and the past, following two storylines both involving Gemma, who falls in love with a young American photographer Diego (Emile Hirsch) just before the war begins.

Twice Born tries to mix melodramatic romance with tragedy of war, but the idea of a love story set against the backdrop of war-torn land simply does not work here, partly because what happened there is too vivid in our memories and shocking to be treated in this way. Beside the fact that the romance between Gemma and Diego lacks chemistry, Twice Born suffers from the uneven pace and some not-so-good performances from the cast.

The film is obviously well-intentioned, and benefits from the on-location photography that is not only authentic but often beautifully done, but Twice Born succeeds neither as a romance nor as a war drama.",1393545600,7,1439,5.114893617021276
5931644,1,B00EON8RHM,"The film took a great deal of time to get moving....to get going. The male lead was difficult to believe....while Penelope Cruz is a strong actor, the male lead fell short of being believable.",1390867200,4,192,4.676470588235294

5931647,5,B00EON8RHM,A truly thought provoking movie. I have never been a big fan of Ms. Cruz until now. Much more than just a pretty face.,1388793600,,118,3.9583333333333335
5931648,3,B00EON8RHM,A good movie and story. Just a bit long and some parts did not seem to flow together very well. All in all really liked the story.,1388707200,2,130,3.8518518518518516
5931649,4,B00EON8RHM,Excellent story. Captivates your heart and mind at the same time. This movie pulls you out of your own paradigm and challenges your thought.,1388188800,2,140,4.875
5931650,5,B00EON8RHM,"Margaret Mazzantinis very popular novel Venuto Al Mundo (English translation brought into the world) has been transformed into a screenplay by the author assisted by the director (her husband) Sergio Castellitto, the film in English is now called TWICE BORN. It is complex story, beautifully sculpted with interlocking flashbacks that cover a 30 year period, photographed with great skill by Gianfilippo Corticelli, and a cast that makes this carefully integrated story of varying timeframes work splendidly. Much of the films beauty is in the complexity of the manner in which the story develops and revealing too much of that story would spoil the experience for new viewers. Very basically the story relates a mother who brings her teenage son to Sarajevo, where his father died in the Bosnian conflict years ago. But more needs to be added.

Italian professor Gemma (Penlope Cruz) visits Sarajevo with her son, Pietro (Pietro Castellitto, son of the writer and director). The two of them had escaped the city sixteen years ago while the boys father, photographer Diego (Emile Hirsch) remained behind and later died during the Bosnian War. As she tries to repair her relationship with Pietro, Gemma is forced by revelations to face loss, the cost of war and the redemptive power of love. She re-acquaints with her dear friend Gojco (Adnan Haskovic) and together they relive the horrifying experiences of the war in Sarajevo, Gemmas attempt to provide her beloved Diego with a son (she is sterile), the eventual plan to have Diego use musician gypsy-type Aska (Saadet Aksoy) as a surrogate for the couples much desired child, and the consequences that plan takes on, leading to a series of identity crises that the now older Gemma must face with her teenaged son Pietro. The story is structured on alternate scenes from the trip taken in present in Bosnia by Gemma and her son and flashbacks from the two time periods (of the first encounter and the war), a technique that at times is difficult to follow but that definitely enhances the tension of the story.

The cast is extraordinary: Penelope Cruz is dazzling, Emile Hirsch gives his most sensitive performance of his career, and Adnan Haskovic, Saadet Aksoy and Luca da Filippo (as Gemmas father) are outstanding. This is a difficult film in message but a profoundly moving drama. Highly Recommended. In English, Italian, and Bosnian. Grady Harp, December 13",1386806400,10,2415,5.050125313283208

5931652,3,B00EON8RHM,"Artistic, at times confusing, melodrama with wartime background. Hard to hang on to plot line until more clarity is given in the last 30 minutes; yet, the story became meaningful in the end. More abstract than direct storytelling. Viewers must piece the plot together as the director bounces around varied scenes and images, music, and moments with dialogue between characters that doesn't always make sense. Overall, not bad but not great -- ultimately redeemed by twist in the storyline.",1386633600,6,489,5.2025316455696204

Emile Hirsh was magnificent in this movie.  There are a lot of scenes that cut back to a younger time and then back to the present time, so don't get confused.",1416700800,,307,4.446428571428571

5931665,5,B00EON8RHM,"I read the synopsis, but honestly, none of the official plot summaries do this movie justice.  I was on the fence about even watching it, but 30 minutes in, I couldn't stop watching it.  I do agree that the directing did create more of a melodrama than was necessary in this riveting story, but overall I loved it.  The acting was marvelous from all players.  Frankly, and to be a little shallow, I'd have preferred someone better-looking than the director's son to have played Pietro, but he played the part well.

Be forewarned, this movie is not for everyone.  I would definitely put it in the chick-flick category... it is a love story set against the backdrop of war in the former Yugoslavia.  It truly does bring the war to you in the perspective of the atrocities that were committed in ""modern times"".  A time most of us can remember.  However, the point of the movie isn't about the war but rather different kinds of love and relationships.  It is slow in parts but catastrophically moving, even when it's slow.  I can liken this movie to a French tragedy and I definitely loved it in the same way.  It does not have a particularly happy ending, but rather offers closure for the characters involved.

The only negative that I have to offer is that in trying to maintain the mystery of certain events, it was difficult to figure out what was happening at times -- or rather what caused certain events.

If you like Dr Zhivago, Anna Karenina, The Count of Monte Cristo, and that genre, I think you will definitely enjoy this movie... Now I'm off to read the book!",1404259200,5,1571,4.544483985765124

5931667,1,B00EON8RHM,Boring.  Terrible acting.  Poor script.  Switches from English to foreign language in same scene w/o reason.  Plot drags and could easily have been less than two hours.  Pair is laughable together and Cruz is a terrible actress.,1402012800,,228,5.054054054054054

5931671,5,B00EON8RHM,"I loved this movie. I'm a big Penelope Cruz fan, but this movie kept me thinking a couple days after I watched it. Thats how I can tell if a movie was good. If I am still thinking about it days after I had watched it, it was a good flick. I plan on watching it again. Wonderful lovestory of how far you would go to protect someone you loved and stay honorable to yourself. Some thought this movie was drawn out but you needed to see the details of the sceens to fully understasnd what is going on. They actually did shorten this film some but if they would have shortened it anymore it would have ruined it. No one would have understood it. I loved it.",1395792000,5,652,4.1015625
