I watched it while it was available to stream on N*tflix.
It is a silly romantic comedy about an adorable young (18 to 2X) girl who has a history of ""crazy"" in her family.
She eventually decides she is a cyborg/robot/android and is committed to a psychiatric ward,
were she has some pretty funny adventures and finds  friendship and maybe more.

I believe it is directed by the same director of Sympathy for Mr Vengeance or was it Oldboy?
Either way if you go in expecting any of what is in those films you will be disappointed.
If you go in expecting a funny, sweet and sometimes sad film about those whose minds don't quite
fit in to what we consider normal...you may be pleasantly satisfied...lol",1468281600,,777,4.50354609929078
