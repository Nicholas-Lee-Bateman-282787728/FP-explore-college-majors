4844578,5,B005N8KPBS,"I really loved this mini series.  It is split into two parts, both of which are about 90 minutes long.

The first half is more focused on the 1950's era when Betty (the main character) has her affair with Craze, her Polish neighbor.  And the second half is about Betty thirty years later on her son's wedding day.

My favorite part was the first part when you really get to see the affair and how much in love with Craze, Betty becomes.  I could really feel just how much she longed/wanted to be with him and while I don't agree with affairs I was finding myself hoping that the two could find a way to be together.

The second part was good as well, though it is very different from the first.  It's thirty years later and we see what her life is like with her husband and son.  Set mostly during her son's wedding day, Betty keeps seeing hallucinations of Craze throughout the day.  Let's just say the ending had me in tears, happy tears.

The two parts could really be seen as different movies all together as they don't really center in on the same thing.  Part one was certainly my favorite but two has its moments as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who love's period dramas.",1365465600,8,1198,4.351351351351352

4844583,5,B005N8KPBS,"I can only agree with the glowing reviews here. I've recently become an ardent fan of Divergent hottie Theo James and got this movie because of him and, of course, I'm a sucker for romance.

This wonderful two-part series definitely met my expectations--especially the steamy and passionate scenes between Billie Piper and Theo. Another fan favorite Alun Armstrong had me cracking up throughout the second part. Sue Johnston was so good. It was a well-cast and a poignant love story indeed! I highly recommend!

Btw...Theo is a solid actor and I hope he gets more romantic roles in the future, because he's so great as a leading man ;)",1420848000,3,635,4.81651376146789
