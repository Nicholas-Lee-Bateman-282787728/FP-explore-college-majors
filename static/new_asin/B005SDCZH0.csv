4878695,5,B005SDCZH0,"Just finished watching RED DOG!  Amazing performance by the dog character - great eye expressions!  The dog is very amusing and holds your interest throughout the movie.  And no animal movie goes unfinished without pulling on your heartstrings.  This was a very entertaining movie.  Do not let the first 10 minutes put you off - takes a little getting used to the characters - but once you do, you will not regret it.  Loved it!",1348012800,78,428,4.64

4878697,5,B005SDCZH0,"A wonderful story.
Not only about dog loyalty, but a terrific insight into the Australian outback.
A little fanciful where red dog was concerned but still terrific",1346198400,,163,5.074074074074074
4878698,1,B005SDCZH0,"I guess I had a few expectations that this would be up there with the great Aussie classic movies ""The Dish"",  ""The Castle"", and ""CrackerJack"".
 Sadly this film falls way short in both storyline and acting ability, with a few minor exceptions.
The story took multiple turns into comedy, drama and a pathetic, shallow attempt at romance. The 2 characters involved in a romance were not at all likeable, and **SPOILER** when 1 of them dies, there was no sense of loss or sadness...almost relief. The female lead was annoying, frosty and very unlikeable. She reminded me a lot of Nicole Kidman in the flop movie Australia.
I was bored for a lot of the time, and I don't easily get bored watching movies. The scenes were often too long, involving montage upon montage, monotonous cliches, and pointless speeches.
To be based upon a real story there must  be a sense of reality, but this seldom surfaced. It went from boring to bad in less than 25 minutes.
I think the only scenes I could say were well acted and directed were several starring the Italian. So my 1 star is for him...Bravo!",1341273600,2,1084,4.606217616580311
4878699,5,B005SDCZH0,"""Red Dog"" is the story of an Australian cattle dog that bonds a mining community, which is based on true events.

It is the dog's people skills and sense of adventure that is the essence of the narrative.

Red Dog interacts individually with various members of the transient townships of Dampier, Western Australia, but also creates a collective experience for the community by bringing people together in many different situations. This includes helping romances grow and giving some people who were aimless a sense of belonging.

Whilst Red Dog is always unselfish and has a strong veneer he experiences his own loss that causing him to wander to find himself.

It is a warm account of people from all walks of life and a dog that becomes their dear friend.

4878700,5,B005SDCZH0,"I watched this movie in an historic theater in Broome, Australia and I have been trying to get it in American format ever since so I can have it at home.  I know it was full of Australian humor that I probably didn't understand, but the story and characters are so real and Red Dog is so special, this is truly a top pick of movies for me. I watched it again on the flight home.  How can I get the distributors to make it available in the US?",1335225600,13,442,3.955056179775281
4878701,5,B005SDCZH0,"I am not a huge dog movie fan so I put off watching this movie for a while, however, I have to say this is an excellent movie!  I was very surprised by this.  I am also from an iron mining area so that was a nice touch as well.

ok, what else to say?

This is a heartwarming drama that can be sad, very funny, and a bit quirky at time with a great soundtrack.  This movie is based on true stories about a real dog.  It isn't just about a dog, it is about the people too, but the dog is the star.

The big animal movie everyone was talking about was 'War Horse.'  In my opinion this blows warhorse away....much different movie but I enjoyed this one MUCH more.

Most will laugh and will also be inspired...and a bit in awe of this amazing dog...many of you will cry, but I think almost everyone will love this movie.  Your whole family can watch this movie.

This is an Australian movie and won best picture in Australia.",1333756800,29,920,4.083798882681564

4878810,3,B005SDCZH0,"This 2011 film has won multiple awards, and it's not hard to see why it is so popular among Australians in particular. Set in 1971, it begins with a truck driver arriving in a Dampier pub, where he stumbles upon a dying dog named Red Dog.  This becomes a plot device for the pub patrons to describe various events in the life of the famous dog, with extended flashbacks completing different narratives.  Red Dog had many friends in the mining town, an American named John Grant being one he was particularly fond of.  But after a tragedy happens, Red Dog starts to travel the Pilbara.  The overall plot loosely describes the apparently true story of Red Dog, who is honoured in real life with a statue just outside Dampier.

The film is intended to be more comedic than historically accurate, with many moments of amusement.  Clearly the film makers had great fun depicting the world of the early 1970s and rural Australian life, and aren't afraid to show humorous sterotypes.  There are some great characters, some wonderful cinematography, and some typical Australianism - many Aussies will enjoy having a laugh at themselves, and the stereotypical personas of a mining town from the 1970s.  A love story is a minor plot element (which includes some implied promiscuity), but the main hero is Red Dog himself.  I found the use of different flashbacks somewhat disruptive and this disturbed the narrative somewhat, but aside from that it's a fairly decent, although not stellar film. - GODLY GADFLY (April 2017)",1492819200,,1512,4.875

4878858,5,B005SDCZH0,"Once upon a time there was a Black and Tan Kelpie named Delilah. Growing up she lived at my buddy's house, where we hung out and threw parties, and she became friends with dozens of people in the community, receiving adoration from all walks of life as more than a dog, but a four-legged human and friend. The woman who primarily cared for her passed away, and she bounced around to various homes with various people she had befriended, including family members and friends who grew up with her. Circumstances grew troubling for her, and I was tasked with finding her a new home. She didn't want any other home than beside me, and we became inseparable. I took her to work when I could, and on camping trips, kayaking adventures, road trips, and even daily errands. After a few years she passed at 14 years old, this past October. It was devastating to me, and to all her friends throughout the community. When I took her in, I had never even heard of a Kelpie, as they're rare in my neck of the woods, and most books don't have so much as a footnote on the breed in the US. Well, now the whole town knows of the breed, and has nothing but fondness for it. I heard about this film and just had to watch it, so I ordered it from Amazon and watched it last night. It was a fantastic family tear jerker, that made me miss my gal Delilah even more. She was no legend like Red Dog, but the similarities made me proud to have known her. If you love four-legged companions, or just enjoy Australian films, this is a must-own. Cheap and shipped quickly, and great special features, I highly recommend this DVD.",1483488000,13,1602,4.361204013377926

4879056,1,B005SDCZH0,"Wish I would have read the 1 star reviews before I purchased this movie.  I thought it was terrible!  We love dogs, but this movie came so far short of for instance ""Hachi - A Dog's Tale""- which we absolutely loved.  As one reviewer said had trouble with the ""accents"" Australian and Italian and so did I - but the love story was so weak and the dog scenes not enough - not like in Hachi. Ugh!",1451001600,2,393,4.077922077922078

4879058,5,B005SDCZH0,I enjoyed this movie very much. The movie shows that animals are much smarter than we give them credit for. The true sense of loyalty and love. I think this movie should be shown to kids and maybe more empathy will be shown towards our animals as they become adults.,1449187200,,266,4.34

I'm a dog lover, and happen to live with an aging Kelpie, so it hits close to home.

Based on the legendary true story of the Red Dog who united a disparate local mining community while roaming the Australian outback in search of his long lost master, the movie is very funny but also heartbreaking (do have a box of tissues on hand when you watch it). The star of the movie, Coco, received multiple ""acting"" awards, including the U.S. Golden Collar Award for Best Achievement in Film. Sadly, this was his only movie: only a year after the film was released, Coco passed away at the age of 8 due to a previously undiagnosed heart condition, but in his short life he has touched the lives of so many. Formerly a shelter dog, discovered and adopted by the movie's director Nelson Voss, he became the ambassador for the Humane Society of Australia and visited many communities promoting adoption of shelter animals.",1404259200,5,873,4.675324675324675

The film is well written (based on a book of the same name) and well edited.  There's plenty of laughter but there are tears as well.

4879424,5,B005SDCZH0,"Wonderfully rich and unusual characters,  Red Dog was very believable as a character, and well portrayed. This is probably one of the most moving movies I have seen in very many years. The exceptional cinematography not only captures the nuances of a complex canine character role, but captures the starkly naked and dry landscape of Western Australia.

Yet, Red Dog overwhelmingly surmounts the drag coefficient of Hollywood Kitsch. Red Dog delivers a memorable & deeply moving story that I plan to revisit many times in my life and share with my dearest friends.

Red Dog is the stuff of Myth, Legend, and Lore.

The only negative comment relates to how Hollywood's limitations. They do seem compelled to mar wonderful productions with Kitsch. Why is there always a ""hunk American man"", and some unrealistically attractive female lead, and the two always must hit it off.",1374537600,2,873,5.041666666666667

4879444,5,B005SDCZH0,"If you have not seen this movie than you have to or you will regret it if you do not. This is a true story about an incredible dog that brought happiness and love into people's lives. He was a famous dog around Australia. Everyone knew him. It is a bittersweet story. It will put a smile on your face, but also it will put tears in your eyes. I am so glad I viewed this movie as it shows how much our furry kids can bring such abundance of joy into our lives. I cannot understand the negative reviews on Amazon about this movie. The negative reviewers just do not get it. It is not about romance as one negative viewer said it was suppose to be or should have been. It was about Red Dog telling us how intelligent our canine friends are, how Red Dog brought people together, and how people cared for Red Dog. Red Dog did not have one master, but many cared for him  until he found his true master 'Johnny Boy or John'. Red Dog traveled all over Australia looking for his only true master after his true master left and I won't say anything more about his master as you need to watch the movie to find out why Red Dog was searching for John. As said in the movie by Vanno(character/acting name), 'Sometimes you pick your dog and sometimes your dog picks you"". Red Dog did pick his true master. Prior to finding his true master everyone in this small town of Dampier, AU loved and cared for Red Dog. He even became part of their union where they worked for the Hamersley Iron Mining Company. Yes, this is all truth. As I say again, it is a true story. As said in the movie, ""He is a smart pooch"" and how true that statement is. Red Dog even had a fund at the town bank so that if he needed food or medical care they then would have the funds to help him. Red Dog had a loyal Veterinarian who took such good care of Red Dog when he needed it. Red Dog went through a severe grieving process after his true master was gone. Again, I will not say what happened to John (his master) as you need to watch the movie. I will try not to say anymore as it could spoil it for those who have not viewed the movie. I watched this movie on TV, and bought the movie ASAP. I knew it was not a waste of money. I still watch it repeatedly. The ending is so sweet when the town dedicates a statue in honor of Red Dog, which was erected outside the town of Dampier and is still there to this day and always will be. There was also a Red Dog puppies at the end of the movie. This movie also reminds me of the movie Hachi with Richard Gere, which is another touching movie that should be viewed by all. The only difference between Red Dog and Hachi I found was that Red Dog had a much stronger character. Red Dog had a sense of humor about him and yet a serious side. Red Dog will make you laugh at times. Oh, I must not forget to mention Red Cat who was Red Dog's rival at the start of the movie. Red Cat was a bad bad dude and Red Dog had to contend with him, but it was funny. This movie also reminds me of my American Eskimo who passed on a few weeks after she and I watched Red Dog together. I now have a new American Eskimo puppy, so it rather reminds me of the Red Dog story, as there were new Red Dog pups at the end of the movie. Again I say, just do not take my word for it. You must watch this movie. It will pull at those heartstrings. Have lots of facial tissue nearby, as you will need it. From my hours of research about Red Dog, some say seeing the movie has changed their lives for the positive and I believe it. It surely changed my life and I have been a dog lover and owner since I can remember and I am now 53-years old. However, I learned more things about our furry kids from this movie. How much they really love us unconditionally, they go all out to help us, and give us companionship. Koko who played Red Dog was an excellent actor. The true Red Dog passed away in 1979. Sadly, Koko passed on in late 2012. Koko has a Red Dog screen test on 'You Tube' that will tickle you. Just type in 'Koko's RED DOG Screen Test' or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Su66nlzKC0, you can see him in action and how intelligent Koko was. Make sure you watch Koko's expression at the end of the video when the director tells Koko he has to have his hair dyed red because he is a Red Dog meaning he got the part after his interview with the director. Watch and you will melt at his cute little precious face. A very intelligent guy Koko was. I am sure his owner/producer of the movie misses Koko a great deal.
Red Dog was a very strong dog to go through all the things he did and he never gave up hope. That is something we all can learn from is to not give up hope. I just do not know what else to say as the movie is that excellent. The movie won rave reviews in Australia and they only started out with an 8 million dollar budget. The movie grossed over 21 million dollars at the box office in just Australia alone. The actors Josh Luccas, Rachel Taylor, and all were wonderful with Koko and their acting. Koko and the producer of the movie became so attached while making the movie that the producer became Koko's true owner. All I can say it please watch it!

4879446,5,B005SDCZH0,"Red Dog is a heartwarming and true story of a Kelpie/Cattle dog who lived in the town of Dampier in the Pilbara region of Australia in the 1970's.  This takes place during a time when life was free but hard and men came from all over the world to work in the iron ore fields of NW Australia to make money.  The towns people convey their stories of how Red Dog effected each of their lives.  He had no master, yet he was every man's dog until one day he found his true master, John Stazzonelli.  However, this was to be short lived and the story takes you following Red Dog as he goes looking for John.  This is how Red Dog got his reputation as the Pilbara Wanderer and known all over Australia.  It was even rumored that Red Dog visited Japan.
The story made me laugh and cry.  The people of Dampier loved Red Dog so much and felt that he represented the spirit of that area and of that era that after his passing in 1979, they erected a statue to him that can be seen as you enter the town.

The dog was beautiful and Josh Lucas was great in this. Besides the dog I thought they had some likeable characters. It had some funny scenes but one scene involving Red dog and a cat I didn't like that much because it was kinda kidish and not very realistic involving some CGI/special effects. It reminded me of the movie Cats & Dogs. I thought they could have left that part out. Yes,this movie was sad but not as sad as Old Yeller like some people say.

4879459,5,B005SDCZH0,"I bought this film for my 89 yr. old mother who is staying with us and loves animals.  When we started watching I had moderate expectations but I knew she was looking forward to it so I continued with an open mind.  I am so glad I did.  This film is funny, poignant and creatively written and directed.  The cinematography is also wonderful.

This film is based on a true stroy about a dog named RED DOG who becomes famous all over Western Australia in the 1970's.  To tell you how or why he was so famous would give away a huge part of the story.  The story is uniquely told by different members of a mining town in Western Australia, each having their own special encounter and relationship with RED DOG.

The film has an authentic Australian flavor to it. The people are hardworking and have tough exteriors but inside they all have a soft spot for RED DOG.  The dog itself is lovely Australian Larrikan breed.  It has haunting eyes and a stubborn personality that fits right into the surroundings.

I have to say the best part of this film is that it is a great family film, one that, no matter what age you are, you will fall in love with RED DOG, RED CAT and the crew that works the mines.

It has everything in it for the dog lover in all of us, plus a good dose of Australian outback scenery, blue-collar values and romance too.  Just be prepared for some tear-jerker moments, as this is based on a true story and the price of life and joy is death and heartache.  I am so moved by this movie, I'm in the process right now of ordering my Blu-Ray combo so I can give the DVD away as a present and keep the Blu-Ray to enjoy the HD scenery.  And by the way, the star of the movie is Koko, who sadly passed away in December 2012, only a year after this movie was completed.

4879492,5,B005SDCZH0,"My wife and I put off watching this movie for a while--big mistake--this is a really good movie.  Red Dog is the star and scene stealer, and the other characters add and hold interest as well.  If there is a fault with this movie it's the fight scenes between Red Dog and the cat which belongs to the villainous camper park manager and his wife--they seem like something out of looney tunes--kind of tasmanian devilish--but then again who wants to see a real dog and cat fight ( I saw one in real life once and the cat was dead in about 5 seconds-before I could even break it up)
There are many comical moments in this movie and a few really sad ones--but all in all a movie that is entertaining from beginning to end--though as some have noted--the first few minutes before you know the characters or storyline don't seem real thrilling.  It's hard for me to say this movie has a ""happy"" ending--but not wanting to post a spoiler there's not much of a way to comment on it

I gave a copy to a couple of bikers from AUSTRALIA, and they recommended this movie. It has not been distributed in USA theaters yet. TOO BAD, it is a winner. It does not go into the sentimentality and sad ending of most dog stories, because Red Dog is a true story about a community loved stray who has become a legend in Western Austalia. It is a wonderful telling of frontier life in a blue collar town and the Dog that brought them together.
I further recommend the book, Merles Door by Ted Kerosote, a book that explains the benefit of listening to the wisdom of your own dog. It too is a five star performence and worthy of being on the big screen.",1351900800,,795,4.2026143790849675

4879575,5,B005SDCZH0,"I just finished viewing the film as a rental on Netflix. Now I'm putting in an order here at Amazon for numerous copies to give as Christmas Gifts - the film is THAT exceptional. Based on true events folks, and of course there probably have been some changes made to make the film version more 'palatable' for the masses. But at the heart of the story are the very true emotions of an American man in remote 1971 Austraila who didn't choose the dog - the dog chose him. And everyone who came into the life of this dog in one way or another is touched forever, as you will be too. To be sure, there is a great deal of comedy, and very broad comedy at that. But it's very effective. Children will laugh at certain events and Adults will laugh at events the children won't probably get. Everyone will be pleased with this film. Still, with all the comedy, there is this very real dramatic vein that runs throughout, mostly from the half-way mark to the end that will enable Adults to be carried along. And let me tell you this, there will not be a dry-eye in your living room at film's end. Even now while I'm writing this and thinking back on this passage in the film, I am tearing up: 'Have YOU seen John?', 'Have YOU seen John?'.

I'm a 62 year old ex-marine and I still get a little teary eyed with I see that that movie.

What I'm getting to is this:  If you like ""Old Yeller"" then you will love this movie.  It's one of those movies that will make you laugh and cry  and then laugh again.  Not sure if this flick will be an instant classic but it will one that I will watch more than once.",1349568000,71,556,4.045871559633028
4879577,4,B005SDCZH0,"I had no idea what to expect (other than anticipating the typical ""dog movie"" genre), so I was pleased that it gave me something a little different. The box will lead you to believe it is a romantic comedy for dog lovers, and yeah, it's a little bit of that, but the romance is not the major focus of this film.

Like another reviewer said, don't let the beginning throw you off. It takes a little while to warm up to. It's a low budget Australian film that takes place in a dirty, arid mining town in Australia populated almost entirely by dirty, unattractive men, and a dog. Sorry dog fans, but even the canine star is kind of homely and is not really called upon to do any heavy duty doggie acting. In fact, nothing in this film is attractive (well, okay, Rachael Taylor is gorgeous).

For a modern, family-friendly film, the pacing is a bit slow, and the filmmaker loves to suddenly freeze-frame and throw up a caption describing the character being shown... a technique that is very off-putting to me and I was about to write off the movie after the first 15 minutes, and yet, despite what's starting to sound like a negative review, the movie works for me. As you get to know the miners and their quirky back stories (all related to Red Dog in some way) you start to pick up on an inner beauty to the story that really left me thinking about it the next day... a very good sign.

This movie is suitable for all ages. A couple of bits of crude phrases (hardly worth mentioning) and apparently the couple spends the night together (not shown) on the first date, but I would have no problem sharing this with children - although they may find it a little slow as the ""magic"" of the story might be lost on them.

I myself am not a huge dog fanatic, and would never recommend a film based purely on the presence of a canine character, but if you are fond of independent movies, dog-stories, or quirky characters, I would recommend this film. I have to agree with the previous reviewer that ""Hachi"" is a little more polished and heart-wrenching than Red Dog, but what's fun is that Red Dog is a very similar story told in a very different way, and with more eccentric characters. There should be room on your DVD shelf for both.
