7153789,5,B00WTAT0MI,"My collection is now complete.

SHOUT Factory if you see this. Never pull a stunt like this again on Saban fans. These 17 episodes are some of the best ones in the Metallix series.

For all you Saban fans out there these are the only 2 ways to have saved VR Troopers and Beetleborgs Metallix.

VR Troopers - acquire the footage of Uchuu Keiji Gavan to upgrade Kaitlin and use the footage of Uchuu Keiji Sharivan to upgrade JB say 3 or 4 episodes after Ryan got his new suit. Then the 39 episodes series 2 of VR Troopers is then 60 giving us a finale to thrash Grim Lord. Say a 4 or 5 part finale, then they choose to keep their powers in case any villainous forces return.

Beetleborgs Metallix - A 90 minute to 100 minute movie either for the cinematic screen or TV screen where Les Fortunes redeems himself in becoming a goodie where he helps the Beetleborgs to return Nukus, Horribelle and Vilor to 2D and he joins his brother Arthur at the end. The kids then keep their powers. Say in Power Rangers Turbo there is a 3 episode crossover.",1433462400,2,1040,4.290816326530612

8714167,5,B00WTAT0MI,"Finally! My Beetleborgs collection is complete! I can't believe Saban and Shout! Factory made us all wait so long to get the second part of Season Two on DVD. They should have never made us wait so long to get the complete collection of such a great series. Anyway, I'm ecstatic that I have all the Beetleborgs episodes! Now, I can finally see what happened in the rest of season 2. Highly recommended for any Beetleborgs and Power Rangers fans!",1441324800,,445,4.575
8714168,3,B00WTAT0MI,"The show really dropped out of quality this season.  The actual Beetleborgs actually fell to 2nd story line for the most part behind the mansion monsters.  Still nice to complete the collection with, but not as good as the first season.",1438041600,,236,4.7317073170731705
