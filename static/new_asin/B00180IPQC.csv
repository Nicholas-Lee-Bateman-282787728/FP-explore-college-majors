3176579,5,B00180IPQC,I bought Robbie Coltranes Incredible Britian video and it is worth every penny. Very funny and the tour he takes you on is awesome. I learned so much and was totally humored along the way. I borrowed it originally from the library and loved it so much I ordered a copy for myself from Amazon.,1281052800,5,292,4.327272727272727

8268144,5,B00180IPQC,"Outstanding!  I am a Robbie Coltrane fan since watching Cracker. His touring of the ""B"" roads of Great Britain with all the stops and interesting activities was delightful. I wish that he would make additional touring DVD's. No doubt i will watch this many times.",1489276800,,263,4.844444444444444

8268148,4,B00180IPQC,"This 3-segment program is a wonderful excursion through the British countryside, with host Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter's Hagrid, and star of numerous Brit TV programs including Cracker) stopping in to experience a variety of things including stone cutting for a stately country home. While I would have preferred more of the town and country views (what is shown is wonderful), the combination of elements combined with Coltrane's non-fussy presentation makes this engaging and enjoyable viewing.",1392076800,,498,5.653333333333333
8268149,5,B00180IPQC,"I watch this all the time. Way better than the typical travel show where you see all the ""normal"" things in the UK.. Mr. Coltrane is a very personable fellow and I thoroughly enjoyed his ""chats"" with the viewers about the things he's seeing and doing.",1357257600,3,251,4.478260869565218
8268150,5,B00180IPQC,"This series is amazing. The actor who plays hagrid in Harry potter is actually a comedian - a real one - meaning he is hilarious. He travels through Britain to check out the bizarre festivals and such that take place.  He drives a classic car and his smoky, gravely voice is memorizing.  Wish there were more!!!",1328832000,3,311,4.535714285714286
8268151,4,B00180IPQC,"This was very entertaining and I enjoyed it.  I was a little disappointed that more time was not spent in my own part of the country, Co. Durham.",1316649600,2,145,4.178571428571429
