8056076,4,B0008F5TC6,"These are transfers from the famous TV series. The video is a bit grainy perhaps due to the source material age. If you enojoyed this series as a child seeing as an adult is illuminating. Much of the drama is created by effects, but part of the fun is catching the overdubs and trock photography that you missed as a child. 4 stars due to the grainy video",1496534400,,355,4.235294117647059

8056082,5,B0008F5TC6,"I first checked this out at the library. At first I thought my son would be bored with the music and photography, considering that it was done decades ago, but he was entranced with them. So he was thrilled when we bought this set. For animal lovers, who like Marlin Perkin's personality, get it. It's a change from Steve Irwin's style.",1168300800,3,336,4.524590163934426
