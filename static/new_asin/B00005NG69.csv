1633496,5,B00005NG69,"The closing of the Macross Saga is phenomenal. I have been very impressed, thus far with the three sets. You even get what was released for Robotech II, the Sentinels. If you are an anime fan, Robotech is what started it all.",1001116800,,225,4.380952380952381
1633497,5,B00005NG69,"This box set contains the following. Robotech Vol. 5, Robotech Vol. 6 and Robotech Extra Disc 3. Since the first two discs can be bought seperately, my review will be on the extra disc.
This disc is focused on the Harmony Gold\Tatsuko studio's sequel to Robotech right after the Macross Saga ends called The Sentinals. Unlike Codename Robotech, the video quality here was extremely well. The audio commentary by Carl Macek is sadly a text he read from one of his books explaining the Sentinels. The rest of the extras center around the Sentinals. Inluding bios on all characters, mecha design sheets, character models and promotional film with additional footage. The only extra that seperates itself from the Sentinals is the two International Clips which both feature Minmei.
The Sentinals is the story of the surviving crew from Macross along with new ones that build the SDF-3 to establish piece negotiations with the Robotech Masters. While Rick contemplates getting married to Lisa, the Robotech Master's people are having some trouble when the Invid come searching for the Flower of Life.
Overall, great episodes, great extras, how can you argue? A must have for any anime fan.
Note: Look for an Astro Boy and Godzilla toy box in Episode 35.",1001030400,,1248,4.976076555023924
1633498,4,B00005NG69,"Of all 7 volumes of the Robotech DVD box sets, this is the one to get. It includes episodes 25-36 of the Macross Saga, which covers some of the grandest moments of the Robotech saga. Included here are the destruction and rebirth of Earth, the Sterling wedding, Lisa and Rick finally falling in love, and a lot more. Here is a summary of the episodes:
25: Wedding Bells: The alien fighter ace Miriya Parino meets her match in human Max Sterling. Since she can't kill him, she does the next best thing...Marries him!
26: The Messenger: With the destruction of Earth nearing, a group of aliens (Zentraedi) form an alliance with Earth to prevent their own destruction.
27: Force Of Arms: The Earth is devastated in a horrifying attack.
28: Reconstruction Blues: Two years after the global holocaust, Earth is being rebuilt. All is not peaceful, however, and old conflicts threaten to flare up again.
29: Robotech Masters: The Zentraedi living on Earth continue to grow disillusioned as the Robotech Masters leave their homeworld to head for Earth...and battle with the humans!
30: Viva Miriya: Our heroes attack the last enemy weapons factory with their secret weapon...a baby????!!!!
31: Khyron's Revenge: The renegade alien warlord Khyron attacks a peaceful city.
32: Broken Heart: Khyron holds singing star Lynn Minmei hostage.
33: A Rainy Night: Claudia Grant and Lisa Hayes discuss loves lost and still to come.
34: Private Time: Rick abandons Lisa for a date with that sniveling pop star, Lynn Minmei.
35: Season's Greetings: Khyron the alien warlord attacks Macross City in a quest to destroy as many humans as possible.
36: To The Stars: Our heroes must stop Khyron's attack, but some of them will pay the ultimate price while the rest are changed forever.
These episodes include some of the high points of the series, and represented here are all of the facets that made Robotech such a splendid Sci-Fi experience. Space battles, cheesy pop songs, introspective moments of philosophizing...it's all here. This really is the best segment of the Robotech series.
Also included on the bonus DVD is the OAV sequel ""The Sentinels"", which follows Rick, Lisa, Miriya and the rest as they set out to make peace with the Robotech Masters but end up fighting the most ruthless enemy of all, the Invid. This action-oriented follow-up was never completed, but the first six episodes were edited together into this smashing sequel. ""The Sentinels"" will not be available anywhere other than this box set, so this really is the one to get.
A few words of caution: The sound for Robotech was recorded only in mono, so that's what we get on this DVD. Also, the video transfer is a bit grainy. The quality is at least as good as the aired versions or the VHS tapes released earlier, but has not been cleaned up a whole lot for the DVD. For these two reasons only I gave this DVD box set 4 stars instead of 5. Still, I loved it and will watch it over and over.",999648000,18,2946,4.755859375
1633499,5,B00005NG69,"If you like anime, and want one that is everything the japanese production created plus an american twist (best for beginner anime fans) than this is the one for you, the macross saga is awesome, I loved it as a child on tv, now on dvd I can relive those memories and give people new ones like mine. be sure to get the other collections as well.",995587200,5,345,4.164179104477612
1633500,4,B00005NG69,"I just got Robotech legacy #3 and it's everything I expected and more. Makes me wish I was 16 again. In this age of Cartoon Network and MTV,  ""anything goes"" but it's dissapointing how now more than ever, animation producers and writers are sticking to formula. Either that or they're jumping on ""imitating the lastest hot anime"" bandwagon. Call Carl Macek a butcher if you want but he had a good idea during a time when experimentation was actually encouraged. And it was an experiment that worked
The only thing I really am dissapointed about is some of the extras on the Sentinels tapes. The character bios, for example should have had extra screens. They covered Rick, Lisa and all the old carryover characters from Macross saga as expected as well as some of the new ones like Cabell and Rem, but they left out a lot of the new characters. Most notable are missing bios for important characters such as Dr. Lang, T.R. Edwards, Vince and Jean Grant, the Regent and Regiss, Tesla, and the Sentinels themselves.
The Sentinels audio commentary by Carl Macek was really nothing more than his ""dry"" reading of his Robotech Art 3 book. The first 4 chapters anyway. Mostly verbatim. Interesting but I thought a traditional running commentary on the video itself would have been more interesting as there was a plenthora of interesting stuff to analyze and discuss. The book material could have been an additional documentary style extra in and of itself. Better yet, why not just reprint the book for those who didn't get to buy it. There's probably money in it.
The oldest part of my almost 20 year old video collection is the Robotech episodes that I taped off TV back in 85-86. Unfortunately, on today's VCRs and TVs, they look really crappy. And I'm glad I've got Robotech Legacy's DVDs so I can retire those tapes (20 year old videotapes will die an ignoble death in 2003 VCRs after too long, so if you taped these shows off TV, get Robotech Legacy and let your old VHS tapes rest in peace.",1051228800,,1992,4.643059490084986
1633501,5,B00005NG69,"Robotech has always been in my life. I don't remember ever watching Bert and Ernie or Mr. Rogers or anything like that as a child--I would just vaguely remember Lynn Minmei in her red Chinese dress. As a middle schooler, I thought I would grow up to be like Miriya and become an ace fighter pilot (Ha!). It's funny how things change, but now, as a college student, I appreciate not only the whole story but the love triangle in the story--especially Minmei, who always came across as an annoying little... But having experienced a love triangle of my own, I have come to sympathize (sp?) with her.
Anyway, the Robotech series is a classic that everyone should experience watching (even if you're like me and don't like Japanimation--Robotech is different!). These particular DVD's sadly bring the conclusion of one of the greatest stories of all time. Why is the story so great? Well, there's action, drama, comedy, romance, etc. There is also a great number of characters that the viewers come to care about, and each of them, with their own uniqueness, contribute to the greatness of the Macross story. The main character is Rick Hunter, who follows the footsteps of his best friend Roy Fokker and joins the Robotech forces against the 40 feet tall alien Zentradai that have come for the SDF-1 (a huge alien ship that the humans have transformed for their own protection). Rick Hunter falls in love with Lynn Minmei, who later becomes a famous entertainer, and forms a strong relationship with his commanding officer Lisa Hayes throughout the series. And then there is Max Sterling, the modest ace pilot of the SDF-1, who constantly out-manuevers Miriya, the Zentradai ace pilot of the elite Quadrono Squadron. (My favorite episode is ""Farewell Big Brother"" when they first combat each other).
I also commend the writers of Robotech for having such strong female characters, like Claudia, who is a solid rock to all around her.
Although the Sentinels return to some of the old Macross characters with new and interesting ones, I don't think it's as good as Macross. So it makes me sad everytime I watch the very last scene of Macross and hear Minmei's song bringing it all to a close...
""...a world of things we've never seen before
where silver suns have golden moons
each year has thirteen Junes
that's what must be for me
to be in love...""",1033171200,3,2344,4.775862068965517
1633502,5,B00005NG69,"I'll have to admit being a bit biased here since I ordered all 3 Macross boxed sets at once.  After watching the first 2 boxes the last still managed to come up with a surprise for me. Ofcourse it features the last episodes of the Macross saga, but the bonus DVD is also worth some attention IMO... Ever heard of Robotech II (the original feature length film produced for the aborted 65 episode of Sentinels) which has the marriage between Rick Hunter and Lisa Hayes ?  I once had this film on VHS and now I'm glad that I regained it since it makes a good addition to the Macross collection.
To put it blunt (damn, this almost sounds like some commercial yet isn't intended that way): if you got the 1st 2 boxed sets then its hard to get around this one since its a must have. If you got  that far its time to complete it, you'll regret it otherwise.. I took these steps myself and I never regretted it.
One small advice; be prepared for a shocking ending....",1014422400,2,959,4.287292817679558
1633503,4,B00005NG69,"By that I mean the picture quality is like the TV version.  If you loved robotech then get it, it's better then the runned out VHS or RealPlayer converts.  The only annoying thing was that every episode is like the TV series so you get the intro-outtro and the breaks for commercial.",1008720000,2,283,4.423076923076923
1633504,4,B00005NG69,"The Macross saga of Robotech finally winds up with this box set (the last 12 shows on 2 discs), as well as the Sentinels feature film salvaged from what was to be a new series that got the axe after the completion of only a handful of episodes. Like the previous Robotech DVDs released thus far, the picture & sound quality of the episodes aren't too much better than their VHS counterparts. But, at least they're now preserved on a more durable format. Also, with six eppies per platter, you're savin' a lotta shelf space compared to the old VHS tapes which held, at most, 4 shows per. Now you have a place to put some of your other fave 80's `toonage platters! Gotta give He-Man & the ThunderCats their little niches too, you know?
This particular box set is the only way to get The Sentinels on DVD, which is the bonus disc's main feature. Speaking of the bonus disc, it has its good points and bad points. The 10-minute-long Sentinels promo featurette included a nice amount of scenes created for the aborted series which never made it into the video-release movie. Some of the dialogue, however, was re-dubbed using different voice actors. Then there's the movie itself. I was somewhat disappointed by the picture quality-- it wasn't all that different from what I used to see when I had it on VHS. The sound quality's not all that different, either. On the upside, though: like the other two platters included in this set, at least I don't have to worry about the disc deteriorating after several viewings like I would've with video tape (granted I take good care of the disc's playing surface, `natch).
Writer/producer Carl Macek's feature-length commentary for `The Sentinels' doesn't cover too much on the making of the series/movie per se. Rather, he discusses how Japanese anime is conceptualized and produced, its history, and the differences between anime and American animation. His commentary is taken directly from Robotech Art 3, which he authored. I happen to own a copy of this particular publication, so in my case his verbal commentary didn't really cover any new ground. However, since the Robotech Art Books have been out of print for several years, and thus are very hard to find, it'll likely be quite new to most viewers. Just don't expect to be wowed by Macek's delivery-- he's a pretty soft-spoken guy!
Also included are character & mecha sketches, many of which haven't been published before. And, like the previous Robotech Legacy Collection bonus DVDs, this one includes various scenes from the Macross saga in various European languages. Sadly, I think most of the foreign dubs sound better than the English (American) dubs! The Euro voice actors really took pride in their work!

1633507,5,B00005NG69,"The Robotech Legacy:  Macross Saga Collection 3, a three disc collection, contains episodes 25 through 36 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.  The first two discs contain six episodes each.  The third disc contains the ""Exclusive DVD feature presentation"" of ""Robotech II:  The Sentinels,"" the little seen feature film of the aborted ""Season Two"" of Robotech.  It is only available if you purchase this boxed set.  Out of all the releases, the special feature makes this 3rd Boxed Set Collection a MUST OWN!!!
Set in the 21st century, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s.  Known for its cutting edge animation, high tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three generations, weaving together three separate actual Japanese anime series.  The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed when a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth.  The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone, end all wars and unite to assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come.  As the story unfolds mankind would go on to become embattled in an intergalactic struggle, battling three separate alien races over the next 60 years.
This volume chronicles the dramatic conclusion of the first season - The Macross Saga.  In this collection we see the dramatic (and destructive) climax of the Zentraedi - Earth war and its fallout as well as the final resolution to the love triangle between Rick, Lisa and Minmei, as well as foreshadowing of events to come.

Disc 3:  Elements of Robotechnology III

1. Feature Film:  Robotech II:  The Sentinels.  MUST SEE, this is the ""sequel"" to the original 85 episode series picking up right after the Macross Saga.  Find out what happens to Rick, Lisa, Minmei, Max, Miriya and all the rest.  The story picks up 9 years after the last episode of the Macross Saga as the REF gets ready to depart for the Robotech Masters' Homeworld.  It ties up all the lose storylines from all 3 generations.
2. Audio Commentary with Carl Macek:  Another MUST LISTEN.  Macek voice-overs the feature presentation once again offering insights not only into the storyline of Robotech, but also it's production as well as the animation world as well.
3. Robotech II:  The Sentinels promo:  10 minute promo highlighting scenes from the aborted 65 episode Sentinels series.
4. Character and Mecha sheets from the Sentinels
5. Bios for characters from the Sentinels.  Great background info revealing a lot of the storylines of what would have been...
Out of all the releases so far this is the MUST OWN.  The Sentinels features on the E3 disc is a MUST HAVE for all true fans of the series as you'll see what would have been in store had the series continued into a second season.
Robotech is BY FAR one of THE BEST animation products EVER.  If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane.  Honestly, watching these episodes now I can honestly say that they are better than I remember.  You can't lose!!!

Robotech manages to appeal to all generations all over the world, because of it's solid story telling, and complex plot. Robotech boasts some Amazing animation, and a superb soundtrack.
Don't let reports of bad picture or sound quality bother you.... it's robotech in it's original form... and the best I've ever seen it look or sound !!!!

7946899,5,B00005NG69,"There were seven releases in the ""Legacy"" series.  Each 3 disk DVD set contained around 12 episodes split onto 2 DVDs, plus a bonus DVD.
Set #3 contains Episodes 25-30 on Disk 05 and Episodes 31-36 on Disk 06.
Set #3's bonus disk - E3 - contains the release of Robotech II: The Sentinels (aka: what survived the failed series attempt).

So far as the various versions go... These days there look to be several versions floating around out there.  The rare versions are out of stock or cost a mint, so that leaves either the Legacy or Remastered editions.

What the Legacy versions have going for them:
- Original 1985-ish sound effects.
- Blurry low res details.

What the Remastered versions have going for them:
- Specialized (aka Star Wars ""Specialized"") sound effects that some fans don't care for.
- Sharpened details and better coloring schemes, but digital artifacts and ""distortions"" from 1985 are still present.
- ""The Protoculture Collection"" has all 85 episodes plus what appears to be the seven bonus disks from the Legacy series.
- ""The Complete Set"" version contains all 85 episodes plus (I think) the contents of the seven bonus disks along with the two recent releases (Shadow Chronicles and LLA OVA).  The Complete Set also has the advantage of taking up a very small amount of space with it's efficient space-saving packaging.  ""TCS"" has The Sentinels on it's Bonus Disk #4 and does include ""extras"" like the audio commentary by Carl Macek. But I read this version has removed (? some of ?) the ""Macross"" scenes (? licensing issues ?).

So far as Legacy and Remastered goes... Flip a coin as to which one you want to get, or just get both as ""used"" copies don't cost all that much.  Not to mention you can stream these off a certain website beginning with ""A"".  So far as a higher quality BD release of ""Robotech"", odds are that may not be happening.  So if one wants this in BD, best bet would be to get those releases (Macross + SC + GCM) from Japan and then (perhaps?) look for what I have heard called ""fan subs"" as I don't think the BD releases come with English subtitles.",1513728000,,2096,4.592493297587131

7946906,4,B00005NG69,"Robotech: The Macross Saga - Legacy Collection 3 is a three-disc DVD box set that was released in 2001 by ADV Films.  The first disc in the set contains the following episodes: ""Wedding Bells,"" ""The Messenger,"" ""Force of Arms,"" ""Reconstruction Blues,"" ""Robotech Masters,"" and ""Viva Miriya.""  The second disc in the set contains the final six episodes of the Macross portion of Robotech: ""Khyron's Revenge,"" ""Broken Heart,"" ""A Rainy Night,"" ""Private Time,"" ""Season's Greetings,"" and ""To the Stars.""

The third DVD in the set is labeled as ""Robotech The Sentinels - Elements of Robotechnology III.""  This DVD contains all of the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is Robotech II: The Sentinels, which is a feature-length film that was created from animation produced for the aborted sixty-five episode Sentinels series.  There is also a version of this feature that includes audio commentary provided by Carl Macek.  This feature also has a ""hidden Easter egg""; there is an unlisted audio track, which is just music and sound effects only for Robotech II: The Sentinels.

There are also animation model sheets included.  There are two galleries of model sheets (one is for characters, the other is for mecha).  There are thirty-five pages of character model sheets.  It's interesting to note that some of the characters that appear did not appear in the feature included on the DVD, but would have appeared later in the Sentinels television series.  The mecha model sheets include forty-six pages of mecha that was in the feature, or would have appeared later in the series.  There was also a page that was a ""ship size relation chart.""

The next feature is labeled as ""International Clips.""  The first clip presented is when Rick tells Minmei in the SDF-1's conference room that he loves her.  The second clip is when Rick is telling Minmei goodbye before heading out to the final battle with the Zentraedi fleet, and he tells Minmei that it wouldn't have worked out between them, and how it's funny how much time they wasted.  Both of these clips are available in English, French, Spanish, Portugese, and Italian.  It's disappointing that the footage from the original Japanese series wasn't included in this feature.

Next is a series sales reel for the Sentinels series.  It runs for about ten minutes, and it is a promotional film put together by Harmony Gold to be viewed by broadcast programming executives.  It combines footage from Robotech with newly produced footage for the Sentinels series.  The first scene in the promotional film had to be taken from a work print, because the original master was lost.  Also, it should be noted that the dialogue in the Sentinels footage is different from what actually appears in the feature, and even some of the dialogue in the Robotech footage was changed.

The final extra is character bios for the characters in the Sentinels feature.  There are biographies for Johnathan Wolfe, Exedore, Lynn Minmei, Janice, Lisa Hayes, Rick Hunter, Jack Baker, Breetai, Karen Penn, Cabell, Rem, Miriya Sterling, and Max Sterling.

Overall, this is a decent DVD set.  Even though I wish ADV Films had gone to more effort to remaster the video for this release, I would still recommend this box set.  However, it is now out of print.  Even though ADV Films has released other Robotech box sets, I prefer this original set.  If you are a fan of Robotech and happen to stumble upon a used copy of this DVD set, I would recommend picking it up.",1230681600,,3502,4.906462585034014

Will always have the place of honor in my heart.  Even if you are not familar with Robotech, it's worth getting into as it's really unique.",1216598400,,427,4.023809523809524
7946908,1,B00005NG69,"Robotech is the classic English translation of three Japanese cartoon series Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada.  To say that the Robotech Saga was great does it no justice.  Robotech is extraordinary.  One of the first animes to make the jump from Japan to the US, Robotech brought animation to a whole new level in the US.
This isn't a cartoon with 30-minute essentially non-related episodes.  The Robotech Saga melds 3 different Japanese cartoons into one storyline.  Although I am not the biggest fan of Southern Cross or the 3rd Generation, the First generation, which encompasses the first 36 Episodes of Robotech is simply stellar.  The storyline is robust, characters are amazingly developed, and the action is amazing.  The animation may be a bit plain, but considering that Macross was first drawn 20 years ago, I would argue that it has withstood time quite well.
Although Robotech is a must-own for any fan of anime, DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!  ADV is coming out with a remastered version of Robotech on DVD which will include digitally remastered video,  sound, and additional footage never before aired in the US.  I unfortunately bought this set well before the announcement of the new set and was somewhat disappointed with the video and sound quality of these DVDs.  In addition, most of the Bonus DVDs in these sets contain useless items, except for E3, which contains the Sentinels episodes.  My recommendation would be to buy the E3 bonus disc separately and wait for the Remastered version to be released.",1074729600,2,1525,4.960629921259843
