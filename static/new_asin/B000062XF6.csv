(7.5) SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF! (1969) - James Garner, Joan Hackett, Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan, Jack Elam, Henry Jones, Bruce Dern, Willis Bouchey, Gene Evans
A stranger on his way to Australia rides into the town of Calendar during the insanity of a gold rush. He agrees to become temporary sheriff and is soon the target of the Danby clan, a dangerous family that's already killed three previous lawmen. Definitely recommended.

(6.8) SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER (1971) - James Garner, Suzanne Pleshette, Jack Elam, Harry Morgan, Joan Blondell, Marie Windsor, John Dehner, Henry Jones, Dub Taylor, Willis Bouchet, Gene Evans, Grady Sutton, Ellen Corby, Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez (uncredited: Chuck Connors)
Latigo Smith is a playboy/conman who escapes from a gal intent on marrying him in Denver by secretly leaving their train in the small town of Purgatory. The townspeople mistake Smith for gunslinger Swifty Morgan and when the real Swifty comes to town, Latigo must meet him for a showdown. There's a lot more going on in this genuinely amusing western, which I've always preferred to the first movie.",1296259200,,1391,5.285067873303167
7957919,4,B000062XF6,"I bought this because I remember watching ""Support You Local Sheriff"" with my dad when I was a kid.  This movie is funny in a quirky kind of way.

James Garner plays the part of a man who is ""on his way to Australia"".  When he stops in a small town that just discovered gold, chaos reigns & they're looking for a sheriff (one that'll last more than a day or two).  There are no bars in the jail yet, but when hired as a town tamer, somehow he convinces a man who's committed murder to stay in his cell (with no bars).

I didn't think ""Gunfighter"" was as funny, but still worth it if you enjoy westerns.",1285372800,,602,4.067796610169491

60 for who and 40 for who?
Down through time it is easy to get the ""support your local"" films mixed up. This is the first. This is an educational film teaching you everything from sharing to proper gun pointing etiquette. Everyone has his or her favorite part in this movie. It contains sight gages, puns, and jokes (some take time to think about.)
I will not go into detail incase you have not seen this as it is fun to watch the story unfold. However, it is several overlapping stories tied together by Jason McCullough (James Garner) who has spent four years on his way to Australia and stops for a little gold prospecting. He needs a job to buy food while prospecting, as the position of sheriff is available.
O.K. I cannot help it. He is handed the badge with a dent from a bullet in it.
James Garner: This must have saved his life.
Harry Morgan: It would have, if it weren't for all those other bullets.
This movie may not have all the DVD goodies you look for but it is DVD so it will last as long as the technology.
*** Support Your Local Gunfighter ***
""Have you seen Elmer?""

Latigo Smith (James Garner) barely escapes marital bliss with Goldie, to find himself in a situation with out money but an excellent opportunity. The town he as escaped to (Purgatory) has rival mining companies digging for the motherload. Latigo teams up with Jug May (Jack Elam) who poses as Swifty Morgan, hired gun. Latigo is his agent and handles all the money.
The fun in this movie is the interaction of the characters much more than the story. One thing that struck me as funny is the scene where Col. Ames is stretching over in his stiff boots to see if Taylor Barton (Harry Morgan) is hiding under his sister's bead. Another is when Jug sees Latigo asking a woman for money, he says that he was brought up not to ask women for money. Latigo suggest that is because a woman raised him.
Who will get the load and who will get the shaft? Will the real Swifty show up? What about Goldie?",1260489600,,2013,4.368
