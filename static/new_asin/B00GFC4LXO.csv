8622592,5,B00GFC4LXO,"This DVD complements the ""Anychair Yoga"" book by the same author. It presents two complete programs. The first one, ""Rise and Shine"" matches the sequences and intensity levels suggested in the book, while the second one, ""Power Up"" adds complexity and boosts intensity levels, beyond the sequences presented in the book.
As a Nurse Practitioner working with individuals who are coping with very serious chronic illnesses both physical and mental, the book offered me another tool for enticing my patients to give health a chance. Every year I teach a class on relaxation exercises and stress management techniques.  This year I used ""Anychair Yoga"" to teach chair yoga.  This book provides easy instructions and pictures tell the rest. I developed four classes and began each class with sounds from the ocean or nature to slow their breathing.  I selected about eight exercises to thoroughly go over with them and ended the class with a guided healing meditation.  Each class I added a few more exercises until finally at the end of the month we went through most of the exercises featured in the ""Anychair Yoga"" book smoothly.  Participation was tenuous at first but by the fourth session more than two thirds of a group of seventeen were participating in many of the exercises.  Having experienced this class for myself, I endorse this book and the DVD version is a great companion.
On the last class one of the nurses from the mental health clinic heard about the class and asked if she could observe.  SURE.  She loved it and wants to do chair yoga for her group.  I ordered another book to give to her and I ordered the DVD too.  I would love to introduce more clinicians to this wonderful teaching.  I think it would be worthwhile to develop some sort of certification program for this.",1387152000,2,1792,4.804560260586319
8622593,5,B00GFC4LXO,"As a fan of chair yoga practice and as an owner of the Anychair Yoga book, I eagerly awaited the DVD version. Chair yoga is suitable for a wide range of people and situations, and I was curious how the DVD could handle all this diversity. A sample practice, named Anychair Yoga, has been already available on YouTube. As it turned out, the author addresses this challenge by offering two programs on the same DVD. The first one, Rise and Shine shows how to build intensity, in a gradual progression, and represents a milder practice, suitable for anyone, anywhere, using any chair. The second one, Power Up, challenges endurance and is suitable for graduates of the first program and for fit individuals. It really brings Power Yoga to the chair. The chair acts both as a prop and a means for challenging core strength.
I did the ""Rise and Shine"" program, as I need a more gentle practice. Right from the start, Daniela Simina's voice was soft, clear, supportive, and relaxing - in fact it was a great way to relax the body and mind, even before any breath work. The instructions were short, clear and effective. I appreciate how Daniela added some brief explanations about the benefits of the poses and breathing techniques. Throughout the session, modifications were suggested, for people like myself who needed them. The alternate nostril breathing and guided relaxation components, in lieu of Shavasana, were restorative and sweet. I was amazed that though I was sitting on a chair, the practice felt like I was flowing gracefully in a dance sequence.",1385942400,2,1555,4.849624060150376
