8703833,5,B004GCX66I,"I have never done any snow sports and at the ripe old age of 49 I decided to go Snowboarding. I grew up in San Diego on skateboards so I did have a slight skill advantage as I embarked on this adventure. I watched half the video and learned pretty much all I needed to know. I have a short attention span sometimes. Anyways, I hit the slopes and was shredding greens and some blues on the first day. Day one was a blast! Day two: I thought I was a pro and went down ""Longshot"" at Snowmass Village in the Aspen area.  5.4 miles of blue and black. I got beat up on this one. I didn't break anything but I shoulda stayed on the slopes from the previous day.",1453680000,,654,3.9923664122137406
