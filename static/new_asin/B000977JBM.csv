8057710,5,B000977JBM,"An outstanding collection of 36 Spaghetti Western previews put out by WILD EAST PRODUCTIONS, a dvd company specialising in releasing eurowesterns, war films and peplums. I love these movies and have stacks of 'em in old large-boxed vhs format. WILD EAST products are offered through amazon and you, like myself, can load up on some off-beat fun films!
This preview dvd is nicely produced. Each trailer is introduced by  poster artwork which is then shot full of holes! Only a couple of the previews are oft-seen classics: ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE. Most are ones of films you're probably dying to see: RENEGADE GUNFIGHTER, 7 DEVILS ON HORSEBACK, THE DEVIL WAS AN ANGEL, SHOTGUN, A NAME THAT CRIED REVENGE, MAGNIFICENT TEXAN, KILL THE WICKEDS, BROTHER OUTLAW, I'LL DIE FOR VENGENCE, RIO HONDO, SAVAGE GUNS, BULLET IN THE FLESH, etc., etc.
All in all, great viewing enjoyment! A nice selection of hard to find previews looking sharp! Highly recommended!",1214697600,12,977,4.9573170731707314
