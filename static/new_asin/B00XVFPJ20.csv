8716707,5,B00XVFPJ20,"Another terrific entry in the European western genre from Kino Lorber. THE MERCENARY, directed by Sergio Corbucci (THE GREAT SILENCE) easily slides into any top 10 Spaghetti Western list you care to look up. The fantastic cast stars Franco Nero, who I regard as the ""Steve McQueen"" of European cinema. He exudes coolness here as a deadly gun- for- hire with a cynical attitude toward humanity in general. Tony Musante was also a very well regarded actor who did a ton of television work in the USA including the eccentric prison series OZ that was produced by HBO. He portrays an ambitious peon turned revolutionary here and is also the target of comical verbal abuse by a sarcastic Nero. Honestly, in this story they are as memorable as Newman and Redford at their best. Jack Palance ( as usual ) is in a movie of his own as the ruthless, religious and insane villain Curly. Giovanna Ralli as the romantic interest and passionate revolutionary is wonderful as well. She is that rare female who looks more beautiful without make-up than with. You won't soon forget those beautiful brown eyes and marvelous facial expressions.
The movie itself has a few continuity problems, especially at the beginning. The plot jumps from one plot point to the next in rapid succession leaving the viewer to fill in the gaps with what might have happened in between but the main narrative is always there. It's also made clear at the beginning that the movie is told as a flashback , up until the pivotal showdown anyway. It's a great showdown too. Absolutely unique! Surreal and intense with a rodeo clown in pancake VS a dandified psychopath watched over by an ambivalent referee. A great Ennio Morricone soundtrack plays as the clock ticks away. Really unforgettable. Violent and comical. Pure genius.
The film looks great in Blu. The packaging is original theatrical release art which, as a collector, I am a sucker for. ( when will these movies get steelbooks?) The extras are mostly trailers along with some interesting MERCENARY production pictures. There is a quite good audio commentary by Alex Cox as well. Top notch all the way around !",1513468800,8,2131,4.825136612021858
