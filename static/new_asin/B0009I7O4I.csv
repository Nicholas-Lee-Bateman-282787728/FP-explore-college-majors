2291738,5,B0009I7O4I,A touching memoir of John's life.  The interviews with his former wife Annie and his friends give background information about John that has not been shared before.,1137283200,10,164,5.074074074074074
2291739,5,B0009I7O4I,"the best JD documentary out there.  the history of the songs is brought to life by annie and those who worked closely with john denver, and john denver's own narration.  video clips of performances from the 70s and 80s flow almost seemlessly together.  we have been waiting for this one.",1135123200,21,287,4.7

2291742,5,B0009I7O4I,"Of all the bio's or rememberance documentaries done on an artist, I have to say this was the best of all that I've seen!  It was very insightful covering what inspired John to write certain songs, what was happening in his life during the times he was writing them, and gave a well rounded perspective of his life and career taken from his own narratives as well as those who knew him personally or worked with him through the years.  A definite ""Must have"" for any John Denver fan!!!",1125792000,161,484,4.426966292134831

2291745,5,B0009I7O4I,John Denver was a special musician and tunesmith who wrote and sang his music in such a pure form that it's almost critic proof.  This doc is not full of info or even told in a linear fashion but is more a remembrance of the feeling John Denver created in those who knew the man and loved his work.  While watching it I was instantly transported to a much more innocent time in my life.  Denver's music has always struck a spiritual cord but is never dogmatic.  It's the kind of spiritual that anyone can partake in and wind up feeling more human.  This is a must companion to any John Denver collection.,1121731200,186,604,4.3097345132743365
2291766,5,B0009I7O4I,"Wonderful! The scenery breathtaking! The stories wonderful! His singing, as always, amazing! I loved every minute of it, but was then so disappointed when it was over!

2291767,1,B0009I7O4I,"Very poor video quality.  I echo some other reviews in this matter.  Not at all happy with it.  This is not a reflection on the vendor. I thought at first it was a bootlegged copy but then the disc label and case label are original.  And with others saying the same thing, it is probably just a garbage DVD. John Denver, Country Boy from PBS much better. At least it was inexpensive.",1489190400,2,383,4.277777777777778

BUT I'LL LET IT SLIDE..GUESS THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY, BY PUTTING A DIFFERENT JACKET ON FRONT, AND THINKING IT'S SOMETHING NEW...  MY BAD I GUESS.

2291846,2,B0009I7O4I,"If this is all you have for a John Denver tribute documentary I guess it rates 3 or more stars. But if you've had a chance to see the new documentary currently airing on PBS - ""John Denver, Country Boy"" - you'll immediately see why this rates only (at best) 2 stars.

In comparison to the new BBC offering this 2005 effort comes across a no better than a first draft. Yes, the new 2014(?) tribute is that much better (making this 2005 documentary - yes - that bad).

What's better? Just about everything. The new documentary print is widescreen, this 2005 effort is 4:3. The video quality of the segments of the newer documentary are cleaner in both audio and video, this 2005 edition is grainy. Take, for instance, the interviews. Annie (Denver) and Milt Okun look better in 2014 than they did in 2005.

But what's really better in the newer documentary is the story. Yes, it glosses over some things so that it comes across more as eulogy than documentary, but the BBC version makes sense. It puts John Denver into context; this 2005 effort fails miserably: it's just segments on a particular aspect of J.D. So in finishing this 2005 documentary I didn't feel like I knew J.D. any better than I did prior to viewing. With the new BBC documentary I honestly feel like I know the man better and as such can appreciate him (and his music) more.

It's not that I dislike this documentary; in fact, had I seen it before the BBC one on PBS I'd probably rate it 4 stars. C'mon, it's John Denver! How could you not give it at least 4 stars? But I'm seeing this documentary after watching the new one and the verdict is in: in a head-to-head with the new BBC edition this 2005 Sony offering absolutely fails in every regard.

Don't waste your money here; find the PBS-offered BBC documentary and enjoy!",1425945600,6,1795,4.477064220183486

2291848,5,B0009I7O4I,"Very nice and nostalgic.  Hats off to Annie who has forgiven his unfaithful roving.  Stardum is a hard burden .
John wrote beautiful songs with good values for the most part.",1414454400,,174,4.580645161290323

2291855,4,B0009I7O4I,"As one with musical aspirations myself, I loved John's music all through the '70s and '80s.  He was a true musical prodigy and he loved life and nature.  Anyone who appreciates this would likely enjoy this DVD.  I just wish there was a more in depth treatment of his life & times available.

Nice revisit of his important performances... and the interviews were okay.  But still not exactly what I wanted, which would be an accurate and complete chronological biography of his life.  Of course this doesn't really exist in video form.  The TV movie (2000) was sadly rather apocryphal, just to say the least.  (As a minimum, I'm surprised that the Bio Channel hasn't produced one yet.)

Bottom line: I will probably pick up a copy of his autobiography,",1405555200,,751,4.7153846153846155
2291886,5,B0009I7O4I,"Although I have many of John Denver's CD's, this CD covers songs that I did not have on all the others.",1404345600,,103,3.9523809523809526
2291887,5,B0009I7O4I,This is one terrific DVD. I do not believe you have to be a major John Denver fan to appreciate this DVD. Another great talent gone too soon.,1401321600,,141,4.071428571428571
2291888,5,B0009I7O4I,"I have been a fan of John Denver for many years.  Since I never had the opportunity to attend his concerts, purchasing this DVD gave me a glimpse of him on stage, and how loved ones remembered him.  It seemed he truly enjoyed his talent and singing his haunting love songs.",1397692800,,273,4.333333333333333

2291890,5,B0009I7O4I,"This story of John Denver was produced after his death as told by his exwife, his long time producer and manager,and fellow musicians.  This documentars has insights into his personality, his music, and his passions from his early life until his death.  It also has a photo gallery.  I would recommeornd this to anyone that followed his career from the beginning or anyone who discovered him later in life.  He is missed by us all.",1381104000,4,431,4.706666666666667

2291893,5,B0009I7O4I,"I love this DVD because it is a real tribute to the great John Denver with interviews with people who knew him well. The sight of the stones with the words of his songs carved on them was wonderful.  Now that I have the DVD instead of the copy from the PBS special I see how much his voice changed over the years.  The l995 Wildlife concert shows him looking older but his voice so much richer.  And, on this Remembered DVD it is evident as some of the songs are from the early days and some from later at the end of his career and life.  When I saw him in concert in the mid 70s I thought he was wonderful but I wish I'd seen one of the later concerts when he had matured so much.  What a great talent. A genius in my estimation. Long to be remembered. All John Denver fans should have this in their collection.",1364515200,,812,4.0186335403726705

2291898,5,B0009I7O4I,"When I first saw this documentary on PBS I was so moved.  This man was given a gift by God to create lyrics that described some of God's greatest gifts to us all, love, nature, relationships with Him and each other.  John was an average looking man who succeeded on his creative talents alone.  Thank God we have his music and this DVD tribute because we lost him way too early.",1355961600,,378,4.295774647887324
2291899,5,B0009I7O4I,"I guess it goes without saying that I was and still am a huge John Denver fan.  I have enjoyed listening to his music since the very earliest days as his career was just taking off.

This DVD is the best I have seen on his life and career.  It is peppered with interviews of those who knew him best, and video from some of his concerts, travels and conservation efforts throughout his career.

John Denver Remembered Is a must have DVD if you are a fan.  I have several other John Denver DVDs that attempted to do what this one did perfectly.",1324080000,3,542,4.223300970873787
2291900,5,B0009I7O4I,"This is a great dvd.  It is very refreshing for those of us Fan's who were unable to go see John Denver in concert. A thing most of us wished we had done in the past' for now, sadly, its too late.  However this brings him into our lives as a sort of personal friend.  Annie also speaks in this and its very good seeing her, and listening to her, knowing she is the  one person dearest to John himself.  It is a real great treat to watch this.  Well worth purchasing.",1323216000,,466,4.010869565217392
2291901,3,B0009I7O4I,"I am a die hard fan of John Denver and his music and as such,
I'm baffled by all the ""5 star"" reviews of this DVD; very bad
quality video footage, interesting interviews (especially of Annie
Denver), a ridiculous 7 pic photo gallery, a horribly incomplete
discography, a short but interesting very, very quick visit of John's
Sanctuary in Colorado...it's not that this DVD is bad so much that it is
way too short and incomplete; I suppose you could do hours of footage
and still miss some of his extraordinary career, but 50 minutes to cover
such an important (on many levels) musical giant is almost an insult
to his Legacy; if you  buy this DVD knowing it will be a blink of his
masterful career, then go ahead, it's worth a look, but don't expect too much
out of it; for the same price, you can get his awesome Nature Conservancy
concert, very HQ, with tons of good quality video commentaries by John Denver himself;
I hate to pan anything that has to do with John Denver but the producers of this
so called documentary were in a rush to make money or were terribly lazy.",1311120000,14,1074,4.424242424242424
2291902,5,B0009I7O4I,"Experience the candid interview and sing along to his most popular songs in this collector's dvd. A Song's Best Friend brings back so many sweet memories from years gone by... it opens the door for your heart to enjoy and appreciate John Denver at his very best... it makes you want to tap your feet to his unique blend of folk songs and get cozy up with your sweetie at the same time. The bonus features are particularly special as it captures the long lost footage of John's concerts. The true essence of John's songs is beautifully reflected in ""Annie's Song"", ""This Old Guitar"", ""Rocky Mountain High"", etc. ""Sunshine On My Shoulders"" captures his deep passion for the outdoors/wilderness and its ongoing conservation. This DVD will take you back where life is a whole lot simpler and songs are meant to be enjoyed and treasured. If you are raised on John Denver's songs, this one is truly for you.

2291968,5,B0009I7O4I,"I believe ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" was the first song I ever heard John Denver sing. Or it may have been ""Sunshine On My Shoulders."" For a lot of us of Denver's generation, we remember the first time we heard a particular song, its association with friends, some long since dead, others a long time missing. Many of the biggest hits are here of the man who exemplifies the best of America. He warmed us with his beautiful music; he cared about the earth. Surely he was the great O Positive. Who else would have been so at home singing with artists as different as Johnny Cash and Placido Domingo?

In addition to footage of John singing, there is also commentary by him about his songs and his love of nature as well as interviews with John's wife Annie, some of the musicians who played with him and others in the music industry. In a particularly moving segment Annie remembers all the unusual places she has heard ""Annie's Song,"" from a square in Venice to an elevator in Japan. Someone else comments that Wagner had one piece of wedding music while John had two!

Looking at this DVD once again, as always I am amazed at how John Denver seemingly never aged. Of course now he belongs to the ages although he left us far too soon. It is useless to speculate about how many other great songs he would have written as he became older and more venerable, the elder statesman of the folk/pop world. Near the end of this not-to-be-missed tribute to John Denver, his wife comments softly that ""we miss him."" She speaks for thousands of the rest of us in that nostalgic, sad moment.",1196467200,28,1583,4.474048442906574
2291969,4,B0009I7O4I,"I saw this on PBS and decided to add it to my DVD collection.  It is less a biography and more a profile of the man as an entertainer and songwriter during his peak years of popularity.  Growing up in the 70's you could not help but find his music very appealing.  The only gripe I have is that this DVD, even with the extras, is not anywhere near 82 minutes long, but it is still a good buy nonetheless.",1195344000,4,404,4.025

I saw this on PBS but at the time they were having pledge breaks. The DVD does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. Even PBS may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.",1191715200,2,688,3.9927536231884058

It gives you an idea in what state of mind John was when he wrote and composed the songs. I'd never knew, till now, how specific he was in writing his songs. If I listen to the songs now, I feel so much closer to them and understand them better then I did before !I also can ""image"" the lyrics now, which is great ! For everybody who loves his music, you must add this dvd to your collection.",1191628800,3,486,3.9693877551020407
2291973,5,B0009I7O4I,"It's been 10 years, and I still feel a pang of sadness that John is no longer with us. I first saw this documentary on PBS and it just about moved me to tears as I reminisced about the songs and how each one had come to mean something special and personal to me over the years. I suppose that is the way it is with all music that touches you...you somehow make it your own and become forever connected to the singers and songwriters that create it. John Denver had that profound and almost magical ability to connect with listeners. Musicians like him don't come around very often. That is why this is a documentary to be treasured by every fan. Rent, buy, borrow it and enjoy!",1190160000,8,677,4.296875
2291974,4,B0009I7O4I,"John's songs are a treasure, but so is his friendly, inclusive call to join him in passionate causes.  It is wonderful to hear him talk about what inspired the eloquent messages he put in his music, from issues in his life to nature's beauty.  A Song's Best Friend is a short but inspiring blend of music and commentary that displays John's huge impact on our social conscience.",1183680000,2,378,4.626865671641791
2291975,5,B0009I7O4I,"John Denver and his music were a big part of my life growing up, so I remember him with a great deal of nostalgia.  But this documentary goes beyond nostalgic reminiscing, since it also allows you to appreciate the enormity of John's contribution to the world of popular music--and to the world itself.  It is a celebration of his life and his talent, and honors him without getting overly sentimental or sensationalistic.  The DVD is a must for any John Denver fan, and is definitely one you'll watch more than once. It's that good.",1183680000,7,533,4.648936170212766

2292004,4,B0009I7O4I,"Overall I liked this production/documentary of John Denver's life.  The DVD chapters aren't chronological, but rather each attempts to address a different aspect of his career (for example, some of the chapter titles are ""A Steward of the Earth,"" ""The Embodiment of Love,"" and ""The Showman"").  There are also many interviews with the people who knew JD best, and this helps to weave the chapters together.

However, I did realize eventually that this DVD covers mainly JD's RCA career, which ended around 1986.  That might be because the vast majority of his hits came from the 1970s, but even the concert footage included on the DVD (four songs) are from the 1970s and early 1980s.  There is nothing here from 1986 to 1997 (the year he died).  While that's not absolutely necessary, I suppose, it felt to me like it was lacking something.

Still, despite this, I enjoyed the program.  And most Denver fans will too.  Artists like Denver don't come around very often.

If, like myself, John Denver--his work and his humanity--meant something to you, you will want to own this video. I recommend it.",1137283200,27,397,4.591549295774648

8061176,5,B0009I7O4I,"In many ways, this film is difficult to watch. The film clips of the early 70s brought me back to my undergrad days at university, hearing John Denver on the radio and seeing him in concert.

John Denver was born Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr and then later changed his name to the more easy-going and easily-pronounced name: John Denver.

This film deftly stitched together Johns life with the helping hands of those closest to him: his first wife, Annie Martell Deutschendorf, his brother Ron, his manager, his producer, and Bill and Taffy Danoff, to name a few.

The most poignant part of the film came from Annie, a practicing psychologist in Aspen who, after having suffered numerous affairs from John while he was on the road, while she was staying home with their children, understandably divorced John. In hindsight, Annie has gained much wisdom and said that their marriage could have been saved if they had both been more mature. She says that neither of them could deal with Johns fame very well. John did not realize what a gem Annie was, but later, after he had matured, he did.

His brother, Ron, also was very honest about growing up with John and describing Johns taking off and going to California and their dad flying someones jet to get him, and bring him back home. They first took a detour to Disneyland before going home! Ron fought in the Vietnam War, while John was a peace activist. This was jarring; John was against what Ron had been drafted to do.

In this film, watching the narrow band of Johns work from the early to mid-70s, was heart-warming, because I feel that this work was his best.

Because of this wonderful DVD, John will always be with us.",1523232000,3,1679,4.636363636363637
