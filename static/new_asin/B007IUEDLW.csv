You keep watching because you know David's going to uncork a funny line every so often.  He made my husband, my 11-year-old daughter and me all chuckle together.

5089741,1,B007IUEDLW,"I actually thought that I might enjoy learning something after watching the introduction of ""Hunting the Elements"". After all, this is Nova, right? But instead I end being verbally and visually assaulted by a pathetic jerk who feels compelled to dumb down the content of the program with lame comedic interludes in order, I suppose, to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the viewing public, if the viewing public is twelve years old and tuning in to modern day equivalent of Soupy Sales. His interviews with experts in their fields were reminiscent of those conducted by Jon Stewart's sidekicks on the Daily Show, designed not to elicit intelligent discourse, but to make the interviewee and viewers cringe. I cannot express how deeply disappointed I am in Nova, knowing that David Pogue will have a hand in future episodes. Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",1333756800,15,864,4.9655172413793105

5089751,5,B007IUEDLW,"I find that just about anything on chemistry is worthwhile watching or reading.  This one is no exception.  Some of the reviewers note that it isn't the best at explaining chemistry for a class.  That view does have some merit -- it is no substitute for a class that's properly structured, well taught, and has much more time.  There's just too much (good) detail in chemistry to cover more than a smattering in a couple of hours, be it book or documentary for the masses.

A blessing comes with that curse.  Yes, a lot of it is review -- I knew what protons and isotopes etc. are, but not everyone does.  What saves it from being something just for the kiddies is the fact that they always show something that I've either never seen or only saw once long, long ago.  Tossing sodium into water brought back memories from long, long ago when I was the member of a summertime ""chemistry club"" and saw the same thing.

Then there are the developments of new technologies and things that you can't see in a classroom, grade school, high school or college:  showing explosions and their effects, showing atoms through an electron microscope ... the list goes on.

Watching one of these things it's almost impossible not to see a number of things that it's simply very hard to see any other way -- unless you have your own lab (or two or three!)

Highly recommended if you like science (and especially if you don't).",1422748800,,1410,4.529644268774703

The style is highly creative, with an amazing mix and balance of  physical principles, infectious humor, and visual effects to make anyone shy and hesitant about science to want to do some independent research and investigation on her or his own time.
Kudos to the creators, writers, and especially to the presenter, for this wonderful video. The obvious, and subtle, humor alone makes this a must-see presentation on a very fundamental part of chemistry. Despite a comment from a teacher who felt it might be a distraction, many students benefit from getting a visual picture of the underlying principles of a science topic first---this in turn will give them sufficient motivation for further in-depth exploration.",1418860800,,801,5.161538461538462

5089758,5,B007IUEDLW,"From my standpoint, as a person who was discouraged most of my life from pursuing a career in science, there is definitely a place for this type of video. It is for the young and those who want to stay mentally young, but need an introduction to science. It might not be sufficiently complex or organized for high-school teachers and beyond, but it allows those of us who are self-educated to glide gracefully into a miraculous world we did not know was there or were denied entrance to by more formal systems. I learn more from starting with this kind of video and by buying the teaching company videos, many of which are available here. I am not alone in thinking a transitional system to stimulate interest in a subject definitely has its place. If you need more technically intensive material, then get more technically intensive material. When I am ready for that, I will do it myself. I am teaching myself medicine, anatomy, a little physics and chemistry, law, geology and math. My education may be slow and spotty, but nobody can stop me now that I have found self-education. Don't knock it. Look at the hard science fiction authors like Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, Gregory Binford ... the list goes on in every thought process known to humans. Without them as my companions since I was 8 years old, I would have turned into a miserable robot. Asimov wrote so much for the ""common"" populace that we don't have to sit in ignorant misery at the behest of anyone.
I haven't bought this one yet, but I am going to, because the teaching company video is college level, and I don't have enough background in math, another thing I must remedy.

Hunting the Elements teaches *science* more than it teaches scientific knowledge - curiosity, inquiry, method, rigor, and outcomes.  Personally, I find Pogue a little annoying, especially when my daughter starts to pick up some of his mannerisms (""SERIOUSLY?!""), but he is genuinely funny, and turns the periodic table into a wild adventure with a goofy-but-lovable companion for a tour guide.

I think that it is helpful because a high percentage of kids are visual learners - let's face it, they are a generation weened on media and visual representations.

""Why do bombs go boom?  How much gold is in 400 tons of dirt?  And how come rare earths [or rare earth elements], the metals that make our gadgets go, aren't that rare at all?

We live in a world of incredible material variety.  Yet everything we know: the stars, the planets, and life itself--comes from about 90 basic building blocks.  All right here on this remarkable chart: the periodic table of the elements.

It's a story that begins with the Big Bang and eventually leads to us.  And we're made almost entirely of just a handful of ingredients including one that burns secret fire inside us all.

Join me as I explore the basic building blocks of the universe.  From some of the most common like oxygen to the least [common]: man-made elements that last only fractions of a second.  Strange metals with repellent powers.  Poisonous gases in stuff we eat every day.  And now we can even see what they're made of.

If you're like me, you care about the elements and how they go together.  Because more than ever MATTER MATTERS.""

The above is what the narrator says in the preview of this remarkable film about the elements.

The narrator and host of this program is David Pogue, a New York Times tech correspondent.  Due to his humour and inquisitiveness, he effectively brings, what can be a dry subject, to life.

As I said, this documentary is about the elements.  What is an element?  It is any substance that cannot be broken down or separated into different substances by ordinary chemical means.  An element is a pure substance.  Examples of elements are given in the title of this review.

Examples of topics covered in this educational film include atomic structure, properties of the elements, the elements of life, radioactive dating, man-made elements and, of course, the periodic table of the elements.

One of my favourite segments in this movie is when we're shown a table that's a periodic table.  (In other words, a periodic table table!!)

Finally, what I did when viewing this film was to have a standard periodic table of the elements to refer too.  In this way, I felt I got maximum value from this educational documentary.

In conclusion, if you were unsure about the elements that make up our universe, I guarantee you will not be unsure about them after viewing this comprehensive film!!

5089789,5,B007IUEDLW,"This video hooked my kids immediately and held their attention.  We spent 3 days watching it (spread over about a 2 week period) and the kids could tell me right where we were in the video...""We were just at the periodic table...""  ""We just saw the popcorn...""  So it was engaging enough that they could remember a week later what they had last seen.

It gives some history of the periodic table, gives some decent basic chemistry information and shows sources and uses of different elements--all in a way that keeps teenagers interested.",1356480000,3,538,4.752688172043011
5089790,5,B007IUEDLW,"An entertaining introduction to elements and the periodic table.

The periodic table is covered pretty well, at an overview level. Not every element is covered of course. But all the sections of the chart are explained, and many individual elements are covered in some depth. The atomic model is introduced and explained very well (electrons, protons, neutrons).

The show is pretty long (a good thing) - 2 hours. It's very visual and the host is entertaining. This show will dispel illusions some kids or adults may have that chemistry is too dry or abstract. It clearly explains what the the periodic table means for us in the everyday, real world.

The elements covered in some detail include: gold, copper, sodium, oxygen, hydrogen, the other major elements of life (carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen, sulfur), trace elements of life (calcium, zinc, etc.), silicon, uranium. Many, many other elements are also mentioned.

The video uses the following to explain and demonstrate the concepts behind the periodic table: gold and gold mining, bronze (alloy) bell casting, combustion and explosions, the elements of life (organics), splitting water into H and O, trace elements in the human body, ancient cyanobacteria as the source of earth's oxygen, fusion and the origin of the elements in stars, glass making, semiconductors, carbon-14 dating, fission reactions, and man-made elements. A whole 15 minutes is also spent on rare earth elements - their mining, their ore, even their shark-repelling properties.

The history of the periodic table is also covered.

I recommend this show to anyone who has a general interest in science. Even if you learned this stuff in school it's a great refresher. I've taken a couple good chemistry courses over the years, but somehow didn't know (or just forgot) that most of the elements are metals. And of course we didn't cover ""rare earths"" much back then - but now they are more important, since they are in all our mobile gadgets. Just a couple examples of how useful this show is.

I'm not a science teacher but I think this would be a great introduction for middle school or high school students. A fun, painless way to introduce chemistry. Curious adults will love it too.

Note: While entertaining, this show is thankfully not frenetic and in your face like other recent NOVAs such as Fabric of the Cosmos. I can barely watch those shows with their fast-flashing images, jarring music, etc. This video is not like that.

I love this video - it packs a lot of the fundamentals of science and technology into a very watchable package. I think every home and school should have a copy of this. My kids will be watching this multiple times over the years.

5089791,5,B007IUEDLW,"Chemistry documentaries of any kind are a rare thing, especially if you're teaching middle school or high school.  The ones that do exist, for the most part, are pretty dry and sleep-inducing.

The nice thing about Hunting the Elements is that it appeals to a pretty wide range of ages and ability levels.  There is an excess of corny jokes, for sure, but these keep the younger and lower-level students attention.  There is also a pretty reasonable level of actual chemistry content: electron orbitals, radioactivity, the breaking and re-assembling of chemical bonds that occur during a reaction, and so on.

The video is also divided into sections that are relevant for different classes, so if you're teaching bio, you can show the 15 minute segment on the elements of life.  Upper level chem students might be more interested in the rare earth metals.",1353628800,3,855,4.944055944055944

There are longer (e.g. 20 segments or more) instructional videos that use to appear on PBS in times past.  Howeever, PBS has shifted away from classroom style instructionals for several years now.  This DVD had a segment on combustion as a redox reaction that I wish I had at the time I was taking classes in chemistry.  I loved it and my 15 year old son (who is just beginning chemistry) loved it.  We also loved the segment on the very recent discovery of the use of rare earth elements as a viable shark repellent (beieve it or not).

Since watching this program several times, our son is now reading books on the Periodic Table, intro. physics, and chemistry. I think school children can benefit from watching programs like this one. Our nation is ranked behind so many other countries in Math & Science. We need to show citizens that Science is not a dry, intellectual subject but it can be exciting.

-The program wanders from topic to topic without clear organization.
-Some of the oversimplifications may conflict with concepts I am trying to teach.  For example, the program refers to electron shells and illustrates these shells as complete or incomplete rings around nuclei.  This might be confusing to students learning about orbitals.
-I would have preferred some topics, such as properties of various chemical families, be explored in more depth.  Instead, too much time was spent on extraneous scenes (exercising to produce sweat, peeing to produce phosphorous, etc.).
To be fair, this program may not have been designed to teach.
There were some graphics, such as the recombination of atoms during the combustion of explosives, that were not bad.
As a side note, PBS has not posted my review, although reviews both newer and older than mine (5 stars, of course) have been posted.  Take the PBS rankings with a grain of salt.",1335139200,81,1072,4.938888888888889

8517868,5,B007IUEDLW,"The following is a letter I wrote to David Pogue who stars in this show (somewhat edited to publish here as a review).  I think it sums up why I gave this program a 5 star review.

Mr. Pogue was kind enough to reply and indicated that he's open to producing more shows if NOVA asks him.  Write to NOVA and let them know!

Dear. Mr. Pogue,

My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed your NOVA productions, ""Hunting the Elements"" and the ""Making Stuff"" series. Please consider talking to NOVA about producing more science programs like this.

I am a science enthusiast who grew up on PBS shows like NOVA and National Geographic and Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Kids (and adults) today are so science illiterate due in part to the fact that science shows today are so boring. Even the new Cosmos show with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Sorry, but it's a yawner!

Most of today's science education programs are not fun or interesting to the general population. And they're not inspiring. We've lost something in the last 30 years. Science popularizers like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye are struggling to bring it back, but they haven't found the right formula (no pun intended). I'm happy for what they're doing, but neither has the humble charm of Carl Sagan. But you do!

But there's more to a program like this than just the personality of the narrator.  Kids these days have a Youtube attention span. (And for that reason, I think even the original Cosmos series, as interesting as it was to me, would fail for today's generation).  It's tough to engage with today's kids (or even adults!) in a 1 or 2-hour special.  Yes, there are some good science programs on Youtube, like Veritasium or It's OK to be Smart, but such programs can't go into the depth that a NOVA special can, and neither can they get access to the resources and facilities that NOVA can.  It's expensive to make a program like this.  The producers of this program have have put in just the right mix of in-depth instruction, animation, talking heads, and humor that has captivated my kids like no other recent science or technology programming has. For the first time ever, my son has actually retained a large portion of what he's learned from the Elements program and asks for more.

I know you are not a scientist and you are mostly a tech writer, but you really come into your own when talking about science.

I watched Hunting the Elements and we're partway through the Making Stuff shows with my children (9 and 11), and for the first time --ever -- they are genuinely interested in science programming that is beyond the length of a Youtube short feature.

I don't care if my kids grow up to be scientists. I do care that they have an appreciation for the methodology of science and the wonder of learning about nature, because that spark of wonder so important even if they're only peripherally involved with chemistry or physics or space or whatever, in their lifetimes.

 I bought both Hunting the Elements and the Making Stuff series on blu-ray after we first saw it on the PBS app in our TV.

You and NOVA have a winning formula! Please talk to NOVA about starring in more science shows.",1498608000,2,3151,4.5846702317290555

8517870,5,B007IUEDLW,"If your into Chemistry, this is a must have in your home.  I loved it.  It was a very informative show for PBS Nova.  During this show there was a miss lead in the penny.  The penny is no longer made of Copper.  Now, the very first pennies were made out of Copper.  However,  pennies are made out of Zinc today.  You can check it out on Wiki.  I will though admit Copper is made out of a lot of things we use in our everyday lives.

I will warn you too that there are explosions in an explosion segment in the video.  The total video time 120 minutes.",1485561600,2,551,3.963302752293578

8517872,5,B007IUEDLW,"As a chemistry teacher, I really love this film.  Good stuff, as it shows how the elements relate to the real world in a variety of ways, many of them surprising and dramatic.  The story is told with some humor (some of it kind of corny), a sense of history and fine demonstrations of very practical properties of the real matter represented on the Periodic Table.

The table of elements is brought to life dramatically with a huge,  beautifully crafted wooden ""table"" of elements built by a chemistry genius.  The table has chambers which hold substantially-sized samples of most all of the elements, including the noble gases, which glow.  Very cool.

Students really seem to enjoy this film and definitely have a much deeper appreciation of its history, meaning and connection to their daily lives.",1477008000,2,801,4.888888888888889
8517873,5,B007IUEDLW,"This is a very thoughtful, and  witty overview o the the stuff that makes up our world. For most classes, it needs some introduction and periodic pauses to consider what is happening in the segment. Also, shorter viewings with a question sheet to follow along and dividing classes into groups for poster presentations helped to make this fine Nova piece a solid tool for introducing the Periodic Table.",1470614400,,402,4.911764705882353
