3945792,5,B002LEXADW,"Wubbzy at his best! My 2.5 year old son stepped on the first DVD of this movie and cried uncontrollably! After giving him the ""you need to be careful with your possessions"" speech, I jumped on Amazon and ordered it again! When it arrived I wish I could have taken a video of his reaction! He was overjoyed! He doesn't get to watch much TV, but he'll pick this over and over when it's his TV time. I give it a thumb's up!",1292889600,4,420,4.072289156626506

3945795,5,B002LEXADW,"What would Christmas be without a Wubzy Christmas special? My sons love Wubbzy, Widget, Walden, and Daizy and the town of Wuzzleburg so much that I have to record episodes and the one DVD we do have, Wubb Idol, we watch constantly! I don't know what it is, but something about the funny, little yellow guy with a wiggly tail just makes all of us laugh, yes me included!

Wubbzy's Christmas Adventure DVD is Wubbzy's first Christmas DVD and it is adorable. The DVD contains five Wubbzy-filled episodes and then one more bonus episode. It is 70 minutes long and I know we will be watching this DVD year-round and for many Christmas's to come.

Wubbzy is not just any cartoon either, but it is educational and actually has great themes. This DVD teaches sharing, giving, helping others, solving problems, and sets a great example for children. The characters are all great friends and keep my son's attention. I also love how colorful and bright the show is, and how even though everyone is different they are all still friends!",1261526400,5,1025,4.688888888888889
