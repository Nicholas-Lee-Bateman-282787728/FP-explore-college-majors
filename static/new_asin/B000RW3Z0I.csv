2875879,5,B000RW3Z0I,"I absolutely love the way America's Game explains the Patriots trips to the Superbowl..they explain everything that has happened during the course of the season and also review the season week by week, my favorite disc on the whole 3-disc set would have to be SBXXXVI, to see a guy like Tom Brady who had been drafted sooo late in the 2000 NFL Draft to carry his team to a Superbowl and win was spectacular. I loved the other ones too but to me I loved SBXXXVI the most, it was great to see them win their first championship, a GREAT DVD!!",1212192000,15,539,4.294117647058823
2875880,5,B000RW3Z0I,"I wish more documentaries about sports were like this. As well as capturing all the action from all the camera angles from NFL films, you really get a feel from inside the patriots camp of what the Super Bowl years meant to the players and coaching staff. The interviews are refreshingly insightful and honest (including some bad language) and the behind the scenes thoughts of the players and management were a joy to watch.
There are plenty of extras as well to round off a truly great series. I can't recommend this highly enough to any Pats fan. I am lifelong Patriot from the UK and watching this nearly brought a tear to my eye. After all the years of suffering and losses, the big victories on here meant so much to me, it was a joy to see and hear the players and the backroom staff give their version of the proudest day of their lives, the day they became Super Bowl champions.  I liked this series so much i intend to get more America's game shows from other NFL teams. There really has been no better documentary ever made about football in my opinion.

Invest in this and relive the Patriots glory years (will they ever stop?!) over and over again. priceless. The only criticism i would have is i was enjoying it so much i wished that each episode was 3 hours long.

 You will not regret buying this. The definitive record of some glorious, never to be forgotten times for any Patriot.",1197936000,6,1398,4.44921875

2875882,5,B000RW3Z0I,"NFL Films has outdid itself with this great 3 DVD set. It features game / season highlights of their 3 Super Bowl seasons (2001, 2003, 2004) with interesting interviews with the star players of each year mixed in. A lot of great stories that fits in well with the game footage being shown. Great Super Bowl footage is featured through out each DVD!
I'm very happy with this collection, and I'm willing to wait for their 4th Super Bowl title with a win in Super Bowl XLII.",1196380800,2,471,4.425287356321839

2875884,5,B000RW3Z0I,"As anyone knows who has seen any segments of this series on the NFL Network, these seasonal racaps keading to superbowl successes are 4-star quality.  The insight contained within the series provides the backdrop for the excitement that leads to every superbowl season.
This set is essential for Patriots fans and will have you considering purchasing other team sets just for the great insight that can complement memories we have of all these games, players and seasons. Don't waste any time waiting to own this set!",1193443200,7,517,5.011627906976744

2875888,1,B000RW3Z0I,"I'm not giving this one star to just to make a point.  I'm giving it one star because these DVD's are mostly interviews about the games, there is NOT much footage of actual game play.  Dissapointing.",1425513600,,199,4.5
2875889,4,B000RW3Z0I,when I got it I was impressed with the last two disks but the one from the patriots first super bowl victory  the disk had problems it kept freezing and it seemed like it wanted to skip in certain area's,1424649600,,203,4.075

2875892,4,B000RW3Z0I,"NFL America's Game: New England Patriots was a big hit with my 12 year old grandson Rockie.  He loves the Patriots and Tom Brady.  We cannot figure out why, as we are all New York Giants and New York Jets fans but, for him, I would purchase anything, even the opposition.

He really enjoyed the video and watches it over from time to time.",1390867200,,339,4.265625
2875893,5,B000RW3Z0I,It was great to relive the New England Patriots' road to each of their Super Bowls.  Hope Brady gets some more Super Bowl wins before he hangs it up for good.,1388966400,,158,4.096774193548387
2875894,4,B000RW3Z0I,"I ordered this compilation with great anticipation because I love watching the Patriots! It was quite
a let down to realize that these DVD's are not the actual games but rather mostly interviews with
players and coaches plus highlights. I know from reading many readers comments on Amazon that
""I should have realized"" what these videos are not but, frankly, the descriptions are somewhat vague.
The description should state that these videos ARE NOT complete games. The problem (my opinion)
is with the NFL which will not release videos of complete Superbowl games. WHY NOT???
Anyway, these particular videos are fun but leave me wanting more NE Patriot's Superbowl football...a lot more!!!",1388620800,3,691,5.178571428571429

2875898,5,B000RW3Z0I,Nothing beats going back and watching the dynasty unfold an the legend of New England's dominance in the world of football. It did however make me miss Rodney Harrison and Teddy Bruschi.,1359417600,,186,4.84375
2875899,5,B000RW3Z0I,"All of these ""America's Game"" series are absolutely spectacular.  I've purchased several sets (Giants, 49ers, Broncos, etc) and every single one has been simply outstanding.  NFL Network does a great job with all their stuff, but this series definitely tops the cake!",1325289600,,267,5.333333333333333

Wish it had more footage from the regaular/playoff games and some more player interviews.",1315440000,,149,5.0
2875901,5,B000RW3Z0I,"The NFL Films ""America's Game"" series is so well done you can almost watch an episode on any team's Superbowl victory and thoroughly enjoy it, even if it's not the team you root for.  As a Pats fan however, having a single DVD set of all 3 Superbowl victory episodes is a MUST HAVE (you will get chills by the end of the first episode covering 9/11, the Beldsoe/Brady transition and their first Superbowl win...guaranteed).  And if you have kids who were young at the time the Pats had this 3 victory run, you'll find the kids will be very drawn to these.  My kids (7 and 10 years old now) have watched these episodes on their own dozens of times and with their friends etc.  Get em, keep em and enjoy em for years to come.",1302480000,6,723,4.255474452554744
2875902,5,B000RW3Z0I,I am a die-hard New England Patriots fan and this was just a must have. This set includes America's Game for each of New England's 3 Super Bowl victories.

All the footage used is excellent and the NFL films music is composed to perfection. This is a must own for any New England Patriots or NFL fan.,1289001600,4,436,4.531645569620253
