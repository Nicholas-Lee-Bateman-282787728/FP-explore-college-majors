2636717,5,B000HEWEGM,"The concept behind this unique DVD from Women's Health is to provide different workout options for different body types.  There is a weekly schedule of pre-assembled complete workouts for three different body types, Classic Curvy, Athletic Build, or Long and Lean.  Although the routines for each type utilize the same workout segments, they are combined differently according to type (e.g., the Curvy rotation includes three days of cardio, whereas the Athletic rotation contains more strength work).  The individual workout segments are as follows:

Warm-Up, 4 minutes
Cardio, 22 minutes
Upper Body, 12 minutes
Lower Body, 13 minutes
Abs & Core, 9 minutes
Cool-Down, 6 minutes

There are also three ""Amp It Up"" segments that can be used as optional add-ons:

Kick-It, 5 minutes (kickboxing drills)
Super Slow, 5 minutes (slow weight lifting)
Power Flow, 7 minutes (flowing yoga and core work)

In addition to using the three pre-programmed workouts (which allow you simply to select the day and go), you can also create you own, fully customized routines by mixing and match any of the above individual segments.  The cardio in particular is very challenging:  although it is short, it is high-intensity, high-impact.  It is presented in four rounds, which each round consisting of three 30-second intense intervals and then a single 30-second recovery interval.  Brief jogs are used to facilitate the quick transitions between intervals, and each round is performed twice total.  Instructor Jessica Smith works out with two background exercisers who show easier and more difficult modifications for most of the moves.

I would definitely recommend this video to anyone looking to purchase a single fitness DVD with a wide variety of options.  Although easier modifications are shown, most of the segments are quite challenging, and therefore I would not recommend this video for beginners.  On the other hand, there is no heavy weight lifting either (Jessica recommends 3-5 lbs., although I went heavier for most of the exercises), so more advanced exercisers may be a bit disappointed.  However, I think this video is perfect for those at an intermediate level like myself; you will work hard and just might enhance your body type in the process!",1176681600,117,2250,5.225626740947075
2636718,5,B000HEWEGM,"I love the variety of this workout, and the fact that I can modify the segments to my liking. The moderator's voice is not annoying and the two helping her are in sync throughout the video. Great workout!!",1173657600,5,205,4.421052631578948
2636719,5,B000HEWEGM,"I like this video for the routine. I work out at 5 a.m., and I don't always want to have to think about my exercise. Use this as part of an exercise library, and you won't be sorry. Another plus, low impact option. I cannot do all of the kickboxing, bouncing, jumping, squatting moves of other videos, and I appreciate this program for having three people performing all three options: high, regular, and low impact. Easy moves, easy to follow with countdown clock.",1172620800,14,465,4.614457831325301
2636720,2,B000HEWEGM,"I like the custom programming of this dvd, but that is where my appreication for it ends.  The moves are BORING!  Its basically just variations of jumping up and down.  Its an intense workout, but its hard to stay motivated.",1171497600,13,224,4.55
2636721,5,B000HEWEGM,I love the diverse exercises from kickboxing to pilates blend. All levels are performed here.  My favorite moves are core moves such as the backward bicycle and the standing hundred. One will never get bored with the DVD's exercise selections. Top notch production quality and a super value for your money!!,1169942400,6,307,5.019607843137255
2636722,5,B000HEWEGM,"I ordered this DVD based upon two recommendations, which I was a little skeptical about.  It was so pleasantly surprised, this is a really nice DVD!  Although an avid home workout person for many years, I have always kind of wondered what the correct ""mix"" is for my body type - this is it!  It has daily pre-programmed workouts for athletic, curvy and lean body types which makes it a no-brainer.  But, you can also create your own custom workout as this is one of those matrix-type DVDs.  I found the DVD to be well produced, the instructor was pleasant, chatty, but not annoying at all and did a great job cueing and making sure you don't hurt yourself.  I like it and recommend it to anyone looking to mix it up a bit and not have to put too much thought into, ""what do I do today?"".  I probably won't follow this to a ""t"", but I found this to be a surprise and something not easily found (I'm not sure how I found it on Amazon.com).  I feel anyone from beginner to advanced will benefit from this, it's straight-forward but still challenging.  Enjoy!",1168646400,25,1055,4.369230769230769
2636723,5,B000HEWEGM,"I found this to be a GREAT workout video. I usually do Turbo Jam, so I love high intensity workouts. This defiantly makes me sweat and get fatigued. I wasn't sure about it because the cover didn't say much about it. Boy, am I glad I got it. I just thought I'd write a review about it so others had more info about it. Overall, I am very impressed!

2636724,5,B000HEWEGM,"This is one of those fun, new programmable DVDs where you can mix and match the exercises in the order you want, and even do the same segment more than once. You can customize your workout from the warm-up (4 minutes), upper body (12 minutes), lower body (13 minutes), abs & core (9 minutes), cardio (22 minutes) and cool-down (6 minutes) Several of the lower body and abs & core moves come from Pilates (i.e., leg circles, double leg stretch.)  The cardio was much more intense than the other Women's Health DVD - the Wedding Workout.  The pre-programs include ""Curvy Bodies"" which suggests 3 days of cardio, 1 of upper body, 1 of lower body, and 1 of abs & core; ""Lean Bodies"" which suggests 1 day of cardio, 2 days of upper body, 2 days of lower body, and 1 day of abs & core, and ""Athletic Bodies"" which suggests 1 day of upper body, 1 day of lower body, 2 days of cardio, and 1 day of abs & core.  The bonus segments include tips on meals and nutrition.  While I didn't enjoy the cardio as much as I did the WW DVD, I just modified some of the higher impact moves; I'll keep this for the strength work for sure!",1165622400,48,1116,4.225352112676056
2636745,4,B000HEWEGM,"I bought this dvd a little over a month ago and I've really enjoyed it so far. You get to choose from 3 different body types so I chose classic curvy and that's what this review is about. The cardio section is great especially if you are short on time, I think it's 32 minutes and thats including warmup, workout and cool off. There are four intervals that you do twice on M, W, F then upper body on T,  lower body on Th, abs on Sat and rest Sun. I would not suggest this dvd for  people who are intermediate or advanced bc the upper, lower body and core is way too easy and I'm saying this as a beginner. I now use Kelly Coffey-Meyer 30 minutes to fitness split session bc the upper and lower body on this dvd is only maybe 12-14 minutes. Lastly if you have knee issues be very careful bc you will be doing a variation of squats and lunges daily (they are in the warmup and workout part.) Overall this is a great dvd bc everything is mapped out for you on one dvd.",1416355200,6,965,4.047120418848167
2636746,3,B000HEWEGM,"I""m picky about my workout dvds. I get really bored easily. This one did not have the pep nor motivation to keep me going through the whole workout.",1415836800,2,148,4.321428571428571

2636749,2,B000HEWEGM,"Not for me.  I have 3 of Jessica's walking-based DVDs and love them although they are challenging.  This one was something I could have done 30 years ago but not now that I'm in my 50s and my knees are starting to go.  One of the two other people on the DVD does the low impact version but it was still way too much for me.  I intended to do the cardio section and then the upper body but had to quit after mostly doing the cardio.  In some places I just stopped trying to do what they were doing and just walked.  You can program the sections in whatever order you like and there's are warm-up and cool-down sections so I liked that function.  If you're pretty fit and don't have joint problems, this would be a good workout but if you do have joint problems, I suggest the walking DVDs that Jessica does.",1411430400,3,806,4.161290322580645
2636750,5,B000HEWEGM,"This program includes everything you need to exercise every area of your body, including strength-training the upper and lower, plus cardio and stretching. I like the three different ""actors"" who demonstrate three levels: regular, beginner and advanced. The segments are short enough so I never feel overwhelmed--you can do as much or as little as you want to do, depending on the time you have available. Plus, you can create an individual workout for each day of the week. I really recommend this workout.",1403049600,3,507,5.0476190476190474
2636751,4,B000HEWEGM,"I like that you can select the work you want with this DVD, so every day can be a little different. There are different categories to choose from such as arm, legs, and cardio.  They also show an easier and harder version of most exercises, so people of any fitness level can use it.  One of my favorite workout DVDs.",1402185600,,317,4.266666666666667
2636752,4,B000HEWEGM,"I got this DVD because I'm a fan of Jessica Smith (the instructor) and know she can be deceptively difficult.  I ignored the pre-programmed choice and built my own work out.  There is a warm up, cardio, strength, amped up sections and cool down to choose from.  I did wu, cardio, amp up kick and cd one day and wu, strength, amp up abs, and cd another.  There is also an amp up yoga which is nice for a short quick yoga workout.
I like the fact that you can mix and match, there is a nice interactive menu for you to choose not only which portion you want to do but which order you would like to do them in.  There is a slight pause between each selection but it is only a few seconds.  I'm an intermediate exerciser, not young any more but in decent shape and found both the cardio and strength portions challenging but not un-doable.  The amp up selections are short little 7 to 10 min. mini-workouts that are a bit more intense than the regular workout.  All were challenging enough but the yoga portion is one that should be watched first since it is a fast flow and would be difficult to follow if you didn't know which pose she was going to go to next.
All in all I found this a good workout and felt both the cardio and the strength the next day.",1394928000,4,1253,4.148760330578512
2636753,3,B000HEWEGM,"These workouts are not very difficult.  Not very long either.  ""If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you"" probably not great for long term use.",1393718400,,153,4.846153846153846
2636754,4,B000HEWEGM,I was pleased with this DVD!!!! It had what I was looking for and it shows you how to train for your body type and get full benefit out of your workout!!!,1392681600,,154,3.84375
2636765,5,B000HEWEGM,"I had this DVD a couple of years ago and I somehow lost it. I looked EVERYWHERE for this DVD and finally found it on Amazon. The DVD Is great because you can customize your own workout. Item showed up exactly as described, and FAST!",1388880000,,232,4.177777777777778

2636767,5,B000HEWEGM,"I like this workout video!  You get to pick what part of your body you want to work out, which is nice and the program is slower but pushes you.  I love the stretching section.",1375920000,,176,4.0

2636769,3,B000HEWEGM,"If you're a beginner, this is a very good starter DVD.  I would rank myself more towards intermediate, so it is not the best fit for me.  This DVD incorporates cardio, resistance, core training, and gives you a basic schedule to follow.  My favorite part of this workout is the cardio, and Jessica provides a very nice warm up and cool down that I have used in conjunction with other DVDs lacking in that department.  I didn't find the core portion to be very effective for me, but I do think it was better than doing nothing.  Overall, I prefer 10 Pounds Down, Better Body Blast also starring Jessica Smith (although I have been using the warm up and cool down from this DVD in addition to the 10 Pounds Down, as I feel Jessica skimps a bit, particularly on the cool down/stretching).  That DVD contains moves similar to the upper and lower body workouts in this one, with some additional movements that I find more challenging.  I lost 20 pounds by using that DVD alone.  I will keep this DVD in my rotation, but it's not my favorite.",1374537600,5,1036,4.444444444444445
2636770,3,B000HEWEGM,"I like Jessica and I really like Madison (the lighter-level girl), so that's good to watch and learn from people who are doing it right. the exercises are more challenging for me than the wedding workout (my favorite workout video) and one exercise is held longer than I would like. Instead of counting to 8, I feel like it is counting to 16 or 32.",1364601600,,348,4.369230769230769
2636771,5,B000HEWEGM,"I use this DVD almost every morning (out of a selection of about 25 others!). It's got a customizable playlist, so you can work the parts you want and in the time you have. The moves are simple, but innovative enough not to bore you to death, and there are harder and easier options. Jessica Smith is the perfect morning workout partner in that she's straight-forward (no corny jokes or over-the-top enthusiasm) and has a killer body to keep me inspired. I have even started to take this one with me when I travel. All you need are a set of 5-8lb weights, and some workouts don't even require that. Highly recommend this one. My fave of the Women's Health series so far.",1360108800,4,670,4.455284552845528
2636772,5,B000HEWEGM,"This workout is one of my favorites.  I don't do the ""for you're body type pre-programmed workouts"".  I self programs based on how much time I have.  I always do the cardio segment and find it to be consistently challenging and fun.  I've done the arm and leg segments too as well as the kickboxing short blast and the yoga short blast.  All are excellent!  I love all of Jessica smith's dvd's and this one does not disappoint. Only thing I don't love is that I've seen the women in her video as backups in other videos and that bugs me for some inexplicable reason.  I guess I have the delusion they actually are work out together, rather than just paid to be in whatever workout du jour.  Nothing I can't get over :).",1354406400,,719,4.313432835820896

2636774,3,B000HEWEGM,"This might actually be a good video for a younger person or anyone that doesn't have one bad knee and one worse one. Altough it is tagged as low impact the quick sharp moves were too much for my knees. I gave this away and hope they will use it in good health.

Maybe there needs to be an additional rating Low Impact-Decrepit",1315612800,3,326,4.174603174603175

You can do all the segments or just choose which ones you can do depending on time. But all the segments are great. I find myself going back to working out with Jessica again and again, and I do have quite a selection of workout DVDs. The cardio is intense and the strength training is effective. It's a great combination of cardio and strength. It even has a yoga/stretch segment. Thank you Women's Health!",1313280000,2,512,4.23469387755102
2636777,3,B000HEWEGM,"I had trouble getting into this DVD. I liked the idea, pre-set workouts for your body type, but I guess I didn't realize that it was a weekly schedule, with you doing one workout each day. I have a hard time believing someone serious about getting in shape is going to waste their daily workout on a 7 minute upper body routine.

I scrapped the idea of following the schedule and just customized my own workout. I still had difficulty with the routine. Each time a new segment begins, there's a little intro, Jessica introduces herself and the girls... I don't like that. I want to keep moving, not break for an intro every 10 minutes.

Overall, I enjoyed the workout itself, but I wish the segments flowed together better....",1306281600,6,726,4.576923076923077
2636778,5,B000HEWEGM,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

The instructor is actually a bit ""perkier"" than I usually like since I prefer more serious, non-smiley instructors but she works for me and I now have quite a few workouts by her.

This workout covers the entire body and is challenging enough to work up a serious sweat but not a problem for me to keep up with.  I like all of the routines offered (quite a large selection) and prefer to mix and match on my own (which kind of defeats the whole premise this DVD is trying to promote with matching routines to body type.)

2636780,2,B000HEWEGM,"I hurt my knee!  Never have I done a workout video in the past where right in the middle of a section I get a shooting pain through my left knee!  I've done plenty of videos and reviewed a handful on Amazon.  I have mentioned that in the past I had an ankle issue that I was working through and the beginning signs of carpal tunnel from years of working in physical therapy (the sad part is that I'm not that old - at all!), but other than minor things I've never experienced a shooting pain (or much of any pain) in my knee(s) while working out until the cardio section of this video!  There is a lot of jumping and twisting and some lunges, but normally that wouldn't bother me.  I wanted to do a total body workout so I did all the sections alternating between the amp it ups and the toning.  Unfortunately, I went from the warm up right into the cardio portion and that's where I hurt my knee.  I did all of the other sections except the lower body (didn't want to put the strain on my knee) and the slow amp it up section and the rest was alright.  I was pleased that there were no push ups because those always bother my wrists.  The ""yoga"" section was a little hard on them but manageable.  I'm just bummed about the knee thing.  I'll take a couple of days off and I should be alright, but I can't give this any more than two stars because of the injury.  I do like that you can customize your workout (even though that seems to come standard with many workouts now), but I found the instructor to be fairly boring.  I didn't think she was all that motivating and actually, she was pretty bland.  It gets 1 star for the customizing part and 1 star for not relying on push ups.  It loses a star because of the instructor and 2 because I was injured.",1291334400,3,1755,4.150887573964497

the instructor is energetic without being annoying, I like that you can customize your routine and mix it up a little. The cardio was a little lacking, but when paired with the kickboxing add in... it wiped me out.

It's perfect, especially in the winter months when I can't get outdoors. I'll be using the upper and core workouts in the summer months when I can't get out for a jog

A+ !

I like that this DVD has nice warm up and cool down segments. I have bad knees and feet, so it is terrific that there is a person in the video doing a low-impact version.",1265673600,,437,3.9101123595505616

It's one of my more intense workout DVDs and I always feel so invigorated and limber upon completing it.  I really love it and I can't recommend it highly enough.  You will definitely get an excellent workout.  I like the fact that there are so many options to choose from.  You could just do a warm-up, the cardio and then cool down (which is about 30 minutes) or you could do the ""Amp it Up"" section (adds about 5 minutes) and really amp up your workout.  Either way, you will be breathing hard and sweating.  Just a warning:  there is definitely a lot of jumping so if you have weak knees, you might want to stick with the low-impact modifications (there are advanced modifications too if you feel like challenging yourself).  Jessica Smith cues wonderfully and you can tell she is well trained.  She is upbeat but not over the top.  She is encouraging but not patronizing.  She includes moves that I have not seen in any other workout DVD (at least not those in my collection) and because I love yoga, the Amp it Up PowerFlow section (a short but strong combination of power yoga and pilates moves) seals the deal for me.

Overall, it's a creative and fun workout.  Definitely 5 stars.",1253145600,2,1278,4.429184549356223
2636796,5,B000HEWEGM,"I love all of the Women's Health workouts (I own them all), but this one is fantastic.  You're supposed to do the various different segments on different days to train for certain body types, but I usually do all the segments at once, because they are a fantastic total body workout when done together.  Every segment impressed me, and was obviously designed to be as effective as possible.  You will need some light weights (2-5 pounds) and a mat for this workout.

The good:

--The cardio segment (about 22 minutes) is FABULOUS!  It's done in 4 ""rounds"" (circuits, really), and you do each circuit twice.  The exercises in each round are varied in intensity.  Inbetween each exercise you are jogging, so you are constantly keeping your heart rate up.  This is one of the few cardio segments from a magazine workout that I have that truly gets my heart rate up to 70-80% of maximum and keeps it in that range the entire time.
--The toning segments (upper body, lower body, and abs) are all great, too--very effective moves.
--All the moves are very simple and require little coordination to follow them; however they are very effective!
--High and low impact options/modifications are shown for each exercise.

Needs improvement:

--I wished the toning segments could have been a little longer (they run about 11-12 minutes each)
--Jessica Smith is a good instructor, but is a little ""wooden.""

The good outweighs the bad here; This is an excellently designed workout that a beginner (using modifications) or an advanced exerciser would enjoy.  It is challenging, and it will push you (especially the cardio!).  A great buy for your money!",1243382400,2,1640,4.873646209386282
2636797,4,B000HEWEGM,The cardio is intense...but good.  All of the segments are good.  My only wish is that they included workouts for more body types...they have 3...I do believe there needs to be a bit more explanation and variety.  I didn't see a body type that accurately described me...I am somewhere between 2 of them (my only gripe).,1242259200,,319,4.660714285714286
2636798,3,B000HEWEGM,The video is alright.  It's not what I expected.  Maybe because I'm used to more upbeat instructors.  I did the workout yesterday and had to follow it up with another video because I didn't feel like I got a workout.,1239667200,,216,4.35
2636799,3,B000HEWEGM,"This is a surprisingly versatile workout DVD and it can be customized almost endlessly.  Other reviewers have already done a great job detailing what you're in for with this workout, and I don't have anything to add.

My issue with this DVD, why I did not give it four stars that it should have, is that if you aren't sure of which body type you are, vis-a-vis this DVD, the instructor invites you to go to Women's Health Magazine's website and take their quiz.  Since the production of this workout DVD, Women's Health Magazine has re-done their website, and there is no quiz anymore, or if it's there, it's impossible to find.  This is not to say your success with this workout DVD hinges on a quiz you can't find to take, but if Women's Health is going to put out workout DVDs and advertise things on their website that are to be used as tools with the DVDs, they should keep these things on their website for longer than a year or so, in case someone buys this DVD a few years later.

Other than this issue, this is a very good workout, especially if you're just getting started!",1237852800,3,1083,4.395

But everyday after it started getting easier and easier.  It's a really good workout everytime, and you get to choose either by body type or the different workouts (cardio, upper body, lower body, ect. . .).  Definetly a keeper workout DVD!!",1215993600,2,414,4.694444444444445

I am not a big fan of the cardio portion though, she moves a little too fast for all the jumping that is done. If you do not have good form while doing this portion of the workout it puts a lot of strain on the ankles and feet. Also I wasn't a big fan of the instructor, I much prefer Amy Dixon on some of the other WH videos.",1213920000,,417,3.75
2636816,5,B000HEWEGM,"I really like this DVD.  I find that it is easy to stay motivated with it -- I have no problem forcing myself to do this 6 days a week.  The cardo is difficult but that is what I like about it.  I love the instructor - I wish she had more DVDs.  My only mild complaint is that I wish the arms segment was more challenging.  I am mildly sore the next day but I think I will outgrow this segment very fast.  I love the abs section.  I've never seen my abs get in shape faster and I was surprised because this was one of the shortest work outs.  Overall, though, I'd buy this for its cardo, which, based on my body type, I am supposed to do 3 times a week.",1208131200,3,653,3.8208955223880596
2636817,5,B000HEWEGM,"I love this DVD!  I own about 25 or so workout DVDs and after using this one for a few days it is now one of my favorites.  I've really been impressed with the Women's Health work out DVDs.  I own this ""Train for your Body Type"" and the ""Wedding Workout"" DVD.  They're both customizable, so you can pick which sections you want to work on each day (for this video, cardio and abs or just legs and arms, etc).  The cardio section is high intensity and only 22 minutes so it is perfect for those of us that have hectic work and/or home schedules (beginning exercisers may find it pretty tough however and will need to follow the modifier).  You get a very solid cardio workout in a short period of time (there is lots of jumping so for those with bad knees you'd like have to follow the low intensity version).  The weight sections of this workout also use innovative techniques to hit multiple muscles at once, allowing you to work out more efficiently.  There are even mini sections of 5-7 minutes that feature either cardio bursts, yoga/pilates, or a heavy weight lifting section if you're looking to add a little variety to your work out.

The ""train for your body type"" aspect is addressed by the DVD allowing you to select one of three body type workout options ""curvy,"" ""long and lean,"" or ""athletic.""  Based on the body type you select the DVD will give you a seven day workout plan (alternating cardio, lower body, abs, etc. throughout each day).  Of course you don't have the follow the plan laid out and can do any section of the DVD you please on any given day.

This really is a solid workout DVD, and from what I've seen of other Women's Health DVD reviews the entire line is quality.  In fact, I'm about to purchase the other WH DVDs that I don't currently own!",1207094400,7,1774,4.404907975460123
2636818,5,B000HEWEGM,"I am a big fan of customizable DVD's and this is as convienent as the come.  The workouts (Cardio, Upper/Lower Body, Warmup/Cool down etc.) are all listed with the time devoted to each section.  If you want, you can do a warm up and 2 cardio's in a row (44 minutes) or do a cardio and upper body only or all strength with a few Amps.  The Amps are 5 minutes workouts that give you something a little different and interesting. They include yoga, slow move cardio and cardio kicks. They are fun to tack on to the end of a strength only day.
I take this one with my on my vacations because it has everything that I need on one DVD.
Almost forgot, there are preset workouts based on your shape.  I haven't done them because I use the custom feature.
All in All A+ for this DVD.",1205280000,4,774,4.14

I know I need to do cardio, but I don't like cardio workouts w/lots of jumping or repeating the same thing over & over.  I like that the cardio portion of this DVD has short bursts of high-intensity intervals followed by lower intensity transition moves & recovery periods because of this I don't mind the jumping that is involved.  The few things that I think could've made this DVD better would be 2 different cardio sections rather than just one & a longer ab/core workout.  I had hit a rut w/my current routine & this DVD helped get me out of that rut.",1204675200,5,675,4.325396825396825
2636820,4,B000HEWEGM,"This video's cardio section is great, all the other workouts and the hype about workouts for your body type are not really worth it, but the cardio section is an amazing addition to your workout. just note that there is a lot of bouncing and jumping around so if you have bad knees or feet it's probably not the workout for you. The instructor is great too, she doesnt go too fast and isn't so irritating you turn the video off in 5 minutes like ALL of the firm videos. If you are like me and aren't highly coordinated skip the firm-they go too fast with too complicated of moves, but this womens health video is easy to follow and will definately work off calories-- I only gave it 4 stars because the rest of the workouts on the tape aren't worth it.",1204070400,6,752,4.265734265734266

What a wonderful concept!! The exercises are challenging and the instructors are motivating without being annoying.  The dvd fitness industry should take notice of this ""customizable approach"" to exercise; because, as we all know, the same boring exercise routine gets old very quickly after only a few viewings by the user.

As a very athletic/lean person I found the cardio portion to be very heart plumping (and that is saying alot), not to the point to make you faint, but gives you a sweat none the less.

The abs portion I would have to say is very elementary for an advance exerciser, but if you are a beginner this would certainly be a good start.

The lower/upper body portion was very nice, but they recommend 2-5 pound dumbbells which I say, if you are advance add more weights to it.

The DVD overall is very good, but the workouts can get boring very fast and doesn't give you the motivation to pick it up again, but the workouts are very effective and I would say give this DVD a try.",1187481600,3,914,4.235632183908046

2636831,5,B000HEWEGM,I just recently received this DVD and have tried the workouts.  The Cardio is a little ho-hum but the weight training is right on track.  I use the cardio portion when I am home and cannot get to the gym for a treadmill run or on the elliptical since I need to do at least 45 min of cardio.  Good DVD for women who want to weight train.,1183939200,2,336,3.911764705882353
2636832,5,B000HEWEGM,"This DVD has a few of things that I think EVERY workout DVD should have:

* Modifications for beginner, intermediate and advanced exercisers

* Strength training always involving weights.  (By showing you how to incorporate weights in to each exercise, it truly makes the workout useable for people at all fitness levels.  And it's one you can continue with as you become more fit and strong, just by increasing that weight!)

* Programability!  My schedule changes from day to day, and I love the flexibility of working out for 25 minutes or 60 minutes or whatever works best for me!

This morning I did a warm up, the upper body section, the lower body section and a cool down (about 25 mins) and was pleasantly surprised at how tired my muscles felt afterward.  I haven't felt that kind of fatigue from a video in some time.

I am a little confused by the countdown clock that shows up on the screen at random times.  I understand it's counting down to the end of a set, but it isn't displayed consistently and is kind of distracting.

Overall, I highly recommend this one and plan to add it to my regular rotation.",1180569600,7,1118,4.54

8139313,4,B000HEWEGM,"I actually really enjoyed this workout dvd for what it was. The only reason I'm rating it 3.5 stars as opposed to 5 stars is that it wasn't necessary a good choice for ME, intensity-wise. Others have already broken down the exact segments so I won't do that as well. Before deciding to buy this DVD, I scoured the reviews trying to figure out what sort of intensity and workout to expect so my review is going to be about that. I'm just going to rate the workout as I perceived it, as someone of intermediate to advanced fitness (run sub-30-min 5ks, completed Insanity). I think this video is best for beginner to intermediate level exercisers but can of course be used by anyone.

As has already been said, this dvd is incredibly customizable. Sure, there is a daily workout schedule for the 3 different body types outlined in this video (lean, curvy and athletic), and you can follow that schedule if you choose BUT unless you're a real beginner, very new to exercise, the workouts on their own are in my opinion VERY (almost TOO) easy to be broken down piecemeal into doing just upper body one day and just lower body the next. This is fine as the customizable matrix means you can combine your workouts in any way you choose. I for example, will do Upper Body, Lower Body and maybe Cardio or some of the Amp It Up sessions as a combo to get a moderate work out.

I've sort of fallen for Jessica Smith as a trainer after this video. I've been aware of her for some time and have a couple of her 10-minute solutions dvds but this DVD has turned me into a fan that now follows her on YouTube (where by the way she posts free exercise videos) and social media. Jessica Smith is one of the realest, most genuine-seeming video trainers I've encountered. She's not too bubbly or silly or too militant or bland or awkward, she seems like someone who you'd take a real fitness class with in real life- she doesn't try too hard to impress and mixes being friendly with being business like. Somehow, her workouts fly by and maybe because they're really easy to follow and seem very easy, before you know it, you've been working out for an hour whereas you only planned to do 20 minutes initially. Another good thing about this dvd is that there's room to make them more intense and the intensity can sneak up on you in a surprising way. I wouldn't call this a particularly high impact workout. In the cardio section, there's a bit of jumping, but if you've done a Jillian Michael's video before, the low-impact modifications in those videos are higher impact than Jessica Smith's high intensity versions in this TFYBT.

I use this DVD on easier days when I don't feel like exercising but am forcing myself to get a workout in or when I'm tired or sore or wanting to workout in the evenings before bed which is often not too long after dinner. It's easy enough that you're never intimidated by the idea of it, but you can also get a fair calorie burn out of it. I know many hold the calorie trackers in HRMs in great suspicion but for those who don't, the sorts of calorie burns I get from doing this DVD are anywhere from 315 calories in 44 minutes (for the Warm Up, Upper Body, Lower Body, Kick It Up (Amp it Up) and Cool Down) to 462 calories in 63 minutes when I include then Cardio to the previously described session. Doing just the Upper Body, Lower Body and Cool Down segments, I burn about 222 calories according to my Polar, which I think is pretty good for a 31-minute strength training work out.

All in all, I really actually like this workout. I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be tougher than it is, but it's a good workout. If you're a cardioholic like me, it's a good way to get more into strength training. Jessica recommends 3-5 lb dumbells for the workouts but I use 7-10 lb ones and there's nothing stopping you from going heavier as you get stronger. Most of the video requires no equipment. The Amp it Up sections in my opinion ""amp"" NOTHING up, but they're a nice little add-on to keep on moving if you're not yet tired or to get some extra stretch in. This video is a slow burner. It's quiet and nothing that will blow you away with excitement but it's at the same time enjoyable and one of those that will never feel like a chore or a task to complete.",1417564800,5,4291,4.386934673366834
