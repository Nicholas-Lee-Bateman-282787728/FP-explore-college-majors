8398794,2,B003KM4CKE,"The title is right, it is just the facts but it is also just plain boring.  I tried to use this video for a criminal justice class on courts and it was a snooze fest!  Yes, it had some good info but was delivered in a monotone fact and picture way that made the students stare blankly.  I did like how it went over in plain terms details of the supreme court through the course of history but GEEEEZ, even I wanted to fall asleep!  I would recommend maybe using the video with a lesson plan in a start/stop type.  Do lecture and activities then use the video to drive home a point in 2 min increments.  The hard part will be that it does not have a scene selector so you will need a program to cut and take what you want.",1317427200,,721,4.006993006993007
