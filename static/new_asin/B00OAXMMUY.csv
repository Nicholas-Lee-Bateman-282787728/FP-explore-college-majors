No wonder I had not forgotten this movie, even if I could not remember the plot. It is definitely not a serious drama, for it mixes a touch of camp and humor in a story that borders on horror and science-fiction, played with gusto by everybody, especially Lauren Bacall as a wicked psychiatrist. On the other hand, if you approach it as a straight psychological drama, you will find that scriptwriter Sydney Boehm was quite sincere and treated the ""psychic elements"" of the story with all the respect you could expect in 1964, to add as much realism and credibility as he could to  such a wacky tale. Everybody in the cast seems to be having a field day: Stuart Whitman was in his best years doing his usual hunk hero number, Roddy McDowall was quite effective as a psycho killer with loads of homoerotic sensibility, Carol Lynley has more than enough screen time to portray a troubled girl whose natural sensuality was repressed by her mother, and Bacall is wonderfully mean as the highly unethical head of a mental hospital. Director Denis Sanders had a very curious career: he did everything, from bee girls' horror to documentaries about Elvis Presley and soul music, and the compelling war drama ""War Hunt"" with John Saxon as a schizophrenic soldier, plus two works that have been declared National Film Registry by the US Congress: the moving Civil War short ""A Time Out of War"" and the documentary ""Czechoslovakia 1968"". Here he is also in good shape, effectively handling the story and immensely helped by Sam Leavitt's beautiful black & white / wide-screen cinematography. Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked in ""Freud"" in 1962, composed another good score for ""mental matters"". In fact, 1964 was an excellent year for Goldsmith, who also wrote great dramatic music for ""Rio Conchos"" and ""Fate Is the Hunter"". If you do not sit waiting for a masterpiece, turn off the lights, ignore your cell phone and take it as fun, as a tale of greed and nutty plans, with fantasy solutions played by good actors, and you will probably enjoy ""Shock Treatment"" as much as I did.",1480636800,,2412,4.688679245283019
