3522926,4,B001D2WUAM,Kat Williams had me on the floor laughing...he is hilarious and I just love his sense of humor. This is a definite Holiday buy for the family that loves comedy. You will not be disapointed. Thanks!!!,1229040000,,199,4.555555555555555
3522927,3,B001D2WUAM,"To me this dvd was too explicit.  It's funny to watch if you like this type of stuff, but if you have children or anyone around you that you actually respect you will not want to watch this movie.  He is truly a comedian and this dvd was really funny, but too explicit.  It's your choice if you want to purchase this.  I rented it and I'm happy I did not purchase this.",1228780800,3,369,4.013698630136986
3522928,2,B001D2WUAM,"... or just Netflix it. This was pretty disappointing. Im a big Katt Williams fan based on his other 3 DVDs... and this one is clearly the worst of the bunch. Katt is trying to project an uplifting message throughout the entire set rather than individual jokes; which is what made The Pimp Chronicles and American Hustle so great.

He seems to blab for the ENTIRE set, not even giving the audience time to laugh. A few things were funny, but I wasn't laughing out loud like Pimp Chronicles or American Hustle. Fairly tame content too coming from him. You could almost show this set on daytime cable.

If you plan to buy this for X-mas, do whoever your buying this for a favor and get any of his other DVDs.",1228348800,2,706,4.3816793893129775
3522929,4,B001D2WUAM,If you liked The Pimp Chronicles then you'll love It's Pimpin' Pimpin'.  Live in DC with today's topics.,1227916800,,104,4.777777777777778
3522930,5,B001D2WUAM,"I thought that Katt was as amazingly clever as usual in this new release. I pre-ordered it and me and my girlfriends watched it on Saturday night. Unfortunately I live in a building in South Florida with alot of old people. We laughed so hard and loud during the entire Blu Ray disc, that one of my neighbors told the security guard to come tell us to be quiet because he was trying to sleep. Even after the security guard left we were still falling over laughing with tears down our faces. If you love Katt, or if you love humor that pokes fun at (while at the same time celebrating) race, sex, and politics, then this Blu Ray is a must have for any collection. In this DVD, Katt discusses the Olympic winner who was disqualified for running on prosthetic legs (Oscar Pistorius), the election, Obama, Mccain, Hillary Clinton, and a news story about some guys being attacked by a tiger in a California zoo in April 2008 amongst other things. I thought it was really interesting the way Katt approached each issue and spoke of the irony in each situation and made it funny even though the stories he discussed were tragic.",1227657600,15,1121,4.5
3522931,4,B001D2WUAM,"I was in the 5th row when this was filmed and of course I'm still looking very closely for EXTRA footage. Anyhow, the more I view it from reading from reviewer's perspective, the more I appreciate it in retrospect. I had seen various portions of it prior to the DVD on YouTube thanks to uploaders from across the 100 city tour. So by the time I purchased my ticket day of the show, I figured I would know the whole show in full. What surprised me seeing the entire routine in full start to finish was not as funny THAT day. But now seeing the promo releases, reading various commentary from all levels of perception, it's funnier than it could ever be.

The material is very relevant to what we are experiencing as people. Reading many, many Blogs, Katt is quoted almost on every line, no catch phrase from every DVD he's released. Getting in tune with your ""star player"" is about self esteem which a lot of folks lack - badly. Making sure your team is in tune - make sure those around you have your back as you should have theirs. Check your own house before stepping into someone else's. He even touches on how the Paralympics runner was mistreated. Katt tied all his thoughts together in this just like The Pimp Chronicles which will forever remain #1 in my collection. All topics were seemeless and flowed very well - all in accord with his animatics. He's always been a very animated and hyper individual. This adds to the humor he's bringing forth because you can just laugh at his facial expressions and/or even leap and curl around a stool (and holding on without tilting backwards/forwards) imitating a hungry lion on a wildebeast.

GET THE DVD is my final word.",1227052800,9,1671,4.529801324503311
3522932,5,B001D2WUAM,"This was a very good comedy DVD. As far as other people on here talking about him being too preachy or all over the place. No offense but you must be a little slow on the uptake, cuz he wasn't all over the place with his jokes, juat pay attention. Katt Williams always drops knowledge in his shows, once again pay attention. Another awesome performance from Katt Williams and its entirely new material from him, unlike Pimp Chronicles and American Hustle which were good performances but basically a re-hash of the material with slight differences that can be found in the Katt Williams Live DVD. I do own all of his stand up DVDs so far as well. Anyways this DVD is definately 5 stars in the perfomance and production. A definate solid buy and well worth the money.",1226793600,3,766,4.517985611510792
3522933,2,B001D2WUAM,"While I am a HUGE Katt fan this DVD was alittle disappointing. The constant repetition about the ""haters"" and looking out for yourself were annoying and were less and less funny as the show went on. The jokes/stories ARE funny but they are very few and far between in this show. Alot of good material seemed to have gone wasted and he was all over the place.

Maybe I am being too critical and expect more but Katt seems to have gone backward from the ""The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1"". Its follow-up ""American Hustle The Movie (aka Katt Williams: The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 2)"" was not as good as Pt. 1 and this DVD seems to have taken an even further step back.

Katt seems to be preaching to the audience about the ""Haters"", Stand-Up should be Stand-Up and not a personal pulpit against the ""Haters"".",1226188800,3,794,4.431506849315069
3522934,5,B001D2WUAM,"Man Katt Williams was funny as always  and made you think at the same time. But there is alway people out there who's going to  hate. So all I'm going to do is laugh at the first reviewers post. I'm glad i didn't fall for it.  Katt will explain it to you in this stand-up. The first  reviewer just didn't get it. But i bet now you do! lol

He had me and my wife  lol all night. And she is Vietnamese. His jokes where multi-tribal (explained everything so more then one person can relate to his jokes ) We are a big fan of Richard,Eddie,Red Fox,Robin Williams,Chappelle,George Carlin. So I'm glad I added katt to my collection.  So just take some time out and watch it. You will enjoy. This is my own review. But if you already know his work you will be smiling at the end of it.

He was on point about being the star player. I don't know him personal but i know the next time he in concert i won't miss it.",1226188800,13,906,4.050561797752809
3522935,2,B001D2WUAM,I have to say...Katt Williams is probably one of the funniest guys I have ever seen...but this performance has to be the most disappointing one I have seen yet.  It honestly looks like this man is on crack.  None of his jokes make sense and he is twitching all over the place.  I have no idea what happened but this was not what I wanted to see...,1226016000,2,347,4.149253731343284

Comedy where there are more ""F-bombs"" than a Richard Pryor concert! Kevin Hart is another similar one but Katt is far more raunchy.

I own and love all Katt's stand ups, and I'm tempted to say ""this one is the best"".  I'll tell you this, when this FOOL tells you about that d@@m motorcycle he bought and tried to ride...you are going to pass out!!

3523169,5,B001D2WUAM,"I'm so glad I preordered this and was on board before any of my peers. I put them on to some great comedy. I almost died from laughing so hard that I couldn't breath. And my disc has been passed from household to household.

I simply love it. Go get it if you don't have it.

I'm not a woman of many words...so I'll close with this:

Finally, I got to watch it with my friend on New Yr's Day.  I was ROLLING!!!!!  Of course, I had to buy it for myself.  I've seen it 2 or 3 times since the initial viewing & I still crack up laughing.",1238371200,2,376,3.9466666666666668

3523187,5,B001D2WUAM,"This is truly one of Katt's best dvd stand up routines.  Filmed in Washington, DC in Constitution Hall (sold out crowd), he truly delivers some of his best material to date with an authority and confidence and comedic styling that he has never shown before.  I own his first two videos, the Pimp Chronicles and American Hustler, and I can honestly say that he has the most original jokes here and the real life observations are amazing and truly funny.  From his sharp political commentary on Obama being the ""best N****a you can vote for right here, right now"", to the hilarious story about his son's reaction to taking Ritalin for his attention deficient disorder ""sometimes you got to let real sh**t happen"", he is constantly on point and hilariously entertaining and engaging from the beginning.  I have always admired his physical comedy as well; the way he slides across the stage to show how his son stopped running in mid stride because of his ritalin dose or the way he portrays the frustrations of the tigers of the san francisco zoo in their ""fake habitat"" is totally genius.  for katt williams fans, he will definitely not disappoint; in fact he takes it to the next level on a more global scale with the same homegrown round the way brotha style he always has; for a newcomer to his comedy, it's still hilarious, a fresh take on current events and a strong and positive commentary on self respect and how to focus on the real things in this crazy life.  Highly recommended; you will laugh from beginning to end!!!",1235433600,2,1526,4.654275092936803
3523188,5,B001D2WUAM,"I like all of Katt Williams comedy routines, but this is the funniest, especially talking about the lions.",1235347200,,106,4.944444444444445

3523191,3,B001D2WUAM,"Katt's first few standup specials were classics, but this one was just not as good. I can't even remember any genius one-liners from this dvd like I do from the last few.",1233532800,3,170,4.34375
3523192,5,B001D2WUAM,"This guy is aiming for the mantle. He's not trying to tell sex jokes like many of the comedians today. He's not trying to just go for laughs. He's trying to make us think while laughing. The profanity is all part of his norm. He ain't cussin' for cussin's sake. And he's very astute when it comes to social issues. Reminds me much of Richard. And if you don't get it, than it's just not for you. But, after everyone else discovers him, I'll bet we'll see the haters come out gushing on how he is the 'Flavor of The Month.' Just don't fall for the okey doke, Katt. Stay real. Like you said, 'If they're going to call you a crispy crackly crispy critter anyway, than you might as well get paid for it.' 5 stars because they don't have 6.",1232928000,,735,4.183098591549296

3523231,5,B001D2WUAM,"I watch the show but I wonder how strong would katt Williams comedy be if he took out the cursing. That's how I measure the strength of a black comedian. Over all Katt did make me laugh. Funniest line was ""B"" we don't know you like that, refering to Hillary Clinton on how assume that black people were going to vote for her.  Buy this it will make you laugh. Alright Miamifilms.net is out of here.",1231891200,,398,4.2368421052631575
