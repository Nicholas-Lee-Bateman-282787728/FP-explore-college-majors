8339760,3,B001SGEUCO,"Serious film by beginning documentary film-makers to tell the story of a horrible crime committed for the purpose of completing a horror movie, and although it is down-played... the crime was also committed to rid a disturbed man of what he considered to be a nagging wife. While the film-making of the documentary is about average, it is the story itself which made this dvd worth watching. Also, beware that many (all?) of the dvds of 'Rough Cut' have defects. Some defects will be pretty bad; some will be brief scrambling of the video. I was warned of this before my purchase, but already knowing about this crime I was interested in learning more, so I took the chance and bought it. My copy had moments of scrambled video. I get the impression these dvds were burned on one of the film-makers computers. It seems 'Rough Cut' is, indeed, itself a 'rough cut'. As for the material contained in this film, well... a few easy improvements would have made this documentary much better. in other words, the lack of experience in film-making shows. I will give credit to them for taking on this project and seeing it through, though. And again, the story is interesting even if the presentation is lacking. I do not regret buying this item.",1492646400,,1239,4.6880733944954125
8339761,5,B001SGEUCO,"Rough Cut is an extremely disturbing and absolutely bone chilling documentary about an amateur filmmaker who agrees to murder his friend's wife to pay for his low budget horror movie. Todd Klick uses interviews with family, friends, police and the cast of the horror film in question, along with news footage, stills and actual footage of the filming of ""Hike Through: A Ghost Story"" to paint a haunting portrayal of filmmaker Blaine Norris and friend Brian Trimble, who carried out a brutal act that could serve as a plot for any horror film. Klick's documentary is equal parts fascinating and horrifying as it paints a portrait of two Pennsylvania friends who, at first seem like your average film nerds/geeks but, the deeper we are pulled into their worlds and the more we learn about them, we start to find out that they both (especially Norris) are actually two very disturbed individuals. The documentary starts up with Randi Trimble's brutal murder in January 2003 and then traces back to her and Brian Trimble's wedding and Blaine Norris' subsequent quest to make a low budget horror film. We then move forward using the police investigation and the other interviews to gradually unveil how problems in the Trimble marriage and the financial burden of Norris' film brought these two emotionally deranged individuals to plot the vicious murder of Randi Trimble which Norris would agree to carry out in exchange for enough money to pay off his movie debts. This is a very haunting journey filmmaker Klick takes us on from the opening news footage of Mrs. Trimble's murder to the final frames that rest on her grave. It is a true story of two very unhinged men that will stay with you long after the documentary is over. A powerful and deeply affecting film.",1332201600,,1763,4.8604651162790695
8339762,2,B001SGEUCO,"i had read an article on msnbc about the tragedy that spurred this documentary, and then read further about the documentary. when i found it available here on amazon i was pleased to be able to see it at long last.

sadly, i have still not been able to see it, as the quality of this dvd is literally unwatchable. the first 20 minutes or so i could ALMOST make out what was happening and being said. after the 25 minute mark, the screen was so badly pixelated and the audio and visuals were so jumbled and mismatched i could understand only a few words here and there. at the 33 minute mark, the screen froze while the dvd timer kept going. when i tried to pause and restart it: nothing. when i tried rewinding or forwarding: nothing. except the last time i tried to forward it...it plopped me back into the main menu. that's when i finally gave up.

i rarely write bad reviews, but the studio that released this should be ashamed of themselves! they ruined what seemed to be a really decent documentary with horrible production quality.

i will definitely be writing to the studio for a refund. i will also look to see if i can find a way to watch it online as it still has my interest. if anyone knows of somewhere to see it (and actually SEE and HEAR it), please let me know!

please do not waste your money on this dvd!",1306368000,,1323,4.28
8339763,3,B001SGEUCO,"Rough Cut (Todd Klick, 2009)

The tagline of Rough Cut, Todd Klicks amateurish, if gripping, documentary, is ""would you kill to make a movie?"". And despite having spent over a month trying to come up with something better, I can't, because it sums this flick up so very well. It's a simple story, and one that gets told often enough, both in the movies in real life: a person is killed for his or her insurance money. The twist this time around: the insurance money was going towards the making of a slasher film.

Brian Trimble wasn't a filmmaker himself. But his friend Blaine Norris was, and Norris was obsessed with the making of Through Hike, which (to be honest) sounds a lot like your basic low-budget horror flick (q.v. My recent review of The Seamstress, which is almost identical in plot). Trimble was one of the producers of the film, and Norris was a hard-sell king. Enter Randi Trimble, Brian's new wife and the beneficiary of a hefty insurance policy. Brian and Randi may be newlyweds, but all is not well in paradise, at least not well enough for Blaine and Brian to cook up a plot to kill Randi for the insurance.

It's a solid piece of work, but not much more than that; you will feel, often, as if you're watching a slightly longer (82 min.) episode of 48 Hours Mystery or the like rather than a feature film. Still, if you're interested in amateur filmmaking, true crime, or any combination of the two, then this is definitely worth your time. ***",1282608000,,1466,4.524528301886792
8339764,4,B001SGEUCO,"Without giving too much away, this documenatary looks into the ""story behind the story"" of the making of a small independant film called ""Hiking Through.""  Before the movie is completed, someone is murdered.  It looks like the husband (the cinematographer of the film) did it, or did he?  Maybe it was the director.  Unfortunately for the story, there are no other real suspects, and after some pretty stupid ""you ain't never gonna catch us"" letter-writing to taunt the cops (or throw them off the trail), the murderer confesses pretty quickly after he is caught.  Add some dungeon and dragon nerd-blaming, and some creepy aspects in the film's script that may or may not have played a role in the actual murder, and you get a pretty good documentary.  The real story (as it usually happens) is just some stupid people thinking they can kill other people and get away with it - this one just involves a nerd killer who was involved in making a film at the same time - the question is, was the murder done to acquire money to complete the film?",1261872000,,1043,4.610810810810811
8339765,2,B001SGEUCO,"First of all, the documentary is pretty interesting. Husband lets his filmmaker friend murder his wife to collect the insurance money to fund his low budget horror movie that nobody will ever see.

I'm giving this 2 stars because of the absolutely horrible DVD quality. Several times throughout the movie, the picture became all pixelated. It looks like a YouTube video. Other times, the video and audio become completely out of sync with each other. And this doesn't take place with any of the low quality VHS home video footage. I'm talking about the interviews they filmed when making the documentary. One point, the movie just froze. I checked the DVD for scratches but it was brand new.

There's no excuse for this.",1252108800,2,720,4.845528455284553
8339766,4,B001SGEUCO,"I saw this film during it's limited run at the Allen Theater in Annville Pennsylvania. I was incredibly impressed. It's a well-crafted look at the incredible lengths two misguided individuals were willing to go through to produce a movie.

It is incredibly interesting.",1241481600,3,269,5.255813953488372
