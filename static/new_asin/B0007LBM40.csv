2216816,4,B0007LBM40,Excellent movie. Solid performances by the entire cast.  Allison Pill and Mariska Hargitay prove that they can shine in demanding roles. Unexpected plot twists tied to the interplay between the Amish and modernday cultures heighten the drama and character development. You'll miss out on a good movie if you fall victim to the bias that made-for-TV productions aren't worth seeing on DVD. This one is better than many bigger budget Hollywood movies. Buy it. It's worth adding to your collection.,1121385600,26,495,5.1875
2216817,5,B0007LBM40,This was a different kind of movie then life time usually shows. But it was a great choice. This movie goes to show that no matter what ethnic group you are from it is possible for anyone to commit a crime. And no matter how religious you are crime is possible. This is about one mothers mistake to keep her family together. I hope my review was helpful. And I hope you enjoy the movie.,1114992000,3,386,4.16
2216818,1,B0007LBM40,"I was absolutely shocked and outraged that Lifetime TV would even consider showing such an inaccurate and ethically-biased movie.  Lifetime TV is supposed to be impartial, REALITY-BASED television designed to entertain and educate women and their families.  This movie, while excellently filmed and directed, is a travesty of truth and a blatant case of prejudice, not just against the Amish people but against old-world lifestyles, teachings, and values in general.  I agree that there are definitely some serious mistakes in the old-fashioned ways of living (such as mandatory male dominance and the use of physical discipline), but that is no reason or excuse to say that ALL of the old world is flawed.  Nor should we disregard and condemn rigid moral values, or pretend that such rules would be likely to cause a girl to behave as she does in the movie.  Besides, from what I know, the Amish people do NOT really live or act the way they are portrayed in this movie --- they are not chilly narrow-minded individuals, as the actors in this movie characterize them.  And I speak from experience --- I happen to know some Amish and Mennonite people quite well, and while I wholeheartedly agree that they could certainly stand to ease up a little on a few of their strict rules and on their heavily religion-based lifestyle, they are definitely NOT like the bitter hypocritical people portrayed here.  They are actually very gentle kindly people who care deeply about each other and have strong family values.  They do not banish or disown someone just because, as in the case of this girl's brother, he chooses to depart from some of the ways he was originally taught, especially if the difference in philosophy involves a harmless and relatively minor issue like this (it's not as if the young man decided to live an irresponsible life of debauchery or crime --- all he wanted to do was get a college education).  In fact, as I understand it, the Amish actually have a long-standing policy of always giving each of their offspring a CHOICE of how he desires to live --- once a child reaches a certain age, he is asked whether he wants to continue living under the values and practices of his community, or if he wishes to leave the community and live in a manner of his own personal choosing.  And if he decides to leave, his decision is accepted peaceably and amicably by all.  The young person is permitted to go off and live his (or her) own life without stigma or resentment, either from his family or the community in general.  And he is still loved and cared about by his fellow Amish, and he is completely welcome to come back and visit anytime he pleases.

I also took strong exception to the movie's apparent implied assertion that the Amish people are careless or unaware about proper hygiene.  As a matter of fact, the Amish homes and farms I visited appeared remarkably clean and fresh-smelling, and the people were almost all trim and fit and calmly cheerful.  So it is obvious that the Amish lifestyle apparently actually promotes GOOD health, and from what I know, their incidents of infant mortality and irresponsible behavior are actually very low.  Virtually all the Amish children I have seen have been unusually healthy and well-behaved, and the adults live a very long time, too.

So in conclusion, I feel that this movie is a despicable portrayal of one of the most harmless and sensible sectors of our population.  As the lawyer in the movie herself stated, Amish people simply do not do things like this (not usually, anyway), so why make a movie claiming that they do?  I am a great fan of Lifetime TV, but in this case it should be ashamed of itself.",1113782400,16,3679,4.7203125

2217061,3,B0007LBM40,"Plain Truth
1 Disc Widescreen, released July 13, 2010

""Plain Truth"" was a Lifetime movie from 2004 directed by Paul Shapiro based on the novel by Jodi Picoult. Mariska Hargitay plays Ellie Harrison, a criminal lawyer who takes on the case of a dead baby in an Amish community and the 18-year-old mother, Katie played by Alison Pill who denies she was ever pregnant though medical tests would prove otherwise.

Picture the Harrison Ford movie ""Witness"" and switch the male detective to a female defense attorney and a different mystery. That's the feel here. There are lots of comments on the Amish culture's plainness, anti-violent stance, and firm embrace of tradition.

Ellie needed a vacation from her profession after feeling guilty about winning her last case when her client probably deserved jail time. As a favor to a friend she takes on this case and in requesting bail, the judge makes the unusual demand that Ellie have to stay in the Amish community till the trial ends to make sure the girl doesn't flee. Mariska Hargitay (from ""Law and Order: SVU) is very convincing in the courtroom and plays the Lifetime level of all-around wonderful leading woman to the fullest.

The story takes us down all sorts of paths with what could have happened since Katie keeps lying about the circumstances and giving different versions. The result is frustratingly simple, but at least they didn't go the really obvious route. Alison Pill (whom you might remember from the fantastic ""Dan in Real Life"" movie with Steve Carrell in 2007) was well-cast here since she looks so natural in the plain Amish setting and does well in an understated emotional performance. It was easy to believe her simple logic and thought process, yet she was able to remain a mystery for most of the movie.

Since it is a Lifetime movie, our main two leads are women who have to control their own fate with weighty decisions and they threw in a slight romance with a doctor interviewing Katie in a temporary insanity defense tactic. Completely unnecessary, but she called on a man in her time of need even though she's an independent woman who can stand on her own, la la la.

This was the best of the three Lifetime movies I reviewed this week because in spite of the cliche, the Amish people are a fascinating people and courtroom dramas appeal to me greatly.

Sorry had to get that off I just finished the movie.,1221782400,,476,4.241758241758242
2217066,4,B0007LBM40,"By far one of the best Lifetime movies I have seen. Excellent story, acting, directing, scenery, sets, and camera work. If you enjoy a good drama you should at least rent this one. An Amish girl, expertly played by Alison Pill, is accused of murdering her baby when they find a dead infant near her parents farm house. She shows signs of giving birth, but she claims she never had the baby. A friend of the family tries to assist them by asking her friend to defend the girl. Mariska Hargatay of ""Law and Order"" plays her attorney deftly. The judge makes her the girls custodian. Hargatay does an excellent job of showing a wide range of emotions as this case unfolds many surprises. If you enjoyed this catch ""Witness"" and ""The Client"".

2217067,5,B0007LBM40,This movie is great from start to finish. Mariska Hargitay is such a great actress and when your watching her you can feel all the emotions she's feeling. This lady deserves to be in more movies! I was shocked by the ending! If you like surprise endings this movie is for you. This movie is never dull or boring. Totally worth the money and time.,1212192000,5,346,4.338461538461538
2217068,4,B0007LBM40,I pretty muck picked this up based on Mariska Hargitay on Law & Order. This could have been better as a series than a movie. Mariska is wonderful as always. Its a shame she doesn't get top Hollywood roles.,1188518400,,205,4.282051282051282
2217069,5,B0007LBM40,"Excellent movie, although it was made for TV the story line is such that it will grab you and have you trying to find out the ending before the movie is half over. Highly recommend the movie.",1188345600,,191,4.1891891891891895
2217070,5,B0007LBM40,I purchased this movie because I am so impressed with the acting ability of Mariska Hargitay.  She does an excellent job in this film and truly lives the part.  The film is intriguing and emotional without raw sex or offensive language.  It is thought provoking and a definitely a movie for our time. The surprise ending of the film and the non-verbal emotions expressed by Mariska are captivating.,1168473600,9,398,4.823529411764706
2217071,3,B0007LBM40,I bought this movie since I had read the book the movie was based on. The movie is somewhat differant from the book. I knew what the outcome was and was disappointed since the story wasn't like what I had read. Mariska Hargitay is very good but the other actors were okay. Wait until this movie comes out on TV or buy a used copy of the DVD. Better yet read the book.,1144281600,,367,4.041095890410959

2217073,5,B0007LBM40,"The Plain Truth showcased Mariska Hargitay's great acting ability and provided an entertaining escape for me--I just love a good mystery.  I truly loved the story and the characters.  Seeing a person from today's society staying with the Amish was a fascinating anomoly, like Witness, the movie with Harrison Ford about ten or so years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1128988800,3,374,5.098360655737705

8048012,5,B0007LBM40,"I ALWAYS like to watch Mariska Hargitay in the Law & Order Special Victims Unit shows. I think she is a GREAT actress & I have been a fan of her acting for a lot of years. I just had to buy & watch this Plain Truth dvd movie. The dvd movie did not want to play right at first. My husband found a small piece of dirt & a scratch on it. However, I think this might have happened from our own home dvd player. The dvd itself was brand new when it arrived at our home.
  Mariska Hargitay again did an EXCELLENT job of acting in this movie. She is obviously able to be flexible & versatile in her acting roles. She was able to show herself as a tough defense lawyer for the Amish young adult woman who did not take any nonsense when the same young adult woman kept lying to her. Mariska Hargitay was also able to show herself as a human being with human emotions like everyone else in spite of her highly stressful job. This was shown well in the parts of acting between herself and her ex-boyfriend.
  I had my own personal suspicions about who else could have either refused to get medical attention for the baby which could have saved the baby's life, or, who else could have killed the defenseless & innocent baby. I still did not know for sure & had to keep guessing until the very end. And at the very end, it turned - out that my original suspicions were right the whole time.
  I did not ever have the chance to read the book first, & therefore I was NOT disappointed with the movie at all. Overall: I am very glad that I bought this movie. I really hope that Mariska Hargitay can do even more acting in movies like this again in the future!",1494115200,,1644,4.137931034482759

8048015,5,B0007LBM40,"I found this movie because of Hargitay and I'm glad I did. The script and story was intriguing and both Mariska Hargitay and Alison Pill were great. It was different seeing Hargitay in the role as Ellie, the criminal lawyer when I'm used to seeing her as detective Olivia Benson but she did not disappoint. I highly recommend this movie!",1491609600,,337,4.633333333333334
