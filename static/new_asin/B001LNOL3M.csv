So, I put fasting on the 'back burner' (if you will pardon the expression).

Than I was given a copy (sorry) of this DVD from a friend.  What an experience!  If I had heard about it before I would have bought it...so I'm here to tell you two things:

1) I learned or better still, understood more about fasting watching Lockman here then in all the other books I have read

2) If you want to make sense of fasting, WATCH this DVD!!!

This is not about anything except Fasting, pure and simple, and direct.

Well, well done!",1261440000,4,660,4.308943089430894
8318859,5,B001LNOL3M,"One of the best articulations on fasting, the why's and the how's that I have ever heard or read.

Lockman is THE fasting expert.  Normally, you would have to travel to Panama and then drive a long road up the mountains to meet him and ask him these important questions, but here is your chance.

I was so impressed, I have been lending this DVD to others who are not well, or not feeling 100%.  Fasting is such a economical, sane, and efficient way to get better, keep young and to remove the causes that make us so sick, that it will have a comeback!

Lockman makes it simple.  Well worth watching!!!",1255046400,4,602,4.330357142857143
8318860,5,B001LNOL3M,"Lockman really knows his stuff.  I met many people who have fasted with him, and know that he is one of the TOP authorities on real fasting.

He is not a 'trend' faster, he is the real thing.  This DVD is exceptional and worth anyone's time who is interested in fasting, wants to fast, has a family member or friend who wants to fast, or is ill, and is considering if fasting is for them.

It's very inexpensive to watch this DVD and learn from someone like Lockman.  10 out of 10!",1240963200,3,481,4.184782608695652
8318861,5,B001LNOL3M,"Fasting is making a comeback - because it works.  Science is only new beginning to understand why fasting works - but Lockman is ready to share what he knows.  A truly informative workshop or discussion on fasting, I think EVERYONE should watch this before fasting or if they are helping someone else fast.

Highly recommended!",1240531200,4,327,4.909090909090909
8318862,5,B001LNOL3M,"Transformational Fasting is a in depth look into a Fasting Guru and how he cures.  An amazing video.  If you desire to fast, watch this first, YES!  WATCH this first!..... learn how fasting allows us to experience fully the intricate relationship of the mind, body, and the spiritual world. Step by step, Lockman takes us through the fasting process, the physical, emotional, and spiritual healing resulting from this transformational phenomenon.",1240099200,4,446,5.3428571428571425
8318863,5,B001LNOL3M,This is one of the only REAL fasting guru's - and he is not easy to find - so save a flight to Panama and watch this man and listen to his wisdom and methods....you'll learn so much!,1239667200,4,182,3.8157894736842106
8318864,5,B001LNOL3M,"I was introduced to fasting 30 years ago, and have met many fasting 'gurus' since....many of them really don't even understand the true meaning of fasting, (fully explained in this DVD)....what is great about this DVD is it gets you up close and personal with a REAL fasting professional.  Thinking about fasting?  this DVD puts the very questions you are asking yourself every day, and gets clear and very intelligent answers, backed up with full explanations as to why fasting cures.

Its well worth the price of the DVD - can save you a long trip to Panama to meet and ask the same questions.",1237420800,4,595,4.647619047619048
8318865,5,B001LNOL3M,"I've been hearing about Fasting from a number of friends who are interested in alternative health - but I had no idea that there were so many views on the subject, so I was looking to see what would be a good way to REALLY understand Fasting, and found this DVD by recommendation.  Wow!  Lockman really is a Guru!  I got an basic and advanced course in Fasting in one package.  Not only was the information strong, but the setting - in the Fasting Tanglewood wellness center, really was wonderful - a chance to see behind the scenes.  Makes HD worthwhile.  I can't recommend this enough - if you are new to the idea of Fasting, you will want this DVD - if you are already well versed in Fasting - watch this DVD - because Lockman is a Guru's Guru.",1233100800,15,747,4.26241134751773
8318866,5,B001LNOL3M,"I never really thought about fasting, except for religious purposes, until I picked up this DVD by Robin Keiko Gregory. Her discussion with the Panamanian Fasting Guru Loren Lockman was fascinating as well as inspirational. The segment on anti- aging fasting was worth the cost of the DVD alone. Diets come and go, but fasting has always been associated with good health and vitality for thousands of years. Though a novice on the subject, I left the experience of viewing this DVD, 'Transformational Fasting' a little more knowledgeable but also with plenty of tools for my tool box for maintaining a healthy balance in my life.",1232841600,15,629,4.943396226415095
