8612420,5,B0022BPD02,"I just saw this at the Cleveland International Film Festival and absolutely loved everything about it. I do not speak Russian, so obviously the subtitles were a great help to me, but it's hardly the movie's fault that somebody bought the wrong version off of the internet. Anyway, I thought the acting was great, the story was very interesting (especially for someone who did not grow up or have much familial experience with Communist Russia), and it was an all-around wonderful movie to see. I look forward to purchasing the film when it comes out with the English subtitles. Hipsters/Boogie Bones/Stilyagi is definitely a must see!",1269820800,,634,4.990566037735849
