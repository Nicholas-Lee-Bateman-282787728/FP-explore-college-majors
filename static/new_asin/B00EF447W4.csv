5911055,5,B00EF447W4,"Great package!
The movies are in great shape and the cover works well with the movies.
The only thing I dislike is the inside of the case, the discs all sit back to back of each other and sometimes they
fall out and the plastic on the inside that the discs are laying on don't lay right when trying to shut the case entirely. Otherwise love the movies, and i don't think anyone would be disappointed :)",1373932800,,402,4.233766233766234

5911062,5,B00EF447W4,Every single American Pie film never fails to make me laugh out loud every single time I watch them. Now that I own all of them on Blu-Ray it's even better. One thing I was disappointed in was that only American Reunion has a main menu. All of the special features and extras are held on that one disk. If your an American Pie fan then I would definitely get this box set and remember to Play On Playa!,1361318400,,402,4.10126582278481

The only thing is when I bought the film, the packaging did not indicate that  the digital copies were available for UK only.  I was soo mad, but the films are enjoyable.  I will certainly be looking for a cloud version of these films.  To all you readers, beware of the fine print when purchasing digital copies.

5911081,5,B00EF447W4,"Great set love the movies on Blue ray.  Anyhow has anyone noticed that the movie are different/ better than on dvd.  It seems like all the movies I previously had on dvd and switched to blue ray have gotten 10 times better.  Like there all restored to the original cut of the film or somethng.  I am now 31 and started to actually think this movie wasn't funny anymore to kifish needed different/more lines in the sceens to make it funny for older adults and just funnier in general.  Somehow on blue ray they did exactly that everything I wished they changed was amd the movies are great again.  Dont understand, if anyone has info on this subject or agree with me please respond.  Love the blue ray set American pie done the way its supposed to be done.",1445299200,,755,4.388489208633094
5911082,4,B00EF447W4,"I was slightly hesitant on picking this version because it was the UK release, but the description said it was playable on all Blu-ray players so I went with it.
Now, let me go ahead and say this: I was angry for the first 10 minutes of trying to play AP but only seeing AP 2. Then I realized how stupid I was.

When I opened the first Blu-ray case (containing AP and AP2), I took out the disc and tossed it into the Blu-ray player, hoping to play American Pie. After getting through all the ""Dont' Steal"" screens, it started American Pie 2. I thought, ""No, I want to watch American Pie."" Went back to the menu screen and didn't see an option for American Pie. I look at the back of the case and see that it was supposed to work for my player. I then though, ""Hopefully I didn't get a dud disc, or that for whatever reason American Pie just won't play on this player because of the version it is.""
Needless to say, I went back and forth through the menus, etc. and couldn't find American Pie. Then, I looked back inside the case. And there it was. On the left side (inside of front cover, you know, where video game manuals get placed), BEHIND some random insert was the disc for American Pie.
No, the case didn't feel any different after I took out the American Pie 2 disc, and no the disc for American Pie didn't move around / make any noise. And who ever looks behind those advertisement inserts they put inside Blu-ray cases anyways?

Anyways, the movies are still as ridiculous as I remember them being and there are a lot of extras as well.",1444176000,2,1546,4.255102040816326
