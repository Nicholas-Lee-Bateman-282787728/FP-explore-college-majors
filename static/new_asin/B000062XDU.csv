7958094,3,B000062XDU,"I'll preface this by saying that I've liked at least quite well every Hot Body video that I've ever seen, including this one. The company seems to have an endless supply of beautiful and sexy women. The 10 ladies here (who are probably all in their 20s) pretend to play various sports - tennis, croquet, golf, and so on - but these games are just a prop for what they mostly do, which is stripping and posing for the camera. I really wanted to see mostly nude sports going on, but if you like the format they use here, it's done well. Some of it is really hot - my favorite is the woman doing scuba diving in the buff, then sexy posing in some kind of underwater vessel. One of the ladies does comic bits between each segment by being a total klutz at every sport. If you like hugely busty women, there's just one I'd put in that category, though most are over average in that regard.

Picture quality is good, and the talk on it switches back and forth from the women to a narrator. However, the run time is a little stingy at about 55 minutes. The end credits shows one of the ladies actually playing tennis, so why did they not give us an extra 30 minutes of that? The box says the DVD runs 105 minutes, but they must have been adding in the extensive trailers for other Hot Body videos. The only other substantial bonus is a good photo gallery of the ladies on this DVD. Anyway, if you like hot babes stripping and posing, this is quite good, but because of the rather short time for the price, and the fact that the title implies more sports going on, I knocked it down to a 3.",1155513600,9,1582,4.203947368421052
