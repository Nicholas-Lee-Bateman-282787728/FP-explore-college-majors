8438602,2,B004QXKH8M,"Disappointing.  I expected better quality video and more educational value than performance.  This should not be called Ultimate drum lessons, since there's very little in terms of ""lessons"".  Great performances, but the educational value is more conceptual than instructional.",1481587200,,277,6.051282051282051

8438604,5,B004QXKH8M,"A great piece of work, that gives drummers a different way to approach music.  I enjoy watching, and learning from this video.",1400198400,,126,4.7272727272727275
8438605,3,B004QXKH8M,"I thought it would be more in depth teaching. Title should be, "" great drummers/ different styles"" or something. I enjoyed listening to them play, though. Not Disappointed, just thought it would be more teaching.

Thank you,

8438606,1,B004QXKH8M,I disliked this because there is no lessons in it. This book would be great for the teacher. I gave to my drum teacher.,1358208000,,119,4.0
