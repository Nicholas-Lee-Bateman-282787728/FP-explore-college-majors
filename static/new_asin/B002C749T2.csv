3904449,3,B002C749T2,"This is an effective, minimalist, abridged staging of Shakespeare's tragedy, with a thirty-something Orson Welles in the lead. Peter Brook's direction is fine and the cast is solid. Unlike the old VHS release, this DVD contains the entire broadcast, including Alistair Cooke's introductory remarks (but minus the commercials). The extras were a pleasant surprise.

The quality of the video transfer is slightly disappointing. I suspect this is an old transfer, perhaps even the one used twenty years ago in the VHS release.

The image is soft and flickery, and the movement of the characters on screen is more juddery and riddled with momentary double-exposures than you usually see in modern transfers from 1950s kinescopes. Compare the main feature on this disc against the much cleaner and more watchable images in the extras (also taken from ""Omnibus"" kinescopes) and you'll see what I mean. And I can't believe they didn't touch out those great big cue spots at the end of the reel. That would have been so easy to fix!

Despite this, I enjoy the program. I just wish a more watchable print were available on disc.",1281916800,22,1119,4.973262032085562
3904450,2,B002C749T2,"This Lear is of historical interest - old TV trying to be cultured, but it is a very poor enactment of the play.  It seems to belong to the Shakespeare presentations of a century ago.",1275523200,4,183,4.228571428571429
3904451,5,B002C749T2,"E1 Entertainment (formerly Koch Home Video) partnered last year with the Archive of American Television to release some extremely rare television shows from their archives on home video. Nearly all of these shows have not been seen by the public since they were broadcast over 50 years ago! Thanks to both early videotape and Kinescopes (live TV broadcasts preserved on film) we are able to re-live what were originally one-time performances. This DVD is one such event.

Actor/Write/Director (and more!) Orson Welles love Shakespeare and mounted many of Shakespeare's classics. In the early days of TV, in the 1950s, Shakespeare was not something the average viewer was expecting to see. And certainly not with the great Welles, who was living in England at that time.

TV was still in its infancy then and experimenting with its programming. This was a time when there were fewer distractions and other entertainment options for the American public. So CBS (under William Paley) created a 90-minute ""arts magazine"" to be broadcast on Sunday afternoons - remember there were no regular sports broadcasts then - hosted by Britisher Alistair Cooke. It was called ""Omnibus"". For its third season they came up with a real gem. Welles would make his American TV debut in a 90-minute production of ""King Lear"", directed by the then 29 year old British Director Peter Brook. Brook's wife, Natasha Parry, would play Cordelia. The sponsors would become ""subscribers"" so there would be no commercial breaks. And, the script would be revised - leaving out all the subplots - so the actual production ran only 78 minutes! On October 11, 1953 the show aired. And it has not been since - until this release.

E1 has gone the extra step in putting together this package. Preceding the October 11th show we are giving the ""preview"" which aired the week before. To add to the understanding of Shakespeare we are presented with a 10-minute portion of a later Omnibus show where Dr. Frank Baxter (who helped Walt Disney explain science to kids, like me, in the 1950s in ""Our Friend the Atom"") gives the history of the Globe Theater. Another 42-minute bonus is a live remote from 1954 at the Yale Shakespeare Festival and a 43-minute episode from 1955 with drama critic Walter Kerr discussing the staging of Shakespeare's plays.

All the prints are in more than acceptable viewing condition and the sound is very good. And all were captured ""live"".

This is a must for any Shakespeare fan and should be in every school library's DVD collection. There are more ""Omnibus"" shows coming from the AAT and E1. I can hardly wait for the next one!

3904452,3,B002C749T2,"This television version has many flaws--from actors stepping on each other's lines, to bad microphone placement, to an obviously robust Welles' proclaiming his weakness and frailty in the face of chaotic nature and bad fortune.  Still, there are scenes that convey the play's meanings more straightforwardly and clearly than any you will fine in later filmizations.  The crucial opening scene, for example, effectively and efficiently sets up the play in a manner that students immediately grasp.  The film is still a useful teaching tool (and obviously of interest to Welles' devotees), providing one is selective in its use.",974419200,9,626,5.36734693877551

8363358,5,B002C749T2,Invaluable document of great performance by dedicated Shakespearean actor/director Orson Welles. Kinescope image smeary but typical of early television recording process. Dialog amazingly clear - fairly good frequency response in the vocal range - despite incessant high frequency sibilant distortion.

8363359,5,B002C749T2,"Just a very quick point.
  This is a highly cut version of Lear.
  But to see Orson Welles in the part is even beyond a Revelation.
  No words for it!!!!  Great In ways that none of our recent Lears
  (i.e. Michael Pennington's) in all their greatness can manage.
  So, see what you think.  And write something better here.",1410393600,2,323,4.379310344827586
8363360,4,B002C749T2,"I give this Four Stars for the great Orson Welles-for any thing that Welles does is great. There are also some other note worthy performances- for instance a wonderfully original Fool. There are also some interesting bonus features, such as an example of what Shakespearean dialogue sounded like in Shakespearean times, which sounds closer to what we think of as an Irish dialect (as opposed to the classic English of Richard Burton or Peter O'Toole) and an analysis of alternative interpretations of Hamlet's motivations, with a talented Hamlet re-enacting the various versions. HOWEVER, the Lear is nearly ruined by some ridiculous story editing that if you are on alert becomes hilariously though unintentionally funny.",1404777600,,722,5.342105263157895
8363361,5,B002C749T2,"This is a murky TV kinescope from the 1950s, so don't expect vivid picture quality, but this is a state-of-the-art video recording for its time. Although the play was mercilessly cut down to accommodate the fleeting time a commercial network would allow for a dramatic broadcast, this video record is a treat to learn what could be done with real-time, live-to-air television production, giving it an edge of immediacy and inventiveness that has just about disappeared from television today. Welles' reading of Lear is committed and brilliant with some wonderful dynamics. His is a very honest Lear. Welles had the uncanny ability to focus an appropriate performance tweaked correctly for whatever medium he was working in. He just ""got it,"" as did most of the cast in this project. Especially interesting is the clever set design which packed a lot of location information into a few elements, apparently to accommodate the breakneck speed with which the many changeovers needed to be silently executed. The elaborate physical setting of Lear's unraveling at the mill, where his reason is ground to dust, was wonderfully ambitious. There are some huge gears symbolically turning away in that windmill. The camera blocking and operation were very well executed throughout. I would love to see live drama for video as a feature on today's Internet, perhaps the most likely medium for this rapidly fading art form. There is terrific programming potential there. This Lear would be a great piece to study as a standard for what can be done live for camera.",1402272000,6,1553,5.0703125
8363362,4,B002C749T2,"As Alistair Cook explains in the introduction, this less than 90 minute production eliminates the major subplot involving the Earl of Gloucester and his two sons, Edmund and Edgar. Cook says the subplots were added to pad out a play to stretch to almost four hours, and give the principle actors a rest. What we notice, however, is that by removing that time, Lear's descent into madness goes far more quickly than we see in the full length play.

When the play opens, it seems wooden, and Welles seems to lack animation, on a throne and the camera drawn back. Business seems simplified, as all three daughters are present on stage with the opening, all in a neat row. It is only after the first act that we see a far more animated Lear, even more so than those of Lawrence Olivier and Ian McKellen. This is where the biggest difference between the production custom made for TV differs from the productions translated from live stage to the studio. Between Welles and Peter Brook, who is credited with the adaptation, much better use is made of close-ups of Welles face, and he uses that to great advantage. This production also uses more realistic scenery and costuming of the Elizabethan times.

I always pay special attention to the role of the fool in ""Lear"". It seems to be the second best part, especially when well played. And it always seems well played. The fool in this production is Alan Badel, who does not have a long list of movie or TV credits; however he often played leads in Shakespeare on the stage. His fool here is as good or better than the other two I have recently seen, augmented by camera work which was well adapted to TV.

Near the end, during Lear's madness on the heath and on to Dover, the production seems to be especially careful with Welles aging abilities, as he loses practically none of his clothing, where in other productions, especially with McKellen, Lear ends up virtually naked. That is made up somewhat by the camera's paying close attention to Welles face and his expressions, which he uses to good purpose.

The TV direction is good, but missteps now and then, as the backs of actors heads block others' faces. It appears the original was recorded on kinescope, which is virtually always grainy. Of course, it is also in black and white.

Overall, of the three recorded productions I have seen, I still prefer the McKellen for the best Lear (with Sylvester McCoy as the fool) but the Olivier version (with John Hurt as the fool) for most other aspects.",1369785600,15,2499,4.632054176072235
8363363,5,B002C749T2,"It is rumored that Wells was involved in the Elizabeth Short murder.

What exactly his involvement was is a guess that leaves one to wonder about the scandalous reputation of Hollywood.

Borderline on a true work of brilliance and a notoriously lecherous and failed attempt to bring to life this Shakespearian epic.

I guess it all depends on what the truth is regarding Wells' involvement in the Elizabeth Short murder.",1360540800,,420,4.9714285714285715
