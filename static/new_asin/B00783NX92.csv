Couple times, I reminded myself ""this guy is REALLY Old"" (like me.)  :)

Really enjoyed it... Just wish Prime had included last couple songs (that were apparently on the disc)",1479945600,,198,4.764705882352941

8512262,1,B00783NX92,"I bought the blu-ray version on May 26, 2015 as a gift for my wife, who is a big Meat Loaf fan.  Unfortunately, she did not try playing it until this year, and it is past the return ""window.""  When we tried to play it in our SONY blu-ray player, it would not play.  My player has no trouble playing any other blu-ray or DVD discs.  If the seller reads this, I would love to swap it for one that works.  If YOU do buy this disc, try it out immediately to be sure it functions as it should.  Sorry for the bad review; thank you.",1472947200,,526,3.9150943396226414
8512263,3,B00783NX92,"I am a fan of Meatloaf who's real name is Michael lee Aday stage name is Meatloaf of course
the First album Bat out of Hell is still the best album, Jim steinman wrote all the songs & Meatloaf sang them
Despite all the other albums that came after that, Bat out of Hell is the best one

i was thinking of buying Meatloaf's latest Live recorded concert, GUILTY PLEASURE TOUR LIVE SYDNEY 2012
Meatloaf is in his mid 60's now so i'm not just going to buy it unless it's worth buying
so i was able to check out some songs off the internet
i was not impressed of what i saw
i'm sorry but Meatloaf's performance now these days is very embarrasing
and this latest blu-ray concert was filmed/recorded only few years ago and i was not impressed
i only checked the tracks from the original Bat out of Hell album actually
and i tell you what Meatloaf cannot sing those High notes anymore
you see camera close up shots of him really struggling to sing the Bat out of Hell song
he's standing in the same spot not really moving around much
plus in some parts of the song he was slightly out of time, only slighty
there's some other tracks i checked out aswell
he performs Timewarp with Hot pattotie at the beginning of the concert
i was not impressed i thought how embarrasing, i could see Meatloaf was Definitely struggling with those High notes
also struggling to keep solidly in time, very very slightly out of time
i feel very sorry for the fans who bought tickets, tickets would've costed over $150-$200 easily

his back up band he had for this 2012 tour i'm sure are fine musicians there all session players obviously
he's added extra musicians- a violinist, an extra keyboard player aswell as the Piano player anyway
it was ridiculous
in my opinion the original Line up from the bat out of Hell album is the best
Max weinberg who played the Drums on Bat out of Hell album, incredible player
Max was and still is Bruce springsteen's main Drummer
and Ellen Foley who was the female singer on the album
unfortunately this lineup never actually went on tour with Meatloaf
they only played on the album

Meatloaf cannot sing the High notes anymore especially in his most famous popular track Bat out Hell
you can see him struggling to keep in time with the song
he's in his mid 60's now time for him to Retire.
it is tragic but all old singers go through the same thing
AC/DC's Brian Johnson is having similar difficulties aswell Brian can't get the High notes anymore either
2-3 stars i gave this new blu-ray concert
it is Difficult to watch you can see Meatloaf struggling with his singing.
but that's my opinion of course. so i didn't waste my money buying it",1427414400,,2650,4.437371663244353
8512264,5,B00783NX92,I just bought this DVD an hour ago at Wal Mart for 11.78.  Watching it right now for the forst time and it is great just like the US tour two years ago.  Perfect for your Loaf collection,1372982400,2,186,3.8684210526315788
8512265,5,B00783NX92,"64-year-old Meat Loaf hits the stage in Sydney (shortly after a disastrous live performance at the AFL final) accompanied by an army of HD cameras filming what he announced to fans would be one of his final trips to perform in Australia/New Zealand.  He makes restitution in full for the AFL nightmare.

  Hot Patootie - Bless My Soul/Time Warp
  If It Ain't Broke, Break It
  Bat Out of Hell
  Peace on Earth
  Living on the Outside

  Two Out of Three Ain't Bad
  Paradise by the Dashboard Light

  Mercury Blues
  +a 30-minute documentary offering a backstage look at Meat in preparation for taking the stage

The Good:

The video is outstanding; I'd even go so far as to say flawless.  It's simultaneously grand and intimate, basked in vivid colours, and tack-sharp HD.  The audio mix on the Blu-ray is equally without fault offering dynamics, impact, clarity, and openness.  The addition of a violinist and a sax-player to the band adds a great twist to some of the sound.  In particular, the sax-player (Dave Luther) is musically astounding; I've always felt that live rock is aided by the presence of a sax and this is absolute proof.  Meat's band has for for 30 years been the single best in the entire business and they are note-perfect here for every second of the performance.  Some pieces have been changed out from the long-term lineup, most notably Justin Avery is in and Mark Alexander is out.  While I loved Alexander, Avery's take on the songs is fresh and captivating - he takes the old and familiar and makes them new and intriguing; he's a jaw-dropping talent.  Meat's voice isn't what it once was owing to decades of destructive abuse; however, it gets stronger as the show goes along.  Meat himself is a showman without equal in the music industry and he turns in an honest, genuine, heart-felt evening of fun.  It was also wonderfully refreshing to have some new songs inserted into a setlist that had remained largely unchanged for several tours.  The documentary is a great add-on.

The Bad:

Nothing big really.  As mentioned, if you're watching a concert only to hear flawless, prerecorded, Mariah-runs then you're unlikely to be wowed.  If, however, you came for a big show by one of the best showman ever, then this shouldn't be a concern.  I thought a couple of the tracks were unusual choices and I always wish that Meat would draw in some of his great Bad Attitude tracks as that album has been largely forgotten despite representing one of the best recording outings of his career.

The Verdict:

Essential for any Meat Loaf fan.  The best video/audio offering of any Meat concert.  The vocals have been better on past concerts, but they in no way leave you feeling let down.  The best band that Meat's ever toured with.  5 stars out of 5 without reservations of any sort.",1360368000,10,3043,4.689523809523809
