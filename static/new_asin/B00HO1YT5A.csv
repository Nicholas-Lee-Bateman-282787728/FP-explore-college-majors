8634005,4,B00HO1YT5A,"I thought this was going to be another rom-com melodrama (metaphorically: more cheap food fare) typical of Mexico, Philippine, Thai, Indonesia, New York, some Hollywood and certainly Bollywood film studios. Pleasantly surprised by the writing, acting and unique storyline of what it's like (at least in some cases)  to be those extra faces in a film. The background of putting up with director whims and idiosyncrasies, intolerable assistants, uncertain logistics, competing for choice roles and, of course, the weather. Surprisingly realistic elements of disappointment as those rare opportunities of having  a speaking role can be so quickly lost.",1400889600,,649,5.612244897959184
