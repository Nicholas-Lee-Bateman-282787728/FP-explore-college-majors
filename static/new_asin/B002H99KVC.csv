3926870,3,B002H99KVC,"This 3-disc DVD release provides three Carrie films (except the 2013 release) in one collection. Carrie (1976), The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999) and the Carrie remake (2002 TV Movie). Carrie and its sequel are wide-screen while the remake is full-screen. Carrie is a classic horror film directed by Brian De Palma about a girl struggling with her teenage years, overbearing mother and her telekinetic powers. Amy Irving returns as Sue Snell in The Rage and we are drawn into the sequel through a series of flashbacks to the first film. Most fans consider the remake better than the sequel but not on par with the original. The remake is surprisingly light on blood and gore. The first film rates 4 stars and is legendary in horror; however the other two films rate 3 stars. Overall, the picture and audio quality is average but serviceable.

This is a great value pack for Carrie fans as you are better off getting this collection than purchasing the films separately. Only the original is available on Blu-ray but don't bother because it has below average picture quality, horrible audio quality and no extras (bare-bones release). The Carrie Triple Feature has managed to hold its value.",1377993600,4,1182,4.880597014925373

3926874,5,B002H99KVC,"I had never seen all of the original Carrie and had never seen ""Rage: Carrie 2"" and was unaware that a re-make of the original classic was ever made, so needless to say, I am glad I made this purchase. You can't beat the original, but I was very impressed with the sequel, ""Rage"". The re-make was good also, but not as good as the original with Sissy Spacek.",1364947200,4,358,4.202898550724638

3926877,5,B002H99KVC,"Personally I was searching for Carrie 2: the Rage ( I know I am a B movie freak)and was unable to find the one movie for less than the 3 together. I personally like the original Carrie better than the remake but actress who plays the mother is so great in the remake of the original that I may have to watch it another time to make an ultimate choice.
All the movies come on one disc and you can pick any of the three movies from the main menu. Some scene selections are a bit tricky but overall not too bad. Good quality packaging and everything played well.",1327449600,10,559,4.137614678899083

3926884,3,B002H99KVC,"Carrie and The Rage: Carrie 2 were both excellent, including the special features. However, Carrie (2002 Remake) was awful by comparison. Product description indicated ""not rated"", but far from what I expected. Seemed more like a ""Made For TV"" version.",1454284800,,252,5.325
3926885,5,B002H99KVC,Loved it,1451174400,,8,3.5
3926886,5,B002H99KVC,"I bought this specifically for the original ""Carrie"" video. It was the same price as the single option. I am not big on the remakes, but I figured if it cost the same, others who were borrowing it or viewing at my home may want to see other versions, too, so it wouldn't hurt to get the Deluxe Triple Feature. Quality was as described and I'd recommend this provider.",1449014400,,367,4.333333333333333

3926905,4,B002H99KVC,"If you're a fan of the story, this collection is a must. I watched all three. The 1976 movie was, of course, worth the full price. It's a unique film, the first adaptation of a Stephen King novel, (in fact, Carrie was Stephen King's first novel) and arguably the best except for The Shawshank Redemption. Director Brian De Palma's approach to the story is different. The key scenes are all edited very tightly around Pino Dinaggio's beautiful musical score. It's almost like a romance tale the suddenly turns into a horror story and sad tragedy.

The other two films are just gravy at this price. I recommend the 2002 TV adaptation of Carrie. Angela Bettis gives a totally different interpretation of the title character and gives a very good performance. The secondary characters are much more complete in this version than in De Palma's (a flaw in that film). Meanwhile, Katharine Isabelle steals the show as a secondary character, Tina Blake. She almost overshadows Chris as the villain. The film runs a little too long, however, and it's marred by poor special effects and underfunded CGI.

The other movie, The Rage: Carrie 2, is good only as curio. It's not up to original 1976 film (or near the 2013 remake). It's dull. Lackluster in acting, directing and writing. When they had flashbacks to the 1976 film, I couldn't help but compare. I'm glad I got the disk as part of a collection.

It arrived quickly and all three DVD's played well. The extras on the 2002 and The Rage: Carrie 2 were lacking, but that's more than made up for by the extras on the 1976 film, which was the best one anyway.

Only complaint: the case was damaged on the inside. The swing frame that holds two of the DVD's was cracked and doesn't stay in place, but it's workable.",1388534400,3,1756,4.636655948553055
3926906,4,B002H99KVC,"Having all three of these Carrie features in one package for this price was worth it, as I love the various incarnations of the Stephen King character. Except for the second film (The Rage: Carrie 2), which I can only watch on one side, as the widescreen freezes up at times, this package should keep me satisfied until the 2013 Carrie film is released in stores. And the television movie, having a twist ending with endless possibilities, was a godsend, as I'd never seen it before.",1386633600,,483,4.627906976744186
3926907,5,B002H99KVC,"These were exactly as advertized, A complete set of Carrie's, including a widescreen and full screen version of Carrie2.  A ""must-have"" for Carrie fans.",1383350400,,152,5.333333333333333

8370227,3,B002H99KVC,"The first Carrie was a great horror classic that needs no introduction nor help at all. The sequel IT SUCKS IT'S TERRIBLE.
