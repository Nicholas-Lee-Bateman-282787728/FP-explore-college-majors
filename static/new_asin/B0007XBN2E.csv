8053280,5,B0007XBN2E,"Such a cute, well-made cartoon. Kipper and his buddy, Tiger the Miniature Schnauzer, plus Pig and Arnold and Jake -- are all gentle, fun-loving characters. Very classy, very funny. You will enjoy it along with your toddler or pre-schooler! Five stars!",1231286400,,251,5.146341463414634
