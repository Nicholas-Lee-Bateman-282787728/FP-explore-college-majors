8192095,4,B000PKG964,"Karin is the oldest daughter in a family of Vampires. She has a strange deformity. Instead of sucking blood when she gets near her a person with her preferred blood type, Karin produces blood. Mostly it gushes from her nose. When she produces extra blood, she can give it to humans. It can give them a very positive experience. She meets a boy in school, Usui, who she develops a crush for. She wants to get close to him and have a relationship, but when she gets too excited around him she bleeds through her nose profusely.

This anime has a very fun and playful vibe. The characters and situations are funny and very entertaining. It's almost your typical high school romance/comedy. The Un-Vampire twist makes it quite different. My only complaint with this anime is the production quality. The animation isn't very detailed, and a little bit blurry. Especially in the character outlines. I do like the character designs and coloration though. My other issue is the bad voice acting. Most of the characters sound stoned or drunk. It takes a lot away from the series. I've listened to the English and Japanese tracks. They are both kinda bad. If you can deal with the sub par animation and bad voice acting, this series has a fun story. I have seen the prices on amazon and it's not worth it. I got it on e-bay for a whole lot cheaper. If you decide to try it out, I suggest watching it online or renting it before you buy.",1356048000,,1426,4.505791505791506

All Karin Maka wants is to be an oridnary teenage high-school girl.  Have friends, enjoy good things, maybe find a boyfriend....but that is very hard when you are part of a family of vampires and the only one who can go out in the daylight.  This disk starts with Kenta, Karin, and Anju being confronted by big brother Ren.  Before he can erase all of Kenta's memories, Anju stops him because of an idea.  At the family meeting she suggests that they make Kenta a friend and help Karin when they can not.  So her father goes and brings him to their house (kidnaps more like) and makes an offer....help out Karin, or have his mind so wiped that he would not know how to walk....gee, like he has a choice...Then things go a little off when Kenta's mother is still looking for a job and not finding anything, so poor Kenta is working himself to death to support both of them...and Karin's father has one problem with Kenta helping Karin.  not about the secret, but the typical worry of a father and a teenage daughter.  Then the stress picks up when a new transfer student comes to their class, Winter.  He is good looking, smart, a little overdramatic, and belienes he has found his soulmate in Karin....and did we mention that he is a VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!!!

The series is really picking up with mmore laughs and even more nosebleeds....can not wait for the next disc....",1185235200,7,1423,4.501945525291829
