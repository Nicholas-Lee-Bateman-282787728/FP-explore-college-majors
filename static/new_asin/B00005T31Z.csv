7953494,4,B00005T31Z,"I give it 4 stars because my kids still like it, even though they use tablets & not personal computers. 1st copy of this show we had was misplaced for awhile & my daughter was looking for it online for Christmas. I was surprised. This show is not Elmo centered. Surprising since Elmo is Sesame Street's cash cow. Though they stuck Elmo on because of an Elmo's World at the end. Telly is trying to figure out who is sending him e-mails having him guess the senders i.d. . No, he's not being stalked. Baby Bear gets involved & they go from individual to individual with skits happening in between. Not high on educational value. Adults will be ignoring it. Depends on the kid if they will be entertained. Technology a little outdated. Not as outdated as ''Jurassic Park'' computers. Why did Sesame Street get rid of handicapped people? The only two who worked on the show are gone. Maybe they left on their own. Well, they are in this video. I remember Linda from my childhood. Man, I'm getting old. Warning, video may age you:)",1424476800,,1026,4.521505376344086

7953496,3,B00005T31Z,"I often think the newer Sesame Street videos don't stack up to the old, but this one is an exception: a great introduction to computers that's entertaining, covers a wide variety of topics, and has an Elmo's world at the end for the diehard toddler fans!
The premise (which should spawn some discussion about internet and email safety with parents whose kids are old enough) is that Telly, who has sent his friends a request for replies after setting up a new email address, gets a mysterious email message from a friend who asks him to guess who they are.  Telly and other Sesame Street friends search high and low to find out who the mystery emailer is!  There are a lot of Sesame Street animated clips and songs to help the plot along, including a GREAT bit with Cookie Monster and Prairie Dawn.  If you're raising a budding hacker, this is for you!",1045267200,2,852,4.51948051948052
