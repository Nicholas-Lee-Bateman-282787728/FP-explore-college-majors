4504032,5,B004YZ3M66,"I have worked in an Arena for 25 years and was very impressed with this film. In getting to know many of the big names over the years like Randy Savage,Curt Hennig and Kerry Von Erich the drug issue was no surprise to me but might be to someone that just sits in the audience and has been a wrestling fan. I was very sad though especially over Mike Verdi who people watching the independent wrestling knew as Trent Accid. What many people did not know is that Mike was on the verge of getting a WWE contract .Mike had everything going for him but the demons got him like so many others. The last time I had hung out with Mike was at Racks Bar and Grill in Dover Deleware where they had the death matches,he looked like a million dollars,tan and in great health and I,m glad now I got a lot of pictures with him and his partner as he never looked like that again. Another guy on this dvd who is certainly a survivor is Kevin Sullivan,what a storied career and one of the great performers. This dvd has a great way of teaching one whos watching it thats its not so much a great dvd but a PSA for everyone that says ""DONT DO DRUGS"".",1336262400,7,1129,4.136363636363637
4504033,5,B004YZ3M66,"While I don't own this, I watched it last night on netflix.

Overall, It's a great film..and is very accurate as far as what goes on ""In the Business""

A good friend of mine is a co-owner of a local independent fed, I've tagged along to several shows over the years, helped load up that heavy ol' ring, and seen my share of Bingo Halls, to say the least. It's true that the chance of ending up on TV is slim, But most do it for the sake of entertaining others, hearing a kid cheer (or jeer) at his/her ""Hero"" up in the ring, the energy in the building, The ""Family"" they find in their fellow wrestlers...it's an amazing sight if you sit back and look at the whole picture.

It's quite interesting as well: When any average joe watches a match, they're watching to be entertained, When someone with Wrestling Experience watches a match, they too watch the Story/Entertainment Part, but they're also keenly watching Moves, Execution and the like.

Regardless, a great film, definitely worth a watch!",1318377600,4,997,4.553072625698324
4504034,4,B004YZ3M66,"Short Review: Overall:  Card Subject to Change is a fantastic insight into professional wrestling in a positive way and didn't focus too much on the negatives like the majority of wrestling documentaries do.  I really enjoyed watching this movie as it was very interesting and entertaining, if you want to learn about the wrestling industry and see what it is like outside of the big companies then Card Subject to Change is a easy recommendation for a rental but only a purchase for the real die hard indy fan.",1316304000,2,511,4.730337078651686
4504035,3,B004YZ3M66,"Judge Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict-- Card Subject to Change attempts to deliver a slice of that life, and is occasionally successful. The problem with the film isn't the stories in themselves, some of which are funny and some tragic. The problem is in the overall narrative, insofar as it doesn't exist. There are a few running threads, but they don't cross and, in one case, only evolve by circumstance. For fans of indie wrestling, there is a lot of interest, but as a cohesive documentary, it doesn't really work.

The three main stories involve Johnny Falco, a small time promoter out of New York, legendary wrestler Kevin Sullivan, and young indie darling Trent Acid. Falco runs a promotion that gets a lot of talent coming out of the big companies and, though he runs VFW halls and Elk's lodges, his shows look dramatically better than many of the independent promotions you will find, including the one I frequented, and loved so much, in Sacramento (which, incidentally, produced former WWE champion John Morrison). He seems to know what he's doing, though I wouldn't trust him has far as I could body slam him, and he runs a lot of shows, so one can safely call him a success in the industry. Kevin Sullivan, while a crazy person, is the true success of the film. He's a legend and listening to a guy like him is essential to navigating through the pro wrestling world. Trent Acid, sadly, is the cautionary tale of the group. Having starting wrestling at age 14, he worked his way up to become one of the young lions of the modern age. Influence got the better of him, though, and drugs became the way he coped and the way he died, just over 13 months ago. That's the best lesson of all.

Ultimately, what caused me to basically stop watching wrestling was the knowledge that these people, awesome as they may seem, are people with demons, forced to live with brutal work and little money, simply go through the grinder. They are spit out for our entertainment and I've solemnly watched too many ten-bell salutes to men and women who died before their fortieth birthdays, leaving the world with cool video and little else. That's the hardest and best part of Card Subject to Change. Acid's story, as well as what turned out to be the final video interview with the legendary ""Sensational"" Sherry Martel (an incoherent and drunken piece that makes sickening sense with her death), drive home a point that I don't believe director Tim Disbrow intended, one that continues to depresses this old rasslin fan.

Cinema Libre has released a decent disc for Card Subject to Change. The image is full frame, kind of blotchy, and not that great, but I wouldn't expect more from a doc on indie wrestling; shoddy production is the name of the game. The stereo mix is fine, but nothing special. For extras, we have a few promos cut about the movie by various wrestlers, promoters, and writers. Some deleted scenes and outtakes give more info and some funny moments, especially with Terry Funk describing a moment with Sullivan surrounding his idea of using a snow shovel in the middle of July; that guy can tell a story like nobody else.

I wish Card Subject to Change was a more cohesive documentary, but the interviews and stories as they stand are still good and for fans, either those who still watch or those who are too cynical to continue, will get something out of the film.

4504036,5,B004YZ3M66,"Ive been a wrestling fan my entire life and this was a fascinating look into a small independent company based out of New Jersey by Johnny Falco. The match clips shows many former WWE, WCW, and TNA wrestlers. One of my favorite quotes from the movie is You're born on the independent circuit and that is where you die, or something along the lines of that. Some wrestlers interviewed you may know are Kamala, Kevin Sullivan, Sabu, Sherri Martel in her last interview before her untimely death, Terry Funk, and many others. This could have been put into one film and it would have been perfect. However, they also follow around Trent Acid. Acid was a wrestler who had it all but drugs kept him from making it to the big leagues and sadly he passed away. I don't mind adding him to the dvd but they could have made two different projects. I highly recommend it this wrestling fans. I hope there is a sequel.",1310860800,7,905,4.457831325301205
4504037,5,B004YZ3M66,"It is an amazing Documentary about the real behind the scenes of wrestling. From old to new fans, it is a great way to find out what this business is. Every bit of it is true.

8449076,4,B004YZ3M66,"This will mostly be appealing to pro wrestling fans. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at an indie wrestling promotion; where careers begin and end. Fans will recognize many of the established wrestlers, some legends, who appear in this documentary. It seems to have been filmed from around 2005 to 2010. Watching it, it was a little sad realizing how many of them have died since then.
Those who aren't fans of this form of entertainment may still find this entertaining. It's a glimpse into the lives of some very unique people. People who participate in a one-of-a-kind form of live entertainment that is very dangerous. It's so much more than ""fake"" fighting.",1473033600,,664,4.9375

8449082,5,B004YZ3M66,"Through various wrestlers this movie take you through the career and life of a professional wrestler.  With all the highs and lows, and nothing edited.  While the director tried to focus mainly on the ""pro wrestling's underground"" and indy scene, he ended up providing a clear picture of the entire industry.

If you are a fan of the sport, or ever thought about steping in the ring yourself, you need to watch this movie!",1349049600,4,422,4.675675675675675
