8761530,1,B01FTFD0PC,"I think David Bowie was a musician that brought fun, derring-do and laughter to a staid musical format. His earlier experiments in musical roots laid the foundation fro the volcanic-spring of his future motherlode. His Man of Words Man of Music album was quite seminal for his further explorations. The Man Who Sold the World extended his breach and widened his philosophical thought. Hunky Dory was even MORE revelationary as it took his erstwhile concerns and blended a more contemplative interpretation to his concerns; Queen Bitch is a raucous romp through the skyline of New York(?) trailing the Velvet Underground. Then came the meisterwerk: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. It's a Concept album without a concept in any traditional way, albeit has the titular character throughout. Aladdin Sane was followed by the terrific Diamond Dogs.
This dvd, being American, is obsessed with the album that broke him in the States: Young Americans. Maybe it's because it has their name in the title. Personally I regard this album as a throw-away; even the singles from it are lacklustre. This dvd goes for approximately one hour and mostly about this album alone. The rest of his career is slightly (criminally) regarded - save Let's Dance. If some real time was given to Station to Station and his ""Berlin Trilogy"" it might have redeemed this dvd. Alas, it did not.
If Bowie is of real interest to you find this in a library for free because it is NOT worth a nickel of your time.",1523145600,,1508,4.826254826254826
