8550794,3,B00AF4OR0A,"This is a great compacted version of the ESPN broadcast, without the commercials.  The problem is, the crowd noise is considerably subdued compared to the original broadcast.  Announcers almost sound like they're in a private room all by themselves.  Loses a lot of the excitement of the game.",1362441600,2,293,5.0625

8550796,1,B00AF4OR0A,It is 2013 and there is not a bluray disc being produced of the Allstate Sugar Bowl.  This is a crying shame that Team Marketing and Wax Works Inc will not produce the bluray of this game.,1361232000,3,188,4.081081081081081
