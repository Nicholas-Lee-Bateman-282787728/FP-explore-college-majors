It seems as if scenes were omitted from this version but most of the story remains. It has one of the classic stories where there is a land swindle, the important citizen in town is in cahoots with the crooked sheriff and his bad guys. But it all ends well for the good guys. One feature is how Lambert wants to control communications with the outside world for his benefit. Who controls your newspaper and broadcast stations? Red Ryder began as a newspaper comic strip in the late 1930's and lasted until 1964. Many comic strips from that time are also gone.",1511049600,,2740,4.441351888667992
