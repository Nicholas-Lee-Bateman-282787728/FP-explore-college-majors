5860051,5,B00DW5ILF6,"In the early 1970's thanks to Masterpiece Theater Americans were learning much about the Parliamentary system in Great Britain's  Victorian age.  This dramatization of Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels delivered a heady blend of social science, political science and human nature that captured the imaginations of the viewers through twists and turns of stories that were the Monday morning discussions in many workplaces.  This production has held up well, it is a delight to follow again the lives of the irrepressible Lady Glencora (played by the incomparable Susan Hampshire) and her husband the staid aristocratic Plantagent Palliser (Philip Latham), as they rise to social and political heights, overcoming personal and emotional hurdles.  With these two at the center, the production branches out to tell stories of those within their social set, or environment, broadening the picture of the time and how people lived.  This was a huge undertaking with an enormous cast whose names are familiar to fans of today's British dramas in television and film.  Thanks to Acorn Media for bringing this special edition of a much loved series to us.",1388102400,41,1148,5.314917127071824
5860052,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Sumptuous, gorgeous, and a huge bargain for the hours and hours of entertainment. And, for once, the sound is great. Watch for some of your old favorite Brits to turn up unexpectedly... Like Penelope Wilton from The Norman Conquests",1387324800,13,232,4.9743589743589745
5860053,5,B00DW5ILF6,"This is a fine adaptation of six of my favorite Trollope novels and I've always loved it since it was first broadcast.  In addition to an intelligent script it has many outstanding actors, including, just for example, Susan Hampshire and Jeremy Irons, and sumptuous sets.  They don't make television series like this any more.  Nobody has the money for it.

I bought the original set of 12 DVD's many years ago.  In recent years my hearing has declined to the point where I can't always understand what the characters are saying, which makes it hard to enjoy watching them.  I was delighted when Acorn Media recently released this new set of DVD's that includes subtitles, and I ordered it in advance from Amazon.

I'm happy to say that the new set is exactly as advertised.  It's all here; the only difference is the addition of English subtitles that can be turned on or off.  The disks include a disclaimer apologizing for any lapses in picture or sound quality which may be caused by the age of the original material.  In my opinion the disclaimer is entirely unnecessary; the picture and sound are perfect.",1383523200,136,1111,4.709844559585492
5860054,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Think Pallisers as the parent of Downton Abbey. It's been 40 years since this drama first exposed TV to the delightful mix of British history, aristocracy, salivating costumes and sets, romance, and elegant despicableness, all within a series that offers characters so well defined and portrayed that they become both personal friend and foe, depending upon the scene. If you have never viewed The Pallisers, now is the opportunity to have the entire series upgraded.

What's new after 40 years? Fortunately no one messed with the content. It is 70s BBC. Being a period drama, props, sets and costumes could not be improved upon even in modern production times. The acting is stellar, another reason it was such a long-lasting hit. Watching after 40 years is as nostalgic as the content of the period portrayed.
SDH SUBTITLES are now available for those needing them. The packaging has diminished 85% (26 episodes on 8 discs in a 1-inch case). The price is a fraction of the original. Over 22 hrs, do the math; it's a value for period pomp & pageantry.

NAME DROPPING series. Many who appeared in the series are so well known they need no introduction.
Susan Hampshire is co-protagonist Lady Palliser with her sparkle that never dulls as she ages through the 20 year saga of the Victorian dynasty.
Philip Latham is perfection as statuesque proper politician Plantagenet Palliser who would become Duke.
Jeremy Irons; Derek Jacobi; Peter Vaughan; Penelope Keith; Anthony Andrews...
Anthony Trollope wrote the 6 adapted novels from 1865-1880. The series followed the books in about equal amounts. It's difficult to improve upon the greatness of Trollope.

HISTORY becomes visual as the family life is filmed secretly from within the manor walls during Queen Victoria heydays of reign, and Palliser's rise in the British Parliamentary ranks. It depicts the era when snooty was snappy. Dynasty decorum was devilishly delicious. When scandal was scintillating.

It truly is like Downton Abbey, in that no matter how many times you view it, new facets are enjoyed. Upstairs, Downstairs and Brideshead Revisited are other period series comparables. There is just too much cinematography excellence to capture the visuals at once. Too much artistry dialogue to muster into consciousness immediately. Too much emotion to experience simultaneously without heart failure.
The reasons why THE PALLISERS is on my list of TOP TV SERIES OF BRITAIN'S CENTURY.
If you have read this far you probably understand I really, really like this series.",1379030400,143,2527,5.15609756097561

5860056,3,B00DW5ILF6,"Bottom line first, I enjoyed reading the six Pallser novels more than watching them. It was interesting to compare the problems of writing to a contract that required each book to be 80 chapters and several 100 pages, as opposed to the problem of crushing those thousands of odd pages of reading into 8 hours of programming. But mostly I felt that the director made it hard for the characters to live and breathe. I get that the period being portrayed was one of reserve and the gentility of the gentles required much of that stiff upper lip stuff, but too many of these people seemed stuffed. For something advertised as an Anniversary edition the lack of festive or almost any bonus content was underwhelming.

I had started watching the 40th Anniversary Edition of The Pallisers after having read the first two of the 6 novels. I got further ahead in the reading when I discovered that disk 5 had a major crack. The seller (themediaoutlet) made a one for one replacement with zero fuss, but this was well outside the time limit to give them the credit deserved. As is I finished the books and the set within a few weeks of each other.

Over all I think a good job was done in skipping non-essential characters and thinning out/compressing plot lines. I have a major problem with the decision near the end to allow the actors to have a major dramatic scene, one that was distinctly not in the books. But that scene fell flat. It added little to the emotional depth of the story and the time could have been better used.

The Pallisers is not just another Victorian era costume drama. It is almost a polite soap opera, except that the original author, Anthony Trollope was a better than average writer and very insightful in his treatment of a number of complexities in the life among the titled and political.

It is important to recognize that while we are watching the story of the very rich and politically powerful Pallisers, one to become Duke Omnium and Gatherum ( Duke of everything and getting more), all of the major characters work and many are on the edge between maintaining social standing and not being able to keep in high society.

This is not another series about people with too much time and nothing to do except seek out marriages that grantee that they will never need to do anything.

Much is made that this is a story about British politics of the period, but the real politics are the politics of the heart and the family.

This is a very genteel story, no language or sex and almost no violence. Technically it is the very model of family friendly, but I cannot imagine the younger ones having the patience to sit through 8 CDs. I am glad I have the set, but it is hard to think of when I will sit through it all again. If you are a Trollope fan, maybe you can rent it once before adding the CDs to your shelves.",1518048000,2,2839,4.469111969111969
5860057,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Still relevant politics from insider view appealingly ornamented with Victorian style, drama, & romance by Anthony Trollope, a Brit contemporary of Charles Dickens and friend of Thackery, who was experienced of Ireland too, and a keen rider to hounds. Amid castles, costumes, & carriages, the central character of this excellent casting (necessarily for us to stay with the ride through this lengthy saga increasingly endearing) unusually a female--for that era of emerging suffrage of women's rights to inherit & own property and vote--is so charismatically portrayed by Emmy-winning ""diamond of the first water"" BBC actress Susan Hampshire (""The First Churchills,"" ""Vanity Fair"") that modern political wives and I politically active online & by purse hold Lady Glencora a model of femininely intelligent passionate energy effectively enhanced by ladylike charm & grace confirmed authentic to Susan too by interview in bonus material, which includes a paper booklet orienting you to this grand family of the great olden days & ""old ways.""

The political slant of the Trollope novels is bearable for the other end of the spectrum by making gods of no characters, allowing some consequences, and portraying good intentions that we schooled by history knowing its later proven shortcomings can maturely entertain like a parent with a child of whom we are--to borrow Trollope's words--""amusedly deprecating."" And by Trollope presenting the demanding but in more ways admirable culture at Brittania's Victorian zenith, patriotic nationalism and the wistful wish that more had been conserved are unintentionally stimulated as a takeaway for the West & appreciators.

I shall enjoy revisiting the DVDs now with broader acquaintance from reading the included booklet I recommend before watching the 8 DVD set, if not also Trollope's novels the production faithfully depicts. I hope you enjoy too.",1516924800,2,1889,5.487972508591065

5860059,4,B00DW5ILF6,"The enactment of the Palliser novels follows the books very closely, which is a great advantage. The casting seems strange until I get used to the fact that the director's notion of the character is different than mine and they grow on me. The biggest difficulty is the accent, which requires turning the volume way up and listening very carefully. It definitely helps to have read the books.",1513641600,,392,4.779411764705882

5860063,4,B00DW5ILF6,"If you like British period series, this is worthwhile to add to your collection.  It took me a while to get into the characters (the wife's mannerisms were a little weird in a playful way and the husband not at all attractive) but they all grew on me and I ended up with an affection for all.  The series quickly takes us from the youthful beginnings of their marriage where in those days and in that circle people married, not for love, but for what would be most beneficial socially.  Each is in love with another but are open and honest about that while being physically faithful to each other and honoring their vows.  They learn to love each other as the years roll by.  By the time the series ends, their children have all grown up and become betrothed to others.  The series carries the viewer along on the ups and downs of an arranged marriage, the loneliness at times, the growth from immaturity of youth to the settling in that comes with years of companionship.  And in the end they do love each other----not with an infatuation but a mature love that comes with endurance and facing challenges together.  All in all a series that I have already watched a second time and will do so again.",1505952000,,1200,4.447488584474886
5860064,5,B00DW5ILF6,"This set displayed a disclaimer pointing out that video from the 1970s was not what it is today, but I believe the original series must have been filmed, because the quality is really very good.  I've only viewed the first episode so far, but it's English actors, so every line sounds better than Trollope wrote it, and Trollope wrote it well.  I enjoyed it when it was originally broadcast; I'm rereading the novels, and I expect to enjoy the videos all over again.",1505347200,,466,4.602409638554217
5860065,5,B00DW5ILF6,"This is a very enjoyable BBC series from the 1970's.  It has much of the charm and pageantry of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" but focuses mainly on the upper classes in Great Britain.  The main exception is the Irish-born character who becomes a lawyer and member of parliament and wangles his way into favor with uppercrust English society.  Through his eyes and experiences, Americans can draw some greater appreciation of the difficult lives all had to lead back in Victorian times.  (Public hygiene and health care were mostly wishful thinking back then for everyone). This BBC production does have subtitles which are almost indispensable to an American audience because so many of the British sayings and idiom are hard to follow.  At times you might wonder if the characters were speaking Chinese. The series has a bit of a soap opera aspect to it which some may not like; but it definitely appealed to my wife who loved ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" ""The Barchester Chroicles,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" and other like productions.  Susan Hampshire is the lead star and is great in the Lady Palliser role she was given, as she was in ""Barchester.""  The latter series may be a bit better because of its many moral messages and outstanding cast, but ""The Pallisers"" is quite good in its own right.  That's  despite a bittersweet ending.  We highly recommend this vintage BBC series.",1504742400,,1366,4.951754385964913

The six books are all 600+ pages each, so you can't get everything.  My main quibble is with the actors chosen to play some of the characters.

These discs are in 4:3 with clear subtitles available. The video quality is superb. I watched it in a dark room on a 70"" HDTV from about 12' away, and felt like I was in a theater. The dark room makes you forget the stripes on either side caused by the 4:3 filming. The audio quality is also very good - much better than on many British productions. The only slight glitch is that the audio level on some of the introductory titles on each disc is a bit higher than the actual performance. That means that you have to turn down the volume a bit as the introductory music plays. That is a trivial issue.  All in all, we are delighted with the plot, acting, costuming, video and audio quality. Susan Hampshire is also a delight.

5860106,5,B00DW5ILF6,"I have read all six of the books in The Palliser series of novels by Anthony Trollope, one of my favorite English writers.  This 40th Anniversary Edition has eight discs divided into twenty-six individual chapters.  Each filmed chapter corresponds to a book in the six book series.  We start with Can You Forgive Her, the weakest novel in the series, in my opinion, but necessary to establish our cast of characters and one ongoing problem that remains alive and well throughout the entire series.

Lady Glencora McCluskey is in love with a ne'er-do-well named Burgo Fitzgerald, a penniless fortune seeker who schemes to elope with the young lady, who is to be married against her will to the wealthy Plantagenet Palliser, the most important and enduring character in the entire series of novels and films.  This theme of love's labor lost will continue until the last novel in the series, The Duke's Children.

In the second novel, Phineas Finn, the Irish member of Parliament, the story and films become genuinely interesting.  Finn is an engaging and energetic young man liked by Lady Glencora and Plantagenet and taken up by them.  Finn is loved by some and hated by others.  His adventures give the entire series continuity and genuine interest.

Plantagenet Palliser, our most important character and good friend to Finn, is a member of the House of Commons; it is fair to say that the entire series of Palliser novels may be called political in nature as can all the films in the series.  Plantagenet is nephew to the Duke of Omnium, an old man and one of the wealthiest people in England.  The Duke intends to make Plantagenet his heir and Lady Glencora worries that the Duke's attachment to one Madame Max Goesler may put those plans in jeopardy.  Like Finn, Madam Max becomes an ongoing player in all the novels and discs of the films.

We take a side step with the third novel and discs in the films with The Eustace Diamonds.  Some humor is provided in this interlude as Lady Eustace attempts to keep diamonds left to her by her dead husband.  More important than the diamonds is the introduction of one of the villains in the series, the Reverend Mr. Emilius.  He will figure prominently in the story and films when we begin the next novel and film chapters called Phineas Redux (Latin for again).

Finn is accused of murdering a hated enemy in Parliament, a Mr. Bonteen.  The trial of Finn is genuinely interesting from beginning to end.  No spoilers here.  The reader of this review must read the book or see the films to find out what happens.

Politics takes front and center with the fifth book and series of films with The Prime Minister.  Plantagenet becomes Prime Minister of England, the highest office in the land and now Lady Glencora, who has become Duchess of Omnium, is at the center of all the entertainments Plantagent, the newly made Prime Minister and Duke of Omnium, must give to manage the political scene and his constituents.

In the final book and series of films, The Duke's Children, twenty-five years have passed and now the duke's children take center stage as we close this engaging and entertaining story of the Pallisers.  We have watched the Lady Glencora mature as an individual as she comes to truly know and love her husband, one of the finest men in England.  Plantagenet Palliser may be a bit of a stuffed shirt, and he is, but he is a stuffed shirt who is a genuinely hard working, competent man who has the best interest in the people of England in his mind and heart and works tirelessly in their behalf.

This brief summary of almost six thousand pages of reading material and twenty-six evenings of watching each episode of the series gives the readers of this long review, my apologies, a good idea about what to expect if they decide to buy this series, as I did, a good decision on my part, I think.

The filmmakers have lavished time and expense on everything related to this production.  We step back in time one hundred and fifty years to the England of Queen Victoria.  The sets, the costumes, the physical locations are all meticulously prepared to allow us viewers the feeling that we are actually experiencing what it might be like to live in Victorian England.

As mentioned, the story is often compelling.  We are able to take a genuine interest in some of the characters, particularly Phineas Finn, and we have plenty of time to watch as they resolve their many problems.  The acting is also excellent in every respect and the cast of characters is large, but never are we confused in any way by what is happening to them over the twenty-five years of the story.

I thought the transfer of film to DVD was competent.  The producers of this Anniversary Edition warn us that we will not have the clarity we expect with high definition television, and this is correct.  That said, I thought the color, definition, and sound were good enough not to distract me from the ongoing story.

What impresses me most about this Anniversary Edition of The Palliser's is the faithfulness of the adaptation to Anthony Trollope's six Palliser novels.  Never once did I think that the producers were taking liberties with the story.  If anyone reading this review thinks that he/she will not be reading the six thousand pages of the novels but still wants to become acquainted with Trollope's ongoing story of the Pallisers, this series of films does justice to Trollope's vision for this major work of English literature.  Highly recommended.",1432512000,9,5493,4.7289915966386555

It does drag a bit in places, but if you can get thru those scenes and watch the whole series, I know you will love it like you may love the Upstairs Downstairs series.  The costumes in this series were done exquisitely!

5860137,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Without question, this is among the finest British TV series ever to cross the Atlantic, matched only by the likes of Brideshead Revisited, Pride and Prejudice, and a few others.  Susan Hampshire and Philip Latham are perfectly cast in the principal roles, and it's great fun to see Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews before they became household names even in the U.S..  This is a production of Trollope stories not to be missed by anyone who loves English literature and British TV.  It is still fresh decades after its first viewing.",1418860800,4,548,4.870967741935484

5860154,5,B00DW5ILF6,"I saw this series way back on Masterpiece Theatre in the 70's. Loved it and the price was prohibitive when I added it to my wish list but when it came down I knew it was time to buy it.

I recognized the music the moment the 1st DVD started playing.....I hardly remember most of it the story but I do remember Mr. Palliser & Glencora's rather bad match-up and arranged marriage troubles at the beginning. I'm getting acquainted with the story all over again. Susan Hampshire is adorable as a young Glencora and we get to watch her grow up before our very eyes. She steals your heart from the opening scenes. When you see tears streaming down her face at the wedding you cry with her.....The story is interesting with plenty of romance, adventure and a bit of heartbreak too.

Can't believe the amazing costumes and attention to detail, including the interesting way people used the word 'ain't' in proper England....

The acting is wonderful but the character development is slow and she can't seem to watch 30 minutes without falling asleep.  At least we can turn it on when she's having trouble sleeping.

The story was a bit odd to me when it began but it wasn't long before I adapted to the style of the show and I became addicted to it! The clothing, hairstyles, customs and scenery are true to the period it is set in. There is an option for subtitles which I found helpful when the style of speech was unusual or the accents were strong. I was not familiar with Susan Hampshire before this but I found her to be a remarkable actress and I will be a forever fan of hers. Ditto for Philip Latham. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because it seems somewhat primitively made compared to what is being produced now.

It was very sad to see how much importance was placed on money and position when choosing a marriage partner among the aristocrats in England.

5860181,5,B00DW5ILF6,"I've been a Trollope fan for years, and have nothing but praise for this adaptation of his Palliser series of novels.  Easy to follow even if one has never heard of Trollope, it was certainly one of BBC's best.",1393372800,,210,4.384615384615385
5860182,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Although this is a very loose adaptation of 5 thick and satisfying novels by Trollope, it stands alone in many ways.  In the novels, although characters such as Glencora and Planty Palliser do not appear so often, they are created as the main characters in this adaptation, around whom the action evolves and thus it makes a cohesive story.  If you have read the Palliser novels you will probably be appalled at the omissions of so much which was essential.  However, this does not diminish the acting and ambience of this rambling but at the same time interesting look at the 19th century world.  Trollope presents a view of that world which I believe is both believable and at the same time often humorous.  Susan Hampshire shines in this, the costumes and sets are wonderful, and many of the characters unforgettable, such as Phineas Finn, the Duke of St. Bungay, and the wonderful Aunts trying to rein Glencora in when she is going astray with her handsome and penniless suitor.  The Dukes of Omnium both uncle and nephew Plantaganet, are both beautifully drawn, the older one an old roue who lives for pleasure, and the younger husband of Glencora serious, good, and somewhat of a fool.  There are 16 episodes in this set, and they only cover the tip of these interesting novels which present yet another view of the Empire and of Victorian society at the height.  The character of Lizzie Eustace is sadly miscast and her story is misrepresented the most in this production, but I still recommend this screen version with five stars.",1393200000,2,1538,4.7556390977443606
5860183,4,B00DW5ILF6,"Have been watching this classic since it was shown on pbs in the seventies.  Watch it every few years, but hearing the dialogue was getting difficult so CC addition has been wonderful.  This series along with the Barchester Chronicles introduced me to Trollope's novels.  Have almost read his entire works now.  Highly recommend.  Less one star for the video for the occasional CC error.",1393113600,,387,4.984375
5860184,5,B00DW5ILF6,"Although it sometimes shows it age, this series is one of the best things the BBC/Masterpiece Theater ever did.  It is certainly one of the biggest; by comparison, ""Brideshead Revisted"" is short.  The cast is huge and the acting mostly excellent.  The two central characters, Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Glencora, are particularly well-taken by Phillip Latham and Susan Hampshire.  Hampshire's character starts out as a rather featherbrained, shallow flibbertigibbit and, over the course of the series, deepens into a character of real substance and strength - not above some upper-class manipulation and chicanery when the circumstances seem to require it.  Latham has an even tougher job, as his character is rather dour, stuffy and unappealing right from the start when he is relatively young.  ""Planty Pal"" (as Dolly Longstaff calls him), like Glencora, becomes a very complex and interesting character and eventually one feels both admiration and affection for him.  Honor and personal integrity are everything to him.  If we find him a bit stuffy, perhaps it is because those admirable qualities are not as much esteemed today.  So much the worse for us.

The secondary characters are very well-cast and include such luminaries as Derek Jacobi, Anna Massey, Lockwood West, Fabia Drake and Donald Eccles.  Very young Anthony Andrews and Jeremy Irons, later paired so memorably in ""Brideshead Revisted,"" play important parts in the later episodes.  Donald Pickering is another standout as Dolly Longstaff, who acts as a kind of Greek Chorus observer and commentator throughout the series.  Other treats are Roger Livesay as the Duke of St. Bungay and Ronald Culver as the genteelly lecherous Duke of Omnium and Gatherum (what a title!).

The numerous story lines are not all of equal interest.  The best include the Eustace Diamonds and the trial of Phineas Phinn.  The whole Plantagenet-As-Prime-Minister series is good.  Alice Vavasour's romantic travails are a bit tedious, as are parts of the Ferdinand Lopez episodes.

The production is mostly excellent if a bit dated.  The costumes are wonderful, although Victorian couture was not one of the great eras in fashion history.  The sets, on the other hand, sometimes have a bargain basement feel, particularly the scenes in Switzerland (painfully obvious painted backdrops), but they can also be very impressive, such as the Palliser homes interiors.  There is also a lot of well-chosen location shooting.

The most un-modern thing about ""The Pallisers"" is that it takes its time in telling the many stories.  To some, this will be a disadvantage.  For me, it is one of the series' great merits.",1392854400,3,2659,5.216981132075472
