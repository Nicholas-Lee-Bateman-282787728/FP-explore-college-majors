2159176,3,B00062IDCO,"The idea was good, the Delta quadrant had potential, and the series were a pass backward of the epic DS9, but however they didn't used it for the rivalry of a better share. The result: a serie that loses in himself. Sometimes weak in its evolution where the Borg become far less dark and dangerous than the previous series, where was used a fully capable Borg as an averaged capable crewmember in some episodes (so fast for my taste), and the worst, where lacks in the previously created universe by ST:DS9(the same fault carried by ""Enterprise"" about the whole ST historical universe, but that they can still solve. I hope. I prey.)

Anyway If you never saw ST:NG or/and ST:DS9 and you don't want to do it. Then ST:Voyager can be entertaining, otherwise I can't recomend other than ST(for lovers of the old stuff), ST:NG or ST:DS9.",1096934400,5,832,4.659863945578231
2159177,4,B00062IDCO,"This was a damn fine season, the final one.

We saw the characters Paris and Torres get married - Torres becomes pregnant.

It seems that Seven of Nine will die, when her 'cortical node' malfunctions, in a sequel to an earlier episode.

We meet Klingons who've been lost in the Delta Quantrant for many, many years (their ancestors before them) and don't know of any treaty between Klingons and Humans.

I thought, when this season was new, that there would be an on-going storyline throughout this season referring to just how the Voyager crew get home.  But that's not what happened -- it was all the last episode.

That episode was called ""End Game"" - which I might buy this box set just for the episode.  The episode starts out about 20 years into the future.  It's been ten years since Voyager ended it's 16-year voyage home, where too many members of the crew were killed.  The captain (now an Admiral) makes a decision to purchase an illegal weapon, along with state-of-the-art shields, and make a voyage to the past -- to bring Voyager home much earlier than the original 16 years.  Many argued (including myself) that there should have been a few extra scenes at the end of the episode, but oh well.

This box set comes out 4 days before Christmas, just in time for all those Voyager lovers, huh?",1096848000,,1305,4.581896551724138
2159178,5,B00062IDCO,"I joined the great journey of voyager for the Episode ""Rennasance Man"" (am i qualified to write this review) anyway, ever since then i watched voy any time it was on, i even stayed up till 11 if i had to. The fact is is that it is the best series. They all have their good and bad sides (enterprise is mostly bad) but voy is the best. The only mistake paramount made was waiting too long to release some of the seasons and now have to realease 2 within 2 weeks. Nice one Guys! lol",1096502400,4,480,4.010416666666667
2159179,4,B00062IDCO,"After six previous season that ranged from good to ho-hum, Star Trek Voyager final season gives us some good episodes (Shattered,Lineage, Prophecy,Human Error,Author, Author) among the less than steller (Drive,Body and Soul, Workforce, Q2,Renaissance Man).
 The finale episode Endgame, opted for an action packed finale, rather than service the crew with the kind of resolution befitting to these beloved characters of this less than stellar series.

2159181,3,B00062IDCO,"Once i got used to the new characters I really liked the show then they would go off in left field like the lizard episode. Or their memories are wiped clean and they have another life.

I liked the doctor until the last season he got increasingly more unlikable. Like calling people organic and acting all abused and oppressed. The time he wanted to be a singer and leave or the time he lied to everyone about the captains kidnapping.

And what happened to the borg queen. Did she destroy the borg. I did not like seven and chakotay either.",1512604800,,541,4.4

2159194,1,B00062IDCO,"It's like they run out of money halfway through every episode and have to hire a 9 year old to finish the scripts. Some of the actors simply phoned it in while others could barely garble out the robotic lines they are forced to deliver. A few episodes start out promising but quickly devolve into unwatchable messes, although if you stay for unintentional laughs you will usually find a few here and there. Even the morality of the series is unintentionally hilarious - I could swear the crew of the ship committed xenocide on several occasions just to save a few members of that alien population based on some completely idiotic interpretation of 20th century human morality. All in all I feel bad for the cast but worse for anyone watching this while sober.

SPOILER UPDATE:

The plot holes are so bad, especially towards the end of the series. They sent a character on the show from 23 years in the future BACK to help the crew. (SPOILER: It's Mulgrew in heavy old woman makeup.) And she comes bearing advanced weaponary, armor, technology, next gen iPads, everything. Isn't that breaking the rules of Star Trek, the Prime Directive...and good filmmaking? YUP! So, they went all out and said forget the Prime Directive - they actually say ""forget the Prime Directive"" multiple times in the last episode - and just did everything they could to make a feel good finale. Gene Roddenberry is rolling in his grave.

So of course, they get home after blowing up lots of hapless Borg and infecting them with a devastating virus that disables but won't kill them (because future revenue from Star Trek films...yeah). But here's the problem: they still have all that tech from 23 years in the future when they reach Earth! On top of that, because they reached Earth, the person who brought them the tech from that future shouldn't ever have existed. How did they get the tech if she never existed? So not only is there a massive, headache inducing paradox but also the crippling reality of introducing advanced technology to the entire Star Trek universe. This is like giving one side in WW1 all the weapons and technology from WW2. It's a slaughter, both figuratively and literally - from here on out the Federation will likely mop the floor with any and all alien species in the galaxy without breaking a sweat. Unless they choose to destroy the future tech. Which they won't because ""forget the Prime Directive"".

Overthinking this a bit? Maybe. But if they spent as much on writing the script as they did on special effects (they were REALLY expensive back in the day), there wouldn't be so many terrible plotholes destroying everything Roddenberry's vision of the future stood for.",1494892800,,2680,4.769396551724138
2159195,4,B00062IDCO,Great show. Like all the treks some misses. But on a whole enjoyable fun with great acting. Fun stories. Wish they would sell all the 2 parters in all the series. Highly entertaining!!,1493596800,,184,4.606060606060606
2159196,5,B00062IDCO,"I've always love Star Trek in its many forms, even Voyager.

The ending felt more like it was open ended, I wanted to see the ramifications of Janesways actions, introduce Seven to the Federation and how they deal with it. As a Delta Quadrant enemy of theirs, either the Hunters or one of the many advance species they encountered tries to attack the star fleet.",1491350400,,362,4.569230769230769

2159199,4,B00062IDCO,"Face it, if you've watched Seasons 1-6 then nothing said here is going to stop you from watching Season 7. I just wish I could endorse it more enthusiastically. My star rating is more accurately 3.51 stars, just crossing the barrier from OK to I like it. This season has more misses than hits. I wouldn't mind the abrupt changes in some of the characters (The Doctor, Tuvok and Tom in particular), if they arose from a good story. In this season it seems like the characters (maybe the actors themselves) are driving the stories - and producing a weaker result. Even if those problems had been fixed it would have little effect on my rating because I was so disappointed in the finale, End Game. [SPOILER ALERT] In Season 1, Episode 1, the writers planted what I thought was the seed for the finale by having the Caretaker disclose that he had been abandoned at the Ocampa home planet by a second, female caretaker who went looking for a more interesting adventure in the Delta quadrant. Given the fundamental ""girl power"" themes of Voyager, it was reasonable to expect Mrs. Caretaker to have some critical role in getting Voyager home. But she never appears in the finale. Instead the path is through the Borg (a TNG creation) and a frustratingly sloppy time paradox. The final scene is a colossal disappointment both for weak dialog and bad science. [END SPOILER ALERT]

The best episodes of Season 7 included:

Episode 5 - Critical Care:  An exploration of equal access to health care brought about by the Doctor's kidnapping. Normally when the Voyager writers decide to confront a social or moral issue, the opposing points of view are presented pretty evenhandedly. Examples include suicide, nuclear war, bioethics and the Prime Directive. Its rare to see a one sided presentation like this one, but it works anyway.

Episode 15 - The Void: The tenth of my Voyager Top Ten.  Excellent lesson on the value of community and the discovery that individually we have more to contribute to society than we may realize.

Episode 23 - Homestead: Don't want to say much other than this was just a perfect sending off episode for the Neelix character. Far better than Kes' farewell.

The worst episodes of Season 7 (there are many weak ones) included:

Episode 4  Repression: Of all the characters who might be chosen for remote mind control or cult religion, Tuvok would be the least believable and yet here we go. One of the prime examples of going to far in the wrong direction with a well developed character.

Episode 6  Inside Man: The Ferengi are meant to represent 20th century capitalist Earth (with better technology). In Deep Space Nine they are easily manipulated. Here they show up as super villains. Times have certainly changed.

Episode 11  Shattered: It's just a highlight show of seasons past. The writers took a week off I guess.

Episode 19  Q2: The omniscient, indomitable Q apparently have Earth style children when they procreate. Of course, the Q are incapable of understanding basic parenting because of some secret limitation in their powers. No need to worry. A couple spankings from Aunt Janeway and everything is solved. Groan.

Episodes 25 & 26 End Game: see above for my explanation of its many failures. Maybe some day a movie version will be released and correct this injustice.",1489449600,,3306,4.804232804232805

2159329,4,B00062IDCO,"I think that it's well established that Voyager is the least liked of all the Star Trek TV series. I agree. It missed the mark in many ways, chiefly by not really exploring the situation of being hopelessly lost 60,000 light years from home. No matter how badly Voyager was damaged, she was always ship-shape and Bristol fashion in time for the next episode. Voyager also seemed to have more techo-babble and ""particle of the week"" BS that the rest of the series combined.

That being said, the last couple of seasons were the best. The loss of Kes and the addition of Seven of Nine helps a lot. The character of the Doctor grew into the most interesting of the crew.

I doubt if many (if any) fans would rather Voyager at the top of the Trek heap, but it's definitely worth a look, if you can get through the first couple of seasons.",1474848000,,834,4.374193548387097

2159390,5,B00062IDCO,"I like this series, and it had the kind of ending you want on TV. I loved the characters and the fact that we didn't have to get caught up in too much infighting--there was too much real fighting going on for the crew to hate each other too. I liked that part of it the most. Most of this series is about adventure and meeting new species, the prime directive. Janeway was focused on a few too many personal quests, putting the crew in unnecessary danger over and over again, but that's always the case with Star Trek. She remained professional and true to her character, almost never doubting herself throughout the entire series. She was surrounded by the perfect crew, loyalists, but each individuals--the kind of team a real star exploration company would want to employ. She got to help a few species out, though not as much as the other Star Trek series. It's always somethin' with Star Trek, but overall this was a good season and a good series..",1469145600,,953,4.514450867052023

2159396,4,B00062IDCO,"Wonderful show.  Watched from Season 1 through 7 over a couple months.  Liked the way they shifted the focus between lead actors during various episodes to provide bit of character development.  Would give a five except for a few goofy guest stars and an occasional ridiculous plot.  Follows Star Trek's obsession with time travel which in general I find a bit implausible.  However its use in a latter episode (Season 7) was an interesting twist.  Scripts were very good, crew constantly coming up with ingenious solutions to impossible problems.  While guiding principles were diplomacy and peaceful solutions there were enough phaser blasts and photon torpedoes to make you think someone from Star Wars was helping with the script.

2159502,5,B00062IDCO,"The memory of near 20 years ago was correct! Acting which ranged from ""good"" to ""excellent"" gave this show so many layers that it can re ""new"" even after decades and even when watched several times.

Kate Mulgrew especially brought so many shades to her role the simplest lines like ""All right. Dismissed."" Make us see many emotions going unvoiced by her character.

The fact is that she is not alone! The series regulars, with a couple exceptions, equal her. And the guest stars nearly always met the same high standards. Their roles here were better played than in other vehicles. That can only be because of the work of writers, directors and others creating an atmosphere of quality!",1462406400,3,687,4.764705882352941

Q shows back up and after babysitting his son, who was supposed to be the savior of the Q but isn't exactly working out that way, they get new information to take them closer to home ... but never seems to use it. Come on Janeway, grow a pair and tell Q that you straightened out his brat, take us home. Seven spends hours in the holodeck fawning over a holographic Chacotay and mysteriously a couple episodes later they're on their third date ... wait what?? They stumble onto a group of Talaxians thousands of light years away from Talaxian space in an asteroid and he happens to fall in love with the first one he meets. Surprise!! Her husband was killed leaving her and her son available for him to move in. Seriously? Between the last disc and the one before that I wondered if I'd gotten a raw deal and was missing a disc. They go from 30,000 light years from Earth to hey, we're home! Been here for 10 years ... but that's not good enough for Admiral Janeway, noooo she's gotta defy the temporal time initiative and go back to save Voyager from another 16 year trip. WTF?!?! Why not go back to before the caretaker and never start it to begin with? Very, very, very rushed ending. It felt like the writers just said okay, we're done. End this, and threw something together to be done with it. The crew doesn't even seem happy to be headed towards Earth. They've been gone for 7 years people! A little celebrating and embracing is called for, not 'I'll send you my report' and robot faces. Tom wasn't even there for the birth of his daughter, the quarter Klingon messiah (different ridiculous episode), he was piloting Voyager through a Borg transwarp hub. They blow up a Borg cube from INSIDE ... and not a scratch on Voyager. I call BS. If I could give it a 0 star I would.

They started strong, though I feel they could have run across the Zero Borg a little more here and there. Been a great one off or follow up.
Seven faces a grizzly fate. We see love birds finally tie the knot. They do a exploration of the old Maquis v. Starfleet beef. We see the Hirogen again. Though the episode feels out of place, it's a great little exploration. Workforce was a little bit bland for my taste but overall, a decent episode. We see Q again. The Doctor has some great development as does Seven, though some of it is a bit repetitive. Neelix's episode was almost heartbreaking. There's a moment at the end where Tuvok will make you laugh and cry.

Our favorite character has to be Seven of Nine.  It was so interesting to see a Borg be liberated and it made for a lot of very interesting, thought provoking episodes.  Being in a brand new quadrant of space introduced us to new species, another thing that made Voyager such a great series.  Just like the people on Voyager, we as viewers want to explore new things, meet new races.

When my kids were young, Voyager was already in re-runs and every day my husband and I would tape an episode at midnight on our VHS.  That evening, we'd all watch the episode after dinner together.  No Amazon Prime back then, we had to wait until the next day.  Eventually we started watching it during dinner because none of us could wait to find out what happened next.

2159599,5,B00062IDCO,I feel that season seven may have been the best. It was the last season so the show runners could take risks they otherwise couldn't take in an earlier season. The episode that shows Nelix leaving Voyager is one shining example.,1458000000,,228,4.585365853658536

We enjoy the adventures and the visuals and the values that guide the crew of Voyager as they go from one challenge to the next. The Voyager series has been a very current show although produced 20 years ago. It has presented some of the better qualities of humanity on the screen of space exploration - qualities which we somehow seem to have lost confidence in today.",1455580800,,533,4.5625

For those of you who enjoy solid character development mixed with a little syfy, you will like this series. This is my favorite of all the Star Treks. Season 7 touches on many topics relevant to life while not getting preachy. Nearly every plot carries secondary meaning. On occasion, you will even laugh out loud.

There was no need to exploit the physical characteristics of 7 of 9 just to draw more young guys to the show; and spend more than a 1.5 seasons on this character; it was shallow and very disappointing. Many of the characters were selfish and self-serving, for example, Janeway and Chakotay violated the prime directive and the temporal directive many times for personal gain/self-interest. The overall writing and character development was shallow and fell far short from the other series in terms of quality, writing, use of theoretical physics, character development, and plot development. I only gave it a 3/5 because of my love for the Star Trek brand.",1441065600,,732,5.008196721311475

2160379,4,B00062IDCO,"A FUN CONCLUSION

Voyager is classic sci-fi. It's not the best installment of the Trek universe, but it's amazingly good science fiction.

The show has 1 obvious story arc from start to finish, about the Voyager trying to travel the full length of the galaxy to get back to Earth. But along the way they have plenty of mini adventures where the crew has to pull together despite their differences because they only have each other to rely on. That's the magic of Voyager. The main story arc is ever present but each episode is it's own story.

They face old foes like the Borg (who are everywhere) and friends like Q (because what's a Trek series without Q) and lots of new ones that they meet along the way. The individual episodes remind me of 1950's and 60's sci fi stories, only with much high production value.

Season 7 brings the series to a conclusion. The only down side is that the conclusion is fairly abrupt. It answers the question ""Do they get home?"" but then immediately the credits roll and the series is over. You'd like a little epilog to the story, but you don't get it. Still, it's a good show.

Voyager is a fun departure from the Trek series that proceeded it. It's still ""Spacehip flying around meeting aliens"" but it's not constantly arguing with the Klingons and Romulans.

It's well worth watching for the fun ride it is.

2160498,5,B00062IDCO,"this is for Voyager,all seasons. Let me tell you a story. I was a ""Star Trek"" purist who was loyal to the original series and didn't give any of the spin offs a chance. Well, I got over myself 25 years later ,and I love the cast of Voyager ! The whole crew works perfectly together. The stories,9 out 10, were extremely well written, and I watched them back-to-vack for the last month or so. I didn't like Neelix at first, I thought his charectar was gay,a reverse role model for the meek and easily intimidated but ok so what, with the technology and futuristic psychological adaptations from a holographic doctor, he could have easily had his a**hole removed and lived a normal culinary function as a alien chef who does away-missions. But Tuvak made a great Vulcan and my favorite charectar B'anna Taurus. So on  to Deep Space Nine,which I also hadn't watched for the same reason.",1428796800,,883,4.5886075949367084

2160502,4,B00062IDCO,"One of the reasons ""Star Trek: Voyager"" was successful and is still worth watching is the fantastic interaction between the cast; excellent actors all.  Though some story lines in the Star Trek universe must inevitably overlap, having a different cast facing the issues of travel in a starship, especially when they make this world seem so believable, keeps them fresh.  Kate Muldrew is excellent as Captain Janeway, Robert Piccardo as the holographic doctor is a delight, and you can't get much closer to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, than the talent of Tim Russ as Tuvok.",1428537600,,566,5.01063829787234

2160532,5,B00062IDCO,"I took the whole series for what it was Science Fiction. With that said I never thought of myself as a science fiction fan but my daughter and husband recommended this one because they thought that I might enjoy the strong female lead and non-violent lean.

It took about 2-3 episodes and I was hooked. There were a couple of weak episodes but all & all I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every one for all seasons. The writing is refreshing and intelligent. The crew isn't always grabbing for their guns and looking for excuses to blow someone up. Instead you watch them work together and develop adult relationships. Its the only way you could survive if you had to live together under such close quarters for decades!

Anyway its a fun series to watch character development without the heavy, convoluted baggage that so many series bring into their writing. Sure there are holes in some of the logic but as I said in the beginning, its Science Fiction!

Its a keeper!",1427241600,,963,4.652941176470589
2160533,5,B00062IDCO,"A great ending to a great show. There are a few episodes that I would say are ""misses"" and I think the writers could have easily handled those situations better. Otherwise, excellent story telling, visuals, and I would have to say it's one of my favorite final chapters in Star Trek overall. The casing that holds the dvds is subpar and my first shipment was actually broken to the point that shards of plastic were floating around inside the shrink wrapping, scratching the cds.

2160652,5,B00062IDCO,Still good after all these years....,1418515200,,36,5.166666666666667
2160653,4,B00062IDCO,"The best seasons of ""Voyager"" are Seasons 5 and 6. Bookending those two amazing seasons are Season 4, and Season 7, which are both good, but don't have the momentum that those middle-two have. I would guess that the slowness of Season 7 is due half to a desire to focus on character development, with this being the final chapter of the story, and the writers simply running out of ideas.

And don't mistake me; there are great episodes in this season. But they are floating in a sea of slow plodding. And in some cases, the plodding is done at the wrong times. We really didn't need another rubber-forehead-douche-alien episode where Seven ""learns a lesson;"" but we really could have used a few more episodes building up her ultimate romance with Chakotay. (The two would make a really interesting pair, if only given the proper writing.)

The character development we *do* see is well done. Icheb and Janeway both demonstrate how far they'll go to save Seven in ""Imperfection."" Seven herself finally opens up to her emotions, exploring the possibilities of romance, and demonstrating guilt over her actions as a drone. Chakotay continues to be the rational glue holding this crew of weirdoes in tact, with his episodes dedicated to him trying to do just that (""Shattered"" and ""Workforce""), and he is ultimately rewarded with every fan boy's dream in ""Endgame."" (sorry J/Cers). Even the ship's two children, Naomi and Icheb, mature tremendously. Icheb starts looking out for Seven in ""Imperfection,"" and Naomi ends the series as a cool-headed preteen. But by far, the characters to go through the best changes are Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres, with their marriage and pregnancy.

Sadly, what this season has in character development, it lacks in budget. We're back to weekly rubber-forehead aliens, played by awful actors. (Not in ever case, but far too many.) The space anomalies are pretty generic for ""Star Trek,"" though many of the episodes that feature them are still good. Most of the really good aliens and guest stars are ones we're already familiar with; Klingons, Ferengi, Seska, Reg Barclay, and the Borg Queen.

The series finale, ""Endgame,"" is a fun episode and a great conclusion (unless you're a die-hard J/C shipper). But great as it was, it came out of nowhere. A few episodes of build-up would have been nice.

Some notably good episodes:
*  ""Unimatrix Zero:"" A Borg-based two-parter, and therefore a must-see
*  ""Drive:"" Tom pops the question to B'Elanna, while Harry learns his new girlfriend is evil. Nothing surprising, but still entertaining.
*  ""Repression:"" If you're a fan of the Maquis, lower-decks characters, or Tuvok going crazy,this one's a gotta-see
*  ""Human Error:"" Sweet, emotional episode for Seven, and writing Bible for the C/7 fandom
*  ""Body and Soul:"" The Doctor borrows Seven's body, and god, Jeri Ryan channels Robert Picardo's soul so well it's eerie!
*  ""Flesh and Blood:"" A two-parter where the Doc joins a cell of rogue holograms
*  ""Shattered:"" Voyager is split into a dozen time-frames, allowing Chakotay to jog through all of the show's past seasons
*  ""Lineage:"" B'Elanna learns she's pregnant, and her daddy-issues come to the surface. (This episode makes me cry. Always.)
*  ""Prophecy:"" Klingons! Klingons everywhere!
*  ""Workforce:"" Aliens brainwash the crew to think they're native to the Delta Quadrant. This episode shows what being lost took from Janeway, and what it gave Tom and B'Elanna.
*  ""Q2:"" Q has a son, and he wants Janeay to baby-sit him.
*  ""Endgame:"" The series finale

Not-so-good episodes to avoid:

*  ""Repentance:"" Preachy ""death penalty is bad"" episode, featuring guest stars who make Nicholas Cadge look like a talented actor
*  ""Friendship One:"" A race of suffering rubber-forehead aliens too lamely acted for us to care about, a threat too cliche for us to care about, and a character most people won't remember being ""killed off,"" in redshrit fashion.
*  ""Critical Care:"" Another ""moral"" episode. Something to do with health care. Or something.
*  ""Nightingale:"" Appropriately named, as most of the alien guest stars sound half-asleep.

Overall, not the best season, but not the worst either.",1418169600,,4174,5.015942028985507

2160769,5,B00062IDCO,"Intelligent, funny, sophisticated, writing!

I'm just going to assume that anyone who reads this is a fan of Star Trek, Sci-Fi and/or Kate Mulgrew. Each of these makes this show and Season 7 especially lovable. The presence of Kate Mulgrew is a huge plus because she is so talented (Orange is the New Black), but that goes for the entire crew = wonderfully cast with brilliant acting.

The narrative is great - I mean, who doesn't love a story line where you're continually engaged with the quirks and quarks of the Universe? There's nothing messy about this series (sex, drugs, rock and roll) which may lead you to think it's terribly dry and without the powers of seduction. Not so! The writers have created enough humor, passion and nuance to enliven even the cynic in me. I love the fact that they're using Iphones and Tablets far before they were invented as well as medical technology that may be viable in the 21st century.",1414368000,,930,4.664634146341464

2160798,4,B00062IDCO,"Voyager Season 7  The Final Season
The season moves quickly to wrap up details, yet also wanders due to no coherent theme other than homeward.  This gave writers and producers time to just to be creative and have fun; but with too many annoying episode surrounding The Doctor; Please, no more! (oh yeah, there are no more)

<>  Unimatrix Zero part 2  Starting with this cliffhanger was a wonderful conclusion to this bad girls Borg episode.

<>  Drive  this intergalactic race was a most memorable classic just for fun episode.  Much anticipated, Tom finally pops the question to BElanna and they get married.

<>  Q2 - Q and Son make their appearance with Aunt Kathy Q is as annoying but fun as ever.  Liked Q much better as Eugene on Days of Our Lives, and in Legend with Richard Dean Anderson (an obscure  season 1985 series).

<>  Some of the episodes like Repentance are bungled one-sided attempts to deal with social issues, thus propaganda.

<>  Homestead  we bid farewell to Nelix, the annoying little Talaxian troll we had come to love.  Hey Nelix, how about going on a diet.

<>  Endgame  oops, theyve got 1 episode till the series ends.
--  The shortcut home, Admiral Janeway violates the Temporal Prime directive; brings a bad-a shuttle to the Delta Quad; then gets assimilated and kills the Borg Queen.  Meanwhile, Chakotay an 7 are on their path to makin babies while BElanna is popin hers; sorry Captain, you didn't make your move and Tonto got away, and Harry, your just too big of a wuss for 7.
--  This final episode was much better than I remembered it.  And the very end a little better that I remember, but sill a lack-luster concluding 30 secondsshould have brought the fireworks etc., to the end, leaving with a feeling of a joyful arrival, rather than an image of well there it is, earth roll credits.

The show started to go downhill when it became a musical variety show staring Seven and the Doctor.  I counted four episodes in which the Doctor took up most of the show, four in which Seven was the main focus, and one in which they shared focus.

At one point I consulted Memory Alpha to find out where the hell Icheb was, turns out he's still on the ship just mustn't have a good singing voice.

It was nice that Neelix found somewhere to belong, he only really had Naomi Wildman left who showed him affection.

I've seen all the series from beginning to end, but this one was maybe the best, except for the original Star Trek. Loved Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway. She was really good. She was strong as the men, as committed to her crew and ideals as the men but she still kept her femininity. I loved the ending. It was action packed and touching as it should've been.

2161063,5,B00062IDCO,"Hands down some of the best storytelling in Star Trek. It goes back to the basics: space exploration... finding new worlds, making first contact, but better because they are basically on their own in the Delta Quadrant and better because of Captain Janeway. She is original in every way, like all Starfleet captains that came before her, yet she is so very unique due to their isolation. They must not merely get home, they have to survive in the 75 years it will take to get there. It's a long haul and every single crew member knows it. All of the crew have more developed and complex relationships with each other and they pick up cool characters along the way who journey with them.",1399766400,,686,4.540322580645161

Voyager however for me had a special distinction or perhaps impediment as I only watched the series only once, as the episodes aired, until now.  With TOS & NextGen of which between syndication and VHS tapes I watched each several times.  So I recently streamed the whole Voyager series and I am almost finished with season 7.  I am happily relieved to find it still fresh and enjoyable to watch.  I discovered that I missed several episodes in each season, so I am glad that I committed to doing the whole series.

Since this was a birthday gift for a friend, I am very disappointed that I had to send it back, because, another one will not get here in time.",1397520000,,367,4.027397260273973
2161113,2,B00062IDCO,"So many times in Trek there is a logical or scientific approach to (in this case) temporal mechanics that allow the viewer to follow along using their brain and it makes sense. Kirk faced The Guardian of Forever. Picard in Yesterday's Enterprise, you get the picture that good credible SF can exist in Trek, but when episodes like this one come about, the writers throw everything and anything into it, that it becomes more fantasy. Doctor Who does this shattering effect better than any. Entertaining it may be, yet when a mashup of timelines exist that would confuse even Doc Brown from Back To The Future let alone the most avid of Trekkers it destroys the premise. The reasons for criticism from those of us who are Trekkers is because we enjoy Trek, and don't feel that we should have to turn off our brain on every episode. Credible SF is what made shows like Stargate successful. Gateheads follow the science and mechanics of Stargate just like those in Star Wars and Doctor Who. Criticism of a show like Star Trek is no different. When writers abandon what has been established as canon, then the material becomes mashed up and becomes less SF and more fantasy.
Janeway decided to end it all by changing history so that the last seven years didn't happen. Even revisiting this show years later I can see why Voyager didn't stand out as well as the previous shows. I love Star Trek, but Voyager dismissed so much of the physics, the science of what made Trek credible, that it becomes nonsensical.
As so many 3-5 star ratings argue the show is entertaining, and I agree there are some decent episodes. However, after 7 years, the Doctor still has no name, Tom Paris is still a Lt., Ensign Kim has never been promoted despite having been in command. And proof that Janeway hates her crew and must proclaim herself God, by erasing the whole history and legacy of Voyager's journey. So much for Janeway's supposed ethics, let alone the viewer who watched 7 years to find out yet again, who cares about the Prime Directive. Not a soul.",1397260800,,2038,4.632596685082873

2161156,5,B00062IDCO,"The endgame, the series final is unique in the fact that holds 2 possible ending in one episode. What would happen if they continued the journey for another 16 years in conjunction with a realistic approach to the lives lose over that time period. The other was in the form of the captain going back after 16 years, at a critical point in time to return the crew back to home in the alpha quadrant, better yet Earth. The best thing about this episode is the fact that over the years the crew develop the technology to defend themselves against their greatest threat, the Borg. Endgame provides the best of both worlds to Star Trek Voyager fans. The 2 alternate ending was a very unique way of ending the series. This episode has to be one my top 5 of all time in the Star Trek universe.

I have been into Star Trek for years and out of all the serious Star Trek Voyager has always been my favorite. Like most Star Trek series the start was not great, (excluding the original series,) however character development help to make it a great series with each new episode given the time period.",1396656000,,1089,4.417910447761194

2161240,2,B00062IDCO,"I've also watched the original Star Trek, TNG and DS9 and now finally this series.  This one was the worst of the four.  I have to ask myself ""who would truly behave the way Capt. Janeway does in this series if they were lost, stranded or such.""  If my family were lost would I make the decisions that showed constant poor judgement, casual disregard for the ones I loved by putting them in harm's way every moment.  Would I ever make any agreement with an enemy that destroys life, violates life, steals hopes and dreams, eliminates individuality and despises other races as inferior in a way that shows ultimate bigotry?  Capt. Janeway does with the Borg, justifying what she does based on a telepathic contact between Kes and ONE single...yes ONE single alien of species 8472.

The Borg are presented as the greatest mass murderers in the Galaxy.  Perhaps accountable for Trillions of deaths, destruction of billions of families, theft of unimaginable unique celebration of art, literature and construct.  This series truly lost me, and I will never agree with the high praise others give this series.

Also, from the beginning of the series to the end... not one character 'wised' up.  Years upon years of 'exploring and adventuring' and still making rookie mistakes.  No-one learns any lessons in 7 years???  Wow.  Maybe Starfleet training and selection "" ain't what it once was "".

Finally in numerous episodes found in the series this Star Trek went beyond what the other Star Trek series did when pushing Science.  It tried to explain 'religious' aspects that humans (and other galactic species found in the series) with a very glorified scientific dogma approach.  The 'science-knows-all-explains-all-or-will-eventually' centrist approach.  No wonder this series is PRO Borg.

I do enjoy Sci-Fi but the messages sent by this series time and again truly 'lost' me.  Others obviously disagree which is fine because no-one need be part of 'The COLLECTIVE'.",1390176000,,1962,5.037267080745342

Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine the former Borg is heartwarming and frustrating at the same time. Chakotay is so sexy... :-)  The story plots are almost all solid and entertaining. Just the right combination of character personalities and interaction and not too much fighting and special effects.

A lot of action, comedy and morals in every episode.

Kate Mulgrew is, and always will be, a terrific Role Model for Girls who want to be  in space. Her believable mastery as Captain Janeway is something wonderful in all of television. She makes me just want to sit up straighter when she walks into the Bridge, and I am sitting at home, lounging in my pajamas! I love the progression of the Character of Seven of Nine, and her final Season is a masterful show of acting.

Was never really a fan of Kate Mulgrew but thought she did a great job as the only female captain in any version of Star Trek. Liked the whole premise of the series. Melding hostile crews thrown together out of necessity into a family by the time they made it back home. Even helped a Borg reclaim her humanity.",1384387200,,425,4.325

2161333,5,B00062IDCO,"Voyager is my favourite Star Trek series, so naturally I have been slowly building my collection.

These boxsets look nice, and the DVDs are relatively easy to get to.  The box itself is encased in a kind of dual plastic sleeve.  You remove the top part of the clear sleeve, and the lower part had the big graphic that covers the discs so it looks nice.  You can slide the box out from there, and it actually opens like a book which is nice.  Each disc has its own 'page' Each set is a differently coloured plastic, but the plastic itself might be seen as flimsy and might break easily.  If you take care of your things though, this shouldn't be a problem.  My outer plastic shell has gotten its share of scratches and dings from moving and normal usage, and I find it can sometimes be a bit frustrating to get the box back into it, due to the lip at the bottom it refuses to slide into.  (Much like getting that last card into a deck of cards) The back of the sleeve does show an episode list as well.

The menu is full on Star Trek, and has an animated intro, I was not disappointed.  The last disk also has a bunch of special features too!  It's overall a nice boxset, and I would recommend it to any Voyager fan!",1382486400,,1216,4.175965665236052
2161354,5,B00062IDCO,I love these old Star Trek programs. I started all the way back with season one. Just got caught up in the development of the characters and their relationships. Voyager is one of my favorite series of Gene Rodenberry's Star Trek.,1382140800,,230,4.634146341463414
2161355,5,B00062IDCO,I liked this series as one of the best of the Star Trek shows. I hadn't seen this year of shows since it was originally broadcast and really enjoyed seeing them again.,1382140800,,167,4.25
2161356,5,B00062IDCO,"The show was always a favorite of mine during its entire run. I think this season sparked a great human touch with 'Seven', and of course the doctor, coupled with an incredibly powerful female lead cast as Captain Janeway and you have television / DVD brilliance for sure!",1382054400,,272,4.6875
2161357,5,B00062IDCO,Voyager is definitely up there with TOS in my opinion and kicks the Lame Generation's butt. Janeway is a model of integrity and humanity. I loved watching this series and I already miss it.,1382054400,,189,4.588235294117647

2161359,1,B00062IDCO,"I'm a sucker for a good time travel episode, and this is one. Who wouldn't want to go back and do things differently. As we get older, we all ponder ""what if?"" However, consider this: in ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" ""The Voyage Home,"" and ""First Contact,"" history must be corrected to save the planet.

In ""Endgame,"" Janeway alters destiny because she didn't like that it took her 23 years to get home and tragedies befell some crew members whom she regarded as family. Captain Kirk let the woman he loved die to prevent Hitler from winning WW2!

Purists please correct me if I'm wrong, but there should have been some discussion/discovery about how the timeline was altered for the worse and old Janeway's actions were necessary to restore balance. Otherwise, it's one bitter and cranky old lady's desire to change history because she didn't like what happened. Given the Theory of Unintended Consequences, she could have set into motion a series of events that could have proven disastrous for the Federation. At the very least, she altered the destinies of trillions of lives across the United Federation of Planets, some perhaps for the better, others probably for the worse. Not the actions of a responsible Starfleet officer.

Of course, as Shatner would say, ""Get a life! It's just a TV show!""",1381795200,3,1302,4.829596412556054

I realize they had to have a character from that quadrant,( Kes was okay ), but his character was so nauseatingly ingratiating, I wouldn't have been surprised to see him lick peoples boots! When I saw MELD when Tuvok strangeled neelix I was so HAPPY, but then found out he was on the holodeck, dam!!!!! The show would have been better off without neelix, or at least maybe a different actor who wasn't so pushy, if I had been the captain and he'd turned my private dining room into a galley he'd have been off the ship in an eyeblink!!!!!!

You could tell she was more comfortable in the role, more relaxed.  The plots got a bit silly sometimes, however nothing like DS9.  I think Voyager reminded me more of the original series than any of the other Star Treks.  Couple that with Jeri Ryan in a body suit, what more could one ask for?",1376352000,,449,4.481481481481482

To see Tuvoc in the future being absent of logic was a little disturbing.  All in all, I would recommend this series to anyone that is a Trekie.

2161420,5,B00062IDCO,"One of the most interesting aspects of this series is its emphasis on isolation: the crew is lost a virtually unimaginable distance from home, obsessed (and reasonably so) with the simplest of goals: getting back. This pervasive undercurrent of aloneness, and the black-and-white stay-or-go mentality that the various characters grapple with, have made this series noteworthy for its exploration of the psychology of human existence within a microcosm of community amid a near-endless expanse of otherness.

I'm reviewing because I want to express how pleased I was with the way that this series wrapped up. It left no loose strings of any consequence, and the production team resolved long-running plot lines with aplomb. As the end drew nigh, the primary subplots completed their arcs in a satisfying, sensible way that left me feeling pleasantly satisfied that everyone was getting what they wanted--and deserved--in a believable, I-can-relate-to-the-characters'-motivations kind of way. When the final episode came (and then went), I was left with a genuine feeling of not just satisfactory, but downright satisfying, closure on the series as a whole.

A moment on some details. Not all the episodes ooze brilliance; in fact, some are tedious. Others are complex, elegant, engaging, and thought-provoking. I wish the series (and season 7) were more consistent in their quality--or at least the degree to which I found them engaging--but the vast majority of the episodes that Star Trek: Voyager comprises were at least entertaining, and at best masterful. On a scale that maxes out based on realism rather than idealism, the flaws in this show are too insignificant to keep me from giving it five stars overall.

Now a microdetail. Want a great sound bite? Check out season 7, episode 20 (""Friendship One""), at about the 12:32 mark: an ingenious expression of what the core of leadership really is.",1372204800,,1902,5.25

2161424,3,B00062IDCO,I enjoyed the last season but I didn't like the ending that much and some of the episodes just sort of seemed to have no purpose at all in the grand scheme of things all things considered.  I think though that the series was best in the first five seasons.,1370649600,,256,4.12

2161445,4,B00062IDCO,"Voyager, the third spin-off of the highly successful original Star Trek series from the late 1960s, holds its own with the previous spin-offs, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.  Due to its plotline, being lost in the Delta quadrant, it was able to venture into material the other series couldnt.  While they still used a lost Klingon or Ferengi, not to mention Q, they moved on to new cultures, creatures, and scientific advances.

That said, I found the writing to be superb insofar as plotlines, and character development.  One sore point was Capt. Janeway.  Theres no way in all of creation a ships captain makes so many bad decisions and comes out without a scratch.  The command decisions she made during the last year of the series were at best head scratching.  While I find the writing to be inventive and resourceful insofar as the new ideas presented, the ultra liberal bent of character Janeway, clearly shows why a liberal government or in this case a ships captain, is destructive to society as a whole.  I say this not to reflect on the actress Kate Mulgrew, she only played the part written for her.  Then again, it is a syfi/fantasy show so anything goes.

The acting becomes automatic, as in any TV show where the actor plays the part for any length of time.  There were standout parts, as in Robert Picardo as the holographic doctor, who was also a standout actor in the Stargate spin-off SG1.  I cant say enough good things about his acting.  Thanks to the writers for giving him a lot of air time.  Roxanne Dawson was superb as B'Elanna Torres, and Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) how did she keep such a stiff attitude for so many shows.  I think she was one of everyones favorites.

All in all a series worth watching, certainly as good as Next Generation, but maybe a bit shy of matching Deep Space Nine, but an excellent choice once you except the ultra liberal slant of the Janeway character.  You do grow to accept her as the captain; only one you wouldnt want to serve under.  In real life she would have killed her entire crew the first year.  She did manage to get them lost in the Delta quadrant.",1370217600,,2123,4.5394736842105265

2161465,5,B00062IDCO,"I really enjoyed the entire series, despite the minor technical issues that plagued series from episode to episode (I know geek alert, right?). Anyway, I found this season particularly intense. The crew faced many of their toughest personal challenges as well as the always fun alien of the week that tried to take over or destroy Voyager in some way.

The time travel episodes were mostly done well - even though I have my own issues with some of the lines that contradict technical facts presented in previous episodes of the series.

This is a solid 4 stars for the season as a whole. The fifth star is because of the final episode ""End Game"". I found this final installment to be so over the top that it brings the whole series up. It is easily one of the best series finales I have ever seen to date. Seeing how the crew handles themselves throughout the episode is very well done and the special effects were pretty stellar even by todays standards.

Contrary to many other Star Trek fans' views, I thought that there was great character development; I enjoyed that there was a lot more continuity from episode to episode throughout the entire series; great FX; and overall, great story lines.

2161548,2,B00062IDCO,"I find that most of the criticisms of Star Trek: Voyager I hear are not of what it does, but what it didn't do in its seven year run. 'The Void' presents all the problems squashed into 45 minutes.

Voyager gets sucked into (another) anomaly that is huge, empty, and inescapable. Several ships have been surviving in the void by pillaging other ships that get sucked in. It's dog eat dog, and it looks like the crew is going to have to make some tough choices if they want to get out of the void.

So, this is basically what happened to Voyager in the first episode, 'Caretaker'. They get pulled into new, rough territory. They have no back up, little resources, and a nearly impossible goal. This is a prime setup to challenge the ethics and expectations of a Starfleet ship in the Star Trek universe. Starfleet crews are always the good guys, holding true to the prime directive and performing the greater good for others. What happens though when that is all taken away though? What do you do when you're put into a situation where nobility has to bend and even break?

Same as usual apparently.

Janeway sticks with her Starfleet code. She'll only raid what was taken from her ship, she starts up negotiations with other ships to form an alliance, and her crew falls into place with her way of thinking. Everything just works out in the end.

On one side, it shows how enduring Janeway and Voyager are. On the other, it's boring as hell. Like the whole series itself, 'The Void' takes the less interesting course and it creates for some really frustrating television.",1352246400,2,1570,4.572953736654804
2161549,4,B00062IDCO,"Yes, the plot is quite familiar, but I found the relationship between Chakotay and Captain Janeway quite touching in this episode. I was wondering if there would ever be another reference to the time when they were really close due to their being stranded alone together on a planet. The little scene between past Janeway and  future Neelix is sweet as well. Tuvok gets to say his heartfelt tribute to the Captain in a death scene in a possible past. I do not grade Trek too hard on believe-ability, because, after all, it is science FICTION.  I love Voyager because of the characters and the creativity of many of the plots. After so many years of not being able to see the show, I am so glad to have them back, commercial free. They have become my TV family when I am alone. Special thanks to Kate Mulgrew for giving me a character I affectionately admire. I wish I could adopt Janeway as my sister :)
Best lines: Janeway :...You seem to get to know me quite well. Just how close do we get?""

2161550,3,B00062IDCO,"'Repentance' has heart, but is hampered by the some of the clichs Voyager is infested with.

Voyager picks up a group of condemned criminals and volunteers to help escort them after their original ship breaks down. Hauling some guys to their executions suck, but Janeway and crew don't want to break the Prime Directive with this species (Voyager has gotten to the point where they don't even bother to come up with names for all the new foreheads they meet). One of the more violent convicts, Iko, turns out to have the node in his brain broken, which is then fixed (nano-probes), and he becomes a murderer with a heart of gold.

Iko has become a new man, who understands what he has done was wrong and he never wants to do anything like it again. Yet, he still committed murder and the family wants him dead, even if he's no harm to anyone now. It's quite an ethical dilemma and it leads to some good scenes between Doc, Seven, and the Iko.

What is irritating though, is that it feels undercut by Voyager's clich shortcomings. Another alien species with hyper strict laws that the crew can butt heads with. Neelix getting suckered by an OK dude who might not be. The Doctor getting all up in peoples faces about ethics. The G.D. Prime Directive.

This episode has moments to like, but that's it.

Positive Points

- Jeff Kober as Iko. He has the acting skill of Ron Perlman and the presence of a WWE wrestler.

- Seven of Nine speaking out loud about her crimes and regrets from when she was full Borg. How does one carry the burden of ending thousands of lives?

Negative Points

- Hard to tell by the end what to actually think about the ethics brought up. Maybe that's the point, or the science behind Kober's rehabilitation never felt legit enough.",1350950400,,1755,4.511041009463723
2161551,4,B00062IDCO,"'Lineage' is one of (if not, the only) surprisingly great episodes of season seven. It drops all the space battles, anomalies, and technobabble for a rich story centered on B'elanna's anxieties about her daughter's future.

One of BLT's best character traits has been the fact that she perceives her Klingon heritage as a burden, instead of a source of strength. It's given her problems all her life, so much so that it clouds all the positives that have come from it. Those positives aren't enough though, as she tries to find a way through genetic manipulation to change her daughter's fate by extracting all the Klingon.

She fears that her new family will be in shambles as her daughter goes through the same problems she did growing up. She doesn't want to lose her new family. It's great to watch Dawson grapple with these scenes. McNeill is also great, trying to comfort her, while also fighting for his own daughter's right to her heritage. This all leads to a conclusion that feels earned and satisfying.

Positive Points

- Dawson and McNeill. 'Lineage' cements these two as one of Star Trek's best couples and an element Voyager got right.

- B'elanna's request to the Doctor for his role in her baby's life. Really sweet scene.

Negative Points

- It seems to be way too easy to re-write the Doctor's program. What happened to those safe guards Seven of Nine talked about implementing at the end of 'Equinox - Part II'?",1350950400,,1431,4.72289156626506
2161552,2,B00062IDCO,"A previous reviewer compared `Shattered' to a clip show and it's a dead on association. Voyager runs into its billionth anomaly (these things take up a massive amount of residential space in the Delta quadrant) and it fractures sections of the ship into different time periods in its history. It's up to Chakotay and Year One Janeway to put everything back together again.

By utilizing this ""shattered"" time structure, we get to see different moments from Voyager's seven-year journey. It comes across as an interactive clip show for Beltran and Mulgrew, as the former explains everything that is going to happen to the latter with living examples.

You would think this would be interesting, but it's just as boring as a regular clip show. If anything, `Shattered' makes things even more frustrating for the show as you get to see past events that never developed anywhere (the Maquis being the biggest). Also, you get a reset button at the end, so everything feels pointless by the time the credits role.

Positive Points

- Jeri Ryan in full Borg gear one last time. It looks uncomfortable as hell, but she looks fresh in it.

- Some of Janeway's rejoinders to future events seem to almost reflect fan reactions.

- The brief appearance of future Naomi and Icheb. Looking good kids.

Negative Points

'Flesh & Blood' felt like a conclusion (or perhaps, resolution) to the Doctor's long journey to relevance with everyone on Voyager. Sure, they came to accept him as one of the crew around season 3, but it never really felt written in stone. With the Doc presented with the choice of being with his own kind or staying loyal to his family (Voyager), the show puts all the cards on the table and really asks if Janeway has come to see the Doctor as a person.

This episode is worth the journey, as Janeway makes the situation clear with the Doctor about what he is and what he means to the crew. It's a really poignant moment for the show.

I'm focusing on this one aspect because 'Flesh & Blood' is rich with topics to talk about and analyze. One Amazon review wouldn't be able to cover it all.",1350432000,,908,4.490909090909091
2161554,3,B00062IDCO,"Ensign Harry Kim gets a lot of flack for being mostly useless after the 4th season of Voyager. When you add in the rumors of Garrett Wang's ensign originally being the one chosen to leave after the arrival of Seven of Nine (with the maybe-could-have-been-more-interesting Kes getting the boot instead), it's easy to give the guy a hard time.

I like to think of it like this. As a television character to watch, he's dead weight, but if the dude was real and I had a dope job on Federation starship, Harry would make a great roommate. He's a nice guy, who works hard, and can be down on his luck with the ladies. I know several guys like this and I call them my friends. This works in real life, but as a multidimensional character with an arc, Harry is just flat.

`Nightingale' gives Wang a chance this season to stretch Harry out and for the most part, I enjoyed it. Seeing Harry overextend himself and then man-up as a captain was a fine change of pace from taking pot shots from Tom. It's an interesting glance at what Harry could have been if Voyager had adopted serialized storytelling more openly.

When it comes down to it, if you like Harry, don't skip this episode. If not, then move along.

Positive Points

- If Harry ever did get his own command, having Seven of Nine as his first officer would be pretty boss. The friendship that has developed between them (since the initial awkwardness) I've grown to really like.

- Voyager planet-side and being overhauled. I just like seeing starships getting fixed. Shouldn't this happen more often with the amount of light-years its chalked up?

Negative Points

- More aliens who are nice, then turn out to be uncompromising jerks.

- The Nightingale's design could have been more interesting.",1350432000,,1749,4.616129032258065
2161555,3,B00062IDCO,"The primary reason to watch this episode is to take in Jeri Ryan's spot on recreation of Robert Picardo's EMH Doctor. Her facial expressions, vocal inflections, and mannerisms of the Doctor are almost too good. `Body and Soul' establishes the Doctor as an iconic Star Trek persona. When a character in a TV show can still be a joy to watch even when being acted by different actor, it shows just how well defined that character's personality and traits are.

Yet, my gripe with the episode is that it presents the Doctor as really selfish and dumb. That's somewhat of a, ""Well duh"" statement, but something about him abusing Seven's body for his own gain just came off as immoral to me. I kept thinking back to `Retrospect' and how angry Seven (and the Doctor) felt about her person being violated against her will. You would think the Doctor would be aware of Seven's history, but instead it's played for laughs.

Positive Points

- The Doctor telling Seven she needs to indulge more. What's the point of being human then? Come on girl, get crazy!

- That New York cheesecake looked delicious.

Negative Points

- The actual way in which the Doctor takes over Seven's body makes no sense. So you could put any holo-character into Seven and they would take over her body? Imagine the possibilities.",1350345600,,1298,4.6960352422907485
2161556,2,B00062IDCO,"`Inside Man' doesn't feel like an episode of Voyager. It comes across more as a lesser episode of `TNG', which is odd, because I find Reg Barclay episodes to be pretty good.

A hologram of Barclay (created by Barclay) is hijacked by some Ferengi, sent to Voyager, charms the pants off the crew, and presents them with a plan to get home that involves diving into stars. The Ferengi want Seven of Nine's probes, as they're worth mad profit. Barclay soon starts to realize something is up with his hologram, calls up Troi for help, and tries to figure out what's happening.

The Voyager crew is a non-factor throughout the episode. They're basically in it to swoon over Holo-Reg, as a kind of reversal of Reg's usual outgoing confidence when interacting with holograms, but with him now being the fake one. It's territory we've seen multiple times already, as it comes across as total retread.

The real plot is back in the Alpha quadrant, as Barclay, Troi, and Starfleet try to thwart the Ferengi from sending Voyager on a death flight. It's nice to see some of the classic gang and that's all it is - seeing some old buds. `Inside Man' could never have been made and we wouldn't have lost anything.

Positive Points

- Hanging around with Reg and Troi again is always nice. Also, seeing Richard McGonagle (of the `Uncharted' trilogy) is cool too.

Negative Points

- A regression from the strides Barclay took forward in the previous Voyager episode `Pathfinder.' So, all of the confidence and successes Reg got in that episode was dropped and we're back to this? Kind of weak.

- The way Voyager falls for Holo-Reg is pretty corny, but then this is Star Trek.",1350345600,,1660,4.660958904109589
2161572,4,B00062IDCO,"I feel that Star Trek is always at its best when it's commenting on our world, while performing in an alien one. Issues like racism, war, sex, and other critical topics that aren't easily approachable in shows set in modern times, Star Trek can get away with it. Most Star Trek fans know this and that's why we love it.

'Critical Care' fits into this tradition very well by looking at health care and the privileged versus the less fortunate. The Doctor is kidnapped and brought to a world where medical care is determined by a computer algorithm. Who ever is more useful to society, gets higher care, while those whom are basically below the poverty line get a band aid. The Doctor is furious and sets about doing whatever he can to get equal treatment for everyone.

This episode was made over a decade ago, but it feels more relevant then ever. Whichever side you fall on when it comes to medical care in a society, you'll find something to gnaw on.

Positive Points

- Robert Picardo. I've said in previous reviews that Voyager's cast is its greatest strength and this episode is no different. Picardo has a lot to work with here and he is great to watch. The scene in which he gets raw on the administrator is an interesting, dark moment for his character.

Negative Points

- The big eyed kid who just wants to live. It was a bit corny, but not a total deal breaker.",1350000000,,1373,4.450199203187251
2161573,2,B00062IDCO,"This episode hits two high peaks that cascade into deep valleys very quickly.

Someone on Voyager is putting Maquis crewmembers into comas and Tuvok is on the case. Problem for him though is, he's the one using mind melds to put them under. Turns out, a pissed off Maquis scientist implanted some kind of memory suggestion into Tuvok (back when he was undercover in the Alpha quadrant) and is only now activating it through mail sent from the Pathfinder project. Tuvok ""reawakens"" the Maquis crewmember's need to be...well Maquis.

It's awesome to see the Starfleet and Maquis crews fighting each other again, as that conflict was dropped after the first season. Yeah, the conflict is created through some rather bogus means, but seeing Chakotay and crew take over the ship presented the possibility that deep down, the Maquis still carry some animosity towards Starfleet. Seeing the ship taken over and Tuvok's struggle are the two highlights of this episode.

It's to bad though that none of it meant anything. Everything is quickly reversed and we go back to our normal, happy crew. Also, what is the point of a Maquis crew that is nowhere near the Demilitarized Zone? What about Starfleet's reaction to a group of rebels taking over Voyager? What did the Maquis scientist hope to achieve?

It's a great concept for an episode (this could have been a two-parter), but it falls way short of taking advantage of it.",1350000000,,1416,4.863070539419087
2161574,3,B00062IDCO,"Tom and B'Elanna's relationship has never been great from a story standpoint, but is has been a pleasant one, which is not a gripe. Things can be good and that is perfectly fine. T&B are cool characters who where brought together as lovers in a way I found sudden. Throwing them into the meat freezer of outer space and letting heavy emotions boil up from (as I thought) out of nowhere, just didn't seem earned.

Since then though, I've grown to like watching Dawson and McNeill bounce off each other. There is a sweet and sort of real nature to the way they argue and respect one another. `Drive' takes them to the next step by once again, getting them into a small space together and forcing heavy emotions to rise up. This time though, it doesn't feel like a sideswipe.

Positive Points

- Dawson and McNeill. Voyager's primary fault at times is its storytelling, but infrequently does it not give its acting talent room to stretch. BLT and Turkey Platter are fun to hang around with.

- Space Racing. Space races are cool.

Negative Points

- The sabotage sub-plot. This didn't hold water for me. Couldn't Tom just set the race aside to work on things with B'Elanna, then after patching up, hauled ass to the finish line in spectacular fashion? Would have been more interesting then more evil aliens and exploding warp cores.

- Relationship advice from Neelix when no one asked for it.",1349913600,,1390,4.626016260162602
2161575,5,B00062IDCO,"Primary Takeaway

Seven of Nine is Star Trek: Voyager's MVP, so I would say about 80% of the time when an episode comes along that features her, it will usually turn out to be a keeper. `Imperfection' is very much a great episode, as it puts Seven in the position of tackling aspects of her human side that she'd rather keep buried (this concept has worked before in episodes like `One' and `Infinite Regress').

The backbone of the episode is Seven confronting her own mortality. Her cortical node is burning out (a device in her skull that keeps her Borg implants in check with her fleshy side) and without a new one soon, she'll die. The episode is a highlight real of great moments as Seven deals with her ""imperfection,"" searches for any meaning to her brief life as an individual, and is reassured by members of the crew that she has impacted everyone on Voyager.

Fantastic episode. Don't skip it.

Positive Points

- Jeri Ryan. It's easy to hate on a girl in the skintight catsuit, but Ryan once again shows she is so much more then her character's shameless taste in wardrobe. Her scene with Dawson is powerful stuff.

- Manu Intiraymi as Icheb. The kid has chops and they finally show.

Negative Points

- Voyager as a shuttle vending machine. The Delta Flyer was destroyed in the last episode, but Voyager has an infinite supply of raw materials to make another one.

- More angry aliens who love space debris. They're most likely angry because they love space debris.",1349827200,,1479,4.614503816793893
2161576,5,B00062IDCO,"I would venture to say this is one of the most hard-hitting episodes in the entire series. Socioeconomic status and what sort of benefits it provides -- these things are all very much real in this day and age, not only within America but also between the developed world and the not-so-developed world -- and the alien ship presented in this episode, with its different levels of treatment, is a brilliant metaphor for how we in the upper echelon of society tend to view the world (because, let's face it, we're pretty lucky).

2161579,2,B00062IDCO,"It seems as though the only purpose for this episode was to recap and justify the absurdity that has followed on the 6 preceding seasons of Voyager. Well, that and to give several actors one last chance to resurrect their characters (e.g. Seska).

2161580,4,B00062IDCO,"I wish in the Voyager series Chakotay's character was more developed. He's supposed to be a foil to Janeway's character, but I think because of the feminist appeal to have a very authoritative female captain they made his character to be a soft-masculine support to her. I wish they would have given him a little bit more punch. I believe they made him Seven's romantic interest because he was really the only option and because he's in the possible position of ""father"" to the crew members to Janeway's obvious mothering. But he isn't a strong character, as in he's not willful. he always bends to Janeway and follows her no matter what. For the most part I had no problem with this, However, as a romantic interest for Seven, that kind of stable but passionless support did not make well for good chemistry in regards to a romantic relationship. It's sad though, they really could have pulled it if they just pumped up Chakotay's character more. Have Janeway as the captain, and then have Chakotay and Seven continuously being shoved together in different scenarios. The idea of them coming together in the first place is that they're both on the same level in regards to Janeway. Her closest and most responsive children. They're two characters who are brought closer to themselves because of the time they spend with the captain,the time they are forced to spend with her.

You can tell the show is written predominantly by men. In a lot of the relationships on the ship, the emotional dynamics are missing, especially here. They could have done so much. The chemistry could have been off the charts, but instead of having seven of nines relationships being natural they seemed made up and contrived. She just decided she liked Chakotay and viola! the last episode they end up getting together. The writers just decided to make her more human in the last season. Meanwhile they really could have been doing it the whole time. Easily could have had them both realizing how much they care for the other, making it deep and heartfelt. Something very human and very anti borg.

It also would have been fun to see Seven in the future. possibly hanging out with B'elenna's daughter. It's a bummer she was dead in this timeline. Seven and Torres were like sisters or should have been. Torres being the older one of course. It's Too bad they really could have richened up the character relationships, made them something worth watching.",1347494400,,2432,4.774346793349169

The 1st season was sent instead of the 5th season and they were great to work with in getting these two exchanged. Would highly recomend working with these folks.",1347494400,,318,4.229508196721311
2161592,4,B00062IDCO,"Throughout this season, I felt like the producers and writers of Star Trek Voyager just realized what the show needed. But, coming in the 7th season, it's too little, too late.

First, the characters. Tom Paris and B'elanna Torres finally get married. It's about time. Why did it take so long? Think of all the potential episodes with them as a married couple that the writers missed out on because this development only came in season 7.

Likewise, we finally see Seven of Nine grow. As much as I loved Seven in the previous seasons, her character was essentially in stasis. Two of my famous episodes, Imperfection and Human Error, show Seven really develop emotional bonds. We also see her fantasize and her internal frustration as she's prevented from reaching her goal to become more human. But again, this all comes far too late in the show, so we don't get to see the consequences of these changes until the very last episode.

The Doctor gets several great outings, including ""Author, Author"" and ""Critical Care"". These are also the episodes with the deepest moral point in the spirit of the best of Trek.

B'elanna gets a surprisingly strong episode with ""Lineage"". It was nice to see her struggle and come to grips with her past, including finally talking with her father. But again, I would love to have seen more of THIS B'elanna, but there's just not enough time.

Of all the crew, I feel only Captain Janeway, Neelix, Seven of Nine, and the Doctor get proper swansongs. By the season finale, I felt like I was only just beginning to warm up to some of the supporting characters.

Also, in terms of plot lines, season 7 really begins to realize the promise of having a ship stranded in the Delta Quadrant. The ""Void"" was a perfect argument for why the Voyager crew should stick to Starfleet's - and Star Trek's - ideals so far away from home. It should have come in season 1. We also get more interesting aliens and a greater sense of exploration. Again, too little, too late.

The finale, ""Endgame"", was a big letdown. It was partly a rip on TNG's ""All Good Things"", partly ""First Contact"" redux. While the episode gave us plenty of Borg and time travel, what we didn't get is a farewell to the Voyager crew. Kathryn Janeway takes up most of the screentime, with a bit of last minute characterization involving the Seven-Chakotay romance. We barely get any denouement at the end to welcome them back to the Alpha Quadrant.

With TNG, by season 7 I felt like we already knew the crew pretty well and the writers were getting tired (despite some great episodes like ""Pegasus""). With DS9's season 7, we got a satisfactory conclusion to the story arc and the characters' personal stories. But with Voyager, I feel like much of what we saw in season 7 really should have come much earlier in the season.",1347148800,,2811,4.6305220883534135

2161600,3,B00062IDCO,"As a series I give Voyager a 3.5 out of 5, I attribute that mostly to the outstanding 6th and 7th season. Season 1-5 was a mixed bag of quality some terrible and some amazing.

As for the finale I was hoping for actual character and story resolution...I was expecting too much I think

Here's what I got from the finale *spoilers*
1.) Janeway decides she is God and that she controls the outcome of everyone's lives to suit her selfish needs (AKA she wants 7 of 9 back BADDD!!)
2.) She decides to erase 26 years of history, 26 years of Tom and B'Elanna's daughter growing up, 26 years of EVERYONE'S LIFE
3.) She risks giving the Borg futuristic technology that could give them such an advantage they could DECIMATE EVERYTHING IN SECONDS
4.) the Borg wormhole opens up right in Earth's backyard.....1 of 6 gates....in the...entire...universe.....opens.....RIGHT....AT....EARTH!?
5.) Why didn't she just go back to before she destroyed the caretaker array? or better yet before she even went to find the Maquis ship? -- oh that's right because those 7 years in the Delta Quadrant; all those crewmen that died, were worth getting her favorite new friends like Neelix, 7 of 9, Kes, blah, blah, etc
6.) How did Admiral Janeway know about the Borg gate in the Nebula? When she arrived Voyager had already left it behind and had no idea what was there....I was joking at first but I think Janeway might actually be God, she knows EVERYTHING.
7) they finally get back home after 7 years and all they have to say *in monotone voices* is ""Oh we did it""

This is me being critical, but I should know by now Voyager is the Star Trek with the least continuity and care for logic. In a way that's what made it fun to watch; in fact, I really think Voyager is good Trek and good sci-fi. The characters are memorable and well written, and it had some of the best episodes of the whole ST franchise. It's just weird for me how it ended...I feel like it needed some lead-in to give the writers time to explore their life after returning to Earth and get some closure to the characters.

I mean edge of my seat intergalactic space battles spanning multiple races and sectors, story-lines were approaching their climax....I couldn't wait to see the finales.

I will definitely be enjoying this series from time to time for many years to come.

The show had many outstanding and memorable moments, and even some old favorite guests from ST:TNG such as Counselor Deanna Troi , and Lieutenant Reginald Barclay who is always a fun character to watch, and Q made an appearance even!

The episode where Neelix leaves his friends on Voyager behind to go and live with a group of Talaxians got me a little teary-eyed as well. LOL. And yes, the final two-parter episode could have been better, but I can let it slide because overall during the course of it's seven season run this show rocked!",1327449600,,968,4.494318181818182

I can't do that with any new show, that's for sure.  I love science fiction, and I loved Star Trek.  Voyager was always the most popular one, and needs to be the outline for future series of Star Trek considerations.  It has an organic quality, with impeccable acting.",1317859200,3,423,4.30379746835443
2161645,5,B00062IDCO,"I know I've said this for Seasons 5 and 6, but we sure focus on episodes around the Doctor and/or Seven this season.  Season 7 is kinda weird, in the fact that obviously being the last season, there are things that happen that really throw the crew off course, namely ""Workforce I and II"" and ""Drive"".  On the plus side for focusing so heavily on those two characters, it's nice to see that we really stretch out their characters, to see just how human a Hologram and a former Borg can be.  The best episodes this season include ""Unimatrix Zero II,"" ""Imperfection,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Repentance,"" ""The Void,"" ""Q2,"" ""Renaissance Man,"" and of course the Series Finale ""Endgame.""  To touch on some of this, ""Shattered"" is a great story, that takes us to various pasts and futures of Voyager, with Commander Chakotay being the only person able to safely traverse the ship.  ""The Void"" continues the story from ""Night"" in Season 5, but much darker.  Q returns with his son in ""Q2"" and Endgame is masterful piece of work. Sort of like ""All Good Things,"" in a way.",1317427200,8,1053,4.634408602150538
2161646,5,B00062IDCO,"So, some Hollywood writers really must of sat down and hammered some coffee for this one -- best finale ever. It helps to end a show when your audience still cares about the characters.

Still, I am deeply saddened that there is no Star Treck. First few seasons of BSG almost nursed me back to life but nothing comes close on TV today. 362 reality shows. 10 CSIs. Can't we have one Star Trek. Please! Ill buy somthing in every commercial they show for the whole season, I promise.",1316304000,2,480,4.393258426966292
2161647,5,B00062IDCO,"The rating is based on my personal feelings, and may not reflect stellar performances or impeccable writing. Still, as a stew of actors, writing, premise, and imagination, this was a brilliant series that was over, in my opinion, long before it's time.

It is a sad ending with what I felt was too short a finale. Personally, I was hoping for a season 8, 9, and 10, but then we might have been treated to a bunch of Stargate SG-1-esque final chapters. No thank you! (Shame on you Ben Browder and Claudia Black! You killed off Farscape, and then you had to kill SG1, too? Just kidding... or am I?)

Perhaps this would have been a good place to end the Voyager series. The creators were leading up to it in several previous episodes; the regular communication with Star Fleet, the loss of key characters, the lack of major threats on the road ahead. Yes, we could have seen a return of the Borg, the Hirogen, the Vidiians, the Kazon, any of the other recurring threats, or even a new threat with similar tactics.

The problem was that, like Harry said when asked why he was still such a low rank for a bridge officer, ""It's a small ship. There are only so many positions available."" I think this rang true with the characters, there was little more you could do with them that did not threaten to deviate from their most endearing qualities. Perhaps they went out when fans still thought of them as interesting, and not old folks stuffed into uniforms bursting at the seams, their knees rickety and their actions stiff.

Then again, I miss the characters and wish that some attempt at a collaboration would have ensued. A Star Trek movie doesn't always have to be based on a ship called Enterprise. I remember quite a few movies where the Enterprise was merely a footnote or a McGuffin for the chase.

I enjoyed the Voyager cast's performances and thought they executed their roles well. Still, this show had problems. For one thing, I thought the writers or directors had some sort of difficulty in dealing with the characters and popularity. Kes, and her actor, Jennifer Lien, should not have been let go just to bring on Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine. The problem was that the role both characters filled was the fish-out-of-water mentor-needing alien who would help to highlight Captain Janeway's wisdom and her human fallibility. What to do with Kes if Seven suddenly has all those lines? It's not like Kes was appearing in every episode. It seemed the show's creators were loathe to use her, but were contractually obligated to do so. They would haul her out to do make some obscure reference, ask a critical question, or give the other characters a much-needed nudge in the right direction, and then shove her back in the closet.

In the end of the franchise, however, it seemed that Star Trek had a case of ""boobie fever"". I think Jeri Ryan is an exceptional actor, and if her singing was real, vocalist as well. However, I don't think any of that got her a job. She had two great references up front, and one ""behind"" her. Star Trek: DS9 did the same thing, and it always seems to come when the writing becomes the weakest.

One last gripe from me was a true ""Where are they now?"" epilogue of events. Did the Maquis crew members find absolution on Earth? Did Seven of Nine run off, shave her hair, don an orange toga and become a Buddhist? Did Janeway take her new beau to a red carpet movie premier and make her old fiance jealous? Did Tuvok take up tennis, or the Doctor insight a holo-revolution?

THAT could have been the movie right THERE! The Doc meets up with his mining dopple-gangers and finds an eager audience, at first. But then, the holo-slaves (Note- Why didn't Janeway use Commander Data's battle for recognized sentience as a precedent in the Doctor's case?)decide to spread out and take out posts all over the Neutral Zone, go back in time, rob Tuvok of his Katra, which would be installed in Lt. Paris, B'ellana's babe, Kuvah'magh, could be left on a planet experiencing hyper-evolution and become an instant adult, go back to the M-class planet and become the emperor of the New Klingon Empire, Delta Quadrant Division. Janeway can get assimilated again, become Kathcutus of Borg, lead an assault of the Gamma Quadrant against the remnants of the Dominion and its Founders, and Captain Sisko can provide the McGuffin or Deus Ex Machina that will save the day. Moral of the story, don't give up the writing ghost. There's lots of stuff that can still be done, and it doesn't all have to be wiped out by that modern Star Trek reboot's time-screw debacle.

Star Trek: Voyager, we miss you. We hope you come back in some form, but if not, at least we have these episodes to keep us entertained.",1315699200,6,4712,4.593341260404281
2161648,5,B00062IDCO,"Note: I am a big Voyager fan so there will be that bias, but I am not only a Star Trek fan but one of its biggest critics.
  Endgame combines a lot of plot elements. Time travel, alternate time lines, and lots of Borg action. These elements are combined very skillfully, which sometimes doesn't happen in other episodes of Voyager or other Star Trek series. So this makes for a stunningly well done end to the series.
  As Endgame opens, we see scenes of the Voyager crew at home on Earth after their multi-decade journey. It's quite an emotional jolt for the Voyager viewer. And I won't spoil the plot, but key Voyager characters are deceased. Another Voyager crew member has a serious incurable mental heath disorder. But the older, grey, Janeway has an idea. Again  no spoilers here, but it's an idea that will make some changes. From there, things get wild and there will be things that will stick with you for a long time.

I ordered this season from Amazon and received it relatively quickly. However, the case this series comes in is absolutely terrible. The case is just a thin hard plastic, that is easily cracked (both my original order and replacement order came with a cracked case) and does nothing to protect the 7 DVDs. The case is also covered with a two piece plastic box and paper insert. This leaves the first disk in the case exposed. Case in point, when I unpackaged the set and removed the plastic box, I discovered the first disk in the case had a large scratch in it- and it was almost unplayable. I returned it without problems (kudos to Amazon!) and received a replacement within a week. As I stated earlier, this case was also cracked, however, the disks were undamaged, so I kept it.

2161665,4,B00062IDCO,"I own this season and I love it, but there are a few storylines I don't like. I had been waiting for a wedding ceremony for Tom and B'Elanna from the start. I was cheated out of seeing them get married in a ceremony. No, ""Course Oblivion"" doesn't count because it wasn't the real Tom and B'Elanna. I didn't like some of the aspects of the ""Endgame"". At the reunion it seemed as if ""Harry"" and the ""Doctor"" wrote it. It was all from their fantasies. C'mon now, no flesh and blood woman ia going to marry a hologram. Tom who did the most to get them home was portrayed as a clown. The writers should have shown him some respect. He was Chief Pilot, Chief Medic,
He designed the Delta flyer, He put his life in danger in so many instances to save the crew. From the beginning when he saved Chakotay's life by getting him off that rickety staircase just before it dropped into an endless pit. He went undercover with the Kazon, He got the ship back after it was taken by the Kazon and saved the crew from having to spend the rest of their lives on that baren volcanic planet by flying through weapons fire. He broke the warp barrier. He trained with the Doctor even though he hated it for the sake of the crew. As far as I'm concerned Tom Paris was Voyager's hero. What did Harry do to compare? Nothing. Harry was Captain Janeway's pet from the beginning. She gave him priveleges
he didn't earn. She started training Harry to take her place as Captain even though he wasn't captain material. In ""Nightingale"" he got involved with aliens and snuck them back to Voyager without asking the real Captain's permission. Harry involved himself and the crew in a conflict between warring species, he risked bringing Voyager into that war. He risked wiping out the crew with an alien disease because of his hormones  in ""The Disease"" and all he got was a slap on the wrist. He wasn't punished in any way because he was the Captain's pet. On the other hand Tom who was trying to saved a ""planet"" from destruction was too severely punished. It should have been one or the other, either demoted or brig, not both.
For risking wiping out the crew Harry diserved both, but got neither. I believe Seven had more to do with designing Astrometrics than Harry. C'Mon, Seven had technologies from who knows how many different alien worlds. Tom is the one who should have been shown in a great light in ""Endgame"", not Harry. At the end I would have liked to have seen the Paris family: Tom, B'Elanna, and baby together, not B'Elanna, baby, and the Doctor. Oh, and speaking of the baby, who in their right mind is going to make a hologram a godfather to a flesh and blood baby. B'Elanna only did that because she felt guilty for reprogramming him. She refused men godfathership because she claimed they weren't qualified, but the Doctor wasn't any more qualified. I only hope they changed that once they got back. Oh, and by the way. I have a theory of what that waterworld planet was. I think it was meant to house that creature. I think it was like a huge aquarium. That creature might of meant a lot to the species who built it and wanted to give it a proper home.",1290211200,,3142,4.407917383820998

A few months later, Spike's three episodes per day schedule had reached season seven. I first knew that season seven was going to be good after ""Imperfection,"" which was the SECOND episode of the season. Actually, first if you don't count Unimatrix Zero Pt 2. That feeling of greatness returned the next day when I watched Drive. That episode told me, ""This will be the greatest season so far."" I was right.

See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a fair market price of $25-35. So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range. So, $60 is your sweet spot.

2161736,2,B00062IDCO,"I generally consider myself a Star Trek fan, but I've never gotten into Voyager, only watching the occasional episode here and there.  Thanks to a friend, I got the opportunity to catch season 7, but the result was yet another round of missed opportunities for the Trek series that boasted such an enticing premise.  Compared to the seventh seasons of TNG (4.5/5) and DS9 (4/5), this is definitely lagging quite a few steps behind.  That said, few of the episodes were outright terrible, as most were just mediocre, and there were a number of fairly enjoyable episodes as well.

If Voyager is ultimately a TNG clone with a few minor twists, it comes up far short of its predecessor thanks to its mediocre cast and bland storytelling.  DS9 and Enterprise weren't perfect, but at least they delivered lengthy, epic story arcs that gave us tension, intrigue, moral quandaries, and cool space battles.

Unimatrix Zero, Part II- C, not without some cool action and f/x, but ultimately drags too much when focusing on 7 of 9 and her romance.

Imperfection- D, not being a Seven fan, I can't say I found this episode to be very entertaining.

Drive- B-, not that bad, given that Paris and Torres make for a decent couple.  The race had its moments of humor.

Repression- C+, starts out intriguing, but loses its momentum towards the end.

Critical Care- C-, a subpar episode focusing on the holographic doctor.

Nightingale- B-, pretty interesting to see Harry Kim take command, even if the episode doesn't really do anything outstanding.

Flesh and Blood- B-, delivers some good tension and excitement, though it suffers a bit when focusing on the Doctor and his interaction with the other holograms.

Shattered- B, probably the season's best episode, even if the premise comes across a bit gimmicky.  It's cool to see how Janeway and Chakotay interact given the situation.

Lineage- C, Torres' back story makes for some rather weak drama.
Repentance- D, had the potential for strong drama, but comes across too bland and predictable.

Prophecy- B, a rather amusing episode thanks to the presence of an entire crew of Klingons.  There's some solid laughs and a bit of action towards the end.

The Void- B, this episode does a pretty convincing job of creating a dire situation, though I think it would have been more dramatically effective if Janeway had violated the prime directive in this instance.

Workforce- C-, rips off an already mediocre Stargate SG-1 episode.

Q2- C-, not without its share of laughs thanks to the presence of Q, but his son is unbearably annoying and badly acted.

Author, Author- B, an absolutely hilarious first half thanks to the Doctor's supremely silly holodeck novel gives way to a limp courtroom drama that was done better in TNG's The Measure of a Man.

Friendship One- C+

Natural Law- D

Renaissance Man- C-, loved the Doctor's ""deathbed"" confession, but little else about this episode works.

Endgame- C, the time travel premise seems like a cheap cop-out (and all the more frustrating when you recall the point the crew had made about not changing time back in Season 1's Eye of the Needle). There's some cool action against the Borg, but not enough to really send this series out with a bang.",1144800000,10,3227,4.843065693430657

2161738,5,B00062IDCO,"Voyager got of to a shaky start, but the seventh and final season bubbles over with the magic that makes Star Trek the phenomena that it is. The series finally, ""End Game I & II"" is, for me, the best Star Trek story ever. Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) breaks stereotypes by being a powerful female leader who does not sacrifice her femininity in the process. She can be as diplomatic as Picard or as ruthless as Kirk without missing a beat. Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) discovers her humanity and proves again that women can be both beautiful and powerful. The Doctor (Robert Picardo, a truly gifted actor), who's character is a hologram, adds both comic relief and expands the definition of life itself. Testing the limits of the human potential is what makes Star Trek great and this season of Voyager shows us just how powerful, alluring, and compassionate humanity can be.",1136073600,58,874,4.718954248366013

They even managed to misuse one of the most interesting recent character creations, The Borg Queen.

2161751,4,B00062IDCO,"Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...

Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...

The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 7) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Unimatrix Zero"" in which Seven Of Nine discovers a place known as Unimatrix Zero, where Borg drones become individuals for a short period during their regeneration. However, once the regeneration process is complete, the drones forget all memory of the event. Capt. Janeway views this revelation as an opportunity to attack the Borg, and the Voyager must execute the plan perfectly if it is to succeed... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Nightingale"" in which Harry Kim, Seven Of Nine, and Neelix stumble across a war between two alien nations while scavenging for dilithium, and ""Friendship One"" in which, having established regular contact with Alpha Quadrant, the Voyager receives orders from Starfleet to hunt down the lost 21st Century Earth probe, Friendship One...

2161752,3,B00062IDCO,"The episodes and other details have been covered elsewhere. I would just like to point out a few things:

I'm a huge fan of this series and the previous ones with the exception of DS9, which is plain boring. I love ST Voyager, the first 4 seasons were fantastic, but... enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of the producers' political correctness and pedantry. How many times do we need to hear about ""humanity"", ""individuality"", ""holo-rights"" etc etc etc? These issues have been explored extensively both in the first 4-5 seasons of the series and in Star Trek:The Next Generation. Even in the 6th season, Janeway sacrificed the crew's privileges and their opportunity to communicate with their loved-ones at home just to let the Doctor with the inferiority complex to prove himself worthy of his ""holo-humanity"" once again.

Also, Janeway's exaggerated ""compassion"" would probably make Jesus to freak out.

They also made the mistake of over-showing the Borg. One of the reasons why the Borg were so succesful is because they were kept in the dark, full of evil power and mystery. Now, the Borg have become more common than humanity itself. The Borg Queen has lost her fatal and dark power. She's just another petty alien, trying to survive. Alas, Janeway won't let her. In this respect, Janeway's arrogance is unprecedented! Alice Krige was great (and so was Kate Mulgrew), but that is not enough to save the day.

What happened? Did the producers get bored with their own creation? Because that's what it feels like. Knowing when to begin and when to stop is wisdom.

All good things... in moderation, please. And remember, we still love Star Trek.",1121299200,10,1652,4.885714285714286
2161753,4,B00062IDCO,"The first thing you see when you get this box set is how bad the box is especially compared with the packaging for the original series.  If you only have enough money to get one season of voyager you would probably want to get season 3 instead.  It has the most supporters and you can argue the most original ideas.  The highlights of this season include the last episode called ""endgame"" because there are some good simulated space battles, ""author, author"" because it was more humorus and went back to the roots of making episodes haphazardly and at the whim of writers, ""flesh and blood"" also because there was a decent amount of fighting and combat, ""the void"" which seemed interesting because the captin although portrayed as trying to be the enlightned person who rises above the masses comes off more as a lunitic who has gone mad with power, and also barely making the list ""imperfection"" because the security chiefs acting is rather interesting in this episode.  Most of the rest of the episodes don't cut it because instead of focusing on entertaining the audience or telling some kind of story they try to tell some kind of moral that everyone understands anyway.",1118534400,,1174,4.740196078431373

The last two epiosdes are good but there is just like an abrupt end to the struggle to get home. Janeway travels back in time to try to change things that caused the journey to take 23 years to complete..we have been through seven and then the show ends. It would have made more sense to re-install the tran warp drive thing and encounter the borg along the way and somehow destroy their trans warp network somehow in another fashion or if species 8472 would have come back wanting to destroy the Borg completely it would have made more sense. Otherwise, the season is better than season six was in my opinion.",1111708800,3,725,4.417910447761194
2161757,1,B00062IDCO,"While the first half of Season Seven had some great episodes there was a downward spiral that started mid-season.  Too much focus was on Seven and the Doctor which is disappointing to those of us who also like the other characters.

The finale was a major letdown.  Borg?  Been done before ad nauseum in other episodes.  Time travel?  Again, ""Timeless"", ""Future's End"" and ""Year of Hell"" did it better. The Chakotay/Seven ""relationship""? What were they thinking? The only saving grace to the finale was Mulgrew's performance as both the older and younger Janeway.

While I purchased all six of the other seasons I'm letting this one go.  I may pick it up used down the line just to complete the collection but there's no hurry.",1107820800,9,727,4.76

2161759,5,B00062IDCO,"This is it.  The final season of Star Trek: Voyager.  With Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and The Next Generation, the later seasons suffered a little bit in the writing areas due to the writers moving to a new show.  Voyager did not have this problem since ""Enterprise"" didn't premiere until the fall AFTER Voyager ended.  The Seventh season employs some of the best writing and storytelling of the entire series.  The finale is a great episode, but not perfect.  There are two multi-part stories in this season that are absolutely superb.  Voyager couldn't go out without bringing back the saboteur Seska for a final hurrah.  Dwight Schultz reprises his role as Barclay again, and Marina Sirtis makes an appearance.  The Doctor makes a controvertial holonovel.  Harry Kim takes his first command and Q returns again.  Another great season.  Highly recommend it to Star Trek fans and others alike.

2161760,5,B00062IDCO,"If you're considering buying Season 7 of Voyager you're most likely a fan of the show, so I won't bore you with my opinions of the various episodes except to say that the overwhelming majority were well written with excellent performances by the cast. Speaking of the performances, I really appreciated the extra feautures (especially the commentary of Robert Picardo) as they give fans a brief inside look at the actors and their feelings about their performances and the show itself. The other features about various creation and production aspects of the show were also worth watching.

Season 7 is my first DVD set from Voyager (I'm collecting DS9 and have the first three years). I skipped to season 7 of Voyager as I was overseas during its airing and missed many episodes. It was great to see some 'new' episodes. I enjoyed Voyager 7 so much that I'm putting my DS9 collection on hold am now working backwards on Voyager...next up Season 6.",1106524800,25,947,4.774390243902439

2161789,5,B00062IDCO,"If not just to complete your set, the Seventh Season of STAR TREK: VOYAGER stands alone as the only one of the series to have really brough the villainy of the Borg to the fore front.  Undeniably the Bord are among the greatest adversaries in the Trek Universe and once pitted against the likes of Starfleet legend Captain Kathyrn Janeay and her crew, you can expect the final season to deliver all the way till ""Endgame"".",1103587200,5,422,4.552631578947368
2161790,4,B00062IDCO,"Many television series don't last for a single season, some may only last one or two years, but some may become highly successful and have as many as seven seasons.  However, as is quite often the case, a series' seventh season is typically its final season giving its actors one last curtain call to rap up loose ends and say farewell to their loyal audience.  Such was the case for the highly successful television series ""Star Trek Voyager"", which aired between 1995 and 2001.  Based upon the original ""Star Trek"" universe concept created by the legendary Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's, ""Star Trek Voyager"" was the fourth television series to take its audience ""where no man had gone before"", and began only one year after the highly successful second ""Star Trek"" series, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", closed with its seventh season. For its efforts, a total of 172 episodes of ""Star Trek Voyager"" were filmed and aired, with all but the first season having 26 episodes.  The initial first season only had 16 episodes, but was a good start for what ultimately became a fine sci-fi television series thanks to the efforts of Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor.

What made ""Star Trek Voyager"" unique from its three predecessors was its placement within the ""Star Trek"" universe.  The previous three series took place primarily in what is referred to as the Alpha Quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Contained within the Alpha Quadrant are the familiar United Federation of Planets guarded by Starfleet, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire, the Cardassians and several other alien races very familiar to ""Star Trek"" aficionados.  Excursions were made into the Beta and Gamma Quadrants (especially in ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9"" and its wormhole that lead deep into the Gamma Quadrant), but very little was known about the very distant Delta Quadrant, except for the species known as the Borg that were introduced to Starfleet in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" thanks to the shenanigans of the interfering & powerful alien known simply as Q (John de Lancie).

""Star Trek Voyager"", then, became the vehicle by which the unknown Delta Quadrant at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy could become known and defined within the ""Star Trek"" universe, but not due to human means.  Instead, a very powerful alien (not Q) during the first episode of ""Star Trek Voyager"" pulled the starship, a Maqi ship and their respective crews deep into the Delta Quadrant.  Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take a ship several decades to traverse the vast distance to return to Earth. Hence, the seven-year series focused on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew (combined with the Maqi crew), who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of going. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.

The primary cast members of the seventh season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Ensign Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's seventh season begins with the episode ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 2"".  In this continuation of the sixth-season cliffhanger final episode, the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) decides to destroy the subversive Unimatrix Zero once and for all, but Captain Janeway sees it as an opportunity to infiltrate the Borg collective by way of a virus.  When the Borg Queen finds a cube with three infected drones, she destroys it.  To protect the drones that can visit Unimatrix Zero from being discovered and destroyed, Captain Janeway & Seven of Nine decide to destroy it.

During the seventh season of ""Voyager"", Seven of Nine faces death in episode ""Imperfection"", the Doctor is kidnapped in episode ""Critical Care"", Lt. Barclay (Dwight Schultz) visits Voyager as a hologram in episode ""Inside Man"", B'Elanna discovers shes pregnant in episode ""Lineage"", Q visits Voyager again in episode ""Q2"", Neelix leaves Voyager in episode ""Homestead"" and Admiral Catherine Janeway from the future visits to help voyager home in the two part series final ""Endgame"". The best seventh-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 2"", ""Imperfection"", ""Critical Care"", ""Inside Man"", ""Body and Soul"", ""Lineage"", ""Repentance"", ""Prophecy"", ""The Void"", ""Human Error"", ""Q2"", ""Author, Author"", ""Friendship One"", ""Natural Law"", ""Renaissance Man"", ""Endgame, Part 1"" and series final ""Endgame, Part 2"".  The least memorable seventh-season episodes include ""Flesh and Blood, Parts 1 & 2"", ""Shattered"", ""Workforce, Parts 1 & 2"" and ""Homestead"".

Overall, I rate the seventh season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was on par with the sixth season for the most part, but ended on a high-note with the series final.  Well done to the actors, writers, producers and crew that brought ""Star Trek Voyager"" to life for seven wonderful years.",1101859200,5,5402,5.166093928980527
2161791,3,B00062IDCO,"While the last season was not great, it was an improvement, though the Chakotay/Seven of Nine love story was lame and really came from no where. Here was another stumbling block of the series. One has to wonder just how big Hirogen space is, because they bump into the again in the two-part Flesh and Blood (as the consequences of Janeway giving them the holodeck technology bites her in the ass). Like the Malon, who a made several appearances in the fifth season and were told their space is small (yet late in the season by the time Juggernaut aired, Voyager has jumped ten years closer to the Alpha Quadrant after the events of Dark Frontier), the return of the Hirogens is a head scratchier. True, we are told early on that the Hirogen have no real homeworld and they travel the comos, spread out like dandelions, but the odds of running into them -10,000 light years closer to Earth -was not realistic. I mean there was no way they could've run into the same Hirogen they gave the holodeck technology to in the first place. It just seemed they had this concept -Hologram Rights - so they hoped no one paid attention.  And while Shattered was a clip show, with out the actual clips unlike Relativity, it was another example of how desperate the show had become. As the series began to wind down, it began to tie up loose ends, as all but one of the Borgs kids were finally shuffled off. And while a Q episode is always worth waiting for, Q2 was a sorry story, as it looked like John de Lancie was tired of playing the role. And only God knows how he was able to get his own real life son, Keegan to play Q's son. But as the stories dried up, the show reverted back to predictable episodes. As an example, while it nice to finally get rid of the ever-annoying Neelix, his send off Homestead was very hackneyed. And then there was the Doctor's directionless holonovel thing. Desperation can breed bad stories, and Voyager seems to swim in its ocean. And while I had given up on the show way back in season 2, I had some dark hope the show would find its feet, but. Alas, it was not going to happen. The series ended with a remake of a previous episode, but is also probably Mulgrew's finest performance, at least as the silver-haired Admiral. Endgame opened 10 years after the crew of Voyager returned after spending 23 years in the Delta Quadrant. But all was not rosy, and an older, more cynical Admiral Janeway has decided to alter the outcome of what has happened. Like Timeless from the series fifth season, Janeway (like Harry was), is filled with regret at what has happened to her crew, especially Seven of Nine and Chakotay, who appeared to have died returning home. So she decides to change the rules and her future. Very politically incorrect and very ""cowboy diplomacy"" like. When all is said and done Endgame was a fine finale, if once again, unoriginal. There were some nice touches in this show, including Alice Krige's return as the Borg Queen and Kate Mulgrew's finest appearance as the older, bitter Janeway. Had she played Janeway like this through 7 seasons, I think the show could have been better. And while the ending was abrupt, it was in keeping with Trek's entire problem of rushing all its endings. Looking at the series as a whole, Michael Piller was able to see both its strengths and weaknesses. ""The whole idea of exploring space is a metaphor for exploring ourselves,"" he said. ""When Voyager did that, I think it did very well. I think the Seven of Nine stories gave us some insight into humanity and the meaning of humanity that the series sorely wanted. It had its moments. But when it did the exploding spaceships and space-monsters and so forth, the problem is that that's what everybody does in science fiction. I think that reduces Star Trek to being no better and worse than other science fiction shows."" Piller told Cinefantastique's Anna L. Kaplan (via TrekWeb). ""I have always encouraged the writers to try to find the human elements, the moral and ethical dilemmas,"" he said. ""I think there was less an appetite for that after I left."" Ultimately, Voyager lacked a distinctive voice; a style to call it's own. TOS featured a likable cast and featured parables. TNG went a step further with their stories, and made the crew more human, as character development and story arc's made the show more realistic. DS9 took a little of TNG's soap opera elements and took it in another direction, featuring a near series long arc that told the viewers nothing was as it seemed. Voyager attempted to take all those elements from the three previous series -and it worked only on occasion- but nothing else was added to the mix. There was no growth and change as the series aged because it had its Temporal Reset Button pushed week after week. And because of that, the show became fated to be a somewhat entertaining Star Trek series, but at the end of the day, offered nothing in the way of the next step in this franchise's evolutionary life.",1100908800,19,4977,4.579596412556054

Never have I enjoyed a series more, and the last season while peppered with some rather slow stories, ended the way I had always imagagined. Voyagers actors and techincal staff (writers, producers, directors, editors) should be commended for the level of stories that were told throughout it's lifespan. The final season came way to early in my opinion and I think that Paromount is sadly mistaken in it's choice to not use the characters in a motion picture. Give Voyager a chance and revel in it's creative and supremely implemented stories. Go Kathy!",1098316800,24,1010,4.406417112299465
2161796,5,B00062IDCO,"Here we are, it is May 2001--September 11th is 4 months away.  The America that I grew up with faced an uncertain future as we were not sure where we were heading with this new president who came to office under none of the best circumstances.  The dot-com bubble was bursting and people who made money off of it were realizing that this was just all paper to begin with.  This is the backdrop of the end of ""Star Trek:  Voyager"" as a TV series.  This was the first of the ""Star Trek"" series where I saw it from beginning to end as it was aired.  This was the season where they were going to tie loose ends up.

Communications between Starfleet and Voyager strengthened as Barclay found a way to contact Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.  We would find Neelix leaving to stay with a colony of Telaxians in an asteroid field where he would stay with the woman of his dreams and then become the Federation Ambassador to the Delta Quadrant.

As usual, the season began with a cliffhanger as Janeway and crew find themselves needing to outwit the Borg.  It even required Janeway, Tuvok and Torres to become assimilated in order to do it.  Speaking of Borg, 7 of 9 and Chakotay discovery they have feelings for each other and that might pose problems at the final episode.

The importance of heading home weighs most heavily on Tuvok, when he discovers he has a disease that can only be cured by brain tissue from a member of his family--which would be very simple if they were in the Alpha Quadrant, but not so simple in the Delta Quadrant.

Of course, there is later in the season a pregnant Torres, who winds up giving birth to hers and Paris' first child in the final episode, as Voyager manages her way out of a Borg Ship sent by the Queen to stop Janeway from taking a transwarp conduit home.

At the end, it was great that they ended the series the way that they did--they finally made it home inside a Borg Ship that they wind up destroying from the inside at Wolf-359 in front of a Federation fleet not sure what they would encounter.  ""Endgame"" also displayed Janeway's continuing obsession with finding a way home and that even after she got there, she was finding a way to get her crew home faster in another timeline.

What happened to the crew after they arrived?  We know about Janeway--for some reason, Starfleet promoted her to Admiral, where we would see her reprise her role in ""Star Trek:  Nemesis"".  She should have faced a court martial and/or a board of inquiry first for getting that ship and that crew lost in the badlands 7 years earlier.  Whereas""DS9"" seemed sentimental and sappy in its final episode, we find ""Voyager"" triumphant--destroying the Borg (...or did they?) and getting home in 7 years as opposed to the original 16.",1097366400,11,2748,4.502016129032258

8036955,2,B00062IDCO,"Really thought this series started off well, but by this final season the luster seems to be gone. There really wasn't much of a huge buildup to the final episode, and when we finally got to the last episode, what a massive disappointment it turned out to be. You can't build a series for seven years and establish so much character history and then just wrap it all up with essentially what felt like a rip-off of the end of Next Generation, with an older captain jumping around in time. We've seen it with Picard, and this just felt like a rehash of that theme. And what the heck happens to all of these characters? Does Tuvok see his wife again? Does the Doctor go on to Starfleet medical to share his experience as a liberated hologram? What about the Maquis characters? Did they face a trial or anything? It was infuriating how NONE of these characters and plots were satisfactorily resolved, and instead all we got was a hurried Borg encounter and yet another temporal anomaly. Great series, started well, but really came to a lousy and poorly-resolved conclusion.",1523145600,,1070,4.636842105263158
8036956,4,B00062IDCO,"interesting explorations of fictional science throughout all seven seasons of ""Star Trek: Voyager""  Numerous references to neurogenic pathogens ""against the Borg"" contradicted the use of medifraud encouraged All Co Hell and Marriage You Wanna by the Borg-like bipedal hominoids plaguing American society.  The notion of an Emergency Medical Hologram honoring the Hippocratic Oath to ""do no harm"" was the most far-fetched aspect of the fictions contradicting what real medifrauds are doing to ""wrongfully kill"" more than 250,000 Americans per year and to torture and maim an unreported plethora of others.
