Stay far far far far away from this movie. Acting, and dialogue was the worst part about this movie. Just plain weird and annoying dialogue. The characters were horrible in everyway. Like I said please do not watch this......DO NOT WATCH THIS AT ALL........If you do then good its your fault...That is all.",1359849600,2,446,4.385542168674699

5412175,4,B00AEJM61I,"I do not think this movie deserves all of the bad reviews it has gotten overall. The actors and dialogue could have been better, but for a first film for Michael Gallagher, it was great. The twist-ending is the best part, I did not expect it at all. All considered, I loved the movie. It could be better, but what movie couldn't?",1359417600,3,329,4.32258064516129
5412176,3,B00AEJM61I,"This movie was a nice surprise. I was hesitant to rent it because there was no trailer and nothing about it on YouTube either. But we went for it and it was worth it. If you are in to the Internet and don't mind some geek humor and references you'll like it even more. You won't know who the killer is until the end and there is a nice twist. Very little blood and guts and no nudity or sex so don't look here for that. Otherwise, enjoy a cool little horror flick.",1358899200,5,464,4.0
5412177,3,B00AEJM61I,"I wish I could give this movie five stars. I really do. I love the idea of a manifestation of human evil, coming alive through one of our greatest tools. I love the examination of ""trolling"" behavior and how it looks when people take that attitude into the real world. I love the idea of the extremes we can go through when we have the advantage of anonymity. And I love the idea of humanity being just a step in the evolution of something truly terrifying.

That being said though, the movie itself is a mess. Most of the actors are good, but the script is a jumbled mess. The dialogue is so overly-dramatic and jarring. It sounds to me like the writers spent a lot of time researching the inner-working of internet communities and personalities in a textbook, but never actually bothered to go online.

I enjoyed the reveal towards the end and thought it made for a very good ending, but the actual last couple of minutes were a little disappointing and predictable.

I think the filmmakers have some great ideas, but could really use some more time at the drawing board, trying to figure out the execution.

I give it three stars for the effort, because I am very impressed with the idea behind it, but I'm willing to admit that it's a generous rating, considering how the whole thing actually panned out.",1358640000,41,1308,4.529661016949152
5412207,2,B00AEJM61I,"I just liked it because Shane Dawson was in it, to be honest. The acting is pretty terrible, the ending is like wtf??. And the movie quality is truly poor. I like the whole idea of Smiley, but the production didn't meet my expectations. If you like fake horror that leaves you laughing I recommend, if you are a horror fanatic like me, who expects quality- I wouldn't recommend it. But if you feel like watching a movie before you sleep that wouldn't give you nightmares- I advise it to be a good way to waste your time.",1474675200,,520,4.316326530612245

5412214,4,B00AEJM61I,"Ashleys (Caitlin Gerard) mom has died; she suffers from PTSD.  A new student in college, she quickly falls into a group of strange students consisting of computer nerds who are heavily into prowling anonymous chat rooms.  There is an urban legend that if you type, I did it for the lolz, three times, the person with whom you are chatting will be brutally murdered by a creature known as Smiley.  A skeptic, Ashley does this to a complete stranger; she immediately witnesses their gruesome murder.  Traumatized, Ashley tells her teacher, psychiatrist and, eventually, the police, but no one believes in the existence of Smiley.  Smiley begins stalking her and killing everyone around her.  There are a few creative killings to maintain a fast pacing.

  Smiley bares similarities to classic horror films such as Candy Man.  The poster art suggests that it is on the same caliber as the Scream, I Know What You Did, and Urban Legend franchises but poor acting prevents this from happening.  It does have a twisted ending that makes viewers reflect on the general evilness of society.  Smiley can be streamed from Amazon Video and has an excellent widescreen, HD presentation with good audio and SDH captions.  It is recommended for college students who are fans of slasher flicks.  Though it will never be ranked among the modern horror classics, Smiley has a couple of twists at the end that make it worth watching, especially when it is late on a Saturday night and no one has invited you to their keg party.",1470960000,2,1509,4.821011673151751

5412232,1,B00AEJM61I,"This movie is as sad as our current social media dependent society is.  It's like rebooting Candyman for the current youth to enjoy, but the whole vibe of the movie is just as complacent as kids glued to their phones. The main girl character in the this was obviously written by someone who does not understand or know anything about depression or panic attacks, as her reasoning and decisions didn't make sense neither did the counselor's. The ending seemed rather rushed and was at least half expected.",1468713600,,504,4.793103448275862

5412245,2,B00AEJM61I,"Although the cameos were entertaining, don't waste your time on this movie. It was pretty stupid throughout the whole movie, and the ending was just confusing and dumb. They tried to have a spooky, twist ending, but it really didn't work and just was a disappointment. The main character was too whiny and had one too many mental breakdowns, and her mediocre ""dorm buddy"" was just an awful actress. I did like the relationship between the main character and the nerd guy, but that wasn't enough to save this awful movie. The jump scares weren't half bad, but, once again, it didn't save the movie from being awful. I also think the main character's father and teacher came off as creepy and just not enjoyable characters to have in the movie. I also saw that they had some sort of sadness from the main character because her mother died, which would have been a great component to the story, but they didn't use it enough and there was really no point in bringing it up at all. And one more thing, if your going to have a movie centered around a mysterious monster/creature/evil thing, make sure you try to explain it a little better. I just kind of felt this movie was meant as a joke. After all, it talks about memes and the internet while having internet stars as characters in the movie.",1467936000,,1291,4.521367521367521

This movie was released in 2012, but if I told you it was released in 2008 you wouldn't be able to know he difference. All of the jokes and prods at Internet comedy are incredibly dated and awkward, as if they were written by an old man who just figured out what a tweet was.",1466985600,2,551,4.3076923076923075

None of that matters, though because the ending of the film shoots everything you've been watching in the foot. The film thinks it's being clever, but it's really just cheated the audience. What's worse the very last scene and the post credits scene invalidate even the sloppy ""twist"" ending.

This would have been a much better movie if it hadn't tried to outthink its audience. But, it did, so instead of a cypher supernatural horror film, we get what seems like a half baked commentary on the Anonymous crowd.",1462147200,,582,4.8686868686868685

5412313,4,B00AEJM61I,"I didn't expect much with this movie. I'm also fairly forgiving with horror movies, especially cheaper ones.

With that said I feel like it mostly delivered as far as typical YA/Teen slashers go.

<MINOR SPOILERS>

Plot-wise, most of the movie was predictable, hinging on the idea of the questions of which the main character was really witnessing murders, if she was crazy, or if the supernatural were involved or not. In an otherwise typical plot wondering what the answers to these questions were the height of the plot. I feel like these general ideas in the plot were interesting, but didn't meet their full potential due to the writing and some of the acting.

<END OF MINOR SPOILERS>

The acting was okay. There were some good moments, and there were some bad moments in there as well. Most of the time the acting felt rather average or not note-worthy. Caitlin Gerard probably had the strongest performance. Many of the other characters felt less developed and more one-dimensional.

Overall, I wouldn't call this an excellent movie by any means, but if you like B-level horrors or the generic teen or college generic slasher, it's probably a movie to save and watch a night when you don't have anything special to watch. If the film had some more creative writing and if the acting was a bit more refined it could have possibly been a lot better.",1460160000,,1355,4.74468085106383

People are saying that the plot is not original, there right but they need to be kinda smarter to know the writer is obsessed with bloody  mary and wanted a movie somewhat like the BM myth so he made a cyber version...and people complain about the opening kill i can argue back but its a first time film maker who didn't even edit the website into its final form.

The many unknown and few known actors pulled off a pretty good movie that didn't leave me feeling like I wanted to end it early. It kept me intrigued. Plenty of jump scares, but it never overplayed the ""monster,"" it was all just enough to keep the movie and scares going. I found myself on the edge of my seat many times.

I was a little let down with this one.  Was kinda hoping for it to be the next 'ghost face' or 'Candyman' (I suspect that's what the producers hoped too).  Didn't quite deliver in my book.  More of a 'head-game' type of flick than a true slasher.

5412384,1,B00AEJM61I,"(Member's daughter here.)  Should have listened more carefully to the other reviews.  This had to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.  And I've seen a lot of movies.  Seriously.  I wanted to kill the over-acting main character myself, before ten minutes had passed.  The script was amazingly horrible; stretched ridiculously -- and I mean, ridiculously! --  thin in multiple places.  The twists weren't twists as much as they were the next incredibly predictable scene, arms outstretched, yelling, ""Ta da!""  What terrible directing, filming, editing goes into a childish, amateurish, campy tripe like this?  How in heaven's name did this idiotic mess of a movie get someone like Roger Bart to star?  And what was he thinking!?  His scenes were the only thing worth watching... until the blathering script seeped through the edges of his words and reminded me what I was watching!  I take a chance when I buy my movies unseen, but when I do, I give the films a big grain of salt -- I can normally glean the entertainment out of anything that has something remotely well done about it.  This movie takes more than salt... it takes washing out my mouth with wasabi.

The soundtrack/audio of this movie was great. The actors were...fresh and inexperienced. The twist ending was predictable and implemented to almost comical effect. Lastly, the cinematography was not good. Too many variations in perspective and the perspectives weren't the best choice for their intentions.

Overall I'd give it a 4.5/10. It's okay if you don't take it seriously, and only worth a rewatch for laughs.",1438992000,,565,5.208791208791209
5412414,2,B00AEJM61I,"Smiley is a psychological slasher film (if one wants to accurately describe it) about the urban myth of a killer who wears a skin mask that has a smiley face carved into it.  Similar to the legend about Bloody Mary, this finds college students using a random chat room.  When they type the words I did it for the Lulz three times, Smiley will appear behind the person the message was sent to and kill them.

Ashley (Caitlin Gerard) is a meek college student, out on her own for the first time, sharing a house with another girl named Proxy.  Ashley dresses in clothes that make June Cleaver look like Nikki Minaj (and yes I did just make a Leave it to Beaver reference) but soon wild friend Proxy has her drinking and smoking pot.  While at a party Ashley hears the myth about Smiley but doesnt believe it.  The following day, Ashley and Proxy are chatting with a guy and try out the Smiley myth.  They are shocked when the killer appears behind the man, killing him.  They are terrified but don't report the incident to the police.

Ashely soon finds herself stalked by the killer and having nightmares.  She seeks help from one of her professors as well as a nerdy tech geek named Binder but it doesnt help.  Ashley begins to descend into delusional paranoia and even a detective (Keith David) dismisses her claims thinking shes nuts or on drugs.

Smiley has the twist ending that seems prerequisite in horror films these days but the problem is that Director Michael Gallagher tips his hand.  Its simply too easy to deduce that the other students are involved in Ashleys torment.  Why is a killer who is summoned by typing a phrase three times all of a sudden stalking Ashley on the streets?  Most of the actors overplay their roles which also serve to tip you off.  Frankly an actual Jason or Michael Myers serial killer would have been more interesting and the Smiley mask was kind of freaky.

Smiley does feature a couple of veteran actors in Keith David and Roger Bart and they do bring professionalism to what is otherwise a cast of unknowns.  But Davids role is brief and he doesnt show up until more than an hour into the film.  Theres not enough mayhem and gore to appeal to fans of slasher films and its not smart enough to succeed as a psychological horror either.",1438387200,,2277,4.509756097560976

I enjoyed this movie; the skillful portrayal of Ashley juxtaposed against her more socially sophisticated and callous contemporaries is brilliantly executed. The director was also successful in his ability to achieve a delicate balance between the threat of the ""legend"" and Ashley's emotional vulnerability so that we are neither convinced she was delusional or that the legitimacy of the threat should be dismissed.

It turns out to be a brilliant ploy to pull the rug out from under the feet of her classmates which made for a predictable but appropriate ending.

i had to continue to slap myself to stay awake. No horror movies should be like that.

1. Actors - bland and boring. I understand these are all.. D list actors, wannabes and youtube personalities, but it was almost like someone had explained to them how people behave and they went off that description without never having seen how people actually interact with each other. Stiff, wooden, and ultimately sad  the acting was some of the worse i've seen in any movie (and i've seen the Slaughterhouse massacre).

2. Plot - Candyman for the internet generation. However, somehow - it's so much worse. It does play on the question of what would you do if you could kill the person on the other side of the omegle chat but it never explores that really. It quickly devolves into the blonde chick screaming and running and a bunch of nonsense.

3. Filming - Shot at your local community college by the janitor. Seriously, there is no other way to say it.

5412559,1,B00AEJM61I,"This movie take a lot of buzzwords that you might overhear your kids using when their talking with your friends and goes to the utmost lengths to demonize them, Anonymous, Lulz, (which the repeat three times thing is just so corny here unlike its originater the Candyman/Bloody Mary), and a few feigned attempts at actual tech jaragon are trotted out like scary boogiemen than the titular character. I really wanted to like Smiley, I liked the makeup, he seemed like he'd be a pretty fun take on a modern day slasher. Sadly nothing could be further from the truth as all the updated slang is just their to cover the fact that every other idea in this movie is cliche at best and dated at worst.

A lot of reviews I've read say this movie ripped off Scream. The trope of 'don't trust people from the interwebs you guyz!' is what this movie is really based on, and frankly I wish it had stuck closer to Scream in that regard, at least the killers in that movie had a believable motive...and no hocus pocus ending. The final 'scare' of this movie would be called pathetically un-scary if every other scare in this movie wasn't the same telegraphed rubbish. Is a character not looking at something and the soundtrack quiet? As soon as she/he turns there will be a loud blast from the sound track and a little 'boo' whether one is deserved or not, or whether it even makes sense or not. Other horror movies have committed this crime, but at least they usually have something worth jumping about.

If your looking for a movie in the old 80's slasher movie vein, steer clear of this one. If your looking for a movie that has the same corny tropes and sarcastic humor of 90's slasher films, stay WELL clear of this one. If your looking for a movie that reduces the internet and collage communities to the lowest common denominator for no readily understandable reason and then justify it with a snatch of slang that was probably the basis for this entire movie? Go nuts, grab some popcorn. But you won;t be scared unless you jump at loud noises.

Honestly I doubt Smiley will ever be big at Halloween. Stick with Ghostface.",1402099200,3,2115,4.531413612565445

That aside, the whole internet culture thing they were going for is dated and a bit embarrassing, although that can't be helped given the nature of how fast ""memes,"" fads, and jokes go out of style on the internet. If you can forgive that, you won't be rolling your eyes TOO hard. I haven't read much of the other comments and reviews on here, but I'm guessing this is an homage to Slenderman? Not sure if anyone else mentioned that too, but when I read the description for the film, that was the first thing that popped into my head.

As a horror film, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. If you like the ""jumpy,"" ""slashy,"" types of movies, this is a good one. I wouldn't call this film gory per se, but if you're looking for dark red corn syrup, you won't be too sorely disappointed. This is the type of movie I'd tell you to watch if you can access it for free, so... I mean, I personally wouldn't spend more than 3 bucks to watch it.

Let me mention this though: watch it to the end of the credits. I don't know if anyone else did, but I happened to just leave the credits running and there were like, 2 seconds of ""action"" left at the very end (for lack of a better word).

First difference I noticed right away looked good: sound production values, none of that lo quality soap opera style filming. The acting was competent. And the killer was actually scary looking. Add to that some interesting dialogue: I'm talking the professor here. Some of what he said reflect exactly what I think about the place of humanity on the evolutionary continuum. Not to mention how and why we are probably going to be regarded at as the only suicidal species to ever have existed. I couldn't believe that I was hearing it said to me and not by me! What set this plot apart is the twist ending. And what a twist! I did not see that coming. I began to suspect something about Smiley's actual status but not at all what I got. Very nice!

I give credit to the art department for creating the Smiley mask. Someway, somehow I would like a sequel. Lastly, there is some existential talk brought up in the film (or I could be wrong. I'm not too keen in that area. I watched for the kills. Haha).

Smiley (2012) ** / 4
D: Michael Gallagher
C: Caitlin Gerard, Melanie Papalia, Shane Dawson, Andrew James Allen, Liza Weil, Toby Turner, Roger Bart, Keith David, Jason Horton
P: A myth involving a serial killer named Smiley comes to life as an unsuspecting college student tests out the urban legend by typing ""I did it for the lulz"" three times with a video chat partner only to have Smiley appear and kill off the random person she was chatting with online.

Let's be honest here. Smiley is nowhere near as bad as its reputation would leave you to believe, but on the other hand, it's not an overlooked genre effort waiting to be rediscovered either.

In Smiley, the film's central protagonist is slowly losing her grip on reality as she tries to figure out exactly what is going on around her as she investigates the urban legend surrounding Smiley. The panic, the confusion and the disorientation that this character is feeling is palpable. On the flip side of things, Smiley comes across as awfully repetitive and mistakes false scares for genuine suspense. It also takes far too long for anything, something to happen. Smiley comes across as prolonged.

Smiley is the type of film that had a potentially iconic horror movie villain and could have been a great deal of fun as any type of material involving tall tales, superstitions and urban legends lends itself to that since these are stories we grew up listening to and horror fans have an automatic fondness for them, but instead we're given a film in which we're forced to sit there and watch a character slowly lose her mind. At the end of the day, Smiley is a middle of the road slasher film effort, not the best of its kind obviously, but not the worst of its kind either. [R] 95 mins.",1385424000,,1818,4.689655172413793
5412620,4,B00AEJM61I,"So I don't usually do review's, but I did see ALOT of hate for this movie, It is understandable that not everyone would like it, yes it is cheesy and corny and its not in the league of Scream or Friday the 13th, but that is really what makes it so good. It was done by a YouTuber, TotallySketch, I've never seen his work but if he came from YouTube and this is his first bug work it is a great start. I only watched it because I saw Shane Dawson was in it from his YouTube channel, and its got a few I know besides him, Toby Turner was the other big one, the film gets hate because its not full of CG and amazing sexy 'A-List' actors and its not really super scary, its one of those movies you watch that gets you at first like 'Oh crap that was scary"" but it goes away, its like a cheap Haunted House that your apartment complex does for Halloween. Its not a bad film, its not even a crappy film, it is just what it is, a film with very little budget done by a YouTuber, it takes those crazy myths I knew as a kid in school (Bloody Mary) and modernized it with the Internet and 'Trollz' I personally liked it and enjoyed the 96 minutes I watched it, I rented it and I intend to buy it if not for how good or bad it was then for the sheer IDEA of the film.
Here are some good and bad points for the film
GOOD
fairly scary 'villain'
modern take on myths (Bloody Mary)
shows the 'Dark' side of the internet (Yes like everything the glorious internet has a dark side)
has a great ending (its a twist but I won't say it)
has some great YouTube stars and is MADE by a YouTube star
its a great first film for the director
BAD
okayish acting, its not Hollywood standard acting but it WAS still good acting
some okay camera work, I liked most of the film and how it was shot but like all films they could have done without some close ups or pan zooms or wide arcs

Really those are all the complaints I had, if your on the wall about the movie RENT it for the love of god Rent first and if you like it enough to buy it then buy it, it is only an added 3.99 if you rent it first. Well I hope you find the review helpful for what it was. On a side note, if I were forced to watch this or Sharknado, I'd rather watch SMILEY",1382227200,2,2212,3.9155555555555557

How my ratings work:
5 - I loved it
4 - I really like it
3 - I like it/Worth a look
2 - Don't like it
1 - Hate it

I'll admit that when I first saw promotional material for this movie and a trailer, I thought ""This couldn't bee too bad."" Course the more I learned about the more it sounded totally moronic. Not helping is that after you really think about it, the killer has the face of an emoticon. OMG! EMOTICONS HAVE GAINED SENTIENCE! RUN!

The legend: There's an urban legend on the internet (which just sounds odd to begin with) that if you go onto a random chat room and type to someone ""I DID IT FOR THE LULZ"" three times (when I first read this I felt my brain was gonna pop from the stupid) and a guy named Smiley comes behind the LULZ victim with a knife and I'm sure you can guess what he does next. He's called Smiley because he sewed his eyes shut vertically (and must've had some large eyes or put more effort into slicing his eyes vertically and then sewing them shut) and carved a smile on his mouth. I guess he also somehow sanded off his nose and made his nostrils disappear. This must've looked too graphic for DVDs (but not posters), because on the cover it looks like he's wearing a sack with a smile put on it (which really isn't too bad and could've been creepy), and in the movie he appears to be wearing some sort of smiley face mask with a panty stocking over it (making it look more silly, but I guess the knife helps). Maybe if he wasn't an internet based killer it would be more effective, but horror based around the internet just come off really really stupid. First off, the chat roulette in the movie (called hide and go chat) is outdated by several years, and wouldn't most these days have sound as well?

Characters/plot: our main character is Ashley (played by an actress who's name you don't need to learn because I seriously doubt she's gonna have a career after this) who's just starting college. She rents a house with another college student named Proxy (good lord) and it's clear right away that Ashley has never interacted with another human being. She spouts dialogue that just makes you go ""What is wrong with you?"" Example: *Proxy invites her to a party* ""Isn't in a school night? Oh ha, right, it's college I can do whatever I want! heh Yes, I except your invitation."" or when Proxy hands her a joint ""I think I'm high off your marijuana."" Other characters include moron hacker Zane, moron computer nerd Binder (played by a youtube celebrity apparently...wow!), a dull as crud ethics teacher who just rambles on and on and says nothing and actually asks his students what a hypothesis is (funny, I thought that was something you learn in middle school).

Ashley and Proxy think it would be hilarious to try the LULZ legend on some random person and get shocked when the person dies. This of course can't be reported because it happened on the internet, therefore the cops wouldn't take it seriously (video evidence, what's that!?). As it turns out the cops don't, as the main cop (played by Keith David, who was also in the amazingly stupid internet based horror film Chain Letter and deserves SOOOOOO much better! The dude was Goliath on Gargoyles for God sake!) says they need a body or for her to know said victims (because people only report deaths of people they know, never strangers).

Technical goofs: This movie is filled with so many continuity errors that it's just sad. And anyone who says ""It's a low budget horror film!"" that isn't a valid excuse! There are plenty of low budget horror films that still looked good (which this movie does look ok) and kept decent continuity.
Examples:

1. The opening kill girl hears about the urban legend from a girl she's baby sitting. Later at home, she goes to a random chat room and some dude with glasses who just loops with his eyebrow arching types it out to her. However, it first shows the screen as her typing it (indicated by YOU), but then shows STRANGER writing it.

2. We see said eyebrow looping dude at the party Ashley and Proxy go to, and we see him performing the LULZ and constantly see him looking at his friends and his ""video"" is still of him eyebrow looping or the video isn't on there at all (keen eyes will notice he doesn't even have a cam, built in or otherwise).

3. There's a scene where Ashley freaks out and smashes her laptop and someone films it and puts it on youtube (I can't make this up, if I could I'd have written and sold it for a quick buck). When talking to the cops, they show her the video. And you can clearly see the edit option above the video! COME ON! Would it have really been so hard to have them open the video in a different link that didn't feature that? Internet reviewers have better continuity and they have even less of a budget!

JUMP SCARES!: Every modern horror films has to have one. Not just a jump scare, but it also has to have that noise of someone banging on what sounds like a metal pan or something. Who needs atmosphere and mood? Let's just catch some people off guard with LOUD NOISES! There is a scene where I DID IT FOR THE LULZ! is painted on a wall in blood!

The ending (I gave a spoiler warning at the start, you have no right to be upset by this): Turns out that Proxy and her friends were all messing with Ashley to drive her insane, and it causes her to jump out a window (a really bad CGI window) fall on her head and kill her). They all see this as a win for Anonymous (the online hacking group for those that don't know; Apparently they like to cause people mental grief and kill people) and even the opening kill girl was in on it. NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE! The opening kill girl was all spooked out in her house, plus she heard about the legend from the girl she was babysitting. The chat room thing is random, you have no way of knowing who you're going to chat with and therefore can't set up a fake kill or real kill. Ashley encounters Smiley in a chat room, meaning someone had to be sitting there for most likely days in hopes that she eventually came across him. This whole thing also had to rely on the cops being total morons who wouldn't take her seriously. Then there's the scene where she accidently shoots Binder, who was actually rigged with a squib and she had a fake gun that was placed at Zane's house, where she went to check on him. She could've easily gotten ahold of a real gun, or not even shot Binder and just let him in the house, which would've messed with their plan. And everyone in the group finds it awesome that Ashley was killed; apparently internet geeks are sociopaths. There was no reason for them to be messing with her! Well, other than the fact that they were bored I guess and figured ""Hey, let's prank on this doofy girl! FOR THE LULZ!"" Proxy via webcam finds it awesome as well, but later questions if they're bad people (OF COURSE NOT! You only messed with a girls psyche and caused her to die!) and Zane jokingly types in LULZ and Proxy gets killed by the real Smiley! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN!

Everyone in this movie is awful! The acting is either really bad or just really bland. Once Proxy gets all nervous about Smiley, she starts showing up randomly to Ashley in an attempt to JUMP SCARE her and act crazy. The ethics teacher is so droning and bland, and his scenes are pointless and add nothing to the movie! Keith David I suppose isn't too bad, but it's not like he's in the movie long enough to make any impact. And the lead playing Ashley! MY GOD! SHE IS SOOOOOOOO BAD! She is one of the most awkward leads I've ever seen. Did the director not see her audition first? Did he really think ""Oh yeah, she's a natural."" The direction isn't too bad, but the script (co-written by the director) is just incredibly stupid. What is with modern horror films making most of the main characters either bland or just so obnoxious and or jerky that we have no reason to give a crap what happens to them? A good horror film will set up some character development and make them a little sympathetic before killing them off (like John Carpenter's Halloween or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street). This is also a tame horror film for a modern day slasher. I'm not saying gore would make it better, but at least there'd be some entertainment from the killer being over the top in his killings. But no, he just stabs people (sure, that's mostly what Michael Meyers did, but again there was mood set and had presence). That's actually another thing, Smiley isn't really in the movie much. He's mentioned a lot, but he's not around much and there aren't many kills. Again, doesn't have to be a blood bath, but most super natural killers make a show of it. Even Chain Letter had OTT gore.

5412628,2,B00AEJM61I,"I love youtube. But If I didn't already love most of these people from the internet I would deff give this a 1 star rating.  This is how all crappy ""scary movies"" are made. Quite talking and background voices but very loud during the jump shots to make you jump  while you arn't paying attention (its that boring), No options on subtitles, at least on my tv, Dark lighting to make it look ""scarier"" and low budget.
Now the acting.....Oh God.  pretty much everyone of the Youtubers are really bad actors and should stick to making funny youtube videos. The only reason they are in this movies is because the Director (Michael J. Gallagher) Is a youtuber himself. Everyone eles is terrible. l really like Shane Dawson. But eh.
The ending was so stupid. This film is perfect for a bad movie night because its just that. All in all, RENT it not buy for a night with your youtube watching friends and have a good time making fun of internet people who think they are actors/directors. Lolz",1374969600,,984,4.51685393258427

5412642,1,B00AEJM61I,"I saw the ratings go up on this movie in just the past few days, so I thought what the heck I'll give it a watch. I liked the premise for the story and thought how original until someone refreshed my memory about the chanting on Candyman and I think there are a few other movies that use repeated chant lines too. Anyway, back to the movie. It's definitely geared for the younger crowd and panders to their lifestyle and relationship with the internet, instant messaging and the anonymous interactions they share with one another. It does delve into some of the harsh realities that do take place with anonymous interactions and those who are empowered by their anonymity to do stupid stunts. Its like liquid courage they have powers that aren't possible without the anonymity or the fear of getting caught, so the movie actually does have a message in it. The three lead characters (2) girls Ashley & Proxy roomates and (1) ""Security Guru""  Zane are just plain annoying along with most of the supporting cast. Ashley's acting and screeming skills leave a lot to be desired and made the character more of a joke than than a asset. Proxy's acting was better, but she was annoying and Zane'sacting was a little to over the top and very annoying. While the story made me think how they were pulling off the kills for a while, the story got to redundant and far fetched and add the bad acting and silly interactions between the characters and I got bored. I will say that I actually did get a jump out of one scene, ;) I was impressed with some of the production values like camera work, image quality, locations and props, but the direction, acting and the worn out clich'e storylines for example the shrink, am I crazy, the cops don't believe me and the pranks and so on. These problems have been cramed down our throats to many times and have gotten ""OLD"". The writer dropped the ball on this one and could not think outside the box and instead went with the ""OLD"" clich'e standard story fillers. Was this worth the time? Yes and no, because it does have some redeeming value to it, but it also has a poorly written story and bad acting. If you are in your teens to late twenties then yes and if your older probably not. 1 star

5412661,4,B00AEJM61I,"SMILEY (2012) - Here's an urban legend film updated for the Internet Age. The legend is this: If you log into an anonymous chat room, pick a person that you don't know, concentrate real hard and then type ""I did it for the lulz"" three times (It's Internet speak for ""I did it for the laughs.""), a killer named Smiley (who stiched his eyes shut and then stitched a large smile on his face) will appear behind that person and slice their throat or stab them in the heart. We then switch to freshman college student Ashley (Caitlin Gerard; THE AWAKENING - 2010, who is very good here), a young female nerd who is trying to get over the suicide of her mother and had to be institutionalized for a short while. Rather than living in a dorm, she moves into a house close to campus with Proxy (Melanie Papalia; CONFINED - 2010), another young female who is the exact opposite of Ashley. She likes to party and have a good time, where Ashley is rather straight laced. Proxy talks Ashley into going to a party with her (after introducing Ashley to the joys of pot) at the house of rich privileged computer hacker Zane (Andrew James Allen). She also meets fellow nerd Binder (Shane Dawson), who is thrown out of the party for ratting out Zane and his friends to campus authorities for their hacking habits. After getting drunk at the party and watching a video of Smiley in action on one of Zane's computers, Ashley and Proxy go home and log into an anonymous chat room, where Proxy picks a person (a man who is buck naked) and tells Ashley to concentrate really hard (because you have to want it to happen) and type in ""I did it for the lulz."" three times. An apprehensive and still-drunk Ashley does it and, sure enough, Smiley appears behind the guy and slits his throat. He then stares directly at the screen with his sewn-shut eyes. This freaks Ashley out, fearing that Smiley now knows who she and Proxy are. Ashley then believes that Smiley is after her (the dreams she has are very vivid) and goes to psychiatrist Dr. Jenkins (Liza Weil; STIR OF ECHOES - 1999), who prescribes her an anti-anxiety drug and threatens to recommit her if she gets worse. She also has discussions with psychology teacher Professor Clayton (an excellent Roger Bart; HOSTEL PART II - 2007), who tells her that all humans in general are doomed to extinction and it is only a matter of time before it happens (it's also refreshing that he never hits on her, except jokingly). I'll leave the rest for you to discover, as it didn't turn out the way I thought it was going to, which is always a plus in my book. For those that don't bother watching the closing credits to a film, I recommend you stay until the end for a stinger that changes everything. Director/co-writer/co-executive producer Michael J. Gallagher (his first theatrical effort, even if it only played for one week before going the DTV route) has created an inventive new character in Smiley (along with co-writer/co-executive producer Glasgow Phillips, who directed the funny Western zombie flick UNDEAD OR ALIVE - 2007) and fills the film with plenty of jump scares, which are usually nothing but somebody suddenly appearing in frame while the music amps up in volume, but it did manage to make me jump a couple of times (something that most modern horror films don't do to me). The inventive finale really surprised me, but there are clues along the way (especially if you watch it a second time) that doesn't make it seem that it is just coming out of left field, like most modern horror films where the writers and directors don't know how to properly end a film. SMILEY thankfully doesn't suffer that fate (and the stinger after the final credits is also a plus) and Roger Bart as Professor Clayton is such an interesting character, I wish I could go back to college and have him as a teacher. The acting and technical aspects are also above par for such a low-budget film and while there is some blood and gore, it doesn't rely on it to get the point across. In other words, I enjoyed it. It's nothing spectacular, mind you, just an entertaining update of all those urban legends that scared the shit out of us when we were kids. Also starring Keith David (as a police detective who really has nothing to do besides disbelieve everything Ashley tells him), Toby Turner, Jana Winternitz, Nikki Limo, Steve Greene, Richard Ryan and Michael Traynor as Smiley.

5412671,1,B00AEJM61I,"I try to avoid hyperbolic reviews. I don't give perfect scores to things to ""even out"" the rating, nor do I slap a 1/5 or 1/10 on everything that isn't perfectly aligned with my tastes and expectations. I try to be reasonable with my scores because when a film comes along that truly deserves that low rating, I want it to actually mean something. Smiley is that film.

There are two main audiences for this film. The first is tweens who follow members of the cast on youtube (yes, this is that kind of movie). I'm guessing most of the 5 star reviews come from this section of the audience. The other half of the target audience is, naturally, horror fans. In particular, Smiley aims to fit into the slasher niche with a knife-wielding deformed supernatural stalker/killer terrorizing a college campus (or is he? DUN DUN...DERP). It's not a revelatory setup, but still one that could provide the necessary kicks. I never expected Smiley to reach the heights of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, The Burning, etc. But with a budget of 1 million (far more than most similar b-horror films), a creepy villain, and a decent setup I thought I was at least guaranteed a mediocre modern slasher flick with some entertainment value. I wasn't expecting Scream, or even Scream 3. But my low expectations did not prepare me for just how cliche, grating, and empty this film would be.  The budget is used well enough and creates a deceptive visual sheen. Unlike many low budget horror flicks Smiley looks rather decent. Unfortunately, it is creatively bankrupt. The script is groan inducing, the performances are embarrassing (with the exception of Roger Bart and Keith David, but more on that later), the scares are utterly cliche, and there are no notable sequences with the (totally underused) villain. And the ""kills"" are tame and obscured. Smiley is a massive missed opportunity, and it seems criminal that such a substantial budget was wasted on this uninspired, insulting mess. The laughably bad (and completely stolen) ending just adds salt to the wound. By the time the credits roll, you get the feeling that you've been subjected to a film-length teaser trailer.

Smiley wants very badly to achieve a sort of ""Scream meets A Nightmare on Elm Street"" feel. It also borrows obvious themes from films like Candyman, and just about any campus slasher you can name. But it all just feels like a cheap joke at the audience's expense. No one who enjoys horror films will find anything to like here (I know how that sounds, and I didn't believe it either). It completely misses the point of the genre. Only the uninitiated (and the cast/crew's youtube subscribers) could find value in this. If you're considering ignoring the negative reviews (I did, because I'm stubborn in that way) I can only suggest that you under no circumstances pay for this film. I only lost my time, and I still felt cheated. The true horror of Smiley would be knowing that you actually paid these people to bore you for 90 minutes and then spit in your face. Do yourself a favor and seek out something that is more worth your time.

But I mentioned Roger Bart and Keith David, and since they both are far too talented to be in this mess I feel obliged to note a few things. Each of these veterans puts in a fine performance. Roger Bart as a slightly unhinged professor is the sole diversion in a pale and unamusing film. Keith David only shows up for about 5 minutes, and does make those 5 minutes more compelling, but it's too little too late. Both of these guys deserve better, and so do you.",1369699200,,3582,4.680952380952381
5412672,1,B00AEJM61I,"Really?! someone thought using the S.A. Goons as the basis for a horror movie was a good idea?!
For those wondering who I am talking about; the Goons are the denizens of the Something awful.com forum and are also the most notorious of trolls on the net whose tag line is ""we do it for the lulz"".
The goons are a blight to anything with user interactivity (yes that DOES include amazon) and to validate these tools with this insipid movies it just mind-blowing.
Anyway, I'll make this short and sweet, the characters were so dis-likeable that their deaths were something to be cheered, the idea of Smiley is interesting but the pathetic script and the horrible acting so over-shadowed the title character I couldn't find it within myself to express anything more than a passing interest is the Smiley design.
In all honesty this was really nothing more than a run of the mill ""supernatural"" slasher flick using bloody mary and the S.A. goons tag line a the foundation for the script.

I DID IT FOR THE LULZ.

Ashley (Caitlin Gerard) goes to college and rents a room off campus. She meets a crowd of other young people and is exposed to an ""urban legend"" about Smiley, a killing who appears and kills the person you are chatting with if you type in a sentence three times...and really want it.

Ashley also attends a class which discusses Occum's Razor among other things that tie into the overall theme.

The killer appears.

The film is less slasher and more of a psychological thriller. The problem I had was the action centered around Ashley who didn't do enough to excite me. The characters were not well developed. Had this film been done with different actors and a slightly better script it would have been killer, instead of just another me-too slasher.

5412704,2,B00AEJM61I,"This movie had a very creative storyline, but the made-up urban legend needed to be a bit tweaked and more creative and realistic.  This movie idea had the potential of being a very terrifying movie and the budget didn't have anything to do with it.

The two main actresses had me wondering:  When they were casting this movie, were these two the best they could find? Surely there are better actresses out there as these two were not believable, acted more like silly girls that sighed before every sentence and giggled after everything they said.  The screenplay and dialogue wasn't even believable.  College students do not act nor speak as

The girl that was in the first scene was way too old for the part, when her ""father"" came out I couldn't tell if he was supposed to be her Dad or her boyfriend.

Andrew James Allen was by far, the most interesting character (as well as the most experienced actor) in the move and his skill level clearly outshined everyone else.

I didn't like the lead actress. I thought she did a very bad acting job. Some of the other actors didn't do too bad. I was let down by this movie. I saw it as a missed opportunity. I don't see this movie on par with Scream or the first I Know What You Did Last Summer. Even Urban Legend might be better than this mess. I didn't like the ending. I spent ten bucks on the dvd and I am going to trade it in soon. I'll say for true diehard slasher fans I would check it out still. Everyone is different. If you are looking for a good slasher that came out recently I suggest 'Silent Night' starring Jamie King and Malcom Mcdowell. Scream 4 is also a good one too bad it did poorly at the box office and there likely won't be another Scream. But any way I'd only rent this or see it on cable for free. Cheers!

The pacing of the movie is decent, the story is okay, but the acting and the script were quite bad, even for a genre flick like this one.

That being said any person handing this film one star is no film junkie and certainly no horror film junkie.  There are far worse acted and directed films on the market today by far.  Was this a masterpiece of modern horror...no.  Do I think it was intended to be...no.  How can one watch a horror film about a mass murderer named Smiley and take it seriously?  All that being said Smiley delivered with the chills and threw in a couple of twists whether predicatable or not suited the feal of the film well.  Kind of a modernized Nightmare on Elm Street/Candyman type for me...at least those are the films I found myself comparing it to while watching.

Veteran actors Keith David in a glorified cameo and Roger Bart as a cliched professor manage to outact the youthful ensemble.

This spring/summer did help turn it around with some amazing creepy/thrillers, so I decided to be optimistic and give this movie a shot.

The Good:
I give the ending some credit. Some could have seen it coming; I sort of did, but it was still better than how some flicks wrap things up... and that's really the only good I can think of.

The Bad:
Everything about this movie is just bad. It doesn't even hit B-movie due to the over acting, unbelievable plot (though I will credit updating Bloody Mary, but lulz made me not find it creepy nor amusing). The characters were grating at best, and at the worst, you kept hoping they would actually just die.
The lulz plot, as stated before, gave me a migraine and eye twitch due to how it was portrayed. I can't tell if the movie knew it was a joke and tried to push said joke or was trying to be so serious about itself. And the truth of the matter is I didn't care. By the time the movie was wrapping up, I moved to read notes for a class since I figured that would hold my attention better. It was very disjointed, jumping around, and with the characters being out of character at times and bi-polar at best in others.

At the end of the movie, perhaps this makes sense, but then again, I feel as though the actors were the type you'd put on a stage to do Shakespeare (b/c at least the over acting would make some resemblance of sense).
Tip from one horror movie fan to another: Don't buy, don't rent, don't care. It's sort of a stab in the back to the true horror genre as there isn't anything remotely scary or 'check your closet' about this.",1360108800,4,1753,4.226865671641791

She comes off as this super whiny, easily freaked out, naive twit. It was completely annoying. I just kept wishing she would shut up. The rest was rather hum drum and not really scary. I mean if you want to kill time and watch some YouTubers doing something different from their regular vlogs and skits, go ahead and watch it. But if you're expecting something original and awesome, look elsewhere.",1360022400,5,701,4.358778625954199
5412737,1,B00AEJM61I,"When I first heard about this movie, I was very excited.  The trailer looked scary as hell, and the premise was new and original for the slasher subgenre within horror.  The mask was awesome (and still is), plus, Keith David (John Carpenter's The Thing, They Live, There's Something About Mary) was in it, how could it be bad?  I was telling people about it, genuinely excited for its release.  I even shelled out money to the website that the movie would premiere on, promising behind the scenes looks into the 'Making Of'.  I joined their video submission contest to see if it would get into the movie.  Independent movies like this, especially horror, are what really give fans things that are new and original, so I am happy to support them.

And then I saw it.

Now, this follows the fact that a week before the movie was set to premiere on VOD, the whole idea was shaken up, and AMC Theaters bought the rights to show the movie in various cities around the country, mine included.  Great!  I went to the theater, and watched.  Good God, I can't describe what happens next.

It's awful.  Not just regular awful, God-awful.  Not 'so bad it's good', this movie reaches levels of 'so bad, it's completely embarrassing'.  That in and of itself is interesting, because this is the type of movie that is so bad, it actually is worth discussing, surpassing all bad movies before it, into something completely new.  I would even consider having this sitting on my shelf to show people just how bad things can get in the movies.  Have you ever been water-boarded?  Just watch this movie.  You want to put hot spikes into your eyes?  Don't worry, this movie fills in as an equivalent, it'll do the trick!

The story is about a girl, Ashley, who goes off to college after her mother dies.  She has a fractured relationship with her dad (of course), and afraid of making close friendships of any kind.  She meets her roommate, Proxy (seriously, that's her name), and a weird subculture of hackers, including guys named Zane, Binder, and Flasher (seriously, those are their names).  She learns of an urban legend of a killer named Smiley, who kills people over internet video chat rooms.  Whenever someone chats with someone over the system, and says ""I did it for the LULZ"" three times (yea, seriously, it's really bad), Smiley will appear from behind them, and kill them on screen for that person to see.  So, of course, the characters all do this throughout the movie, people die, Ashley gets worried, blah, blah, blah.  This all leads to the end, where it is supposedly a huge twist, but turns out to be nothing more than a lame excuse to try and salvage this movie.  I mean, did you read what I just described, because all of that is true.  It's in the movie.

The offenders are writer/director Michael Gallagher and lead actress, Caitlin Gerard, who plays Ashley.  I do give *some* credit to the original idea here.  But that is where it stops.  Gallagher should be kicked out of all writing and directing circles, and forced to film The Howling Part 8 or Child's Play 7 as his next feature, if he makes another one at all, only.  That's it.  I'm not sure he's capable of something better to be honest, and it's a shame, because there were some great ideas here, completely squandered away with the weakest of weak scripts, and pathetic film-making duties.

Of course, there's also the lead actress, Caitlin Gerard, who I most recently saw in a McDonald's commercial.  That's right, she is such a good actress, she scored a spot in a silent McDonald's commercial, as a girl who plays horseshoes.  I can't make this up folks, this might be the worst performance ever captured on film.  She is not believable as a damsel in distress, she can't scream IN A HORROR MOVIE, hell, she can't even party or vomit right on film.  If she is ever in another film, I think it would be OK for the film-makers to threaten the studio to quit before moving forward with her, even as an extra.

Are you still here?  How could I have written so much about this thing?  I'm telling you, this movie is new to the word, bad.  Curious about this thing now?  If you are a fan of horror, sure, give it a whirl, and see what never to do as a writer, director, actor, casting director, anything.  This is a cautionary tale about what not to do.  How they roped Keith David in, I will never understand, he deserves better than this.  Enemies deserve better than this.  Amazon should really allow 0 stars, because 1 is WAY too good for this.  But if you are still inclined, watch at your own risk.  It'll be the most fun you had since you squeezed lemon juice in your open wound, and cleaned it out with a wire brush.",1360022400,52,4686,4.519047619047619
5412738,1,B00AEJM61I,"I just finished watching Smiley on Amazon on Demand. I was dissapointed. The best part of the movie is the cool looking cover. Spoiler Alert - The basics of this movie is about a typical confused 18 year old girl who is socially awkward and very naive. She gets drawn into a ridiculous idea about a urban legend from a group of pot smoking college age teens, involving an internet chat room and speaking some goofy phrase will bring out a so called serial killer that causes the deaths of the person you are chatting with. I think a very similar movie has already been done before, at least once. I feel its time to move on from the teen based horror film and into more of the modern horror film construct with a more complex story and cast. I am very happy I didn't buy this movie. I had it ordered, then after I watched it, I immediatly canceled the order. Their are allot more horror movies to buy that are much much better.

8550583,2,B00AEJM61I,"Smiley has a plot similar to Candyman, in that Smiley is summoned when users on an internet chat room type in ""I did it for the Luls""  3 times. Kind of lame, I know. Smiley is supposed to then kill (via stabbing) whoever is on the receiving end of the mantra. But the film is really a confused mess, in that it also suggests that Smiley will then go after the person who sent the mantra. Again, this is not clear in the film, which adds to the mess.

The film is not scary, though there are several jump scares with very LOUD music/drums, etc. The jump scares are done well -- but, what is the point? The basic action of the film is repetitive and slow-moving. The actors deliver their lines very well. I know this is contrary to what many other reviews say. I disagree: the actors are acting like teenagers/ freshman in college often act: Know-it-all jerks, for the most part. The problem is that the dialog they are given is often banal and ridiculous. You have the writers to blame for this-- especially when the kids start talking about Smiley, and where he came from, etc. The normal teen-age talk, though, passes muster.

The ending is pure WTF? It really makes no sense. It seems like a different ending was tacked on, to make  a ""twist"". But, the ""twist"" ending does not really match up with anything that previously occurred in the film. The director/writers must have been thinking: the film is lame, so how can we really screw with people's heads, so they won't know what hit them? Smoke and mirrors, and maybe the audience won't notice.",1517184000,,1548,4.4787234042553195

I saw this movie when it first came out at a premiere and liked it then i forgot about it for a few years then discovered it again on amazon. Im glad i purchased it again cuz i clearly didn't rememebr how good of a horror film this was, the acting was fantastic and so werw the characters. Although the brunette at the very beginning of the movie was hott and i wished she didn't have to die before the intro title. The blonde actress was okay to i don't know her in any other films but she played her character well. I recommend this movie to horror fans if you haven't seen it already!",1513468800,,693,4.140740740740741
8550585,3,B00AEJM61I,I saw this film once and enjoyed it so I bought it for my personally home collection. On a later day a friend and I decided to watch it again. When watching it again I realized that the acting is terrible. Really really terrible. And the cinematography is very simple and none experamenting. Its good for a movie made from fans donation money. But its no horror movie Id confided it a thriller. But I did enjoy the ending very much. D give it a 4 outta 10,1509321600,,455,4.181818181818182
