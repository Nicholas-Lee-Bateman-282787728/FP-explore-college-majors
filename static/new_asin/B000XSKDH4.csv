3005404,5,B000XSKDH4,"This contains the three CBC/Disney Channel/PBS co-produced mini-series based on the Lucy Maud Montgomenry books starring Megan Follows as the complex Anne Shirley.

The first Anne of Green Gables begins the story of Anne Shirley, she is an orphan with her head in the clouds and usually a book.  Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert ask for a foster child to help out at their farm.  Instead of the boy they expected, Anne Shirley arrives.  They agree to keep her for the time being but Anne's head in the cloud constantly gets her in trouble.  But what Marilla sees in Anne is herself and Matthew loves her spunk.  Anne proves that she is quite intelligent and excells at the local school.  Diana Berry becomes her best bossom buddy for life.  While Gilbert Blythe becomes her love interest but she is not speaking to him because of his continual kidding.  Anne trains to become a province teacher but decides to give it up when Matthew sudenly dies.

This introduced us to the incredible Megan Follows who shined in as Anne.  It also gave great roles to two American treasures, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth.

In Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel (a.k.a. Anne of Avonlea), Anne's adventures in Avonlea continue.  Anne wants to be a writer but everything submitted is rejected.  That is until life long bossom buddy Diana Berry submits it to a writng competition and it wins.  Anne gets a posting in Kingsport at an exclusive girls school.  But she finds out that the Pringles run this town and she took the place of one of their clan.  She spends the rest of the movie converting everyone over.  On the romance side, Diana gets married but Anne rejects Gilbert's proposal.

Once again, Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst give great performances and are joined by the great Wendy Hiller as the head of the Pringle clan (although she really can't stand her relatives.)

Part 3 is Anne of Green Gables: The Story Continues.  Anne is continuing her ambitions as a writer and her love for Gilbert Blythe.  But WWI breaks out and Gilbert enlists.  When Gilbert goes missing it's upto Anne to find him. (By the way this is not based on a LMM book but fans wanted closure, so the producers made this final episode!)

This is a much more serious episode but Megan Follows shows you she is up to it.

This new set has all three mini-series plus two documentaries and a lost mini - episode.

If you want a DVD set that is good for the whole family.  It is well written and directed.  While it comes from books that are for children, the series is just told from a young girl's point of view but the film makers give it an adult treatment.",1200960000,10,2630,4.585836909871245
3005405,5,B000XSKDH4,"Anne of Green Gables The Collection
This DVD collection consists of all three Anne movies - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Green Gables -The Sequel and Anne of Green Gables -The Continuing Story. There are audio commentaries on each of the discs as well as additional bonus features such as additional footage, deleted scenes, the missing episode ""Marilla Cuthbert's Death"", and two new documentaries ""L.M. Montgomery Island"" and  ""Kevin Sullivan's Classic"", as well as a featurette on WWI , a historical commentary by Kevin Sullivan. Here's a brief review of each of the Anne movies:
Anne of Green Gables
I loved reading the Anne of Green Gables stories when I was a teenager, and then I discovered the DVDs as an adult, and found that Anne's story will always be a treasured classic, one that I can watch over & over again. The story of the orphan Anne who is taken in by two siblings, Matthew & Marilla Cuthbert is so appealing for all the characters are people we can relate to & love. Anne is a fiery, wilful redhead, played excellently by Megan Fellows. She is ambitious, hot-tempered, and yet possesses a vulnerability that makes her so lovable. Richard Farnsworth is amazing as the soft-spoken Matthew Cuthbert who loves Anne unconditionally, and Colleen Dewhurst plays Marilla Cuthbert, an aging spinster, who seems like a curmudgeon, but is really a softie when it comes to Anne...the stories of Anne's adventures will make your heart sing, and yearn for more innocent times, when kids played with a carefree spirit, and no worries...when imagination was put to good use, and the great outdoors were a main source of entertainment.
Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel
Contrary to some reviews, I truly enjoyed this DVD. Megan Fellowes reprises her role as Anne Shirley, who embarks on an adventure when she takes up a teaching position at Kingsport Ladies College, finding challenges & romance along the way...but as always, Anne finds her way back to Avonlea. I won't give too much away here, but suffice to say that this DVD is worth watching[ despite being very loosely adapted from the books] if only because all the characters are played so well by the actors/actresses. Megan Fellowes performance is truly a joy to watch, she is an amazing actress with a great range of emotions, and the story flows smoothly, with humor, heartache, and romance. What more could one ask for?
Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story
This was the worst in the Anne series and is only worth watching for Megan Fellowes' performance. As always, she does an amazing job as Anne, and in fact I could never imagine any other actress doing justice to Anne's character! Back to the DVD, I felt that the writers did a poor job of continuing Anne & Gilbert's story...they got them married off in a jiffy [when so many fans were eagerly anticipating a nice, long-drawn fairytale wedding], and then after a brief stint in NY, Gilbert enlists in WW I! So, Anne of course has to go find him when he is reported missing, and the adventures she encounters along the way make up the rest of the story. This sequel is definitely the weakest in the DVD trilogy, but nevertheless a worthwhile watch, if only to see Anne again, and if you yearn for the Anne of before...then I suggest watching the earlier two DVDs which are far superior in production and acting to this one.
CONCLUSION - I'd only recommend purchasing this DVD set if you don't already own the individual DVDs and are keen to view the new documentaries. Actually, it might help to shop around as I've seen this DVD set retailing at much less at other places. Also, there's a new Kevin Sullivan production of Anne titled ""Anne of Green Gables - a New Beginning, which purports to trace Anne's life before she came to live with the Cuthberts, but which apparently is not based on the LM Montgomery books.  I'm not sure as to when this DVD is being released, but some fans might want to wait till all four Anne movies are released in one complete set.",1174176000,8,3993,4.686609686609686
3005406,4,B000XSKDH4,"We just opened up the DVD series the other day and went to watch the last disc (4) of the series and it was damaged.  It appears the settings were off on the DVD machine that produced this disc.  Other than that it's a good series to watch for families looking for good clean entertainment.  Hopefully, I can get a hold of Amazon and resolve the problem.",1523232000,,354,4.253731343283582
3005407,5,B000XSKDH4,"I bought Anne of Green Gables collectors edition as a gift for my Mom and sort of for myself. As one other purchaser said in their review, the DVD's were grainy in visual texture. I adjusted my TV's controls and this corrected for the graininess of the picture quality. We both enjoy watching Anne, Dianna, Mathew, and Marilla (or is it Murilla?). The documentary portion of the package describing the director Kevin Sullivan's decision making processes and how the actors were cast along with all of the other information was interesting and worth watching.
If you buy this version of Anne of Green Gables beware of the picture quality because you most likely will have to adjust your TV's or DVD players' controls and features to correct for the picture quality.",1522713600,,764,4.8396946564885495

3005438,5,B000XSKDH4,"I have the Anne of Green Gables (whole set) in VHS. I so wanted to get the collection with Megan Follows in a more ""permanent"" format. I've only begun watching the first disc. It's a little difficult as it's not made for the new TV's (the excellent condition worked perfectly 1980's RCA TV was destroyed in the tornado much to my dismay and other's happiness) and I'm trying to figure out how to make it quite fit. In regular mode, I lose top and bottom and the video is pretty grainy. This new TV doesn't come with a setup to fix this issue (or I can't find it) so I'm having to make do with my old DVD player remote by using the zoom feature and making it 1/2 screen. That works perfectly for me - it has black on either side but sits very well in the center. Color is great, sound is great. There have been a couple of ""wobbles"" (like the film sort of dragged and then jumped forward to place about one or two seconds) -  enough for me to see it and wonder, but not enough to mess with the vision or the current film. I'm enjoying it and glad that I purchased it.  The newer Anne in the updated versions just does not have the winsomeness, wittiness, and acting ability as Megan Follows (in my opinion).",1508803200,,1206,4.193965517241379

Then I saw this version and jumped at it. I didn't see until after my order was on its way that there some negative reviews of this edition, citing disc errors and glitches. However, seeing as these reviews were several years old, and recent reviews didn't mention any problems, I thought I'd give them a chance when they arrived. I'm glad I did! All the discs work perfectly, and I'm very satisfied with the video quality! It may not be quite up to the standards we normally expect for DVD, but it's still a great deal better than the VHS copies I had!

3005648,5,B000XSKDH4,I enjoyed this series and liked the beautiful scenery of the different shots on location of PEI and the various farm scenes outside of Toronto.  The story of the early 1900's is very will done.  The Anne character shows the importance of a good self respect image that an individual needs to succeed in society.  We need more movies of this same quality today.  Please note that the origin filming was done in 16 mm and was later upgraded to digital on the first 2 discs. I also enjoyed the interviews with the actors.  They were all in agreement that the series had to be made and enjoyed the making of the story into the film and later video.,1403222400,5,644,4.378151260504202

It is nothing like the book....it isn't even remotely close to the story.  It is a crazy war movie with seduction and murder!!  Not things I think of when I think of Annes treasured Prince Edward Island paradise.  Other that the 3rd movie I was very happy with this set and highly reccomend it.

3005672,5,B000XSKDH4,"This set of movies has been a family tradition for over twenty years. The movie has ""depth"" in its story and the scenery is beautiful. The set is a series, therefore it's best to watch them in order. It's the story of Anne, an orphan girl who is adopted by mistake as the caregivers had ordered a ""boy"" to help out.  Anne begs to prove herself worthy of being kept. She tries really hard to be ""good"", but always seems to find herself in some type of innocent mishap of one kind or another.  Anne quickly wins herway into the caregiver's hearts (and the viewer's hearts as well).  The 2nd movie picks up with her friends getting married, her own college desires and ""love"".  These two are truly heartwarming.  The third movie starts with her marriage, then her husband and other friends being shipped off to war. She can't handle the separation and joins the war movement herself in hopes of finding and serving with her beloved. This one obviously has a heavier tone to it, but is still worth seeing.  Megan Follows was the perfect pick for the starring role.  Everyone was perfectly cast, and really no one stands out above any of the others.  In our family's oppinion it just a PERFECT movie..can't think of even one negative point.  If I could only own one family movie - this would be it!",1390694400,,1293,4.4914529914529915

3005676,5,B000XSKDH4,"This series is based on the popular books and it doesn't disappoint. The video quality is okay but that is to be expected because nowadays with HD everything seems not perfect. It follows the life of orphan Anne Shirley. It is ultimately a love story. If you have read the book you will notice certain discrepancies but I guess they took some liberties to make the series more exciting towards the end. I doesn't matter you'll love the characters and their stories anyway. I mean, who doesn't love Gilbert Blythe?",1390089600,,513,4.711111111111111
3005677,5,B000XSKDH4,"I was first introduced to movies 1 & 2 when I was a late teen (over a decade ago), during one of the PBS telethons.  I had not read the books before, so I had nothing to compare them to (perhaps that's a good thing).

For me, the acting is top notch, the storyline uplifting, scenery/locations breathtaking, and the score *particularly the theme* enthralling (although not included on the soundtrack, the piano rendition by Jonathon Lee is amazing)!
I can't believe it's taken me this long to add to my collection.

In November I was able to finally purchase the book set, and have since eagerly devoured books 1-8.
I highly recommend any fan of the movie series to do this; there's so much depth to the story than is portrayed on screen!

I will say that I'm a tad disappointed now in regards to the 2nd movie, being it contains very little of the events and characters of book 2,  and basically skipped all of book 3 (which chronicles Anne & Gilbert's 4 college years at Redmond).
Too, we see the formation of new characters; combining 2 or 3 originals into one.  For example, Morgan Harris = Roy Gardner (book 3), and Mr. Grayson (book 4); Emmeline Harris = Sophie Sinclaire, & Elizabeth Grayson (book 4) ; Margaret Harris =  Miss Sarah Pringle, Mrs. Campbell, &  Mrs. Adoniram Gibson (book 4);  Pauline Harris = Pauline Gibson (book 4).
I suppose it had to be done to accommodate the merging of books 2-4 into one cohesive story.  But I would have preferred that the movies stayed closer to the books.  Really, it would have been better to leave out book 4, and focus on books 2, 3, & 5  for the second movie, and 6-8 for the third.

I haven't seen the 3'd movie in years; but have plans as soon as I finish pt. 2 of the second movie.
 Unfortunately, it really doesn't follow any of LMM's book series at all (aside from one event).
The books were set in the late Victorian era (1876- onward; for in-depth info on each books timeline, etc. go here: anneofgreengables.wikia(DOT)com/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_Wiki ), whereas the movies are set in the mid to late Edwardian period.
The last book in the ""Anne"" set- ""Rilla of Ingleside""- takes place during WW1, but is centered around her oldest children.
The only semi-consolation is, at least Megan (Anne), and Jonathan (Gilbert) reprise their roles, and gives fans a little closure for their characters romantic storyline; along with some deleted scenes.
_______
I chose to go with the ""Collector's Edition"", being my research has lead me to believe the ""Restoration"" is not much of an improvement-- at least for the money; and the 4th movie sounds like a downright abomination!

In conclusion, I highly recommend this series for those that enjoy period drama, or are looking for something suitable for family viewing (at least 1 & 2)!  I feel this trilogy series really brings to life the essence of this beloved book series, and for that- despite some major changes- I'll still give it 5 stars!

 Other film adaptations like it: ""Christy"" (short lived TV series 1994/95) based on Catherine Marshall's novel.  And a brand new television series by the Hallmark channel entitled ""When Calls the Heart"", based on Janette Oke's ""Canadian West"" book series.

**Side note, there is an interesting interview here with Kevin Sullivan about the movies, and some reasons of his for writing them the way he did:  avonlea.hu/guide/interviews/kevin_sullivan
As mentioned in that interview, there was a lawsuit between him and LMM's heirs, so perhaps that had a bearing on the storyline of the 3'd movie?  Perhaps this is also why nobody else has attempted to make another adaptation? ...I for one would be interested in seeing another interpretation more true to the books, but I have doubts that it will ever happen.**",1390003200,9,4134,5.0768094534711965
3005678,2,B000XSKDH4,"This is beautiful, enchanting, charming, amusing,  but...so wrong. I read all the books in the Anne of Green Gables series. I know the stories too well, I suppose, because all the differences became annoying. Numerous large and small matters were changed.

---------- SPOILERS BELOW -----------

HOW THESE DVDs DIFFERED FROM THE BOOKS:

Matthew Cuthbert's death, Anne and Gilbert's wedding, Diane Barry never became rich -- that was Jane.  Anne almost married the wrong man -- but it wasn't the guy portrayed in this film -- she almost married a rich guy she met in college. After Matthew died, Anne and Marilla helped to bring up two orphaned children in the books (Davy and Dora, if memory serves) but they were left out of the series.

As for the continuing story, the house at Green Gables was never vandalised, and Anne and Gilbert never lived there. Furthermore, Gilbert never went to war -- that was the next generation, Anne and Gilbert's sons went to war, as depicted in Rilla of Ingelside. All the scene involving the Germans and the secret spy guy are totally invented.

Why not stick to the books? There was plenty of material.

Also, the TV series did not portray Marilla correctly -- did not show her developing love for the unexpected orphan. For example, in book 1 Anne broke her leg falling off the roof and became unconscious. When Mr. Barry carried her home, Marrilla thought she might be dead and realized how much Anne had come to mean to her.  However, in the movie, Anne did not break a leg, she only twisted an ankle, but even worse, Marilla did not almost start to cry.",1389830400,,1594,4.684587813620071
3005679,5,B000XSKDH4,This is a must see for everyone-the story is wonderful and the scenery and acting are superb! This is a great family movie!,1388880000,,123,4.391304347826087
3005680,4,B000XSKDH4,"It is soooooo nice to have this 5 disc collection of a really poignant coming of age story of Anne Shirley, a bright yet fiery redhead.  The film is exactly as I remember it.  The DVDs are nicely displayed in a fold-out case.  The only thing that loses a star is the video quality--it is nowhere near today's HD standards as it is a bit grainy.  I do feel it is well worth the purchase as the story is wonderful and brings back a lot of really cool memories of my family watching this together many years ago.",1388793600,,509,4.163265306122449
3005681,5,B000XSKDH4,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas so she could watch it with her daughters like her and I did when she was a child. Even the neighbor girls watched it with us. We would set aside whole days to do our ""Anne"" marathon. Wonderful family movie.",1388707200,,250,4.229166666666667
3005682,5,B000XSKDH4,"Amazing family movie, invite grandparents along for a memory making moment, we did it in sections weekly coupled with family dinners",1388275200,,132,5.333333333333333
3005683,5,B000XSKDH4,I got these for my wife.  She always loved every episode or every film series.  It made her smile for a long time.,1387756800,,114,3.9130434782608696
3005684,5,B000XSKDH4,Just like I remember it as a child.  I really enjoyed sharing this classic with my children.  Love how it chronicles a female's life from childhood all the way through adulthood with great character.,1387670400,,199,4.823529411764706
3005685,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love the Anne of Green Gables films. If I didn't have a problem with the product itself, this review would be having 5 stars. These movies are rather long. I recently was finally able to sit down and watch the last portion of this DVD set, and I sadly came across a scene that glitched out - blue and green blanked out screen. This was purchased over the summer, so it is out of the 30 day window, so I am not sure if there is anything I can do about it now.

I love these movies and am just really disappointed that this DVD set holds digital glitches.

::UPDATED REVIEW::

I ended up contacting Amazon to explain what had happened with this order of mine. They were very gracious and offered to exchange my defective set for a new one that's hopefully not defective! That being said, this gets a 5 star review now due to this help that I received and so far, no glitches, but I do have more of the set to go through yet!",1387584000,,924,4.122222222222222
3005686,5,B000XSKDH4,"The playback quality is excellent: bright colors, clear sound - important because the entire movie series was shot with the background scenery as a integral part of the story.  Good ""mechanics"" - we found only 1 skip in the entire series.  Bonus features are a real plus - the producer's great care in selection of scenery, selection of actors/actresses (Canadians were selected above more famous U.S. counterparts to preserve the Canadian heritage of the original book, for instance), bonus features, and explanation of historical background and cultural details to tie the movie into the original book and TV mini-series were all very nice touches.  Well worth the additional price of the Collector set",1387065600,,704,5.212389380530974
3005687,5,B000XSKDH4,I could watch this movie over and over and I never get tired of it.  Such a cute and darling family movie.  We are so excited to have our own copy for Christmas this year.,1384473600,,171,3.857142857142857
3005688,5,B000XSKDH4,"The DVDs were everything I expected. It's such a delightful, wholesome story. I loved the book as a child and Meagan Follows was the perfect Anne (with an ""e"").  Delivery was prompt and problem free. It was a really good experience.",1384300800,,232,4.658536585365853
3005689,5,B000XSKDH4,"This is a gift for my Granddaughter's birthday.  She ""grew up"" with Anne & Diana and even chose 'Annes Theme' for her Wedding music.  I have this collection and have enjoyed using it.",1383609600,,183,4.515151515151516
3005690,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love this series.  I bought this dvd set to watch with my mom as it was one of our favorites....there will never be another Anne other than Megan Fellows in my book.  We watched this for a ""girls night"" and it even piqued my dad's interest and he eventually ended up watching the series with us.  The actors selected for this depiction of LM Montgomerys series are by far the most perfect and I have been spoiled by them as I cannot watch any other versions of the story.",1383436800,2,473,4.233333333333333

3005692,5,B000XSKDH4,"Great for children in today's smartphone culture.  People talked to one another.  People cared for one another. A realistic view of life in the years leading up to World War One.  No foul language whatsoever.  Amazing how this production company could round up the same people some fifteen years later for the sequel.  The people look older in the sequel because they are older. Marriage is honored in this movie, as God intended it to be.  Nice to see women wearing women's clothing instead of men's clothing.",1382572800,,510,4.804597701149425

My daughter is starting to get into the series so it is growing on me.  Great series for a young girl.",1381968000,,276,3.807017543859649
3005695,5,B000XSKDH4,"I grew up watching this as a viewing partner with mom, and just kind of fell in love with it for a whole different set of reasons.  The movie is great and I would actually recommend it to anyone.  It is long so make sure there is plenty of chips and soda.  You will not be disappointed especially if you like the older classics and a little good dialogue and acting rather than all the contemporary effects ridden movies.",1380672000,,421,4.30379746835443
3005696,5,B000XSKDH4,"The first 3 discs are great fun...the last one not so much - it's obviously an ""after the fact"" attempt to recapture some of the magic (and profits?) of the early Anne.  But her character changes, in my opinion, and the plot becomes 100%, 0% the funny Anne that you have grown to love.  But as a family we've enjoyed watching every minute of the first 3 discs.",1378425600,,360,4.279411764705882

3005699,5,B000XSKDH4,"Love, Love, LOVE, the original movies. Now that I have a daughter, I get to pass this classic on to her. Weve read the books together, but the movies are so beautiful to watch, the story so endearing, and acting done so well they just come alive. I cant think of Anne without seeing these actors.

3005704,4,B000XSKDH4,"I remember growing up with Anne! I've been reading the books and it just didn't feel right until I watched it again. There are a few spots that the words are mumbled or the picture flashes. But they are so minor I couldn't rate it anything less than a 4. I would recommend this item to anyone and everyone, especially if you have a little girl. Anne Shirley knows how to show the value of imagination! I can't wait to share her with my neices some day.",1374451200,,452,4.206896551724138
3005705,5,B000XSKDH4,"This set of DVDS for Anne of Green Gables is simply great. This story is family-friendly, and quite interesting with the main character Anne, and her adventures and experiences that she goes through. Each DVD is sequential, taking over where the previous DVD left off; but you could watch them out of sequence if you did not have all the DVDS. The acting is very good, as well. A very nice addition to our DVD library.",1374278400,,418,4.5131578947368425

No.  I absolutely despise the most recent Anne - 'The Continuing Story' UGH.  It is SUCH a departure from the beloved others.  Just pretend no one made The Continuing Story. Yuck.

I just love the whole set.  Its the type of movie that you kick back on a Saturday afternoon....phones shut off...and just watch.  The actor is just awesome.  Must I tell you...she was chosen out of 3000 girls for that part.  I think they did a great job of choosing ANNE with an E. :)  Everything about the movie is awesome. :) I am glad I got this set. :)My husband watched it with me and he never seen it and let me tell you....he enjoyed the movies.  :)",1364428800,,609,3.9344262295081966
3005730,3,B000XSKDH4,I love this movie! A favorite of mine since childhood. The reason I only gave it a three is because the copy of this is low quality.

Besides that I really enjoyed watching them.,1364342400,,343,4.134328358208955
3005731,5,B000XSKDH4,This is such a great set of dvds.  My friends and I meet on Fridays and share a meal and then watch them.  They bring their children...even the boys became interested and they usually go more for the rough and tumble type films or cartoons.  It gives such an accurate view of what life was like during that time.,1364169600,,312,4.254237288135593
3005732,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love these movies. They are humorous with a touch of romance.  The last one is more of a drama, but I think it may be my favorite one of all of them because it is all about how she follows her husband to war trying to find him because he went missing in action.",1363996800,,263,3.7818181818181817

But I love the bonus features and interviews with the characters when they were younger. And I didn't realize that they made a whole TV series based on Avonlea (sans the main characters), which was nice to find out.

Something that's weird is when this used to be on VHS, it used to be ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea."" But in this DVD series, they call it ""Anne of Green Gables Part 1"" and ""Part 2,"" which I thought was totally unnecessary, but whatever. I will always love Anne and her shenanigans.",1363046400,,703,4.449612403100775

3005736,4,B000XSKDH4,"It appears that some of the previous reviews of the Anne of Green Gables dvd has been applied to more than 1 dvd version for sale here on Amazon. Of the many differet dvds available, prices vary from $15 on up to over $100. The difference is in the run time. The less expensive discs are shorter (250 minutes total), and the more expensive ones go on up to 800 minutes - for what I believe would be the complete tv series. If you are looking for the full tv series, then you need to buy a more expensive set.

I purchased the 5-disc Collector's Set of 612 minutes. The discs show a copyright year of 2006. At the time I purchased it (2013), I thought I was getting the full tv series from the 80s. I'm not positive the full series is what you get in this 5 Disc Collector's Set though. It might be, but it feels shorter to me for some reason. (but please note: I have not watched the full box set yet, just 1/2 of disc 1). I will say that if it's not the full series: it's darn close!

1) The disc quality is amazing. I have a 42"" flat screen tv and the image quality is flawless.

2) You may like or dislike this: although each disc has built-in chapters when you view the disc menu, there is not a designated time duration for each chapter. You can't select ""chapter 2"" and expect it to run like the ""2nd tv episode"" and then stop. Instead, all the chapters are blended together, just like a full length movie would be. If it is your goal to watch it in episode lengths with your kids, you my want to keep track of what you just watched so that you can start up on the right chapter for your next movie night. Chapters are around 7 minutes long (for the first disc).

As a side note, I read another review somewhere that said Morilla's death episode was omitted from one of these disc sets. I will be really ticked off if it is omittd from my set.  But seing how I've only watched 1/2 of the first disc so far, I can't say if it has been omitted or not. I WILL say that it is oddly not listed in any of the chapter headings on any of the discs...which makes me worry that this set is not the real, full, tv series version I had originally hoped.

The 5th disc is bonus features, and I'm glad to report that they did not count the 5th disc as part of the 612 minutes.",1362441600,82,2268,4.062639821029083
3005737,5,B000XSKDH4,This series is a classic and I am so glad to own all the stories from Anne's beginning at Green Gables to after she is married.  Wonderful characters and story line.  I love having it on DVD since VHS players are getting harder to buy.,1362268800,,235,4.2
3005738,5,B000XSKDH4,I bought this Collector's Edition for my daughter for a Christmas present.  We used to watch ALL of the Anne of Green Gables movies together.  My daughter LOVED IT.,1362182400,,164,4.620689655172414

3005741,4,B000XSKDH4,I felt Anne of green gables followed pretty close to the book. Also Megan did a great job bringing her to the screen.,1360454400,,117,4.130434782608695

3005743,5,B000XSKDH4,"My grandmother introduced me to Anne as a little girl, and I remember being completely lost in PEI for hours at a time as we read the entire series together. When I saw the movie for the first time, I could never picture Anne as anyone other than the endearing Megan Follows. This boxed DVD set comes with a fantastic book insert, bonus features, and all three volumes of the Anne movies. When I came across the first movie on TV some 20 years later, it rekindled my appreciation for the series, and I had to add it to my video collection. Even though she now has Alzheimer's, my grandmother still remembers Anne, and I enjoyed showing her the memory book that accompanied the videos because she could still appreciate it.",1359417600,,722,4.519083969465649
3005744,5,B000XSKDH4,"I purchased this on behalf of my disabled son who greatly enjoys literature and comparing the original works with movie and/or theatre productions.  He has listened to unabridged audio versions of most of the ""Anne"" books.  He totally enjoyed this entire DVD series.  ""Green Gables"" and ""Avonlea"" are composites of several of the books.  Many side stories and characters within those books are not present in the movies, and the main characters are developed somewhat differently, particularly the timing of the unfolding of the relationship between Anne & Gilbert.  My son's opinion is that Sullivan's rendition is well done, even though it is in many ways different from the books.  The characters are heart-warming and well developed.  The scenery and costuming is superb.  As a fan of historical fiction, my son found ""The Continuing Story"" to be consistent with other material he has read about WWI, though Montgomery did not continue the characters into that time period. The devotion of Anne & Gilbert to each other was commendable and the progression of the lives of Diana & Fred were interesting.  If you're not an ""Anne"" purist, this is a highly enjoyable, well done video story.",1359072000,3,1189,5.056410256410256

3005751,5,B000XSKDH4,"These movies are some of my absolute favorites and I think everyone needs to see them at least once.  They are appropriate for the young and the old and have an amazing love story.  A lot of people don't like the last movie because it didn't follow the books, and while it didn't follow the books I still love the movie mainly because we get to see Anne and Gilbert again and I love that in the end they adopt a child which they never do in the books.",1356134400,,451,4.056179775280899
3005752,5,B000XSKDH4,"This is one of the most charming and entertaining series for everybody, young or old, male or female.  One does not have to be careful about who will see it: the language, the plots and subplots are delightful as is the character of Anne Shirley.  Would that there were more truly family entertainment such as this one.  Megan Follows is an exceptional actress who enchants viewers -- at least she did me.  I really love watching these dvds  I've seen them more than once and will repeat the enjoyment from time to time with family and friends. Besides buying the collection for myself, I have recommended that a friend purchase it to give as gift.",1355788800,,648,4.6

I was young, though, and was wondering if the re-watch wasn't going to be lame.

It was NOT. Anne is everything I remembered and more. I highly recommend this series both for those who have and have not seen it before. A great, pure, uplifting, neat watch.",1348358400,,386,4.347222222222222

3005769,4,B000XSKDH4,"Not sure how but they got a super performance out of this girl.  She really communicated how it must feel to be an orphan and always a fish out of water, wherever she goes.  The adoptive parents she wound up with turned out to be just what she needed.  She reminds me of the heroine in Jane Eyre...always speaking the truth, not able to take the easy way out of any situation and smart enough to make decent decisions, most of the time.  Things seem to have gone awfully easy for her once she lands with the PIE brother and sister farming couple but the story lets her maintain her connection with the farm and the community she grew to love.  Watch this one several times, it's always a good trip.",1342137600,,698,4.297709923664122

There were times when we stopped for a rest break, and we were hardly able to stop watching the movie. The collection has 5 videos.  One of them has highlights about the author of the book, the director, and all the actors and actresses you will fall in love with while watching the movie.  We watched this on our drive to Canada which made the movie even more special (the bok's setting is in Canada).  You will not regret this purchase and will watch this movie over and over again.

Once I opened it I couldn't believe how cheaply it was packaged.  I didn't even bother watching
them once it was determined one of the DVD's was all scratched up as it was NOT secure in the DVD case.
You couldn't tell which side was what,there were no pics on DVD's just plain.  Sadly I decided
to return the DVDs and look elsewhere.  These DVD's were expensive & I waited a long time to
own these for my grandchildren...Not happy!",1332720000,,521,4.40625

3005781,5,B000XSKDH4,"I am also a fan of action and adventure movies, ride dirt bikes, and surf. I also LOVE this story! It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It captures the essence of wonder and emotion of the European spirit, it tugs deeply at my heart strings, and allows me to escape into an idyllic world of love and feeling. I want to live in this world, and am completely in love with these characters. It is the type of movie that renews your faith in life and the future -- totally uplifiting. This is a magic story.

3005786,4,B000XSKDH4,"This series comes in a beautiful collection box.  The quality of the DVD's is great.  The only reason I did not rate this with 5 stars is because Disc. #2 is missing a beloved scene from the movie.  It is where Anne turns down Gilbert's proposal of engagement.  I did write to the Sullivan Entertainment Company, but never heard back from them.  I really would appreciate having a DVD with this scene included on it.",1326844800,5,416,4.493333333333333

While the transfer is not the ""best"", this set is still magical & will surely awaken the child in you,  put a smile on your face & remind you that kindred spirits do in fact exist.",1326844800,,478,4.359550561797753
3005788,5,B000XSKDH4,"We are in the process of replacing our old VHS tapes with DVDs so I purchased the Sullivan Entertainment Anne Of Green Gables 5 Disc Collectors Edition DVD boxed set from Amazon with the hopes that it was closed captioned. The Amazon description does not give this information, but the Sullivan website does state that this is fully closed captioned. This is correct and it is fully closed captioned. I had to be creative with my TVs and DVD players to get the closed captioning to work. There is no option on the DVD itself to turn on the closed captioning. I first tried it on my kitchen small new ( last summer) flatscreen TV with a built in DVD player. My closed captioning is always turned on on the TV, but to turn on the closed captioning for the movie I had to press the closed caption button on the remote. My second trial was on a 15 year old TV to which I have attached a small external DVD player that I purchased last summer. This time I had to press the closed caption button on the TV remote and it worked. My third trial failed on a older TV with a built in DVD and VHS player. I connected the small external DVD player to that TV and then the closed captioning worked. I have since tried 2 other TVs with external DVD players and the closed captioning worked.  My only failure has been with our blu ray player. We have tried everything and and the closed captioning isn't avaialble there.
The closed captioning isn't available when watching the movie on my computer.
I use closed captioning on everything so that I don't have to turn the TV up so loud. I am a bit hard of hearing, but my husband isn't.
I submitted a picture of the back of the DVD package to Amazon and it shows that the DVD is closed captioned. Hopefully they will be able to change the product description.",1326844800,6,1792,4.317507418397626

3005792,5,B000XSKDH4,I've loved the Anne of Green Gables movies ever since they first came out and was thrilled to find them here. It's a wonderful addition to my DVD collection! Amazon makes it so easy to purchase things!,1323216000,,201,4.45945945945946
3005793,5,B000XSKDH4,"This is one of those beautifully done stories that can take you away from your day to day life and entertain you as well as remind you of what is truly important in life.  The actors are terrific, the scenery is breathtakking and the main character is fun to watch grow from an orphan to a caring mother.  I would recommend this series to any family or individual looking for meaningful entertainment without any embarrasing moments.",1323216000,,433,4.684210526315789
3005794,4,B000XSKDH4,Always loved the books and I was after a few glimpses of this series on YouTube very anxious to have the DVD set: I was not disappointed! Haven't seen the last 2 DVD's yet but my hubby(even this is a 'woman's series according to him he really enjoyed it: I asked him to read the first book before watching )and me loved the first 3 DVD's : the characters jump from the screen and I love Colleen as Anne! I think the casting of all the characters is very well done: just like I imagined them while reading the books. The landscapes are beautiful and the costuming splendid! I am curious what the last DVD will be since the director has changed her adult life quite a bit and I would have liked it seen filmed like the book but I keep an open mind until I have seen it.,1322352000,,767,4.12
3005795,5,B000XSKDH4,Having recently visited Anne of Green Gables on Prince Edward Island it is fun to keep those memories current with this delightful saga. Actors in the series are the best.,1322179200,,171,4.733333333333333
3005796,5,B000XSKDH4,This is a great heart-warming story for all ages.  We all fell in love with Anne as a young orphan.,1321056000,,99,3.95
3005797,4,B000XSKDH4,"I own the original DVD release of these films. I bought them separately and each is a double-sided disc. I recently bought Anne of Green Gables: The Collection to avoid having previews at the beginning and to get a menu with chapters.  Anne of Green Gables: The Collection comes with a beautiful booklet and inserts.  Unfortunately, because each film is on one side of a disc, the quality suffers: digital artifacts are noticeable.  Does anyone know if Anne of  Green Gables: the 4-Part Collection is high-quality with chapters?",1320969600,,528,4.965909090909091
3005798,5,B000XSKDH4,"My mother and I spent many special moments reading the Anne of Green Gables books together, and watching these movies helped us relive those times.  We laughed and cried all over again, and we still enjoy watching them together.

The casting was perfect.  Anne, Gilbert, Diana, Marilla, and Rachel were exactly as I had pictured them!  In fact, the actresses who played Marilla and Rachel went on to play their respective characters in the television show Avonlea that was based off of Lucy Maud Montgomery's books.

The third movie takes place when Gilbert is off at war.  For lovers of the books, just be aware that this was a storyline created entirely by the makers of the movie.  It's not a Lucy Maud Montgomery creation at all, and there is no book or story relating to this plot at all.  However, it was an enjoyable addition to the collection, even though it was my least favorite of the three.

This is a great set of movies for young girls... and for grown women who are still young girls at heart. :)",1320883200,2,1011,4.541436464088398

3005802,5,B000XSKDH4,"I have been looking forward to this collection on DVD ever since I finished reading the book series.  It did not disappoint. The characters of Anne and Gilbert were so engaging.  The humor and fun spread throughout the stories helps the viewer get through the sad times like when Anne loses her beloved caregiver Matthew Cuthbert.  As Anne grows up, goes away to school, finally admits her love for Gilbert and then has to endure his departure to war, she always has with her, the love of the Cuthberts and the strength it has given her to hold on and move forward in good times and in bad.
Anne of Green Gables is full of good values, moral judgment and clean fun.  It is truly a family classic.",1316563200,,696,4.4140625

3005810,5,B000XSKDH4,I first fell in love with this Anne of Green Gables production while visiting my grandmother in Northern Idaho more than 20 years ago.  They lived deep in the woods but did receive two or three television stations.  She recorded these from PBS in the late 1980's and we would watch and re-watch them every summer.  I have been looking forward to sharing these with my daughter and am thrilled to finally be able to do so.  I highly recommend this set.,1311033600,,451,4.463414634146342
3005811,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love these flicks. I was all of eight when I saw the first film on PBS way back in 1985 (good lord, was that really over 25 years ago?), and this film and its immediate sequel have since remained among my favorites. I am now a thirty-something male, can't claim to know much about farming, have lived in big cities most of my life and have never been to Prince Edward Island, but darn it if I didn't completely identify with these characters and want to run off to live in small-town Canada when I first saw this flick. The primary charms lie in the strength of the writing and the warmth of the central performances (Follows and the late, great actors Dewhurst and Farnsworth are all note-perfect), but the lush scenery is also a factor. At over three hours, I still wanted these picture to run longer. That should tell you something.

*Note: this review refers to the first two of the three ""Anne"" films in the collected set. The less said about that third, the better.",1310169600,,973,4.435754189944134

Seldom have I seen a performance that completely captures the essence of a character as does that of Megan Fellows as Anne. To see her is to see Anne as she unfolds through the pages of Montgomery's charming and insightful novel. This adaptation and performance is simply the best. It has everything one would expect from a great story, filled with charm, humor, sadness, and gladness. While it is filled with stories that touch on all the aspects of human strength and frailness it is a story of love. The pure and innocent love of a young girl who overcomes the difficulties life has dealt her. Beyond that it is a lesson in how one person filled with love and imagination can change the lives of all those she comes in contact with. I guarantee this is one story you and your family will never tire of watching.",1308700800,3,899,4.421686746987952

""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Anne of Avonlea"", and ""Anne the Continuing Story"" are all included in this DVD set which makes it a nice buy!  It's a wonderful story - bound to make you laugh, cry, swoon - a wide collection of emotions.  The actress, Megan Follows - is so extraordinary in this series.  I believe it even includes bonus features of Megan's auditions and scenes they couldn't include in the cut version because of time.  This is a great series to watch with your family - very clean and never boring in my opinion.. it starts off a little slow as it builds the foundation for the series, but if you give it a chance, you will fall in love with it!  By the way, this movie series is nothing like the books, so don't expect it to be - but I can honestly say that this movie is far better than the book, and for most book/movie comparisons I wouldn't say that - this just happens to be the exception.",1301184000,3,1021,4.237113402061856

The first one is full of the Anne-ish tales we all love (""carrots!"", the maiden lily floating into...Gilbert! and many others..) The second is my favorite...no words to describe it. You must see these wonderful DVDs! I highly recommend watching ""Road to Avonlea"" before or after you watch these...those are classics as well and have Marilla, Mrs. Lynde, etc. in them.
The third one, however, is WAY off of the books! If you're a stickly for that sort of thing, don't watch the third one. I, however, still enjoyed the third one.

Eventually I bought the trilogy when it was offered as an Anniversary package.  It's one of those good ole movies that you could watch over and over and each time, pick up something new.  Megan Follows is excellent as Anne, spelled with an ""E"", and I can't imagine anyone topping her performance.  The actors who portray Diana and Gilbert are also top notch.  You also fall in love with Colleen Dewhurst & Richard Farnsworth's performance.  The setting and scenery alone are just breathtaking.  I absolutely LOVE this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age.  Another good series to own is the Road to Avonlea.  Some of the actors from Anne are also in R2A, of course, portraying other characters.  I hope if you decide to purchase either of these dvd sets, you enjoy them as much as I do.",1291161600,,968,4.4375

3005834,4,B000XSKDH4,"I've been an Anne of Green Gables fan since I read the books when I was a little girl, and when I purchased this Anne trilogy and rewatched the first two miniseries, I remembered how much I loved the miniseries and the books when I was little. The first, Anne of Green Gables, is by far the best, and is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I have ever seen. The second, Anne of Avonlea AKA Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel, is also wonderful, a worthy sequel to the first and a lovely adaptation of the next few books in the series. And as for the third, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story... well, it's just bad. Not only does it have nothing whatsoever to do with the books besides names, it's not a good movie even when taken on its own. Other reviewers have already explained its problems, but I'll just touch on the biggest ones.
First off, it is an in-name-only adaptation of the books, so don't expect the storyline to follow the books AT ALL: second, the writing is terribly sloppy, reading more like a bad fanfic than anything else: the plot is unbelievable, chock-full of contrived coincidences (so Anne just *happened* to run into old friends and loved ones not once, not twice, but THREE times while gallivanting about Europe?): and finally, the characters have changed completely, not just from the books, but from the first two movies, as well. I realize that, in-story, years have passed between the second and third movies, but Anne, Gilbert, Diana and the rest all seem to have gone through 180 degree personality changes. And who made the decision to make Anne a klutz who squees like a fangirl every time she sees Gil? I mean, *I* squee like the fangirl I am whenever Gil comes onscreen, but I'm a viewer, I'm supposed to do that! Anne would never behave that way around Gil.
In any case, the first two miniseries are perfectly charming and fantastic, more than making up for the abortion that is The Continuing Story. I highly recommend the Anne trilogy DVD to anyone who loves Anne of Green Gables, period films or just all-around great storytelling. Watch the third at your own risk, however.

3005843,4,B000XSKDH4,"This is a collection of three Anne stories. The trilogy, as a set, has only a Three-Star rating. However, the quality of the three stories varies greatly.

The first, ""Anne of Green Gables"", was written by the author of the popular series, and is outstanding.
All characters are well acted, especially by Megan Follows as Anne Shirley. Likewise, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth deliver memorable performances as Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert. The show successfully deliveries a feeling of the simple life of those times and stirs a love of Prince Edward Island by the viewers. This movie from the CBS/PBS television series will enchant and thrill all fans. This production earns a full FIVE-Star rating.

The second story ""The Sequel"" was written by the Director, Kevin Sullivan, rather than L. M. Montgomery who created the series.
This story indicates that Sullivan is just trying to milk a sequel to his successful Anne of Green Gables series. This tale banters Anne as aloof and disdaining of both Gilbert and another suitor. She intertwines with the wealthy classes when she moves to accept a teaching position with another school. The story sets fairly well though and is enjoyable. However, it has lost most of its charm and innocence, along with Anne's wide-eye enjoyment of nature and people. Fans should still enjoy this story which does maintain the general feel on the characters.
This production earned a FOUR-Star rating.

Finally, the third story ""The Continuing Story"" is a great disappointment.
Once again, it was entirely written by Director Kevin Sullivan and departs greatly from the author's story theme. This is a dark plot revolving around war and espionage.
Reminiscent of ""The Perils of Pauline"" it wallows in misery and suffering during World War I. Apparently Sullivan wanted to recast the original actors in their roles but had to adjust the plot to accommodate the older actors. In doing so, he twists the story and creates a new setting with Gilbert as a soldier in France and Anne blundering from one scene of calamity to another. Except for the character names, there is precious little resemblance of this story to the originals.
This productions in rated only ONE-Star, and actually doesn't deserve that high. I cannot imagine fans who would not feel offended by this cheap imitation.

Please do not pass on this DVD set because of the unsatisfactory third story.
I am glad that I did buy it. I have no regrets about buying it.
I only wish that I had been aware that two were not actually written by the author and that the third was such a dark, non-typical Anne of Green Gables.",1283212800,9,2620,4.920814479638009

3005850,3,B000XSKDH4,"I have always loved the Kevin Sullivan adaptations of the 'Anne of Green Gables' stories.  OK, maybe the first installment the best, as the second and third deviated from the original books more and more, to eventually have little to do with the L.M. Montgomery stories other than the characters.  I believe Megan Follows (who plays Anne) actually had some issues with this.

Why three stars?  Clearly, not so much my rating of the films themselves, but of the DVD quality.  The films should get 5+ stars. However, I purchased this particular DVD set under the impression that, as opposed to the earlier DVD editions, the image had been 'digitally restored,' as the package claims.  Not only was the video quality not any better than previous editions, it still is only slightly better than an VHS copy!  This has been something that has always bothered me deeply, because such gorgeous cinematography coupled with super acting deserves, in my opinion, superior quality digital editions.  To this day, the films never have gotten such treatment.  If they have, they sure do not look like it.  There is really no reason why the video quality should not be better than it is.  Maybe they tried to compress too much into too little space, I don't know.  Some scenes are almost painful to watch (i.e. the scene when Matthew and Anne arrive at Green Gables), because the image quality is quite poor.  I hope that eventually Sullivan Productions releases these films (as well as the 'Road to Avonlea' series, whose DVD releases also lack in video quality) with the quality they (and us) deserve.

So, if you have considered buying this set to replace the earlier editions with the expectation to be wowed by superb digital video restoration, save your money!  If, however, you have not yet bought any Anne films, then by all means, get them. Inferior video quality is surely made up by the beauty of the films.",1279929600,11,1904,4.7975460122699385

Being able to live with the joy of ""imagining"" how puffed sleeves will make her feel, is an amazing description of the ""art of manifestation.""

Anne's ability to ""imagine"" herself out of any negative situation or to ""imagine"" the most beautiful outcome for any everyday occurence is amazing.

I would recommend that everyone who reads this book, try that ""imagination technique"" especially if they are finding blockages in their life in abundance or happiness.

I went into a project where I was hoping to make some money but doubting my ability to do this.  I read Anne of Green Gables JUST BEFORE leaving home and I ""Imagined"" myself ending the day with my money box full.  It was and all my expenses were paid whereas others around me were complaining that the day was slow and they made very little money.  I kept that ""joyful"" feeling with me all day which had me smiling all day.  I think I was also imagining I was wearing puffed sleeves, which I love.

There are plenty of strong men in the series, and wonderful actors, but these fine interesting relationships make this a top notch film in many respects.  The photography was very simply gorgeous.

1. Anne of Green Gables is one of the best novels ever written and the mini-series is presented very well and is accurate to the book. It is an outstanding rendition. The release of this set is nicely timed with the 100th anniversary of the novel.

2. I like the first sequel even though they made changes, mostly because they were faithful to the flavour of the novel and kept most people & characters the same as they were in the books. This movie is semi-loosely based on Anne of the Island and Anne of Windy Poplars. However, I do miss Roy Gardner!

3. I do not care for the 2nd sequel because I feel they went too far from the words that made Montgomery famous. I would have preferred if they had presented Anne's House of Dreams which is one of LMM's best books. Instead they borrowed ideas from Rilla of Ingleside and made Gilbert (and Anne) go off to war. They did not present A & G's wedding well at all and I was disappointed. Jon Crombie's characterization of Gilbert was very altered. In the books Gilbert was always the jokester and ""teasy"" even when he was older. I didn't know the thin and serious Gilbert presented in this mini-series.

To be honest, the producers made a good decision cutting the scenes out. They were nothing like I had anticipated and detracted from the story but I was happy to be able to finally watch them. I also, enjoyed the commentaries, which were added to the set.

I paid $84. for Anne of Green Gables: The Collection and to be honest, I think it was over priced. I ordered it expecting each movie to be on one DVD, with two bonus disc. However, the Sequel had been split among two DVD's; leaving only one DVD for commentaries and additional footage.

Anne of Green Gables is one of my all-time favorite movies and I'm most happy to have to Anne of Green Gables: The Collection at just about any price. (After all the original set of 6-VHS tapes cost just under $100. So, for Anne lovers, this is so special. I'm ordering one for my mother too.

3005885,5,B000XSKDH4,"Before I purchased this set I spent some time on the Internet looking for any kind of review for this item, to see whether or not, since I already owned the individual remastered special editions, this was worth the upgrade.

But, there was nothing.

So I took the plunge (it helped that the Costco here in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, had the set on sale for $47.99 Canadian, cheaper then even the official site was selling it for) and now, here's what you need to know.

First off, the video presentation of the films is the exact same as the individual remastered special edition DVD from years back.

Meaning it's watchable, but not the best picture quality out there.

One of the reasons for this is that the first two mini series where filmed on 16mm film stock, thus creating a slightly grainy picture.

I had hoped that since the extras on the discs where transported onto the fifth disc, that the freed up space would have allowed for better compression, and thus, better picture quality, but that is not the case.

Okay, so lets list the pros and cons of this set:

Pros:

* All the discs are single sided (not double sided like the second and third mini series DVD's in the individual sets)
* There's a nice hour plus making of retrospective with Kevin Sullivan and some of the cast members
* A nice booklet with production notes and pictures, comes with the set
* The price is less than the collective price of purchasing the three mini series DVD's individually

Cons:

* The picture hasn't been improved
* Other than the retrospective documentary, a ten minute fluff piece on the author, and the missing Morilla's Death episode (which I have yet to watch, so I can't comment on it at the present) everything else is the same as the last incarnations of the DVD's

Of note, all of the extras from the previous DVD's have been carried over including Megan Follows screen test, and are all on the fifth disc.

So if you don't already own the individual special edition DVD's, then this set is the way to go, and if you already own the individual DVD's and want more extras, then this new set is worth the upgrade, otherwise this set can be skipped.

Hope this helps.",1210636800,"1,100",2178,4.537084398976982

3239901,5,B000XSKDH4,"This contains the three CBC/Disney Channel/PBS co-produced mini-series based on the Lucy Maud Montgomenry books starring Megan Follows as the complex Anne Shirley.

The first Anne of Green Gables begins the story of Anne Shirley, she is an orphan with her head in the clouds and usually a book.  Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert ask for a foster child to help out at their farm.  Instead of the boy they expected, Anne Shirley arrives.  They agree to keep her for the time being but Anne's head in the cloud constantly gets her in trouble.  But what Marilla sees in Anne is herself and Matthew loves her spunk.  Anne proves that she is quite intelligent and excells at the local school.  Diana Berry becomes her best bossom buddy for life.  While Gilbert Blythe becomes her love interest but she is not speaking to him because of his continual kidding.  Anne trains to become a province teacher but decides to give it up when Matthew sudenly dies.

This introduced us to the incredible Megan Follows who shined in as Anne.  It also gave great roles to two American treasures, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth.

In Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel (a.k.a. Anne of Avonlea), Anne's adventures in Avonlea continue.  Anne wants to be a writer but everything submitted is rejected.  That is until life long bossom buddy Diana Berry submits it to a writng competition and it wins.  Anne gets a posting in Kingsport at an exclusive girls school.  But she finds out that the Pringles run this town and she took the place of one of their clan.  She spends the rest of the movie converting everyone over.  On the romance side, Diana gets married but Anne rejects Gilbert's proposal.

Once again, Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst give great performances and are joined by the great Wendy Hiller as the head of the Pringle clan (although she really can't stand her relatives.)

Part 3 is Anne of Green Gables: The Story Continues.  Anne is continuing her ambitions as a writer and her love for Gilbert Blythe.  But WWI breaks out and Gilbert enlists.  When Gilbert goes missing it's upto Anne to find him. (By the way this is not based on a LMM book but fans wanted closure, so the producers made this final episode!)

This is a much more serious episode but Megan Follows shows you she is up to it.

This new set has all three mini-series plus two documentaries and a lost mini - episode.

If you want a DVD set that is good for the whole family.  It is well written and directed.  While it comes from books that are for children, the series is just told from a young girl's point of view but the film makers give it an adult treatment.",1200960000,10,2630,4.585836909871245
3239902,5,B000XSKDH4,"Anne of Green Gables The Collection
This DVD collection consists of all three Anne movies - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Green Gables -The Sequel and Anne of Green Gables -The Continuing Story. There are audio commentaries on each of the discs as well as additional bonus features such as additional footage, deleted scenes, the missing episode ""Marilla Cuthbert's Death"", and two new documentaries ""L.M. Montgomery Island"" and  ""Kevin Sullivan's Classic"", as well as a featurette on WWI , a historical commentary by Kevin Sullivan. Here's a brief review of each of the Anne movies:
Anne of Green Gables
I loved reading the Anne of Green Gables stories when I was a teenager, and then I discovered the DVDs as an adult, and found that Anne's story will always be a treasured classic, one that I can watch over & over again. The story of the orphan Anne who is taken in by two siblings, Matthew & Marilla Cuthbert is so appealing for all the characters are people we can relate to & love. Anne is a fiery, wilful redhead, played excellently by Megan Fellows. She is ambitious, hot-tempered, and yet possesses a vulnerability that makes her so lovable. Richard Farnsworth is amazing as the soft-spoken Matthew Cuthbert who loves Anne unconditionally, and Colleen Dewhurst plays Marilla Cuthbert, an aging spinster, who seems like a curmudgeon, but is really a softie when it comes to Anne...the stories of Anne's adventures will make your heart sing, and yearn for more innocent times, when kids played with a carefree spirit, and no worries...when imagination was put to good use, and the great outdoors were a main source of entertainment.
Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel
Contrary to some reviews, I truly enjoyed this DVD. Megan Fellowes reprises her role as Anne Shirley, who embarks on an adventure when she takes up a teaching position at Kingsport Ladies College, finding challenges & romance along the way...but as always, Anne finds her way back to Avonlea. I won't give too much away here, but suffice to say that this DVD is worth watching[ despite being very loosely adapted from the books] if only because all the characters are played so well by the actors/actresses. Megan Fellowes performance is truly a joy to watch, she is an amazing actress with a great range of emotions, and the story flows smoothly, with humor, heartache, and romance. What more could one ask for?
Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story
This was the worst in the Anne series and is only worth watching for Megan Fellowes' performance. As always, she does an amazing job as Anne, and in fact I could never imagine any other actress doing justice to Anne's character! Back to the DVD, I felt that the writers did a poor job of continuing Anne & Gilbert's story...they got them married off in a jiffy [when so many fans were eagerly anticipating a nice, long-drawn fairytale wedding], and then after a brief stint in NY, Gilbert enlists in WW I! So, Anne of course has to go find him when he is reported missing, and the adventures she encounters along the way make up the rest of the story. This sequel is definitely the weakest in the DVD trilogy, but nevertheless a worthwhile watch, if only to see Anne again, and if you yearn for the Anne of before...then I suggest watching the earlier two DVDs which are far superior in production and acting to this one.
CONCLUSION - I'd only recommend purchasing this DVD set if you don't already own the individual DVDs and are keen to view the new documentaries. Actually, it might help to shop around as I've seen this DVD set retailing at much less at other places. Also, there's a new Kevin Sullivan production of Anne titled ""Anne of Green Gables - a New Beginning, which purports to trace Anne's life before she came to live with the Cuthberts, but which apparently is not based on the LM Montgomery books.  I'm not sure as to when this DVD is being released, but some fans might want to wait till all four Anne movies are released in one complete set.",1174176000,8,3993,4.686609686609686

3239935,5,B000XSKDH4,"I have the Anne of Green Gables (whole set) in VHS. I so wanted to get the collection with Megan Follows in a more ""permanent"" format. I've only begun watching the first disc. It's a little difficult as it's not made for the new TV's (the excellent condition worked perfectly 1980's RCA TV was destroyed in the tornado much to my dismay and other's happiness) and I'm trying to figure out how to make it quite fit. In regular mode, I lose top and bottom and the video is pretty grainy. This new TV doesn't come with a setup to fix this issue (or I can't find it) so I'm having to make do with my old DVD player remote by using the zoom feature and making it 1/2 screen. That works perfectly for me - it has black on either side but sits very well in the center. Color is great, sound is great. There have been a couple of ""wobbles"" (like the film sort of dragged and then jumped forward to place about one or two seconds) -  enough for me to see it and wonder, but not enough to mess with the vision or the current film. I'm enjoying it and glad that I purchased it.  The newer Anne in the updated versions just does not have the winsomeness, wittiness, and acting ability as Megan Follows (in my opinion).",1508803200,,1206,4.193965517241379

Some of them were already popped out of their insert when I opened the case. The first two disks worked fine, the other three-- not at all. I even tried different dvd players.  I'm so disappointed because this is the SECOND box set I have ordered from Sullivan Entertainment, and the EXACT problem happened with that edition as well.

Then I saw this version and jumped at it. I didn't see until after my order was on its way that there some negative reviews of this edition, citing disc errors and glitches. However, seeing as these reviews were several years old, and recent reviews didn't mention any problems, I thought I'd give them a chance when they arrived. I'm glad I did! All the discs work perfectly, and I'm very satisfied with the video quality! It may not be quite up to the standards we normally expect for DVD, but it's still a great deal better than the VHS copies I had!

All in all, I'm very satisfied, and given that following the older reviews of this edition, the problems with the discs must have been corrected, I would definitely say that this is a collection worth your time and money!",1488585600,20,966,4.545977011494253

3240145,5,B000XSKDH4,I enjoyed this series and liked the beautiful scenery of the different shots on location of PEI and the various farm scenes outside of Toronto.  The story of the early 1900's is very will done.  The Anne character shows the importance of a good self respect image that an individual needs to succeed in society.  We need more movies of this same quality today.  Please note that the origin filming was done in 16 mm and was later upgraded to digital on the first 2 discs. I also enjoyed the interviews with the actors.  They were all in agreement that the series had to be made and enjoyed the making of the story into the film and later video.,1403222400,5,644,4.378151260504202

It is nothing like the book....it isn't even remotely close to the story.  It is a crazy war movie with seduction and murder!!  Not things I think of when I think of Annes treasured Prince Edward Island paradise.  Other that the 3rd movie I was very happy with this set and highly reccomend it.

3240169,5,B000XSKDH4,"This set of movies has been a family tradition for over twenty years. The movie has ""depth"" in its story and the scenery is beautiful. The set is a series, therefore it's best to watch them in order. It's the story of Anne, an orphan girl who is adopted by mistake as the caregivers had ordered a ""boy"" to help out.  Anne begs to prove herself worthy of being kept. She tries really hard to be ""good"", but always seems to find herself in some type of innocent mishap of one kind or another.  Anne quickly wins herway into the caregiver's hearts (and the viewer's hearts as well).  The 2nd movie picks up with her friends getting married, her own college desires and ""love"".  These two are truly heartwarming.  The third movie starts with her marriage, then her husband and other friends being shipped off to war. She can't handle the separation and joins the war movement herself in hopes of finding and serving with her beloved. This one obviously has a heavier tone to it, but is still worth seeing.  Megan Follows was the perfect pick for the starring role.  Everyone was perfectly cast, and really no one stands out above any of the others.  In our family's oppinion it just a PERFECT movie..can't think of even one negative point.  If I could only own one family movie - this would be it!",1390694400,,1293,4.4914529914529915

3240173,5,B000XSKDH4,"This series is based on the popular books and it doesn't disappoint. The video quality is okay but that is to be expected because nowadays with HD everything seems not perfect. It follows the life of orphan Anne Shirley. It is ultimately a love story. If you have read the book you will notice certain discrepancies but I guess they took some liberties to make the series more exciting towards the end. I doesn't matter you'll love the characters and their stories anyway. I mean, who doesn't love Gilbert Blythe?",1390089600,,513,4.711111111111111
3240174,5,B000XSKDH4,"I was first introduced to movies 1 & 2 when I was a late teen (over a decade ago), during one of the PBS telethons.  I had not read the books before, so I had nothing to compare them to (perhaps that's a good thing).

For me, the acting is top notch, the storyline uplifting, scenery/locations breathtaking, and the score *particularly the theme* enthralling (although not included on the soundtrack, the piano rendition by Jonathon Lee is amazing)!
I can't believe it's taken me this long to add to my collection.

In November I was able to finally purchase the book set, and have since eagerly devoured books 1-8.
I highly recommend any fan of the movie series to do this; there's so much depth to the story than is portrayed on screen!

I will say that I'm a tad disappointed now in regards to the 2nd movie, being it contains very little of the events and characters of book 2,  and basically skipped all of book 3 (which chronicles Anne & Gilbert's 4 college years at Redmond).
Too, we see the formation of new characters; combining 2 or 3 originals into one.  For example, Morgan Harris = Roy Gardner (book 3), and Mr. Grayson (book 4); Emmeline Harris = Sophie Sinclaire, & Elizabeth Grayson (book 4) ; Margaret Harris =  Miss Sarah Pringle, Mrs. Campbell, &  Mrs. Adoniram Gibson (book 4);  Pauline Harris = Pauline Gibson (book 4).
I suppose it had to be done to accommodate the merging of books 2-4 into one cohesive story.  But I would have preferred that the movies stayed closer to the books.  Really, it would have been better to leave out book 4, and focus on books 2, 3, & 5  for the second movie, and 6-8 for the third.

I haven't seen the 3'd movie in years; but have plans as soon as I finish pt. 2 of the second movie.
 Unfortunately, it really doesn't follow any of LMM's book series at all (aside from one event).
The books were set in the late Victorian era (1876- onward; for in-depth info on each books timeline, etc. go here: anneofgreengables.wikia(DOT)com/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_Wiki ), whereas the movies are set in the mid to late Edwardian period.
The last book in the ""Anne"" set- ""Rilla of Ingleside""- takes place during WW1, but is centered around her oldest children.
The only semi-consolation is, at least Megan (Anne), and Jonathan (Gilbert) reprise their roles, and gives fans a little closure for their characters romantic storyline; along with some deleted scenes.
_______
I chose to go with the ""Collector's Edition"", being my research has lead me to believe the ""Restoration"" is not much of an improvement-- at least for the money; and the 4th movie sounds like a downright abomination!
**You might want to check out this site for a comprehensive comparison of some of the releases (namely the ""Restored/Restoration"" vs. ""Collector's (Anniversary)"" edition**:

________
In conclusion, I highly recommend this series for those that enjoy period drama, or are looking for something suitable for family viewing (at least 1 & 2)!  I feel this trilogy series really brings to life the essence of this beloved book series, and for that- despite some major changes- I'll still give it 5 stars!

 Other film adaptations like it: ""Christy"" (short lived TV series 1994/95) based on Catherine Marshall's novel.  And a brand new television series by the Hallmark channel entitled ""When Calls the Heart"", based on Janette Oke's ""Canadian West"" book series.

**Side note, there is an interesting interview here with Kevin Sullivan about the movies, and some reasons of his for writing them the way he did:  avonlea.hu/guide/interviews/kevin_sullivan
As mentioned in that interview, there was a lawsuit between him and LMM's heirs, so perhaps that had a bearing on the storyline of the 3'd movie?  Perhaps this is also why nobody else has attempted to make another adaptation? ...I for one would be interested in seeing another interpretation more true to the books, but I have doubts that it will ever happen.**",1390003200,9,4134,5.0768094534711965
3240175,2,B000XSKDH4,"This is beautiful, enchanting, charming, amusing,  but...so wrong. I read all the books in the Anne of Green Gables series. I know the stories too well, I suppose, because all the differences became annoying. Numerous large and small matters were changed.

---------- SPOILERS BELOW -----------

HOW THESE DVDs DIFFERED FROM THE BOOKS:

Matthew Cuthbert's death, Anne and Gilbert's wedding, Diane Barry never became rich -- that was Jane.  Anne almost married the wrong man -- but it wasn't the guy portrayed in this film -- she almost married a rich guy she met in college. After Matthew died, Anne and Marilla helped to bring up two orphaned children in the books (Davy and Dora, if memory serves) but they were left out of the series.

As for the continuing story, the house at Green Gables was never vandalised, and Anne and Gilbert never lived there. Furthermore, Gilbert never went to war -- that was the next generation, Anne and Gilbert's sons went to war, as depicted in Rilla of Ingelside. All the scene involving the Germans and the secret spy guy are totally invented.

Why not stick to the books? There was plenty of material.

Also, the TV series did not portray Marilla correctly -- did not show her developing love for the unexpected orphan. For example, in book 1 Anne broke her leg falling off the roof and became unconscious. When Mr. Barry carried her home, Marrilla thought she might be dead and realized how much Anne had come to mean to her.  However, in the movie, Anne did not break a leg, she only twisted an ankle, but even worse, Marilla did not almost start to cry.",1389830400,,1594,4.684587813620071

3240177,4,B000XSKDH4,"It is soooooo nice to have this 5 disc collection of a really poignant coming of age story of Anne Shirley, a bright yet fiery redhead.  The film is exactly as I remember it.  The DVDs are nicely displayed in a fold-out case.  The only thing that loses a star is the video quality--it is nowhere near today's HD standards as it is a bit grainy.  I do feel it is well worth the purchase as the story is wonderful and brings back a lot of really cool memories of my family watching this together many years ago.",1388793600,,509,4.163265306122449

3240182,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love the Anne of Green Gables films. If I didn't have a problem with the product itself, this review would be having 5 stars. These movies are rather long. I recently was finally able to sit down and watch the last portion of this DVD set, and I sadly came across a scene that glitched out - blue and green blanked out screen. This was purchased over the summer, so it is out of the 30 day window, so I am not sure if there is anything I can do about it now.

I love these movies and am just really disappointed that this DVD set holds digital glitches.

::UPDATED REVIEW::

I ended up contacting Amazon to explain what had happened with this order of mine. They were very gracious and offered to exchange my defective set for a new one that's hopefully not defective! That being said, this gets a 5 star review now due to this help that I received and so far, no glitches, but I do have more of the set to go through yet!",1387584000,,924,4.122222222222222

Good ""mechanics"" - we found only 1 skip in the entire series.  Bonus features are a real plus - the producer's great care in selection of scenery, selection of actors/actresses (Canadians were selected above more famous U.S. counterparts to preserve the Canadian heritage of the original book, for instance), bonus features, and explanation of historical background and cultural details to tie the movie into the original book and TV mini-series were all very nice touches.

A realistic view of life in the years leading up to World War One.  No foul language whatsoever.  Amazing how this production company could round up the same people some fifteen years later for the sequel.  The people look older in the sequel because they are older. Marriage is honored in this movie, as God intended it to be.  Nice to see women wearing women's clothing instead of men's clothing.",1382572800,,510,4.804597701149425

There are a few spots that the words are mumbled or the picture flashes. But they are so minor I couldn't rate it anything less than a 4. I would recommend this item to anyone and everyone, especially if you have a little girl. Anne Shirley knows how to show the value of imagination!

I just love the whole set.  Its the type of movie that you kick back on a Saturday afternoon....phones shut off...and just watch.  The actor is just awesome.  Must I tell you...she was chosen out of 3000 girls for that part.  I think they did a great job of choosing ANNE with an E. :)  Everything about the movie is awesome. :) I am glad I got this set. :)My husband watched it with me and he never seen it and let me tell you....he enjoyed the movies.  :)",1364428800,,609,3.9344262295081966
3240227,3,B000XSKDH4,I love this movie! A favorite of mine since childhood. The reason I only gave it a three is because the copy of this is low quality. Some parts of the movie look grainy and there was one section of the movie that was skipping. This was my first time viewing the movie so no way that I scratched it. Besides that I really enjoyed watching them.,1364342400,,343,4.134328358208955
3240228,5,B000XSKDH4,This is such a great set of dvds.  My friends and I meet on Fridays and share a meal and then watch them.  They bring their children...even the boys became interested and they usually go more for the rough and tumble type films or cartoons.  It gives such an accurate view of what life was like during that time.,1364169600,,312,4.254237288135593
3240229,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love these movies. They are humorous with a touch of romance.

But I love the bonus features and interviews with the characters when they were younger. And I didn't realize that they made a whole TV series based on Avonlea (sans the main characters), which was nice to find out.

Something that's weird is when this used to be on VHS, it used to be ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea."" But in this DVD series, they call it ""Anne of Green Gables Part 1"" and ""Part 2,"" which I thought was totally unnecessary, but whatever. I will always love Anne and her shenanigans.",1363046400,,703,4.449612403100775

3240233,4,B000XSKDH4,"It appears that some of the previous reviews of the Anne of Green Gables dvd has been applied to more than 1 dvd version for sale here on Amazon. Of the many differet dvds available, prices vary from $15 on up to over $100. The difference is in the run time. The less expensive discs are shorter (250 minutes total), and the more expensive ones go on up to 800 minutes - for what I believe would be the complete tv series. If you are looking for the full tv series, then you need to buy a more expensive set.

I purchased the 5-disc Collector's Set of 612 minutes. The discs show a copyright year of 2006. At the time I purchased it (2013), I thought I was getting the full tv series from the 80s. I'm not positive the full series is what you get in this 5 Disc Collector's Set though. It might be, but it feels shorter to me for some reason. (but please note: I have not watched the full box set yet, just 1/2 of disc 1). I will say that if it's not the full series: it's darn close!

1) The disc quality is amazing. I have a 42"" flat screen tv and the image quality is flawless.

2) You may like or dislike this: although each disc has built-in chapters when you view the disc menu, there is not a designated time duration for each chapter. You can't select ""chapter 2"" and expect it to run like the ""2nd tv episode"" and then stop. Instead, all the chapters are blended together, just like a full length movie would be. If it is your goal to watch it in episode lengths with your kids, you my want to keep track of what you just watched so that you can start up on the right chapter for your next movie night. Chapters are around 7 minutes long (for the first disc).

As a side note, I read another review somewhere that said Morilla's death episode was omitted from one of these disc sets. I will be really ticked off if it is omittd from my set.  But seing how I've only watched 1/2 of the first disc so far, I can't say if it has been omitted or not. I WILL say that it is oddly not listed in any of the chapter headings on any of the discs...which makes me worry that this set is not the real, full, tv series version I had originally hoped.

The 5th disc is bonus features, and I'm glad to report that they did not count the 5th disc as part of the 612 minutes.",1362441600,82,2268,4.062639821029083

When I saw the movie for the first time, I could never picture Anne as anyone other than the endearing Megan Follows. This boxed DVD set comes with a fantastic book insert, bonus features, and all three volumes of the Anne movies. When I came across the first movie on TV some 20 years later, it rekindled my appreciation for the series, and I had to add it to my video collection. Even though she now has Alzheimer's, my grandmother still remembers Anne, and I enjoyed showing her the memory book that accompanied the videos because she could still appreciate it.",1359417600,,722,4.519083969465649
3240241,5,B000XSKDH4,"I purchased this on behalf of my disabled son who greatly enjoys literature and comparing the original works with movie and/or theatre productions.  He has listened to unabridged audio versions of most of the ""Anne"" books.  He totally enjoyed this entire DVD series.  ""Green Gables"" and ""Avonlea"" are composites of several of the books.  Many side stories and characters within those books are not present in the movies, and the main characters are developed somewhat differently, particularly the timing of the unfolding of the relationship between Anne & Gilbert.  My son's opinion is that Sullivan's rendition is well done, even though it is in many ways different from the books.  The characters are heart-warming and well developed.  The scenery and costuming is superb.  As a fan of historical fiction, my son found ""The Continuing Story"" to be consistent with other material he has read about WWI, though Montgomery did not continue the characters into that time period. The devotion of Anne & Gilbert to each other was commendable and the progression of the lives of Diana & Fred were interesting.  If you're not an ""Anne"" purist, this is a highly enjoyable, well done video story.",1359072000,3,1189,5.056410256410256

I was young, though, and was wondering if the re-watch wasn't going to be lame.

It was NOT. Anne is everything I remembered and more. I highly recommend this series both for those who have and have not seen it before. A great, pure, uplifting, neat watch.",1348358400,,386,4.347222222222222

3240266,4,B000XSKDH4,"Not sure how but they got a super performance out of this girl.  She really communicated how it must feel to be an orphan and always a fish out of water, wherever she goes.  The adoptive parents she wound up with turned out to be just what she needed.  She reminds me of the heroine in Jane Eyre...always speaking the truth, not able to take the easy way out of any situation and smart enough to make decent decisions, most of the time.  Things seem to have gone awfully easy for her once she lands with the PIE brother and sister farming couple but the story lets her maintain her connection with the farm and the community she grew to love.  Watch this one several times, it's always a good trip.",1342137600,,698,4.297709923664122

There were times when we stopped for a rest break, and we were hardly able to stop watching the movie. The collection has 5 videos.  One of them has highlights about the author of the book, the director, and all the actors and actresses you will fall in love with while watching the movie.  We watched this on our drive to Canada which made the movie even more special (the bok's setting is in Canada).  You will not regret this purchase and will watch this movie over and over again.

Once I opened it I couldn't believe how cheaply it was packaged.  I didn't even bother watching
them once it was determined one of the DVD's was all scratched up as it was NOT secure in the DVD case.
You couldn't tell which side was what,there were no pics on DVD's just plain.  Sadly I decided
to return the DVDs and look elsewhere.  These DVD's were expensive & I waited a long time to
own these for my grandchildren...Not happy!",1332720000,,521,4.40625

It captures the essence of wonder and emotion of the European spirit, it tugs deeply at my heart strings, and allows me to escape into an idyllic world of love and feeling. I want to live in this world, and am completely in love with these characters. It is the type of movie that renews your faith in life and the future -- totally uplifiting. This is a magic story.

The picture quality is really good, much better than when I first watched the movie over 20 years ago. Included all 3 of the Anne of Green Gables films and bonus material. Comes with 5 DVD's, each contains a description of the scenes on the box and the running time.

3240283,4,B000XSKDH4,"This series comes in a beautiful collection box.  The quality of the DVD's is great.  The only reason I did not rate this with 5 stars is because Disc. #2 is missing a beloved scene from the movie.  It is where Anne turns down Gilbert's proposal of engagement.  I did write to the Sullivan Entertainment Company, but never heard back from them.  I really would appreciate having a DVD with this scene included on it.",1326844800,5,416,4.493333333333333

I forgot how funny these movies actually were & I still find myself getting misty eyed at the touching, heart felt  moments. I watched all three in one setting. While the transfer is not the ""best"", this set is still magical & will surely awaken the child in you,  put a smile on your face & remind you that kindred spirits do in fact exist.",1326844800,,478,4.359550561797753
3240285,5,B000XSKDH4,"We are in the process of replacing our old VHS tapes with DVDs so I purchased the Sullivan Entertainment Anne Of Green Gables 5 Disc Collectors Edition DVD boxed set from Amazon with the hopes that it was closed captioned. The Amazon description does not give this information, but the Sullivan website does state that this is fully closed captioned. This is correct and it is fully closed captioned. I had to be creative with my TVs and DVD players to get the closed captioning to work. There is no option on the DVD itself to turn on the closed captioning. I first tried it on my kitchen small new ( last summer) flatscreen TV with a built in DVD player. My closed captioning is always turned on on the TV, but to turn on the closed captioning for the movie I had to press the closed caption button on the remote. My second trial was on a 15 year old TV to which I have attached a small external DVD player that I purchased last summer. This time I had to press the closed caption button on the TV remote and it worked. My third trial failed on a older TV with a built in DVD and VHS player. I connected the small external DVD player to that TV and then the closed captioning worked. I have since tried 2 other TVs with external DVD players and the closed captioning worked.  My only failure has been with our blu ray player. We have tried everything and and the closed captioning isn't avaialble there.
The closed captioning isn't available when watching the movie on my computer.
I use closed captioning on everything so that I don't have to turn the TV up so loud. I am a bit hard of hearing, but my husband isn't.
I submitted a picture of the back of the DVD package to Amazon and it shows that the DVD is closed captioned. Hopefully they will be able to change the product description.",1326844800,6,1792,4.317507418397626

3240290,5,B000XSKDH4,"This is one of those beautifully done stories that can take you away from your day to day life and entertain you as well as remind you of what is truly important in life.  The actors are terrific, the scenery is breathtakking and the main character is fun to watch grow from an orphan to a caring mother.  I would recommend this series to any family or individual looking for meaningful entertainment without any embarrasing moments.",1323216000,,433,4.684210526315789
3240291,4,B000XSKDH4,Always loved the books and I was after a few glimpses of this series on YouTube very anxious to have the DVD set: I was not disappointed! Haven't seen the last 2 DVD's yet but my hubby(even this is a 'woman's series according to him he really enjoyed it: I asked him to read the first book before watching )and me loved the first 3 DVD's : the characters jump from the screen and I love Colleen as Anne! I think the casting of all the characters is very well done: just like I imagined them while reading the books. The landscapes are beautiful and the costuming splendid! I am curious what the last DVD will be since the director has changed her adult life quite a bit and I would have liked it seen filmed like the book but I keep an open mind until I have seen it.,1322352000,,767,4.12
3240292,5,B000XSKDH4,Having recently visited Anne of Green Gables on Prince Edward Island it is fun to keep those memories current with this delightful saga. Actors in the series are the best.,1322179200,,171,4.733333333333333

3240294,4,B000XSKDH4,"I own the original DVD release of these films. I bought them separately and each is a double-sided disc. I recently bought Anne of Green Gables: The Collection to avoid having previews at the beginning and to get a menu with chapters.  Anne of Green Gables: The Collection comes with a beautiful booklet and inserts.  Unfortunately, because each film is on one side of a disc, the quality suffers: digital artifacts are noticeable.  Does anyone know if Anne of  Green Gables: the 4-Part Collection is high-quality with chapters?",1320969600,,528,4.965909090909091
3240295,5,B000XSKDH4,"My mother and I spent many special moments reading the Anne of Green Gables books together, and watching these movies helped us relive those times.  We laughed and cried all over again, and we still enjoy watching them together.

The casting was perfect.  Anne, Gilbert, Diana, Marilla, and Rachel were exactly as I had pictured them!  In fact, the actresses who played Marilla and Rachel went on to play their respective characters in the television show Avonlea that was based off of Lucy Maud Montgomery's books.

The third movie takes place when Gilbert is off at war.  For lovers of the books, just be aware that this was a storyline created entirely by the makers of the movie.  It's not a Lucy Maud Montgomery creation at all, and there is no book or story relating to this plot at all.  However, it was an enjoyable addition to the collection, even though it was my least favorite of the three.

This is a great set of movies for young girls... and for grown women who are still young girls at heart. :)",1320883200,2,1011,4.541436464088398

3240299,5,B000XSKDH4,"I have been looking forward to this collection on DVD ever since I finished reading the book series.  It did not disappoint. The characters of Anne and Gilbert were so engaging.  The humor and fun spread throughout the stories helps the viewer get through the sad times like when Anne loses her beloved caregiver Matthew Cuthbert.  As Anne grows up, goes away to school, finally admits her love for Gilbert and then has to endure his departure to war, she always has with her, the love of the Cuthberts and the strength it has given her to hold on and move forward in good times and in bad.
Anne of Green Gables is full of good values, moral judgment and clean fun.  It is truly a family classic.",1316563200,,696,4.4140625

I must say in a time when 'if it feels good do it' prevails in tween entertainment, it is refreshing to put in a great film with no 'beep' words or 'have to explain' moments.  Hollywood should take notes on this one!!!",1311552000,,365,4.323529411764706
3240307,5,B000XSKDH4,I first fell in love with this Anne of Green Gables production while visiting my grandmother in Northern Idaho more than 20 years ago.  They lived deep in the woods but did receive two or three television stations.  She recorded these from PBS in the late 1980's and we would watch and re-watch them every summer.  I have been looking forward to sharing these with my daughter and am thrilled to finally be able to do so.  I highly recommend this set.,1311033600,,451,4.463414634146342
3240308,5,B000XSKDH4,"I love these flicks. I was all of eight when I saw the first film on PBS way back in 1985 (good lord, was that really over 25 years ago?), and this film and its immediate sequel have since remained among my favorites. I am now a thirty-something male, can't claim to know much about farming, have lived in big cities most of my life and have never been to Prince Edward Island, but darn it if I didn't completely identify with these characters and want to run off to live in small-town Canada when I first saw this flick. The primary charms lie in the strength of the writing and the warmth of the central performances (Follows and the late, great actors Dewhurst and Farnsworth are all note-perfect), but the lush scenery is also a factor. At over three hours, I still wanted these picture to run longer. That should tell you something.

*Note: this review refers to the first two of the three ""Anne"" films in the collected set. The less said about that third, the better.",1310169600,,973,4.435754189944134

To see her is to see Anne as she unfolds through the pages of Montgomery's charming and insightful novel. This adaptation and performance is simply the best. It has everything one would expect from a great story, filled with charm, humor, sadness, and gladness. While it is filled with stories that touch on all the aspects of human strength and frailness it is a story of love. The pure and innocent love of a young girl who overcomes the difficulties life has dealt her. Beyond that it is a lesson in how one person filled with love and imagination can change the lives of all those she comes in contact with. I guarantee this is one story you and your family will never tire of watching.",1308700800,3,899,4.421686746987952

As the series progresses, you wish more and more that they had stuck closer to the original books, as some of Anne's adventures really don't make sense and get a little far fetched.

""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Anne of Avonlea"", and ""Anne the Continuing Story"" are all included in this DVD set which makes it a nice buy!  It's a wonderful story - bound to make you laugh, cry, swoon - a wide collection of emotions.  The actress, Megan Follows - is so extraordinary in this series.  I believe it even includes bonus features of Megan's auditions and scenes they couldn't include in the cut version because of time.  This is a great series to watch with your family - very clean and never boring in my opinion.. it starts off a little slow as it builds the foundation for the series, but if you give it a chance, you will fall in love with it!  By the way, this movie series is nothing like the books, so don't expect it to be - but I can honestly say that this movie is far better than the book, and for most book/movie comparisons I wouldn't say that - this just happens to be the exception.",1301184000,3,1021,4.237113402061856

The first one is full of the Anne-ish tales we all love (""carrots!"", the maiden lily floating into...Gilbert! and many others..) The second is my favorite...no words to describe it. You must see these wonderful DVDs! I highly recommend watching ""Road to Avonlea"" before or after you watch these...those are classics as well and have Marilla, Mrs. Lynde, etc. in them.
The third one, however, is WAY off of the books! If you're a stickly for that sort of thing, don't watch the third one. I, however, still enjoyed the third one.

Highly, highly recommend these movies for all the ""Anne at heart"" people out there! Great for families...girls and boys!",1298160000,2,724,4.792

3240329,5,B000XSKDH4,"I first fell in love with Anne of Green Gables during a PBS Pledge Drive.  I would wait & watch it everytime it was on PBS.  I also recorded my own VHS version.  Eventually I bought the trilogy when it was offered as an Anniversary package.  It's one of those good ole movies that you could watch over and over and each time, pick up something new.  Megan Follows is excellent as Anne, spelled with an ""E"", and I can't imagine anyone topping her performance.  The actors who portray Diana and Gilbert are also top notch.  You also fall in love with Colleen Dewhurst & Richard Farnsworth's performance.  The setting and scenery alone are just breathtaking.  I absolutely LOVE this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age.  Another good series to own is the Road to Avonlea.  Some of the actors from Anne are also in R2A, of course, portraying other characters.  I hope if you decide to purchase either of these dvd sets, you enjoy them as much as I do.",1291161600,,968,4.4375

3240331,4,B000XSKDH4,"I've been an Anne of Green Gables fan since I read the books when I was a little girl, and when I purchased this Anne trilogy and rewatched the first two miniseries, I remembered how much I loved the miniseries and the books when I was little. The first, Anne of Green Gables, is by far the best, and is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I have ever seen. The second, Anne of Avonlea AKA Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel, is also wonderful, a worthy sequel to the first and a lovely adaptation of the next few books in the series. And as for the third, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story... well, it's just bad. Not only does it have nothing whatsoever to do with the books besides names, it's not a good movie even when taken on its own. Other reviewers have already explained its problems, but I'll just touch on the biggest ones.
First off, it is an in-name-only adaptation of the books, so don't expect the storyline to follow the books AT ALL: second, the writing is terribly sloppy, reading more like a bad fanfic than anything else: the plot is unbelievable, chock-full of contrived coincidences (so Anne just *happened* to run into old friends and loved ones not once, not twice, but THREE times while gallivanting about Europe?): and finally, the characters have changed completely, not just from the books, but from the first two movies, as well. I realize that, in-story, years have passed between the second and third movies, but Anne, Gilbert, Diana and the rest all seem to have gone through 180 degree personality changes. And who made the decision to make Anne a klutz who squees like a fangirl every time she sees Gil? I mean, *I* squee like the fangirl I am whenever Gil comes onscreen, but I'm a viewer, I'm supposed to do that! Anne would never behave that way around Gil.
In any case, the first two miniseries are perfectly charming and fantastic, more than making up for the abortion that is The Continuing Story. I highly recommend the Anne trilogy DVD to anyone who loves Anne of Green Gables, period films or just all-around great storytelling. Watch the third at your own risk, however.

3240340,4,B000XSKDH4,"This is a collection of three Anne stories. The trilogy, as a set, has only a Three-Star rating. However, the quality of the three stories varies greatly.

The first, ""Anne of Green Gables"", was written by the author of the popular series, and is outstanding.
All characters are well acted, especially by Megan Follows as Anne Shirley. Likewise, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth deliver memorable performances as Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert. The show successfully deliveries a feeling of the simple life of those times and stirs a love of Prince Edward Island by the viewers. This movie from the CBS/PBS television series will enchant and thrill all fans. This production earns a full FIVE-Star rating.

The second story ""The Sequel"" was written by the Director, Kevin Sullivan, rather than L. M. Montgomery who created the series.
This story indicates that Sullivan is just trying to milk a sequel to his successful Anne of Green Gables series. This tale banters Anne as aloof and disdaining of both Gilbert and another suitor. She intertwines with the wealthy classes when she moves to accept a teaching position with another school. The story sets fairly well though and is enjoyable. However, it has lost most of its charm and innocence, along with Anne's wide-eye enjoyment of nature and people. Fans should still enjoy this story which does maintain the general feel on the characters.
This production earned a FOUR-Star rating.

Finally, the third story ""The Continuing Story"" is a great disappointment.
Once again, it was entirely written by Director Kevin Sullivan and departs greatly from the author's story theme. This is a dark plot revolving around war and espionage.
Reminiscent of ""The Perils of Pauline"" it wallows in misery and suffering during World War I. Apparently Sullivan wanted to recast the original actors in their roles but had to adjust the plot to accommodate the older actors. In doing so, he twists the story and creates a new setting with Gilbert as a soldier in France and Anne blundering from one scene of calamity to another. Except for the character names, there is precious little resemblance of this story to the originals.
This productions in rated only ONE-Star, and actually doesn't deserve that high. I cannot imagine fans who would not feel offended by this cheap imitation.

Please do not pass on this DVD set because of the unsatisfactory third story.
I am glad that I did buy it. I have no regrets about buying it.
I only wish that I had been aware that two were not actually written by the author and that the third was such a dark, non-typical Anne of Green Gables.",1283212800,9,2620,4.920814479638009

3240346,5,B000XSKDH4,A wonderful dvd of an enduring classic. Anne touches a spot in each of our lives. This movie is suitable for all members of the family. It deserves a place in your video library and will be watched time and time again.,1279929600,,218,4.214285714285714
3240347,3,B000XSKDH4,"I have always loved the Kevin Sullivan adaptations of the 'Anne of Green Gables' stories.  OK, maybe the first installment the best, as the second and third deviated from the original books more and more, to eventually have little to do with the L.M. Montgomery stories other than the characters.  I believe Megan Follows (who plays Anne) actually had some issues with this.

Why three stars?  Clearly, not so much my rating of the films themselves, but of the DVD quality.  The films should get 5+ stars. However, I purchased this particular DVD set under the impression that, as opposed to the earlier DVD editions, the image had been 'digitally restored,' as the package claims.  Not only was the video quality not any better than previous editions, it still is only slightly better than an VHS copy!  This has been something that has always bothered me deeply, because such gorgeous cinematography coupled with super acting deserves, in my opinion, superior quality digital editions.  To this day, the films never have gotten such treatment.  If they have, they sure do not look like it.  There is really no reason why the video quality should not be better than it is.  Maybe they tried to compress too much into too little space, I don't know.  Some scenes are almost painful to watch (i.e. the scene when Matthew and Anne arrive at Green Gables), because the image quality is quite poor.  I hope that eventually Sullivan Productions releases these films (as well as the 'Road to Avonlea' series, whose DVD releases also lack in video quality) with the quality they (and us) deserve.

So, if you have considered buying this set to replace the earlier editions with the expectation to be wowed by superb digital video restoration, save your money!  If, however, you have not yet bought any Anne films, then by all means, get them. Inferior video quality is surely made up by the beauty of the films.",1279929600,11,1904,4.7975460122699385

Ok...great series!! As for the DVD collection it is a must-have for all you Anne Shirley fans.  It is presented just as it was shown on TV so don't expect anything new or unexpected.  The only draw-back it doesn't have are subtitles, which are quite helpful in those quieter, hard-to-hear, moments.

3240366,5,B000XSKDH4,"Being a Reiki Master and Teacher I am always looking for ways to teach the concept of Manifestation of your desires.  Anne of Green Gables LIVES the concept.  Being able to live with the joy of ""imagining"" how puffed sleeves will make her feel, is an amazing description of the ""art of manifestation.""

Anne's ability to ""imagine"" herself out of any negative situation or to ""imagine"" the most beautiful outcome for any everyday occurence is amazing.

I would recommend that everyone who reads this book, try that ""imagination technique"" especially if they are finding blockages in their life in abundance or happiness.

I went into a project where I was hoping to make some money but doubting my ability to do this.  I read Anne of Green Gables JUST BEFORE leaving home and I ""Imagined"" myself ending the day with my money box full.  It was and all my expenses were paid whereas others around me were complaining that the day was slow and they made very little money.  I kept that ""joyful"" feeling with me all day which had me smiling all day.  I think I was also imagining I was wearing puffed sleeves, which I love.

3240377,5,B000XSKDH4,"Two things captivated me in these films. One was the incredible scope of Megan Follows' performance, as she plays Anne through three phases of her life.  Simply marvelous.  And second, that though the stories will appeal to all audiences, they were mainly about Anne's serious interaction with other women --her step mother,  friends in school, women of the town, women at college, women where Anne goes to teach and finally even women in Europe during the war.  There are plenty of strong men in the series, and wonderful actors, but these fine interesting relationships make this a top notch film in many respects.  The photography was very simply gorgeous. I recommend this as top flight family entertainment, and of interest to people of all ages, really.  It's a stunning portrait for a creative and imaginative woman who becomes a writer, and is a person who brings out the best in just about everyone she meets.  Positive, deep, beautiful, brilliant.

3240380,5,B000XSKDH4,"This is a great set with disks that have been *slightly* restored and extra features have been added. I am very glad they are closed captioned.

1. Anne of Green Gables is one of the best novels ever written and the mini-series is presented very well and is accurate to the book. It is an outstanding rendition. The release of this set is nicely timed with the 100th anniversary of the novel.

2. I like the first sequel even though they made changes, mostly because they were faithful to the flavour of the novel and kept most people & characters the same as they were in the books. This movie is semi-loosely based on Anne of the Island and Anne of Windy Poplars. However, I do miss Roy Gardner!

3. I do not care for the 2nd sequel because I feel they went too far from the words that made Montgomery famous. I would have preferred if they had presented Anne's House of Dreams which is one of LMM's best books. Instead they borrowed ideas from Rilla of Ingleside and made Gilbert (and Anne) go off to war. They did not present A & G's wedding well at all and I was disappointed. Jon Crombie's characterization of Gilbert was very altered. In the books Gilbert was always the jokester and ""teasy"" even when he was older. I didn't know the thin and serious Gilbert presented in this mini-series.

I'd recommend this set because of the great extra features. The 3 mini-series are nicely presented.",1214006400,7,1397,4.488188976377953
3240381,5,B000XSKDH4,"I have owned all three Anne of Green Gables Movies on VHS for quite sometime now and simply love them. I purchased this collection because I wanted to watch the scenes depicting Marilla Cuthbert's Death, which had been totally cut out of the originals.

To be honest, the producers made a good decision cutting the scenes out. They were nothing like I had anticipated and detracted from the story but I was happy to be able to finally watch them. I also, enjoyed the commentaries, which were added to the set.

I paid $84. for Anne of Green Gables: The Collection and to be honest, I think it was over priced. I ordered it expecting each movie to be on one DVD, with two bonus disc. However, the Sequel had been split among two DVD's; leaving only one DVD for commentaries and additional footage.

Anne of Green Gables is one of my all-time favorite movies and I'm most happy to have to Anne of Green Gables: The Collection at just about any price. (After all the original set of 6-VHS tapes cost just under $100. So, for Anne lovers, this is so special. I'm ordering one for my mother too.

3240382,5,B000XSKDH4,"Before I purchased this set I spent some time on the Internet looking for any kind of review for this item, to see whether or not, since I already owned the individual remastered special editions, this was worth the upgrade.

But, there was nothing.

So I took the plunge (it helped that the Costco here in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, had the set on sale for $47.99 Canadian, cheaper then even the official site was selling it for) and now, here's what you need to know.

First off, the video presentation of the films is the exact same as the individual remastered special edition DVD from years back.

Meaning it's watchable, but not the best picture quality out there.

One of the reasons for this is that the first two mini series where filmed on 16mm film stock, thus creating a slightly grainy picture.

I had hoped that since the extras on the discs where transported onto the fifth disc, that the freed up space would have allowed for better compression, and thus, better picture quality, but that is not the case.

Okay, so lets list the pros and cons of this set:

Pros:

* All the discs are single sided (not double sided like the second and third mini series DVD's in the individual sets)
* There's a nice hour plus making of retrospective with Kevin Sullivan and some of the cast members
* A nice booklet with production notes and pictures, comes with the set
* The price is less than the collective price of purchasing the three mini series DVD's individually

Cons:

* The picture hasn't been improved
* Other than the retrospective documentary, a ten minute fluff piece on the author, and the missing Morilla's Death episode (which I have yet to watch, so I can't comment on it at the present) everything else is the same as the last incarnations of the DVD's

Of note, all of the extras from the previous DVD's have been carried over including Megan Follows screen test, and are all on the fifth disc.

So if you don't already own the individual special edition DVD's, then this set is the way to go, and if you already own the individual DVD's and want more extras, then this new set is worth the upgrade, otherwise this set can be skipped.

Hope this helps.",1210636800,"1,100",2178,4.537084398976982
