8633507,5,B00HMCT8H0,I just wanted to add to all the other good reviews here.  I enjoyed this as much or more than volume one.,1402012800,,105,3.772727272727273
8633508,5,B00HMCT8H0,"These are really nice transfers form original vintage films.  The only drawback is that it is DVD-R and not a manufactured DVD.

The content is VERY RARE and, out side of the Charlie Chaplin Cartoon, the casual comedy fan will not know who these people are.

As I work for the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, I was in my glory watching these.  I wish some other silent comics got the same great careful treatment that these comedies were given in creating this DVD.

There was some IMAGE STABILIZATION used to create a steady image which greatly helps the enjoyment of these rarities.
But thankfully DNR was avoided. The films used are rather clean of major scratches and splices.
Apologies are made by Undercrank for the Chaplin cartoon, the image is good but some of the words in the balloons are hard to read.  This is apparently in the master film used.

Careful notations are made about any recreated titles to keep the presentation honest & authentic.

Ben Model created the music & expertly performed it for this release.  His love for these films comes off in his music compositions,

I am looking forward to a possible volume 3.  Even if DVD-R is the only way to affordably release these silent rarities.",1398556800,4,1215,4.683962264150943
8633509,5,B00HMCT8H0,"Ben Model's Accidentally Preserved vol. 2 does something I didn't think possible after viewing volume 1-it got better. It was made by someone who really cares about silent film and knows what works. Interestingly curated and presented with innovative scores by Ben Model (a man you can trust to score a silent film well), this is just a win all around. It has a bit of everything on this one-Chaplin, rarely seen Lloyd Hamilton etc. A super companion to volume one and I can't recommend it enough. We can only hope he has more treasures to share for a volume 3.",1389744000,9,561,4.564356435643564
8633510,5,B00HMCT8H0,"The conventional wisdom is that a sequel is habitually unable to capture the same magic as the originalbut Ben Model puts that CV to rest in ACCIDENTALLY PRESERVED, VOLUME 2  a DVD that contains nine additional silent film rarities that have thankfully been rescued from almost certain obscurity.  As with the first volume, many of the shorts and cartoons in this collection are often the only existing prints of these movie treasures from the past  and their importance to film preservation cannot be emphasized enough.

Theres a two-reel Lloyd Hamilton comedy (PAPAS BOY, 1927) in the collection that many may not be familiar withand if you're asking whos Lloyd Hamilton? at this point that is all the incentive you need to purchase the disc.  (Hamilton is a sadly neglected funster from the silent comedy erathough the reason for this is because much of his work simply did not survive the ravages of time and neglect.  Yet many comedy icons, among them Chaplin, Keaton and Charley Chase, acknowledge him as an inspiration and/or an actor whose talent was enough to provoke both envy and respect.)  The content of the collection runs from underrated comedy shorts to cartoons to public service announcements; for me, the highlight of ACCIDENTALLY PRESERVED, VOLUME 2 is the two-reel SHERLOCKS HOME (1924), a Telephone Girls comedy starring Alberta Vaughn that predates much of what we now know as situation comedy  it eschews the rough-and-tumble slapstick associated with Mack Sennetts Keystone productions and yet remains a comedic joy to watch throughout.

I should probably issue a disclaimer and reveal that I contributed to the original Kickstarter project that started the ball rolling with the ACCIDENTALLY PRESERVED DVD seriesand when its time to pass the hat around for Volume 3, Ill give willingly for that as well.  These DVDs mean too much to me as a fan of silent comedy and a staunch advocate of film preservation, and I think after sampling Volume 2 youll feel the same.",1389571200,10,1989,5.018237082066869
8633511,5,B00HMCT8H0,"As a backer for the initial Accidentally Preserved Kickstarter campaign, I was thrilled to hear that the project was successful enough to fund a second volume. Lucky for us, the quality remains top notch in terms of films included, the films' quality and Model's musical accompaniment. The films run the gamut from cartoons to comedy shorts to even an instructional safety film, and they're all interesting and entertaining in their own right. With 75% of US-made silent films considered ""lost,"" we should take everyone opportunity we get to preserve and restore the ones we discover and rediscover. That's exactly what Model is doing with these collections and I hope that there are many more volumes to come.",1389312000,5,710,5.076923076923077
8633512,5,B00HMCT8H0,"I knew that Accidentally Preserved - Volume 1 would be a tough act to follow, but the producers of Volume 2 have more than risen to the challenge. This second DVD, in what I hope will be an ongoing series, presents a number of rare treats for both the film novice and seasoned aficionado, which are sure to interest and delight. Print quality is generally very good, although you might see a quick blemish here or there. The music scores are all outstanding, but with Ben Model at the helm, I would expect nothing less. It's great to see these forgotten, yet highly entertaining films, often derived from a single copy which managed to survive the ravages of time. My favorite has got to be ""Papa's Boy"" with the inimitable Lloyd Hamilton. Hats off to the folks who brought us this latest edition of a fascinating series! I'm waiting with baited breath for the next...",1388707200,3,868,4.606451612903226
