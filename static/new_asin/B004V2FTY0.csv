8442661,4,B004V2FTY0,It is one of greatest performance ever made by Sanjay Dutt. this movie is primarily based on the firm bondage between two brothers Sanjay Dutt and Kumar Gourav and gradually turned into the saga of Sanjay alone. This film also made Paresh Rawal as a stunning villain of Hindi film industry. The song Chtti Aihey by Pankaj Udhas is one of his most touching songs. Above all this film is the turning point of the career of Sanjay Dutt and the mile stone for director Mahesh Bhatt as a commercial director.,1305849600,,503,4.538461538461538
