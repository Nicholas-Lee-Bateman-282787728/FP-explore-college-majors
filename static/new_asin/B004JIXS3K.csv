8431898,5,B004JIXS3K,"Not only does the Blu-Ray look amazing, but the whole movie is so anti-ocean it's comical!
We start with divers going down to catch some supper. They violently yank lobsters out of their cozy little holes without giving a crap.
Then we move on to the coral reef. A beautiful display of nature. Let's collect some samples! They dive down with big hammers and break off large chunks of the coral.
Time to take a census of the creatures that live in the reef.... KABOOM!!! They blow up the reef with dynamite, collect all the dead fish, and lay them out on the beach. All the while talking about how dynamite fishing is illegal and vandalism.
Then they go cruising around the ocean on diver propulsion vehicles shredding up beds of seaweed and steering into schools of fish. One of the guys gets bored terrorizing fish, so he hops off the vehicle and rides a sea turtle.
Then we move on to the majestic sperm whales. The crew tries to harpoon one for no reason until they run over a baby whale. The thing is bleeding all over creation so they decide to shoot it in the head with a rifle.
Once the baby whale is good and dead, sharks come around and start munching on it. The crew gets bored watching sharks be sharks and decide to yank the sharks out of the water and brutally murder them with axes on the deck. It's hysterical when they say they're getting revenge for the baby whale...... that they're responsible for murdering.
Then we chill on land with the giant tortoises. The crew yet again messes with the wildlife riding the turtles and smacking birds.
One last dive. The crew decides to cut up some chum and feed it to a large grouper. Everybody has their fun molesting the poor fish until they lock him up in a cage and make him watch other fish being fed. (They eventually let it go. At least they didn't kill any fish this time.)

Overall, it's a good movie to get high and watch how hilariously cruel they are to everything. If you're not into torturing fish, perhaps you'll get a kick out of the terrible acting by the crew along with their poorly dubbed english accents.
The Silent World is an instant classic!",1397865600,3,2123,4.443589743589744
8431899,5,B004JIXS3K,"I have been waiting to see this film since 1960, which was the year I discovered it had been made. As far as I know, it was never available on VHS or DVD. I had no idea until it appeared on my screen that it was in color. I thought that it, like the pictures in Captain Cousteau's book of the same name, would be in grainy black and white. The color is great on Blu-ray. If you've been diving for over 50 years like I have, this is a must-see. If you're new to the sport, and you dive with a BC and octopus and computers, check out this stripped-down, low tech heroes.",1376784000,,568,3.991228070175439
8431900,5,B004JIXS3K,"I have been trying to get this doc. for about 25 years, It won numerous awards when it was first shown in Cannes,France back in 1956. People that are divers or plan to be should put this on their MUST SEE LIST!",1372291200,,210,4.023809523809524
8431901,5,B004JIXS3K,Cousteau is a worldwide icon who defined the delivery of sea exploration to the masses.  Without him there would be no Shark Week or the plethora of nature shows and videos that exist.  You have to watch this to see what started the whole genre.,1368662400,,245,4.4222222222222225
8431902,5,B004JIXS3K,"These three videos (Silent World, World without Sun, and Voyage to the Edge of the World) of explorations from up to 60 years ago brought back such good memories.  Cousteau was such a pioneer, and the footage in these videos documenting first-time observations and explorations is wonderful.  I wish more of his work was available to purchase.",1364774400,2,343,5.0
8431903,4,B004JIXS3K,"Extremely well done. However, it was clear that there are many things in the early years of Cousteau's adventures that I would not consider complimentary. Specifically, the incident with the whales and sharks. That said, his later accomplishments highlight how he has evolved to learn from his past mistakes. This is the role that pioneers play. We can all learn from them.

I strongly encourage people to purchase the video.",1320624000,9,425,5.071428571428571
