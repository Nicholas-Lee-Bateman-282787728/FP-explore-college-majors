6258522,5,B00ID25J2Q,My one year old loves it.  Can hold his attention for hours while no other dvd has been able to do it.  His four year old sister watches it with him and she loves it too.  Best money ever spent.  Great dvd!,1405123200,3,206,3.8333333333333335
6258523,5,B00ID25J2Q,My little one is obsessed with these nursery rhymes. Wonderful!!!!! Highly recommend to everyone. Just be prepared to be singing them in your head 24 hours a day.,1403308800,3,162,4.821428571428571

6258525,2,B00ID25J2Q,My dvd's broke easily....They are very sensitive...I paid quite a bit to have them not function anymore.,1455580800,,104,5.176470588235294
6258526,1,B00ID25J2Q,Both the cds in the box arrived totally scratched and unusable. I had ordered these for my kids as they love hoopla and we wanted them urgently on our trip . So disappointing !! I couldn't even return or replace them before leaving ( The cds arrived a day before my flight )  and they are not allowing me to do either now.,1450310400,,322,4.111111111111111
6258527,5,B00ID25J2Q,Great  i lovet,1447977600,,14,3.6666666666666665
6258528,5,B00ID25J2Q,Babies love this.  Very glad we were able to purchase the DVD,1447200000,,61,4.083333333333333
6258529,5,B00ID25J2Q,FAB! My daughter (6months) loves it and my husband and I like it too!,1446854400,,69,4.0
6258530,4,B00ID25J2Q,"4 stars because my son loves it. We can do our chores while this is playing. I wanna give 5 stars but when I found out that I can play hooplakidz from youtube, I gotta take 1 star off. We seldom use the disc now since we have a smart TV where we can easily pull up youtube.  Thanks for replacing the damage disc.",1446595200,,312,3.875
6258531,5,B00ID25J2Q,"We've been watching Hooplakidz for a year, ever since our son was born. This program is incredible - it's amazing how he literally focuses on the songs and the animation; he claps along with ""If You're Happy and You Know It"", and knows the body parts for ""Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"", etc.  We purchased the DVD's because as much as we love the Youtube channel, it is making the Hooplakidz logo burn in the tv set.

But it works just as well! Love the dvs's as much as my son. We have so much fun doing them together!",1444089600,2,523,4.2727272727272725
6258532,1,B00ID25J2Q,Very bad quality.,1444089600,,17,5.0
6258533,5,B00ID25J2Q,My kids (ages 7-1) enjoy these songs and the fun videos. I appreciate that they are easy to listen to unlike most music geared towards young children.,1443744000,,150,4.592592592592593
6258534,5,B00ID25J2Q,I got this for my grandson for a long car ride.  He loved it.  It had enough material on it to keep us sane for many hours on the road. There were verses to nursery rhymes that I had never heard so Nana learned something too.,1442880000,,225,3.869565217391304
6258535,1,B00ID25J2Q,"I don't know who is writing these nice reviews for this package, but this DVD package is horrible! I bought it because I thought it was the one my daughter loves since she was six months old from another site. Just search for ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" on (you know where the popular online site that hosts videos is.) These reviewers either don't know better or these are fake reviews written by the seller.
I bought it and has it shipped one-day shipping by paying extra, but I am very disappointed after watching it. Just click on the above link and watch the other one to see the difference for yourself.",1442188800,,603,4.441441441441442
6258536,3,B00ID25J2Q,I bought this to travel so my son will be entertained on the long flights. He loves Hooplakids!!!  But who uses dvds now a day. And I can't transfer the files to my tab or other hand held devices. This sucks :(,1438646400,,210,4.0
6258537,5,B00ID25J2Q,"Worth the money, i was using too much data on my mobile device, but now i just turn it on and my son loves it",1438646400,,109,3.4
6258538,5,B00ID25J2Q,My granddaughter loves it,1438300800,,25,5.5
6258539,4,B00ID25J2Q,Catchy renditions of popular kids songs. Colorful animations  some are a little creepy but my 2-year-old loves them.,1424044800,,116,5.444444444444445
6258540,5,B00ID25J2Q,"My grand daughter loves Hooplakidz stuff, and this DVD fills the bill.",1422403200,,70,4.916666666666667
6258541,5,B00ID25J2Q,"My kids LOVED these discs and sing the songs even when not watching. Bright, colorful videos bring new life to old classics.",1416614400,,124,4.681818181818182
6258542,3,B00ID25J2Q,"I bought this for my 1 yr old. She is interested for a bit, then loses interest (she does not have the same reaction to other DVDs). I think the cartoons are kind of old fashioned at this point. Songs are cute though. Will keep trying, maybe she'll get to appreciate it more.",1413763200,,275,4.2075471698113205
6258543,5,B00ID25J2Q,Great DVDs .One made a great Idd present.,1413331200,,41,4.25
6258544,5,B00ID25J2Q,My daughter loved this starting at 4 months!,1412812800,,44,4.625
6258545,3,B00ID25J2Q,I was a bit disappointed because it only plays the rhymes. On the you tube version the charatcer will sometimes talk before singing the rhymes. My son would get excited and scream when she spoke. But I guess its ok,1412812800,,214,4.375
6258546,5,B00ID25J2Q,"We've been waiting for these to come on disc after finding it on youtube.  There are a lot of songs in this set and my child loves them all especially ""Simple Simon"".  I think because he bounces as he runs funny.  This is like a greatest hits collection for the pre-K set.  The product comes surprisingly out of India but the woman does not have an accent who sings. She has a great voice that's pleasant on the ears.  I can actually stand this DVD. Not like ""Giggle Bellies"" which scares the bejesus outta me.  Look one up and you'll see why.  My kid loves that disc too but I don't like the video or audio myself.  These discs are just like you're listening to someone in a coffee shop with a guitar sing them.  So if you expect that you know what you're getting.  5 stars, love it!",1412380800,,784,4.201342281879195
6258547,5,B00ID25J2Q,"Absolutely LOVE this DVD for my 10 month old daughter! She loves watching it, she stops whatever she is doing and watches them over and over again, and it provides me great peace for a little while too :) I even went and bought another to give to my friend for her baby we love it that much! I highly recommend this, its a wonderful and very well done DVD.",1412208000,3,356,4.1

6258562,5,B00ID25J2Q,"I am so glad that the songs are finally on a DVD! We've been watching them on YouTube since our daughter was a little over a year old, and a year later she still loves them. Sings along to most of the songs too! It will be wonderful not to have to deal with commercials or have the need for an internet connection at all times.",1407110400,3,327,3.9696969696969697
