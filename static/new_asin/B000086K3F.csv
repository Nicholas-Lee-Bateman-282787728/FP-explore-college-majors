7979231,2,B000086K3F,"It  sugar coats how nasty competition between the two railroad corporation was.  For example, this DVD does not tell the story that as both companies got close to each other that before the Promontory Summit, Utah  agreement - the irish work crews from Central Pacific started attacking and killing  the Union Pacific chinese work crews. The Irish work crew had guns the chinese work crews did not have guns. At the golden spike agreement the firing off of guns into the air had scared off all of the chinese work crew - which is why there are no chinese in the official photograph of the Golden spike ceremony at the Promontory Summit .  The context of the chinese railroad worker story did not include that at that time Chinese railroad workers who immigrated to the USA could not become US citizens because the  Naturalization Act (1790 to 1802 versions)  forbid non-white persons from gaining US citizenship... the American Experience spent a significant time  focusing  on the personal experiences of the entrepreneurs and financial elites who  built the first Transcontinential Rail Road but it does not any time on the personal experience of the chinese or irish rail road workers... so it is biased in that way.",1513555200,,1219,4.87378640776699

7979234,5,B000086K3F,"This PBS DVD is a great piece of work. The DVD goes into depth about everything from the railroad construction, the finances and the amazingly blatant corruption of both Thomas Durant and the government officials. Very informative and enjoyable.",1329868800,,245,5.3076923076923075
7979235,4,B000086K3F,"This was an excellent film for a person like myself who does not have a background in American History. There were questions in my mind about the workers and their life while building the railroad but I understand there are films available concerning this topic.  All in all, I enjoyed learning more about the history of the railroad and how it came to be.  I will now take a transcontinental train trip myself to experience the terrain and envision those hardy men enduring the hardships that came with each blow to a spike.",1238803200,,525,4.634408602150538
7979236,4,B000086K3F,"""American Experience - Transcontinental Railroad"" is a meticulously researched and informative documentary, but it is not well-suited for use in high schools.  The film provides a very slow and detailed narrative of events, and no single episode concisely captures the main themes that most  teachers are looking to convey to their students. It would be very difficult to use this film as part of a 50-minute lesson without repeated use of the fast-forward button.

The film also does not cover certain facts commonly emphasized in high school classrooms. The Pacific Railway Act is discussed in some detail for example, but the narrator fails to mention the law by name. Railroad workers for the Union Pacific company are correctly described as Civil War veterans, but the fact that they were also disproportionately Irish is left out. The same is not true for the film's treatment of the Central Pacific Company where the fact that the company's workers were Chinese is emphasized at great length.

A strong documentary - but teachers should watch this one at home.",1232064000,15,1067,5.08
7979237,4,B000086K3F,"After having read Stephen Ambrose about the Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869, ""Nothing Like It In the World"" I became fascinated by the difficulties experienced in that construction, particularly those of the Central Pacific in building across the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  Because there was no one DVD that told the whole story, I bought three of them---the current one under review as well as  two History Channel DVDs, ""The Railroads That Tamed The West"" and ""Transcontinental Railroad"".  Together these three DVDs provide a comparatively good understanding of the hardships and difficulties encountered by those responsible and engaging in this monumental task of construction.  Aside from all the hype about the ""Robber Barons,"" these men really took momentous risks in engaging in this construction.  And they did become wealthy as a result.  But who among you would take the risks they undertook for any less?  I give each of these DVDs four stars because each in its own way is good, but none tell the whole story.  Read the Book, it's excellent.",1222992000,7,1075,5.173410404624278
7979238,5,B000086K3F,"We completely enjoyed the historical accuracy of the piece - it was both entertaining and educational - conveying the vision of some, the greed of others and the shear willpower to accomplish an almost unbelievable task of running rail across the vastness of continental US inspite of the dangers and obstacle associated with the work.",1214265600,2,335,5.109090909090909
7979239,5,B000086K3F,"This DVD is amazing.  From the visionaries and engineers, to the politicians and RR companies - mostly in it for the money, to the workers - ex-soldiers and Chinese, this DVD covers the building of the Transcontinental Railroad very thoroughly and doesn't sugar coat the greed and self-seeking of some.  It includes the bittersweet dialogue via letters of one RR supervisor and his wife back in Ohio.  I think it is ideal for high school and above.  Maybe more info than middle schoolers want. I loved the maps that showed the RR as it was being built. It includes a Teacher's Guide in Adobe PDF format.",1203552000,12,603,4.660377358490566
7979240,5,B000086K3F,"You will end up with full knowledge of the story of the Transcontinental Railroad after viewing this. It leaves nothing out...covers everything completely and fairly as far as I can tell. Chock full of primary source pictures and quotes, it's an interesting and educational production that may be the standard of comparison for future endeavors on this important achievement in American history.",1166832000,29,395,5.387096774193548
