8553812,2,B00AMKV4PS,"I purchased this through Pitsco, a company that sells engineering supplies for classes. I wish I had seen it here and saved $13. This video is not worth the money. It is only 20 mins long and features cut away shots to cars, planes, and other ""cool"" things. True those things involve engineering, but there is no real content discussed. I really thought there would be a more in depth look at engineering. The author/narrator talks about the merits of engineering, but we really do not get a glimpse into the engineering world. I have found better materials on Youtube. I bought this hoping to share what engineers do with my students, but don't think they truly get that from this video. The last bit promotes Lego League, a defunct robotics platform that has ran its course and been replaced with Vex Robotics and Arduino kits in most schools. Save your money and use online resources.",1492473600,,887,4.6923076923076925
