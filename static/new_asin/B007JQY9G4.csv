from the look,s and rating It is a very wonderful Cdor DVD..",1375833600,,130,3.8518518518518516
5091825,5,B007JQY9G4,"This is an excellent DVD/CD combo.  I do wish more of the performances were complete in the DVD but they were long enough to get the feeling of being at a juke joint.

The CD has longer performances and the sound quality is pretty good.

I can't really add much to the first reviews.  If you like authentic music.  If you've been to the North Mississippi Hill Country Picnic and Blues Festival and had a great time.  And if you just want to hear music being played because they love the music you should get this set.

'Nuff said.",1347321600,2,530,4.292929292929293
5091826,5,B007JQY9G4,"This is a film that is well worth watching multiple times.  There are parts of the film that are very sad as it shows the struggles of the Blues in Mississippi, but at the same time it is inspiring watching the great Blues performers that are still there, thus the uplift (and that is in part what the Blues is all about).  The quality of the cinematography/editing/sound is topnotch.  My favorite performers in this film are Big A & The All-Stars and Terry Harmonica Bean.  The interviews with Red are great!",1345939200,3,509,4.56043956043956
5091827,5,B007JQY9G4,"Splendid DVD (and companion CD) - well filmed and recorded, reminiscent of the exceptional ""You See Me Laughing"" blues DVD. It will be a long time before this CD leaves rotation in my car. Don't dilly dally getting down to The Delta to absorb this hypnotic, CURRENT experience. The Clarksdale-Memphis-Oxford triad is a gem full of vast delights - historic, musical, literary, gastronomic, social - to be discovered, all pulsed by the Mississippi River.  I first came from the Virginia in 2009. It's pulled me back every year since - now it's a scheduled, annual event. Roger Stolle at the Cat Head store (and website) in Clarksdale can make sure you don't miss anything important during you visit. Have an unforgetable, historic good time!",1344556800,2,739,4.959677419354839
5091828,5,B007JQY9G4,"This brand new documentary from Jeff Konkel and Roger Stolle gives a true vision of the today situation of the juke joints and the blues in the Delta area. Remarkably filmed, it intersperes strong interviews with musicians, juke joint owners and patrons with great musical sets. Very well filmed and recorded. Enthralling!
And what a good idea to have subtitled the film, a thing that is very often lacking from US music documentaries and nevertheless very useful for non-Americans. This essential set combines the DVD + a CD of all the songs featured in the film.",1335225600,6,564,4.885416666666667
8518455,5,B007JQY9G4,"Another great Blues episode and presentation of Blues performers most of whom we were unaware of. No pretenses here, just the basic way of life in the South of those times. They lived a life as it was inherited and music was part of their soul which had to be expressed in all its basic avenues.
Saves me a personal trip to visit that area and its history.",1447632000,,356,4.25
8518456,5,B007JQY9G4,"Fascinating look at the remaining juke joints, the disappearance of juke joint culture, and the people who try to keep it going.  Inspired a trip to the Mississippi Delta where we found the juke joints and the people from the movie.  Loved it.",1433808000,,243,4.627906976744186
8518457,5,B007JQY9G4,A trip back in time to a life little lived now. I grew up in the south so all this is real and not made up. Good job.,1429747200,,117,3.2142857142857144
8518458,4,B007JQY9G4,"Mississippi and the delta region has a rich history of blues music that lives on to this day. Regrettably, the venues for this heritage -- juke joints -- are being supplanted by casinos and other forms of entertainment that devalue live music and socialization around it. This documentary focuses on the few places that have retained these valuable historical venues and makes us appreciate those who few places and few individuals that have kept this tradition alive-- most notably Red Padon of Reds Lounge in Clarksdale, Mississippi. If you can't travel to the delta and see it for yourself, this documentary is the next best thing. We owe a great debt not only to the musicians and owners/proprietors of juke joints, but also to Roger Stolle and Jeff Konkel who document and keep alive one of the great gems of American musical history, past and present.",1407283200,,857,4.876712328767123

8518460,4,B007JQY9G4,Wonderful evocative story - a must for every blues fan. Will make you want to go to Mississippi - Now!,1399852800,,102,4.15
8518461,3,B007JQY9G4,"After reading reviews, I was expecting a little more from this documentary.  It presents some interesting history, but I found it's presentation to be rather ""slow""--to the point of being boring at times.",1399420800,,204,5.181818181818182
8518462,5,B007JQY9G4,"If you love blues , you will love this DVD. I visited Clarksdale a few years ago and I want to go back NOW! This is history being recorded as it fades away right in front of our eyes.",1391558400,,183,3.717948717948718
8518463,5,B007JQY9G4,"This is a great video about the history of, and disappearance of, the juke joints.  We went to Red Paden's juke joint (Red's in Clarksdale, MS) in July and had a fabulous time.  It is an experience like no other.  I highly recommend this video!!",1381622400,,245,4.4

will be even better.",1378339200,,131,3.888888888888889
