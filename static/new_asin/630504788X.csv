957738,3,630504788X,"Had been awhile since seen any of Shannon Whirry movies & recently found the Fatal Pursuit DVD listed on Amazon.
A sexy British insurance investigator (Shannon Whirry) whom meets & partners up with a private investigator (L.P. Brown III) to recover stolen diamonds hidden somewhere in New Orleans. The story/plot is alright & Shannon Whirry is Shannon Whirry. Also starring:Malcolm McDowell,Charles Napier,Larry Manetti,Obba Babba Tunde,Larry Linville.
Paper insert inside DVD case is a ""small"" photo of Shannon with the movies chapter selection.",1388793600,5,546,5.670731707317073
957739,2,630504788X,"This movie doesn't make it as a wild action film or as a mystery.  The comedy mostly falls flat, the male lead is dreadful and the plot seems to have been written on a cocktail napkin.  None of the characters is  particularly believable.  So why did I give the movie 2 stars?  Shannon  Whirry.  That's it.  She is the ONLY reason to watch this one.  She looks  fabulous and has a great but too short shower scene.  The love scene is  good but this movie needs lots more Shannon and lots less of everything  else.  (And although I think Shannon Whirry looks great here I also think  they should have fired the dialect coach: I never once believed she was  English.)",952732800,19,664,4.363636363636363
