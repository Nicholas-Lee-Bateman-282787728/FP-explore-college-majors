4190029,5,B003T09AWM,"This is a fabulous version of one of my favorite books. I already have every other version that exists and found this DVD to be a real treasure.  Since I already had the 3 disc mini series, I was happy to find this complete version. This has extra episodes not found on the other version. The cast, Richard E. Grant, Martin Shaw and Elizabeth McGovern are brilliant..... the sets, costumes and exteriors are terrific.  I've already watched it  numerous times (can't get enough of it). Great !!!!!!!",1456790400,2,498,4.7011494252873565
4190030,4,B003T09AWM,"An entertaining, fast-paced series with lots of witty banter and action and adventure as the English spy--the Pimpernel--outwits the Frenchies to save the French aristocrats from Lady Guillotine. However, why is it EVERYONE speaks with an English accent, even the French? Even the Scarlet Pimpernel when he is posing as a Frenchman. Bizarre that. Just took the reality of it away. They could have at least tried to make the French sound French. The episodes without Elizabeth McGovern are, in my opinion, not as good as those with her. She added something as the Pimpernel's wife not in the others. The woman they tried to attach him to in one of the subsequent episodes failed miserably in my mind to stir any meaningful chemistry between them. Still, it's a good series and I do not regret buying it.",1455408000,8,802,4.818840579710145

4190032,5,B003T09AWM,"It only took a little over year for this to ship out. Great! It doesn't matter, I'm still happy that I finally get to see this again. It is definitely worth the wait. I loved it when it came out awhile back and excited to see it again. I love this adaptation because I love how Richard Grant portrays his character. Highly recommended but not sure of the difference between this one and the other A&E box set of the same adaptation.",1454371200,4,432,4.280487804878049
4190033,1,B003T09AWM,"Whoever considers buying this set should be sure they can play European DVD's. I did not notice that it was European only and it
cost me half the price of the set just to return it. BEWARE!!!",1398988800,2,191,4.1891891891891895
4190034,4,B003T09AWM,This is no doubt a very good series but this D.V.D. WON'T PLAY in the U.K. Buyer beware !!!,1488326400,,91,3.8421052631578947
4190035,5,B003T09AWM,Really good film/series --- very well acted and intriguing plot lines ! A really good mega-dose of heroism !!!,1488326400,,110,4.842105263157895
4190036,5,B003T09AWM,"Love this series so much. The first three are by far the best written and most talented cast. Wish they had kept the original writers and actors throughout the entire series. A bit pricey for the set but I paid it anyway, that's how good the first three episodes are.",1487462400,2,267,4.36
4190037,5,B003T09AWM,I read the book while in high school and fell in love with the story. The book is as good as the book with some differences. Wonderful actors!,1486944000,,142,4.107142857142857
4190038,5,B003T09AWM,"My wife and I watched this on TV several years ago and loved it. Richard Grant does a great job of play the title character without overdoing the foppish side, a serious problem in previous versions. One of the themes that runs through all the parts is the genuine love between Lord Percy and his beautiful wife, something rare in movies these days and it proved to be an absolute delight.",1486339200,4,389,4.492957746478873

4190042,5,B003T09AWM,A delightful version of the classic tale with plenty of swashbuckling fun. I wish there were more episodes.,1473724800,,107,5.0
4190043,5,B003T09AWM,I remember watching this years ago when I was a teenager and have been wanting it since. It does not disappoint. Just like I remembered it. I fell in love with this series all over again.,1471824000,,187,4.222222222222222
4190044,1,B003T09AWM,"Not near as good as the book. I almost watched this with my kids, so glad I didn't. Too much sex, which wasn't even in the book. It moved way to fast to be a whole series. I only watched the first episode but they pretty much had the whole love story in it. Not sure where they will take it from there.  And all the tricks the Scarlett Pimpernel uses to desieve the french are completely excluded from it. Stick with the 90s version or the book.",1469145600,9,445,4.056818181818182
4190045,4,B003T09AWM,"I had purchased the A&E three disc set and thought it was the complete set. Recently I found that there were two series and the only way to get series two was to purchase it together with series one (what I had already purchased). I purchased the complete series 1 & 2 although I really hate this kind of marketing that forces you to buy what you already have.
The actual programs were quite enjoyable, but diverged widely from the books. Margureite Blakeney was written out in series two, so they gave Percy Blakeney a sort of side kick. I wonder if Elizabeth McGovern left the production for some reason and they decided not to recast. Whatever the case, I think the production suffered from the absence of the character of Lady Blakeney.
If you like series that stick closer to the source material you may not care for these programs, but I thought they were well written, well produced and very entertaining.",1466985600,,912,4.601226993865031
4190046,5,B003T09AWM,I first saw this on bravo channel when I was a teenager and fell in love with it so when I found out that it was a full series and that it was on DVD I had to buy,1466467200,,162,3.1794871794871793
4190047,4,B003T09AWM,It close to the Hispanic Zorro Version.  Thus is the English version,1466380800,,68,4.666666666666667
4190048,5,B003T09AWM,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I'd heard the name Scarlet Pimpernel when I was growing up but knew nothing about him.  I wish the series was longer, I was sad when I was done watching it.  I actually watched it a few times as each time I picked up on something I'd missed previously.",1464912000,2,287,4.277777777777778

4190051,2,B003T09AWM,"If you really love the 18th century as a time period -- the Enlightenment, the Revolution, Absolutism, ruffles, lace, wigs etc--- then you will watch this show just for the sets, as I did.
I even enjoyed myself most of the time. But I never felt like rewatching any of it, which was a bad sign.
The producers took a more male centered, James Bond approach to the Pimpernel. This didn't bother me in itself. I didn't mind him being more of an action guy instead of a disguises guy. But most episodes did miss out on the Pimpernel as witty and deceptive, and no amount of researched historic gore makes up for that.
Some of the dialogue is good, and the opening sequence is awesome. Makes the actual show a let down in comparison to what it had the potential to be.
Chauvelin rapidly becomes the most sympathetic character, and Robespierre the most interesting, but the brilliant Richard Grant makes sure Sir Percy is never outshone. After a while you watch the show just for Grant, who is absolutely amazing in his role.
The serious mistake made by the producers is Marguerite. Elizabeth McGovern is a lovely actress, and I don't blame her for what happened. The James Bond genre is not going to be friendly to a wife character, and Marguerite is deliberately made to look old, frumpy, and fat. This was a terrible move, as most of the viewers were the kind of women who loved the 1995 P&P and wanted to identify with someone more like Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennett.
The violence was overdone and occasionally very poorly handled. I particularly thought the gruesome and unnecessary murder of Armands girlfriend should not have been juxtaposed with a bed scene between Marguerite and Percy. That looked awful. I don't know what the director was thinking.
Mademoiselle Guillotine was the best episode. One of the few where Sir Percy was allowed to be smart and sneaky as well as good with a gun.
Kidnapped King started out well-- and Marguerite actually looked pretty in some scenes-- but the end was cheesy and implausible.
Not really worth your time, but interesting if you're bored.",1461628800,7,2087,4.720547945205479
4190052,4,B003T09AWM,"Although it was filmed years ago, it was very well done. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Grant was a perfect Pimpernel!",1461369600,,110,4.842105263157895
4190053,5,B003T09AWM,"a fun, fantastically swashbuckling series of stories (and because it's a period piece, the dialogue is more intriguing/nuanced than one finds in most action adventures).  also, richard e. grant -- rather surprisingly -- makes a splendid action hero; who knew?

i wasn't really into the extras, but they certainly hired top-tier talent for them.

i highly recommend this set of dvd's.",1461196800,,383,5.245901639344262
8404891,4,B003T09AWM,"As the WWF Wrestler 'The Godfather' often opined, ""Pimpin' Aint Easy!""  The first season is grand, with Robespierre's villainy fully revealed in a riveting performance.  Grant and McGovern breathe verve and life into this story.",1528156800,,228,5.485714285714286
8404892,5,B003T09AWM,I love these. Wish I had more episodes. Love the characters.,1519862400,,60,4.545454545454546
8404893,1,B003T09AWM,"When I purchased my copy I wasn't aware that it was a tv series, I figured it was a BBC movie or miniseries and that it was only based on the original novel.  As many of the reviews here make clear (wish I'd seen them first) there are separate episodes telling different stories, all involving the Scarlet Pimpernel but not apparently focused on him (after the first one).  I probably wouldn't have purchased had I known this as I wasn't terribly invested in other people's stories and after the first episode I couldn't get more than halfway through the second before turning it off.

Having said that my review is really only on the first episode.  I found the costume to be lazy, Marguerite is supposed to be a leader of fashion and yet every outfit she wears is ill fitting and frumpy.  In regards to plot, the tension of if the villain would discover, prove and catch the Pimpernel is done away with early one because Chaver (sp) confronts Percy midway through and makes clear that he knows that Percy is the Pimpernel and Percy has to escape.  Instead of confirming who the Pimpernel is this story is about getting leverage against him to have him give up his network? Why should he care about the Pimpernel's network when he has the Pimpernel, or is the Pimpernel not really all that important and easily replaceable if executed?  If that's the case, again, what's the point of making a movie about him?  Writing was sloppy as well.  Why would the villain, having accomplished his goal of discovering the Pimpernel's identity beyond any doubt, why not reveal it to anyone?  At the very least won't making it known who the Pimpernel was prevent him from returning to France?  And finally, on that point, where the heck were his disguises?  The Pimpernel is a master of disguise, he accomplishes his escapes in disguise, and manages to keep his identity secret because he is often disguised.  In the movie this is not the case.  Sir Percy operates in plane sight.  He doesn't seem to care who knows that he's the Pimpernel (which is why Chaver had no problem discovering it).  Not once does he so much as change his hair or effect a different accent or walk.  The premises of the novel is that he disguises himself from his wife, pretending to be an idiot fop, even this was not really accomplished, yes he pretends not to be the Scarlet Pimpernel, but he is very witty as a dandy and often makes jokes instead of being the but of them.  And yet at some point in the movie someone comments on his mastery of disguise, which I found hilarious.  Finally, if you are going to effect a success escape, and prevent anyone from knowing who you are it is a good idea NOT to have your friends calling out your name while surrounded by the enemy which happens numerous times in the movie.

I did think that some of the acting was good but it couldn't make up for the rest.",1507075200,,2868,4.5
8404894,3,B003T09AWM,"Wish I'd know more about the French Revolution before I watched ... the husband and wife actor and actress didn't seem to have ""real"" chemistry",1501718400,,143,4.76
8404895,5,B003T09AWM,"Love Richard E. Grant as Sir Percy Blakeney. Grant does a wonderful job in his portrayal. Love Elizabeth McGovern as well. The second season was pretty lackluster, primarily due to the writing not the performances. McGovern is missing as they've killed off Marguerite and you don't have the repartee that you had in the first season. However, if you love the Scarlett Pimpernel stories you'll be entertained immensely with the first season, and you'll enjoy the second season.",1499644800,3,476,5.115384615384615

8404898,5,B003T09AWM,"This is a fun series that manages  serious and  comic scenarios.  Martin Shaw's ' Citizen Chauvelin', is easiy the most interesting, and complex character:  His  Chauvelin, is deadly  yet loving, adversarial yet complicit. And he is by turns comic.  Richard E. Grant is a joy to watch as the Pimpernel, and he cuts a great figure in his gorgeous dandy outfits.

At about $31.00, this is a great value for 6 episodes - on 3 discs.  The 4th  disc  ( 'Special Features'),  contains an old,  and undistinquished  history of some  events of the French  Revolution, as well as  audio  by the Baroness de Orczy, the author of the book upon which the Pimpernel series were based.

One could completely pass the 4th disc over, and still get one's money worth, and more. Highly recommended.",1492560000,3,780,4.686567164179104

8404900,4,B003T09AWM,The first 3 episodes are excellent. There is some slippage in the final 3 as characters died or simply disappear. Number 6 is the worst. Could use more explanation as to how/why events occurred.,1488326400,,194,4.735294117647059
