8244373,4,B00126LX70,"I really liked the movie and I also understand that because it was inspired by the song (of the same name) it had to follow a certain path, but tragic ending love stories has been explored and exploited plenty of times before this one. The two main characters were very likable and at times very credible. The pride and love from the brother to the sister are very well expressed on his own way (and privacy), yet they are not express explicitly on the same way the sister did.

The movie is good, but maybe it is good because of the performances, and not necessarily for the story telling. The issue of love between step brother-sister is only mentioned, and avoided, never confronted. The tragic ending really feels like a convenient situation to finish up the movie.

The sense of time passing by was not all that obvious (to me), it is only because we know of the sister's academic advances from high school to college that one needs to conclude that 3 years has passed by. Visually, very little changes from the main characters until the last 20 minutes of the film. They don't age, and the only clue really is that the sister does not wear a uniform, even hair styles remain the same. The sense of time should have been made more obvious since it would also support the idea of what would only be described as torture for the sister of having to live in such close proximity to a man who she loves as a man, not as a brother.

In film one can only comment in what is shown on screen, one can not speculate on what each character did or felt when not in camera. We don't know what the brother felt; he never expressed any manly love towards the sister, not even a physical attraction to her. Again, the movie was good and I liked it but it might have also been a bit too ""clean"", a bit too innocent. Carnal desires were kept out of the picture, even though two young adults who have no blood links are living in close quarters.

I appreciate that some times directors prefer making their audience guess and speculate, but it would have been nice had the brother had a chance to confide on his friend that he was indeed attracted physically to his sister but kept his desires at bay for the sake of their chaste and innocent relationship. More merit (and love) would be due to the young brother for controlling his (only) manly instincts.",1275350400,,2342,4.414351851851852
8244374,5,B00126LX70,"As you can tell from the title, this movie is presented as a tearjerker, and true, it did manage to squeeze a few tears out of me. However, I would consider this movie anything but the typical teary love story.

This movie is probably more light-hearted than other Japanese ""Pure Love"" genre romances, with comedic relief from various side characters, as well as that hilarious nose-pinching thing (which becomes more relevant throughout the movie). The side characters also serve as a sort of barrier between the two main characters (played by Satoshi Tsumabaki and Masami Nagasawa), and add to the emotional drama in general. The scenery is great, and the plot goes through several twists, which kept me pretty entertained. It might have wandered a bit from the orignial premise of this movie, but I thought the director managed to make it flow pretty well.

The awkward relationship between the stepbrother and sister (played by the talented Satoshi Tsumabaki and the wonderful Masami Nagasawa) is gradually revealed to the audience through subtle references in the dialogue and the facial expressions of the two main characters. I myself didn't figure out their mutual feelings until about halfway through the movie. The only thing that bothered me was that because of this subtlety, I could barely see their relationship develop at all. Their chemistry though, as brother and sister, is very real and believable.

I am a huge fan of both Satoshi Tsumabaki and Masami Nagasawa, and I have to say, I think their performances here were each one of their bests. Although, I can't say much cuz I haven't seen much of Satoshi's work. Masami's character in this movie was a bit on the annoying side, but her personality shone through, and I loved seeing her develop the character throughout the movie. Satoshi's character was the typical ""overprotective brother who tries too hard"" type, but his goofy take on this character puts a nice spin on things.

I was greatly satisfied with this movie and it surprised me how entertaining and memorable it was. Usually with these kind of Japanese movies, I expect the pace of the plot and the character's relationships to be slow-moving, but accompanied with great cinematograhy. However, the characters really stood out in this movie, the dialogue was entertaining, and I was interested from the beginning to end.",1204502400,6,2354,5.012787723785166
