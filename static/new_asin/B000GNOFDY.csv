8168122,3,B000GNOFDY,"An earlier De Funes movie. It's all in French - no subtitles- unless you understand French - don't bother.

It's a light, refreshing light early comedy, but not what you would expect as De Funes in Rabbi Jacob. This is a very early movie in B&W. I don't regret buying it even though there are better De Funes movie choices.",1179532800,2,323,4.383333333333334
