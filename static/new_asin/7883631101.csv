1128375,3,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seems to be one of the most overly hyped up movies I have ever encountered.  Unfortunately that is only because the majority of people have never seen a Hong Kong Kung Fu movie in their lives.  They have never seen this style of choreography before, they are all used to Chuck Norris or Van Dam (or however you spell it).  The Chinese culture has always valued the martial arts and always glorified it in their movies.  Now the movie wasn't bad, the story was a wonderful integration of romance and action.  However two things bothered me immensly.  1) Wire control.  The fight scenes were great... until they got to flying.  The wire control in this movie was horrible, the roof chase scenes are the best example of this (as well as the bamboo forrest scene), the actors are shown flying across the roofs with almost no control at all.  You see them tripping and pumping their legs frantically trying to get a hold of a surface.  And then Michelle Yeoh even runs into a wall out of control but they quickly cut it to a scene where she's scales the wall to make up for it.  It took the excitement straight out of the movies.  2) Fight sounds... Where were they?  You hardly hear the ruffle of clothes in the wind let alone the sound of a hard hit or a solid block.  All I could hear is them breathing while they fight, we want our fight sounds! Over all I liked the movie but its not something I watch over an over again like Iron Monkey or Twin Warrior.  If you like romance, get this, if you like fight scenes get Iron Monkey or Twin Warrior or Once Upon a Time in China.",983923200,18,1604,4.3355704697986575
1128376,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the most amazing films I have seen in a long time. Not since The Matrix have I been knocked off my feet by a film. Ang Lee is a powerful director and combines the worlds of drama and martial arts gracefully.

As for the DVD, I own the Region 3 DVD and most likely the Region 1 DVD will have all, if not more, of the features from the Region 3 DVDs. The Region 3 DVD includes:

Commentary by director Ang Lee and writer James Schamus (in English)
 English (5.1), Mandarin (5.1), Thai (surround), and Cantonese (surround) audio tracks
 English, Chinese, Korean, and Thai subtitles
 Theatrical Trailer
 Featurette: A conversation w/ Michelle Yeoh
 Costumes Gallery, Behind the Scenes photos
 Coco Lee ""A Love Before Time"" music video in mandarin and english
 Talent files for Ang Lee, Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, James Schamus, and Woo-Ping Yuen

The video quality on the region 3 DVD is very good. It's anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio) and is superb looking. The print could use some cleaning and mastering, but that will probably be done for the region 1 release.",983923200,23,1115,4.730569948186528

1129023,5,7883631101,"I think this is a movie definitely worth viewing. The storyline, character development and acting are fairly decent, although it is in Chinese so you might want to watch it with subtitles. It works as a very great historical epic, because the film takes place in 19th century China and has very good production value relating to that period. It works as an action fantasy epic because some of the fight scenes seem a tad over the top. You might have to suspend some disbelief but they are just as good as any action film staring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis or Jean Claude Van Damme. If it were up to me this would've been selected for preservation in the U.S National Film Registry (if it were even eligible) and shared the Oscar for Best Picture with ""GLADIATOR"" because both movies are equally good in my opinion. When I said don't watch the English audio track, I said it because I tried watching it in English but had to switch over to the original Chinese because I thought the English was poorly dubbed.",1421452800,,1037,4.641304347826087

1129552,5,7883631101,"This movie is such pleasant surprise. The ""martial arts"" theme in this movie is not really a historical one (ie. not according to any Chinese history), but it's more in keep with the folklore and legend of martial arts theme and romance, along the line of the martial arts fictions from Jin Yong () which are beloved by generations of Chinese readers in Asia. It's great all round, from script, to directing, production, cinematography, and music score. It's a breakout performance from newcomer Ziyi Zhang. Although I'm never too fond of the high-wired fake martial art jumps in similar movies, there're enough martial arts fight scenes in this movie to feed the appetite. Michelle Yeon easily handles the fighting, but Ziyi Zhang matches Yeon respectably. I've watched this movie time and again, and I still enjoy it immensely, in particular, the beginning sequence when Yeon pursues the sword thief through the dark mansion on ground and over the roof. It's awesome.",1387238400,,969,5.024844720496894

In my opinion, a good kung fu/wuxia movie (or book) has to have these four essential ingredients: an invincible swordsman, an invincible sword, an unfullfilled love, and a restaurant brawl scene with flying chairs chopsticks and all! This movie has got them all. plus Michelle Yeoh is just incredible, both in her character as well as her martial arts prowess. All of her fight scenes are just incredible - out of this world. The scenery is breathtaking, the drum rolls etc are spectacular. There was not a better movie, nor there has been anything remotely close to it since.

The background music ~ especially via cello and drum ~ is spot-on for mood ~ without ever being overwhelming. The flowing *kung fu* and weapons action is some of the best I have seen ~ even when blended smoothly with the more surreal magical spinning, jumping and flying activity ~ and with equally good human expression, interaction and conversation. The motives and tensions are especially well-done in moderation ~ neither under or over done. I enjoyed all the main characters and actors ~ especially Chow Yun-Fat ~ and most especially Michelle Yeoh ~ who I already appreciated via another interesting movie, *Wing Chun* ~ which is also a *kung fu action* movie with some interesting angles ~ if not quite as grand as *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*.

1129691,5,7883631101,"This is a magical film and the magic of it is so purely Chinese and so purely Mental that we do not even have any problem entering it and believing it. It is the story of a very special sword from very ancient China, a sword that carries fate and destiny in it for the person who controls it, because it is not enough to own it, you must control it and when you control it, it controls you. That sword is stolen and tamed by a young woman who is to marry some nobleman though long before she was both abducted and saved by a wild young man roaming in the mountains and distant deserts, far from everything. They fell in love after much fighting.

When her marriage arrives, the young man comes to Beijing to claim the young woman but that is impossible because her father is the governor. So he manages to escape and she decides to steal the sword and to go after him. The story becomes complicated then and yet very simple. She is in love with a middle-age woman she calls her sister and who was the owner of the sword. Hence a rivalry for who will control it develops. That middle-age woman was in love with a man her age who was in  love with her but both could not go through their love for various honorable reasons, for various pledges they had taken to their masters, the woman her fighting master, the man his Buddhist spiritual master.

These two go after the escaping girl and finally find her in the hands of a witch who has drugged her. They bring her back to consciousness but the witch comes back from some errand and the fight will poison the man and the witch with the witch's poisoned darts. Then the younger woman learns from the middle-age woman where the young man she loves is and she goes there to meet him, to share her love with him one single night and then escape anew in the most Buddhist way possible by flying into the mountain mist and finding enlightenment and merging with the cosmic energy of the mountains. The young man will remain behind and mourn her forever.

A love story film with two love stories crossing and in both cases love can be at most exchanged for a very short period of time because of full dedication to a wider and deeper objective, be it the loyalty to a sword and a martial art, or be it a Buddhist pledge to reach enlightenment. In both cases attachment is impossible, love is possible but cannot become an attachment, hence a permanent relation. Everything is impermanent and has to be impermanent not to enslave the person on the way to mental and spiritual liberation.

I just wonder though if that attachment to these principles is not an excessive attachment too and hence a blocking element on the path to ""nibbana"" with a trace of Tibetan Buddhism with the middle-age man who dies in the arms of the middle-age woman he has loved all his life without ever saying so: he declares his love before dying which becomes a blocking element on the path to his liberation and he knows it and chooses at this moment to be a ghost caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead, unable to escape this state till at last a rebirth, a reincarnation makes him a man again for him to have a second chance to reach ""nibbana"", enlightenment.

The beauty of the film is in the spectacular landscapes and mountain scenery, in the extreme power of the mental and spiritual sentiments and even passions, in the depth and faithfulness of their love and their friendship, and the impossible merging of this with Buddhism and martial arts that both require a pledge to total detachment and absolute dedication to a spiritual ideal.

This film has to be enjoyed like some extreme elixir from the most refined and intense essences and liquors. Then flying will become natural and the battle in the bamboo copses or groves will be a fairy show of intemporal human luxuriance.

Ang Lee did much the same thing with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Li Mubai is everything a martial artist aspires to be - fearless, dedicated, the greatest swordsman of his day, and a master of meditation.

But it is this world - and the choices he's made - that most impact him. I won't add in spoilers.

1129798,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon(released July/00),stars,among others Chow Yun-Fat as Li Mu Bai,Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien,Zhang Ziyi as Jiao Long,Chang Chen as Luo Xiaohu,Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox and Sihung Lung as Sir Te. This is the English dubbed version of the film that won four Academy Awards in 2001,and deservedly so. It is a highly artistic,stylized fantasy film and a visual feast,with gorgeous cinematography and intricate choreography. It runs the gamut of emotions throughout from pathos to humour and back again. I thought this year,being director Ang Lee's year once more,with Life of Pi and its bevy of awards,this would be a good time to revisit one of his classic films.
The story finds Yun-Fat as a warrior who has been trying to avenge his masters death for the past 10 years,and has failed to find the culprit. He wants to turn in his famed Green Dragon sword to his friend in Beijing,Sir Te,and start to concentrate on that that he has neglected for far too long;his love for Yeoh. It is a love that has for the most part been an unspoken one. But now and throughout the film,the two start to work together and reconnect. For once the sword is in Beijing it gets taken by a local thief. While Fat makes his way on his own to Beijing to visit his friend who was given the sword,his lady love Yeoh tries,in the meantime,to get the sword back. She in fact has brief skirmishes with the thief which is traced back to the Governor's mansion. She tries to walk a fine line to get the sword back without disgracing the house of the Governor.
One night a policeman and his daughter who have tracked the thief finally confront her. However she has help. We learn the thief is the Governor's daughter and her aide is the thief's governess who is also the killer of Fat's master 10 years before,called the Jade Fox. As the fight starts going the way of the thief and the Jade Fox,Fat arrives to upset the balance,and sends them both running.
In the night a Mongol arrives in the thief's bedroom and they embrace. A back story unrolls where we see that these two have a passionate history which she has tried to forget being a woman of position. She asks him to leave and  he does. The next day during the wedding procession the Mongol interrupts things and asks that she come away with him. Fat intercedes and squirrels him away in a far off monastery,until the time is right.
The following day the thief leaves her husband and takes the sword. She is confronted by Yeoh and both have an intense fight,but she does not relinquish the sword. Fat again intercedes and pursues her to the top of a bamboo forest. Fat wins the day and throws the sword into the bottom of a waterfall. She pursues it and if it wasn't for the Jade Fox,would have died trying to get it. The Fox takes her to a cave and drugs her. She prepares poisonous darts then hides from those who will inevitably come for her. Yeoh,then Fat show up. Fat tries to detoxify the girl,then the Fox attacks. The Fox ultimately gets hers but she also has pierced the neck of Fat with a deadly dart. There is but one antidote and the girl knows how to prepare it. As she goes away to make it,Yeoh holds the dying Fat in her arms. All the lost chances and the suppressed feelings come out in her,and Fat dies professing his love for Yeoh. When the girl comes back,realizing she is too late,Yeoh tells her to go to the monastery to find her love. She makes it,spends a passionate night with him then next day throws herself off the top of the mountain.
All I can add to my opening comments is the solid acting throughout. The story of the never realized passion between Fat and Yeoh,coupled with the same theme between the thief and the Mongol,amazing. Scenes such as the fight sequence among the bamboo trees or people gliding over roof tops,simply take ones breath away. There is one thing I have always found endearing in Chinese cinema and that is the inclusion of humour. Rarely,no matter how serious a film may be,there seems to be always some type of humour injected somewhere. It is the yin and yang,the serious and the humourous;ancient Chinese philosophy.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1. There are some scenes with some graininess but generally it is clear and crisp. A good remastering would take care of this. Extras include a featurette,an interview,the trailers and commentary. This is the English dubbed version. While good I do prefer the Chinese version,with subtitles. In fact I usually do prefer to hear the original versions as a rule.
All in all a simply beautiful movie from start to finish. Director Ang Lee cleaned up at the OSCARS in 2001 with this entry as he did this year with Life of Pi. The film was obviously directed by a superb craftsman. Highly recommended.",1362096000,2,4784,4.575757575757576

1129804,5,7883631101,"Where does the power lie? In the hands or in the sword? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a 2000 film directed by Ang Lee and featured a great cast including Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and Chang Chen.  This film works on multiple different levels. It is zen, thoughtful, and mediative.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will definitely take you to a certain place and time.  The scenery and atmosphere in this film are beautiful.  The story follows a weary warrior that decides to surrender his sword.  In an act of unforgivable defiance, the sword is stolen.  This action is disrespectful and unlawful.  The sword is called ""Green Destiny.""  The robbery sets off a chain of events that revolves around a young girl that is actually a misguided master. The warrior realizes that it is his destiny to not only retrieve the sword but also redirect & train the young girl. The young master's notions are driven by rebellion and love. She is a misguided loose cannon. Throughout her struggle to keep the sword she will learn about what she truly needs: discipline & self control.  This conflict will change the fate of all parties involved and no one will walk away unscathed.  This film is about the forces of evil:  internal & external.  It is part dream & part legend. The film itself was a huge success in the US and its impact still resonates. The name ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is a translation of the Chinese proverb which refers to the hidden talents that lie beneath the surface of an otherwise normal looking individual. This film also has many hidden gems. The process of watching this film and discovering what lies beneath the surface is a worthwhile adventure to take in, consider, and enjoy.

1129970,5,7883631101,"There are scenes in this movie that are so breathtaking, so agonizingly beautiful, and so downright amazing that it's hard to believe that they could have even been conceived, much less realized on film, and with such perfection.  I can see why this film won so many major awards for ""best visuals.""  The subtle framing and depth of shots, the exquisite color, clarity, and composition, and the use of silence or the use of the haunting solo cello or the use of percussion alone, were as mesmerizing as any similar effects I have ever seen.

Sure, I know that a lot of people liked this movie mostly because of all the martial arts sequences, including the fantasy scenes where some of the characters have the ability -- because of their advanced Wudan training -- to bound through the air as if floating or flying.  To me, all of that was amusing and exciting, but secondary to the story and to the visual experience.

My main problem with the film was that I thought the opening storyline (and long-stifled romance) between Mu Bai and Shu Lien was much more interesting and compelling than the later storyline involving Jen, the young princess/spoiled brat, which is where the movie puts its primary focus.  (I know there was talk of a prequel after this film was released, for people who felt the same way as I do on this point.)

At the very beginning, for example, Mu Bai quietly confesses to his true love, Shu Lien, that his advanced meditative training did not lead him to enlightenment, but rather, unexpectedly caused him to become enveloped in an overwhelming sorrow that he could not endure.  And the defeated expression on his face at that point conveys with crystal clarity the deep emotional pain, disappointment, and despair that resulted from his philosophical training.  I wanted to hear more about that, and wanted to see less of the younger Jen and more of these two ""older"" actors, who talked and moved together with such brilliant and understated grace.

In any other film, this defect in the movie's focus would have resulted in the bestowal of fewer Amazon ""stars,"" in my boundless subjective wisdom.  But this is no ordinary film.  The visuals were so stunning that, to me, they made up for all other such defects, thus raising my ex cathedra judgment back to the full five stars.

I truly hope that this film, which was made in China with Asian actors and crew, will be studied by directors and cinematographers in the years to come.",1347667200,4,2459,4.7172897196261685

The Oscar winning cinematography and art direction were of course superb.  The Oscar winning score supported the story expertly.  I loved Michelle Yeoh, arguably the star of the film (she certainly had the most screen time and did the most with it).  The plot itself though, was a bit limited, in spite of all the talk of a sweeping romance, squared.  Two couples doomed never to be together all because of a sword, revenge, and justice: that about sums it up.  The infamous sword came and went with alarming frequency.  I kept thinking, just let the sword go, it's just a sword.  And as anyone knows, it's the one who wields it, not the sword itself, that makes it a weapon to be reckoned with.  The thief, of course, was obvious.  The ending was expected.  The fight sequences were long and repetitious (their `flying' looked more like skimming).  The abrupt desert flashback completely blocked the flow of the story up to that point.  The character of the spoiled aristocrat (Zhang Ziyi) was obnoxious, difficult to watch.  Maybe I blinked and missed it, was it ever explained why she was so desperate to have the sword?  What was her plan, other than not to be married?  For the most part that's all I did while watching this film, wonder why they were doing half the things they were, most of which felt contrived, flimsy excuses to set up another gravity defying fight sequence.

This is not your usual Bruce Lee martial arts flick, where silliness pretty much plays a dominant role in the action. Here the action scenes, as well as the dramatic scenes, are done with beautiful skill and are taken very seriously. Every single actor in this film (Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei, etc.) do an extraordinary job, while director Ang Lee tells the story with his own uniquely artistic craft. It's safe to say that I really like this movie, even if it isn't really one of my personal favorites.

1130112,1,7883631101,"I actually saw this movie in 2001.  I hadn't planned on reviewing it on Amazon until I noticed so many recent, positive reviews.  Here's my entry, to offset the imbalance created by those positive reviews:

This is the type of movie which would be best to watch on a Saturday morning when you're extremely ill and have neither the energy nor desire to find the remote so as to change channels or, get up and manually do so.

As with the Blair Witch Project, much hype accompanied this film, none of which was deserved.  The ""fight"" scenes were touted as the best ever.  What you actually get is a lot of sword and sword-like play filmed at close quarters for the most part, so that you are unable to see any artistry in the choreography. Since it is a period piece, they use reproductions of Chinese clothing from way back when so it's hard to see any action as the long robes and sleeves whirl about.

In addition to the swirling robes which obscure the action, the film is waaay too long and, it seems to employ all the old, shopworn plots used in the majority of martial arts movies:  the good guy's master is killed and his death must be avenged, there is a sacred object which has been stolen and must be recovered (in this case, it is not stolen once, but TWICE!), there are two schools of fighting - one is evil and one is good, the good guy comes across an extremely talented fighter and wants to serve as master/teacher (Hey!  If this person could kick the good guy's butt, why would this person need a teacher?), the person whom everyone thinks is a tough guy is actually a tough girl (Yo! Add some carrots to your diet - you didn't notice the arched eyebrows, soft skin and small hands on your masked toughie?).

My number one complaint (and as you can see, I have many) is the use of that stupid Matrix-like technique in the fight scenes. You know, the one where people run in mid-air and fight in mid-air and simply hang in mid-air.  It looked stupid when it was first used and now, several movies later, it looks just as lame.  We have people flying all over the place and walking among the treetops. Gimme a break!  Everything else is done on the up and up, then they want you to suspend ALL belief in gravity and reality.

The film is in Mandarin Chinese which, luckily, I am fluent in (just kidding). I have no quarrel with movies which must be ""read,"" but I DO have a quarrel with movies like this one which simply stink.

One good point: The scenery is beautiful.  The trees were especially attractive...until people started walking all over them.

1130114,5,7883631101,"This is one of the first `foreign language films' I'd ever seen, and while it didn't strike me immediately, it wore on me to the point where I now an enamored by it.  It's a truly universal and commercial film.  Everyone that I know likes it, even if they refuse to watch films with subtitles as a rule.  This seems to be everyone's exception.  I haven't seen this much universal appeal for a foreign film since, the only one coming close would have to be `Pan's Labyrinth'.

Personally, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a film that gets better with time and certainly lives up to its rich reputation.

The film is really a richly detailed amalgam of cinematic influences, each strand of the films fibers coming together effortlessly to weave an unforgettable experience.  Part epic love story, part mystery, part Asian kung-fu movie, part dramatic social commentary; Ang Lee marvelously shifts the film `ever so slightly' so as to capture everything needed to convey every thought and emotion without coming across awkward, choppy or forced.  The film has a needed `breezy' appeal that carries you from scene to scene, but it never makes light of the films weighty subject matter.

While catering towards the emotional resonance of the film (the film may be about the pursuit of a legendary sword, but the focus is not on the sword at all) Ang never forgets the films he is paying homage to, and so he beautifully renders each scene with an edge and intensity that establishes this film as one of the best martial arts pictures ever made.

Certainly the best of this past decade.

With a powerfully effective cast (both Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are Oscar worthy here), these fight sequences are elevated from brainless fun to startling emotion driven works of art.  You can understand why these battles are taking place and you can see the personalities of these characters taking shape throughout.  Ziyi is marvelous here, and her character development some of the best of the year (that character was a goldmine).  Her arrogant tonal shifts are just mesmerizing and unbelievably focused.

And let's just take a moment of silence to bask in our awe of that brilliantly choreographed bamboo tree battle (one of many breathtaking fight sequences in this film).

Yes, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a stunning film that totally lives up to the hype and delivers more and more with every viewing.  It is one of those films that I grow more and more in love with every time I watch it.  For all the edge and attitude it possesses, this film is one of the most graceful and elegant films I've ever seen.",1268611200,5,2581,4.710467706013363

Though the refined Jen is soon to be married off into respectability, she harbors a sinister plan. By night she transforms into a masked and cunning thief, out to steal the Green Destiny, an invincible blade once wielded by Li.

1130232,4,7883631101,"Chinese martial arts films had found a market in the West during the Kung Fu boom initiated by Bruce Lee in the early 1970s... But ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East... Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrifice...

Ang Lee was an astute choice as director... The location shooting was on the Chinese mainland and the actors came from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as China... Instead of the Shaolin school of martial arts favored by Bruce Lee, Ang Lee opted for the more spiritual form of Wudan; brute force is replace by scenes of balletic grace as opponents climb up walls or flit through tree-tops...

1130234,5,7883631101,"Now, I know a lot of people don't love this movie. But hear me out before you disagree.
I acknowledge that this film was made with a western audience in mind. That means that as a typical wuxia film it is watered-down by comparison. It was also apparent that they tried to do a lot with the script, probably too much, so as to please the arthouse crowd.

Because of those things I can't review it as a traditional HK film. Also, this movie was the final part in a three-part process that was absolutely critical to American cinema.

Part 1: The introduction of Jet, Jackie, Michelle, John, Chow, Tsui and Ringo to American audiences. It got them used to seeing the kung fu, the wires, and stylistic, kinetic bullet ballet.

Part 2: ""The Matrix"". ""The Matrix"" took HK choreography, wires and all, and made it mainstream acceptable. Sure, a lot of our directors tried it and failed, but at least the audience was ready for it (and even now anticipating it).

Part 3: ""Crouching Tiger"". A full Asian film, starring Asian actors, loaded with HK choreography and stylish wirework. A film that 5 years prior would have been an arthouse flick, at best, was now a mainstream, widely accepted, critically acclaimed, award winning film. This film finally made it acceptable to import more and more of HK to our shores.

Look at what has happened since this film came out. Look how many more Asian action films find their way to our theaters...and not just the little theaters. We've been given Dragon Dynasty so we can get great picture quality, no editing to our movies, subtitles that actually mean something, and extras that have translation to them. Asian re-makes are all the rage in the US. And on and on. . .

As an up and coming filmmaker who grew up watching all the great classic asian action films, it is now acceptable for me to incorporate a true HK style into my work. When I tell the studio I want to hang 2 of my actors from wires and have them fly around fighting one another, there's no fights or strange looks. Hellboy 2 was loaded with wire work. And we owe it all to CTHD.

Besides that I do enjoy the film immensely. I got a little choked-up during the first fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi when people in the theater were cheering, watching something I'd known existed for decades. Better late than never.

Wo Ping is a true artist, and CTHD gave him the talent and the leeway to create- talent and leeway that the Matrix was lacking. The visuals are spectacular. The performances are incredible. I always liken Chow to Morgan Freeman. No matter what role they play, they always bring a certain degree of respect and sophistication, with just a hint of the regal, to it.

It is a fantastic movie. And more than that, it is an important movie. No, it is not pure HK. It is watered-down and it does have its flaws. But I love it and I will always be grateful to it for the doors it opened.",1221350400,2,2911,4.477358490566037

1130450,4,7883631101,"The martial arts film traditionally has attained its own unique niche in the domain of film.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a Chinese-language film that works within the parameters of the old cliches of this niche, but changes just enough to make it stand out and create an appeal that reaches far beyond the limited circle of the average martial art film enthusiast.  It doesn't lack the action that one might expect from the typical film in this genre, but it adds something new: the soul of tragedy and romance.

An adaption of a Chinese pulp-fiction novel, the story concerns two secret lovers (the male Li Mu Bai and female Yu Shu Lien) who are warriors on a quest to recapture a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, which has been stolen by a masked bandit.  The thief turns out to be the beautiful princess Jen Yu, who is in the middle of trying to avoid an arranged marriage, because she is secretly in love with the desert bandit Lo, whom she grew to love after being abducted in the wilderness.  Behind the intrigue and romance of these two forbidden loves, lies the dark cloud of mastermind Jade Fox, the evil woman responsible for the deaths of Mu Bai's former master and of Shu Lien's fiance.  This sets the stage for a poignant drama, warm romance, and breath-taking action.

Despite being a martial arts film, the movie breaks the traditional Eastern mould by incorporating romantic elements one would expect from Hollywood.  It has well been said that stylistically, it is ""a blend of Eastern action and Western psychological drama."" I think this assessment is correct, that while on the one hand the film is clearly inspired by martial-arts mysticism and action of the East, underneath the window dressing of the foreign aspects of the film lies the romanticism and drama that one is accustomed to from the West.  By catering to what appeals to the modern Western mindset and incorporating subtle criticisms of traditional Chinese culture, it's not surprising that the film was somewhat of a flop in Asia, and that its concessions to contemporary themes of love and feelings made it a breakthrough success in the West.  Stephen Greydanus puts it well by remarking: ""Ang Lee has here crafted a masterful synthesis of various forms of Chinese mythology and Taoist philosophy that brings a broader perspective to its subject matter than many Asian films  including some aspects of more typically Western sensibilities and ideals  and, in the end, embraces a gently romantic humanism that is more life-affirming than the esoteric way of detachment and denial characteristic of Eastern thought.""  Certainly there are allusions to Taoistic mysticism, but the Taoism is in the end rejected in favor of realism and romanticism - which perhaps explains why the movie worked for Western viewers and not for Eastern ones.

The movie has also been the subject of scathing criticism for other reasons, not least from conservative Christian quarters, where offense was taken primarily to the implicit endorsement of extra-marital sexual relations, and the rebellious attitude of Jen toward her parents and her arranged marriage. For the most part, I share this concern, and it's good to be reminded of it. Watching too many movies which advocate the moral laxity of modern culture can dull sensitivity on this point, and unfortunately there aren't enough films on the other extreme to act as correctives.

But perhaps most discussion has been about the ambiguous conclusion (*spoiler warning*), where Jen leaps into the unknown.  Lo has just expressed the wish is ""to be in the desert, together [with you] again"" and then Jen jumps off the cliff into the mist of uncertainty.  If it's not suicide, what is it?  And what happens next?  We don't know.  Some have optimistically seen this as a Christological leap of faith and sacrifice with the hope of resurrection, but it seems to me that interpreting this as a message of atonement and resurrection is being too generous and overly charitable.  Perhaps the point is that we don't know the ending, and that the movie can only leave it up to us to decide for ourselves. And isn't this typical for a Western culture without absolutes?  Maybe this is a reflection of our post-modern culture more than anything.  Not only does contemporary culture delight in being morally ambiguous, but as a result it also has an ambiguous eschatology. The best that modern Western film can offer is a nebulous promise of a hope for the future. In other words, our world today doesn't really know much about the afterlife, so it can't really tell us much about it, except offer paradoxes and try to make us come up with our own happy endings. The best promise it can give is a blend of hopeless romanticism and eastern mysticism, where suicide is romanticized as an genuine escape and a leap into another world where perhaps dreams might just come true.

Despite being critical of some of these underlying themes and moral ambiguity, I have to admit that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is stimulating in raising these questions, in a way that few popular films today do.  It remains a fascinating film in what it says about a clash of cultures, and in what it says about our time.  The discerning viewer is sure to find some measure of profit and entertainment from this highly regarded and award-winning film. - GODLY GADFLY",1171497600,5,5361,4.8766519823788546

What director Ang Lee did was to take a Chinese martial arts fantasy film and add the true dramatic component so that it would appeal to all audiences.  The sets, costumes and sound track are fantastic. The movie is set in 19th-centuary China and the clothing at the beginning of the period are of the correct period, but that soon goes out the window. Though it does not detract from the movie in any way. And the casting is nothing short of phenomenal. With the great dramatic actor Chow Yun Fat staring in his first martial arts film and Michelle Yeoh bringing her acting talents from the heart. An epic movie that is sure to stand the test of time.

In this movie two warriors are faced with the duel challenge of retrieving the stolen treasured sword called the Green Destiny and dealing with their true affection for each other. The of course cannot speak of their love for one another for Yeoh's character was engaged to be married and her fianc was slain by a woman called the Jade Fox. What we must understand that in China if your fiance is killed, you are considered a widow, so they would be breaking the rules of society if they acted on their love for one another.

We then learn the young woman who stole the sword is the disciple of this Jade Fox, but also an aristocrat who is being forced into an arranged marriage of political convenience. We learn that Jade Fox has here own reasons for doing what she did out of bitterness. And we learn the true focus of the film is the young girl. With everything else going on, she is also in love with a desert bandit who she felt duty bound to leave. And once she marries she realizes she made a mistake, so she goes around getting into sword fights.

The movie express epic romance, honor and self-respect along with the martial arts wirework we expect from Chinese martial arts films.

It is, quite simply, a work of art. A masterpiece. It's fantastic.

The plot is strong, and relatively easy to follow. The acting is superb. Chow Yun Fat is great, but I'd say the real revelation of this movie is the great Michelle Yeoh. The emotion that is found in her eyes in unreal. The entire story is right there in her face. She expresses everything so beautifully and is the ultimate heroine of this movie. She's incredible. I feel that she really carries this film. The ending is fabulous, and Yeoh couldn't have done a better job.

Zhang Ziyi is also very good, and pretty young in this film. She comes off as a bit of a brat, but she redeems herself, and the chemistry between her, Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat is excellent.

All three actors really make you feel the emotion and tension, which is important, seeing as how you're reading subtitles the entire movie.

The cinematography can't be beat. It's gorgeous. Ang Lee is a master, and he proves it in this film. The fighting in the bamboo trees is unbelievable. The way the movie is shot/edited etc. seems very artsy to me, and very beautiful.

As for the stunts, well, what can we say? Michelle Yeoh herself is a master, so already you know the stunts are going to be great. People are bouncing on rooftops, flipping off of walls, jumping through the trees, swinging huge swords around, it's unreal. The stunts are pretty jaw-dropping at times, and there's no CGI involved. It's all real action with wires and all of that. It's amazing, and honestly, even if you don't like the story, it's worth it to watch for the action and the cinematography.

Joel Siegal of Good Morning America stated that this could be one of the greatest movies ever made. Joel, I'd have to agree. All in all, probably my all-time favorite movie, and most definitely my all-time favorite martial arts flick. Great story, fabulous acting, jaw-dropping stunts, it's all there. The movie has it all.

The Curmudgeon doesn't get sucked in by hype often, but I really was with this film. I read everywhere that it was basically the resurrection on film. So I bought it without ever seeing it. Last time I do that, then.

Now, OK - the fight sequences. This is all people EVER talk about in this film, so I guess I should give first mention to it. They are VERY impressive, without a hint of CGI rubbish or blue screen. They look fantastic - and it's a crying, pitiful shame they weren't in a movie of more worth.

Because let's face it - take away the jaw-dropping fighting scenes and what do you have? A dull, plodding tale of ""honour"" that's about as interesting as counting peas in a bag. And while we're on the subject, there was never any explanation as to WHY these fights were so spectacular. Ordinary village girl meets masked assassin guy, and suddenly they're running up trees and floating in the air. Did I miss something?

And how to say this without sounding racist? Hmmm.. tough call but I'll try - the director really SHOULD have tried to make the characters more distinctive. Watching ""bald guy in pyjamas fighting other bald guy in pyjamas"" can be a bit confusing. Not saying they all look the same or anything but hells bells - give one of them a hat or something.

A highly regarded warrior who defends against evil has reached a point in his life where he relinquishes his famous and feared sword, ""The Green Destiny"" to discover and explore deeper aspects of himself and life ... At some point, he had gone into a deep meditation and arrived at a place his master had never mentioned nor described. Later, his master had been murdered and the warrior could not ask him to explain this experience. He has a female protaganist who is also a warrior and accepts the solitary nature of this fighter but clearly they share strong emotional bonds. This repressed chemistry promises their paths will continually cross as they explore the depth and meaning of strong feelings throughout the film. She delivers ""the Green Destiny"" as a gift to the local magistrate/governor of the province for safe keeping. The magistrate has a daughter who is being prepared for an arranged marriage ... to consolidate the interests of two ruling families ... Hidden aspects of the daughter's character provide for unexpected adventure and romance ...

Secretly, the daugher had learned warrior skills and longed to express this independent aspect of herself ... but she lacks the personal understanding of the esoteric nature of this lifestyle. On a carriage ride with her family through the mountains and arid deserts she is captivated by an invading group of bandits, especially the leader who is young and handsome and has a mysterious reputation. He grabs her ivory hair comb as she leans fearlessly out the carriage window to watch the assualt. She unexpectedly jumps out, mounts a horse and shows remarkable skills during the chase scene ... all to retrieve back her hair comb. He captures her and takes her to his mountain cave home ... they fall in love. He tells her stories and allegories which serve to bind her even closer to him ...

The forces of evil are embodied in the form of Jade Fox who was a servant and nanny to the wealthy Chinese daughter in the past. Jade Fox had acquired a book from which she learned the warrior skills but she failed to use the skills wisely. She lashes out with vengeance at the forces of good. The author's creativity and exceptional talents come alive on the screen. The hair-pin curves and twists in the plot are executed with perfection. The ending is sadly fulfilling ... leaving the viewer breathless!

1130593,5,7883631101,"Which is more powerful? An invincible weapon or a beautiful girl?

In most Kung Fu movies, power is in one's Kung Fu skills. In the real world, however, power is in those who can control others in power.

Li Mu Bai (Chow YunFat) is a celibate monk who has devoted his life to becoming the highest warrior.  He holds the Green Destiny, a mythical sword that can make its yielder almost invincible.

Jen (Zang Ziyi) is a beautiful young girl who fascinates all men. They are willing to do anything for her, including risking death to be with her. Yet, she isn't satisified. She wants the Green Destiny to become even more powerful. She can attract or kill anyone. How exciting this must be for a young woman seeking adventure.

Despite his status as a monk and his love for Yu Shu (Michelle Yeoh), Li Mu Bai finds Jen irresisitible. He continually uses the Green Destiney as an excuse to follow Jen. He wants to make her his disciple even though his Kung Fu sect does not accept women.  ""Is it me or the sword you want?"" asks Jen.

Jen sees no need to be Li Mu Bai's disciple. Perhaps she  realizes she can control Li Mu Bai with her sexuality.

When power is in those who are selfish and reckless, the consequence can be tragic. The Green Destiny, even in the skillful hands of Jen, does not kill Li Mu Bai. But it is his fascination with Jen which kills him.",1138752000,,1358,4.357142857142857

1130733,3,7883631101,"I have seen many people praising this film as a masterpiece, and it is a good film. I would actually give it 3 and a half stars, but I had to choose either three or four, so it gets three (obviously, I don't consider it a masterpiece. For a masterpiece, you need to see some select Sammo Hung films- more on that later). I have noticed that many of the people who praise this film have never really seen any other Hong Kong style films, so I thought I would give some background on some of the things in the movie that will help them make more 'sense'.
1) The flying- Hong Kong martial arts films have a LOT of wirework these days, and even back before wires were used extensively, martial artists were depicted as doing things that Americans would consider ridiculous (like skimming across the surface of a lake by running fast, or jumping over a 40 foot wall). This is totally accepted in Hong Kong cinema, its not that they think it could really be done, its just part of their film culture to accept these feats as normal in a kung fu movie.
2) The importance of the sword and the training manual- Seeking a special weapon or training manual to defeat the movie's villian is a plotline that has been used countless times in Hong Kong kung fu movies. Again, its part of the film culture, really. Obviously, you aren't expected to reason it through (like, ""how could she learn kung fu that good just from a book?""). Just accept it.
3) The tragedy- HK kung fu films have a long history of incorporating sacrifice and tragedy into their main themes. The Chinese kung fu hero is supposed to be self-sacrificing, putting their own happiness second to everyone else's. Even more importantly, their sense of honor (different from the American idea of honor) must come first, not their own happiness. Americans like their heroes brash and mouthy, the Chinese like them noble and sacrificing.

  A few more points. NONE of the actors (with the exception of Michelle Yeoh) have any kung fu training. Chow Yun Fat did mostly gunplay movies, and Zhang Ziyi has a dance background. This is the reason for the extreme editing during the fight scenes- its to cover for the skills weakness of the actors. This is a trend in modern Hong Kong- where martial art movies used to have real martial artists in them, now they have boy-band members with NO martial arts training in them. Not a good thing.
  Jade Fox is played by Chang Pei Pei, a legendary Hong Kong actress who appeared in many swordplay films in the '60's (Incidently, she also had no kung fu training).
  There is no comedy in this film. The vast majority of Hong Kong kung fu movies contain comedy, it just depends on how much. We are talking really stupid slapstick lame humor, simply because that is what Chinese audiences tend to prefer. Thankfully, Crouching Tiger avoided any silliness and focused on the drama.
  Many kung fu styles are named after animals (Crane style, Mantis style, Monkey style), and this plays a large part in Chinese martial art lore. Referencing animals to describe martial artists (ie- Bruce Lee = ""Little Dragon"") and situations in the Chinese martial arts world is common, and the title of the movie should make more sense if you understand that.
  One final point is the concept of the ""boxer's world"" or the 'martial arts world' in Hong Kong cinema ('boxer' is the closest word to what the Chinese use to describe a martial arts practitioner). The 'boxer's world' concept doesn't have a Western equivilent concept, and is a little hard to describe. Its basically that if you devote your whole life to martial arts and the pursuit of perfection in it, you have no time for 'real world' type of living. Its almost as if you have two different worlds coexisting: the regular world where the regular people exist, and the boxer's world, where the serious martial artists exist. In addition, all boxers wish to be the best, and challenge each other to secure a position in the heirarchy of the boxer's world. In Crouching Tiger, Chow Yun Fat's character is a boxer trying to quietly retire from the boxer's world.
  If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger, I would urge you to explore kung fu cinema further. It is generally excepted that the best kung fu movies were produced in Hong Kong during the late '70's and very early '80's. If you are interested in viewing an old school kung fu movie (no real wirework, REAL martial artists, INCREDIBLE kung fu choreography and nice long takes (not choppy MTV-style editing to cover lack of fighting skills), I would recommend you pick up Warriors Two, starring Sammo Hung. This is one of the BEST kung fu movies ever made, and it is available through Amazon (it is distributed by Fox) and is VERY affordable. Just one word of warning, there is some humor in this movie (Sammo never made one without humor), but it is minimal by Hong Kong standards, and doesn't get in the way of the story and the incredible kung fu action.",1134432000,6,4938,4.6168757126567845
1130734,3,7883631101,"I have heard of this film for so long i finally decided to buy it and left with a distinct feeling that
the people who praise it so much are either (1)Overhyped, and just excited to see something re-introduced
into the mainstream audiences. or (2) Easilly excited and are the ones who created all the hype. or Lastly
(3) Cough* Cough* just exited to see Zhang Ziyi, a pretty girl no arguments there.. put down your swords
guys.

This film has many many mistakes in it and im sure even the Director feels the same way looking back.
I thought the casting was great and i don't think this film was horrible or even really bad but i don't even
think It's classic or even Great, neither is it any kind of masterpice. The people who are saying this are
easilly impressed.

Let me break it down for you :

1) Chow Yun Fat looks like hes about 100 pounds overweight in this film, the style of clothing did not help
this at all. His fighting skill were never really even shown, it was all slight of hand fancy camera angles
and whatever to make up for the fact that he is just an actor in real life. In fact the truth is he hardly
show up in the film, the only thing we do know is his name was ""Li mu bai!"" If his reputation proceded him
it was only spoken of it was never shown. If the term ""His Reputation Proceeds him"" was ever meant to fit
anywhere its here.

2) The fight scenes where they are climbing all over the rooftops and trees.. Flying from tree to tree im not
trying to argue against the idea. But the Wire Work, (actors attached to wires for flips jumps, etc) was just
ended up looking so sloppy that it ended up looking silly. If you like it. Fine im not trying to steal your
eggo.. but let of MINE, because the wire work was really sloppy overall.
I mean you cant CLIMB OVER AIR, rooftops yes but if your walking over a roof and making step after step at
least make it LOOK like your feet are hitting something.

3) Thirdly the storyline was not bad but you mean to tell me this girl played by Zhang Ziyi was able to fight
that good from a manual, from which even as they state in the movie that she only knew half of it and what
she knew was dangerous to her? Chow yun fats wish seemed to be MORE or less of having a HARD ON for
teaching Zhang Ziyi ... even more than approaching his love interest.

Lets face it Zhang Ziyi is the only thing good about this film besides the idea of The Jade Fox, the person who
played Chow Yun Fats love interest Michelle something was GREAT for the part. But what they never even
touched, i mean they didn't even hug. He chases Zhang Ziyi more than his love interest.
And it takes focus even though it
was not supposed to be the point. Its a faulty script i couldn't believe it. I don't hate it but it was really
just above average and is good. Do you know how many great martial arts movies have already been made?
I did like it but it does not live up to the HYPE for me at all.

The story ends before you know it everyone you want to live dies, its just ridiculously faulty. If i say this
then how can the film critics praise it so highly you ask.. Jesus Christ if you don't know its all about Zhang
Ziyi by now THEN you might not ever.

She is so lucsious, my baby, my precious, oh yes my preciousssss. Oh my little baby girl. Shuffle Shuffle.......
Hey woah oops! Are you still here? Im so embarrased.

Anyways even though she is my girlfreind Zhang Ziyi i would rather reccomend The New Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon at least we got to stay with the characters and get to know them become confortable with them as well
as the story in that 2 disc film. Its way more fleshed out.

""Make popcorn now."" Excuse me honey? ""Make Popcorn now!""

Ok thats my que MY GIRLFRIEND Zhang Ziyi is calling me i better go before she gets jealous and chops of my
head with the green desitiny sword or drop kicks me.

way more developed, fautly yes but at least it wasn't like the original where we step into the movie theatre you
blink and then its over.",1130976000,4,4098,4.166877370417193

Together, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh provide a terrific performance which focuses on love, honor, and devotion. The tale is both simple and complex. The story revolves around a sword called the Green Destiny. This weapon's strength is as well known as its owner: the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). When this sword is stolen by an anonymous skilled fighter, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lein (Michelle Yeoh) track down the thief only to discover that the rogue is actually the daughter of a high ranking Beijing official with a very unique past of her own. Overarching all of this is Li Mu Bai's quest to avenge his fallen master, killed at the hands of a wicked sorcerous named Jade Fox.

While the story does revolve around a sword: the Green Destiny, the focus is on the nature of power, the danger of reckless use of power, and the need for discipline to obtain true strength.

The cinematography sets a strong mood for the film with overtly fantastical martial arts that is both a joy to watch and is yet another way in which the film stresses it's main points. Points which are narrowed down fairly succintly in a quote by Li Mu Bai:

""No growth without assistance. No action without reaction. No desire without restraint""

A simply superb soundtrack overlays the film which is orchestrated by the great Yo Yo Mah. The music acts adds not only to the dramatic moments of the scene, but carries the viewer along during the more leisurely transitional moments of the film. I highly recommend not only the movie, but also this soundtrack.

I can not stress this enough: Buy this movie. The story is great, the environment is rich, the music is superb, and the acting is superb. You'll rarely find a gem that will shine brighter in your collection.",1130284800,3,2007,4.72

you better believe it!

i'm as strong a movie buff you can find. i normally watch anywhere between 15 to 20 movies a month - hollywood to foreign. and CTHD is easily one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. this movie has so much depth in it that you simply cannot comprehend its depth over a single viewing. you've to see it multiple times. there're so many things to understand and appreciate here. ang lee's labour of love for sure.

i first saw this movie in london in the year 2001. the first time i clearly enjoyed it but didn't perceive any special greatness. but over the last 4 years i've seen it atleast 15 to 20 times and with each viewing the exquisite details in this work of art have slowly unfolded.

the greatness in this movie doesnt merely lie in its remarkable photography of such beautiful locales or the brilliantly choreographed action sequences or stirring music (all of which are fantastic in themselves) - but in the emotional depth that lee is able to mine out of the characters.

the story is about a rich albeit troubled girl who is secretly tutored in martial arts by an outlaw called jade fox who's posing as a nurse/tutor. jade fox has multiple people on her trail each seeking to avenge several murders by the former. one of these people is li mu bai (chow yun fat) considered the greatest swordsman alive (in that time and space) whose martial arts master was murdered by jade fox. fox decamps with a secret manual and takes up the position of the nurse of the rich young girl jen and secretly tutors her in the martial arts. growing up jen being highly talented soon outstrips her teacher in fighting skills though hides her talent from her teacher so as to not offend/hurt her feelings.

jen's father is a governor and in her travels with him she meets and falls in love with a desert bandit, but still leaves him and returns home to her parents.

li mu bai tired of fighting gives his famed sword the green destiny to yu (michelle yeoh) who inturn is supposed to give it to an old friend for safe keeping. but jen sees the beauty and power of sword and steals it one night.

thus li mu bai enters the scene and slowly all the characters are brought together into the play.

the greatness of the movie lies in subtlety of the expression of emotional depth between all the actors - the despair of jen against the tradition which she considers stifling, her unattainable love, the forbidden love between yu and li, the troubled teacher-student relationship between jen and jade fox and between jen and li, rivalries and jealousy between jen and yu - the emotional intricacies are mined to their full potential in all these relationships.

two of the scenes which struck me are :

1. when jen goes after the bandit (soon to be lover) who has stolen her comb and her unexplainable frustration and angst in her relationship with him is suddenly ended when he puts his hand into her pants! (remakable scene - believe me)!

2. when jen fights li mu bai (who wants to teach and guide her) there's a scene when he tells her that she's undisciplined and should first learn to hold the sword in stillness and suddenly slashes his sword staggering her, saying that expertise should come without effort! typical zen (in contrast to the undignified foolery of yoda in the climax fight against count dooku in the attack of the clones)!

1130852,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger is a very good film with a lot going for it.  The recreation of mid-evil China, the cinematography, the gorgeous fight choreograpy, a sweeping story and its focus on the role of women in society and the cultural expectations that are placed on them all add up to a fine film.  But above all else it is the film's acting that makes it stand apart from the crowd, particularly the performances of its two leading ladies.

Michelle Yeoh is amazing in this movie.  Loyal and hard edged, Yeoh's character is the ultimate example of internal conflict, torn between a friendship and the truth, and between a deep respect and an even deeper love.  There are several scenes where the subleties of her facial expressions say more than most actors manage in their entire careers with actual dialogue.

As good as Yeoh is, its newcommer (at the time this film was made) Zhang Ziyi that steals the show.  Never mind that a good argument could be made for her as the most beautiful actress alive today,  Ziyi manages to portray Jen as a complex duality of fragility and power, of nobleman's daughter and thief. At times bratty and spoiled, at other times indigent, self-assured and cocky, and at all times someone who will, in the end, do what she pleases to do, cultural expectations, protocol, laws and even common decency be damned.  Jen wants the world, but she'll only accept it on her own terms.

Even though the DVD defaults to english, I recommend watching the film first in its native Mandarin with the english subtitles turned on, as the film was presented during its theatrical release.  Too much of the subleties of these great performances are lost when the english audio is dubbed in.  At the same time, it is worth watching later with the english audio, as the spoken english words are more elaborate and convey more than the much briefer subtitles can.

I would also like to briefly comment on the use of wirework in the movie and the widespread criticism it has received for making the movie unrealistic.

First, please realise that the movie is meant as a fairy tale / fantasy.  It was not intended to be fully realistic.  If you realise this, and allow yourself to enjoy the movie, you will.  Just as we allow ourselves to enjoy films like Kill Bill, Rambo, and James Bond, even though they too have fight scenes that are completely unrealistic and would in reality leave the participants chalk full of bullet holes or beaten to bloody pulps.

Second, there is something of a point as to why the characters can fly.  Yeoh hits the nail on the head in the accompanying documentary on the DVD when she points out that the flying is meant to be symbolic of the character's relative freedom from social obligation.  Yeoh's character, who runs a business and cannot speak her love for Li Mu Bai due to social standing, is also the least adept flyer of the major characters and often struggles to do so, weighed down by her obligations.  Jen certainly has social expectations placed upon her, but has escaped most of them through her secret life.  She is able to take flight far more easily than Yeoh's character.  Finally, Li Mu Bai is a warrior who is at peace with who he is - he flies most effortlessly of all three of them.",1123200000,3,3243,4.611498257839721

I don't know what kind of movies these other reviewers have been studying (and I say studying not watching because they must be too involved trying to figure out if the area under the curve of the roof on the buildings is sufficient to support the snow) but, the fight scene in the temple has got to be one of the best I have ever seen. Beautiful acrobatics, graceful strikes and fast-paced edge-of-your-seat action meld seemlessly into a true masterpiece of martial combat.  The only thing that keeps this movie from earning five stars is the overly-dramatic, overly-long, and completely pointless desert love affair. I skip these scenes when I come to them. Other than this, the movie is a true masterpiece of FICTIONAL ENTERTAINMENT that was never meant to, nor ever promised to, obey the mundane and drol laws of physics.

Winner of four Oscars, including Best Foreign Film, the movie is an epic tale, reminiscent of greek tragedies and sweeping romantic movies.  The fight scenes are unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking.

  I find it very revolting that people across the world can take their time to understand and appreciate Western culture, and subsequently enjoy our films. But, some of us, on the other hand, could be so ignorant. Making a comparison between Hidden Tiger and Indiana Jones, or Peter Pan is simply absurd. While Western culture is generally more outspoken and straightforward, old Eastern culture is generally more reserved and very subtle and delicate. That is the reason why even fighting can be so beautiful that it's a form of arts.  That kind of explains the final scene too. In the old days, Chinese often oppressed their feelings and any breach of cultural norms was deemed a major problem... what more being rebellious.

  Some find the flying scenes to be ridiculous. Hello~ this is not supposed to be a non-fiction film. In many Chinese martial arts novels, people can do many other extraodinary stunts.

  I'm very glad that US has been such a developed country as it is right now. However, the down side is more and more people are getting lazier (due to higher standards of living) and you can always find many of us would just brainlessly point out that this is stupid, that is stupid.

1130980,5,7883631101,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" may be the most galvanizing film in the history of martial arts cinema.  It is, claims the ""old skool"" core of fans that make up the base of support for the industry, a complete sell-out, relying on large-scale production values and special effects rather than legitimate fighting skills of the actors (with the notable exception of veteran martial arts female lead Michelle Yeoh) in order to sell itself; it is an act of sound and fury , signifying nothing.

To the vast bulk of the filmgoing public who wouldn't know ""Drunken Master"" from ""The Master Of The Flying Guillotine"" from ""The Five Masters Of Death"" from ""The Five Deadly Venoms"", that criticism meant...well, nothing at all.  What is obvious from the first scene of this movie is that the director of this movie has fashioned a labor of love that has resulted in one of the most beautifully filmed movies in the history of cinema, regardless of genre.

Martial arts film purists seem to revel within the primative nature of the films that temd to define that genre.  Poor acting, shallow scripts, ABYSSMAL overdubs, hack-and-slash editing...these are not the hallmarks of classically revered movies.  Yet they seem to do more to define martial arts cinema than any other characteristic save that of the action itself.  Yet ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" does not want for action.  The combat scenes (particularly those involving Michelle Yeoh; Ang Lee definitely knew his most talented fighter and exploited her abilities to the max) are extraordinary, special-effects laden or not.  The TRIUMPH of this movie is that is sees fit to actually present a story that draws the viewer in, that allows the viewer to form an opinion about the characters in between fight scenes...as opposed to just wishing that we could ""fast-forward"" to the next combat sequence.

What we have is a film more suited to the Classical Age, the Greek Tragedy with better fight choreography.  The levity and sense of comic relief that could be expected with a number of Hong Kong cinema classics (and basically every Jackie Chan film ever made) is lacking here, but it is not missed as it has no place.  Themes such as honor, social expectations, unrequited love (from unexpected sources), revenge (this is a kung fu movie, after all)...portrayed in an unconventional environment in an unusual setting (for Western audiences) make this an intriguing movie that has the bonus of some drop-dead action sequences that most people lacking a background in Hong Kong cinema are going to find quite amazing.

The acting is quite impressive.  You will want to watch the Mandarin soundtrack with subtitles for the full appreciation of the effect (particularly taking into effect that the Hong Kong/Canton-based actors do not speak it normally); Chow Yun-Fat is best known for his ""gun fu"" movies made with John Woo, but the depth of his performance in this movie led to his casting opposite Jodie Foster in a non-musical remake of ""The King And I"".  Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zhi-yi (was she REALLY only a teenager when this movie was made???) are amazing and wonderfully strong female roles that aren't typically seen in Hong Kong cinema (clearly a male-dominated genre).  Some people have called this movie the best chick flick since ""Thelma and Louise"", but anyone who would classify either movie in such strictly gender-limiting terms displays an ignorance which must prove to be quite burdensome and suffocatingly limiting.  This is a terrific movie, transcending both genre and gender.  It is the martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies.  It took home Oscars that neither Bruce Lee nor Jackie Chan will ever see.  It is, simply speaking, what going to the movies is supposed to be all about.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're absolutely cheating yourself.",1101081600,17,3849,5.001567398119122
1130981,5,7883631101,"I agree that the popularity and artistic merit of this movie is somewhat controversial.

I watched this first time around in its original Chinese version with subtitles (Like all other dubbed movies, dubbed version tends to destroy the movie)

I think this is one of the best martial arts movie made, as well as erotic (I don't mean that in the sense of porn or anything. Yun Fat Chow and ZHang Ziyi's fight scene in the forest near the end was one of the scenes that I thought was very memorable..)

It is not a typical Hollywood comedy-martial arts film like Rush Hour or anything, but I think the director did a fantastic job with this film.

1130982,1,7883631101,"Between the laughable fight scenes and the incomprehensible plot, it's a puzzle to me why ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has received so much praise. The scenery and costumes are beautiful, but that's all I liked about the film.

Li Mubai is going through a period of soul searching, involving his time in a monastery, his master's unavenged murder at the hands of Jade Fox, and his love for his friend. He gives up his sword and his friend takes it to a lord in Beijing for safekeeping. The sword then is stolen by a mysterious figure in black, and that's the point at which I started to get lost. There's the translation gap and the cultural gap, and beyond that there's bad story-telling. Li Mubai, his friend, the villain, Jade Fox, the outlaw Black Cloud, and a bunch of other people whose identities I couldn't figure out, run around hunting the sword and each other in obscure places. Lengthy flashbacks intrude to disrupt what little story there is. The main characters' motivations, particularly the villain's, are never made clear. The final scene was incomprehensible.

I like a realistic fight scene, but a girl who taught herself swordplay out of a book beating all comers and then running away over water? I can't suspend my disbelief that far. I'm perfectly willing to admit there's a lot I wasn't picking up in this film, but between the obscurities of the plot and the action scenes that were so ridiculous as to be boring, I didn't find much to hold my attention. I just kept watching out of puzzlement and sheer disbelief.",1095120000,5,1543,4.732342007434944

While a lot of people downgraded this movie, some of the greatest writers have never been understood in their own country. This includes writers such as Nadine Gordimer, Coetzee and so on. So the chinese not liking it is not an end all. People saying that Rush Hour is better than this shows how little they understand the movie. This is more than a martial arts movie, it combines martial arts, fantasy and medieval storyline into a well crafted story. Though the storyline is thin, it is well done. Chou Yun Fat does a fantastic job in his role. As for people saying that it shows people living in lavish lifestyle while China has so much poverty, well this is not about this century. China had one of the best civilizations and a lot of in those times like governers could live well. It is sad that people do not understand fantasy.

The three lead actors (Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi) are all brilliant in their roles. The costumes and settings are stunningly beautiful, and the special effects add magic to the story telling - which is quite different from special effects that are all there is to a story.

The beauty of this production is so prodigious that even if beauty, along with the element of fantasy, were all there is this would be a satisfying and very worthwhile film - but there is more, and what is more adds depth to the tale.

There is the allegorical element to which I referred; mortals trying to become god-like.  This is the allegory of original sin.

The heroes in this movie are god-like beings who possess a great wisdom - a wisdom that is properly understood and held by only a select few.  It is not a power to be accessible to everyone, because only those of great goodness can be trusted with it.  It certainly is not to be obtained by shortcut.  It is the solemn and sacred duty of the good to resist the attempts of evil to gain this power. This is a timeless tale of the human experience, older than the Judeo-Christian tradition.

1130988,3,7883631101,"The only thing distinguishing this film from your average ""D"" quality Hong Kong kung-fu film is the state-of-the-art cinemtography and slightly above average directing. Apart from that, the screenplay is whimsical, the acting dull and shallow, and the script is inundated with those generic Confucian/Dao proverbs already overused in the 70's Kung-Fu series with David Caradine.

 Yes, Chinese kung-fu cinema often has the characters floating in the air or doing other motions that defy the limitations of physics: this reflects their notion of how the channeling of chi through mental and physical concentration can overcome natural laws. Although I'm not disturbed with such reality gaps in film, I don't see why it would be worthy of an Oscar or the amount of praise it received. The screenplay presents a story that is just as absurd as the one for Rambo II where Rambo bravely defeats an entire entire North Vietnamese regiment using just a knife. Rambo II wasn't Oscar material and wouldn't have been Oscar material even if it had a better script, an added love story and enhanced cinematography: Why? Because the story line is generic and unimaginative. The same goes for Crouching Tiger: the story is essentially no different than every other generic kung-fu film coming out of Hong Kong. This is not to say that there aren't any good films coming out of China but, kung-fu films are essentially the Chinese equivalent of our Shwarzenneger or Stallone films. Have either of the latter actors or their action films won Oscars? No. So why should Crouching Tiger: just because it's foreign?

 Check out 'Red Firecraker, Green Firecracker', 'Farewell My Concubine', and/or 'Raise The Red Lantern' for good Chinese drama; not this overhyped and revamped generic kung-fu fiasco.",1091059200,4,1780,5.14878892733564

So prepare to throw Jack Chan in the trash bin as you watch Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi battle it out in the mountains (a girl who chases down a bandit who stole her comb--who knew this would end up in romance?). And even though the action was choreographed by the same guy, CTHD's fighting sequences kick the butt of Iron Monkey's. The finest example of this are the fights that take place between Zhang Ziyi (Jen) and Michelle Yeoh (Shu Lien), in Yeoh's house and on the rooftops of China.

Crouching Tiger has a story that will get you so involved, you'd rather wet your pants than have to stop it to visit the restroom (trust me; I'd know--only the ending credits came just in time for me to run to the bathroom w/out embarassing myself).

Amazing fights, a simple yet wonderfully written story, and beautiful landscapes keep you loving every minute.

 Let's be honest, you watch this movie for the fast-paced high- flying ass whoopin's, right? This movie has one of the best one on one hand to hand fight scenes and one of the best sword fight scenes ever, and did I mention they are both between two women! That's what I said, WOMEN!! Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are both beautiful and deadly. Every time I watch this movie I am in awe of their skill and performance.

Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are perfectly cast as lovers who are united by their past yet forbidden to act on that love by their code of honor.  These talented actors say all there is to say with meaningful glances, conveying their mixed emotions of desire and regret.  (The dialogue is also surprisingly good for a ""kung fu flick,"" but is much more effective in Chinese with Engish sub-titles rather than dubbed in English.)
Still, this movie is first and foremost a martial arts film -- albeit one with a heck of a love story.  Two fight scenes in particular - an early one at night in a courtyard and a later scene in a sparring room - steal the entire movie.  World-class athleticism combined with astounding choreography and a heart-pounding soundtrack -- sheer bliss!
""Crouching Tiger"" gives us heroes to cheer, villains to hiss, and colorful sidekicks to make us smile.  Put this all together with stunning camerawork and a heart-breaking climax, and you've got yourself one heck of a picture!

The fight sequences could be ridiculous and childish, still director Ang Lee injects a sense of style and beauty in most of them and achieves something unique. This is a well-crafted story that manages to be compelling and thought-provoking. It`s also a good alternative to most Hollywood full around, presenting something that tries to innovate and deliver a somewhat surprising achievement.

As a martial arts fan, I suppose I was afraid that the actual martial arts action would play second fiddle to both the storyline and the sweeping cinematography.  I needn't have worried because not only is the fighting fast and furious, it involves a style of fighting and use of assorted weapons that aren't typically featured in most of the films I am acquainted with.  The Wutan school of fighting and philosophy holds sway over these characters, making for some of the smoothest and most impressive moves I've ever seen.  The story itself is exciting and compelling, working its themes of duty, maturity, passion, romance, and tragedy flawlessly into the presentation.  The film even managed to be quite unpredictable, and the surprise I felt at the end only added to the emotional effects of the conclusion.
Chow Yun-Fat gives a masterful performance as Master Li Mu Bai in this, his first martial arts role.  Michelle Yeoh is equally brilliant as Yu Shu Lien, Li's ally, friend, and true love.  Yu is the heart, Li the soul of this story.  The most impressive and most important performance, though, comes from young Ziyi Zhang; she is simply incredible and brings energy of the rarest form to the big screen in her performance as Jen Yu, a young aristocratic lady with unmatched charms and skills.  A number of dramatic subplots weave a tapestry of magnificent wonders in this martial arts fantasy.  Even I initially questioned the gravity-defying abilities of the characters, but as you watch the film you realize that Ang Lee has in fact given us a work of fantasy, and I can't deny the majesty and rare beauty that the incredible wire work adds to the cinematography.  Of course, the most impressive scenes are the fight scenes.  You don't see a lot of swordplay in martial arts films, but here you have swords, curved knives, poles, and all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons in play.  The actors worked very hard in order to make their performances as realistic as possible, and it shows.
While gorgeous, dramatic, and awe-inspiring, this is not a perfect movie.  There is one important flashback in the film that lasts entirely too long, in my opinion, and a second viewing raised a number of questions in my head, particularly in regard to the Wutan traitor and murderess Jade Fox.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, though, a unique motion picture experience, and it has some of the most distinguished cinematography, special effects, and accompanying music ever to grace the silver screen.  The DVD extras are nice, although I was disappointed to find no interviews with Zhang Ziyi included, and I personally gave up on the commentary half-way through because it did not feature a very serious discussion.  This is basically a martial arts film that everyone can enjoy, and the experience is not one you will soon forget.",1079222400,3,2920,4.866666666666666
1131189,5,7883631101,"With 10 Oscar nominations, that would certainly be enough to intrigue the average viewer, but it could be argued that this should have been the first film in history to win both Best Foreign Film and Best Picture.  Everyone I know who has seen this sparkling film and the film ""Gladiator,"" which took home the Best Picture award, give a unanimous gasp at how that could have possibly happened.  The cinematography in this film is lush and just plain gorgeous!  The costumes are intricate and beautiful!  While the story is great fantasy laced with fantastic fight-choreography with many different weapons, not to mention hand-to-hand combat, and has an emotional depth not seen in most foreign films.  This is simply a great film!  Many are turned off by the ""Peter Pan"" fantasy elements of this extraodinary folk-tale, but I loved every moment, feeling like ""if that's going to be possible in this movie, then anything could be.""

1131190,5,7883631101,"In the early 70s, many TV stations carried ""Kung Fu Theater"" by one name or another.  Because of the fascination with Bruce Lee and TV series, ""Kung Fu,"" movies were being ground out by the dozens, much as the Hercules movies were in the 1950s.  Some of the martial arts movies were interesting or downright silly.  But they were almost always fun.
""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a delightful homage to those earlier movies.  Beautifully filmed, it presents some of the most fantastic (in every sense) fight scenes ever filmed.  In addition, the plot includes two love affairs, one young and consummated, the other older and platonic.
The action begins when Li Mu Bai returns from meditating in the mountains with his sword, the Green Destiny, whose blade has ended many lives.  Mu Bai wishes to give up the life of a warrior for a more contemplative existence.  He gives the sword to the woman he loves, Yui Shu Lien, fiance of his best friend who died many years earlier.  Shu Lien, a warrior in her own right, delivers the sword to Sir Te, a powerful friend in the capital, for its safe keeping.  That very night the magical sword is stolen.
Enter Jen, the daughter of the new governor Yu, a passionate young woman on the verge of marriage, dissatisfied with the path set for her by her father.  She longs for the bandit Lo, with whom she spent many days and nights in the Gobi Desert.  And lurking somewhere behind them all is Jade Fox, the woman who taught herself the skills of a warrior usually denied to women.  It was she who murdered Mu Bai's master and for whom he has searched in vain for many years.
All of these characters come together in tragedy and longing and hate.  Yet, at the center of much of the story lurks the sense of humor one usually finds in Kung Fu movies.  The impossible flying, running from roof to roof, walking up and down bamboo trees and walls, all part of the flights of fancy.  The skills of the actors are serious.  For those of us who remember the old movies, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is great fun and might bring fond memories.  For those too young to remember, this is a fun introduction to the genre of movies.",1075075200,3,2167,4.515384615384615

1131192,5,7883631101,"Anyone in the U.S. who has heard of this movie but hasn't seen it yet probably knows of it for one of two reasons: Ang Lee and Yuen Wo Ping.
Those are two very good reasons. Director Lee, of course, has gotten some attention lately for his work on the film version of Marvel's _The Hulk_ (which I think is an excellent, excellent film as well as a true-to-spirit screen adaptation of the original Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic-book series). And Yuen, of martial-arts-choreography fame, is especially well known for his brilliant work on the Wachowski brothers' _Matrix_ series (which are among my personal favorite movies ever).
If you like their work on those other films, you'll love seeing what they can do together. _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ is a triumph in every respect.
The cinematography is, in the literal sense of the word, spectacular. This is one of those movies that you can pause at _any_ frame and see an artfully constructed composition -- the lights and shadows, the colors, the placement of the human figures. And of course the Chinese scenery is magnificent. (Lee, who is from Taiwan and resides in New York, got special permission from the government of China to film his movie there.)
The martial-arts scenes, choreographed by Yuen, are more real than reality. If you haven't moved like this in your dreams, I don't envy you your dreams. Physical bodies may not move like this, but minds do.
And actually, 'choreographed' is a good description of _all_ the movement in the film, both physical and dramatic. The film (based on the novel of the same name) incorporates elements of Hong Kong wuxia films but takes up these elements into a higher and deeper synthesis. The plot ostensibly centers on the theft of a sword called the 'Green Destiny' by the mysterious outlaw known as Jade Fox (sort of a Chinese Zorro). But in addition to the intrigue and the undeniably cool martial-arts stuff, there are two romances, a whole lot of philosophical/spiritual tug-of-war in the subtext, and some sly, subtle, and subversive questioning of tradition, all of it rolled up into one big thematic package. And -- I'm not exaggerating here -- _every_ 'movement' in the film participates in its Taoist-spirited thematic development.
I could comment at length on the actors, but I'll restrict myself here to admiring the work of actress/martial artist Michelle Yeoh. I'm sure people in other parts of the world have known of her for some years, but (like many others here in the U.S.) I first saw her in _Tomorrow Never Dies_ and she was easily my favorite part of the movie. (For this film, incidentally, she had to learn to speak Mandarin. I'm certainly not the person to judge her performance in that respect, but people who know the language have said that she did her job well.) She's well paired with Chow Yun Fat (who here sports a funky Manchu hairdo). I'll also mention Tan Dun's captivating soundtrack.
The DVD has some nifty special features (including a commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus, a making-of documentary, and a conversation with Yeoh), but the best part is the set of options on the audio portion of the movie itself. If you want to listen to it in Mandarin and hear the actors' original voices, you'll find the English subtitles quite sufficient. And if you want to listen to it in English, you'll find that the vocal overdubs are _so_ well done that you may not even notice that they're overdubs. Somebody took extra-special care with this stuff.
This is a nice package all around, with something for everybody who appreciates fine filmmaking. Don't miss it.",1074297600,7,3596,4.829821717990275

1131195,4,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a rare example of a film that attempts and successfully transcends its genre. The picture is filled with the conventions of the martial arts picture, but it adds visual poetry and effective drama to the mix. All the standard scenes of a martial arts pictures are there from the avenging the death of the master to the big brawl in the two level tavern. Lee's drama sometimes passes into heavy melodrama, but is mostly very effective. It is important to note that the film was made as a fantasy and Lee points out on the supplements.
A lot happens in Crouching Tiger's two hours and there are many moments that are memorable. Lee's drama doesn't push the action scenes out of the way, there is a brutal multi weapon showdown between Ziyi and Yeoh and a rousing wire-fu hand to hand sequence. Tan Dun's score drives the action and intensifying the emotions appropriately. The on location footage and stunning sets make for gorious images. The only problem with the structure of the film is an awkward transition in the middle of the narrative that suddenly shifts to an extended flashback scene in the desert. This shift is bad but the scene is one of the film's highlights as Ziyi pursues the charming desert bandit Chen. Chen's Lo character looks a lot like the prototype for Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribean. All in all the film succeeds on many levels and holds up after several viewings.
Film 5 out of 5.
The Sony Dvd of Crouching Tiger offers a few worthwhile extras, but presents a slighly flawed video. The images is suprisingly shimmer free in the tree scenes, but seemed soft especially in the first half of the film. White specks were quite noticable in dark scenes, for such a recent movie I was surprised the print was not cleaned more carefully. Presented in 2:35:1 ratio the subs are low into the black, so 16X9 tvs beware. The audio is excellent with strong voice and effects. Music and bass come out on good levels making an excellent audio experience.
Extras have an audio commentary with Lee and co-writer Schamus. The talk is relaxed because they are long time collaborators and Schamus helps to drive the talk along by questioning Lee. Unfortunately Schamus's smug comments on the film drag down interest in the commentary. Eventually he becomes tiresome and  annoying and it probably isn't worth listening to the whole thing. There is a long interview with Yeoh, but she talks solely about the project from her perspective and her own career. Fans of hers will like it, but others may find it rather one track. Surprisingly she speaks very little Manadarin and was really challenged to perform the dialogue. The Bravo special is much better because it provides her comments with Lee's to give a full picture to the ideas surrounding the film. It is advised to watch this after viewing the film, because it doesn't discuss production so much as and concept and characters. It tells a lot of the plot before hand. There is a cool slide show gallery of on set images from the film with the movie score.
Be aware there is a Sony Superbit version of the film. This release is supposed to have better picture and sound, but the extras are removed. This edition costs a few more dollars. I haven't seen the Superbit edition, but an online compairson (check dvd-basen) showed slightly sharper picture.

1131298,3,7883631101,"Directory An Lee has done an amazing job to catch Hollywood's eyes on this fusion Chinese Gongfu movie. Maybe this is the first time all the fancy style gongfu is shown on screen ( not the Jackie Chan nor Bruce Li), and this gains enormous public attention. But is the movie really as good as it gets?
Ok, the music is nice, the scene is beautiful, the story is simple with some romance in it, and the ending is something like justice has come, good defeats evil. Yet the movie seems shaky to me. The actions were interpreted in a way that it is not pure gongfu, it is like, hmmmm, let's put it this way:watching Ballet dancer performing Disco. Ah, you can always claim it is artistic, but I consider it funny. As to the acting, I used to like Chow YunFat very much, but definetely not in this one. The romance story does not match any theme of the movie, the young actor talked like he did not eat for several days. The intimate moments of the young actress and actor looked so unnatural, and they are the biggest failure of the movie.

1131299,4,7883631101,"I really like this film now that I've had a chance to watch it a few times. On the first viewing, I just didn't get it. It bored me, and I felt that I was missing something that the Oscar judges hadn't. I mean, like many reviewers have rightly observed, people simply can't fly; wiry women, no matter how tough, can't throw bails of hay ten feet into the air, and if someone stands at the top of a bamboo tree--well, you get the picture. Then I heard Tarantino talking about his homage to the martial arts genre, ""Kill Bill"". He said something like, ""This movie isn't set on planet earth"". I must say that when I heard this, I had a bit of an epiphany. I'd been looking at these films all wrong. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is not supposed to be watched as an action film--it's a fantasy! Accept that, and it's easy to understand why this genre is so popular. The only adventurous twist that Ang Lee brings to the film is the pallet that he uses. This movie positively glows, betraying the massive budget that brought it so easily to a mainstream audience.
We're moving into a new era of cult movies, not surprisingly being led for the most part by people like Tarantino. What we've been crying out for is a codex. If only Kill Bill had been around the first time I watched CTHD, I may well have been an instant fan, but instead, all I had as a precedent was that rather less subtle venture, ""The Matrix"".
You see, I reckon people were stunted rather than informed by what the Wachowskis put on the table back in '99. We were thrilled by what we thought was a new way of making films, but now I for one see that in fact, the film and it's sucessors dumbed down what was originally a beautiful and subtle form of cinema (even taking into account all the flying malarky). The tone, once you've tuned into it, is far more like ""Sense and Sensability"" than ""Drunken Master"", especially when accompanied by an orchestral score (Yoyo Ma displays some beautiful cello playing) that sounds very similar--surely intentionally--to Moriconi's music for ""Once Upon A Time In The West"".
What most of the bad reviews of this film have to offer is, ""Go see The Matrix if you want a REAL action movie"". Again, these guys think they're going to see a different kind of film than what they actually end up paying for. Pity.
Buy this DVD if you want to see a splendidly over-the-top fantasy, beautifully layered and exquisitly choreographed. If you want an action film for which you definately shan't need a codex (or a fully functioning brain), then by all means, buy ""Die-Hard""!",1069977600,2,2566,4.496788008565311

I've watched enough Chinese ""wuxia"" films and TV series throughout my childhood to get tired of them, so when this movie came out I refused to spend money on watching it in the cinemas even though probably everyone I knew in my life had already seen it one way or another. Eventually when I caught this on video, I was thoroughly impressed. The storyline was so good, although it was somewhat similar to what a typical Chinese ""wuxia"" flick would be, I guess it was still kind of different because this is a Hollywood flick with all those better quality special effects and filming thrown in.
With an enigmatic, very intelligent, yet sweet-looking actress like Zhang Zi-Yi acting as a secretly-trained in martial arts, yet rebellious only child of a rich diplomat... falling in love with the leader of a barbarian tribe from Northern China... set against the backdrop of a dusty, sandy desert in China and a somewhat dream-like story, dialogue and screenshots littered throughout the movie to illustrate the budding love between these 2 - this was the main focus and highlight of this movie for me. This love story was so beautiful, quite touching really. Compared to the other love story that's going on in this film, this really stole the day.
Chow Yun-Fat has aged a lot and looks kind of tired, so I can't say that I think he's great in this because he used to be better when he was younger. Michelle Yeoh - another somewhat tired-looking, aged actress who I think has lost most of her youthful looks suits the role she plays - as an older, mature, experienced ""aunt"" that Zhang Zi-Yi can look up to and learn something from. Nevertheless, the 2 older actors Chow and Yeoh played their parts well because they are such experienced actors, so I can't fault them.
Overall, I loved this movie. Lots of quick and skilfully executed fighting scenes, a dreamy love story... I can't imagine watching it in English dubbing though cos it'd be too weird an experience.
If you hate reading subtitles, well you can watch the dubbed version but you'd probably not enjoy this as much.

1131303,5,7883631101,"Over 948 reviews for CTHD (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) means that this review may reiterate what others have probably written.
The scenes in this movie can be appreciated for their beauty by trying to find a large screen projection monitor to view this epic story on. I feel that the Chinese culture can easily be kept from western eyes, but Ang Lee's vision and sensitivity gives us a sense of the passion and pride that is felt towards traditional Chinese customs. I was impressed with the way Lee directed how the players' very glances and expressions showed feelings that words could never explain.
It's quite difficult for me to express how moving CTHD was to watch. I love a good action flick, but I was amazed at how subtle glances draw out a subplot of two people struggling to express their feelings. As the movie progressed, I became more interested in the relationships that the different couples involved had developed. And shockingly, it was a love triangle, with the Green Destiny sword playing the part of the desired object of affection.
The music of composer Tan Dun wound up placing CTHD onto a higher plateau. It's quite a unique and special score for the movie. And Yo Yo Ma's cello performances are stellar. Overall, the sound quality is pristine, and can be enjoyed on most speakers, so don't worry aboout needing reference equipment to enjoy the DVD. Stereo separation with the Dolby Digital 5.1 is quite remarkable. If you do have quality speakers, you'll be blown away.
The video quality is well- transferred from the original print, which is necessary with the number of night scenes that were filmed. The blacks are deep, the highlights are not washed out and the colors and hues are rich and wonderfully saturated.
For those of you who haven't experienced CTHD in a theater, find someone who has the largest television or projection monitor that you can find and watch it there. You can appreciate the details in filming, including the exquisite landscapes and textures, but you miss something if you're watching on a smaller unit. Heck, bring your DVD into a place like Circuit City or the Big Screen Store and ask a worker to pop it in a player to let you see the video in a larger screen.
A parting word of advice: Yes, the stunts showing people running across water, along the sides of buildings and amongst the tree tops is impossible. Keep in mind that this film is based on stories of ancient Chinese folklore and legend, which is larger than life. Taking this movie literally will destroy its intention to simply illustrate such a legend in film.",1063497600,5,2586,4.7616926503340755

But it is a real masterpiece (not a term I use lightly), using action sequences reminiscent of the Matrix with a story line that seamlessly blends intelligence, tragedy, romance, and breathtaking cinematography. It combines to produce a film that won't easily be forgotten.
The DVD package helps make up for some of what must be lost in not seeing the film on the wide screen. The director's comments played over the film show Ang Lee's enthusiasm for this effort, the 20-minute feature on the making of the film shows the unbelievable amount of work that went into creating a film that appears effortless, and the short interview with Michelle Yeoh -- which is probably the weakest of the special features -- is nonetheless informative and entertaining. It's even worth checking out the various trailers to see how the film was packaged in different markets, though I blame all the PR people involved in the marketing of the film for focusing too much on the action and too little on the film's finer elements.",1059782400,4,1190,4.781553398058253

In fact the simple plot, which largely consists of the fight over sword for reasons of heroism, revenge, and pride, gives the movie an interesting 'common, everyday' feel amidst a magical mystical time and place.
In short the movie is about the battle between a prideful confused apprentice searching for something to make her truly happy, a vengeful washed up master aiming to get back at Chow Yun Fet and her own apprentice for becomming better, a noble hero (Michele...), and a would be master torn three ways between his desire to teach young talent (the apprentice), his devotion to truth, righteousness, and heroism, and his secret devotion to a long time love (Michele.)  Other characters enter the scene merely to pull the apprentice in a different direction of ""happiness.""  The prime example is a robber she meets in the desert who becomes her lover after they fight over a stolen comb.

Many people might say they are silly but they are ignorant of Chinese mythology and stylization. As my ethnic Chinese wife says, kung fu masters can just do that (re flying, jumping, etc). It takes that whole canon of film and encapsulates it nicely.
My favorate part was the bittersweet inner-play between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's characters. It is sad when two people truely love each other but never know it...it is sadder when they do but will never realize it. They are both at the twilight of their careers and too much history had past for anything to change but the realization of their feelings.
The direction by Ang Lee was superb, but given his catalog of movies to date that is simply expected. The number of oscars Crouching Tiger garnered is testament to how good his direction was and how good the movie is.
Don't watch this movie with English dubbing. It frankly is not good dubbing and it really takes away from the experience. Also some of the translations are subtly different than the subtitles of the Mandarin dialogue. While I had no problems with the Mandarin spoken, my Mandarin speaking wife chuckled that it was VERY poorly spoken. Fat and Yeoh are not native Mandarin speakers so that is to be expected I suppose.

It was a very moving film, and I think that is why even with the DVD in my collection I still prefer to see it that way.
Everything about this movie is absolutely second to none.  All of the actors performances are outstanding.  The story is romantic, heartbreaking, and adventurous.  The backdrop is breathtaking.  The music is hauntingly beautiful.
Others have written full length reviews providing a detailed map of this movie so I will not bore the reader with that information.  Instead, I will say that this movie had me glued to the screen the first time I saw it and I have seen it several times since purchasing the DVD.  Although many scenes involve superhuman feats and lots of great martial arts work, the movie's strength is in its story and it was a success because of the great work of all the actors and production crew.
I was disappointed that this picture did not win the Best Picture Oscar because I really felt that it was the best movie I saw that year and one of the best I've ever seen.  I think perhaps it failed to win only due to being a foreign language film.  Now you can enjoy the picture without that minor hinderance, should you choose to.

1131459,3,7883631101,"If you could, for one moment, forget that this film was Chinese and there was no language barriers involved. Switch the Chinese actors to Americans and made the sword fights into gun fights, then this is not a special film by any means. I think Americans are so excited about this film because they rarely get to see this genre in the states that is very common in many Asian countries.
This story is built around relationships. Mubai with Jen, Jen with Xiao Lone, Mubai with Michelle Yoeh's character. One thing that this film manages to do fairly well is the intertwine these stories seamlessly. I loved the score by Tan Dun and the song featuring Coco Lee. This film also has several major fight scenes. Although these are well choreographed, they seem a bit implausible (too much flying. and that toe on water was ridiculous). I felt the characters' madarin were a little off(no offense, because they had to learn it in a month or something).
I don't believe this film deserved an Oscar nomination. Soon, more Asian kung fu films will be flying into the U.S. and the population will be jaded and tired of these as they have tired with the Western.",1049068800,4,1151,4.619512195121951
1131460,5,7883631101,"This was definitely the best movie of 2000.  How Gladiator got past this is way beyond me.
One thing I'd like contribute is some thoughts about the overall themes in the movie.  In the end, I think, Ang Lee sets up several different zones of tension: Between youth and age, between men and women, between discipline and desire and between love and duty. In order to get to some sort of satisfying interpretation of the meaning of the end of the movie, we really have to understand all four tensions and the nexus that this creates in the plot.
When Jen asks Li Mubai ""Is it the sword you want, or me?"" this is one of the critical points in the movie. On the one hand Li Mubai and Yu Shulian are inextricably linked.  On the other, Li is being offered a chance to revitalize his earthly life through youth either sexually as the lover of a younger woman, or as a teacher if Jen would agree to become the ""ultra-disciple"" that every true teacher longs for.  Ang Lee saves Li Mubai from making this decision by having Jen faint.  As in other incidents in the film, this incident highlights Li's major character flaw, indecision or weakness of will.
Something that a number of people have noted is that the climactic fight scenes in the movie are really between Yu Shulian and Jen. An explanation of this conflict might come from the ways in which Jen refuses to accept either Yu Shulian's path of discipline (thus subjecting herself to authority) or a life of total anarchy on the run with Jade Fox. As a younger woman she is trying to establish an independent way for herself on her own terms.  This is perhaps one of the things about her character that endears her to western and younger audiences in particular.
The tension between men and women is something that has been remarked upon by many observer. One example of this is the background story to Jade Fox and her rebellion against Wudang (as a woman she could be the lover of Li Mubai's teacher but could never be a student).  Ang Lee does not resolve this conflict either.  He certainly raises the issue of androcentrism in the Jiang Hu world and one notes with dismay that the characters which challenge the patriarchal system (Jade Fox) are cut down or self-sacrifice (Jen and perhaps even Yu Shulian).  Nevertheless, the sympathies of the film in both narrative and affect lie firmly with the women:  While the women are generously drawn and rendered as fully three-dimensional characters, the men (even Li Mubai) seem more hesitant or unidimensional.  Wudang is not a sheltering company of brothers but a flat and rather chilly place.
The last two conflicts (between duty and love and discipline and desire) might at first seem to be the same.  However, they differ in one important way:  Duty and love are relationships between peoplewhereas discipline and desire are interior states that apply to individuals.
In the relationship between Li Mubai and Yu Shulian, duty is manifested in social obligations to one's sworn brothers and sisters (relationships upon which one's membership in society rests), whereas their love for one another conflicts with their obligations to others (in particular the dead) and their own reluctance or fear to speak openly of how they feel.
By contrast, discipline and desire are much more individual. Discipline requires the voluntary submission of the individual (as in the case of Yu Shulian's self-imposed fidelity to her dead fiance or as represented by Li Mubai's repeated offer to Jen to become his student). On the opposite side of this relationship, desire is the gratification of individual needs. Ang Lee suggests, in true Buddhist, Confucian and Shakespearean form that the consequences of uncontrolled desire are ultimately disastrous. Jade Fox's desire for martial arts abilities and for revenge motivates her ultimate descent into evil.  Desire for autonomy and her own caprice leads Jen to steal the sword Green Destiny and finally causes the death of Li Mubai and Yu Shulian's loss of the love of her life.
Within this context, I would suggest that Jen's final decision is an attempt by Ang Lee to respond to these contradictions within the movie.  She is finally free but free to do what?  She cannot go back to her old life.  Her mentor is dead, and she can no longer be a daughter in her father's house.  But just as clearly, she cannot become a traditional wife, nor, without Li Mubai, can she enter Wudang, even if she wanted to. In a sense she began the movie reacting to others (resisting her marriage, resisting the roles laid out for respectable young women, resisting the restraints of the Wudang path).  In the end she is freed of those restraints but it is clear that she must now carry the burden of the consequences of her actions.
In the end, one is left with a number of  questions. Did Ang Lee intend to say that women who challenge the authority of men must inevitably lose something they hold dear?  That youth without guidance causes destruction? That experience can become crippled by regret or propriety?  That the price of freedom is terrifying isolation?  Maybe there was a little of all of those in this  movie.  I totally see why a lot of mainstream US responses were ""I really liked this movie until the last 2 minutes""  This is because the last two minutes can really only be understood in the context of Chinese notions of duty, obligation and freedom as nothingness.
I suspect that Jen's surrender to nothingness as she falls marks a transformation for her.  She has become enlightened (in a Buddhist fashion perhaps?).  My sympathies however are with Yu Shulian who has to pick up the pieces after everyone else has died and moved on. If Jen represents transcendence then Yu Shulian represents the ability to make your own way forward in a hard world with generosity and courage, one step at a time.",1048896000,9,5841,4.756435643564356

1131583,4,7883631101,"It is should be no surprise that I only just decided to view this film.  As a Johnny come lately to the world of DVD, and a rare theatergoer, my excuse is that I am simply slow on the uptake.  In addition, I am a bit of a rebel which means that I usually thing that 10 million viewers cant possible be right.  It is also difficult to have something interesting to say when you are the thousandth reviewer.
Like just about everyone else, I agree that this is an exceptional film, especially in its genre as a Hong Kong fight film, but also as a piece of filmic art.  Certainly, the cinematography is immaculate.  I felt transported to a magical China.  Whether the scenes are panoramic vistas, visions of life in Chinese towns, or close settings in homes or caves, Ang Lee has spared no effort as being breathtaking and realistic.  While the story is not unique, it is well presented, and the actors quite believable.  It has several layers, the most important being the difficult role of strong women in Chinese culture.  Perhaps the least important being the retrieval of the sword Green Destiny, stolen by young Jen who desperately does not want to become a noble Chinese homemaker, although that is the source of the plot.
What makes the film special in its genre is the focus on emotions and personal feelings, rather than fight scenes and bravado.  I'm going to be honest though, this is still a Hong Kong fight film, one where the players pause from the spectacular fight sequences to do some pretty professional emoting.  Good stuff, but don't fall for the hype that makes the film sound like the next Doctor Zhivago.  It is a very strong fight film with surprising depths, but it is not a dramatic masterpiece
The thing I liked least was the wirework.  It simply goes too far.  The actors dance across the rooftops like Peter Pan and Wendy, with nary a thump, bonk or rustle.  They never quite touch down and it is rare that someone actually is hit.  Even in anime, where characters float about all the time, a hit is a hit and things bend when you land on them.  It is very hard to take a fight seen seriously when the actors float about like leaves.  One the other hand, the choreography is amazing, and it is surprising that no one ever accidentally does major damage to themselves or someone else.
I'm only giving the film a four simply because I disagree with critics like Joe Siegel who declared this 'One of the greatest movies ever made.'  This is hype, and distorts the real values of the film.  It demonstrated that a genre that is rarely treated seriously is capable of being much more than it has been until now.

1131588,5,7883631101,"Director Ang Lee created, perhaps, the most cinematically beautiful, and dramatic martial arts film ever made with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The film weaves a complex web of love, honor, vengeance and justice in feudal China several hundred years ago in which highly skilled, monastically-trained martial arts warriors battle for justice against thieves, robbers, highwaymen and other outlaws.  One of these warriors, the famous Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow, known also for his role as the King of Siam in ""Anna and the King""), is the keeper and user of the prized four-century-old sword known as the Green Destiny.  Having found no one worthy enough to be his disciple, Li Mu Bai decides to retire and give the Green Destiny to an old friend, Sir Te (Sihung Lung), via his very dear female friend and trained warrior, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, also known for her role of Wai Lin in the 1997 James Bond film ""Tomorrow Never Dies"").
Invited to stay as Sir Te's guest, Yu Shu Lien meets one of Sir Te's other guests: a nobleman's young daughter, Yu Jen (Ziyi Zhang), who is very interested in the lives of warriors; but is betrothed to a nobleman.  Initially unknown to Yu Shu Lien, Jen's nanny is an old foe of Li Mu Bai: Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng), who killed Li Mu Bai's master many years earlier.  Jen is a troubled young woman.  During a crossing of China's western desert, the caravan that Jen is traveling in is attacked by highwaymen.  They don't attack the women, but one of them, Lo 'Dark Cloud' (Chen Chang) steals a comb from Jen.  She chases after him, fights with him and becomes separated from the caravan.  Lo admires her fighting skills (since she has received training from Jade Fox) and is attracted to her.  A romance develops between them, but they each eventually realize that Jen must return to her family.
Upon discovering that the Green Destiny is in Sir Te's house, a disguised Jen steals it and begins an odyssey of trying to live a warrior's life; but her naive view of an ideal warrior's life changes as reality catches up to her.
The highly choreographed martial arts scenes in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are compelling and emotional.  Rather than being the focus of the film, they enhance the underlying story. The aggrandized abilities of the warriors to oppose gravity increase the drama and excitement, and add a mythological element to the film.  In some ways, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is reminiscent of the 1977 classic ""Star Wars"", but without any electronic technology.
It is not surprising that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" won four Oscars in 2001 for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Foreign Language Film and Best Music (Original Score).  The hauntingly beautiful cello played by Yo-Yo Ma in the theme music increases the emotional depth of the film.  The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Song, and Best Costume Design.  Ang Lee was nominated for Best Director.
I enjoy watching this film both in its original Mandarin with English subtitles and when dubbed in English.  The English dubbing was done very well and does not detract much from the original emotion portrayed by the actors who spoke in Mandarin throughout.

That makes me a minority since CTHD was critically acclaimed but NOT popular with the Chinese. So I know and understand those who thought CTHD was [a terrible] or so-so movie.
I've been disappointed with movies before, so my advice is to take note of the REVIEWS instead of just the hype. And browsing through the positive reviews of CTHD here, it looks as though the people who really enjoyed the movie were usually those who went to the cinema, saw it on the big screen, heard the Mandarin soundtrack, read the subtitles, appreciated restrained love stories and didn't have a clue as to what to expect in a Chinese martial arts movie.
It also seems that the reviewers who hated or didn't cared for CTHD generally wanted more action (or a faster and more convoluted story), couldn't accept the martial skill of ""weightlessness"" (or didn't like the wire-work), got bored with the plodding middle-age romance (or the frivolous teenage romance ), or any one or more of the above. My guess is also that they also didn't read the sub-titles.
I'll also admit that I'm a Michelle Yeoh fan and not a Zhang Ziyi fan, so Zhang's 20 minute flashback sequence was tedious for me and the teahouse scene was just comic relief. But at least I'm clear about my own expectations. I was also aware that Ang Lee had certain commercial ""requirements"" to meet in CTHD (120 min length, youthful romance, blah X 3).
So after much thought, I realised that enjoying any movie depends on what you wanted to see in it in the first place. Since Tsui Hark's ground-breaking 1990 sword-fighting epic, ""Swordsman"" -- where ONE martial artist acquired astounding ""telekinetic"" and ""levitational"" skills -- the Hong Kong movie industry filled the next decade with movies where ALL the martial artist displayed ""telekinetic"" and ""levitational"" skills. Most of my friends accepted it as THE way a martial arts movie should be done, but I got very sick by 2000.
So I obviously had the ""right"" mind-set for watching CTHD and I loved the way the martial artists in CTHD ""leaped"" instead ""hovered"", and actually ""fought"" each other with fists and weapons instead of ""blasting"" each other with their qi(energy) or will. I'm glad that Yuen was challenged by Ang Lee to choreograph the close-quarter combat sequences with their precise manoeuvres and counter-manoeuvres.
I also have some appreciation for Chinese music, landscape paintings and architecture, so the Tan Dun's score, Peter Pau's cinematography and Tim Yip's sets and decor were enthralling for me. I have had a western education so it may be that I am looking at such ""exotic"" eastern culture with a westerner's eye.
But over and above the production values, Ang Lee and his stellar cast infused CTHD with light humor, suppressed emotions as well with several underlying themes. One of those themes was that everyone could be a ""crouching tiger or a hidden dragon"", i.e. everyone has the potential to become a great menance or a great person. Think about it, what made Zhang's character end up destroying almost everyone around but her own innate selfishness and impetuousness?",1024358400,12,3608,4.858766233766234

From the landscdapes to the action sequences, the film is beautiful.  Chow Yun-Fat's performance as Li Mu Bai is fantastic.  Michelle Yeoh is his equal, and Ziyi Zhang's star making performance was worth the praise it received.  And as usual, Ang Lee's direction was spot on. I loved the presence that he brought to the screen as the mythical warrior.  He is so in control of every scene that he is in (particually the action scenes).  I recommend this film to any fan of the genre or as an introduction to Asian fimmaking(or Iron Monkey).  As with other Hong Kong films, it may seem a bit schizophrenic, as it goes from action to drama to Greek tragedy, however thats how films are there as the economics of the average film goer in Hong Kong means that they want every thing in a film.  Deserving of all accolades, this is a must see for martial arts fans, cine-philes, and anyone looking to see anything outside of the realm of a predictable Hollywood action film.",1022716800,3,1105,4.517587939698492

Unfortunately, apart from its big name director and Asian A-List actors, this movie was just mediocre in its genre. However, the special effects are still quite enjoyable on the big screen, but once transfered to DVD, unless you own a screen large enough to see all the flying and martial arts scenes as it was meant to be seen, the whole aspect of the movie is lost.

But in overall terms I have to agree with those who say it was overrated - I am really not sure why this film won several Academy awards.
To me, if you're going to dispense with reality (all that inexplicable flying left me wondering if Chow Yun Fat was floating amongst cannibis rather than bamboo), you might as well go all the way and produce something as visually spectacular (though nonsensical) as A Man Called Hero.  But this film fully achieves neither the fantastical nor the believable; as mystical fantasies go it is half-pie, while preventing the saving grace of suspension of disbelief.  The Matrix at least gave a semi-plausible reason for its characters' ability to fly.
If you are into Wu Xia films this may be for you, but the fact this film was not particularly popular in asian countries confirms for me that it was not anything particularly special.",1020902400,6,1024,4.779661016949152

1131987,5,7883631101,"With this film, Ang Lee and his team have created a masterpiece that deserved every accolade and award it received, and more. It's ideal entertainment that doesn't get old after repeated viewings, and it is the convergence of many genuine talents and career-best accomplishments in one package.
The DVD is also an excellent addition to any film fan's collection. The widescreen image transfer is outstanding, with bright, sharp detail and vivid color, and the 5.1 surround sound is excellent. It's also generously stocked with extra features, including a very nice extended ""interview"" with Michelle Yeoh.
I liked the commentary track by Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus, although they get a bit too cheeky and aimless at times (especially Schamus). I also felt there should have been more discussion of several key scenes, but that's a common weakness of commentary tracks.
The film's credits include Coco Lee's Oscar-nominated song, ""A Love Before Time,"" which can be heard in either Mandarin or English -- a nice touch.
However, the DVD's weakest link is the English dubbing, although on the whole it's well done. At least some of the bad reviews here are from those reacting to the dubbed version. Anyone who chooses to view only the dubbed version is making a mistake.
Why? First, the characters are best heard with their natural voices, which lends credence to each scene. I want to hear Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, not fill-ins (Chang Chen's English-dubbed voice makes him sound like a used car salesman). Second, some of the dubbed scenes lack the nuances of the original screenplay. For example, the ""legend of the young man"" lacks continuity in the dubbed version, so that when the legend is referenced again late in the film, this key scene has none of the impact the subtitled version has.
In another scene, when Jen tells Lo to leave her, her mother announces she heard a noise. Jen says in dubbed English, ""It's just a bat."" But the original line in Mandarin refers to a ""cat"" (i.e. Tiger), so the careful irony is lost in the dubbing.
But the inevitable faults of dubbing should not harm anyone's enjoyment of this monumental film. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is truly gorgeous and breathtaking -- it's one of those rare moments where every cinematic element comes together just right.

As an individual with Asian descent, I remember hearing my mother talk about stories and tales about martial artists that could climb walls and even fight in a pseudo-flight. Well, this film portrays that fairy tale well and the subtle differences, such as Mandarin versus Cantonese languages, enhance the movies credibility. Most of us Americans might not understand nor appreciate this, but it is important and not to be discounted.
The movie is done in sub-titles so it adds to the authenticity. Many of my friends scoffed that the martial arts were faught in the trees and on walls and that the characters could fly. I had to re-explain to them that this is a legend, a tale, a story just as we all have our tales of various heros that are surreal such as Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, etc. If you understand that China has an extremely long history filled with their own mythology, you'll appreciate what this movie strives to achieve. If you want realism in todays world, forget it, you'll not like the movie.
I believe that this movie is the best of its kind. If you look at what I've rated, you'll see I do not give many 5 stars out. I reserve those for what I feel are the very best in class.

Specifically, the extended flashback plastered over the middle of the story just brings the whole thing to a halt.  Parts of it are amusing, and the backstory of Jen and Lo is important to the tale, but it just feels like it's not the same movie to me, especially given Lo's relative unimportance in the bigger story.
The ending's a bit anti-climactic, and the most crucial fight scene is too distant from the ending to carry it through on momentum, but the performances are wonderful (avoid the dubbed version--subtitles help preserve the nuance), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the action is unparalleled.

I say this because it is a movie that opens under the radar screen of the business types in Tinseltown. Such a film creates a 'buzz' among audiences who then discuss and debate it. This leads to more people's wanting to see it, if for no reason other than to find out what all the talk is about. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one such movie. Who would have dreamed that a Chinese martial arts film, in which the characters speak Mandarin, could take in over a hundred million dollars and be nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture?
The story is perhaps more about love than it is about fighting. It takes place long ago in a time where myths. legends and magical things were created. Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien [Yun-Fat chow and Michelle Yeoh] are two warriors whose love for each either has remained unspoken. When Li Mu's ancient sword is stolen by a powerful enemy, the witch-like Jade Fox, he tells Shu Lien that it doesn't matter too much because he is no longer going to fight. Shu Lien goes to visit a powerful friend and discovers that a governor's beautiful and mysterious daughter, Jen [Ziyi Zhang], may have had a hand in the theft. Jen's father has arranged a marriage for her, but her heart secretly yearns for Lo [Chen Chang], a desert bandit who once kidnapped her and fell in love with her. The lives of these four characters intersect in some strange and quite unexpected ways.
The power of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon lies in director Ang Lee's lyrical approach. The characters practice a form of martial arts in which they literally fly into the air. They run effortlessly up walls and even fight among the treetops. As choreographed by Yuen Puo-Ping, who also worked on The Matrix, the fight scenes are more flights of fancy and breathtaking dances than they are blood and guts. Filmed on location in rural China, the movie contains some spectacular scenery and glorious architecture.
While I am praising the film, I must also admit that it did not blow me away like it did many audiences and critics. No movie, no matter how near perfection it is, has universal appeal. I think my problem here is that I am rarely inspired by dialog such as 'a faithful heart makes wishes come true.' Or, 'sharpness is a state of mind.' Such phrases sound good and are often true, but they are oversimplifications of complex issues and are often used to hold power over the gullible and the naive. The movie is filled with such talk, which I found tiresome after a while. Ironically, I am more impressed with Lee's English-langauge movies, especially Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm. I cannot be deny that Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a beautiful and entertaining movie.

What is the reason of this? The reason is this film was not a fresh film for Asia people. They have already seen many films like this style. It was just a well-made one. However, it attracted public attention and people acknowledged it as a splendid film especially in the Western countries. Furthermore, it won a prize for foreign language film at the Academy Awards. Director Ang Lee who came from Taiwan made it, but Columbia Pictures presented it, which is America Company. Therefore, an American film is why it can receive a prize at the Oscar.
The title of this film means the name of characters; there are four main characters in this film. Among these, two young man and womans name are tiger and dragon. These names are very common in Asia countries, especially in China and Korea. Two men and two women, they classify into young and old. It has many meanings. First of all, the best warrior, Li Mu Bai and a woman who loves him. They love each other, but they do not appear above the surface their love. On the contrary, young man and woman, Dragon and Tiger, they do love passionately. Therefore, they do not care about anything for their love. Li Mu Bai, he does not like to be proud of his military arts and actually, he wants to retire in the public. The sword is no meaning for him any more. However, Tiger, she likes to be boast of her skills and want to be the best warrior. Therefore, she wants to beat Li Mu Bai. She does not care about anything just for the best.
Four main characters describe this film as they contrast each other. Frankly speaking, I have seen this pattern from the films, which made by director, Kar-wai Wong. For example, Ashes of Time (1994), Chungking Express (1995) and Fallen Angels (1997), like these films, they have a same pattern. Four main characters, two men and two women, they are all related to each other. I do not know exactly what Ang Lee thinks about it and why he creates four people. Nevertheless, it looks like similar style compare with Kar-wai Wongs works.
In addition, gorgeous martial art scenes, especially the scene which
Li Mu Bai chases Tiger in the bamboo forest, and standing on the bamboo tree. This is the best part of this film. In fact, it had been shown at the films of director, King Hu who was the most famous director like these kinds of film. In his film, A Touch of Zen (1969), there is a bamboo scene like this film. Anyway, this film was good for description each character and beautiful scenes of landscape in China. The most impression scene was a last scene; Tiger jump into the cloud on the cliff.

This not only causes the unrequited love between Master Bai and Yu Shu Lien to be further postponed by duty, but also signals the development of Jen Yu and her romantic discovery. As the identify of the thief is gradually revealed a showdown looms with both Bai and Lien representing the good and the thief representing evil.
A wonderful film in that it managed to make a whole generation of multiplex-only movie watchers that not all good things only come out of America. However there is much to enjoy in this film that still will have been lost on such an audience. The film mixes a raft of subplots around the main focus of the theft of the sword. However we also have the development, romance and envious greed of Jen Yu, the conflict between Yu and Yu Shu Lien and of course the love between Master Li Mu Bai and Lien that has been put off due to duty.
The stories all work well - the mystery surrounding the stolen sword and the search for Jade Fox make for a compelling mystery while the romance between Master Bai and Lien is beautifully observed throughout. The story surrounding Jen Yu is very good as it follows her development throughout however her desert romance is perhaps a little too slow for a martial arts movie. The only complaint about the stories is that they are a little heavy for a martial arts film - or maybe there is too much fighting for a well plotted movie? Actually it's probably a brave mix that has some of the best of both worlds.
The martial arts action is sensational - Yuen Wo Ping excels himself with one stunning visual treat after another. The wire work is great even by Hong Kong standards - imagine the impact this had on an audience who thought that wire-work had been invented by the Matrix! The standout scenes are the battle between Lien and Jen Yu and the Jen Yu's battle in a crowded barroom. The only complaint I did have is that the treetop fight near the end was not as exciting as other scenes and was also the least realistic and came across as silly at times. In terms of visuals, the film is beautifully shot and picks up the gorgeous Chinese landscape well - the only problem being that this seems to distract from the main story.
Michelle Yeoh is as impressive and as beautiful as she is in everything else I've seen her in - you can keep your Julia Roberts rom-coms, I want more of Yeoh's acting talents rather than pure star power. Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as Master Bai and he works well in his scenes with Yeoh. He even manages the martial arts really well despite not having made one before but I would have liked to see first choice Jet Li in the role. The standout is Zhang Ziyi in only her second film. She shines in the most difficult character and manages to convey so much and still be excellent in complex fight scenes. And how does Hollywood reward her? By sticking her in Rush Hour 2! That's like taking a beautiful flower and trying to plant it in the middle of a concrete slab!
Overall it's a little slow for the martial arts crowd but it is a wonderful mix of Lee's art house films and the martial arts genre. At times the mysticism gets a bit too heavy to be truly meaningful but it's an exquisitely beautiful piece of filmmaking.",1015027200,11,3324,4.380258899676376

These are characters that have flaws and desires to be sure, but making them human and with depth. In other words, you will care what will happen next.

this is a beautiful movie...maybe not as dazzling as ""the matrix"" a movie people always bring up in comparison but its like comparing ozzy to beethoven...both are playing music and doing it well..but in completely different styles",1014854400,2,679,4.619834710743802
1132207,5,7883631101,"I'll start off by saying that yes, I was looking for more of a Matrix film when I entered the theather.  Upon leaving, however, I was amazed.  I think Tan Dun (music composer of the film) said it best; ""We should look at Martial Arts as the traditional art in China - not the fatal, bloody, violent impression that Hong Kong films have given a Western audience.  We would look at it philosophically, culturally, and with a human touch.""
If, prior to viewing the film, you want to see Matrix style action..your in the wrong boat.  The Martial Arts in the movie are very impressive and, dare I say, better than Martix.  Sure, they lack the intensity that Matrix had but don't let that fool you; the real magic is elsewhere...in their style.
The plot is a tried and true method in the movie realm.  Sure, it's many stories in one but the way they tell it is impressive.  The love story is pretty darn good and even the conflict between these characters are amazing.  And on a side note, I would suggest watching the movie in Mandarin with Subtitles because the voices are so much more fitting.
The theme of people flying around as if gravity barely exsisted may make some turn away,but what is the point of watching a ""fantasy"" film if your expecting real world physics to be applied to it?
All in all, exceedingly great movie.  Yes, I would suggest a rent first because you should never buy something on a whim.  But the reviews I've read, it seems that some are on different ends of the poll so I'm almost forced to say that.  But I wouldn't pass this film as anything less than amazing.  This is what good movies look like.",1014422400,4,1623,4.427609427609427
1132208,3,7883631101,"This film is Ang Lee's homage to martial arts films, and he does a good job.  We follow two aging experts - one male, one female - as they try to find a quiet life for themselves together.  Unfortunately, their old nemesis reappears with an apprentice.  The apprentice has stolen the master's legendary sword and has taught herself (from a stolen manual) the secrets of the Wudan, the martial arts society that is the pinnacle of skill, instructing its students in the art of swordplay, unarmed combat, and ""flying.""
The film is visually spectacular.  The scenery of the desert, the bamboo forest, and a recreated 18 century Beijing are all beautifully filmed and provide an epic backdrop.  The fight scenes are also beautiful to behold, well-choreographed, exciting, and oddly realistic, considering the belligerents can defy gravity at will.  The soundtrack, with its staccato drums to emphasize the action and haunting cello meoldies (by Yo Yo Ma), is a perfect accompaniment for the images.
Unfortunately, the story itself does not hold up the sections between the fight sequences.  Usually this is not a problem with martial arts movies, as the plot is secondary.  However, in this film more time is spent in exposition than fighting, so we must assume the plot was meant to be important.  There are two glaring problems (for me) that detract from the enjoyment of the film.  The first is the nature of the ""main"" character, the apprentice evil-doer.  The screenplay seems to keep changing its mind - is she the rogue with a heart of gold or a selfish brat that deserves what she gets?  We are left wondering why the old master keeps forgiving her faults, and how she could have made the brigand chief fall in love with her.  Secondly, there is the problem of a 20-minute flashback sequence explaining the love between the apprentice and the brigand chief.  It comes out of nowhere half-way into the film and disrupts the whole flow.  Surely the script should have been reworked to ease into this subplot; as it is, it seems forced on us and we resent it.
It's entirely possible that a native Mandarin speaker would not agree with my criticisms.  I know when I watch English movies subtitled in French (or vice versa), the subtlties and nuances do not always translate well, and I'm sure it would be worse crossing a cultural barrier from Euro-American to Chinese.  However, Lee's own ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" was wonderful and had the same potential issue, so I have to think the subtitles are not totally to blame and the fault lies in the script.
The commentary on this DVD is quite fun to listen to.  There are tidbits of information that explain why and how the film was made and explaining scenes.  There are also some funny moments, where Schamus is pointing out ""cheesey shots.""  There's also a making-of featurette that is interesting, showing how the stunts were performed with wires.  However, the commentary is the jewel of the DVD edition, aside from the superior sound and video quality that is inherent to the format.
Overall, I enjoyed the film, and can see why it was so successful.  However, I was disappointed by the inconsistencies with the apprentice character and the plotting in general, which lowered the film's rating.",1014249600,3,3245,4.83001808318264

""Ziyi is freakin' hot (which doesn't make a difference to me, on a side note)!"" ""Amazing actors!"" ""Best movie ever!""
I came to expect a lot from this movie. I was, quite literally, bouncing as the DVD started.
Was I let down. The plot, though it tries valiantly to come off as deep and intelligently brooding, was far from amazing. The main plot itself is shallow enough: Lost magic sword. Find magic sword. That's the gist of it. There are, of course, millions of subplots, all of which have been done time and time again. The characters are nothing more than your cliched characters-pseudovillains-protagonists. The love story(ies) have been done more than once, you might even be able to find it in cheesy romance novels.
All in all, I would have given this movie 1 star, if not for its fight scenes, which were also highly overrated. They were nice, but they weren't as good as people made them out to be.
I suggest The Matrix before this one.",1013990400,10,1252,4.495614035087719
1132210,5,7883631101,"This movie was easily the best of the 2001, with superb special effects, good (if not Oscar-worthy) acting, solid directing and scenery that is varied and gorgeous.
The story concerns a master warrior, Li Mu Bai, who wishes to retire from fighting, but must embark on a final quest when his legendary sword, The Green Destiny, is stolen. His quest is undertaken with the aid of the love of his life, Yu Shu Lien who is an accomplished warrior as well, who was married to his brother, and so the two cannot consummate their love. The movie has two parallel love stories, the second concerning Jen, a noblewoman, and a young bandit; both stories end tragically.
The plot and romance seem blase, and though they are somewhat ordinary, they are told with suprising skill, drawing the audience in. But the power of this movie lies in the superb action scenes, which are not simply fun for the average action fan, but for people who enjoy well-choreographed, balletic, almost-poetic duels, even one with some humor injected in. All of the major stars are very graceful and the digital removal of wires and harnesses, leaves the audience with seamless scenes.
Some reviewers claim the fight scenes in ""The Matrix"" were superior, but I would call to your attention the dojo scene with Neo and Morpheus. Their range of motion does not match those found here, and one can tell the stars are not trained in martial arts. For me, at least, it detracts from the movie--with the mindset that they should have the fullest range of motion, it is disappointing to watch them painfully stretch to exectute low kicks (I can personally kick higher and have had no training in the martial arts).

At the centre of this triangle is ""Jen"" (Zhang Ziyi) who has the potential, under the right guidance (Mu Bai's of course), to reach the very highest level of martial arts mastery.  Jen, unfortunately, already has a teacher....
Ang Lee's return to his Far Eastern origins strikes all the familiar notes of ""Wuxia"":  scenic battles on rooftops, in dodgy taverns, on water and among bamboo groves.  As usual -- at least according to current permutations of the genre in Hong Kong -- it features women of remarkable skill in roles both beneficial and malevolent to the male protagonist.  The film is an astute exploitation of the emerging prominence in Hollywood of Chow and Yeoh.  Yeoh, for example, is the only real martial artist in the film and so -- rather wisely -- she is given the most demanding fight sequences:  the use she makes of the entire range of Chinese weaponry is not something one could master on set in a few months.  As for Chow, who never acts in Wuxia films, all he has to perform -- again wisely -- is a few striking poses with lots of cinematic cuts in between.
While the action sequences are good, I've definitely seen better from the genre.  The die-hard Wuxia fan will also complain at the film's evident kowtowing to North American film conventions:  the kind of romanticised love between Jen and her ""barbarian"" boyfriend being a case in point.  Considering the director's earlier Far Eastern excursions, he could have perhaps pushed the dark side of the film a tad further towards the cutting edge by suggesting a lesbian relationship between Jen and Jade Fox... but all in all it remains a competent and entertaining effort.",1013904000,2,1855,4.765625
1132320,4,7883631101,"The Sticky had high expectations for this movie as he hope that the true story of the Sticky Rice would be told.  Though historians have for centuries tried to bury it, the Sticky Rice has for eons played a big part in the development of Kung Fu.  For example, the Shaolin Monks used the preparation of sticky rice as part of their training.  Each monk would individually kick every grain of rice to each other so as to get that soft, gooey texture, go around kicking and punching the ingredients which made the stuffing and even shave their hair off so they could wrap the leaves around their heads to get the right shape when it came to wrapping it all together.
So it was a massive disappointment when the Sticky saw the final result.  Sure, the action sequences were cool, them flying around kicking and punching everyone but there was no mention of the Sticky Rice!
The only consolidation was that Ang Lee made homage's to classic Sticky Rice movies.  When Chow did his funky healing techniques it was reminded me of the Sticky Rice kid, when Mr Miyagi healed Daniel-san in similar fashion.

Chow Yun-Fat has always been one of my favorite actors.  He helped set a start to the Hong Kong Blood Opera genre that John Woo has perfected (see Hard Boiled, now) and is perfect for this movie.
Michelle Yeoh is breathtaking in this film.  Some may argue that she looks old, but I think her beauty is natural and timeless.  I saw her in Tomorrow Never Dies, but never expected her to pull in a performance like this.
Zhang Ziyi is going to bear my children someday.  I always say this to my friends everytime I watch the movie, and I say it again when I see Rush Hour 2.  Not only is she stunning, but she can pull off even the most complicated of fight scenes.

The action sequences aren't as gratuitous as I had worried prior to watching, they flow nice and you instantly accept the fairy tale flight of these warriors. The plot is very intricate, but easy to follow, as the tale itself is sorta timeless. There are wonderful female characters in this film too and Michelle Yeowh (sp?) does marvelous acting (remember, this is all judged from subtitles and the power of her body language and eyes!).
The introduction of characters is nice and the pace of the story flows very nice with the exception of a 20+ minute flashback, however it all ties together in the end wonderfully. You won't find many twists or surprises per se, but the storyline is enough to keep you interested and ponder upon.
This is not a fancy kung-fu film. It focuses a lot on emotion and character desire and uses the ninja action to progress the plot.
The DVD itself is quite nice and has lots of basic features. The ""Making of"" documentary was a bit dissapointing if you are looking for how the special effects are done. Apparently, there is also an English over-dub track for those who don't want to read the subtitles. (I discovered this later, but have no regrets for watching the original manderin version). There are also a few basic interviews and filmographies.
Special features is not a reason to buy this DVD, the beauty of the widescreen cinematography and score is. When the film ended, I just sat there for a few minutes with a nice film to soak in.",1010707200,3,1677,4.6120401337792645

If only that bratty ""Herroine""  had jumped from the ledge at the begining we may have been sparred all that undo hype.
Now if you want a good movie of this genre, you should buy Charlie's Angels.  Charlies Angels was a superior film in every measurable way.  Three Heroic Heroines that we could get behind. A clasicand sweep tale that is now part of our american culture. Compared to Charlies Angels you will inevitably see that Crouching Tiger is inferior in many respects.  The first is sound track.  Tupac Shukr, was a pivital figure in American music culture.  on this sound track you have a song that captures his talent at its peak, That song is the Humpty Dance.  This was a song that challenged the Rythem and the Style taht we were used too.  Also superior in Charlie's Angels is the MAle lead.  Compared to watching Chow Yung Fat mope about for the whole movie, we have a true hero in Bill Murray's Bozley.

The fight scenes are equally convincing except that when these Characters fly they explain it with heliocopters and Airplanes and such not just being from China.  and if you really need to have subtitles you may select this as an option the DVD.  In conclusion,  compared to Charlie's Angels Crouching Tiger looks like the work of a film student well on his way to a promising career a mickey dee's.  Actually compared to Crouching Tiger most tape worms look good, but I digress.  anyway I hope that you have found my review helpful.

Despite all that it is a film that you can't help but love. One of the main assets is the incredible attractiveness of the main players. The basic plot revolves around a young woman who is an accomplished warrior. She is one of the more stunning actors unearthed in some time. The two older principles are also stars with immense screen prescence.
One of the great strengths of the film apart from this is the beauty of the photograpy and the scence creation. Each scene is absolutely visually stunning and wonderfully set up. When one speaks to people who have seen the film they will talk about the battle on the tree tops or the scene at the end in the gorge. It is difficult to think of any recent film which has been so visually stylish.

It actually gives it a nice touch, specially in the fight in the forest. What really surprised me the most was Zhang Ziyi who played Jen, she was great, not to mention beautiful, she was a perfect character, believable and alluring, plus mysterious, funny, everything you could want from a character. This plus everything else makes this movie a great experience, I don't mind that it is in Mandarin, actually I liked that, makes it unique. The DVD is fairly good, some featurretes, trailers, music videos, comments, the least you expect from a regular edition. The sound and picture are good. Plus, this beautiful love story, which is weird since most of the times I can't find good love stories, is strong, real and beautiful, with a strong and sad but fulfilling ending, at least to me.

There was so much visual beauty throughout the picture, I was sometimes annoyed that the screen was cluttered with subtitles and I spent more time reading than being immersed in the story.
The dub was actually the best I have ever heard (I mostly watch asian films in their native languages, anyway), and at no point was I bothered by the lack of synchronicity between mouths and voices.  In fact, I watched many parts repeatedly, confused by the way the voice over seemed to match their facial articulations so perfectly.  While I still enjoy the movie in Mandarin, the English version allows me a greater level of immersion and wiling suspension of disbelief.

While the English dubbed track isn't the worst I've heard, you really don't want to watch the film this way.  Watching the film in its original Mandarin language with subtitles captures the full essence of the film.

Normally I do not enjoy movies with subtitles, but in this case the subtitles seem to add to the mystic of the film. There has been much debate about the floating effect of the fight scenes, and for the first few seconds when I saw it I was first taken aback. Then as the film progressed, this special effect just added to the mystic of the film, and it seemed to fit naturally as any other special effect. Pay-per-view ran a dubbed version of the film and I watched it for about half and hour before giving up. Believe it or not, the version with the subtitles is better.

The show was sold out (as all of the previous ones were before it as well.) After seeing Ang Lee's ""Sense And Sensibility"" multiple times (I own it on laserdisc and DVD), and by having heard about the romance in the film between Yun-Fat and Leoh, I knew I was in for a treat.
Ang Lee did not disappoint. It's the perfect date movie. The subtitles keep you paying attention to the movie (instead of worrying about where to put your arm, etc.), the romantic, quiet chemistry between Yeoh and Yun-Fat will satisfy her, and the mesmerizing fight scenes will more than satisfy him. (Or vice versa if you hate clichs like I do :-) It also has more than it's fair share of comedic moments in the film.
I can't think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy this film. If you don't like subtitles, too bad.

1132666,5,7883631101,"This film has everything for everyone.  Excellent acting, great storyline, and very awesome action scenes.
I think this is the movie that would cross the gender boundaries in what movie you want to watch some night.  Going for the stereo-typical route: Women want romance... Guys want action. This movie has both!  There should be more movies in the future made like this.  It'll make those movie nights at home much better varied in selection.
I was surprised to find out that this is Chow Yun-Fat's first martial arts film.  I'm not much of a foreign film buff, but I figured that most Asian action film stars started off in either martial arts films or gun-based action films and getting to do both as they grew as an actor.
I've only seen a few films with Michelle Yeoh (Crouchin Tiger, SuperCop 2, a James bond film).  I just love watching her kick butt and have a passionate emotional side to her acting.
And since Amazon.com failed to add her to the ""Cast list""..  Zhang Ziyi (say it like it's spelled... there you go!) is a really sexy actress.  I swear she's gonna do some very awesome films in English once she's learned the language a bit more.  I think everyone should keep an eye out for her films.  It's a shame about how her character in Rush Hour2 came to a conclusion.  I would be nice to have some hope she'll come back and beat down on Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan some more.
I just love martial arts films.  I used to watch the horrid, but entertaining martial arts films on the USA Network when they had a ""Kung-Fu Theatre"" type show.  I wish they'd bring it back.  I haven't gotten to see the other movies Ang Lee has done, but after watching this masterpiece, I'm going to go rent some other movies directed by him.
Putting in this DVD the first time was funny.  The standard language is Mandarin/Chinese with English Subtitles.  I'm sorry, but I prefer the voice overs in english with no subtitles.  One day when I've learned more than one language, or when I'm bored.. I'll put it on Mandarin/Chinese with no subtitles.  Probably even teach me to speak the language.  heh.
My other little problem was the wire work.  Could have done a bit more in fluid movements of the actors as they're being pulled around on the wires.  The kicking in the air like you're running on it isn't all that great to see.  The actors should go from a crouched position to a entended jump pose, then on the way to a solid object to ""bounce"" or land on, have some sense of gravity and weight to the landings.  The way it is in the movie, it's more like a fighting game than something that's more real.
This title is a must for anyone who owns a DVD player.  It's a sad thing if you don't have this in your collection.  Everyone should get this movie so that their collection will grow as scarily large as my own. (as of Nov 2001- 45 DVD movies)

Then I was blown away! First of all, all of the actors in this movie are experienced in martial arts, it's not fake or purely choreographed. And considering the astounding choreography of this movie, that's saying quite a bit.
Beyond the mind-blowing fight scenes, however, this is not the normal martial arts movie. It departs in the fact that most of the main characters are women (and every fight scene has at least one woman). There's also a slightly fantastic element that is tastefully contained; it is easier to believe the almost-flying ability of the characters than it is to dismiss it.
What most impressed me about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, however, was the concentration on spiritual and mental aspects. Instead of showing martial arts as a merely physical exercise, it addresses the teachings of martial arts to become mentally and spiritually in control of oneself, and more in tune with the outside world. Its message of love and being true to oneself is subtle and moving, as supported by an outstanding musical score (with Yo Yo Ma on cello.) As for the ending, if you think it is only about death, then I suggest you watch it again.

Anyone who has read my reviews knows I believe cinematography and soundtrack are huge for me. Director Ang Lee has poured both into the senses. The darkness of Peking's  alleyways to the brilliant greens of the bamboo forests create moods of mystery, and the walking on treetops reinforces the magic of the moment. This movie is touching, filled with action, and envelopes you. Watch this movie in the English version the first time. This way, you can enjoy the color and story of a legendary hero, his true love he cannot confess to, and the devestation that is wrought by a selfish girl bent on elevating herself above all for the sake of her own ego. The trailers did great justice to this movie. Not only did they expose the fantastic effects, they gave you the feeling of the entrapment involved in the ancient Chinese caste system. I will NOT ruin this movie by disclosing the dual `love lost' theme. Anyone who writes a review and gives away the plot of the movie should be hung. This film needs to be experienced without expectation. The atmosphere is completely mystical. The characters, a legendary swordsman, a female anti-hero who studied the martial arts for the goal of self destruction, a selfish princess and her lover from the past, are all the reader need know.

By the time I left thbe theatre, I was honestly overwelmed with so many different thoughts.  The fact that the film was in a different language was irrelevant, and because of it I cannot watch the film in english.  The DVD version allows for a rather annoying dubbing of english launguage.  Put the Subtitles on, and watch the natural film.  This truly is going to become an epic in years to come.

Enough said. I criticize this film for the many times that it seems to focus on technical wows and high wire antics, often at the expense of potentially great drama.  Chow Yun Fat's words in his final scene all make up for it though.  This would be a truly great movie with less hidden wires and more Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together.

You can also see the cables they use to do their stunts.  This movie was unrealistic and you can't picture anything in real life with that!

In this action-packed film, men are not the best fighters, the man and woman do not live happily ever after and the Christian ethic does not support the themes. Instead the ethic of the Buddhist monk provides the subtle webbing that holds the ideas together. Exciting new concepts of spiritual enlightenment make the gravity-defying flying (like Matrix) somehow nearly believable.

Those that ripped it obviously have a very Immature mindset or were unable to suspend disbelief for the sake of a great movie.  The movie was Deep, moving and very very entertaining.  Sure the warriors in it could fly, so what!  I am quite amazed that the professional ctitics gave it such good reviews because of the fanciful nature of it all.  But of course most all Martial Arts Movies are Fanciful in one way or another, in fact, all movies are fanciful with very very few exception.  If movies were realistic then nobody would go and see them.  We go to the movies to escape reality for a few hours and this movie does that for you brilliantly.  The Acting is beyond adequate but I will not say it is Great, it is simply Very Good.  The action scenes are fun and intense, not overly violent but they depict the struggle of the characters.  The Plot is deep and layered but only if you choose to see the depth, fortunatly that is not necessary to enjoy the movie.  The scenery is breathtaking.  I do not know how much I can say that has not already been said in the reviews before me.  Just that If you hated the movie then you simply did not get it.  It is an action/romance/drama/fantasy movie.  If you want nothing but fight scenes then get a Bruce Lee movie, you will be far more pleased.

This is by no stretch of the imagination a ""Kung Fu flick"" which is how it was marketed and how it was pitched to me by friends who loved it. What it does have going for it, though, is a sweet and compelling love story. It has two love stories, actually, and they're both beautiful and touching for different reasons. If you're looking for a good, rich, compelling story, this movie won't let you down. If you're looking for a kung-fu flick with realistic, visceral-yet-graceful violence, try a Bruce Lee flick.

I think Webster is going to add this as a sub-text definition to ""over-rated"" in the new edition of his dictionary.  I swore this was a joke when it first came out.

Even better, just get a Bruce Lee movie and call it quits.  At least Bruce had talent, style, humor, wit and dignity.

The plot is fairly complex and the movie altogether presents a huge setting than spans from forests to deserts and mountains. The only thing that I have already witnessed and continually worry about is fight scenes in movies being performed with wires. It was amazing and inovative to see it in Crouching Tiger but now it seems that every movie that contains fight scenes has to make use of wire contraptions to aid them. Will there come a time when no movies will be without the use of wire aperature fighting.....? I guess I can always count on Jackie Chan for his pure style of fighting and stunts.

1133416,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - Ang Lee
This film has tremendous performances from Chow Yun Fat in his first action role and Michelle Yeoh as his star crossed lover.  The fight scenes are improbably dazzling and once again Yuen Wo Ping, who choreographed The Matrix makes the film a dazzling display of movement with action sequences that literally take your breath away.
The Director, Ang Lee has made the film palatable to American and European audiences.  Check out the genre change as Jen (Zhang Ziyi) chases her lover across the desert and the film magically becomes a western.
The film is primarily about traditional Chinese society and its inability to deal with the encroaching equality of Chinese women. The three main female characters all centre around the figure of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat).  They all show different kinds of female role.  Wife, Daughter and the woman who is rejected by society for her refusal to take on one of these valid roles.
The character Jade Fox is excluded from society for stealing secret wisdom, which has only previously been available to Men. Jen is allowed this knowledge only when she redeems herself by turning to her father figure Li Mu Bai.  This shows brilliantly the struggle between Chinese women and traditional influence.

Jen, the main protagonist  is fighting against traditional Chinese values in the form of an arranged marriage.  She is a gifted martial arts expert under the tuition of the rogue Jade Fox.  Li Mu Bai  wants to teach her himself.  He takes on a patriarchal role, attempting to harness Jens' skills in a legitimate way.
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a visual masterpiece with amazing scenery and out of this world choreography.  It offers a high-quality, subtle plot with full character exploration.  The film has also won four Oscars and four Baftas, so this should be an indication of its tremendous quality.

If I only had this movie to go by, I'd conclude that the Chinese do not have emotions. The dialougue was basically recited, with no inflection or detectable emotion. As for the fights, well there's stunning moves and then there's physically impossible.  We all know that there are some things that you can't learn from Martial Arts.

There's no real pressing problem, just a few minor annoyances that people are trying to patch up. The villain does nothing to redeem the sad state that the movie villian has fallen into. I like to think that I'm more patient than your average Joe moviewise, but...this movie was too long and too bizarre.

I have no familiarity with true Chinese culture but it reminded me somewhat of the ""A Hundered Secret Senses"" by Amy Tan in terms of the introduction is offers to another way of viewing the world.
The story begins by introducing two older warriors, Shu Lien (female) and Li Mu Bai (male), members of a fighting underworld. Li Mu Bai has had an epiphany and decided to drop his warrior ways, beleiving that they will bring sorrow. He asks Su Lien to take his sword, the ancient and magical Green Destiny to an old associate in Peking. While there, she meets Jen, the daughter of the local Governer who is soon to be married.
The same night, the sword is stolen by a masked stranger who engages in a phenominal battle with Shu Lien for the sword. It is  obvious that the stranger has tremendous talent, of course the mysterious stranger turns out to be the young, impetuous Jen.  The other main characters are the mysterious Jade Fox, a warrior who killed the master of Li Mu Bai and for whom he wished to extract revenge, and Lo, the barbarian lover of Jen.
The movie revolves around the delicate love story between the two older warriors and the turmoil surrounding Jen, who causes trouble to all others as she fights against the requirements of her family and position and her own wishes to be free and to develop her talent.
The characters are beautifully played, the photography exquisite and the action scenes quite startling.

Any one of these elements by itself would make for a good film.  However, adding them all (Plus those I have forgotten) just makes for a convoluted one.  They shove all of this information at me, and because there is so much, I don't particularly care about any of it.
Perhaps a re-edit of the film would have been better.  For one thing, I hate flashbacks.  I wasn't even aware that the flashback scene in question even *was* a flashback until it ended.  The only real reason for it was to add the bandit character.  The film would have been better without him.  Don't get me wrong, he wasn't bad, but merely unnecessary.  Without him, we could have concentrated far more on the relationship between Michele Yeoh & Chow Yung Fat thereby making the ending sequence far better.
Now to be fair, as almost everybody has pointed out, the fight sequences were simply amazing.  From a western standpoint, anyway.  The film isn't really out of the ordinary back in China.

This movie is based upon the fourth novel of a five-part series by author Wang Dulu. From the very first minute of watching this movie, my senses were galloping to the world of mystical fantasy that was China. I was presented with such awe-inspiring scenery of small towns as in the 19th Century Qing Dinasty (shot in Beijing and Xinjing), to the breathtaking scenes from the beautiful and immense Gobe Desert  a suitable place to introduce the second of two romances in this story. Some of the desert scenes are reminiscent of shots from The English Patient and are nothing short of jaw dropping spectacular. I was immediately sold on the romance of China.
The story begins with the meeting of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who have always restrained their feelings for one another out of honor for Shu Liens slain husband. Li Mu Bai wants to give up his Wudan fighter days and lay to rest his revenge against Jade Fox, who killed his master. During meditation training at Wudan Mountain, Li Mu Bai encountered an endless sorrow that gripped his heart. He now wants to find peace from that sorrow by giving his masters sword, called Green Destiny to Sir Te in Peking. This sets the prelude to a fantastic story, in which the Green Destiny Sword is stolen from Sir Te and the movie follows the attempts of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien to retrieve it. That brings Shu Lien in contact with a wealthy district governors daughter, Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) who leads a strict proscribed life. From here the storyline splits into two plots, in which we get to know some history of Jen Yu and discover that under her quiet exterior there is a yearning for liberation. Yet everything is not what it seems on the surface and Jen Yu harbours a secret that is the turning point of this story.
It is indeed Jen Yu who impresses most with her young sparkling untamed spirit and beauty - a girl who longs to be a warrior and demonstrates incredible fighting prowess that leaves me gasping for more. There is a remarkable fight sequence in a restaurant that truly displays the extraordinary skills of Zhang Ziyi. Being only 19 years old, she had no previous knowledge of martial arts at the beginning of filming, and was trained completely on the spot.
At the heart of the movie is the contrast of Li Mu Bai, who throughout, uses reflection and meditation to consider his path, versus Jen, who rebels against the traditions of eastern culture and philosophy. This is evident in a fighting scene between the two, where she asks him to stop talking like a monk and fight. It is this extreme rebellion of Jen that leads to such deep despair, which leaves the viewer wondering if her character can be redeemed. It also sets the scene of a beautiful, but haunting love story between Jen and her barbarian lover Lo. For those of you who are wondering where the title Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came from, heres your answer. The name for Dragon is embedded in the script of the name of the character, Jen, which makes Lo the Tiger. The crouching and hidden parts make sense as they relate to those two characters. However, Ang Lee also stresses that every character in the film is a hidden dragon in some sense. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is also a quote from Chinese mythology. It refers to hiding your strength from others; advice which is followed too well by the main characters of the film.
The action and martial art scenes in this movie are nothing short of spectacular, as they are choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping, whose signature was all over The Matrix. The characters defy the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walk along walls and even conduct a sword fight high above 40 feet in the air clinging to the tops of tall, swaying trees, swinging back and forth. What is breathtaking is that the actors are actually there in those treetops and rooftops! Computers were used only to remove the safety wires that held the actors, and they performed the majority of the stunts themselves with their awesome athletic abilities. That is truly awesome!
Ang Lee succeeds in putting the long-established genre of Chinese Wuxia films back on the map from their previous B grading in the industry. The Wuxia were a class of knights during the time of Confucius, who, in fantasy based fiction, often have magical abilities like flight (gravity free leaps), speed, reflexes and strength of superhuman levels. China has been making these movies (called Wuxia Pien) for years, but few have had the funds or worldwide exposure of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Also, Ang Lee turns the tables on the male-dominated martial arts films by injecting it with strong female roles, the likes of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, the heroines of this movie. Ang Lee plans to eventually direct a prequel and a sequel that will address parts of the novel that didn't make it to this film. The title of the prequel may be Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin, depending on translation.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those rare films that grabs you early on and rides your senses until its immense emotional climax. It transcends any martial arts movie and becomes one of a kind, combining action and romance. Its glorious, shameless in its escapism and a true epic. The ending scenes are hauntingly wonderful. The movie can be summarised in the final words of Li Mu Bai to Shu Lien: Ive wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath that I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit.",999648000,2,5877,4.65
1133642,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based on a 70-year old novel set in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. Legendary warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) has decided to entrust his sword Green Destiny to a nobleman with the help of fellow warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) so he can turn his back on a life of war. But the sword is stolen from the nobleman's home by a cunning and skilled female thief who seems to have a connection with Jade Fox, an assasin responsible for the death of Li Mu Bai's Wudan mentor. At the time of the theft, the nobleman had the governor and his family as guests. The governor's daughter, Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), is a privileged young beauty who longs to live a life of adventure and be with Lo (Chang Chen), a bandit who initially ambushed her desert caravan but later became her lover. Through Green Destiny, these major characters' paths collide and lead to a haunting conclusion.
By focusing on its formidable female characters, Crouching Tiger showcases some of the most exciting fighting scenes ever filmed (for more on the origins of this genre, check out Wuxia). However, this is a movie that does not sacrifice substance for style. It is a delicate balance of yin and yang: epic but intimate, exhilarating but soft around the edges. It focuses on the timeless theme of good versus evil, of loyalty versus betrayal, of honor versus deceit. It celebrates both the thrill of passionate love (between Jen and Lo, the Crouching Tigers) and the grandiosity of a pure long suffering one (between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, the Hidden Dragons).
Conventional superlatives are not sufficient to describe this movie. It is just achingly exquisite on many levels. Director Ang Lee masterfully conducts this lyrical symphony: from Yuen Wo Ping's martial arts choreography to Peter Pau's cinematography to Tan Dun's musical score (accented by the haunting cello solos of Yo Yo Ma) to the remarkable performances of its actors, Crouching Tiger is a surreal experience that will leave you breathless.",999648000,4,2014,4.806916426512968

Even though I'm a huge fan of martial arts movies that involve people that can jump 50 feet or more into the air, this one didn't really impress me. In fact, it's one of the tamest martial arts movies I've ever seen.
First off, the fights are WAY too slow for a Michelle Yeoh movie. Anyone that's ever seen Wing Chun (the ULTIMATE action movie) would agree with me. I guess it isn't fair to compare Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Wing Chun in some respects, but Wing Chun IS about 5 years old. In my opinion, though, Wing Chun even puts The Matrix to shame.
Now, even though there are some pretty amusing parts in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you could get 100 times the laughs out of Wing Chun. Oh...but what about the romance? Big deal. I thought that the relationship between Invisible Girl and the Doctor in The Heroic Trio was done much better. Of course, if you like movies that involve countless fights to retrieve a comb, I guess Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is all right. Overall, I thought it was a disappointment, though.

Also the plot is simple yet the makers of the movie managed to make it so confusing. If this story would have been made into a TV series, it would have provided the neccesary time for the character's background to be described more deeply. For example, the desert bandit had absolutely not connection with the plot at all save that he knew the princess. The princess was also a unecesary character and made the story quite confusing. However, if you are not concerned for the storyline, the fight choreography and the special effects were superb. It captured(also exaggerated) the power that a trained warrior could have for example balancing on a branch and floating on water, etc...

The swordfighting scenes are very enjoyable. The music was great - tense and emotive.
I am not that maidens in ancient China ran their own businesees -a protected courier business at that.  In the Sung Dynasty, most would have been required to stay at home, not even to emerge to the great hall if there were visitors. They would not have been allowed to get into proximity with men. The same would have applied to widows, which was the official status of Michelle Yeoh's character. Did I enjoy the movie anyway? Yes, I did.

The chinese culture dates back more than 5000 years. Wuxia warriors are believed to have existed but we are not sure what they are capable of. How do they defy gravity and can fly over roof tops? hello? They practice kong-fu since they are very small. One of the ways is to tie heavy rocks on your feet for several years and get used to running and walking with the rocks on. So when you take them off, you can obviously jump higher. People, don't be so narrow minded. Many things can be done ...don't make quick judgements based on the limited knowledge that you are exposed to. Remember? We landed on the moon.

She shows this with dignity while not shoving it into our faces. Again, Lee wows us with his artistic touch.  Third, CHOW YUN-FAT! How can anyone be indifferent to him???  In this film, he IS Li Mu Bai, a man filled with conflict, sadness and a knowledge of ""wasted time.""

This is one of the most astounding things I've seen in a long time.  It's part martial-arts/date movie, part courtly love story/martial-arts movie, if that makes any sense.  The fight scenes have to be the most incredible I've ever seen, and they're couched in such a great plot, and with some of the most beautiful settings.  For all the fighting, none of it comes off as gratuitous because it's all choreographed like a ballet, and there's conspicuously little bloodshed.
 Oh, and at some point, Chow Yun-Fat grew straight out of his annoying Hollywood sneer and into the role of a wise master.  The real star, however, has to be Ms. Zhang.  The restarant scene (""I am the invincible sword godess!"") is worth the price of admission alone.
 On dvd, this film looks just spiffy.  The picture is good and clear without any visible edge enhancement, and the colors (which Ang Lee uses to great effect) are vivid without being over-saturated.  The audio, especially the really cool music by Yo-Yo Ma, is perfectly clear.
 My only gripe, and it's a small one, is with the relatively anemic extras.  The commentary's nice, but it mentions twenty minutes of cut scenes, none of which are on this disc.  There's a neat television documentary that shows how some of the choreography was done, and there's also a suprisingly good English-language dub, although I prefer the Mandarin with subtitles.

Suffice to say, things get complicated from there.

The action sequences in this film border on stunning (the woman-to-woman fight in the dojo definitely ranks up there as one of my favorite action scenes ever), and the photography (definitely worth winning an Oscar for) was nothing less than beautiful.  Even though the ending itself appears to be open to a lot of interpretation, I have to admit this is one of those epics that doesn't insult my intelligence (although I have to admit clichd lines like ""You will pay for my master's death"" and so forth did give me a slight chuckle upon hearing them) and manages to be quite intoxicating.

This movie has elements of many genres in it and would suit practically anyone's tastes. It's a love story but don't worry if you're not into that sort of thing the action scenes more than make up for it. There are many people who think that the action scenes aren't up to scratch with the action scenes of a traditional Hong Kong martial arts fantasy film. I disagree however but if you haven't been exposed to many of these films it wouldn't matter at all. Also, I wouldn't miss seeing this film just because it doesn't fit in with the traditional conventions of the genre. I guess as a person who does not speak Chinese I can't place a judgement on the acting in the sense of the general expression of speech of this film but to me it didn't seem to matter, the actors were able to convey all of their emotions not with their voice but with their facial expressions particularly their eyes. Everything about this film is beautiful from the costumes right down to the harsh scenery of the desert. The action sequences are great and I enjoyed the magical/fantasy element of the film, ie the flying and the ending of the film which I don't want to spoil for people who haven't seen it.

I particularly recommend the special feature on the making of the movie, because it both tells you a lot that is not obvious from the finished result and increases your appreciation of the film.",997747200,2,630,4.761467889908257

That is totally ridiculous. ""Gladiator"" was a summer blockbuster but it also was a movie with compelling sympathetic charcaters and incredible action. Crowe's Maximus is a lovable characte who captures people's hearts. The same thing can not be said about anyone in ""Crouching Tiger"". This film is filled with irritating awful characters who I didn't care at all about. The young girl in the film is downright annoying. Also, the special effects of this movie are so overrated it isn't even funny. We have all seen the same type of effects in Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies. Why is this one so special???

The only way you can be underwhelmed by this movie is if you do nothing but watch the greatest fighting movies available or actually live in Hong Kong and get to see them released. I thought Ang Lee's film ""the Ice Storm"" had great potential and beautiful cinematography, so when I heard...that this visual genius got hold of Chow Yun-Fat back in 99, the drooling commenced.

1134012,4,7883631101,"Ang Lee's martial arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" earned its niche in movie history as the first foreign language film ever to gross over $100 million dollars at the U.S./Canadian box office.  It is, of course, a film of other distinctions as well.
The factor that sets this film apart from all previous martial arts films is, principally, the fight scenes themselves, which involve the characters defying the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walking along walls and even conducting a sword fight high above the tree tops of a windswept forest.  These sequences, which achieve a sort of heightened surrealism, are indeed breathtaking to behold in their originality, boldness and technical perfection.  They provide the unforgettable imagery that very few films these days seem able to achieve, giving the audience the all too rare sense that it is seeing something wholly new and visionary.
Based on a novel by Du Lu Wang,  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" tells a quite fascinating story of a stolen sword and the attempts of two warriors, one a man, the other a woman, to retrieve it.  Like most movies set in an Asian past, Lee's film conveys a tone of quiet contemplation, even when great issues of war and peace, life and death, duty and honor are being fought over and discussed.  There is a lyrical, poetic beauty to much of this film, even - or, perhaps I should say, especially - in the non-martial arts sequences.  As the two warriors, Chow Yun Fat, a fighter grown weary of his past and yearning for the quiet rewards of peace, and Michelle Yeoh, a woman unique to her profession yet feeling deeply her unrequited love for the man she follows, bring a sturdy maturity to their complex roles.  They provide the human warmth that, in the first section of the film, in particular, keeps the work rooted in reality.
Unfortunately, there is a scene about an hour into the movie, when a young aristocratic woman, destined to be married but yearning for the liberation that would come with being a warrior, has a long romantic flashback, chronicling her strange affair with a handsome young barbarian.  Although the scene ends up being crucial to the understanding of the rest of the film, it really isn't on an intellectual par with the main story of the film, coming across instead as something of an embarrassing bodice-ripper in tone and style.  Although the film does return to its main plotline eventually, it never completely recovers from the detour it has taken.  As with most movies with a midpoint sag, the audience is never really able to completely tune back in.  What a pity - for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" clearly has the elements to make a truly great film (and, judging from the reaction of many critics and writers on this site, a large number of people feel it is).  Luckily, after the flashback, the film manages to get back on track, as we witness the complex interplay between the unthinking arrogance that comes with youth and the restraining wisdom that comes with age.  This is the most powerful theme that runs through this visually gorgeous film.
Thus, despite its minor imperfections, any lover of cinema would be well advised to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for the many wonders it contains.",997401600,9,3258,4.825852782764811

Yes, I admit, the cinemtogrphy, art direction, casting, and music were great. It's eye candy if nothing else. But I feel this films lacks a decent plot, and substance. The only part I liked was the 'fantasy' side of the film, where the girl dives off in the end. Other than that it's really not that profound. There are better novels to make films from.
Oh, I was also repelled by the flying actions in this film. That's some BS if i've ever seen one! Okay, I'm starting to sound like a snob, but people can't fly! I don't care if you are great masters!

I go to the movies quite frequently and not since Raiders of the Lost Ark has a movie blown me away like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Yes, it is that good.

You cannot throw reality out the window when you create a fantasy film. It also didn't end right. The girl was a horrible person, and the film may have been more believable if the guy jumped. Besides, she didn't jump, she flew. And she didn't have a pure heart with which to make that kind of sacrifice. It was more like a slap in the face. I didn't appreciate it and came away from the film disgusted.
It would have been much better if the main character didn't die. That, also, was a cheap shot and a lot of hooey. I wasn't all that sad to tell the truth. By then I was just angry that the film was dragging on so long.
The fight scenes were okay, though. They were obviously fake and didn't hold much water for me, but some people were impressed. My friend (who is from Korea and used to watching films like this) was extremely disappointed.

1134101,5,7883631101,"I disagree with the reviewers who complain that this movie is nothing more than another martial arts movie.  This movie combines its own mythology with the atmosphere of ancient China and the timeless themes of honor and love.  There's plenty of action for those who like fast paced films, but there's also depth and excellent acting/characterizations for those of us who want to take more away from a movie than a few entertaining hours.
To greatly simplify the plot: a business woman who is also a warrior (despite the taboos of both) arrives in Beijing with a legendary sword entrusted to her by the man she loves.  When the sword is stolen, a heart-racing series of events are set into motion.  The sword must be recovered, the culprit caught, order restored. Beneath the surface, the unfilled love between the aging business woman and the owner of the sword simmers, especially as the story of a headstrong young noblewoman unfolds.
Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeon, as the platonic and honor-bound couple, play their roles with quiet confidence, giving their characters extraordinary range with the smallest of gestures.  Even newcomer Zhang Ziyi carries her role as the stubborn and talented daughter of a dignitary with aplomb.  Ang Lee has directed a winner that deserves a place among classics.  I am completely amazed at his ability to stage the dramatic battle scenes, evoke an ancient culture, and still inject a tremendous amount of humanity in what is, at its most basic, an action film.  The result is a warm and lyrical tale, visually stunning and heartfelt.
I know much has been made of the special effects used to animate the fighting.  To those who say its lack of realism detracts from the movie, I say you missed the point.  The gravity defying leaps and the straight-up-the-wall running highlight the mythology.  We are meant to take these events not only literally but as symbols of something greater.
The DVD provides special features that are all well done and interesting, although, as with all DVD's, I wish they were more substantial.

I saw Crouching Tiger in the theater and actually sat through two performances in a row.  I just could not take the whole experience in in one sitting - it left me visually stunned.  Because I was outvoted at home, the first time I viewed the DVD, we used the English version, and although I still found the film to be exciting, it wasn't quite as enjoyable as is the original Chinese version.
There is little I can say to add to the multitude of voices that have reviewed this film.  I found the director's vision to be so vast and complex that is was astounding.  The window it opened to the beauty of central China  was incredible.  Lee was definitely in control of the pacing and of the performances of his cast, which are outstanding, but pale in comparison to the texture of the story and the backdrop of what is China.
This is one of those films where words fail to describe the experience, and gushing praise just makes others who view the film wonder ....""What's all the fuss about?"".  If you view it as a martial arts film, or a historical romance, or an epic, each view is too limited.  It is all of these things, and more.
Crouching Tiger will be in my list of the top 5 films of all time for many years to come.  Ang Lee is brilliant.",997228800,10,1379,4.252873563218391

It's good to see a film that's not made with the American premise of a ""feel good"" ending. Though depending on your state of mind, you may feel either way regarding this. The actors are good. The story line, is good. The cinematography is good.

First, it's in Chinese (Duh).

Many love the movie and find it breath taking, but I can't help feel sad some are missing the message. In chinese culture, flying around, supernatural martial arts and walking on bamboo is an integral part of the culture. In the same way comics permeate American culture, martial arts touches every part of dailey life. The deeper message of personal vs social, good vs evil, and order vs chaos are universal conflicts. Although the names, powers and costumes are different, the conflicts are the same. I love the movie and find it paints a delicate portrait of what it means to be an individual in chinese culture. Individualism is always tempered by society, but the manifestation depends on the location. A lot of reviews criticize the movie's long dialogs on taoism, but it would be like a movie about jesus christ that never mentions christianity. Within the dialog is the subtext of repressed emotions and hidden desires. Many people find it pointless and stupid because American culture believes in individual expression. The poetry of the dialog is aparent to those who know the language. Translating chinese poetry is nearly impossible, even though some of the greatest American writers spend their entire lives striving to achieve it. The structure and syntax of chinese language is completely different. Things like conjugation, past perfect, present perfect and past perfect do not exist in chinese.

I could see this film over and over again: Once at least, to soak in the drama, action and atmosphere; once to savour the poetic Mandarin dialogue (such as: Jen, ""And this little boy who fails to find his star turns instead to stealing my comb."" Lo, ""I'm a man now, and I've found myself the brightest star.""); once just to wallow in the haunting score; and once to focus on Zhang Ziyi alone ...
... her sweet curious innocence as an aristocrat's daughter ...  her poise yet potency in battle ... her tearful defiance under the strain of force from her pursuers ... her petulant pout ... and her feeble resistance to submission while in a drug-induced stupor - I just love that scene of her eyes welling in tears as she was on the verge of being unveiled.
No, the Oscar will not stand up to your talent, Ziyi, and this is only your second film!

1134225,5,7883631101,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is, without any equivocation, a dazzling martial arts picture which has somewhat revived a moribund genre. Kung fu films have, in general, undergone some considerable decline in recent years, with the exception of Hong Kong superstar Jet Li attempting to breath life into the stagnating line of formula-plotted bone-breaking fests. Credit must also go to Ang Lee for electing to do add a slightly innovative and unconventional touch to the genre. The cheesy dubbed dialogue (which translates poorly and hilariously) is jettisoned in favour of the original Chinese language subtitled into English, thus preserving the film's main saving grace, its culture. While mainstream kung fu afficionoados have grown weary of production-line plotlines generally involving the hero's lost mother/brother/pet goldfish, ""Crouching Tiger..."" eschews all of these stereotypes and sets about creating a truly authentic atmosphere. Lee's directorial style, incorporating balletic action sequences, high-octane martial arts feats is a marvel, and every minute detail is captured with a lovingness that most directors simply lack. The fight sequences are stunningly choreographed and the ""flying"" episodes appear intriguing. While Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi's treetop battle has been, in my opinion, much overrated, an even more absorbing martial arts encounter was that between Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien and Ziyi's Jen. Both instances, both in the courtyard and the dojo are, quite unreservedly, the greatest martial arts displays ever captured on celluloid. Wo Ping's sequencing and choreography of the fight scenes is nonpareil, excelling even the work of the late, great Bruce Lee. The film is one of the best films ever made, devoted kung fu fans are strongly recommended to see it. Production standards (e.g. art direction, set design, costumes and cinematography) are all of the higest order.",996451200,9,1912,5.619377162629758

1134347,4,7883631101,"This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon).  There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can't seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, &#8220;Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.&#8221;
On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.
Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).  By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn't commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li's desire to mentor Jen, Jen's relationship with Jade Fox, Jen's relationship with Yu, Jen's progress as a warrior, Jen's adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen's pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn't add that much to the main themes.
The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.
Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its ... U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like &#8220;Scary Movie&#8221; exemplify).  Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing.",996364800,3,3186,4.841328413284133

1134349,4,7883631101,"i don't how many of you guys out there are actually familiar with Ang Lee and his works, but if you aren't, get familiar with it!  The man is a pure genius!  there are so many other aspects of this film that ang lee wanted to get across, but the cinematography  was so gorgeous and so was the soundtrack and almost every other visual  aspect of his film that the true lessons and such are sort of pushed into the background.  but the thing with ang lee is that he tries his best to incorporate some intellectual stimulation into his films as well, something that will have the viewers thinking about it hours after they've seen the film.  he creates a world that you feel you can slip into and become a part of.
now for the actors.  i have been a long hard core fan of Chow Yun Fat.  what can i say, the man is a genius, the only problem is that he tends to play the same role in every movie, but that's alright because he does it sssoooooo well. the thing with asian actors who have gone and done american movies is that they are usually casted as kung fu fighting machines ( e.g. jakie chan, jet li, sammo hung, etc. ) and they....i'm sorry if it offends anyone...cannot act for crap.  chow yun fat on the other hand, is one of the best asian actors out there.  i've seen his movies and cried! he's sooo touching and he did very well in this fillm.  he should get more recognition in the states!  michelle yeoh did a great job in this movie, what can i say she absolutely phenomenol, she's been in a lot of other american movies as well so she really brought some more media attention when they were advertising this film in the states. and ziyi zang i think her name is? gosh! she was basically the star of the movie okay? she annoys you, enchants you, betrays you, and yet you still love her and pity her all the way through the film. she's just plain great! you see the strength in her, just in the power of her eyes, and yet you see her immaturity and her ignorance of the power she posesses and you feel sorry for her, and yet her actions are so rash and impetous that you wish michelle would just kill her and get it over with. in the end ziyi completely suprises us all!
now some critism...the movie did loose a lot of his true beauty because of all the hype it recieved. the intellectual aspect of the movie was completely crushed and destroyed, and the flash back in the middle of the movie completely threw me off: i was like....wait a second..how did they get in the desert again?? *lol* needless to say i watched this dvd a few times in order to understand everything completely.  And if you do get this dvd, definately watch it with the english subtitles, that's how a foreign film SHOULD  be watched....and also watch the director's commentaries there are a lot of things bout the movie that you'll not notice. like foot prints in the desert that AREN'T supposed to be there but they made a mistake. those kindas cool little facts and infos.  this dvd is definately a keeper!",996192000,,2991,4.306595365418895

1134354,5,7883631101,"While this film may on the surface appear to be a martial arts film, it is not really part of that genre. This is why East Asians frequently pan this film. It is not a martial arts film despite what the trailers may lead one to believe. Rather, it is a multi-layer psychological love story involving several different people. It is also highly atmospheric. In this manner it combines some of the best features of European character oriented films and Japanese films concerning either atmosphere or emotion with plot elements sufficiently strong for North American markets.
Regardless, this is a fine film. However, do not be surprised if your Asian friends are not taken with it in terms of the martial arts genre. In those terms, the film is a bit shop worn and even a bit hokey. The fact that, unlike a Jackie Chan film, this film takes itself very seriously, makes its deficiencies as a martial arts film more pronounced.",996192000,,924,4.709876543209877
1134355,3,7883631101,". . . perfectly describes my reaction to this movie.  I don't usually come away from a film without a clear-cut sense, but I just couldn't get a handle on CTHD.  There were many things I admired about it.  Despite what many reviewers have described as cheesy action scenes, especially the air walking/running, I found these sequences to be very convincing.  Ok, maybe all the technical aspects such as the lighting weren't perfect, but Ang Lee managed to evoke the perfect sensibility with them.  In fact, my strongest impression coming away from this film was that cinematically it depicted an authentic, deeply realized cultural sensibility.  What that sensibility was, I really don't know.  It remains a mystery to me.  If I watched it a lot more times, I think I could begin to tease out exactly what it is.  However, the movie didn't engage me thoroughly enough to want to watch it over and over.
I also admired the performances of Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi, and I thought the pacing was brilliant.
That's about it for the positive elements.  On the minus side, I found certain aspects of the story quite difficult to follow.  Character motivations often seemed opaque or murky.  I'm willing to concede that this may be because as a westerner I had trouble getting on board with what to an easterner may be perfectly clear.  On the other hand, maybe the movie just isn't very well done here.  I've seen lots of other films by oriental film makers and generally haven't had this problem.  I thought the ending was gratuitously open-ended.  Here again, it just may be that I didn't fully discern what was going on.  But I doubt it.  And althought the desert scene was quite remarkable cinematically, as well as providing important character motivation/information, there seemed a faint whiff of exploitation about it.
All in all, my heart would probably want to rate CHTD four and a half or five stars and my head one and a half or two stars.  Unfortunately, I can't get my head and heart together on this one, hence the three star rating.",996105600,,2060,4.735955056179775

It was certainly an enjoyable evening spent.

The part that didn't totally satisfy me was the fantasy parts such as walking on walls and flying through the air.  I thought the cables were well hidden, but I don't think there should have been as much flying.  It detracted from the movie's otherwise enjoyable sequence.

Moms and dads let their children shoot people because they do not have the simple dicipline to keep them out of reach. God is written in the constitution (look that up too), as he was the reason we founded this country. From Him, we have values, moral standards, and education. But, we have fallen away as I stated.

You may be wondering why I am speaking so strongly in the favor of this movie? Well, simple. Culture. In East Asia, they do everything because of it. I know because I was there. I learned the culture of a nation that is just waking up to modernization. They are deeply rooted in their lifestyle of peace and harmony with nature. I am not Asian.

1134594,4,7883631101,"I would've given this movie 4.5 stars, were that possible - it is excellent on several counts, but the feeling that i had at the end of it all was one of dissatisfaction - basically, it builds up expectations, but then lets you down towards the very end. Also the middle portion of the movie tends to drag a bit ....
First, the many pluses -
(1)Direction : Of the highest order, for the most part. Ang lee  has done a near-perfect job of most of the movie, but for the minor flaws pointed out below. It is only fair to say he's created a 'near-masterpiece'.Not to forget the fact that he's delivered the biggest ever blockbuster from China, no mean feat in itself.
(2)Performances : Outstanding - All the main characters have excelled themselves. Chow Yun Fat has essayed the role a great Wu-dan master with a quiet dignity, making his presence felt effectively without resorting to any theatrics. Ditto Michelle Yeoh - both have played mature, 'evolved' , heroic figures. All their talent & experience is on display here, but sadly underutilized, in my opinion. The surprise packet of the movie is Zhang Ziyi, who plays a challenging part with panache. Her prowess at martial arts belies her frail appearance and even overshadows her emoting. And she's quite an eyeful, too :-)
(3)Cinematography : Excellent. The film is chockfull of breathtaking visuals, and a delight to behold, frame after frame.
(4)Special Effects : Literally so. The master craftsmen responsible for the stunning sequences in 'The Matrix' are at it again, coming up with dizzying action, though some of it does require a 'suspension of disbelief' in order to be digested.
(5)Music : Good - blends perfectly with the flow of the narrative.
Wow, i'm really raving about the movie, right ? Then why only four stars ? This is why - after really raising your expectations with all these pluses (not to mention all those glittering reviews, nominations and awards that already had you expecting the moon before you even sat down to watch it ), the movie lets you down on at least two fronts :
(1)Characterisation : Zhang Ziyi's character, which gets the maximum footage by far, is not really developed properly. There are no plausible reasons for the extreme angst so clearly experienced by her character, making some of her acts seem almost mindless. The viewer is left guessing as to what possibly could her motives be for several of her decisions/acts ....... also the character of the desert robber who becomes her lover seems both irrelevant & poorly etched.
(2)Continuity : The middle portion, which concentrates on the affair between Ziyi & the robber, is way too long with respect to its contribution to the story. Not only does this disrupt the flow of the narrative and make the movie too lengthy, it also takes us away from the other two chief protagonists for far too long. It would've been far better to develop the roles of Chow Yun Fat & Michelle Yeoh more fully, and perhaps explore their complex relationship.
(3)Ending : While i don't want to give it away, it did leave me feeling unsated.

What I didn't like was that I had no idea what was going on when these people just started flying around and were able to climb buildings like spiders. Don't get me wrong, I love science-fiction and fantasy movies, but this was just wierd and that's what ruined it for me.
This movie wasn't all bad it did have an OK story line, but it didn't make it one of my favorite stories of all time.

1134751,1,7883631101,"For some reason, this movie caught the eye of movie critics across the nation and held these same critics in rapture. Review after review touted this as one of the best films of 2000. I just don't get it.
For one thing, the ""gravity-defying fight scenes"" look ludicrous. The actors dangle and wave their legs ineffectually as they are swung on a wire up walls and over roofs and, my God, even through the TREETOPS. I have heard some critics refer to these as ground breaking special effects. However, they've been hanging people on a wire and swinging them around since the fifties-just go see any musical theater production of Peter Pan. The only difference here is that post-production completely removes the wires from visibilty while creating the visual equivalent of a Chinese Peter Pan on steroids.
If you get past the silly, impossible fight scenes you will have to endure a convoluted, ponderous plot that is difficult to follow and even more difficult to stay awake through.
Am amusing side note is that the male machismo running rampant in Hollywood's productions of late is adopted by the FEMALE characters in this movie. Most of the main characters in this film are women who kick butt. Nothing wrong with that although the women in this film at times engage in gratuitous violence, violence that has no involvement in furthering the plot. In one scene, the female heroine is harassed by a few bad guys while trying to dine in a tavern. She could have just kicked and punched a few times and that would have been enough to put them in their place. Instead, our heroine has to fight EVERYONE in the tavern and ends up making the entire second floor of the building collapse, all the while bragging aloud about how great she is.
As far as the DVD itself  goes the movie does have some beautiful cinematography with gorgeous landscapes and florid costumes that put the picture quality of DVD to good use. The film was recorded in Chinese and you have a choice between English subtitles or an English dubbed version. Trying to follow the plodding story line and the subtitles simultaneously would drive a person to insanity. The dubbing is well done for dubbing but, of course, with the dubbed version the actors' mouths are not sychronized exactly to the soundtrack which is also somewhat distracting The dubbed soundtrack also has that inevitable wooden quality.
In short, only hard core martial arts film fans who can suspend logic and forget about the laws of gravity will find much to enjoy here.",995328000,10,2509,4.767816091954023
1134752,4,7883631101,"I have been waiting for someone to release a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for maybe ten years.  I had hoped it would be an American film but I think it fitting it was something in the middle. Ang Lee has been directed the outstanding film Sense and Sensibilities which is amazing considering it is a perfectly British feeling 19th century English country romance-comedy-drama. In spite of this success continues to make Chinese language films like ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" that have had a small but enthusiastic following here.  For me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was nothing new. Even though I am a pasty white boy, I have had the privilege of enjoying Chinese fantasy adventure films before.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has finally introduced America to a genre of film that has been long enjoyed in China. And in particular I believe to a great extent the film is an homage to the artistry of the great Chinese director Tsui Hark (pronounced Choy Hock)who has been orchestrating elaborate choreography such as this in forests, cities and buildings for years. Crouching Tiger is a blend of Sense and Sensibility and the films of Tsui Hark and others directors in that tradition.  It is therefore no accident that suddenly but quietly appearing on the DVD shelves of all your Blockbuster Video stores are the best known films of Tsui Hark.  Once Upon a Time in China and the Swordsman series.  Unlike most American films the sequels, Once Upon a Time in China 2 and Swordsman 2 are considered the best films. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon you will also thrill to Swordsman 2 just as much.  The choreography is often even more spectacular than what you have seen. Squadrons of ninjas whorl and fly through the forests displaying powers you have not even imagined. And like Crouching Tiger, men and women (and men-women in some cases) are on an equal footing. I have heard it said that once you have seen Alien or Aliens and jumped out of your seat, the only way to recapture that experience is to see the film with a friend who hasn't seen the film yet and watch them jump out of their skin.  For me it was kind of wonderful listening to the audience applaud after watching the rooftop chase.  Obviously it was the first time my audience had ever seen anything like that. So while it was not as amazing to me having seen similar it was very cool knowing this was an eye opener for many uninitiated.  I hope some people will be inspired to take a chance and watch the films that inspired Crouching Tiger.  Hopefully it will usher in inovative styles of action films in the U.S..  It already has if you have seen ""The Matrix.""",995328000,4,2655,4.661670235546039

This movie is complete with action, compeling story, and beautiful camera work.  It has some of the most unique action work done since The Matrix.  While some might argue that since wires were used for them, I do not believe that it detracts from the movie.  I believe everyone should view this movie at least once to see what it is all about.

It was quite obvious that the actors were suspended by wires.

For hours afterward, I could hardly think of anything else. This magnificent film is an emotionally draining experience, but worth every minute. The fight scenes-- I hesitate to call them ""fight scenes,"" as that description hardly does them justice-- are indescribably beautiful, and magnificently choreographed by master Yuen Wo-Ping. Many people unfamiliar with Chinese film regard ""The Matrix"" as the pinnacle of action choreography, and ""CT,HD"" is hard evidence that this is not so. ""The Matrix"" is a fine film, but the balletic battles of ""CT,HD"" are far beyond anything that film achieves. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has become my second-favorite film of all time; my all-time favorite is ""Casablanca,"" so that should give you an idea of the distinguished company this film can keep.  From the very first chord of Tan Dun's magnificent score, ""CT,HD"" is an enthralling cinematic experience. The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat and the ever-delightful Michelle Yeoh, along with the captivating Zhang Ziyi, make up one of the most incredible casts I've ever seen.  Keep in mind that I've seen several thousand films, ranging from ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" to ""The Usual Suspects"" to ""Hello, Dolly,"" and beyond those. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has a well-deserved place among the very best of them, and will stand as an all-time classic.",995155200,8,1468,5.269230769230769
1134920,5,7883631101,"...If you're expecting a mindless, violent Hong Kong-style chop-socky extragavanza, I strongly suggest you look somewhere else. And if you're expecting to see a Matrix-style science-fiction/fantasy film, I definitely advise you to look somewhere else. This is not a good film to watch if you're looking for vicarious thrills.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(CTHD) is a serious drama wrapped in the guise of a Wuxia martial arts film. It deals with issues such as love, devotion, honour, duty...many concepts that our modern society seems to have devalued or simply forgotten. No wonder this film got such a panning from internet critics - I guess this film doesn't really deal in anything modern audiences would consider ""important"".
I felt that this was a film where the 'special effects' such as the wire-work stunts were secondary to the real special effect - the actors. Zhang Ziyi is the obvious standout, she's received plenty of raves for her outstanding performance. However, I feel that not enough credit has been paid to Michelle Yeoh and Chow-Yun Fat. Both have roles that require measured, understated performances. Their characters may not garner as much attention as young Jen(Zhang Ziyi), but they (and their relationship) are the foundation of this film.
Every aspect of this film is a credit to its creators - Ang Lee and his collaborators should be proud to have produced such a brilliant film. This is not the kind of film that will win instant accolades from everyone. It challenges every single stereotypical element we've come to expect of Asian martial arts films...and succeeds brilliantly. If it were possible to give ten out of five stars, I would. If you're a viewer that's sick and tired of unoriginal, dull and boring cinema, and want to be challenged and invigorated by something totally different, then I definitely reccommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

If chopsocky is what you're looking for, this may not satisfy you. The fight sequences are wonderful, but they're less about amazing feats of martial athleticism than they are about revealing the dreamy underpinning to the martial arts--as an example, consider the fight among the bamboo treetops. Also, the double plotting requires more attention than kungfu movies usually do; and it is truly difficult to fathom the significance of the girl's sacrifice. It has an air of enigma that may seem authentically Chinese to some, even if some Chinese don't recognize it.

I don't understand why so many Americans give this movie a 5 star.  Why? Is it because the Americans never watched Martial Art movies before?  When this movie was shown in China, Taiwan or Hong kong, it receives more critics than praises.
To tell the truth, the fighting scene in this movie has lots of flaws.  In all other martial arts or kkung-fu  movies, people don't fly like the way it is in this movie. The director Li An dosn't know anything about Chinese kung-fu.  The story of this movie isn't good at all.  I am a Chinese and I watched the Chinese version, but I don't even know what is the point of this movie after wasting 2 hours of my time!!

1134926,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a truly fascinating film.  It stands above other kung-fu films which its dramatic story, and stands above other dramas with its amazing wushu sequences.  So where does it belong?  You decide.
Li Mu Bai, played by the incredible Chow Yun Fat, is a Wudan swordsman and warrior.  After years of fighting, he simply desires to leave his violent past behind and achieve enlightenment.  He is, however, held back by his magical sword, the Green Destiny, a 400 year old blade that harbor remarkable power (and some cool sound effects).  In an attempt to free himself from bloodshed, he asks his companion and fellow fighter Shu Lien, played by the gracefully beautiful Michelle Yeoh, to give the Green Destiny to an old friend when she journeys to Peking.  But when the sword is stolen by the mysterious Jen, daughter of a governer and played by striking and lovely Zhang Ziyi, revenge, honor and love collide, along with a few kicks and blades.
Ang Lee masterfully directs this fairy tale based on a book with the same title.  Though the story is overdone and often overly dramatic in places, it is simply amazing.  In an interview, Ang Lee stated that he did not care if it was cheesy or cliched...This was the film he wanted to make.
The film is photographed by Peter Pau, whose previous work includes The Killer, and is simply beautiful.  the landscapes are breathtaking, and the architecture is magnificent.  the wushu sequences are choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, famous for his fight design in The Matrix, Fist of Legend and Tai Chi Master.  His ballet-like fights are superb, and stand out even among his other work.  The music and drums of Tan Dun and Yo-Yo Ma fit the film perfectly, and add much to the inspiring visuals. All of the actors give outstanding performances, and even their martial arts techniques are correct and look top-notch (a feat since neither Zhang Ziyi or Chow Yun Fat are martial artists like Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh).
The film is not perfect.  As stated before, the story can be slightly ridiculous at times, and the subtitle translations are not always right on target (though they are far better than the dubbed track, which sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom).  The entire desert chapter is almost sleep-inducingly boring.  But as a whole, these are minor dents in its mighty armor.
Whether you watch it for the dramatic love, amazing fights or simply as a work of cinema, CTHD is a masterpiece.  Sure, there are better kung-fu movies out there.

I recall when watching ""Henry V"" in a theatre that the projectionist ""fell asleep"" and failed to setup the reels causing the the movie to come to halt right in the middle of the battle of Agincourt. CTHD has transitions just as bad, the worse being after the romantic scene where ShuLien and MuBai are re-connecting; there just isn't enough ""linger"".
The bamboo forest scene also seems rather hurried through, in contrast to Kurosawas reed survival scene in ""Dersu Uzala""; you never get to feel the bamboo.
As far as marial arts and chinese culture, this film might be crisp, but is no less entertaining than, let's say, ""Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin"", a vintage Jackie Chan (acted, not directed) movie.",994723200,,763,4.7443609022556394

The effects in this movie are just mind-boggling.  Chow Yun-Fat gives an excellent performance, not to mention the rest of the cast.  The movie is a bit complex, you'll definitely have to see it more than once to understand everything.
The movie does not revolve around Yun-Fat's character, yet he is a very important character in the story.  As a member of the Hudan, he is one of the greatest warriors in the world.  When he decides that his enigmatic sword, the Green Destiny, has seen enough blood, he charges an old friend with delivering it to a care-taker.  However, when the sword is stolen, and the evidence points to an old enemy whom Yun-Fat had sought for many years, he must return for one final battle.
This is just one sub-plot of the entire movie.  Describing it does no justice...this movie MUST be seen to be appreciated.  A martial arts epic, a love story, a lesson of morality and the deceny of the human spirit...you'll find it all here, brilliantly brought to life through superb acting and amazing special effects.  Some may find the super-human abilities a bit unbeleivable and Matrix-like(considering that the same coordinator from the Matrix was involved, this should come as no surprise), but it simply adds to the unique and flawless perspective of this film.
The movie cannot be fully appreciated if you watch it dubbed...hearing Yun-Fat speak in his native tounge simply adds to the film, not to mention dubbing is not a particularly enjoyable feature.  If you can keep up with the subtitles, which move fast at times, you will enjoy the movie alot more.
Amazing effects, a great story and superb acting make this one of the best films to ever come from Asia.  Well deserving of its Academy Awards, this is yet another epic that cannot be missed!",994636800,,1903,4.719033232628399

A half star for the funny scene (yes there were two) when all the injured fighters complaint to the two protagonist regarding the young lady dragon.  The 2nd funny scene: the ladies were fighting at the end, and the older lady chose a monk's stick and dropped it because it was too heavy for her to swing it.
There were many problems with this movie. Some of which other critics here mentioned. 1. Wires were obviously used in special effects, and 90% of the ""flying"" and ""running"" were not good. I have seen better. 2. Unsettled relationship between the daughter of the murdered policeman and the guard, and the protagonists. 3. Suicide at end needs explanation. The girl just jumped. No explanation.  4. The young dragon was in love with Yun-Fat Chow(protagonist), was that obvious to everyone? 5. Missing conflict between lady dragon and tiger (the old lady who died at the end) 6. The scene at the top of the tree was not good. Yun-Fat Chow is testing the leg strength of young lady dragon. But it looks like he has trouble himself balancing on the tree. Is it leaning against something for support? 7. In the fight scene between the ladies at the end, a thick bar was able to withstand the sword's strength for a while, but finally cut in half like all the other weapons.

This movie also covers everything, love,betrayal,loyalty,duels,rebellion...from majestic Beijing to central China to the scorching desert of Xinjiang. From the Mongolians to the Manchurians , Hans and Uighurs..representative of the few major ethnic groups of China. This movie is a virtual feast, buffet.
Personally, I find that the scene of the desert romance is very important. Remember in a much earlier scene when Zhang Ziyi mentioned to Michelle Yeoh about her ""one true love"" and the appearence of Zhang Zhen later on in her bed room? First we don't know ""who"" her true love is, and second ""where"" did Zhang Zhen(Lo-dark cloud) suddenly appear from? Thus the desert sequence explained the whole thing, and boy, what an exquisite beautiful explaination that was.
One note: These maybe of interest to some, if not all.  The architecture of imperial Beijing is of Mongolian architecture. Chinese rooftop design was infuenced from the Mongolians during Mongol rules of the Yuan Dynasty under the rule of Kublai Khan. Old Hollywood made the mistake of calling pigtail ""Chinese"", The pigtail and the shaved forehead, of the men, is infact very Manchurians. It is during the Qing dynasty ""Manchu empire"" that  the standard pigtail, shaved forehead becomes the rule and must be adopted by all men.  But, the Manchus adopted themselves to speaking Mandarin and writing in Chinese Calligraphy as main form of communication.  Confusing? It is. Dont ask me why. Ask my ancestors.
In the role of the actors. Chow Yuenfatt is ambiguous. We don't know if he is Manchurian or Hans. Zhang Ziyi is Manchurian, from her 1 feet high head gear and her sharp pointed metallic finger covers she wore during her marriage. Michelle Yeoh, policeman Tsai and his daughter are Hans and Zhang Zhen (Dark Cloud) is Uighur.

1135059,4,7883631101,"Don't get me wrong. This was a fun, fun, fun movie. I just don't think that it was Academy Award material. The cinematography was good, I admit, but was really that mind blowing ? When I say cinematography I am talking about cinematography. Many people confuse cinematography with effects and/or the final results of careful digital compositing. Look at some of these sences. Some are pretty washed out and very flat. The interior shots, especially the bar fight, are almost amateur (again, seperate in your mind, the great action sequence from the actual quality of the lighting).
As far as the story goes, I feel that the two stories - the story of the older couple and the story of the younger couple - could have been better integrated with more creative editing. It is as if you see one film for an hour and all of a sudden you are yanked into another for 40 minuites and then returned again. But you know that Ang Lee that wanted to integrate the stories more smoothly or else he would not have tried to include flashes of the caravan scene  earlier on. He tried, but he didn't quite get. Again, don't get me wrong, Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh have great chemistry, but I'm talking here of the flow of the movie.
This film was touted as a great ""woman's lib"" film. I can understand how someone might think so, but Ang Lee is no progressive ! Think about how the movie ends. It shows that a woman can't actually have it all. In fact the story is: when a spoiled young girl rebels, a really cool guy who was trying to help her gets killed. Just because you have heroines jumping around and kicking ..., it does not make it a  ""woman's lib"" film.
I'll say it again. This is a good film. I liked this film. Go see this film. But don't let the hype make you see more in it than there is. There is a Taoist/Star Warsian lesson here: Don't let the masses pull a Jedi mind trick on you !",994377600,3,1888,4.330508474576271

But although it is a very graphic experience that deserves a place in every artistic inclined DvD collection, it's overall impact is unfortunately hindered by extremely poor wire/fight coordination and an unbalanced, overdone storyline. I believe indeed that this film's success is largely based on ther general public's ignorance on asian moviemaking, and encourage everyone interested in the genre to watch titles like Tsu Hyark's The Blade, a flawless and far more believable experience. Tiger and Dragon still deserves a rental for it's exceptional beauty, but hardly the kind of praise it receives.",994204800,,708,5.274336283185841
1135175,5,7883631101,"The movie's title is an old Chinese saying which refers to mysterious and dangerous people (""dragons and tigers"") who are lurking around every corner.  It is also a pun, for two characters in the movie, referred to as ""Jen"" and ""Lo"" in the subtitles, happen to be named ""Lovely Dragon"" and ""Little Tiger"".  The irony is that ""Lovely Dragon"" detests being hidden and ""Little Tiger"" is tired of crouching and waiting; their youthful rebellion is a perfect contrast against the repressed feelings and demeanors of an older couple played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.  There is also a contrast of people who pursue material gains (one character steals a woman's comb, another steals a sword) against others who strive to achieve a higher level of understanding and enlightenment.  These potent themes are what elevate this glorious martial-arts film from other films in this genre.  The imaginative fight sequences are fantastic and exhilarating, but they do not dominate the movie as they often do in movies of this genre.  Kudos to director Ang Lee and co-writer James Schamus.  (The two had never made a martial-arts movie before, and in fact had made 2 box-office bombs prior to CROUCHING TIGER.)
The anamorphic video transfer on the DVD is outstanding -- images are crisp and sharp, colors are vibrant and realistic.  The picture overall looks a bit dark for my liking, but details are never obscured.  This is one of the best-looking DVDs I've ever seen.
The DVD includes optional yellow English subtitles and an English dub track.  Although subtitles are almost always preferrable to dubs, this DVD happens to have one of the best written English dubs I've ever heard.  Lee and Schamus worked on the translations for the dub themselves, and the result is literate and polished.  In one scene, the tersely written subtitle reads, ""Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption.""  But the more lyrical English dub reads, ""We are beset with peril, and it is not weapons.  The real danger resides in the human heart.""  This is not to say that I'm recommending the dub over the subtitles, of course.  The viewer should never be denied the chance to hear an actor's own voice, which is ALWAYS more authentic-sounding than someone else's.
The DVD's audio commentary track is informative and entertaining.  Lee and Schamus speak with great self-deprecation when they criticize many of their own choices -- the ""cliches' in the fight scenes, the ""cheesiness"" of some of the dialogs, the lessons they learned during the shooting.  Early in the commentary Lee explains what ""Giang Hu"" is: ""If filmmaking is a 'world', then Hollywood would be a 'Giang Hu'.""  A ""sub-world"", so to speak.  Lee also jokes about how he ""prayed to the water, which symbolizes money, box office.""  The two also recount various difficulties from the directorial and screenwriting perspectives.
There is also a 20-minute ""making-of"" special that features a few clips of Lee working on the set, sound bites from Lee, Schamus, Yeoh, Chow, composer Tan Dun, and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and a short clip of Coco Lee singing the theme song.  Michelle Yeoh has her own interview segment where she elaborates more on her craft and the movie's themes.

All three main characters have surpassed the kung-fu genre and put Bruce Lee to shame with the help of a few special effects.  While this movie kicks ass, it also survives well WITHOUT the action.

1135316,5,7883631101,"This is a terrific film, combining the once-again-fashionable grandiloquent, epic sweep, stunning choreography (never before have fight sequences so resembled classical dance) and most remarkably, a stiffly extended middle finger to conventional blockbuster wisdom. Martial Arts movies typically obey pretty rigid conventions - they're not especially challenging on the cognitive functions and they're macho, violent and action-obsessed to the exclusion of all else (in particular characterisation and plot).
So in putting together this piece Ang Lee got his box-office smash the hard way: Not only did he film in Mandarin (which might explain to the perceptive reviewer below why they ""couldn't get the lips to sync right""), but he has as the two lead protagonists and fighting extraordinaires, women. And while there's action to do you Tuesday next week, for all the sword play, there's not a great deal of *violence* (the swordfighting is more like ballet than combat), and the voguish brutal realism is replaced by surreal, liquid movement and total disregard for gravity.
Theme-wise, for once there really is something happening - a subtext of struggle against social convention, no small irony given the revolution against cinematic convention which the film represents. There are two love stories, but for the most part they're airily sketched - having said that, the climatic scene, involving one pair of star cross'd lovers, has all the weight of Shakespearian tragedy.
If anything is underdone it's the exposition on the bad guys; It's not clear (in the dubbed version, at any rate) what Jade Fox has done, nor why she's gone over to the dark side, nor why the Diplomat's daughter should be siding with her (other than on account of a wild streak). To my mind Jade Fox could have been left out of the film altogether - it would have required minimal re-writing and perhaps closed off a number of side plots (such as that concerning the police chief) which were not properly developed in the end anyway.
While it's not perfect, it's a landmark film, for if it achieves nothing else it provides an ideal compromise at the video store when *she* wants the English Patient and *he* wants Die Hard II. No mean feat.",993945600,,2220,5.0849315068493155
1135317,4,7883631101,"Since everybody else has already commented on the stunning visuals of CTHD, I have decided to devote my review to commenting on the narrative.
After viewing the extra features on the DVD and watching the interviews, I came to understand that Ang Lee, in making this picture, was responding to the body of work in the wuxia genre. Beyond the obvious martial arts component, the themes dealt with in CTHD are interesting in that they address the dark side of duty, social order, and paternalism; values that form the backbone of eastern philosophy (confucianism), and that are often glorified in martial arts films.
In the typical martial arts picture, women are relegated to submissive roles, and often the plot revolves around defending the honour of one's master, mentor, or father. CTHD departs from these conventions, and places the concerns of the female characters in the spotlight. While it is true that Chow Yun Fat's character, Li Mu Bai, seeks to avenge his master's death, this plot element is downplayed, and in the course of the film we learn that his master was a flawed man who adhered to paternalistic/chauvinistic values (to the point of bringing about his own downfall). Instead, the central concern of the film deals with the subjugation of women; Jen must marry according to her father's and society's expectations, Shui Len is not free to act on her love for Li Mu Bai, Jade Fox is to some extent the product of her oppression. Ang Lee succeeds in painting sympathetic portraits of these characters, and credit must go to the cast for their solid performances, as well as to Ang Lee for his masterful direction.
CTHD is a film with depth and substance and is a true rarity: I can't remember the last time that I saw an action flick that provoked any cerebral activity.

After having purchased the DVD and having watched this wondrous movie several times, I've come to the conclusion that this movie is a true EPIC, in the purest sense of the word.  This is a tale of parallel love stories.  Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's love is tragically romantic.  Eastern cultural laws force their passion to remain unfulfilled.  This subplot really did break my heart.  Just when it appeared they may ignore tradition, tragedy strikes in the third act of the movie.  The Young couple's love is heft with potential yet unfulfilled due to one's greater love to fulfill her destiny as the ""Hidden Dragon"".  A mix of confuscius, Aesop and ""Love Story"" told through Ang Lee's remarkable cinematography and near flaw-less fight sequence direction.
Oh and lest I forget...the action sequences are amazing.  The two female leads have the most incredible swort fight shot in a ""MORTAL KOMBAT"" videogame camera-angle.  The fight-sequence execution by the stars are superior to any movie I've seen.
The DVD has the standard features of a premium DVD: featurette on the making of, commentary, and some other tid-bits.  Not as remarkable as THE MATRIX for features, but more than acceptable.

I might even like this film more than the matrix for first impressions, but it's debatable. There was one thing that dragged the version i watched down though, so please take note if you are buying the VHS version. The dubbed version is pretty awful, you can tell that what the characters are saying in mandarin chinese is so much more intelligent and natural than the english that has been superimposed to try and fit into the lip movements. Not that i can understand mandarin chinese, but the subtitled version allows you to appreciate the actors and actresses talents. As usual the english speaking actors stress and tone some of thier lines as if they were in a play or clearly reading it from a script. This clashes rather dissapointingly with the obvious acting talents of yeoh and Chow yun fat, and come to think of it, most of the actors and actresses in the movie. Although it is still possible to appreciate this movie and be astounded by it as a dubbed movie, the subtitled version is so much better. So my advice would be to buy the subtitled version, it's like a different movie altogether.  The movie itself is a masterpeice. It's 5 oscars are well deserved. The cinematography is breathtaking, beautiful landscapes, as well as beautiful people and buildings. Ang Lee has carefully blended a number of things into this film, which is predominantly a film which centres around a couple of romances. The fight scenes are incredible. Lee and Pau have worked together to successfully recreate and illustrate what the old martial arts movies used to try and do for example crazy flying kicks, and well, flying in general. But in this day and age, the technology is available to make these fight scenes believeable. Therefore we get a taste of how the old school movie makers wanted thier movies. Be careful though, because after the movie the natural progression is to turn to your nearest friend and try and Karate chop him, or try and fly across the room!

The movie used a delightfuly straightfoward but unpredictable ""gotcha"" plot, with a background of many fresh, non-cliche, sequences of martial arts expressionism. Going one better, the movie even showed the aftermath of one salloon brawl (a minor point, but interesting for its thoughtfulness).
Between the two relationships in the film, three if you count the unwanted marraige, I have read a few reviews here on Amazon by people who were disappointed that there wasn't enough development. But this film is not about romance, or couples, it is a brilliant expressionist essay on being true to yourself.

This film manages to be so philosophically deep that it subconsciously stirs emotion and feeling within the audience - without ever being corny. Not to mention that this is probably the best film ever that features the geography of China. Shots were absolutely stunning. Music was also beautiful, with one of the best cello performances given by Yo-Yo-Ma, and a smash hit song by Coco Lee - ""A Love Before Time.""
The film consists of various types of relationships - everything from forced-hidden love, children to parents, and disciple to a kung-fu master. Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen, and Zhang Zi-Yi together made the best acting performances seen for years.
Cinematography was impressing. Each shot was meticulously perfected - exactly why ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" took two years for world-famous director, Ang Lee, to shoot. One shot of the rooftops for the film's previews itself took five months. The original version is much better than the dubbed, so take the time to read subtitles - it can't be that hard.

1135418,5,7883631101,"Why a 400th review?  Because I believe this film has a complexity few have noted.  Yes it is a grand spectacle.  While not quite as glorious as Lawrence of Arabia, I did think it could be mentioned in the same paragraph.  Actually it was The Searchers that came to mind as I was walking out of the theater after seeing it the first time.
Yes it is also a rollicking martial arts flick.  ""How do they do it?""  I know -- they use wires and speeded up (ie slowed down) takes.
It is also a touching love story.  The stars of the film express considerable emotion with very modest looks and gestures.  The line at the end of preferring to be a ghost close to his love over a spirit in heaven ranks up there with the best love lines in film.
But most of all I thought this was a film about narcissism.  There is the narcissism of the main character who is so touched with despair that he momentarily forgets his duty.  There is the narcissism of a different kind of duty that prevents him from ""disrespecting"" the memory of his friend -- the deceased fiancee of the woman he loves.  There are the complicated alliances, including one with a man who seems to be in league with a mafia-like underworld.  (And this is a good guy!!)  There is the bitter narcissism of Gray Fox, the proto-feminist warrior who kills our hero out of rage over a supposed seduction at the hands of his master.  By the way, that was one spot that did not make full sense to me.  Would we expect a Wudon master to have a casual affair with one of his students?
The most narcissistic character is Jen, the Governor's daughter.  She is blessed with native talent which she has begun to cultivate.  She has a feisty spirit.  But over and over again she chooses self-indulgence and narcissism over discipline, over love, over doing the right thing.  She destroys the lives of everyone around her before narcissistically taking her own life in the final scene.
It was the waste of talent resulting from narcissism and the wreckage left in its wake that haunted me for a long time after the film ended.  The meditation on love, duty, discipline, and narcissism is what the film finally was about for me.
I agree heartily with those reviewers who felt the film was poorly served by the DVD transfer.  It is not really terrible, but it is sub-par.  A film of this greatness deserves a first class DVD edition.  I hope one will be forthcoming soon.",993600000,11,2407,4.432801822323462

It is beautifully shot and the art direction is wonderful- this does not make up for a boring story and endless tedious martial arts.

I appreciate the choreography of the action scenes but enough is enough-the flying sequences were not properly realised-you  could not see the wires but you knew they were there!

Special fighting effects are cool, but used way, way too much. Ending was a total cop-out.
On the good side, did provide somewhat of a window into the Chinese culture and internal struggle of class and gender. Female lead was awesome. Inventive, romantic story line (crashed near the end).

1135550,5,7883631101,"""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is misunderstood by most, including those who love it and those who hate it. Crouching Tiger lovers believe that this is the quintessential martial arts movie or that it is a profound reflection of Chinese history, culture, and drama. While the fighting scenes in this movie, are thrilling and fun to watch, they are more acrobatic and fantastic than anything else. I think that's what Ang Lee intended, and I'll explain why in a moment. As to the cultural significance of this film, there really isn't one unless you are interested in obscure academic topics such as the sociological significance of Chinese martial arts soap operas.
And there lies the key: this film is essentially a supped up martial arts soap opera. Martial Arts soap operas are wildly popular throughout Asia and on many American TV stations with Asian language programs. I've seen many of them on Chinese TV programs in the US and China, and my wife used to watch them every weekend in the Southeast Asian city where she grew up.
Martial Arts soap operas often feature the same themes as Crouching Tiger, such as avenging the master's death, restoring a treasure to its rightful owner, rescuing a damsel in distress, unrequited love, etc. They also feature many of the same combat scenarios including fighters flying at each other through the air, roof top chases, sword duels, ambushes, miracle healing, and so forth. These films are neither meant to showcase true martial arts performances like some of Jet Li's earlier works, or countless Main Land Chinese Kung Fu movies, nor are they intended to bring Chinese history to life. Instead, they are genre-driven, formulaic, fun, and often absurd.
Does this mean that Crouching Tiger is a bad movie-absolutely not! I think Ang Lee quite deliberately set out to make a high-end, jazzed up martial arts soap opera. The first time I saw this movie in San Francisco, the largely Chinese audience enthusiastically applauded after the first fight scene, as did my wife and I. We had all seen this sort of thing hundreds of times before but never on such a magnificent scale with so much realism, grandeur, and suspense. Ang Lee pushed the martial arts soap opera genre to the limit, and he did so superbly.
As the months went by I usually heard one of two responses to this film. The majority of people liked it but often claimed that it was deep, profound and revealing to them-that it taught them something about Chinese culture. The film's detractors on the other hand found the fight scenes unbelievable and the plot too melodramatic. I think both sets of people failed to realize that all they were watching was a really well done martial arts soap opera.",993427200,,2709,4.853131749460043

1135552,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is an incredible tale of two interwoven stories of love. Not only that, the movie features phenomenal cinematography in some the best fight sequences ever filmed. It's hard not to love CTHD, with it's beautiful scenery and epic tale. The film centers mainly around Zhang Ziyi, who plays a beautiful girl being forced into marriage to benefit her family's social status while secretly harboring deep feelings for an outlaw. She's also fascinated by Michelle Yeoh's character, a seasoned warrior visiting her home. Michelle Yeoh also has hides a secret love, Li Mu Bai (played by Chow Yun Fat), whom she cannot marry for fear of dishonoring his late husband. Zhang's quest for satisfaction will bring them all together, but at their risk of their own lives.
But enough with the plot. CTHD features some of the best (if not THE best) fights ever seen. As the characters effortlessly bound across the screen on rooftops and treetops to escape their enemy or fight passionately in face-to-face. The movie is of the ""martial arts fantasy"" genre, meaning that characters defy the laws of gravity and physics with ease. This accentuates their story, but never overtakes it. These epic battles are an expression of their strong emotions and the burden they feel for peace. The fights include one actor against an entire bar, a chase through the rooftops followed by some insane hand-to-hand combat, and one fight involving so many weapons that you'll watch it over and over again.
If you don't like subtitles the DVD offers an option for dubbed playback, but I enjoy it better reading the text.

1135554,5,7883631101,"Most often, picking one single film as a favorite is difficult. There are so many good ones, how can we pick only one? After seeing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (on DVD) for the second time, I believe this could be the best film I've ever seen for these reasons:
The fight scenes
 To say these are the best martial arts sequences ever filmed makes it sound like there are other films that are close. I believe that these fight scenes are far and above the best ever. Adding to the action is the fact that the women are as good, if not better, than the men. So many films place women in subordinate roles. Not this one.
The music
 During the first fight scene, the polyrhythmic drumming made me realize how sick I am of conventional action music. Many action films now only use rock and techno to drive the scenes. But CTHD used more subtle, dark music to color the scenes. Yo Yo Ma's cello work was also outstanding.
The poetic tragedy
 CTHD's mythical qualities and tragic themes are very well done. Similar to opera and Greek Mythology, the film shows painful lessons without being preachy or melodramatic.
The cinematography and scenery
 I noticed something unusual watching CTHD the second time. Often during the outdoor shots, Ang Lee placed his camera farther away from the actors than normal. This did two things: it painted great cinematic pictures and it was respectful of the beautiful landscapes.
The love stories
 So many film love stories seem unreal to me. The love stories in CTHD were both unique and very real for different reasons. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh's love story was particularly well done. Their long unrequited love was painful and real.",993427200,,1672,4.712328767123288

This movie is AMAZING the landscapes are beautiful and the fight scenes are just down right the BEST choreagraphed I have ever seen on screen. I like how the main characters come across as these spiritual yet very smart and respected people who respect the power that the sword gives it's user. The cast MICHELLE YEOH and YUN-FAT CHOW give this movie a quality that no martial arts movie has ever had, TRULY GREAT ACTING! I loved the way the characters would seem to amaze me as they jumped and glided through the air. The movie is based upon this amazing sword that is stolen by someone in the village. After Michelle Yeoh's character almost catches the culprit, the theif soon gets away with the sword and gives the them a run for there money when fighting in battle as she was taught a gifted form of martial arts by one of the greats in China.

The universal, enthusiastic praise this one received left me expecting a great film... instead this is a very good film.  The first few ""flying"" scenes showed remarkable special effects.  After the 20th time they flew, I felt it really took away from the martial arts technique.  Personally, I'll take Enter the Dragon as the best martial arts film ever made.  As a drama, the movie is good, but the story does begin to drag in a few places.  Clearly, this is a well made, entertaining film... but a candidate for best movie of the year at the academy awards?  Traffic and Gladiator are clearly much better.  If everyone hadn't claimed this to be a great film  ( a landmark in martial arts films), I would be more willing to sing its praises.

It just goes to show how poorly the academy awards are at choosing movies.  There must have been some Bejing connection there, kind of like giving Bill Clinton an award for honesty and integrity. No story line, if there was it was so poor it was barely noticable.  Impossible to believe flying fighters? Reality is what separates movies from cartoons.  I suppose the flying was the biggest giveaway, people just don't do that and even if these people had wings on them it wouldn't have made it any more believeable.  Overall, an insult to the intelligence.  Of course in China it doesn't take much to entertain.  They watch American movies even though they don't understand anything about them.  Can you imagine the Chinese trying to understand one of the inner city black movies they make today?  I'll watch it again just to make sure my assessment is correct though, but throughout the movie I kept waiting for the story line to unfold.  It never did.",993340800,5,1126,4.54726368159204

It has special effects which aren't just amazing to excite the audience but very beautiful to look at. It has a good script and story line. It has a somewhat spiritual connection.

1135663,5,7883631101,"Sacrilegous?  Maybe, but true all the same.  Star Wars takes 3 movies to have as many scenes of incredibly duelling action and intense emotion.  That's not to belittle the story or the movies, but it is stretched out.  If, like me, you consider the Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker storyline to be the key to those films, you realize how well the story is developed but also how slowly.  Well this film VERY quickly, and with great subtlety builds up the same sort of drama and presents some of the most mystical and wonderful scenes in just 2 hours.  Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are fantastic and hopefully cement their ability to be in major Hollywood releases.  Meanwhile Zhang Ziyi makes a stunning appearance as well.  It's been a long time since such a film came out and captured so many imaginations.  I think while many films will not stand the test of time, this is right up there with the Star Wars trilogy, Vertigo, and true classics.  I'm glad to say I was around when this came out.

When you watch this movie, you will notice some weird stuff when the fighting scenes go on. People will start flying like Peter Pan from building to building. If you look at the making of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (it's on the ""Special Features"" menu), they weren't using computers to make them look like they're flying...they were actually using a group of people to pull on the string so it can look like they're flying (sometimes they use a truck). I don't really find the flying scenes stupid. People say that they look stupid when they fly, but to be honest, It was actually pretty cool. At least they do more fighting than flying. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon focuses more on fighting and drama, and thats a good thing, considering that Chinese movies have good drama in the first place. Now let me change the subject ! When I heard that Chow Yun-Fat was going to be one of the main characters in the movie, I was so desperate to see him in action again, including Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. When I saw them in action, I was very amazed with their fighting routines, including the part when Chow Yun-Fat practices with the Green Destiny sword.

It sparks a lot of interest for reasons that I don't understand; aside from the fact that it has green trim on the blade, it is just another one of the hundreds of weapons used in this disgrace of a movie.
The opening of this sorry excuse for a motion picture didn't lead me to believe that it would end up being as bad as it was.

Eventually, the woman meets a stranger and goes between getting acquinted with him and trying to kill him.

Li Mu Bai is a ""renowned swordsman"", famous as the best kung fu master.  He has had enough of Giang Hu and looks to spending the rest of his days in peace with Shu Lien, his long-time lover.  So Mu Bai turns his sword, the Green Destiny, over Shu Lien, telling her to give it to Sir Te.  But the sword is quickly stolen and as Shu Lien investigates this, she comes to suspect Jen Yu, the young aristocrat she has just befriended.  Jen is a willful girl, somewhat spoiled, but frivolous.  She longs for the adventure of Giang Hu and despises the thought of an arranged marriage.  What she hides is a romance in the desert and her great competence in fighting.  Jen's nanny, the villainous Jade Fox, is her secret kung fu teacher, whom Jen has long surpassed.

I pop in my brand spanking new Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon DVD and go straight for the goodie section (since I have seen the movie twice in the theater already, I was curious to see what extras the fine folks at Sony were going to stuff on my disk).
I decide to view the ""Bravo"" making-of featurette first...I am a total sucker for making-of films.
And BOOOOOM..the music hits you like a ton of bricks...BOMP BOMP BOMP or something like that.  Then cut to director Ang Lee sitting in his director's chair...moving his lips...
Eh?  I cant HEAR him!  I scroll back a few frames...BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP....and lips moving...so then I grab my remote and pump up the volume REALLY high...and then I hear it...this faint faint voice...gee whiz,,,is that ANG?
When I got into the grape factory this morning, I log onto Amazon and see that I was not the only one who thought the sound truly SUCKED on this disk...and this whole time I thought I was turning into a raisin.
I cannot express to you how disappointed I was at this DVD. I really loved Tan Dun's score, but MY LORD...I wanted to hear some of the dialogue too!  And the poor sound quality was all over the disk too...
The images were crisp and pretty..the night fight scene, which was difficult to see in the theatre, was brightened the teeniest bit so that you can see the surfaces and the houses more clearly...
But there is no excuse for that GODAWFUL SOUND!  I personally prefer subtitles, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear the inflections in the actors voices...oh wait..I could barely hear those at all because of the GODAWFUL SOUND!
Grapes make very little money, therefore it was a pain to me to know that I wasted my hard earned dollars on a disk that is so low in quality.

i'm not saying this was a horrible movie, but i certainly don't see what was so remarkable about it.  it was a kung-fu film with a slightly higher budget than normal, i think the fact that it was the first of its kind to be imported specifically for the american (and international) audience somehow made the critics feel obligated to laud it as some great masterpiece, some crowning achievement for chinese cinema.

1135871,5,7883631101,"First time I saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was in the movie theaters. I had very high expectations for the movie. I didn't mind the Chinese (Mandarin) dialog, since I am Chinese, and it's always better than the poor English dubbed movies. It was a beautiful film with lots of stunning sceneries of China. It gives the movie a sense of mysticism that kung fu period films of recent years usually have, which is a must. When the first fight scene came on, with Jen (Zhang Zi-Yi) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), I thought it was going to be one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen... it wasn't the best, but it was very good. There were loads of awesome moments, with the cool spinning kicks, jumping around the buildings, and other such action, but some of the flying around I thought looked a tad unrealistic. There was one particular part where Shu Lien collided with Jen when they where running on the wall, I thought they could of made that scene a little better. But I had to hand it to Yeoh and Zhang, it was a hard scene to shoot. All the other fight scenes were better in exception to the first fight with Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei). I do not know if Cheng studies kung fu, but in the movie, with all due respect, she didn't look too convincing. Li Mu-Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) was good, knowing this is his first kung fu movie ever. Chow's acting was strong, but I think Jet Li would of been a better Li Mu-Bai because of what Jet Li is capable of doing physically. I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I've heard that Jet Li was suppose to play Li Mu-Bai, but turned it down because of his promise to his wife Nina. Anyway, the dramatic elements was a good touch for the movie and new to this genre. Overall the movie was very well made and a delight to watch. It was a good movie, which gets better after more viewings, but it does not live up to the hype that most American audiences give it. Mainly because as a Chinese movie viewer, I've seen it done before, as far as the action scenes, and I don't really see anything new. I still liked the fight choreography done by the master of fight choreographies, Yuen Woo-Ping. I am glad that this movie got the exposure that it did in America, hopefully the American audience can see more of the beauty of Chinese culture in future Chinese movies theatrically released in the US. If you want to see other great period kung fu films in recent years, check out these titles: ""Tai Chi Master"" (aka ""Twin Warriors""), ""Swordsman II"", ""Wing Chun"", ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series, ""Drunken Master II"" (aka ""The Legend Of Drunken Master""), ""The Last Hero Of China"" (aka ""Deadly China Hero""), ""New Legend Of Shaolin"", & ""Fong Sai Yuk"" series (aka ""The Legend"" series).

I got used to them as did most people within twenty minutes, and they added an authenticity feel to the movie.  Without the sub-titles the movie would probably have been a Jackie Chan styled movie. The story of this movie is based around a young girl named Jen.  She is un-happy with her life.  She is forced to marry a man she does not love, and she runs away.  There are many sub-plots to this movie but that is the main story. This movie did an incredible job mixing Asian myth with real people.  The fighting sequences are well done and fun to watch.

1135873,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is director Ang Lee's tribute to the Kung Fu movies of the 60's and 70's.  While those movies were high on action, low on plotlines, Mr. Lee combines both into a visually stunning, intricately woven, action packed film.  The story takes place in the 19th century and revolves around a sword called ""The Green Destiny"".  Chow Yun-Fat plays Li Mu Bai, the greatest of all warriors who was in possession of the sword and then gives it to a friend as he has found enlightenment and no longer wishes to fight.  The sword is delivered by his longtime friend Yu Shu Lien played by Michelle Yeoh.  While at their friend's house, the sword is stolen by mysterious figure who turns out to be the innocent looking aristocratic daughter of a governor, Jen played by the exquisite Zhang Ziyi.  In the first fight scene, a disguised Jen and Yu Shu Lien fly across rooftops and engage in battle.  This scene is among the most breathtaking and beautifully choreographed fight scenes in movie history.  In fact the scene is more ballet than kung fu. Li Mo Bai is forced to return to battle for The Green Destiny.  In a fight scene with Jen, he realizes she is no ordinary warrior, but one with special abilities.  He wants her to become his student, but she refuses.  Another fight scene that takes place on the tops of bamboo trees is equal to the roof top scene.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the best combination of action and drama to be released in a long time and the fighting scenes are not there for gratuity, but serve a purpose.  Mr. Lee did a brilliant job with this film and hopefully he will try to make another in this genre.",992822400,4,1658,4.523489932885906

1135878,5,7883631101,"The Far East storytellers finally meet the Far West in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It is one of the most refreshing films I've seen in a long time.  At last, Eastern Culture reveals their swashbuckling romantic side, in a film that portrays the plausible impossible.  It's comforting to know that, worldwide, we share the same dream.
It's a tale of love, with the thread taking a trail similar to King Arthur's Knights in Shining Armor.  It has its evil villain, oriental style, and the Impossibly Beautiful Princess, who is miserably betrothed to some old-coot throne dweller, whom she doesn't love.  Now comes the hero, whom she truly does love.  He, of course, a handsome but poor peasant, culturally doomed --- forbidden to even think of marrying her.
  Swords are destined to clash in a plot like this --- and clash they do --- but with one huge difference: the swordspeople are not your men in shining armor: they are women!  This is truly cool.  When men clang swords, I see grimness in their eyes.  When the women of this film clang swords, I see fire in their eyes.  Nice touch.
The direction, cast and filmography are great.  The very talented actor, Chow Yun Fat, will be a familiar face to most viewers and thank goodness, we need him.  He provides a steadying influence when we come upon the Impossibly Beautiful Princess, Zhan Zi Yi, a dazzling young actress, wielding her heart-stealing repertoire of skills.
  This film is a gigantic leap from the sad grayness that's been so often depicted in earlier works from the Far East.  Try this film; if you're a hopeless romantic like me, you'll love it.

If you want to see a real martial arts flick, buy a Jet Li film or go with the ""Classics"", like Enter the Dragon, but I doubt people who rave about Crouching Tiger will ever see one of those films.

The cinematography: Yeah, its well filmed, but so what? That's not enough of a reason for a 5 star review, there is alot of nice looking garbage on DVD.
So why all the hoopla? Beat's me, maybe it has something to do with women movie goers getting all worked up over the ""strong female"" characters in the film (again, nothing new to this genre, the ""Heroic Trio"" is one example). And a PG-13 Rating? That was a pure marketing decision.

Maybe if they weren't running up vertical walls and on the ceiling or across the landscape with their feet moving it would have been a little more believable. I mean why move your feet when they aren't contacting anything half the time. Why not just wing it like Superman did. His flight scenes were much more realistic than this amateurish attempt.

MY REVIEW:
""The fighting sequences deserve a lot of credit, since the kung fu team who taught Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss in THE MATRIX also taught Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi in this film.  The action is great, the romance just elongates the film even more than it needs to be.  But how did this movie earn an Academy Award nomination for BEST PICTURE?!  This is no BEST PICTURE of 2000 even when you watch the movie in English.  But definetely check this movie out!""- MJV & the Movies.",992563200,,871,4.703947368421052

I find it odd that no critic seems to have noticed the Star Wars parallels (Or maybe it is more appropriate to say that this movie continues the tradition that inspired Star Wars) which include 3 distinct climatic regions, several cantinas filled with a variety of exotic people, and a mystical warrior with special powers.  But apart from the stunning visuals this movie offers an increadible philosophical position.  Much like the recently released novel ""Glorious Failure"" by Ben Jonjak, ""Crouching Tiger"" espouses a theory of self-actualization that sounds so perfect that it must be true.

1136005,5,7883631101,"So much has been said about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" already that it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess the ultimate appeal of this movie comes from the fact that it has a little bit of everything, and does it all well.  It is by turns an action/thriller, political suspense, romance and comedy.  And that's aside from the astonishing cinematography and score; if this isn't the most brilliantly filmed/edited movie ever, I don't know what is.  Even the fact that the film is subtitled in no way detracts from its impact.  The dialogue is spare, which makes it easy to keep up, and the Mandarin has an almost lyrical quality that is incredible to listen to.
Furthermore, the special effects are simply mind-blowing.  To find sequences that are even better than ""The Matrix"" and that are at the same time artistic, almost poetic is just incredible.  One could easily watch this movie with the sub-titles turned off and still appreciate it.
The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extra features.  There is a documentary on the making of the film, but it's short and not particularly impressive.  There is also an option to view the movie in dubbed English (5.1 or two channel), but it would really be a crime to do so.  In the end, the lack of features in no way detracts from the quality of the disc.

I found Michelle Yeoh in particular to be marvelous; her performance is the one that really ties the whole film together.  Chow Yun-Fat was very good, as were the entire cast.  As with any good foreign film, after a time the viewer gets caught up in the plot, and language really becomes a minor issue.  Good acting is good acting-period.
Some of the other reviewers seem locked into the Western film tradition, and expect all movies to fit within preconceived formulaic categories.  While influences from the West are certainly evident in ""Tiger"", it is not rife with cliches, as so many recent films are.
I for one have a generally negative view of modern cinema; perhaps one film in twenty really hits me in a positive way.

The fighting skills she displays are simply amazing for such a young gal, I'm sure we'll see much of her in the future (just probably not in Hollywood). One of the reasons I felt Crouching Tiger was so wonderful was the beautiful Mandarin dialect that these actors spoke in.  Most of them had to learn this dialect (including Yun-Fat) so it was very hard to fight and speak a new language at the same time, but the language has this beautiful sound that is unlike no other.

Fortunately for our friends in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they were able to win at least a couple of awards they deserved.  Unfortunately, I felt that the movie offered little more than beautiful scenery, asthetics, and direction.  Obviously the action scenes scattered throughout the movie are astounding and deserve a permanent place in the history of entertainment, but I found nothing unique about the plot of the movie, and not much beyond the rather simple rythym of the soundtrack.  That aside, I must say that the movie is amazing and earns its right to have been in contention for Best Picture at the Oscars.  The position of the camera throughout the movie offers an awe-inspiring view of this almost whimsical world of martial arts that director Ang Lee has invisioned for the tale.  The vibrant colors of the cities and wildernesses (even deserts) display that they did not cheapen themselves or the audience with art direction.  By all means this is a fantastic movie to purchase, I have not found as much in it as most probably have (I'm not a real action fan), but I can easily suggest that anyone who purchases the DVD is in for a treat.",992217600,2,1441,4.786290322580645

But what about the DVD? Well sadly it is the most dismal piece of work to come from Sony DVD center this year. Sony was on a streak of superb discs recently but this hack job put an end to that.
The DVD was clearly rushed to market. The transfer is not very clean at all. The MPEG2 artifacts are terrible. Those of us who are fortunate to have a widescreen TV are going to be the most unfortunate this time. The Native widescreen presentation is oh so dismal of an experience! The colors are clean but the pixel jaggies does enough damage to distract the viewer.
The Audio tracks are not at all well managed. There is no reason what so ever to waste valuable data bandwidth to do a Dolby pro-logic track. I love the fact that the disc comes with both Mandarin & English 5.1 Dolby Digital but the bass is so weak. The audio was not at all enhanced. The commentary track is nothing new, it's above average.
The Extras are well... lacking, the making of documentary is pure PR fluff sadly, and the trailers are not even the original ones that Sony was using to advertise the film. The photomontage is mediocre at best.
So why all these complaints? Sony has a masterpiece on their hands and it's pretty clear they did not give it the proper treatment. In a market place where we will have ""Patch Adams: Ultimate Edition"", and Bring it on: Super Special Extra Spectacular Widescreen Edition, one would assume the big guys at Sony will release a DVD of monumental standards of their big film of 2000. But NO!
So what they miss? First of all the Video was mediocre and should be redone. The Audio needs a lot of work; they should be enhanced to take advantage of all the speakers. A DTS track is perfect for this film I would say. How about a Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat & Ang Lee commentary track? Most of all a Score Only track would be prudent since the film won best score at the academy awards. I am sure there are deleted scenes they could have put on the disc. How about some real making of docs, discussing the stunt work, the novels, or even the production in a larger scale. There are a wealth of pictures on this film, why not include them in user control slide shows? What happened to the music videos?
Sony rushed this disc to the market to capitalize on the films fame. The product is average at best. This film deserves a superior DVD job. Come on Sony, stop giving us special editions of Center Stage and give us a true Collector's Special Edition of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon!

1136095,5,7883631101,"Let me begin by expressing my utter amazement at the artwork in this film.  From the beautiful sets and incredible special effects to the consummate acting, brilliant direction and wonderful storyline, I must say that movies of this caliber are very rare.  It succeeds on all levels: it is action-packed yet well-paced, dramatic and humorous; it is both a love story and an epic adventure.  Admitting that my knowledge of the Wuxia genre is somewhat limited, I would still venture to say that the fight scenes in this film are some of the best (at least that I have seen) committed to celluloid. The fight scenes come across as both poetic and energizing, like a ballet with sharp and dangerous weapons.  If you are looking for a slapstick Jackie Chan-esque martial arts fun-fest in the vein of Drunken Master, this IS NOT your movie. It does have its fun moments but the humor is much more sublime, with a dazzling wit that never seems out of context.  All this being said, I would like to focus on the DVD itself, that is its features.  The audio is superb, with both the English dub AND original Mandarin presented in a well-mixed 5.1.  The dialogue is well-integrated with the action and score, with little need to constantly adjust the volume.  The picture is pristine and quite frankly, among the cleanest I have ever seen on DVD.  There is some interesting commentary and an informative making-of featurette, but the thing that most impressed me was the English dub. I noticed one reviewer here who indicated interest in this DVD because it contained an English dub that might be funny to watch like other martial arts films.  Well, I'm sorry to say that said reviewer will be sorely disappointed if he's looking for laughs in that department.  Unlike many films of the genre the dub is almost flawless.  The fluidity of the English language allowed the producers of this DVD to manipulate sentence structure so that the English dialogue synchs perfectly with the actors' lips, yet still stays true to its content.  Of course, I would always recommend the original Mandarin with English subtitles, but for those of you who despise subtitles (shame on you!) will still be able to enjoy this movie with minimum distraction from the dubbing.  Altogether, I found the DVD release to be a wonderful complement to this beautiful film.  If you have not done so already, buy this one.  You will not regret it.",992217600,13,2408,4.766265060240964

But the movie is so great, with the special effects and fight scenes, you can turn the subtitles and voices off and watch the movie over and over again with enjoyment!!  For those of you that love martial arts and the old martial arts films, this DVD is a MUST HAVE!!",992217600,,824,4.25
1136097,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon along with The Matrix are the two best movies of the last 5 years.  Both have amazing depth in terms of dialogue, humanity, and important human experiences and desires and both have some of the most spectacular fighting sequences and technology used.  I keep seeing so many claims that Crouching Tiger is not a martial arts film and that it is a drama.  Well, I don't know about those people...but the martial arts were very very integral to this story in my book.  I do go to scenes 20 and 21 just to watch them, after all!  After the years invested in watching men fight, it was nice to see a few women involved.  I very much enjoyed the few lines sprinkled in by the bad guy (girl), Jade Fox about how she couldn't get training...and the line about ""Poison...poison is an 8 yr old girl full of deceit""...even though we can't relate with these characters fully, we get to peek into their life experiences...and all the acting was just amazing.  I like how even when some characters are briefly on the screen, they are not cardboard papercut people.  The fighting scenes are right up there with Fist of Legend and Supercop.  For those who loved the fighting...The Matrix has nothing on the two aforementioned films.  Go see them all!",992131200,,1265,4.607142857142857

They should have done a version in English.  Most of the battle sequences were lame, just people throwing darts at each other or chasing each other around on roof tops. With all the great publicity the movie got I expected it to be better.  Even though I was disapointed, the movie is worth seeing if you don't mind subtitles.  The thing I did like was the acting, Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh did a great job. I also like the ending, it wasn't what I expected to happen.",992131200,2,621,4.228813559322034
1136187,5,7883631101,"""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is a film unlike any foreign film I have ever seen. Before seeing it or reading any of the reviews, one could assume that it would be a typical kung fu movie with the poorly done voice overs and the bad story. It is not even in the least. This DVD features the original theatrical subtitle version as well as an extremely well done voice over version. The story is hands down one of the best of this year. It contains two love stories, martial arts choreographed from Yuen Wo Ping (For those of you who have seen ""The Matrix"" you know what I'm talking about), beautiful acting, and some of the best scenery that I have seen since the deserts in ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Two great warriors (Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh) begin their new challenge when the 400 year old sword ""the Green Destiny"" is stolen. Zhang Ziyi plays an aristocrat who has a far away love and a strong temper. The film appears like it has extremely expensive special effects but the total cost of the film was 15 mil.  Now lets get to the DVD extras. This DVD features more extras than some of the ""Special Edition"" DVDs that only have a trailer and production notes. The film features commentary from director Ang Lee(The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility) and writer James Schamus, a Bravo making of special, a conversation with Michelle Yeoh, and the U.S. and International trailer(There are more but these are the best). Finally, some DVDs are exiting to get at first but after a few weeks get old. Let me tell you, this is not one of them.

I walked into the theater, unsure what I was about to see. As I sat, mezmorized by the beautiful cinematography, I realized that the story had not yet started. The colors were vivid and the story expressive. I suggest watching it in the original subtitle form, you forget that you are reading them after awhile, and you get the whole experience. As the story progressed I looked around  theater...usually there is always one group of people talking and being obnoxious, not this time. Everyone sat watching with deep intensity.
The DVD is of good quality, as it was in the theaters. A chinese fairy tale of of wonderful quality. WARNING: This movie is like an hour and a half or two hour long dream sequence.

I popped it in and was goaded into watching the English Dubbed version.  I must say, I was greatly disappointed.  Just the way certain people talked in English really gave it the wrong impression.  Some fight scenes, particularly the first fight against Jade Fox came off somewhat comedic.  By the end I was shaking my head.  I felt that Jen (Zhang Ziyi) was just a spoiled brat who wanted to do everything her way, with no respect for others.  But right after the film ended and everyone else had left, I watched the film again, this time in Mandarin, with English Subtitles.  I was blown away, to say the least.  It was like a whole new different experience.  Sequences made more sense and this time Jen did not come across as a spoiled brat but more of a lost soul, torn inside and yet full of life and wanting to take on the whole world.  But the scenes I enjoyed the most were the ones between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  When he talks about always wanting to touch her but never having the courage to, it really put things in perspective.  Even great warriors are not always that smart when dealing with matters of the heart.  Truly a masterpiece, and yes the fight scenes are amazing.  I know the idea of sitting down and reading subtitles through an entire movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, but to truly appreciate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon it must be done, otherwise you may never truly understand its meaning, and that would be a great loss all its own.",992131200,6,1681,4.409090909090909

I went to see Crouching Tiger thinking it was going to be one of those dreary martial arts films. At the end, along with the rest of the audience, I was applauding madly. This is an exquisite film, requiring little effort to suspend disbelief. Its fight choreography (accompanied by perfectly appropriate drumming) is breathtaking, as are the cinematography and the special effects. The cast is wonderful, acting their parts with restraint appropriate to the setting; Yun-Fat Chow has a peerless onscreen presence.
My only quibble is with the end-title music, which is modern and a little silly and makes one wonder why-after a score performed by top-tier artists (YoYo Ma, for one)-this (astonishingly) academy-award nominating song (which didn't win, mercifully) was tacked on to a thoroughly authentic period piece which is otherwise all but flawless.

1136196,4,7883631101,"If you saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon you must own the DVD. The movie will prove timeless in it's entertainment value. My rating of four stars is strictly for the movie itself. The quality of the DVD was very disappointing. First of all, except for the soundtrack, the sound in the Mandarin version (5.1 Digital)has been transferred to the DVD at a very low volume. I checked all the settings on my receiver and DVD player and all were set correctly. However, while the soundtrack booms through my speakers, voices and ambient sounds are hard to hear. Therefore, I had to increase the volume to hear voices, but turn it down when the music chimes in. As in the theatrical release, the cinematography is outstanding. The colors are vibrant and sharp.
Most disappointing was the Commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus. They add nothing to the enjoyment of the film. You learn nothing of interest. The commentary by James Schamus was especially annoying, and at times offensive. Offensive to both the viewer and to Ang Lee. All Ang Lee can do is chuckle at Mr. Schamus' bad jokes.
In contrast, the 15 minute interview wiith Michelle Yeoh was informative and intelligent. What a bonus it would have been if the DVD was released with commentary by Ang Lee, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yung Fat. Maybe then we could have learned more about the making of this film.",992044800,9,1358,4.7100840336134455

1136277,5,7883631101,"Let me start out by saying that this is one of the most enchanting, enrossing, and mesmerizing films I have ever seen.  There are many levels to it, and you can honestly say you discover something new about it every time you see it.  This DVD version is wonderful, though perhaps nothing can compare to seeing it on the big screen.  The conversation with Michelle Yeoh is enlightining, and as for the making of documentry, well, it's always nice to see a bit of what went on behind the scenes.
Also, I must say that, in my opinion, while the Mandarin sounds better to the ear and adds to the overall feeling of the film, I feel the English dubbing is more rich and fluid in its translation than that of the English subtitles.  If you watch the English dubbing and the English subtitles at the same time, it is shocking how different they are.  My suggestion is to give both a try at least once, and decide which you like better.
One last note: while it has been advertised that the music videos for A Love Before Time would be contained on the DVD, they are, in fact, not there.  Though if you look on the back of the DVD case where it lists the special features, the music videos are not listed.

1136282,4,7883631101,"I really hate it when people hype movies up for me. I'm not talking about public hype, or critics reviews or things of that sort; what I'm referring to is the people that tell you that a certain movie is the best movie ever made, and then divulge into the elements of it, drawing you into a conversation about everything that the movie is and what it stands for, and everything that they felt watching the movie, so that after they finally shut up, all you can think about is going to see that movie.
This, believe it or not, happened to be the case with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" a movie that everyone and his brother kept telling me about. Now, before everyone starts hounding me for not liking this movie, let me clarify to all of you that I did like it. I found it to be a very good movie, one of the better martial arts films ever. Instead of providing a lame story for the purpose of using the martial arts formula, the backbone is one of passion, adventure, all of which has an overall fantasy-like appearance that draws us in and keeps us in its clutches. But I did expect a little more out of it.
Set in 19th century China, the movie begins with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), a well-known warrior, giving his legendary sword, known as the Green Destiny, to his longtime friend, Sir Te. Just as quickly as it arrives, it is stolen from Sir Te, and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who delivered the gift, suspects that the new arrivals residing in Governor Yu's home are responsible. Mu Bai has his own suspicions, which are confirmed when he realizes that the thief is Jade Fox, the powerful female warrior responsible for the death of his master long ago.
With her, Fox carries a disciple, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who possesses great fighting capabilities. The movie ventures into a long continuous memory through her eyes, recalling her past love affair with a bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), who returns to rekindle their love. Meanwhile, as the battle for the sword and justice swells, Shu Lien and Mu Bai also recognize their mutual feelings for one another, all mounting to a very emotionally powerful climax where the unexpected suddenly becomes a reality.
The movie certainly does prove a point that American-made martial arts films pale sorely in comparison to the grandeur of the stunts and action sequences performed here. Choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, best known for his work on the stunts in ""The Matrix,"" brings a highly-stylized visual flare to the stunts performed by the actors themselves in this film. While the action and fight sequences are meant to be stunning, they are never totally suspenseful, however, nor do they need to be.
This is not a film that's all about swordplay and running across rooftops, even if most people will remember it for such scenes. It's also about the intense passion between the characters and the love they share for one another. Lo and Jen's encounter and budding romance is better than anything I've ever seen in a movie in a very long time; Lo's one line, ""I am a man, and I've found the brightest star of all,"" sells us on their romance and it's believability. While the romance between Shu Lien and Mu Bai takes a backseat to the heated passion of the aforementioned couple, it is still no less captivating once the final third of the movie plays out.
The setting itself is worth the price of admission. China, or nature for that matter, never looked so beautiful and exquisite. The night skies cast blue hues on everything they touch, adding to that dreamy look and feel that the movie gives off. Scenic shots and panoramic views add to the beauty and texture of the setting, while also giving off that fantastical feeling.
The movie also portrays a very dignified Chinese society. Their use of common etiquette, even in some fight scenes, is quite intriguing, while their calmness and sense of peace is also portrayed through the characters. Actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi portray their characters with all of these emotions and traits, exuding a peaceful demeanor even in some of the more physically charged scenes. And director Ang Lee made an excellent choice of keeping the movie from ever getting too fast-paced or over-the-top; he knows his pacing, and it's right on the money.
So what is it about this movie I didn't like? Nothing, really. Everything about it is epic in nature, the performances are stellar, the martial arts impressive and well-done, the setting lush and breathtaking, and the overall effect tear-jerking at certain moments. What ruined this film experience for me was not the movie itself, but people making it out to be something more than it is, which is no fault of the filmmakers at all. Still, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an impressive and beautiful achievement.",991958400,7,4786,4.712410501193317

One of my favorite scenes would have to be the restaurant fight where all those ""big"" men get their tails whipped by this young princess with supernatural abilities.  With all the heroes flying and all, this made the movie seem like a kung-fu version of Peter Pan, and you all know how cool Peter Pan is.  I have been waiting for an English-dubbed version just so I can watch this movie like those cheesy old-school kung-fu films.

However, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this didn't feel foreign.  Exotic, perhaps, but influenced by Americans.  Ang Lee is a great Oriental director, but he is ironically better off portraying 70's American suburbia (in The Ice Storm, his masterpiece) and English Austen territory in Sense and Sensibility.  I didn't feel that his direction of CTHD was nearly as tight as it was in his other films.  There were scenes that seemed excessive, significantly dragging down the pace of the entire film.
All that said, this film is exciting and radiant.  I've never seen better performances from the leads, and the much-discussed action sequences are just as breathtaking as you've heard they are.  But it still isn't the best film of the year, and I'd give the Foreign Award to Yi Yi, a film that I feel is much more ""foreign"" in its origins than CTHD.",991872000,2,1022,4.5271739130434785

The flying is spectacular, the romance is exciting, and the movie has a feminine, not masculine attitude. One example is the scene when Jen Yu fights a huge group of men in a restaurant with the Green Destiny sword. However, the movie isn't really that great. The design of the film. Instead of listening the characters speak English, you have to read the subtitles and keep your eyes open. That takes out the excitement of the film. The plot and storyline was terrible. It could have been more exciting if Chow-Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi used these sword skills against a Ninja clan rather than a professional witch like Jade Fox. This is why Crouching Tiger was not able to beat Gladiator in the Oscars because a fight for freedom is more interesting than revenge.

I am afraid that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon directed by Ang Lee, and starring Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh had the Python effect on me. The fight scenes I had heard so much about seemed more childish than fanciful and the chases across the rooftops and trees were little better than Peter Pan (where you could see the wires).
In addition I had heard that the story was moving and classic. I don't think characters circling around a petulant princess as classic. I found it tiresome and was hoping throughout the film that something awful would happen to her. The only satisfying aspect of the story was the wisdom given to the older characters which was refreshing.
All in all Crouching Tiger doesn't please. It leaves you disliking the young heroine and wishing they had spent more time on a truly classic story and less on wires and questionable effects.

1136443,5,7883631101,"This movie is truly the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen.  The landscapes and cities are breathtaking in their beauty.  Along with the cinematography, there is an action-packed martial arts film with a romantic film hidden inside, truly something for everyone.  The story is based on Chinese legends-2 ""old"" (in their 40s) warriors become enmeshed in what may be their final adventure when a thief steals a legendary sword.  Although the thief seems to be young, her methods are those of an old enemy of the warriors.  In addition, they are faced with a princess who is about to be forced into an arranged marriage, but who harbors a secret affair with a bandit chieftain.  For those unfamiliar with Hong Kong action or The Matrix, there are plenty of stunts done with concealed wires, allowing the characters to run across water,  leap from rooftop to rooftop, and setting up a beautifully choreographed battle among the treetops of the countryside. Unbelievable?  No more unbelievable than the the Clint Eastwood characters who never miss with guns that never run out of ammo.  No more unbelievable than Bruce Willis outrunning fireballs from bomb blasts. For those who hate subtitles, on DVD with the English language option, this is the best dubbed Chinese language film I've ever seen.  No bad actors with funny voices here, the dubbing does not detract from the film's quality.  I've now seen it with subtitles, dubbed and, although I don't speak or understand Chinese, plan to watch it in Chinese with no subtitles just to listen to the actors' voices.  This film should have beat Gladiator for best film of the year.  No matter how  you feel about foreign films, you owe it to yourself to see this film.",991872000,3,1726,4.866438356164384
1136444,5,7883631101,"man, the critics never like the movies i do, but i can tell you one thing, the critics got this movie absolutely right.  this is one of the best movies i have EVER  seen.  first off the dialogue is written great.  it has structure, so they have the words in common man's english on the bottom of the screen (at least on the dvd), but it adds a lot of realism to the movie.
the visuals are also spectacular.  the fighting scenes alone are worth the price of the movie.  think of the matrix with swords and ten times better.  the moves sometimes could be described as dragon ball z without the fireballs and explosions, very cool.  the locations, actually filmed in china, are great.
but don't think your going to get some stupid rambo movie though. the plot here has many twist and turns, dealing with backstabbing, deciet (probably spelled wrong), revenge, love, and honor.  i won't tell you anything more because the story unfolds in layers beuatifully.
but overall this movie has it all, special effects, great story, and great acting. if you don't have this, you better go up the page and click on the buy button now.",991785600,,1120,4.532338308457711

Crotching Tiger... stands as one of those filmes with an epic story and a beautifully written script. The dialogue is so marvelous that if you watch it dubbed it actually affects the emotions u feel as a viewer!! But what truly puts this film above everything else that has been placed on the screen in the last 20 years-yeah I said 20!(few exceptions granted). Is the message and the world upon which you are placed. Crouching tiger allows women to soar, fight, feel and still remain women. The female characters are not butched up and made into hulking animals and that's the beauty of this film. Its like Brontye with fight scenes!! And for all the punches and sword slashing the film never once masks the beauty of the martial arts allowing the fights to take place in an almost dream like settting.

It is a very beautiful movie, the story is perfectly intertwined with it's scenery- both are equally impressive. It is a fantasy action/adventure/love story that is rightfully dubbed an ""instant classic.""  Which brings us to the much awaited DVD version.
I was impressed with the amount of extras this bare-bones edition has to offer, much more than most other non-special editions on the market .  I would reccomend buying it today than waiting for a deluxe edition to come out a few months from now.  The transfer is near-perfect, the only drawback is not having a movie theater sized screen in your house.  My only complaint comes from the voice-over work.  It is overdescriptive and more flamboyant than the original lines, and at times changes and adds new lines.  I reccomend first time viewers to take in the original Mandarin language version with subtitles first, then going back and seeing it with the English dub.  My money is on the original, but some would say otherwise.  Either way- if you are a fan of great scenery, action, love, or drama,  BUY THIS MOVIE. NOW.  =)",991785600,5,1218,4.752380952380952
1136548,5,7883631101,"Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a thrilling experience. Set in a mythical, 19th century China, it's ""Star Wars"" for adults; part martial arts revenge tale, part epic love story, and wholly unforgettable.
 Michelle Yeoh plays Yu Shu Lien, entrusted by her longtime friend, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), to deliver his famous Green Destiny sword as a gift to a patron During this mission, Shu Lien meets Jen Yu, a young noblewoman, soon to marry and very unhappy with her impending fate. Played by Zhang Ziyi, Jen eventually propels both Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai on a quest for two destinies: the Green sword, and Jen's.
 This is one of Michelle Yeoh's finest performances. She imbues the warrior Shu Lien with both strength, and a restrained longing for Li Mu Bai. She says more with expressions than many actors do with an entire scriptful of dialogue. Yeoh definitely needs to be in more movies, martial arts or otherwise. Similarly, Chow Yun Fat makes a redoubtable hero as Li Mu Bai, as his best intentions careen out of control thanks to the impetuous Jen.
 Speaking of whom, Zhang Ziyi literally steals ""Crouching Tiger"" from the more experienced leads. Full of fierce anger, limitless energy, and an impulsive, headstrong personality, Jen Yu's a tornado of emotions and actions, in contrast to the older warriors' dutiful restraint. As she moves from childhood into adulthood without balance, she makes some terrible decisions, and her final choice lingers, and haunts. Jen Yu, as embodied by Zhang Ziyi, is a cinematic creation easily the equal of Vivian Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara, or Kim Darby's spunky Mattie Ross from ""True Grit.""
 And if the story hasn't flirted with sensory overload enough, the film even finds time for a long, David Lean-esque flashback sequence. In its desert setting and horseback thrills, it recalls ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and with its romanticism, ""Dr. Zhivago."" It comes at a pivotal point for Jen, and would make an entertaining movie by itself.
 Apart from its emotions and scope, the film's also a kinetic experience. After lyrical character interludes, the plot explodes into several eye-popping action set-pieces. Like cinematic helium, it soars, just as the characters fly over rooftops, duel with a variety of weapons, and clash on the top layers of a bamboo forest. And always, the adventure and action evolve from personal choices and needs, rather than the desire to fill time and space with bombast. This, in itself, is a minor miracle in today's CGI explosion-rocked film culture.
 The supporting players add to the adventure, as well. Pei-Pei Cheng plays Jade Fox, Li Mu Bai's nemesis; she's more than a one-dimensional villain (to say why would reveal a bit too much). And Chang Chen, as Lo, Jen's bandit-king lover, is by turns hilarious and charismatic.
 The DVD features a crisp print of the movie (superior to the one I saw in the theater), filmmaker commentary, a ""making-of"" special, and a Michelle Yeoh featurette (oh yeah!). I'm a subtitle purist, but I've sampled several scenes with the English dubbing, and it's surprisingly well-done; it's adequate for sharing the film with young (or older) people who won't be able to keep up with the subtitles. Still, for the full experience, I recommend the subtitled version, because it preserves the actors' original performances.
 ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the finest films I've ever seen, and my personal favorite. It's outstanding in every way, and deserves to be in your collection alongside ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Citizen Kane."" Splendid, splendid stuff, as bold and as beautiful as Jen Yu, as quiet and as philosophical as Li Mu Bai.",991785600,,3661,5.009868421052632
1136549,5,7883631101,"This film is one of the greatest movies ever made. I rarely ever watch a movie more than once, but I have already seen this one 3 times in 4 days. Twice in Mandarin and once dubbed in English. Yes, I think it's that good. With superb acting, breathtaking fight sequences, and a touching story, this is why we we all watch movies in the first place. But this film isn't simply watched, it is ""experienced"". Director Ang Lee does an excellent job of making the viewers feel as if they are actually in the movie. We feel the unspoken love between Li Mu Bai(Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien(Michelle Yeoh) and also the youthful exhuberant love between Jen Yu(Zhang Ziyi) and Lo(Chang Chen). We are placed right in the center of ancient China with beautiful art direction and scenery, and we have a front row seat to all of the fight scenes with clever camera angles. Lee's depiction of The Green Destiny sword is equally impressive. At first glance the beautifully decorated sword appears to be weak and bends at the slightest touch, but when it's used in battle it seems to be unstoppable.
The fight sequences are especially impressive in that they are not just mindless martial arts fighting. You will see a big difference in the fight scenes of Crouching Tiger and the fight scenes of other martial arts films. Punches and kicks are fast and fluid, and the fighting is more dramatic in that it also reveals the characters' emotions. Jade Fox fights with anger, Jen with youthful confidence, and Yu Shu Lien with mature grace. I'd say this movie puts the ""art"" in martial arts. As usual, Yuen Wo Ping, best known in the U.S. for his work on The Matrix, has done some amazing fight choreography. I'd rate this up there with one of his other works, Tai Chi Master(Twin Warriors).
The music in Crouching Tiger is beautiful and fits each scene perfectly. Whether it's the fast drums during a fight, or the slow cello sounds during an emotional scene, the music never seems out of place. The combination of Tan Dun's musical compositions and Yo-Yo Ma's cello solos have made me want to go out and buy the soundtrack as well.
With such an amazing film, it's surprising it only took $15 million to make. Now that I've finally seen this movie, I'm also suprised it did not clean house at the Oscars. Gladiator was a wonderful movie, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an epic masterpiece. Steven Soderbergh did an excellent job with Traffic, but Ang Lee is the definition of filmmaker and has raised the bar for every other director.
This DVD is loaded with extras including interviews with some cast members, a special ""making of"" segment, a lengthy photo montage that plays with all the music from the movie in the background, and detailed filmographies of all the main cast. However, I would recommend you watch the movie before you watch any of the extras because some of the interviews give away important parts of the story. If I had one complaint about this DVD, it would be that the dubbing is only above average. However, it is significantly better than the dubbing of most Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies, and I thought the voice they chose for Jen Yu fit her character very well. Most people would probably watch both versions(dubbed and subtitled) anyway, so this really isn't that big of an issue.
I would recommend this movie even if you are not a big martial arts fan like me. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is so much more than just another martial arts flick. It is love, romance, drama and action all combined into one film. To use the words of Ang Lee, this movie is ""Sense and Sensibility with martial arts.""",991785600,4,3615,4.614906832298137

1136703,5,7883631101,"I could judge this film a number of ways.  Being a huge martial arts fan, if I had judged this as a martial arts film, I would have been very disappointed.  Simply put, the fights are way over-done.  They are so exaggerated that the characters look silly and robotic and there is none of the grace and brilliance that can be found in Bruce Lee's better films.  I know seeing the characters leaping across the screen is amazing for many but I found it to be simply silly and not very engaging at all.
But if Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, disappoints as a martial arts film, it brilliantly succeeds as an epic fair-tale brought to life on screen.  The whole film has a magical yet realistic quality to that is so rarely seen in films.  It's like the audience is experiencing a Chinese fable but realizing that there is far more to the story than is written in books (a good example of this is the fact that the main villain is a fat old woman).  Heros soar across the screen majestically but still feel human.  The cast perfectly exemplify this.  They feel like characters ripped from fables but given real feelings and emotions.  All the actors do wonderful jobs in their roles.
It's also worth noting just how amazing the cinematography is.  In nearly every shot we see another beautiful outlook of China.  The fights while over-down are still very well-directed by Ang Lee and are dizzying and amazing at the same time.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a unique film.  As a martial arts movie it may be disappointing but as an epic fairy-tail it is un-matched.  Director Ang Lee and an strong cast successfully create a living, breathing world of which has never been seen in a film.  That alone is worth the price of admission.",991699200,,1732,4.559870550161812

1136707,5,7883631101,"I'll probably be repeating the praise already lavished on this film, but since it absolutely blew me away, I feel compelled to write a review.
This movie was like nothing I have seen before.  I knew the fight scenes were going to be worth the price of admission alone, but the movie had much, much more to offer.
This movie is layered with many things happening at once.  We see a passionate romance interlocking with a tragic one.  These all play out amidst a double-sided revenge plot.  Throw in breathtaking cinematography (which garnered a well deserved Oscar), a perfect soundtrack (another deserved Oscar), acting that really conveys the complex emotions of the characters, beautiful set designs and locations, AND THEN the greatest action scenes I have ever seen, and you have a superb film.
Other aspects of the film have made it rise to the level of great films in my mind.  The film does not cater to the formula of box office success.  It actually takes time to set up the first fight.  The characters don't speak English with a Chinese accent.  There is minimal blood or gore, few deaths, no nudity, and no obscenities.  Ang Lee strives for the old-fashioned method of storytelling, devoid of the easy gimmicks mentioned above, and lets the story and sincerity of the characters move us (plus killer action).
This movie is also very unique in terms of its genre busting aspects.  It blends kung-fu and drama like no film I have ever seen.  The women are just as strong as the men in the film, and the kung-fu is shot with an attention to detail that is usually absent from such films.  Things like this have been waiting to be done for a long time, and Ang Lee has done them right.
I gained a huge amount of respect for Ang Lee because of this.  I think it is quite a challenge to make a film without the typical R-rated material in films today, and still present a beautifully told, mature movie.  He took on the challenge head on and succeeded through his perfectionism.
And a word should be said about the fight scenes.  Amazing.
If you haven't seen this film, or have only seen it once, I suggest multiple viewings.  It is very hard to catch everything that is going on in the film, and once you understand what they are saying, you can begin to really savor the film making craft of Ang Lee and company.",991612800,,2320,4.540865384615385
1136708,5,7883631101,"What makes this movie so good ? I think it's basically a good integration of elements. It has splendid Art Direction, amazing scenery, great acting and of course a fantastic story which is very well told and directed.
It's a story of love but is also a journey into a place where the eternal fight between good and evil takes unexpected twists and kidnaps your attention from begining to end, plus it's surrounded by incredible scenery of mountains, bamboo forests, waterfalls, mandarin castles and villages which makes it delightful for the eye.
The fighting scenes ( which i think are not the main merit of this movie ) are very well done. I know there will be people who think they are stupid and far removed from reality, but if we criticise this movie with that perspective, we can end up saying every epic and mythological story is worthless just because they talk about fantasy and unintelligible situations....
My recommendation is to see this movie,if you don't like it, don't worry, perhaps you'll get a chance to exchange it for The mummy returns or the last Arnold movie.",991612800,,1083,4.76595744680851

I was spellbound with the grace that the action sequences in this movie possessed. I gasped with joy when witnessing the freedom the characters in the movie had that empowered them to leap effortlessly from rooftop to rooftop. The director uses these sequences to demonstrate the awesome powers its characters have. The action in this movie left me paralyzed enough that I could have watched it a few more times just like that, but then I got something else that was completely unexpected. In my opinion, the love stories in this movie sinks the Titanic with one blow. The unspoken love between the two main characters has touched my heart deeply. Another love between the two younger characters was a delightful addition as well. The story is something to be appreciated also. The plot sets the stage for its sequences perfectly, consisting of a master who wishes to train the thief of his legendary sword to wield its power through discipline understanding, and there are a few turns and detours which keep the action rolling. This movie has all of the moves. The story is brilliant, the acting is flawless, the action sequences are breath taking, and the love story is pure and original. You would be a fool not to at least watch this movie. My heart nearly exploded at a dozen different scences in this movie. At times... the movie is almost to much to grasp, too much to handle.

The subtitles and the rave reviews I'd seen are what prompted me to go see the movie. I'm a Bruce Lee fan and always loved his fighting choreography. This movie has the same poetry in motion choreography that Bruce Lee's movies had, probably even better. I'm also a very visual person, and the stunts and special effects took my breath away. My 17 year old daughter, who isn't a martial arts fan, loved this movie too and insisted that I buy the DVD when it comes out next week.

1136930,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not your average foreign film, or for that matter your average regular film. Ang Lee conveys such an artistic and (there's no other word for it)cool film. He uses ancient mythology to narate a story not of martial arts but of art itself. The flying thorugh trees the romance and the Dialouge, though in mandarin portray why this film is truely excelent.
I belived it was the best film of the year 2000 and deserved best picture. But don't take the Academy's Word on Gladiator... Gladiator is a good movie, but it's a classic hero wins, hero dies situation. Crouching Tiger is a new kind of classic, the kind that will WOW Cannes and Sundance, the kind that will make your head spin with the story and look. The wire technique is not used in a Matrix-style way, it is so much better (in my opinion) in Crouching Tiger. The way Michelle Yeoh scales the side of the wall is so profound and really takes you to this legendary world Lee has created (with help from the tales) and portrayed on film.
Don't watch this movie thinking of a blockbuster, it's not (spite it's $116 Mil. or some what gross), this film is an artistic voyage that you will not regret taking. Plus the fight sequences are so sweet!!!
Enjoy the film, it's all ya gotta do to have fun. Hopefully we will see more movies like this in the future, if we're lucky. Don't miss this once in a hundred, brilliant, star of a movie.",990662400,7,1422,4.452107279693487

Yes it is a love story, and a true work of art considering it's cast of characters.  You couldn't ask for better acting...That was best and biggest surprise of all.

My Opinion: This is not a classical Hong Kong Kung Fu movie where everything centers around a number of fight scenes. This movie has in depth characters, multiple plot lines, good acting and direction. It is an epic love story about two couples. The martial arts fit into the story seamlessly.  Thet are not the reason for the story, they are just part of it. I am a fan of the cheesy dubbed in Black Belt theater movie and CTHD is heads above those.
DVD Quality: It's anamorphic yeah! There are plenty of extras and an English language track that I found to be better than the subtitles (they said different things!!!).

When I first heard Ang Lee was going to make a kung fu movie I was skeptical, but intrigued. He had never made a movie I didn't like, but they are all so sluggishly paced and focused solely on character. Possibly the polar opposite to your average chop socky film.  Nevertheless the outcome is nothing short of miraculous. After a purposely slow opening we are thrown into a spectaular fight sequence between Michelle Yeoh and a mysterious intruder. From then on the action is constantly mirrored by moving performances from Michelle, Chow Yun Fat and newcomer Ziyi Zhang.  The story is really just a simple fairy tale complicated by real emotions. The action has a grace and fluidity to it that no western film (even The Matrix) has yet achieved. I cannot recommend this film enough. The proof of its power came at the end when normally people stand and leave the second the credits appear. The cinema was almost full yet no one moved, most sat right through to the very end.

1137063,5,7883631101,"There are so many things Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does right. First of all, the action is great. It is majestic and graceful and, most importantly, complex, as all good action should be. There are martial arts hand-to-hand fights as well as intense sword duels, and it's all done with the style of a complex dance. This is indeed one of the best forms of action you can have. When it all clicks, it's great. Like The Matrix, CTHD liberates its fighters by having them superpowered, letting them run up walls and fly, and this gives the action a feeling of freedom and limitless bounds. The influence is undeniably there. And like The Matrix, CTHD's action is better than what you'd find in, say, Jackie Chan films because it trusts the magic of martial arts enough to actually use martial arts, and the results are far more impressive than any Chan film, simply because the action is there as action, not as a side-dish to predictable sight jokes. (Not to mention that there is a good plot, too). ...
This film is an epic, and makes sure it lets us know that, by creating some very nice visuals throughout. All the wide, detailed shots of Peking, the Forbidden City, are breathtaking, and the film is packed with beautiful, almost mystical settings like mountains, valleys, deserts, and forests. Not as grandly detailed and imaginative as, say, The Phantom Menace or Gladiator, but it still transports you to the time and place very well.
And there are only a few flaws. Yes, this film, which probably has an average rating of 4 stars among the critics, still has flaws. Okay, maybe that word is too harsh; there are things that could've been improved on. There aren't that many. For one thing, the film never lets us in on the background and philosophy of the surreal fighting style that allows the fighter to float. It is a film's job to let us in; for some reason here, it's left abandoned. And no, it's not tasteful mystique; the film could easily let us know more about the style without giving anything away. Look at Star Wars- we end up knowing a lot about The Force in the first film alone, yet none of its mystique is lost. I'm not saying CTHD should've explained everything away; I'm saying it should've given us more background on the philosophies and practices involving the fighting style.  It is too bad CTHD doesn't do this, because it would not only add to the action but the story as well, as it would certainly bring up interesting philosophical themes.
The only other flaw isn't so much a flaw as it is a section of the film. One part, where the film flashes back to the origins of the romance between the princess character and Lo, a bandit, isn't handled very gracefully. It ruins the great momentum of the film by suddenly taking thirty minutes to focus on the two weakest characters and actors in the film to focus on a pretty typical romance subplot, which could have easily been done in five minutes without losing any effect.
As for the DVD of this film, it contains the usual features, like documentaries and behind-the-scenes videos, which aren't very special and don't provide much insight into the film itself. But what it also has is one of the best features any good DVD should have: director's commentary. With this, you can watch the entire film over again as Ang Lee talks you through it.
This is a great film. With some fabulous action scenes (the best one involves Yeoh and Ziyi dueling in her training room, and Yeoh basically goes through every weapon on the rack fighting her), pretty visuals, a solid story with good chemistry between the characters, fine acting (Yeoh is the best), and a nice moody score, CTHD is yet another great holiday-season film, an excellent action/epic, and one of the best martial arts films you'll ever see.

1137066,4,7883631101,"I've seen this movied for 3 times.  First, I saw the videotape of the movie before it even came to states.  Since it's a copy that didn't come with great quality ( no background music, differnt voice talent ), I was still shocked by its martial sequences.  Second, I saw the movoie in a theather which locates closes to 3rd street (Santa Monica, CA) when CTHD was only released in a limited amount of theaters, I was totally overwhelmed by the score and sound effect that i missed in my first experience.  Third, I finally got to see the movie in a big stadum theater which is close to my house.  All I could hear were ""wow""  and ""incredible"" through the entire movie.
Ang Lee again delivered his ""kung-fu"" (for directing, not for fighting) in making this movie.  As he did in his previous movies, he successfuly added some emotion-conflict touches into this movie.  Unlike other martial-art movies, Ang Lee magically transformed fighting parts into dancing-like scenes with the help from martiak-art director Yuen Wo-Ping ( who earned reputation in America with his success in Matrix).  Some viewers think that the story line is not rich enough.  I think the writeer did a pretty good job at arranging scences, cuz' the movie's just about a TINY section of a Chinese novel. Some viewers think that the subtitle is too annoying.  As a Taiwanese, I think the subtitle palys a big role to lead no-speaking-mandarin viewers to experience the beauty of Chinese culture and  the script  writers Ang Lee and  James Schamus did a heck of job.  James Schamus actually flied back and forth between China and America to meet AngLee for several times to make the subtitles.  Whoever you are, you gotta see this movie.

As Ang Lee already said in the DVD's interview, we grew up watching this kind of fantasy movies with struggling heros, fantastic fightings and flying around and he always wanted to put something on screen.  BUT Lee set a new view that not only new to western audience, but we also see it as something we have never seen before in such ""wu xia"" movies: the fighting and chasing scenes by the girls in the palace, the chasing scene on the lake and forest by Chow and Zhang, are really really refreshing experiences to us.  Added bouns are Tan's music arrangement and Yoyo Ma's performance, this is not only a fantastic but also an artistic movie.
But all Chow Yun-fat fans alert, this is not a Chow's movie.  His acting in this movie is just ok (limited by the character)and he only appears in a few scenes; the main characters, are Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, who performed very well and deserve a big hand.

Many detractors argue that Croutching Tiger is nothing new in terms of martial arts films from Asia.  Having seen a number of HK movies, I would have to both agree and disagree.  The action sequences are not as extravagant as some other Asian martial arts movies, but it was also more realiztic to watch.  In addition, I would argue that the plot is much more robust.

The fact that this movie was subtitled does not detract from this film at all.  At times, the translations do not fully convey the meaning of what was spoken, but most of the information is conveyed.

Strong acting performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, breathe-taking cinematography, and exciting action sequences make Croutching Tiger a movie to own and watch multiple times.",988588800,4,950,4.89375
1137175,5,7883631101,"I read the review of smokingbear where he attacks the authenticity of the film, starting from the fact that most actors are not native Mandarin speakers to the Taiwanese guy that plays the Turkic horseman from Xinjian (by the way, I take offense to your calling Taiwanese-spoken Mandarin ""sissy"").  Like most epics from historical periods, it's practically impossible to satisfy so-called ""historians,""  mostly when there is a short supply of world-reknowned Mandarin speaking actors/actresses.
I totally disagree with his belief that the plot is weak.  Ang Lee (who is Taiwanese and studied at NYU) has a knack for blending Eastern and Western qualities in his films.  Being half-Taiwanese and half American, I can appreciate both aspects.  The film is not traditional in the sense of Chinese storytelling and it cannot be concretely categorized into any genre.  I wouldn't compare it to an ""American Chinese Restaurant"" like smokingbear however.  It is made to be accessible to western viewers, however it is by no means watered down.  It is more of a fusion rather than being made merely to appeal to American tastes.
I feel the Western style of storytelling lended the film a softer, more human quality than what you would find in traditional Chinese stories.  It gives the viewer insight into the forces acting upon the psyches of the characters.  The conflict of Confucian obligation and human urges is a good example.  The viewer becomes more emotionally involved with the characters this way.
Of course, if you're a member of the genre police, you wouldn't appreciate the movie quite as much.",988502400,4,1600,5.091954022988506
1137325,5,7883631101,"A relatively unknown and often quickly dismissed title at first, Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" received the highest return of any foreign film in history at this year's Academy Awards- and it still did not receive it's due credit.  ""Crouching Tiger"", a throwback to the wuxia (Kung-Fu Fantasy) films which director Ang Lee watched as a child, goes farther than any other film in the genre.  The breathtakingly choreographed fight sequences left the audience appluading in their seats (literally), and the poignant ending left even the most hardened of action movie fans with an expression of deep reflection.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the perfect synthesis of  incredible action and powerful acting, a definite must-buy.",988416000,3,744,5.387931034482759

Pack all the extras on the DVD you want, you won't catch me buying it.  After a painfully slow first half hour, we finally get a fight scene and the action is pretty great (although, some of the infamous flying sequences are over the top).  Unfortunately, the action is always followed by more dialogue and story, both of which are wretched.  How this movie, with its ... dialogue (dumb lines like ""I will avenge my master!"" over and over) was nominated for a screenplay Oscar is beyond me.  If you loved it, buy it.  If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to rent this first -- I and others I know were excited when this came out in theaters, but thoroughly disappointed by the dullness of it all.",988416000,10,861,4.277777777777778

Director Ang Lee maestry takes us to a journey through a visionary world of tigers and dragons where our imagination, our emotions and dreams come true. The cinematography is magic and sublime. The soundtrack epic and triumphant. The performances truly emotional, specially by Michelle Yeoh. And the story is simply extraordinary. An unforgettable cinematic experience.
Behind every scene, every take, from the most outstanding battles to the most introspective ones, there is hidden poetry declaimed by means of images. You just need to develop an eye for this, in order to find out what a best picture is about.",988416000,4,841,5.101449275362318
1137328,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the greatest martial arts movie I've ever seen. Like all great films in the genre, there are reams of battles, but Director Ang Lee has taken things farther. His movie isolates and preserves the pivotal element of personal excellence over the conflict itself. It is uniquely heroic to see a warrior's gravity defying leaps and bounds, conquer his enemy through virtuous character as much as actual feats of combat prowess, and stand triumphant over a legion of his inferiors (individual vs. the collective?).
When I saw this movie with a friend of mine who generally derided martial arts movies for their silliness, even she was amazed by the battle choreography and deeply touched by the story. Intensifying the combat is the simple romance which captures an intimate quality often missing from these movies. The skillful translation, combined with the subtle yet effective acting, layers the fundamentals of the story with emotional clarity that conveys these feelings, instead of just telling the player of them. The scenery is often beautiful, capturing the Romanticism of the setting and the story.
And the battle scenes... Awe-inspiring in their speed and athletics, I've never seen more exhilarating physical confrontations. I cannot describe the breathless sense of urgency enjoined by these fights, which are tests are character as much as battles. Watching the battles more than once reveals a remarkable level of depth and ingenuity behind the choreography. The greatest combative moment in the film comes in an unconventional setting: treetops. Here, the characters bound across the leafy canopy, trading blows with a shriek of steel that seems out of place in a setting so exquisite. It's like poetry in motion. Just watching it gave me shivers.
An amazing film; so much more than a martial arts movie.",988329600,6,1849,5.208053691275167

I'm always going to be a kid who loves this kind of stuff - stories that revel in the impossible and the fantastic and the exhilaration of adventures in the imagination. That's said as both a loyal member of the Spielberg generation and also as a hopefully halfway serious student of Chinese culture, being an Asian-Australian kid who can empathise heart and soul with filmmaker Ang Lee's need to recreate and show us a 'dream of China'. He's a filmmaker I admire greatly and hope to emulate one day.
Well, this is the dream come almost true. I don't presume to correct others' opinions on the film - clearly it has touched millions of people in a way it didn't quite do for me - and I'd been living in anticipation for months. I believe that CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is, ultimately, a blessing more for what it has made possible than what it is in itself. I'm glad that it's dazzled so many people in the West, and everywhere around the world. It makes me wonder how people will react when they realize how much more can be achieved in this genre that they can't even begin to imagine.
If there was a problem for me it's that the excitement, laughter and beauty of the film were, rather like Yu Shu Lien, too rarely permitted to burst the bonds of restraint and _really_ take me soaring. It could be fitting, especially in a film about social restraint, I suppose; but then I would say more detail about the social world of the characters would have made the action and the love story deeper than they were. It's not an epic without a vast world of secondary characters and conflicts teeming behind it; pretty widescreen landscapes and plenty of fighting seem to have been the sole criteria for most people using the term. I'd have called it something else.
The story as it stands mostly serves to treat the viewer to rapturous displays of cinematic poetry in the scenery, sentiment and action, and the film certainly delivers on those counts. But I prefer my plots to have more grip and bite than what you'll get here.
But please don't let this arch-sounding sentiment stop you from enjoying a film which promises to be quite likely one of the most graceful, poetic and invigorating fantasies you've ever seen, [....] Hope it opens your eyes to other forms of cinema coming out of Asia today.
As for the actual DVD - if the US release matches the Asian one, we'll all be very happy with one of the slickest packages ever.",988243200,12,2435,4.536363636363636
1137330,5,7883631101,"Because Crouching Tiger was released in Taiwan before it came to the States, it is only natural that the DVD was released there earlier, too.  Nearly identical to the proposed Ameican release (the US version adds the ""making of"" documentary), I purchased a copy of the Region 3 version of this great movie.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon itself is a gorgeous, sensual story, boosting HK action movies to an entirely new level (although it is doubtful that many will be able to or even want to follow this act).  The story is fairly straightforward: a master swordsman searches for his lost weapon, stolen by an enigmatic thief.  Add to that a healthy dose of unrequited love, another love story that may very well become unrequited, and of course the legendary fighting scenes, and you've got a great film.
Subtitles don't really matter here, unlike some other films.  After 5 minutes, you won't even notice you're reading them.
Now, for information on the DVD.
The commentary track, in English, is one of the best tracks I've heard.  Rather than the usual back-patting (so-and-so was SO GREAT to work with!), Ang Lee and James Schamus discuss the difficulties behind making scripted scenes come to life, the risks they took in making the movie (10 minutes before the first fight? A 20 minute flashback?), and other aspects of production.  For those who like an educational commentary, this one is great.
The interview with Michele Yeoh is pretty much the standard movie-promotion fare, and the music videos are interesting as additions (for some reason, they seem really grainy, too).  This DVD looks and sounds great, and even the animated menus (if they keep the ones that are on the Region 3 disc) are clever.
There are very few DVDs that are ""must-own.""  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of them.  Do not hesitate, and when it comes, savor every minute.",988156800,7,1863,4.870253164556962

Not too many of my friends understood the ending, I only accepted it as the way of ... Chinese Bushido.
All in all, it's a good movie, despite of the hype.  I get the DVD so I can understand the dialogues, subtitles just made me missed lots of scenes.",988156800,,561,4.264150943396227

All elements of this film flow together like a fine stew. Drop a dash of Chinese mythology, a sprinkling of martial arts mayhem, and a heaping helping of, possibly, the most beautiful landscapes and images put to film, and you cannot help but like this movie.

1137333,5,7883631101,"The movie is a masterpiece and has earned worldwide compliment.  The most critical part for Chinese speakers is that Chow (as Li Mu-Bai) and Yeon (as Yu Shiu-Lien) are not speaking good Mandarin.  I would like to see this point in a humorous way: the movie is winner of best foreign film.  It explains all: it is a best foreign film for Chinese and non-Chinese speakers.
It is important to accept this point of view, because from 12th century there are people moving in the big territory, it is not possible that everyone speaks good Peking accent, even in the capital, people from all provinces and merchants traveling on silk roads.  The Ching Dynasty was established by Manchu, the race has dialect and writing system from northeast China.  If we have more understanding on the background, it will be much easier to accept the film as a foreign film in stead of a Chinese language film.
What does Chinese language film mean?  Crunching Tiger Hidden Dragon was directed by Taiwanese Ang Lee; performed by Chow (HK), Yeon (Malaysia), Zang Ziyi (as Jen, from China), and Chang Chen (as Lo, from Taiwan); photographed and designed by the best art professionals from HK; music composed by Tan Dun, from China and now in US; music played by Yoyo Ma; film published by Sony Classic (Japanese owned, registered in US).  In the Academy nomination list, this is a Taiwan film, but in my opinion it is a global work.
If we see things this way, we will not be limited by the language.  The movie is a masterpiece in both art achievement and commercial success.  It shows the Kung-Fu that we Chinese has never seen, brings the magnificent landscape to every theater around the world, and replaces my painful memory of 19th century China with the extraordinary beauty and wonder that is possibly never exists in human history.
My suggestion is: take it easy, and relax to enjoy a movie, its just a movie, not a literature work that you need to sit straight and read between the lines.  Remember when Jen escaped from Los cave and lost in the desert and felt asleep, when she woke up, she is in the cave again.  Everybody in theater laughs, but the whole scene has no dialog.  This is the charming and attraction of movies, and it is the reason why it breaks down and barrier of language and race to be one of the most influential media today.",988070400,12,2331,4.603864734299517

To those who find wire-work martial arts action to be silly, this might be too much.  The most important thing to remember is that this is a fantasy!

Truth is, the martial arts in the film is the icing on the cake, the filling is in its script. Having seen this film in its true original form, mandarin, I fear that many aspects of teh film would be lost in the subtitles and translation. The script is beautifully written and filled with metaphors that compares both modern society with that of the imaginery, the martial arts world. To the chinese, Wu Lin, is a term used in all martial arts world. It signifies the period in China's history where the kingdom is ruled by emperors and martial artistes dwells. However, the modern notion of Wu Lin is the society we live in. Like the Wu LIn in the film, modern men are trapped by duty and reponsibilities. The love affair between Zhang Zi Yi and Zhang Zhen, is a symobolism social barriers in traditional families.  Unlike traditional martial arts films, look to Jackie Chan's eariler works such as ""Drunken Master"" for comparison, Lee Ang's piece is uniquely silent with many compelling scene. Hence, I am with the firm believe that considering the film an A-typical martial arts film would be nothing less than insult.

We read the subtitles and did not feel like we were missing any details -- only that a world had suddenly been opened for us to view.
Since we saw this film, we have discussed it and persuaded others to experience this enchantment.  Every so often we talk about this movie and plan to see it many more times.  This DVD should be shown in wide-angle format in order to see all of the majesty captured on cellulose.
The script creates a perfectly logical connection between fantasy and reality, logic and irrationality,  and mythology and truth.  This flow makes it easy to suspend disbelief and be completely entrapped within the breathtaking beauty and fierce fights of the movie.
Yun-Fat Chow is Li Mu Bai, and he displays a spiritual countenance that is the center of a true martial arts master.  His life has been in service and honor toward the sword *The Green Destiny.*  The complexities of his life and his choices are only a background for the intricacies of romance, tragedy, heroism, and philosophy that are woven with precise skill and art throughout this astonishing movie.
Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) and Zhang Ziy (Jen) become acquaintances, then friends, then sisters, and finally enemies.  The transitions are created by the strong will of the young princess (Zhang) who ultimately learns the value of friendship, but at great cost.  She is well trained in the ninja arts by Li Mu Bai's ancient arch nemesis.  This training is significant because rivals do tend to reveal the inadequacies of their opponents while assuring their young students with victory.
The action scenes are stimulating and plausible though the stunts are physically impossible -- or so it seems.  What is most amazing is that these impossible stunts were real!  The actors did the scenes, perhaps stunt doubles for some, though I doubt it because of Ang Lee's determination for accuracy.  When the warriors fly through the air, fight on the sides of building, chase across the rooftops, or fight high in the bamboo trees they did exactly that.  These were not created through simulation and the magic of technology.
After the scenes were filmed then the digital artists worked to remove the equipment that helped the actors complete the feats.  The visions of China and the exciting ninja action captured my imagination.
Ang Lee required the actors to learning to speak Mandarin Chinese.  The language accuracy may not seem important to those of us who do not speak Chinese, but it is the difference between cultures within China.  I was left with the feeling that I had spent time in a sacred place.
Throughout the film there is the artistry of the music.  Segments will take you to dreamland while other sequences will cause a rush of adrenaline.  It is as if you are riding on a magic carpet -- you are there.
I purchased two DVDs -- one for me and one for my nephew -- *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* is that good.

Actually my title is a play on this years' Oscars prime contenders for the Best Film award. So this film review is as much as extolling the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, as well as acknowledging its counterpart in this crucible of film excellence.
What is it they say about Hollywood, they ""so love an epic"", well then it was no coincidence that this years raisons d'tre for the Oscars owes a lot to two cities or should I say classical cultures a sort of East meets West saga, a quintessential Yin & Yang juxtaposition, every bit about classic and ancient cultures & philosophies as well as blockbuster filmmaking at its best!
From the coliseums of Rome (that's the other movie) to the grandeur of Peking, the desolate beauty of the ancient Silk Road to the lush, verdant Chinese Bamboo Sea and snowcapped peaks (of Mongolia?), a forbidden love affair unfolds, of two star crossed lovers, and of another subdued and hidden yet poignant/noble love.
The movie is very much story driven with multifarious underlying themes and incisive dialogue (yet there are subtle nuances that are sadly always lost in the translation/dubbing) intertwined in a hypnotic and magical portrayal of events occurring in as Ang Lee himself said... ""kind of a dream of China, a China that probably never existed, except in my boyhood fantasies in Taiwan""... an allegorical setting of ancient feudal China, but likewise having the dimensions of a cultural epic. There is the depiction of feministic beliefs and behavior of our heroine the strong willed and free spirited Jiao Long Yu (Jen) portrayed by newcomer Zhang Zi Yi in contrast to the chaste, demure and elegant love of Yui Hsui Lien, played by Michelle Yeoh, for the enigmatic Li Mu Bai, the indomitable Chow Yun Fat. The fast paced brilliantly and impeccably choreographed action sequences by Yuen Wo Ping (of ""The Matrix"" fame) in contrast with the almost surrealistic landscapes that served as a backdrop to the unfolding of an epic love story.
Again kudos to Ang Lee whose direction is singularly unique in its style and breadth and his cinematographer Peter Pau whose spectacular composition and rendering of the panoramic background landscape is nothing short of a tourist guides' dream package. Exquisite musical scoring by Tan Dun was brilliant, enchanting and heart stirring, certainly Yo Yo Ma's masterful rendering of the sweet, haunting, and melancholic strands of the love song and background theme did it no harm either.

1137539,4,7883631101,"Call it what you will--archetypal fable with a feminist twist, exquisitely choreographed martial arts movie, balletic spectacle balancing image, action, poetry and music--""Crouching Tiger"" is a distinctive variation on familiar genres.  The words ""ballet,"" ""choreography,"" ""Eastern"" exotic myth don't quite do justice in describing the film.  For one, the action sequences are lightning swift--reminiscent of American silent comedies and more suggestive of music than of formal dance.  And certainly the tempo of this music and the pace of the film seem more Western than Eastern (as does the throbbing romantic cello of YoYo Ma).  Some will single out the three female leads in this rite-of-passage archetypal story as the film's most distinctive twist.  But even more novel is the way the form foregrounds allegory and approaches the theme of teaching and learning.  Film is a medium that is normally ""relentless"" in his  representation of the physical world, satisfying viewers' expectations of actions that are at least humanly plausible.  But by making his characters fly all over the frame, director Lee keeps reminding the spectator that if you try to respond this film as another action movie you will not only miss the point entirely but be thoroughly disappointed.  Sword play, flying, and fighting are metaphors for living, learning and loving.  All of the 5 principals in the story are learners--and all are failures to greater and lesser degrees.  In fact, the alleged villain, Jade Fox, is in some respects the most sympathetic of all the characters.  She had access to the most masterful swordsman of all but not to his teaching because of her status as a woman.  At one point sword play is compared with word play, or writing (through the picture-grams of Mandarese script).  Whether the instrument is a sword, a pen, or a brush, the viewer of this enchanting parable is finally enjoined to fashion a personal narrative that rejects pride and selfishness in favor of a life sufficiently disciplined to give itself over to love.",986688000,9,2043,5.170212765957447

What is her story anyway? The girl must learn to become an independent, responsible woman while maintaining traditional values unfurling a deadly Western-like contradiction, unraveling before her.

The sword as if the spirit of past warriors infused it seemingly takes on a life of its own adding power infinitely, the wizards possessing it.

She later in the film recounts in finding brief but unlikely love and the direction seamlessly takes us to another journey in X'ianj'iang.
Someone steals ""Green Destiny"" that night, the climax then begins....
All blame the deadly and frightening female witch, ""Jade Fox"" forstealing the Sword at the compound, who had also poisoned Li Mubai's Master Teacher of the Wudang monastary, significantly weakening her opponents, she once believed.
The two schools fatally weave together and the plot burns to boil in the ultimate though complicated clash between the enchantment of experience and the seduction of evil.
  A million leaves fall  none the same,  different times, different ways  one turning slowly among clouds  a dot on an infinite plane.  Brief tears fall,  tomorrow, a different story made,  cycle never broken,  promises always eternal.
I can say that the spectacular backdrop of Central and Southern Mainland China and the Gobi Desert of X'ianj'iang in the West, gives a fine taste on the work. The length and the depth of fine acting complements Wang Dulu's novel of art and textural composition. Ang Lee's direction adds a fascinating mix of Western ""superhero"" motifs well within Asian traditions, a much needed breathtaking, though tragically, relieving welcome.
With 10 nominations, the winner of four Academy Awards and two Golden Globes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the best foreign language film of the year, including best cinematography, and best director, Ang Lee.

1137541,3,7883631101,"While I enjoyed CTHD and found it entertaining, I can't help but think that if it hadn't been directed by the respected Ang Lee, most critics would have dismissed this as just another martial arts/action movie and wouldn't be vomiting all over themselves to overpraise this and try to top each other with their reviews and supposed wide-eyed wonder at the action sequences.
There really isn't much here that hasn't been seen before; the  running/leaping/flying sequences were fun to watch but I'd seen most of that before (particularly in ""The Matrix"") however I will say I did enjoy the scene in the forest. I didn't have any problems with suspending my disbelief and getting into the film, but overall I didn't think it was anything special. Just a good entertaining movie that in my opinion was wildly overpraised.
If you haven't seen this film yet, go ahead; you'll probably enjoy it but don't believe all the hype.

The desert love sequence stays in the mind long after the film has ended: near silence, rich reds, widescreen landscapes and, best of all, not a wire-flying scene in sight. A whole film of that and I'd have been happy. Sadly, I found the rest of the film far too thin - visually and emotionally - to be rescued by the admittedly impressive ground-based fight sequences. (Wire flying, on the other hand, took me straight back to Spielberg's Hook: a horrible place to be taken back to). Yes, a fantastic cast, but Chow Yun Fat had none of the centred threat that he had in, say, The Replacement Killers and Michelle Yeoh had too much plot work to do. In fact, everyone had too much plot work to do. With a film that had the feel of something hacked down from 3 hours, the plot-hole count mounted horribly as the film progressed and the exposition got increasingly frantic. In the end, incredibly, it felt like such a tiny film - incredibly because Ang Lee has shown he can do the wide sweep of narrative and history, Ride With the Devil was truly a gem.

1137544,5,7883631101,"This movie is pure fantasy, and having said that, one should suspend disbelief with regards to all the flying. But, what an odd movie. It's not a typical Kung Fu movie in that it has an entire substance and gravity all it's own beyond being a mere martial arts flick. And yet, all that aside, the martial arts, mostly Tai Ch'i, are simply breath taking. As a student of Kung Fu, I found the forms and the weapons dead on accurate.  But there are love stories to be told. Stuff of legends, not just superfluous plot fluff to add decor to the story line. There's biting social comentary about the roles of men and women, and class struggle. There is revenge, redemption, and regret oozing from every frame. And more often than not, there are light hearted moments where you can't help but laugh.
  The fact that the movie is subtitled, in my opinion, maintains the integrity of the film it's self. One is given the chance to hear the dialogue and language in it's pure and natural form. After 20 miutes I didn't even notice anymore that I was reading.
  This movie is a jem pure and simple. And how lucky we all are that some people took a risk to give us a trully quality film experience.",986169600,14,1187,4.401826484018265

1137676,5,7883631101,"Let me start by saying that mere words will not do this movie justice. It must be seen to be appreciated. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is quite simply a masterpiece. As such, you(as the viewer)are sown into the very fabric of the main characters one thread at a time. This story is far more than the classic battle of good vs evil, more importantly it is about the battle fought between duty and desire within ourselves.
Many of the scenes are visually stunning, accompanied by a moving musical score that blends perfectly. The fighting sequences are spectacular, with the finest choreography ever done, yet it is never excessive. Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien, Chow Yun Fat as Li Mui Bai, and newcomer Zhang Ziyi as Jen are all brilliantly cast. Young Jen will simply steal your heart.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon transports us to a time and place where honor, duty, compassion, wisdom and selflessness are the ideals that our heros, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mui Bai live by. In fact, they are so endearing that we want to possess them as well. Virtually every human emotion comes into play here, with performances so effortlessly portrayed that you feel as the main characters feel.
Think of this movie as a wonderful fantasy. As such, you will witness supernatural abilities beyond the realm of mere mortals. (and it will help you to come to an understanding with the main characters ability to defy gravity.)
I believe that subtitles add immensly to Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon. Reading them engages you more deeply into the story. My advice to someone not used to subtitles is to read them quickly. This way you won't get frustrated. After a short time, you will hardly notice them.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is no ordinary movie, it is an experience which comes around only a few times in ones lifetime. If you have not yet seen it and it is available on the big screen where you live, run...don't walk to this incredible work of art.

Despite the (over)hype, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very simply, very easily overrated. Although it has moments that are truly great, these are few and far between. This is hardly the best Martial Arts movie of all time, that's for sure. And I don't know why people are praising the FX. Digitally erasing wires is NOT a great achievement. Director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm) has come up with the least interesting film of his career, though Crouching Tiger IS more entertaining than Ride With The Devil. Based on the (over)reaction to Crouching Tiger, I expected magic. Instead, I got a tedious and pretentious film that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of brilliance. According to my watch, with which I become well acquainted during the screening, I believe that there are about 20 minutes of a great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one.

I knew as soon as I saw this movie nominated for both best foreign film and best picture that it would definitely win best foreign, and fall to gladiator for best picture.  While I enjoyed Gladiator a great deal, it is a crime that CTHD did not win the award it so richly deserved:  Best Picture of the year 2000.  When I first went to see this film, I was among the hordes who were blown away by the stunning cinematography, incredible action choreography and amazing wire work.  Truly a remarkable action film with amazing filming on location.  I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so brilliantly green as the bamboo forest that is but a small location shot in this movie.  The first viewing proved to me that I loved this film, but it did not prove to me that it was the best picture of the year.  That took 2 viewings.  I highly recommend to anyone who has seen this film and enjoyed it that you go see it again.  I found (since I don't speak chinese) that seeing it a second time while already knowing the story allowed me to concentrate less on reading subtitles, and more on the actors and their performances.  It was amazing to me to peel back the layers of the initially strong performances in this film and see the incredible amount of nuance that each of the leads provided in their portrayals.  After seeing it the second time, I had a whole new take on almost every piece of dialog in the film.  The first scene between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh most definitely sets the tone for this film, and contrary to what many would have you believe it is not a tone of rollicking action/adventure.  It is instead a tone of yearning, tragedy and love found too late, then lost.  This movie, packed with stunning fights and amazing flying martial artists is not so much about fighting, as it is about the chinese values of loyalty, honor and duty, and how these admirable values can ultimately keep one from truly being happy.  It is the story of a love denied too long, and accepted too late.  I am not ashamed to say that I wept openly at the end of this film both times that I saw it.  The power of the story and the performances were so strong that I felt a small shadow of the loss that the characters in the film felt, and even this small shadow was enough to make me weep.  For those of you who find nothing but swordfights and blood in this movie, nothing I can say will change your mind; but for those who have an inkling that this film is about much more than fighting and bloodshed, go see it again and buy it when it is released on DVD.

1137680,4,7883631101,"This movie sure takes some getting used to. First off, it's ""foreign-language"" - I'm not American but the only thing around are American movies. Then it is set in such a faraway world - ancient China, quite hard to relate to. Just as an example, it will be hard for average Westerners to tell whether it takes place 200 or 2000 years ago.
The movie itself is an aesthetic treat. The costumes are rich. The decors are superb - though a little overdone in color and sheer richness (I'm sure ancient China didn't look that... Chinese), they greatly contribute to the atmosphere. So does the music.
Many people talked about the matrial arts, and that is the least debatable thing in the movie. The fights are breathtaking, and there is an incredible realism in them. I think this is a huge feat: making such impossible movements seem perfectly natural. You'll enderstand when you see the characters glide across rooftops and up walls. For me, the culminating scene was the treetop fight, perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes, surely the most amazing fight sequence I have ever seen.
Now to the human part. I think the relationship between Li Mu Bai and the other fighter (sorry, their names are so hard to remember...) is quite well developped. The romantic part is not very believable, buit nonetheless enjoyable.
This movie is an exercise in poetry on film. It's an ode to art, beauty, culture and love. So don't expect a movie that will tell you a conventional story. It's not like it doesn't have a plot, but it's not a story as you would get from average Hollywood. If you take it as that, you will be disoriented by the lack of anything anchored in reality.

1137834,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
Score: 98/100
Not been a big fan of martial arts movies, I was pleasantly surprised by Ang Lee's gorgeous 2000 release, which is able to mix thrills, action, adventure, romance and dramatic events into an acceptable running time. This universally acclaimed masterpiece has only been released a month or so, and already, it has become a cinema landmark.
Set in a mythical China of the early 19th century, a romantic epic is spun about the theft of an ancient sword known as Green Destiny. The owner, renowned warrior Li Mui Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), and female fighter, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), discover the culprit is a young aristocrat, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), whose martial arts skills are unprecedented. As the older warriors attempt to tame this wild spirit, it becomes clear she is also under the influence of an evil force.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the kind of cinema experience that only comes along once in a lifetime and leaves you gasping for air. You can even tell this is going to be a masterful film by watching the opening credits, and you're heart will be racing during all the fight scenes and all the scenes of emotional depth in the film. Ang Lee's direction effort is quite simply amazing, he controls his cast and crew perfectly, and his powerful punch to the film definitely should earn him the Golden Globe he has got, and the Oscar he better get. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh must be credited for their awesome performances, and long-haired romantic touch Chang Cheng has a personality off-screen and on-screen that makes you love him and his character more and more each time he swash-buckles onto the screen. But, clearly the real talent here lies with Zhang Ziyi as the stunning Jen. She gives quite possibly the most convincing non-English performance since Franka Potente in Run Lola Run, and gives a role that will live forever in my memory.
By far the best film of 2000, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a heart-pounding adventure, that will surely become a classic in years to come.",985392000,15,2048,4.8210227272727275

If you took out the Martial arts, would it be great...Yes!  You see there are so many truely masterful facets to this move, that removing one aspect doesn't even phase it.

CTHD is perhaps a fine definition of the term 'epic'. Count 'em: two love stories, both somewhat forbidden, several huge landscapes, characters with dignity, poise, and adult motivations, and enough eye-popping fight scenes to shake a Green Destiny at. For me, at least, it's the kind of film that leaves you staggering out of the cinema, with your faith in the direction of modern film-making at least somewhat revived. In an era of cheesy TV series remakes, pointless big-bidget action sequels and formulaic big-name romantic comedies, there are at least some films which can feel fresh, young, and honest.

If for no other reason, CTHD is worth seeing for the scenery alone.  It is the most breathtakingly beautiful movie I have ever seen.  It even surpasses the flamingo scene from 'Out of Africa'.  The musical score meshes perfectly with every scene, my particular favorite being the drum sequence during the first fight between Shu Lien and Jen in the Forbidden City.  And then there is the fighting itself, which is so much more artistic in nature than the mere brawling styles of Segal or Van Damme, that one finds themselves entranced.
Many people have been comparing CTHD to 'The Matrix', which is fine as far as the comparison goes,  but that doesn't come close to capturing the whole picture.  This film has the physical intensity of The Matrix but with the dexterity and gracefulness of a ballet, the cinemagraphics of Lawrence of Arabia, the subtlety of Hamlet, and the intrigue of King Lear, all wrapped up in a fantasy of romance and adventure.
Yet evidently the film did not do as well in Hong Kong as it did in the U.S.  The reason, at least according to the papers, is that there was not enough martial arts violence to appease the Hong Kong crowd and that flying through a bamboo forest was too unrealistic.  As opposed to realistic films such as Superman?  Indiana Jones?  Star Trek?  CTHD is an elegant fantasy, not some one dimensional John Woo action flick with big explosions for people with attention deficit disorder.  You have to read subtitles (if you don't speak Mandarin), and you have to think, and you have to follow the intertwining lives of four different characters, all of whom give masterful performances and none of which drown out the performances of the others.
Heroism, honor, discipline, faithfulness, as well as treachery, guilt, regret, and sorrow, character traits that are so often missing from the shallow plots and cookie cutter roles that Hollywood so often churns out, are in abundance in this film.  Shu Lien, Li Mu Bai, Jen, and Lo are more real, that is say more believable as true personalities, than any of the characters in the more ""realistic"" martial arts films that the people of Hong Kong seem to prefer.
I am a big fan of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and the Hong Kong action genre (John Woo notwithstanding), but this is not that kind of film and should not be compared to that style.

1137838,2,7883631101,"With as much praise as this film is getting, any detractors will be accused of 'sour grapes'. But people are making this film out something it isn't -- A serious artistic work. Sure, the productions values are great for this type of film, the acting is sincere, and the soundtrack is beautiful, but the film should have been alot more fun than it actually was. After all, Ang Lee's film takes place in a 'mythical' China. To summarize the complicated story briefly: two warriors, one male (Li Mu Bai, played by Chow Yun Fat, one of the biggest stars in the world) and one female (Yu Shu Lien), have had a long friendship, although they have suppressed their desires for one another out of respect for her dead fianc. Li is having second thoughts about his life. A young woman (Jen) comes into their lives who has immense talent as a fighter, but is rebellious and troublesome and keeps company with Li's old enemy, Jade Fox. Jen has an old love (Lo), a bandit, who shows up unexpectedly.
One battle or trial follows the other. The various combatants fight on rooftops, in treetops and on water. Some of the effects are impressive, much of it is cheezy. Along the way, Li in particular walks around pompously distributing bits of Taoist wisdom. The director Ang Lee describes it thusly: ""The internal strength, which in essence is searching for nothingness, the void, to find your strength.... If you can lose all the tension and direct all your energy to one channel, you create tremendous power and wisdom."" Oh please....this is the kind of stuff one can find in the average self-help guide. The astonishing thing about this film, set in ""feudal China"", is the thoroughgoing absence of social commentary or protest. Certainly that was a common feature in Kurosawa's samurai films, for example. Even in the cheezy martial arts film one comes across on late-night television the hero is often defending oppressed villagers or opposing some evil lord or other. Not in Ang Lee's film. The subject matter is borrowed from every trivial, self-absorbed story of the middle class in recent years: a girl struggles with her identity amidst a world of pressures and temptations. The lower classes are kept properly in the background.
And then there are reviewers who say that because the women are given equal opportunity (or more) to perform as fighters, that Crouching Tiger makes an ""important feminist statement."" Yeah, right, as if those weren't a dime a dozen. Females of the upper classes have lots of defenders. After all, there are women studio executives making millions of dollars and stupid movies just like the men. What a step forward for humanity! Who speaks for the poor and the oppressed in contemporary filmmaking? This is the Ang Lee's own self-important description of the film: ""Some may have thought it strange that I could just drop what I normally do and make something like a B-movie. And as I was doing it, there was no escape, I had to bring in drama, I had to bring in women, I had to bring beauty and whatever I felt added quality to it. It became an Ang Lee movie."" And what precisely is that you may ask? A rather amorphous liberal sensibility, combined with a certain technical skill. I find his work insipid. A devotion to the fate of humanity, which one sticks to under all circumstances, is a precondition in our day for serious artistic work. This is NOT what we find here.",985046400,16,3400,4.735244519392918

1137840,5,7883631101,"Up until 4 months ago, i had no idea who Ang Lee was, or the kind of film that was about to be unleashed.  All I knew was that the critics had liked it.  Having taken their word and seen ""Dancer in the Dark"" & ""Billy Elliot,"" I saw CTHD, and the film was even better than i had expected.  Up until the viewing, everyone kept commenting on the martial arts, but what is even greater is this: the martial arts only serve as a small piece of the entire story puzzle.
  Our story starts with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat, very much like Obi-Wan Kenobi), and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  Both of these warriors harbor secret feelings for the other, but are in such a trivial point as to not divulge them.  Li Mu Bai has decided to give up his sword, the legendary ""Green Destiny.""  Upon delivering it to one of Mu Bai's friends, Shu Lien meets young Jen Yu(the beautiful Zhang Ziyi).  About to be married off by her parents, the young girl tells Shu Lien of her longings to live such as the warriors she read of in books, instead of being married off to improve her parent's status.
  Then, over the course of several days, the ""Green Destiny"" disappears, and it is found that a rather nimble figure is causing panic throughout the courtyards.  Shu Lien confronts the stranger, in one of the first major ground battles, as they fly over walls, do twirls in midair, and engage in foot and handwork unlike anything many of us have ever seen.
  Eventually, we are then thrust into the story from Jen Yu's point of view, as we learn her governess is the corrupted Jade Fox, who killed Li Mu Bai's master, and has been trying to train Jen in the ways of martial arts (little does Jade Fox know of Jen's power).  We then learn of a secret romance shared by Jen and a desert bandit named Lo(Chang Chen), which seems much more free than the constrained feelings of Li Mu Bai & Shu Lien.
  The entire style of the film is worthy of the Academy's 10 nominations.  Ang Lee gives us such impressive camerawork that we believe that this story is more fictional than real (when you first see the characters fly through the air, do not dismiss it as ridiculous.  It is simply fantasy).  China never looked so beautiful, even in the earthen colors of the landscapes.  The editing and cinematography capture the beautiful green hills as the rain sets in, as well as the vastness of the desert along China's Western Border.
  But what most people will be commenting on will be the sequences that were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping.  Using the tricks of dance and martial arts, these people are more graceful and skilled than anything that most people have ever seen.  The choreography is also as good as the music, with the decidedly eastern flair brought upon by Tan Dun.  Using more traditional instruments instead of synthesizers and high-pitched brass, the music helps us understand the story in some of the most vague areas of plot.
  This review was written a week before the Academy Awards. Hopefully, it will receive some wonderful honors towards the picture, and it can show that films do not need to be about major budgets, but can also create beauty out of image and sound, as well as pure emotion.",984960000,15,3179,4.481739130434782

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does pay a homage to this older films because it borrows many ideas from these films. What Crouching Tiger did is it balances the script with action and melodrama instead of weighing more on the action. Crouching Tiger is more operatic than these earlier films because of the poetic like dialogues. There was never a moment in the movie that was boring. Everything has its purpose and director Ang Lee did a wonderful job on creating an atmosphere where everything seems magical.  Many people said that there were too many flying scenes and it's not real. Of course it's not real. I don't understand why people can accept The Force in Star Wars, but cannot accept flying. These are mythical characters and they are larger than life. This movie emphasizes on many philosophical ideas and if you do not understand, don't criticize it. I personally think this is the best wuxia movie to come out in a long time.

1137842,5,7883631101,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is Lee Ang's one of the most visionary and laudable efforts since Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility. The movie boasts an well-ensembled cast with sublime performances especially from the feisty Jen (Zhang Ziyi) and the subtle, mellow Mu Bai (Chow Yuen Fatt). It is an epic of swordsplay in virtuoso and the bitter legendary world where honor collides with passion, obligations and trust. At first glance, it is not difficult to notice its prime attractions - beautiful cinematography from the award-winning Peter Pau and the energetic and sleek martial arts movements supervised by Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix). However, it defies categorisation of the Wuxia fable to reach deep and dissect each character's emotional trauma and restraint. Michelle Yeoh is casted as Yu Shu Lien, a dignified swordswoman whose destiny criss-crossed with the infamous ""Green Destiny"". There she joins forces with Li to find the sword - only to be obstructed by Jen, who aims for power in the Wuxia world.
Lee Ang's adaptation of the fable by Wang Du Lu focuses distinctly on the character's development. Jen is trapped by the betrayal of her mentor and her duties to her family; the dramatic tragedy of unrequited romance between Li and Yu - their fates are intertwined by the sword which is the centrestage of the movie. It is at once a human drama tinged with bittersweet regrets for the warring hearts. Enhanced by the poetry of the cinematography and the enchanting score by Tao Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can probably roar and spear ahead in the race for Oscar. It is unequivocally the most refreshing piece of work this year.",984787200,12,1652,4.9675090252707585
1137843,5,7883631101,"Many people label 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as a martial arts movie. It is not. Director Ang Lee (the man responsible for such sweeping dramatic films as 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'The Ice Storm') has crafted a moving love story set against mythic lore. The numerous fight scenes are not the basis or definition of this film. The exist because they are within the story, not because they are the story. Lee has always paid fine attention to characters and this is no exception. There are two tales of forbidden love (one through profession, the other through status) and the way it's characters not only reflect but compliment each other is extrodinary. It's actors are startlingly excellent. Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh play two warriors who share feelings for each other, as well as a past hinted at though never explained. They are in love but dare not speak of it to each other. Both are compelling screen presenses who chill and fascinate even when they not speaking a word. Zhang Ziyi plays the delicate governor's daughter who may or may not be more then she appears and Chang Chen is her love, a wild desert pirate who once kidnapped her (their first encounter takes place in a long Sergio Leone style flashback sequence that could serve as a whole film itself). The story involves Li Mu-bai (Yun-fat) who wishes to retire from his warrior ways. In his possession is the sword of the Green Destiny, which he gives to an old friend as a gift. The film kick-starts into high-gear when a thief makes off with the sword, with Yu Shu-lien (Yeoh) in hot pursuit. What follows is pure cinema magic, equal to anything Kurosawa has ever put on the screen. And Lee holds it all together crafting each scene into a masterwork. And what about the fight sequences? They are AMAZING. Characters cling to tree tops, scale walls with the greatest of ease, defy gravity as they leap through the air... all without sacrificing the crucial human and realistic element of the film. Even though they are clearly out of the realm of human ability, we accept them because they are not only very convincingly done but also very fluid and masterfully shot (the scene in which Jen, played by Zhang Ziyi takes on a whole slew of fighters at a saloon could very well be the greatest fight scene ever filmed). 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is an exceptional film that will no doubt be imitated, but it will never be equaled. It is a fantasy film with a human side, a look at pride, love, and honor. And it is the greatest film I have seen in a long, long time. Not only the best film of 2000, but also one of the greatest films ever made.",984614400,20,2632,4.602127659574468

There is a 15 minute interview with lead actres Michelle Yeoh, an extensive gallery of pictures from the making of the movie, a very informative and fun commentary by director Ang Lee and producer/scribe James Schamus.  The menus are animated but it takes slightly too long for them to finish, which can be annoying.

The musical score is among the best for the year and the scenery is breathtaking.
After the first few minutes, reading the subtitles becomes so automatic that you almost forget they are there. For Mandarin speakers, however, get set for rather heavily accented speech from most of the major cast members. Considering that many of the persons in the movie are supposed to be mercenaries, the accents may actually add to the movie's charm.

Which has similar scenes to Hidden Dragon such as anti gravity jumps over roof tops.  Even though Matrix and Hidden Dragon had the same fight scene coordinator, the difference is that Matrix used computer genrated special effects, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only used ropes and man power.  The reason why people in the US hasn't seen fighting scenes like these is because they will get confused.  They wouldn't understand why people are flying or what makes them fly.  Americans believe that the only reason a person could fly is if he had special powers like Superman or the person is not human or the person has some kind of fairy dust.

I have seen the movie several times and every time I am excided to go and see it again. All of the Charatures are very well developed. You get pulled into the scenes. The fight scenes grab your attention and keep them they are not you typical scene, two or three seconds and a camera switch. The camera stayed rolling some time for several mins. keeping tha action moving. It say alot for the actors that they ar talented enough to do those scens with few breaks in them.
I would have like to have seen the movie in english but once you get used to reading the subtitles it is easy going. The only Draw back is the subtitles nmore than likely are not telling everything that is said. Alot can be lost in translation.

1138092,5,7883631101,"CTHD is probably the best movie I've ever seen. This is one of those movies that truly grabs you're heart. After walking out of that theater, I already committed myself on seeing it again. This movie contains so much symbolism and I believe it takes more than viewing it once to appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece. I must admit I never felt this way about a movie before. To me, it feels like any other movie that I will watch in the future after seeing CTHD will totally ... (hehe). Everything in the movie was just perfect; superb cinematography, magnificent choreography, well casted, awesome soundtrack (I wanted to cry after hearing the song played at the end), breathtaking scenery, a great director (Ang Lee), and a well-written plot. Basically a wonderful love/romance/trust/betrayal/justice/revenge foreign film.
I overheard some of my classmate's comments on CTHD. Some believe that the subtitles were boring, hard to watch, a hassle to read and made the movie stupid. Well this is what I had to say for them. ""First of all, how slow do you read? I mean they tried to keep the sentences to 1 or 2 so it's easy for people to read, and they also show the subtitle ahead of time. If CTHD was dubbed in English, well that would just ruin the movie. I really think it was a good idea to keep the movie in Mandarin to keep its uniqueness. Wouldn't the movie look like one of those old Chinese movies where they talk and the words come out a minute later? If the movie was also dubbed, the actor's tone of voice and expressions of the words will change, and will lose their significance in the movie. The subtitles were poetry themselves, and some words in Mandarin can't be accurately translated in English. For example, a word in Mandarin can sound so engaging, while in English it's just like an ordinary word"".
Many may also believe that the ""flying"" was so unrealistic and the fighting scenes were so stupid that people laughed. Well how about X-Men, Superman, Batman, Matrix, they didn't complain about the flying on those movie did they? All of these Hollywood movies are fantasies and we accept that. But why is it when Chinese makes their version of a fantasy movie (that includes flying) people criticize it? I believe these people should open up their selves to seeing idea from different culture. Because this movie is not from ""Hollywood"", you can't assume that it's stupid. I've read that audience from some theater laughed at the fighting scenes. I have no idea why, but my only conclusion is that they probably haven't been exposed to any sort of martial arts, and they probably think that those fighting scenes were a chicken dance. The fighting choreography in this movie is superb. I've seen so many martial arts movie, but not as superior as this one.
This movie is so good and was definitely worth every bit of the 7 bucks that I paid, and perhaps another 7 bucks for another viewing. It only happens once in a great while, where a movie can just grab you and just won't let you go, and CTHD can absolutely do that.

A high budget martial arts film playing in theaters actually in Mandarian sounded amazing to me, and it actually greatly surpassed my expectations.
First off, CTHD is a very good film in itself.  The look of the battles, background, and the plot aren't revolutionary in comparison to older martial arts Hong Kong cinema, but the fact that the production value was extremely high and that this film was being shown subtitled in the cinema really got me.  Add in my bias for Chow Yun-Fat (I have never seen a good film with him speaking English, this was good and it was neither English or Cantonese so I'm seeing for the first time in a good film that's not in Cantonese), and I have a very good experience seeing this movie in the theater.  I've had a terrible run of films for the past year.  Theaters have been so dry, I've been watched terrible films like Valentine, the Watcher, etc, but this film tops Hannibal as the best film I've seen in the theater for quite a while.  If you haven't seen a lot of martial arts films, I truthfully urge you to go see this in the theater quickly, if you don't enjoy it I don't like you anyway.  If you've been there done that with M.Arts movies and this movie doesn't look appealing you might want to skip it.  Regardless, I really hope the film has an extrodinary impact on American movie goers (but not too much).  If the right balance is acheived with its popularity we may be able to look forward to some high quality DVD and theatrical releases.
The fact that its a theatrical subtitle release that's 100% class blows my mind.  I personally think its a epic-classic-type martial arts film with beautiful things to look at throughout the majority of the picture (beginning is sort of slow).  I really enjoyed the duration of the entire film and will definetely add it to my collection when the DVD is released.
