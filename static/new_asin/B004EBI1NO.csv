8426610,5,B004EBI1NO,Our favorite Jesus story. We have watched many. This is mine & my oldest sons favorite. I would say we love it over The Passion (Mel Gibson's version) But his was just different. I'm not sure you can compare his to anyone else's. I recommend this movie & would definitely buy again.,1511136000,,282,4.4423076923076925
