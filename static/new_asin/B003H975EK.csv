8396932,3,B003H975EK,i loved the dance performances by the dance group and by Silvana Mangano.  Silvana and Vittorio Gassman were disappointing actors in this movie - unlike in Bitter Rice.  At least Shelley Winters was good.  I did not like the fact that the film beginning credits were superimposed on some very fine dancing - it was disconcerting and annoying.,1359331200,,342,4.862068965517241
8396933,4,B003H975EK,"Returning to her hometown of Venice, a famous dancer (Silvana Mangano) reflects on the two men who lead to her leave Venice and now make her uncomfortable in returning. One (Vittorio Gassman) was a good for nothing opportunist and the other (Michael Rennie), a debauched aristocrat. As she suspected, both men re-enter her life but for different reasons. An Italian-American co-production, the film was produced by Dino De Laurentis (Mangano's husband) and Carlo Ponti from an original script by three Italian screenwriters and the film's American director, Robert Rossen (THE HUSTLER). It's a rather kitschy soap opera with Mangano suffering in poverty, suffering in wealth and well, just suffering. The best sections of the film involve the dance sequences which were choreographed by the great Katherine Dunham, who plays herself in the film. Unfortunately, as lovely as she is, Mangano lacks a dancer's grace and her dancing is awkward when in the presence of real dancers. As the manager of the almost all black dance troupe, Shelley Winters has some nice scenes before being dispatched way too soon, taking some of the film's life with her. I suppose the decision to shoot the film in black and white, Harold Rosson (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN) did the cinematography, might have been an attempt to give the film a grittier look but the Rome and Venice locations scream out for color. The score is by Nino Rota and Angelo Francesco Lavagnino. With Eduardo Ciannelli and Julie Robinson (Mrs. Harry Belafonte).

The transfer of the print used by PR Studios and being sold by Amazon has seen better days but is still quite watchable.",1335052800,4,1629,5.011070110701107
8396934,1,B003H975EK,"Although the movie, ""Mambo"" was s good movie in its day, the reproduction to DVD is of very poor quality for the price I had to pay for it.  I've always purchased my movies from Amazon because they seemed to have better picture-quality, but here lately, I've received some bummers. One was a Terry Moore/Debra Paget movie - ""Why Must I die,""; another was ""Queen of the Nile"";then ""San Francisco Story""; and ""Cleopatra's Daughter."" The picture-quality on all thse movies is horrible.

On another note, ""And God Created Woman,"" the picture is fantastic but you can't enjoy it because it is not in English and you have to constantly read in order to understand what they are saying.  The film was way too expensive.  Years ago I purchased a VHS tape of it in a bargain bin at a Video store for $1.00 and it was in English, but the picture was horrible.",1287619200,2,849,4.529411764705882
