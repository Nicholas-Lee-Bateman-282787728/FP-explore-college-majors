8228676,3,B000XJF3SW,"I generally enjoy watching the video accounts of the Giro produced by WCP from the original footage provided by RCS, the Giro organizer in conjunction with RAI the broadcaster.  Excellent scenery, close up action shots and wonderful ambient sounds from the event.  What I don't like so much is the audio commentary. Liggett and Sherwen (unlike LeTour) rarely, if ever actually go to Italy and see the race, instead dubbing the audio in, either watching the race on live TV or later watching the compiled footage. Their commentary is old and trite for the most part and it's tough to listen to them pontificate on who will win the stage you're watching when you suspect they already know who won.  I wish WCP would offer these DVD's with a separate audio track selection like a language selection on many DVD's.  A ""standard"" setting with Phil and Paul plus another with ONLY the ambient sound as supplied by RCS/RAI.  Some better editing would help on the video side, sometimes it seems as though the editor started out trying to cram in as much of each stage as possible but wasted precious time on some rather boring stages, then ended up cutting more out of the interesting stages which came later to end up within the time limit/space available.",1249084800,2,1249,4.7373271889400925
