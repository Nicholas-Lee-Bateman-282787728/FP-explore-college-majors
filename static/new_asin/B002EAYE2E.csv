8367302,1,B002EAYE2E,I did not care at all for this version.  It appears to have been made to give Roddy pocket money.,1304121600,,97,3.85
8367303,5,B002EAYE2E,"The story is well-told at a good pace; carrying you along. A lot of filming outdoors. Well cast with likeable good-guys and hateable bad-guys. The pretty, Sue England, who plays the innkeeper's daughter, sounds like Shirley Temple. They could be sisters. I have seen the Disney version and liked that too. This version, in black & white, has the better story, but the Disney version, in color, does some other things better. I liked them both. The 1995-version got good reviews too, and is twice as long.

The Scots resent the heavy taxes of the British, and certain, corrupt tax-collectors. The Scottish wife says, ""The British took all our money, our only cow, and the children have not a drop of milk to drink.""

This DVD-R played fine on my laptop-computer.",1298851200,3,761,4.801526717557252
8367304,4,B002EAYE2E,This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with its anticipated action.  It is a very good movie adaptation of Kidnapped.  Buyer beware!  Warner has issued this movie on a DVD-R.  There is no excuse for this regression.,1270339200,5,222,4.475
