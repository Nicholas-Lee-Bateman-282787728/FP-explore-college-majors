1644433,4,B00005Q4DZ,"I bought this DVD because Kirsten Dunst is in it. And I never regret it!
This movie is beautiful, but maybe not for everybody. It doesn't have the factors to make it big in the box office.
There are 2 reasons why I put 4 stars instead of 5:
1. The ending is not nicely done.
2. The movie is presented in full screen format.",1014163200,3,323,3.9846153846153847
1644434,5,B00005Q4DZ,"""I'll start at the beginning, as all stories must...""
- Celia (Lynn Redgrave)

A good story has the power to heal and if you have seen The Secret of Roan Inish, you will enjoy this story even more. You are immediately drawn into this haunting tale by a rather moody Claire Mackay (Julia Brendler), a grieving teenage violinist who seems uninterested in living in an isolated island community off the coast of Nova Scotia.

She and her mother (Alberta Watson)  arrive on the island and Claire is given a package to deliver, which she forgets at the beach. After a fight with her mother, she finds an emotional release in swimming as far as she can into the water's salty soul. The viewer might assume she has drowned as I did, but suddenly we find her washed up on the beach with the small package floating in the edges of the foamy surf at her bare feet.

Claire's brooding moods almost border on depression at first until she finds Celia (Lynn Redgrave), the owner of the package. We soon find out this is a story Celia is writing has been rejected by the publishers. As she hangs the dripping pages up to dry on the clothesline, Claire becomes rather interested in the story.

Two stories then start to intertwine like seaweed waving on the floor of the ocean. Claire and Silly's lives have so many similarities. They are almost mirrors to one another's souls. Celia knows that her story was just waiting for Claire to discover it.

Silly (Kirsten Dunst) is the girl in Celia's story who is born at the beginning of the fishing season on a cursed island, she has a strange affinity to the call of the sea. As she swims in the ocean as a very young child, her eyes change color and this startles her mother. No one in the fishing village will tell her about the ancient legend of a Viking ship that passed by so long ago and was shipwrecked near the island.

The island is cursed and every 50 years the fish dissapear and someone drowns to break the curse. Everyone on the island believes that the sea has come to take that individual as a sacrifice. While this part of the story seems pretty intense, it is played out rather mildly in the film.

This is also a love story where two people find one another quite by chance.  James (Trent Ford), the son of a wealthy British Admiral is drawn to the island and falls in love with Silly. He spends most of his time camped out in a tent on the beach where they meet occasionally. James and Silly share moments of happiness, but sadly make the mistake of taking destiny in their own hands and run into a storm they cannot control.

If you love the sound of the ocean, the feel of sand between your toes and a salty breeze tousling your hair, this movie will take you there.

Lingering memories melt with myth to capture the
essence of beauty you expect from a fairy tale.

1644435,5,B00005Q4DZ,"I have watched this movie a MILLION times already!  I love this film!  It is the first for Director Sheri Elwood of Bellwood Stories, and she and her partner have done a great JOB!  The story itself is so sweet, yet tragic...  Kirsten Dunst does a great job palying the lead role of a young woman who falls in love for the first time.  And once there love is threatend, the two find a way to be together anyways.  This story is dramatic, ghostly and above all, LOVELY!  A must see for Kirsten Dunst fans.  The movie is worth watching it just for the BEAUTIFUL SCORE by Micki Mueser.  Which I hear (and I hope it's true) is soon to be released to the public!  Oh how I can't wait!  The movie flips from present time to the past, and is about the loss of loved ones, and how a SIMPLE story can releive the hurt.  Trent Ford is a newcomer to films, and he is FANTASTIC!  Soon to be in ""Gosford Park,"" and ""Slap Her, She's French.""  He shows extreme emotion, and plays a heartfelt character.  WATCH THIS - YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!",1012348800,11,1024,4.17948717948718
1644436,4,B00005Q4DZ,"The only reason I watched this is because Kirsten is in it and I love her. It's a good movie with a nice story line. But it's very unoriginal. Like it's trying to be Titanic. The 3 main comparisons:
  1:Grandma tells story of when she was young
  2:Tragedy at sea
  3:The scene when James drowns, at the end, is the same as when Jack drowns
Kirsten disappoints her fans with being unoriginal.",1011916800,2,392,4.375
1644437,2,B00005Q4DZ,This movie was horrible.  Kirsten Dunst is my favorite actor and I just had to see it.  Well now I know why it did not make it to theatres.

1644438,3,B00005Q4DZ,"After recently watching the movie Deeply, I can tell you that this movie is extremly predictable. I kept trying to see what it was rated, but the movie was 'un-rated'.  As a guide, I would say anybody over the age of 13 should be okay with this movie.  I hope this review helps you!
P.S.- This is not a good movie if you are looking for a comedy, drama, or romance(well, maybe a little).  Also, I think I would watch this movie again if given the opportunity.",1009670400,,459,4.252873563218391
1644489,4,B00005Q4DZ,"_Deeply_ is a beautifully filmed if rather somber movie, ostensibly a fantasy story but with the magical elements very subtle. Really it is two stories. One is a framing modern day story, perhaps not unlike say _The Princess Bride_, though this plotline is much more serious. It focuses on a teenager who had undergone some sort of trauma while at school in Europe, a trauma only hinted at and not revealed until much later in the film. Brought to an island community (never named), one that used to thrive on fishing but is now largely uninhabited, this teenager, Claire McKay, has moved into a house with her mother and her uncle. Not only not wanting to be on the very isolated island (there is only one boat on the island and it is frequently in use), Claire doesn't want to talk to her mother or her uncle and just wants to grieve. Her mom and her uncle think they are doing the right thing by bringing her to the island, but Claire doesn't seem to think so at all.

 She becomes, after a time, friends with an eccentric next neighbor, a near elderly woman by the name of Celia (played by Lynn Redgrave). Celia engaged Claire's interest by reading a story she had been writing, one that would appear to have had no ending until Claire showed up, a tragic tale set on the same island in the 1940s, one involving another teenager, a woman by the name of Silly (played by Kirsten Dunst).

 The fantasy elements revolve around the founding myth of the island, that the first would-be settlers were Vikings, and one Viking couple, a man and a woman, the woman pregnant with the couple's child, perished in a storm before they could reach the island's shores. Just before they perished beneath the sea, they cursed the island, the curse being that every 50 years the fish would dry up unless a chosen one, apparently a young woman, sacrificed herself. Was Silly that chosen one that story seems to ask? Was the curse real? Is that her destiny?

 The viewer never is sure if that is curse is real or not, as while the islanders take it seriously, outsiders do not, and there are little obvious magical elements except on two occasions (and even those occasions are open to interpretation).

 Really for me the movie is about accepting the loss of loved ones, of moving on, perhaps dealing with survivor's guilt. The story-within-the-story, starring Ms. Dunst is a romance, at times funny, but without giving too much away is ultimately tragic.

 I found the movie a bit somber at times, moody, many scenes of quiet people contemplating the sea while the waves crashed on the shore and orchestral music could be heard in the background or for the story of Silly, much of that revolved around a rebellious teenager (echoing the quieter rebellions of the grieving Claire in the present). Sometimes I found the pace a bit slow but I thought it well made. The scenery was beautiful, Ms. Dunst is a good actress, and I generally liked it.",1224720000,5,2930,4.606525911708253

1644497,3,B00005Q4DZ,"What could have been a truly touching drama becomes tiresome at times.  When a young girl is taken to a cursed, remote island by her mom, she comes to learn about the history of this place.  She's told of Kirsten, who plays a special girl called Silly, who holds the secret of lifting a curse which plagues the island every 50 years.  Only problem is, all the townsfolk seem to know this secret, except of course Miss Silly.  Uhmm . . . I wonder how she got that silly name?  You'd think by the time you're 16 years old, you'd have done just about everything to everyone to get some answers and come out of the dark.  Nooo, not Miss Silly.  She pouts and screams and stamps her foot, to no avail.
Although I managed to shed some tears in the final sequences, the preceding scenes are so drawn out, that the viewer can't help but feel that the director is purposely trying to torture us into thinking that there is an extremely blinding light at the end of the tunnel.  But at the end of the day, all we get is a light no brighter than all the rest.

1644508,2,B00005Q4DZ,"Found this in a bargain bin.  I see quite a few movies a year and never heard of it.  Now that I've seen it, I know why.  It's a mess.  Either the director or editor made a mess of what could have been a good film.  Very obviously influenced by James Cameron's ""Titanic"", the direction leaves you wondering several times why did we get to this next scene? What just happened?  Why did that character do that?  Some of the dissolves were messy as well.  I bought it because I think that Kirsten Dunst and Lynn Redgrave are two brilliant actresses, but unfortunately because of the storyline, never get to act with each other.  The under story was the biggest mess with the character's mom and boyfriend almost afterthoughts.  It could have been better.",1063584000,5,751,4.537313432835821

I rented it a while back and saw it once with a friend.  It isn't for everyone, that I will admit, but if you like the artistic movie that really makes you think.  This is one to get.  The music is wonderfully composed, and relates so well with the picture that it is...harmonious.  I would recomend this movie to anyone who is interested in more than just a shoot-em-up movie.  Who is looking for a beautifully written drama that will grab their attention.",1052611200,6,581,4.383177570093458
1644511,5,B00005Q4DZ,"... The synopsis on the back intrigues me because I love this type of storyline that blends reality and fantasy. I find similar qualities in the stories of Neil Gaiman. It reminded me of The Secret of Roan Inish, which is another film I highly recommend. Kirsten Dunst was not my favourite character, though she got most of the screen time. I really liked the actress who played Claire. She doesn't say much, but she wordlessly communicates her characters's feelings in a powerful way.",1051228800,2,485,4.785714285714286
1644512,4,B00005Q4DZ,"If you are looking for an action adventure or a romantic comedy, this isn't the right movie for you. However, if you have ever loved and lost, or if you can empathize with a well-told tale of star-crossed lovers set on a mystical, haunted island experiencing the woes of the modern Newfoundland-Nova Scotia fishery-- you've gotta have this one on DVD. While not anywhere near on the same technical level as Titanic, The Shipping News or The Perfect Storm, Deeply's more innocent, yet darkly foreboding story harkens back to the lost art of storytelling, and in my opinion, exceeds its lookalike big-budget Hollywood blockbusters in eliciting catharsis.
Some reviewers claim they cannot suspend belief long enough to buy into the mystery and superstitions surrounding the disappearance of the fish attributed to a Viking curse. However, they need not suspend belief as I can assure you the once abundant fish really have all but disappeared from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The tales of Viking curses have always been floating around, but they began increasing in popularity since the millennial anniversary of Leif Eiriksson's landfall near L'Anse Aux Meadows held in the summer of 2000.
Those who claim the story and its presentation as a Shakespearian ""play within a play"" is unoriginal are not entirely wrong, but they simply fail to appreciate that all good faerie-tales are unoriginal-- the point is not the freshness of the tale but of its telling. The result of focusing on a masterful telling of a familiar story ensures that this movie will be worth watching over and over again. Perhaps there are fewer surprises than in Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, yet many people never get tired of watching such classics. Anyone deep enough to appreciate Grimm's faerie tales and Shakespeare's plays (more than once) won't mind that they are instantly familiar with Deeply's storyline and its strong parallels to similar stories like James Cameron's Titanic.
The critics who complain about Kirsten Dunst's failed attempt to stretch beyond her talent make a legitimate point. The director should have noticed that Dunst was failing to meld with the culture enough to adequately adopt her character's accent and mannerisms. There was an obvious out-- Silly's mother was the only educated mainlander in town, so it would have been believable to allow Dunst to use her natural accent instead of butchering the maritime lilt into a goofy mix of Ozark hillbilly and Texas drawl. The writer-director must have decided that Silly's backwater accent, incongruous or not, provided a crucial cultural contrast to the refined British accent of other characters. Yet, in spite of the distractions, Dunst captures Silly's spirit in a way few other young actresses can, and delivers a far more powerful performance than did Kate Winslett and Julianne Moore in their counterpart roles.
All the other actors delivered splendid performances, naturally outshined by Lynn Redgrave as Celia, who had little screen time, but nonetheless nailed the local accent and mannerisms in unfortunately stark contrast to Dunst's Silly. However, I believe that anyone who emotionally tunes into the movie early on will not only ignore its faults, but want to see it again and again on DVD.
The modern celtic soundtrack too rarely employs folk music for atmosphere-- the lone Irish dance is beautiful, but it seems the movie missed a rare opportunity to employ well-performed Canadian folk songs like ""I'se the B'y"", ""Feller from Fortune"", ""As I Roved Out"", ""Dark-Eyed Sailor"", ""The Crosshanded Way"", ""She's Like the Swallow"" or any of a whole host of local ballads, jigs and reels that would have perfectly complemented the movie's timeless historical sub-plot. The soundtrack isn't bad, but like the movie's plot, it is a blend of Titanic and The Shipping News, and as such doesn't stand out like it could have.
I rent three or four DVDs a week, but have only seen fit to purchase The Princess Bride, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Shipping News and several Shakespearean plays. Deeply was an unexpected find, but it is definitely next in line on my DVD wish list. Anyone else who appreciates the lost art of storytelling will probably love this movie, especially if they think the plots of the Titanic, The Shipping News and The Perfect Storm were a little too extreme.",1032307200,5,4375,5.086230876216968
1644513,3,B00005Q4DZ,"Deeply is the story of a teenager (Claire) and her mom, who travels to a remote Island off the coast of Nova Scotia, determined to put the past behind them.
Claire, emotionally scarred from a tragic accident, immerses herself in folklore and befriends an elderly woman who writes fairytales.
The woman starts telling Claire of her latest yarn, a story about a young woman named Seelie, and the Viking curse, which has befallen the island.
Through the course of her story, Claire comes to identify with Seelie and finds emotionally healing for herself.
I watched this story because of the premise (I love anything Viking) and was somewhat disappointed. I failed to connect with any of the lead characters, the plot seemed to switch indiscriminately between past and the present, and we never did get to learn more about the ""curse."" or what exactly was ""In the water."" Also, the ending was very poorly done.
Dunst does some decent acting, though, but even she could not save this flick from being anything but average. Worth seeing for some beautiful shots of Nova Scotia, or for those who like obscure ghost stories... For me, I'll pass on a second viewing.",1031443200,3,1157,4.819095477386934
1644514,3,B00005Q4DZ,"A remote fishing village located off the coast of Canada is the setting for this tale of a close-knit community of people who make their living from the sea, while abiding the customs and superstitions that have been handed down from one generation to the next for hundreds of years.  ""Deeply,"" written and directed by Sheri Elwood, is a story of love and survival, and of what it sometimes takes just to get on with life; but more than that, it's about a dark secret that has been a part of this village since before remembrance, and the effects of a collective belief in something few care to contemplate and even fewer dare to speak of openly, even in a contemporary, modern world in which such things no longer exist-- and yet still do.
When her teenage daughter, Claire (Julia Brendler), cannot escape the memories of a tragic accident, Fiona McKay (Alberta Watson) takes her to the island and the village that was her own home as a child.  Fiona hopes the change will enable Claire to put all that has happened behind her.  Claire's depression continues, however, and she becomes increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, even with her mother, who is desperately trying to reach out and help her.
Things begin to change, however, when Claire finds a manuscript on the beach that's been rejected and returned by the publisher, and she delivers it to the owner, a reclusive writer named Celia (Lynn Redgrave), a long time resident of the island who lives alone in a small house at the edge of the sea.  Initially their relationship is tentative, but gradually Claire finds herself drawn to Celia, who agrees to tell Claire the story contained in the manuscript; and it's a story in which Claire finds a parallel to her own life-- and it just may prove to be the catharsis that will enable Claire to move on with her life.
Writer/director Elwood uses the story-within-a-story technique nicely to present her tale, which contains elements that make it something of a cross between ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" and ""The Wicker Man.""  It's beautifully filmed (cinematography by Sebastian Edschmid), and the transitions between the present and the depiction of Celia's story are executed quite well.  The story itself, though, while engaging to a point, is wrapped in a fairly obvious mystery, which in retrospect may have been Elwood's intent, as she creates the dots but leaves it up to the viewer to connect them.  It's effective in that it invites involvement on any number of levels, while leaving it up to the individual to decide upon one and to what extent they want to take it.  Celia's story, which involves a young girl named Silly (Kirsten Dunst) is interesting, but the real appeal of the film is rooted in Claire's gradual awareness of her deep connection to Silly, and how the story subsequently affects her.  And it's in the telling of Claire's story that Elwood's work shines the brightest, as that is where she manages somewhat to connect emotionally with her audience.
One of the best young actors in the business, Kirsten Dunst is to be commended for taking on a role that is quite a departure for her (with the exception of her portrayal of Marion Davies in the more recent ""The Cat's Meow,"" in which she was terrific).  Dunst has a charismatic screen presence and talent to match, which has served her so well in films like ""The Virgin Suicides"" and the aforementioned ""The Cat's Meow,"" and it's obvious that she put a great deal of effort into her portrayal of Silly in this film; and though it's a decent job, she somehow never manages to fully realize the character, and though she has her moments, Silly is never entirely convincing.  Part of the blame has to fall on Elwood, of course, who should have taken measures to correct the most obvious flaw in Dunst's performance, which is the inconsistency of the accent she affects.  Part of the time her manner of speech most resembles Lux Lisbon, while at other times she sounds more like Ma Kettle's daughter.  It is, perhaps, a minor flaw in an otherwise solid performance, but it's enough to prevent Dunst from ""finding"" the character, and it is so distracting that it diminishes the effectiveness of her portrayal, and in turn the credibility of the film.  And there are a couple of scenes in which Silly smokes a pipe that simply do not work at all.  Still, you have to admire Dunst for wanting to expand her repertoire and explore new territory; many actors who have achieved a similar level of success lack the courage to challenge themselves artistically as Dunst has done here, and it's an attribute that will continue to set her apart from the dime-a-dozen actors who flow through the business without making so much as a dent.
As Claire, Julia Brendler gives a performance that is honest and affecting, and as much as the story itself, it's what establishes her as the focus of the film.  She conveys emotions that transcend the typical teen angst, and it makes her situation real and believable.  Her portrayal of Claire is sensitive and (with Elwood's help, of course) is developed with great care, which is what makes it so effective.  The film, in fact, would have benefited had Claire's part been expanded, perhaps with more interaction between her and Celia.  As presented, however, it is definitely the strength of the film.
Lynn Redgrave does a good job as Celia, though she isn't afforded enough screen time to fully develop her character with any nuance; but it is a convincing performance.  Interestingly enough, this was filmed the same year her sister, Vanessa, played a similar role, that of a reclusive old woman living by the sea, in ""A Rumor of Angels.""  A good film, but nothing special, ""Deeply"" is worth a look; just don't expect to be too emotionally engaged by it.",1027382400,,5770,4.761523046092185

7949708,3,B00005Q4DZ,"While I enjoyed the storyline and the setting of this movie, I could not help but be distracted by the variety of accents that where used. I have always admired an actor or actress' ability to fully envelop themselves in the character, including gaining an accurate accent to match the character's origin. To see a splendid example of this listen to Whoopi Goldberg in Clara's Heart. I have a friend who is from Jamaica and Whoopi speaks exactly as my friend does. This no doubt took a great deal of effort on the part of the actress and it adds to the whole flavor of the movie as much as background setting and costumes do!!  Dunst's accent in Deeply is very very Southern United States! I was waiting for her to pop out a ""ya'll"". How did this southern belle come to be born on an island off of Nova Scotia? Dunst's father's character also seems to slip into ""Southern"" accent while many of the others islanders speak varying forms of what would be considered a New England or similar accent. Claire has what seems to be sporting a German accent while her own mother (who grew up an islander, has no Nova Scotia accent but speaks like an American.  (??)  Lynne Redgrave, who is the grown Celia does not have the same accent she had as a teen, also does not have the accent the rest of the islanders do.  (??)
Maybe I should not have been as distracted as I was by this, but to me it would be like filming a scene that was supposed to be in the Caribbean and in the background the viewer sees the Rockies.
The movie is still worthwhile watching, just don't expect 100% authenticity.",1368057600,,1584,4.395904436860068

7949710,5,B00005Q4DZ,"i found this movie years ago in the $5 bin at Walmart one day and i liked alot of movies with Kirsten Dunst and Trent Ford so i decided to purchase this and see how it was since $5 is no big loss if it turned out to be horrible. I was actually quite surprised with the movie. although at times it seems to move slowly, the overall story is quite beautiful yet bittersweet. It's one of those movies for people who love a good love story (despite the fact that its not exactly a ""happy"" love story) It's basically a a story about love that ends in tragedy (think Romeo & Juliet by the sea) I, personally, love this movie. I think its something different and i like how the two stories in one intertwine and the story of Silly's loss in turn helps Claire with her loss and kind of helps in the mending of her broken heart.",1289001600,,819,4.125

The story is very sweet, and just draws you in. You completely forget about the time and just get drawn further and further in, waiting to see what will happen next. Even if you have already seen it!

It's an excellent addition to any story lover's collection.

As for genre, I suppose this is a mystery/romance. The story of ""50 years ago"" is set within a story of ""today."" It's delightfully timeless, which is something I love in any book or movie.",1258675200,,579,4.342592592592593
