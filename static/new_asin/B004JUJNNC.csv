4391142,5,B004JUJNNC,"I absolutely loved the first season and was really looking forward to this prequel, especially to see how some of the other gladiators got to where they were before Spartacus showed up. And I gotta say, I LOVED it! Seeing how Crixus joined the ludus was great, he's definitely one of my favorites. There were plot twists, great new characters and very different characters before we saw them in the first season. This show is awesome, visually amazing, and I love John Hannah and Lucy Lawless. They give wonderful performances of twisted, complex people.

I'm looking forward to season 2, although am saddened with the loss of Andy Whitfield, but am eager to see what they come up with next!",1298851200,7,691,4.758333333333334
4391143,5,B004JUJNNC,"I think we all approached this prequel, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, with great trepidation after watching Blood and Sand. I can tell you GOTA does not disappoint. Episode 1 blasts out of the starting gate with over-the-top action and does not let up until the end credits of episode 6. The mini series answers many questions posed in B&S: What happened to Doctore's wife; how did Battiatus and Solonius come to be at odds with one another; what happened between Crixus and Ashur resulting in Ashur's injury; how did Crixis become Champion of Capua and Lucretia's lover? These questions (and others) are all answered while the writers continue to ramp up the intrigue, action and sex. Outstanding performances by Lawless, Hannah, Murray and Tarabay.

Buy this. You won't be disappointed.",1298764800,18,788,5.015267175572519
4391144,5,B004JUJNNC,"When I first heard about the show I thought it would be interesting, and of course I'm going to watch it because I loved Blood and Sand. However, I didn't expect it to be anything amazing, and certainly nothing near the original Spartacus. I was wrong on both accounts. Not only was it an incredible show, but it rivals the first season in my opinion. One of the main reasons I thought it wouldn't be as good, is the fact that I assumed that because it was a prequel series there would be no surprises. That couldn't be further from the truth. This series provides just as much suspense and surprises as its counterpart. Without giving away the ending, let me just say that it was completely different from what I expected, and far exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this to any fans of Spartacus: Blood and Sand.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand-The-Complete-First-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B003PIUC02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season [Blu-ray</a>]",1298678400,8,1064,5.614906832298137
4391145,5,B004JUJNNC,"Gods of the Arena came about due to the illness of Andy Whitfield (godspeed on a full recovery), so in essence, this isn't part of the Spartacus: Blood and Sand story, but rather a prequel.  The show, is different, and yet the same.

We've still got Quintus and Lucretia (who deserve each other) constantly plotting against all that gets in the way of their devious pursuits of fame and power.  In addition, we get the back story of Oenomaus, Crixus, and Ashur, who play important roles in the Blood and Sand series.

We also get to see the building moral decline of Quintus and Lucretia through their association with Gaia, and the seedy elements she brings to the House of Batiatus.

Spartucus:  Gods of the Arena exceeded my expectations, and was a wild ride well worth watching.

There are plenty of twists and turns that will keep the viewer guessing, and most often they don't turn out the way one would expect.",1298592000,92,917,4.6234567901234565
4391146,5,B004JUJNNC,"When Spartacus, ( Blood and Sand) first started playing on the tube, I only got to see a few episodes of it. It was enough to get me interested for sure! Then between my work and the series being aired so late, I was unable to watch ALL episodes. I went to Amazon and purchased the whole series of episodes and watched them almost from start to finish! The Daytime soaps doesnt have anything on Spartacus, Blood and Sand. The action and drama will keep you in much suspense and make you want to sit it out through all 13 episodes. I must admit that I did grow bored with spartacus' morning and pining for  his ""wonderful"" wife, but it wasn't enough boredom to stop me from watching. Maybe if they had allowed more scenes with him and her in it and let the viewer become more interested in their relationship, Spartacus' whining and pining would have been more worthwhile. Who knows. For those of you that like alot of action and drama and throw in alot of sex, these series is a must to watch and/or purchase!! I commend all the actors and actresses for a job well done. Sorry for Andy Whitfield's illness, is sad for such a young and budding actor. Can't wait to purchase Spartacus, Gods of the Arena!!",1298073600,7,1203,4.394618834080718
4391147,5,B004JUJNNC,"I'm new to the series, luckily DVR'ing the first 4 episodes of Gods of the Arena, and I have to say I absolutely love it. It has captured my attention--Tullius and Vettius make great protagonists to Batiatus--and I'm impressed at the realism for the time period--examples being when Quintas Batiatus (Hannah) and Solonius use the outdoor toilets and a community wipe (hand held device) as toilet paper, or in a scene where Batiatus is brushing his teeth with a wooden toothbrush bearing bristles. The verbiage and script is rich in color and a delight to behold. A word of caution, many scenes are graphic and r-rated (or worse), so definitely view with discretion if you have children in the house. I'm going to order the Blood and Sand series to get caught up on the story.",1297814400,4,775,4.705882352941177
4391148,4,B004JUJNNC,"At first I thought that it might be difficult to write about Spartacus: Gods of the Arena without revealing major spoilers to the Spartacus: Blood & Sand series that Gods is a prequel to. But then the first episode of Gods aired and, lo and behold, the ending scene of the first series is the opening scene of the prequel.

Now in my opinion that wasn't a very smart thing to do. After all, it basically assumes that there will be no newcomers to the series, right? I mean what if you were new to the series, you watched the prequel and were drawn into Blood & Sand only to now know the fate of the main characters of Blood and Sand that took 13 episodes to reveal with one of the best and most memorable season finales that I've ever seen?!?

I don't know, but I think that's kinda sucky.

Well, spoilers aside, Gods of the Arena is excellent. Gods chronicles the bloody and lewd days of the House of Batiatus prior to the arrival of Spartacus. It introduces us to Gannicus, one of Capua's initial champion warriors; it delivers Crixus to the scene and it documents the rise of Oenomaus to Doctore. But something is missing....Ah...what's missing is the item that made Blood & Sand a 5-Star series; what's missing is Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character.

Nevertheless, Starz has presented fans of Blood & Sand and newcomers to the series with a welcome gift with Gods of the Arena. John Hannah as Batiatus and Lucy Lawless as his wife Lucretia get a chance to reprise the roles that they excellently portrayed in Blood & Sand, and they again portray the roles with passion.

If you were a fan of Blood & Sand and you're not watching Gods of the Arena, you're cheating yourself out of a show that's almost as good as the original. And if you're new to the show, I recommend watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Sand/dp/B003PIUC02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood & Sand</a>&nbsp;first, then viewing Gods of the Arena so that the spoiler factor is erased.

Don't miss this excellent show.

Side note: Well wishes to Whitfield on a speedy recovery to his cancer which is why Gods of the Arena even exists. The prequel was initially formulated to hold fans over during Whitfield's recovery. But Starz recently announced that the role of Spartacus would need to be replaced (by Larry McIntyre) due to complications in Whitfield's  recovery. Tragic.",1297814400,23,2404,4.875
4391149,5,B004JUJNNC,"First off, Spartacus - Blood & Sand will go on!  HOWEVER, sadly it will not be with Andy Whitfield.  I will definitely miss him.  He was a great actor, and he is Spartacus. Starz plans to replace him with 29 year old Liam McIntyre, an Austrailian actor who does have an impressive likeness to Whitefield... but will it work?  With how people are hesitant when it comes to change, especially when fans adore Whitfield as they do, well it may be hard to swallow this pill.  But this new leading man can act at least, and with his likeness (and for many who may be worried, his 'yummieness') is close to Andy Whitfield's... so maybe after a few episodes air, Blood & Sand will be highly accepted once more. At least for me, I personally hope that comes to pass, because the show was magnificent.  However, I'll admit that I'm just as skeptic as most of you will be, mainly because Andy was amazing in the role, but only time will tell.  TO ANDY:  You're a remarkable man... he said that he wanted the show to go on with out him... that the story needed to be told.  GOD BLESS YOU MAN, I, as well as all your fans, wish you well in the future and to win your fight with cancer.

Now on to the Gods of the Arena... well honestly, I LOVE IT!  It lacks the original gravity of the show, however when it truly comes down it, this is a different show.  Perhaps a better title would have been SPARTACUS: Batiatus & Lucretia's Reign, or something of the like... because this show is more focused thus far on how the lanista becomes noteworthy for the games, as well as the rise of Crixus and how Oenomaus becomes doctore.  And I'm also assuming how his wife must die later, (possibly at the hands of the increasingly evil Batiatus in a later episode???... maybe not... this review is only 2 episodes in after all).

Enough speculation though.  We already know the houses' fate.  However, it is intersting to see how that fate truly is justice, not just through the wrongs the couple commit via Blood & Sand, but their prior crimes as well.  Plus, it adds to their development, and gives more insight on Crixus's character.  I for one liked the Lucretica and Batiatus, they were awful, yet very entertaining, so this is a bonus for me, and I'm sure a number of other fans of the show feel the same way.  Plus, it is a great filler until Blood & Sand season 2 premiers in early 2012, yes very long wait =(

I'll watch it though.  You can't opiniate a premier without viewing it... I may not want to view the rest, but I'll at least give the season opening a shot.  (Think the new American Idol, I've never watched more than 1 episode, if that, per season, and still don't by the way.  But what, 20ish other million americans have, and continue to do so.  Most were skeptical of Jennifer Lopez & Steven Tyler coming in, but from what I've read online and heard on the radio, they're starting to change their tunes... maybe the new Blood & Sand will surprise us all).",1296172800,6,2952,4.364468864468864
4391150,3,B004JUJNNC,"SPARTACUS: GODS OF THE ARENA  hit the screen as a waystation until the recovery of the ailing Andy Whitfield. It would have been far better had the producers awaited Whitfield's return or simply to change the format of this popular series in the event that Whitfield indeed may not be able to return at all. What we have now in the 'temporary arena' is a script that is so pottymouth oriented that even the most tolerant of audiences must find it oppressive. The manner in which the original show used physical encounters frequently at least had a modicum of taste, but in the new series the result is like a late night cheap porno movie. There is less character development in the newly introduced ludus owners and the new 'star gladiator' Gannicus (Dustin Clare) appears to devote more time to drinking and bedding than fighting. Ashur (Nick Tarabay) is back, not crippled yet, John Hannah returns as Batiatus with his promiscuous Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), Crixus (Manu Bennett) is also back as is Peter Mensah as the honorable teacher Oenomaus. Now that the DVD of the season is available the whole series can be viewed and admittedly the total season improved on the initial few episodes. The script is stilted 'contemporary Latin' (""apologies"") requiring subtitles to understand, and the blood flies around to an even greater extreme than in the original series. But the main problem with this new version is the lack of any characters for whom we care. While Whitfield is sorely missed, Dustin Clare as the new hero gladiator ended up a credible persona.

4391175,5,B004JUJNNC,"I thought it was odd to start Season 2 and find that Batiatus and Lucretia are back after we saw them butchered in the final episode of Season 1. It took a few minutes to realize that Season 2 starts much earlier than Season 1 and Batiatus is working his way up the influence ladder. His gladiator fight in a makeshift arena and put on displays in the dirt streets. A new champion Gannicus is apparently already establish at the start of Season 2.  Gannicus is superhuman, like Spartacus, but appears clownish as a drunken and whoring moron.

Many reviewers are lamenting the sex, violence and nudity in the series.  Based on everything I've read about ancient Rome, the portrayal of them as brutal, hard drinking, sex crazed psychos. There is prolific nudity in Season 2, possibly more than Season 1.  Full frontal female nudity is common, but the women bottom's are so hairy that the interesting parts cannot be seen.  In fact, small animals could live in those bushes.  Not so with the male nudity.  The parts are right out there in your face. Beautiful Lucy Lawless is back and her huge, perfectly formed, pink nipples adorning her 38 DD's and they get exposed in nearly every episode. I will never think of wholesome Xena in the same way again. Of course, here Lucy plays conniving Lucretia who is upwardly mobile and determined to become rich and powerful even using those around her as stepping stones.

There is a noticeable difference between the writing, acting and production in Season 2 vs. Season 1.  It seems to be less structured and borderline silly. The humping, nudity and the orgies seem more prevalent in Season 2.  Perhaps it is more realistic of Roman upper class life.",1482710400,,1691,4.7016949152542376
4391176,5,B004JUJNNC,"I absolutely love the Spartacus series (4 seasons).  This is the prequel to the first season and consists of only 6 episodes as the star of the first season (Andy Whitfield) was being treated for cancer so they decided to do a prequel they could leave him out of.  It is as fabulous as season 1.  The performances by Lucy Lawless and John Hannah should have earned them all the possible awards that actors/actresses get.  Now that is true acting!  In season 1 they make you despise and hate them.  In this prequel, they make you feel sorrow and empathy for them.  You even feel sorry for how Asher was treated and learn why he becomes the villain that he does in the rest of the series. Haven't been moved that way by any actors or actresses in quite awhile.  It's hard to believe they weave so much into just 6 episodes, but they do.  You'll love the drama, intrigue, violence, complex relationships and storylines in this series.  I would only recommend this for adults as the Spartacus series portrays what life was really like in ancient Rome with all the violence, language, nudity & sex that existed in the culture.",1481932800,,1121,4.532338308457711

4391234,5,B004JUJNNC,"This is the ultimate guy series. Gorgeous, often nude women in the Zena mold and plenty of blood and gore and that cool slow-mo effect put to good use in most if not all fighting scenes. The main character is best described as a latter day rock star. Were Spartacus is a short haired stoic, leader of men who is unwavering in his ultimate goal and ideals. Gannicus is his moral opposite. Gannicus is a long haired, smart assed death machine who you would only follow to the nearest bar or whore house. Who's motto is sex drugs and rock and roll. And is often found drunkenly recovering in the arms of his last nights sexual conquests. He is truly ""living the life"" of the number one and most popular gladiator in his stable. Even their fighting styles are different. Spartacus is technically perfect and does everything by the book. While Gannicus is flashy and flamboyant and often seems to be making his moves up as he fights.

This series is set before the original season when Spartacus was captured.. I was told it was made to fill time as the original person who played Spartacus recovered from cancer. He sadly died later and never returned. So Spartacus does not show up in this season I don't believe. But fear not Gannicus is a much more interesting and fun character than Spartacus is any way. Spartacus is he man you want to lead your army. Gannicus is the man you want to party with and by your side when the bar fight breaks out. He is easily my favorite character in the entire series as he shows up again and often in later seasons. A young, long haired and very naive, stick in the mud, Cirxus shows up and is taught the ropes of the arena. Mainly by doing the opposite of anything he sees Gannicus doing. And Oenomause is the wise leader of the stables and the only one Gannicus respects and sometimes listens to. It helps that Gannicus adores Oenomause's wife like a much loved older sister he keeps disappointing.

The surprisingly good writing in this season and all the others makes the entire series much more than the hack and slash bare breasted extravaganza that I originally tuned in for.. And you actually find yourself caring for many of the characters and the problems they face.",1459209600,,2209,4.533834586466165

I did like this prequel as it set up and provided missing background to the story. I watched this a couple of times on Starz and recently bought all the seasons on DVD. Compare prices carefully, as when I made my purchases, it was a lot cheaper to buy separate seasons than collections. I bought used as most people only watch this type of this once or at most a few times so used are in good condition. None of mine had a scratch; they all played perfect and now I can sell them back.

But then I really got into it, and found it addicting and engrossing. The energy, the passion and emotion, the great hyper-real cinematography, it is all amazing.

No, Blood and Sand BEFORE Gods of the Arena.  Next question, Why was it called Spartacus when he appears nowhere?  I guess that would be for continuity.  Okay, my favored characters are there, Doctore (Oenomeus), Crixus, Barca and the ones EVERYBODY loves to hate, Ashur and Solonius.

In six episodes Gods of the Arena manage to make sense of Blood and Sand.  That was no mean feat as BaS seemed to have storylines going hither, yon, up and down.  There were times BaS had so much going on a scorecard would have been appreciated.

Gods of the Arena proves prequels CAN work if those who produce, write, direct and act truly want to be there.  GotA is most impressive.",1426464000,,845,4.566666666666666

4391327,5,B004JUJNNC,"In no way does Season 2 live up to the grand spectacle that was Season 1, but it's still outstanding television that blows away almost anything else out there. Thematically, it fits perfectly with the standards that were established in the premiere season, once more celebrating the violence, mayhem, and chronic excess that were paramount in this flawed Roman empire. What's perhaps most impressive is that even without Spartacus, whose charisma and screen presence are amazing, Gods of the Arena continues to excel. This is a credit to the rest of the outstanding cast, as well as some great writing. Fans of the first season will love seeing back story on a slew of now deceased characters, such as Quintus, Barka, and fan favorite Lucretia. I'll admit, even I was surprisingly pleased to see these dirtbags resurrected for more screen time, even though I loathe them. That's what makes this series so good - you enjoy all the characters, even the ones you dislike. On a final note, the hero of this season, Gannicus, does a noble job filling in for the absent Spartacus, giving the man a good running for likability and screen presence. However, his goals and personality are notably different, which is again a credit to the writers, who tried something a little different and found success.",1425168000,,1296,4.8954545454545455

But I do.  The actors are excellent.  The plot is great, and it moves quickly.  I love the fighting choreography.  Some of my favorite fight scenes are in this series.

I also did some research about the show being historically correct and yes, it's very close.  And what I mean is the show portrays the Romans and gladiators very close to the real deal.  It's not perfect but from what I read, it's close.  Two things are a little off.  Gladiators did not shave them selves, that is why the Romans called the gladiators beast because there were so hairy.  And, the gladiators did not dies as often as the show portrays.  About 2/3 of the fights were NOT to the death.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, you just have to get past the most T&A of any show every on paid TV!",1419292800,,774,4.168918918918919

4391361,5,B004JUJNNC,"Take the nasty language of today, including profanity and f-bombs every minute or two and dilute it with an Old English version of Roman nomenclature from the period surrounding the slave uprising of 100 BC or so. Add lots of sex, nudity, vulgarity. Mix in some excellent acting, fast-paced action, excellent sets, and superb high-fueled slow motion special effects centered around warring gladiators. The outcome? Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. Don't let the title fool you, however. Since this is a prequel to the other seasons of Starz's Spartacus series, the title character is noticeably absent. The focus is on Gannicus and his cohorts attempting to make a name for themselves within the ludus within the walls of the House of Battiatus, an entity run by a Roman slave owner hell bent on entering the political arena via domination of the gladiator games. Lucy Lawless, probably the best known of any of the actors in the series, shines in both acting ability and beauty.",1418601600,,976,4.9573170731707314

In this show (Hank refuses to think of this as merely a ""TV series,"" it costs too much and is much too dirty and way much too entertaining), the ""Upstairs"" are the owners, the high-class Capuans consisting of violent and horny men, and horny and violent wives.  The ""Downstairs"" are the slaves they own, their servants and potential gladiators, who are all pretty much slaves anyway.  This is best understood as a rivalry between two local families, equally old, one a little snottier and effete  (and better at verbally doing the dozens or should I call it the XII's) with the other family with whom we are supposed to identify, headed over by a well-educated but slightly wussy head of the family ""Batiatus"" (John Hannah, previously best known in the USA as Simon Callow's lover in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) and his dish of a wife (Lucy Lawless, creatively corrupt, and probably the best actor in a series full of good actors).  Think of it as ""Friday Night Lights"" with the snotty family as Midland and the family Batiatus, with whom we're to identify, as Odessa and you've got it made, especially since gladiatorial prowess is the whole town's obsession, almost as much as high-school football is to West Texas.

Once in a while the Batiatus *Paterfamilias* shows up from the family seaport in Sicily (back then, wealth was based on trading in food, not trading in oil) and shames his son rather too effectively about what a wuss he is, while the script shows him retaining enough of a ""mad old dog"" waggishness that we can't hate him entirely, at least not as much as his son does.  Now, some critics have said that this show recreates late-Republican Rome (Italia) imprecisely, and it is certainly true that it doesn't worry about dialectical differences between the Capital (Rome) and provincial Ostia, and that we see next to nothing of the middle class a trading city would have (although one character is clearly shown as the one who caters to the Batilati in fine wines, etc. -- I think of him as the show's Tom Hagen).

At other times, the critics may have found the show rather too realistic, because it is beyond crude and into naturalistic, such as the amalgam of blood, guts and pig ""droppings"" that constituted the portion of town where the food market and the slave market and the gladiator camps all converged.  You see the men using the public latrines, which were open-air, although lack of a communal ""six-holer"" did not keep most of them from urinating in any corner when Natura called.  In all fairness, we do not see urine leave the male appendage from the male appendage until we see one of the ""bad"" clan have a go at young Batiatus, after he'd had him beaten, just to show that he was REALLY miffed (thus Batiatus went from a symbolic bedpan to something of a real one).

As with elimination, the line between public and private nudity in sport and sexual expression is vague and wandering.  The upper-class women love to go see the gladiators practice, especially the two breakout hunks whose plot this part of the series really is.  One is blond and smooth, one is swarthy and hairy, and both are jaw-droppingly handsome above the waist and well-endowed with a capital ""H"" below it.  Practically all the series is cast with actors from the UK, Australia and New Zealand, partly, I suspect, because the men so often have to give an ""uncut"" performance if you know what I mean.

When the women are being genteel, they call it a ""thing"" and when they aren't, they talk a great deal like the men, and the men use words that rhyme with ""clock,"" ""falls,"" ""clock-and-falls,"" ""farce,"" ""farcehole,"" ""hits,"" ""bunt,"" ""truck,"" ""trucking,"" ""miss-and-sit"" and such them in ways that would make a ground-level construction worker in August, 1969, blush.  It's weird, and even Uncle Hank found the script's use (and misuse) of such coarse talk strange and subject to misgiving.  The script was riddled with pseudo-Shakespearean-isms like ""My ""farce"" yearns for the comforting if foul breath of the toilet's hole,"" but there's also an awful lot of ""I will ram this trucking saber through your trucking farcehole until your very clock will scream in bloody separation from your dead body with your ""falls"" hanging in between, uncommitted to either.""  Uncle Hank, despite rumors to the contrary, was not actually alive at the time of the Romans, but he knows that any society complex enough to let high-bred women euphemise such organs to ""thing,"" is complex enough to have a whole bunch of slang words for penis, not just ""clock.""  It's boring, and it hasn't nearly the wit of the swears in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, say.

Of nudity, your friend Hank is much more liberal.  There is some full frontal of men, a little more full frontal of women, and a considerable amount of what cultural critic Ethan Mordden calls ""backal"" of both sexes.  Maybe this is why children are seen so rarely as to be nonexistent? Well, this second year of SPARTACUS for STARZ is fine entertainment nonetheless, but Uncle Hank's nephew, who is only twenty-six, may not be quite old enough for such ""earthiness.""  Don't say I didn't tell you!  However, there is some marvelous acting, and even the constant sense of menace and inevitable breakouts of blood-and-guts are well done even though the speech is so monotonously rare in interesting swear.  As I said, it was highly entertaining, and I'll be back for the concluding seasons (which take place AFTER Year One, I think) as soon as Allen orders them, and is fool enough to let me watch the place when he's gone.

It is sad though when one realizes that the prequel was made in order to give Andy Whitman time to recover from his illness, which sadly he did not do.

The prequel contains all of the graphic blood, gore, sex and violence that was within Season 1. Wheteher one is a fan of all the prior or not, the stories of the characters and the character development are very good.

BUT, it started playing on the Science Fiction channel more often & well, I got hooked!  And I was a Lucy Lawless fan when she was Xena way back in the 90s?!?

Just like the description, this is a prelude before Spartacus comes on board, but just as interesting b/c Gannicus is HOT! This show is just brave w/ some scenes down to the nudity & violence - both look SOOooo real. I still wonder how da heck the actors can do some of the sex scenes, they look so real. I fast forward the gay sex scenes, I cant handle 2 or more very, manly & good looking men kissing heavily, it's icky, yuck!

So, if u enjoyed Sparty 1-3, then you'll love Gods of the Arena & yes they are! Hot bods & eye candy for women!

4391423,2,B004JUJNNC,"Not so much. I'm okay with gratuitous sex and violence, but the slowmo blood spatter was unnecessary. The dialogue and acting are horrible, and there is a very weak attempt at almost Shakespearean language that makes it even worse. John Hannah is awful. The only bright spots were the nudity and sex. It was gratifying to see Lucy Lawless nude. Otherwise, this is a waste of time.",1408406400,,380,4.686567164179104

4391453,5,B004JUJNNC,"I love Blood and Sand more, but Gods of the Arena was still good. It gave the fans exactly what they wanted; women, booze, and blood. There was not a single moment that I doubted if Spartacus could continue on without its main lead watching this prequel. From the first episode to the last, it is as if the writers and director was saying ""Hey, we lost a very vital component to this show, but he would want it to continue on. So, in honor of his memory, we are going over the top with this"" and sure enough, we have more boobs, butt, and blood than even before. Just six episodes, it is enough to show us that Spartacus can continue on.",1401148800,,637,4.186991869918699

  craig",1400544000,,135,4.826086956521739
4391457,5,B004JUJNNC,"This series is easily one of my favorite television shows of all time, and even though this prequel is a small piece of the puzzle I don't think it would have been the same without it.  I'd even go as far as to say it is the best season of this show in my book.  Even through this is a prequel I strongly advise first time viewers to watch this after they have seen Blood and Sand.  There is a major spoiler in the first few minutes of the first episode that ties up the final episode of the first season.

There are plenty of reasons to love Spartacus but here is a few that make Gods of the Arena special to me.  First of all we get to see more of John Hannah as Batiatus who will go down as one of my favorite villains of all time.  Secondly we get to return to the ludus which is almost a character in and of itself with all of the events that happen inside of it's walls.

Possibly one of the best things this prequel brings to the table is the introduction to my personal favorite character Gannicus.  Gannicus is a Celtic gladiator who makes up for his lack of discipline and training by being a warrior with pure talent inside of the arena.  We also get to see Crixus bring brought into the fold and shaped into the champion of Capua we see him as in Blood and Sand.  Believe it or not there is a lot of story crammed into this 6 episode season and it will definitely give you better understanding when you see just how brothers and bitter enemies are formed amongst several different characters in the later seasons.

I might be a huge Spartacus fanboy but I cannot give any of these seasons less than 5 stars.  I will recommend this show to anyone who loves drama, action, and amazing violence that depicts the brutality of ancient Rome.  If this sounds good to you then you absolutely must watch this show from the beginning till it's fantastic and bloody end.",1400284800,,1871,4.236619718309859

4391462,3,B004JUJNNC,"Anyone who believes they are going to get the quality of the previous season is going to be gravely disappointed. What we have here is the equivalent of daytime soap opera with buckets of spraying red paint and absurd R-rated sex scenes between all genders. The acting is the equivalent of Days of Our Lives, no better, and the actors even resemble that burnished hunks and dames who have apparently found transient acting jobs. The dialogue is incomprehensible, with actors blurting things like, ""If Skinnius Rexus finds out what Tiberius Glocus knows about Shamus Mixus...we're in big trouble!"" while gravely nodding. All in all your first thought on spending your hard-earned cash will be, ""Netflix,"" where in fact I was wise enough to get the disks one by one.

4391466,5,B004JUJNNC,"Gods of the Arena gives nice insight to some of our favorites from the main show. Gannicus and Oenomaus are two of my favorites, and each character gets some welcome attention in this short six episode prequel. Of course, it's nice to see the machinations and shenanigans of John Hannah and Lucy Lawless once again as well, as this collection shows their rise to power in the arena.

If you like Starz's ""Spartacus"", then this is a must-add.",1397520000,,441,4.653846153846154
4391467,4,B004JUJNNC,"A very under-appreciated series.  I was a little skeptical after watching the first several episodes of the first season, but I absolutely loved every episode after the third.

4391468,1,B004JUJNNC,"Unfortunately this series somehow lost its way or purpose. There is no storyline to unfold, not plot to discover. Instead the entire series has degraded itself to nothing less than a gay porn movie and repeated fighting scenes that never seem to go anywhere.

This series, seems to focus on multiple close up penile shots of men in baths together, urinating together (or on each other) and then have sex with each other. After this they finish it all off with another senseless bloodthirsty fight. The movie deserves an X rating for this alone.

Anyone with the smallest amount of gladiatorial knowledge knows that this is not how a Ludus operated, and certainly not how gladiators behaved or lived.

This series is an outright disgrace to Romans, Historians, enthusiasts, our past Gladiators and the name Spartacus.",1396656000,,816,4.985294117647059

I watched most of the seasons and episodes with Starz on demand but part of the 2nd or 3rd season was unavailable for some reason. Luckily, a google search for the missing episodes brought me to Amazon where I could watch the episodes I missed for $2 each. Of course, the finale was not what I wanted to happen to Spartacus but history or myth says he did die of wounds sustained on the battlefield but his grave has never been found.

My own mistake for not reading what was included in the complete set, but typically they don't insert prequels that way.  In spite of that I got a good deal and have really enjoyed the series.  I may try to sell this DVD set on eBay or something as I do not need it.  I had opened the pack already so cannot return it. (It was a prequel. I watched it first!)

But it should definitely be watched AFTER watching the 3-yr. series as there is a small spoiler for Season 1 at the end of Gods of the Arena.",1388102400,,354,3.863013698630137

4391515,5,B004JUJNNC,"I started watching the first season of Spartacus mainly because of Lucy Lawless (I'm a huge fan of Xena:Warrior Princess).  However, I got drawn into the other principle characters enough to continue watching that entire season.  Although Season One, with the late Andy Whitfield was great, Season Two with Dustin Clare as Gannicus was outstanding.  I just loved that dude.  And, of course, watching Lucy Lawless and Jaime Murray hook up wasn't too shabby either.",1387152000,,463,5.133333333333334

4391518,5,B004JUJNNC,Love the series.  Not a bad take on what happened back then.  Nice gory death scenes helps some a lot of nudity.  All around a good show. Andy Whitfield will always be the best Spartacus he was taken away way too soon.,1386633600,,218,4.142857142857143

4391520,5,B004JUJNNC,"I first saw a few episodes of Spartacus while traveling and got hooked. Now I am on the last season of this series. It is not for the faint of heart. It is as grizzly as a slasher film and full of profanity and nudity as well. I laughed when my father in law sat down and put it in thinking it was the original movie! It did not take him long to figure out it wasn't . . . but he kept watching.
  This series has such in-depth characters, settings, and story-lines I could not help but be drawn into the world, story and character's lives. This series is one I'll watch over and again.",1386460800,,585,4.0344827586206895

4391526,5,B004JUJNNC,Excellent prequel to Blood and Sand featuring all of the characters (except Spartacus) from the series. Highly recommended because of the intricacies of the storyline.,1384819200,,167,5.72
4391527,5,B004JUJNNC,"Hate to love this series which plays to the worst in us: violence and a lot of gratuitous sex.  But Spartacus' story is enlightening even after 2,000 years and the sets and costumes transport me into ancient Italy in the most wonderful way.  The is probably the most bloody set of images I have ever seen.  I also like the way the dialog attempts to give us the flavor of Latin.  My Latin is very, very poor, but it was interesting to 'hear' the cadence of their words translated into modern English.  Did Spartacus really lose when he is still a hero after 2,000 years?  I also relish the message inherent in our fascination with this story: we are the brutal Romans of this age.  Like I said: hate to love it.",1384646400,,711,4.340909090909091

4391530,5,B004JUJNNC,Andy Whitfield was and will always be my favorite Spartacus.  The writers and director makes the violence less bloody and to know what the slaves went through is mind boggling.  I do know real from TV,1384128000,,200,4.527777777777778

4391541,5,B004JUJNNC,"When I first heard they were going to do a prequel to Spartacus Blood and Sand I was not sure if it would meet expectations. But I was very pleasantly surprised. To see the history of Doctore and Crixus and the introduction of the character of Gannicus helped any disappointment the fans were feeling disappear. To see Lucy Lawless' character's love for her husband and desperate need to help him succeed gave a new layer of depth to Lucretia. And again, thank the Gods for the introduction of Gannicus.",1381104000,,503,4.662921348314606

4391543,5,B004JUJNNC,"This part of the overall Spartacus series was my least favorite and I actually didn't watch it until after Blood & Sand and Vengence, I watched it while I was jonesing for War of the Damned to start.  Because it was made while they were waiting for Andy Whitfield (Spartacus) to go through his treatment for cancer, there were no scenes with Spartacus (except for flashbacks).  It was interesting in its own right and it certainly did provide a lot of answers for questions I had regarding Oenomaus & Gannicus friendship.  Just with the other installment of the series, I HIGHLY recommend.",1380758400,,589,4.754901960784314

4391556,5,B004JUJNNC,"Let me first preface this by saying I am NOT a prude and can swear with the best of 'em when I need to. That being said, WOW!!! my only problem with this whole production is the EXCESSIVE use of the 2 'C' words and of course the ever popular 'F' word. My God guys!  I'm sure the ancient Romans could  swear up a storm, but soooooo much?  It takes away from the beauty of the rest of the dialogue, which has a definte Shakesperean flavor to it. Quite frankly it gets tiresome after a while and makes the characters sound like low class trash instead upper class Romans.
That being said, I've recorded  the other 3 productions on the DVR and bought the 'Gods...."" DVR planning to also buy the others, so you know I'm a complete fan.
The beautiful actors and actresses,(Andy,Manu, and Liam hmmmmm), the gorgeous costumes, the incredible fight scenes (WOW),and oh yeah, all the naked guys (lol) have made for many hours of complete escape. But please don't flood us with Cs and
F's quite so much when something else might be used to get the point across..  Another thought occured to me.......as depraved and blood thirsty as the Romans were, I find it quite ironic (as a Catholic) that the Church put the Vatican in Rome!!!

Now that I have access I will continue to watch each segment, as many times as I want, and will be able to see and hear some of the things I have missed. There are so many  images ,etc. that to watch one time is not enough to gather it all in.
My family likes to wait till we have watched all the parts of a series, and then have ""marathons"" - weekends where we watch from beginning to end! The Spartacus marathon will be spectacular !!",1377734400,,651,4.038759689922481

4391560,5,B004JUJNNC,What a great series.  This was the shortened season that acted as a filler due to the loss of the lead actor of Season 1.  It stands by itself and is gripping in its own right.  You do get involved in the story and characters.  It was great to see Gannicus show up in Season 3 (really 2 of the main story).  I can't wait for the final season to come out on Blu Ray.,1375833600,,365,3.8133333333333335

4391576,5,B004JUJNNC,"I'm usually a book reader, but was looking for something different.  I recently watched the 2 seasons of Game of Thrones and was looking for something similar. The Spartacus series filled that desire and more. We see life from the Master of the house point of view to the slaves that serve them and the Gladiators who fight for them. The story lines are well written and you will find a hero or two to cheer for and some you will love to hate.  The show is filmed with amazing camera work and put together well.  I like the modern music some of the fight scenes are put to, it gives the theme an updated feel.  All in all, the action, story and acting are all packed. This is series 0. Be sure to get 1 and 2. They are just as good. The only thing to caution you is some of the fight scenes are gruesome (intestines spilling out and the like) and you are going to see lots of naked women and men. If you are a fan of True Blood on HBO, you will see Godric (Eric's maker) in the 2nd season.",1372032000,,989,4.056410256410256

The episode was well thought out and gives real insight into the beginnings of some characters within' the show from the first season. I was definitely not disappointed with another great season.

It's very well done! Being set into the same society and places we were presented in Blood and Sand, but taking place a few years just before Spartacus's epic. Most of the cast from the previous show is back, the produces did fairly well making them look somewhat younger. seeing some familiar faces just years before Spartacus is good, gives us a bit more connection and more in depth to the characters themselves.

Featuring more of Batiatus, he brings the show to life with his role.

4391584,2,B004JUJNNC,"I really enjoyed Spartacus: Blood and Sand, despite the Klingon-style English, the peculiar costumes, and the frequent disregard for historical accuracy. It succeeded for me because of its grand-scale characters and fast-paced storytelling, as well as its basic fidelity to what we know about the real Spartacus. Gods of the Arena, however, has no basis in history, and every episode simply cannibalizes one or more plot-lines from Blood and Sand. Still worse, Dustin Clare as Gannicus is an unappealing protagonist, without the warmth and humanity of Andy Whitfield and without even moderate ability as an actor. His principal efforts at characterization involve growling all his lines in a soft, menacing tone while maintaining a consistent three-day growth of beard. When you add the poor storytelling to the poor casting and the poor acting, and then take stock of the historical silliness, you get a big disappointment for any true-blue fan of the gladiator epic.  A few details of which the scriptwriters appear ignorant: First, in Spartacus' day, Capua was renowned throughout Italy as a city of wealth, luxury, and beauty -- yet in this series it is depicted as a squalid slum. Second, Capua was a multi-ethnic city that had only recently been absorbed by Rome. The local population spoke Oscan, while the city's new Roman ruling class enforced the use of Latin for all official business. The natives resented their Roman overlords, and there was a wide social gulf between them. We get no hint of this in the series. Third, gladiators never aspired to ""honor."" They were well aware that, as social outcasts, they were automatically regarded as ""infames"" -- disgraced men with no hope of achieving honor. Yet we constantly hear Crixus the Gaul yammering about honor. It's fashionable now to claim that period movies and TV don't need to pay attention to history because they're ""just movies"" or ""just TV."" But isn't it funny how the most historically accurate shows are usually the best?",1370995200,,1995,5.0823170731707314

This season focuses on Gannicus, who is a rock star in the arena. I hate blood and yuck and covered my eyes when I knew something gory was going to happen. After awhile you start to love and hate characters so much you don't notice. This is Ancient Rome at it's finest with all the gratuitous scenes you can handle. The story itself is interesting but it doesn't hurt that it is full of muscular sweaty gorgeous men.  Not for viewing anywhere near children.

4391604,5,B004JUJNNC,"The acting in Spartacus is superb. The sets, camera work, and the writing are extremely well done. The language and nudity were perhaps overdone, but the attempt to portray Rome as it was is understood. However, it did not need the exaggeration that many who would enjoy the production immensely might find objectionable. The new actor for Spartacus, who replaced the one who tragically passed away filled the role tremendously. The story is captivating.

If a guest wants to screw a slave, well, the slave is screwed.  If the slaves irritate anyone in any way, they feed them to the lions, etc.  It's good to be an elite, but really, really sucks to be a slave in that time in history in the Roman Empire.  But the blood and guts are non-stop and I learned where the phrase ""It's the pits"" came from watching Spartacus, and what it means.",1367712000,,533,4.176470588235294

The main characteristic is that the episodes are entertaining, as there is almost nonstop fighting (that's what gladiators do, right?), sex (that's what gladiators and their masters do), and treachery (that's what the masters do best). Some of the dialogue was a little overdone and tended to pull me out of the story, but I didn't have to wait long before I was pulled back in again.

The writing, the sets, and the casting, everything is great about those shows. And when it comes to casting, if ever there was an actor who can command both the respect of his male audience, and the hearts of his female audience, it's Dustin Clare. He's a ""man's man"" and that's not gay, btw. It means that Dustin Clare is a man other men (straight men) can respect, even admire. I'd say he would be the perfect actor for the role of Trent Smith in the book, Killer of Killers, if that might ever be made into a movie. In Killer of Killers, Trent Smith is a martial arts champion, and who better to play the part of a martial arts champion than Dustin Clare, AKA Gannicus, the champion gladiator. But I digress. Suffice it to say Dustin Clare is such a complete actor, he could play any tough guy in any film. Kudos to Starz for casting Dustin Clare as Gannicus.",1364169600,,973,4.351648351648351

I have always been a fan of ancient Rome movies and shows...yes, I even used to be addicted to Xena: Warrior Princess.  I finally bit the bullet and paid to download season 1 and FELL IN LOVE.  The characters, the drama, the violence (totally gratuitous in most places, but visually uh-Mazing!), the sex...everything about it was raw and engaging.  I did some research on Andy Whitfield, and when I realized that Gods of the Arena was made as a prequel, essentially to buy time while everyone hoped for his recovery, I almost didn't even bother with it.  But I am SO glad that I did.  The characters in Gods of the Arena bring SO much to the table, and I fell in love with them.  Seeing the start of the villains and the O. G.s (Original Gladiators...Ice T anyone?)  really made seasons 2 and 3 so much more impacting.  As sad as Andy Whitfield's untimely death is, the creators of the show have definitely done his character justice in continuing on such a strong path.  If you're wondering if you need to see this ""prequel"" season in order to enjoy seasons 2 and 3, the answer is YES!

4391664,5,B004JUJNNC,"I loved this show.  I missed it on the original airing.  I saw Spartacus the second season in total and most of the first season.  This season had a different tone because Spartacus had not yet arrived on scene.  I loved the backstories.  I actually would have loved a full season.  I am so sad this year is the last.  There is so much to love.  The violence is sometimes hard to take but the stories are great.  I loved Gannicus he makes Gods of the Arena for me.  I will definately miss seeing him on my tv but I have my kindle so he can live forever there.  If you like the Spartacus series, then this should not be missed.",1360281600,,626,4.090909090909091

4391668,5,B004JUJNNC,"....but not cure your need to see Andy Whitfield again. He was TRULY the best leading man for the role of Spartacus.

4391673,5,B004JUJNNC,"I just ordered this.  I saw it on Netflix 3x when it was instant when it first came out and I just had to have the entire season to watch whenever I want.  This happens to be my favorite season!  Gory and sexy!  I like this story better than the others as well.  The story keeps moving along, whereas the others keep you in the same spot knowing that nothing would ever change no matter how much we, the audience, wanted it to.

I also love Gaia's role in this season, better than the annoying Elythia in the others seasons, even though Viva Bianca plays her role very well.

In addition, the suspense of Gannicus & Melita's love affair keeps you on your feet and you really will not know what happens next.  My favorite!",1359763200,,721,4.288888888888889

4391685,5,B004JUJNNC,"I must admit, that when this was first aired on Starz, I was pretty ticked off that it was only 6 Episodes long. But these are some of the deepest 6 episodes in the series. It dives into a man torn between a friend and a lover, and the outcome will surprise some and disgust others. If you liked the first season, this is a must have.",1358553600,,334,4.0
4391686,1,B004JUJNNC,"Could not watch it due to incorrect zoning.  Didn't think to look for zoning when ordering.  I think Amazon should consider making the zoning more obvious for purchasers in different zoning areas.  I purchased the collection again at a local retailer and i must say we are thoroughly enjoying it - a bit gori, blood, guts etc. and a lot of sex scenes.  A interesting story line!!!!",1358380800,,381,4.641791044776119

They are nasty characters in many ways, none of the characters are angels, there's no real protagonist I have to say. But you do root for their fates. Bad but real people and it's liberating in a way to be in their companionship.",1358294400,,386,4.450704225352113

4391692,5,B004JUJNNC,"When The Tudors ended, I despaired not having another series to watch. Then along came Spartacus with Andy Whitfield. Then he had a sudden resurgence of cancer from which he was previously in remission, and he was gone. Then the creators came up with an ingenious idea: create a prequel that tells the story of Crixus. They kept five to six of the original cast from the first series, and viewers got to see others like Barca, who died in the middle of the first season. Above that, GOTA introduced Gannicus. Played by Dustin Clare, Gannicus is one of the few characters that does the most fascinating evolution throughout the series, and shows a range of acting that is strikingly absent in most of the other characters, save Andy Whitfield from the first season. His evolution continues in Spartacus: Vengeance, and he and Crixus (played by Manu Bennett) do an excellent job as major supporting actors, helping die-hard fans of the first season who miss Andy Whitfield's presence.",1357862400,,982,4.851190476190476

Gannicus is such a interesting character that this story should have lasted much longer than six measly episodes! It has a wonderful back story that shedded so much light on how the characters we love to hate actually got that way. If you loved ""blood and Sand"" you will not be disappointed with ""Gods of the Arena""!",1357344000,,447,4.6

4391705,5,B004JUJNNC,The actual start of the story and how the status quo was obtained.  I do have to say the Romans must have gone to school to learn how to party.  Never a  dull moment.  Plots and subplots were very abundant in the story...,1356739200,,221,4.069767441860465

Zero season turned out great.  But this series isn't something I'd watch again.  So far I've seen 3 seasons.  and this one was the best..  this and the first season.  I would give it a 5 star but the series is going south.  So giving a 5 just doesnt seem right.  the show should have ended with this season.  Season zero and season 1 is probably were they should have ended it.  There supposed to have a season 4.. not sure I'm going to bother.,1356307200,,602,4.147826086956521

4391738,5,B004JUJNNC,"This is an excllent series. It has an overabundance of almost everything. Blood, violence, drama, action, suspense, sex, and betrayal are all presented in full force in this very heavy nad brutal series. I am also very impressed by the acting and story line. I don't think there is hardly anything on TV worth watching, but this series is way better than the average crap on my idiot box. I am so glad that that I saw Spartacus. If you aren't afraid of a lot of the stuff I mentioned earlier, then definitely check this out.

After making Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with cancer, which he recently passed away with. I read an article
in the paper talking about it. While Andy was receiving treatment for his cancer, they decided to go ahead and make this prequel. It said that while it was possible to get another actor, they wanted Andy to do the next season. He did such a marvelous job, there is no way a man like that can be replaced. The events in this season all take place in the time just before Spartacus arrives at House Batiatus. There are many of the old characters, and plenty of new one as well. The story in this season is almost as good as the first. Everything else that you have come to expect from this show is also showcased in God's of the Arena. If you liked season 1, then season 2 is gonna make you happy too.",1354233600,,1350,4.335968379446641

4391746,5,B004JUJNNC,"I really enjoyed the first series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The show had everything: action, violence, passionate story lines and above all, great historical accuracy. So as a history junkie, I couldn't wait for more on the series. Sadly Toby Whitfield, who played Spartacus, passed away and the producers came out with Spartacus: Gods of the Arena as a pre-story to the first series. ""Gods of the Arena"" does an excellent job explaining in much graphic detail how things came to happen in Capua before Spartacus appears in the arena. The cast is fantastic and creates a very believable glimpse into life in ancient Rome. John Hannah, Lucy Lawless, Manu Bennett, and Peter Mensah all reprise their wonderful roles from Blood and Sand. Newcomer Dustin Clare as the hero gladiator Gannicus,establishes himself as an incredible actor to keep an eye on.

The writing seemed a bit off and (someone please tell me if it's my imagination) the dialogue seemed stranger than in the first season. I know they've always spoken in what is supposed to be ""Latin"", but this season seemed more immersed in that style than even the previous one.

Great design, and plus being probably one of the best series ever, the price you pay for it is WELL WORTH IT, and I even paid for international shipping fees, still it was a GREAT PRICE.

The only negative thing I would say, and this is for INTERNATIONAL ONLY, is that it took about a month or more for the product to arrive in my house, and I live in Mexico, which is next to USA.

4391758,2,B004JUJNNC,"My girlfriend and I started watching the first season, Blood and Sand, when it first aired and we were hooked. We diligently TIVO'd every episode so that we wouldn't fall behind and could not wait to see what happened next. I would say that the first season, Blood And Sand, is definitely worth watching.

The second season, Gods of the Arena, became tedious after the first several episodes, I gradually got bored with the writing. The writers seemed to be grasping at re-wording the same, vulgarly witty catch-phrases. It became so obvious and cheap that I finally gave up.

The writing was something like this: Instead of saying ""I'll stab the beast in the heart!"" They would say something like ""The beast's heart shall find piercing from my blade."" Okay, fine, I love it when the language is more poetic and richly explored. However, EVERY line was like this. Instead of saying saying ""I have to go to the toilet."" They would say ""The toilet's seat must find my arse!"" Etc... It became gimmicky rather than poetic. It was formulaic rather than clever.

I ultimately found the dialog annoying and juvenile, the story boring and extremely slow-moving, the plot too simple, and the action predictable and lame. It became a festival of ""shock the viewer"" gimmicks with barely a spec of intrigue when compared to its predecessor.

I give two stars instead of one because of the production quality and the inventiveness with which the producers/writers/directors handled the real-life tragedy of the original star's death. Also, most of the actors did a fine job, especially with such physical roles.",1347580800,2,1598,4.929368029739777

Every other word was blatantly spoken with sexually explicit language with the ""C"" word and the other ""C"" word. Wow. So disgusting and how disappointing. The timing was terrible. It was like a rushed dialogue and none of the actors were acting in a cohesive manner except Peter Mensah as Oenomaus.

4391774,5,B004JUJNNC,"For those of you that know, the main actor that plays Spartacus got cancer after the first season, and was getting treatment for it, and therefore could not participate in the second season that had been planned.  Unfortunately, that actor died, which was very sad not only because he was a very good actor, but because people should not die of such a disease at such an early age.  Life is not fair, but it is what it is, and life must go on.

It is a great story, with superior actors, and a fascinating look at one possible example of how living in those times might really have been.  It is bloody, and it is lurid, but it feels so right of an example of gladiatorial life in the Roman Era.

Now I've watched every episode on cable TV, and I can hardly wait for the next season.  There are re-runs on TV, so why would I spend my money on this product?  The answer is simple.  This series is one of the very best to be on TV since Babylon 5, and I feel it is my duty as a consumer of entertainment to put my dollars down to show my appreciation of what they wrought.  It is only by showing this debt of gratitude that producers will be willing to make more shows of this quality when they see that people appreciate their efforts.  Will I watch these episodes on DVD, you betcha!  It's pleasant to usually get even better video quality, and no commercials to boot!",1342137600,,1367,4.219230769230769

A worthy mini series that has be now chomping at the bit for S2.",1339459200,,311,4.254237288135593
4391776,3,B004JUJNNC,"Quick explanation:
85% excessive (and normally useless) hardcore sex (lads and lasses alike, mix/match as well) and hardERcore violence.
15% story.
That's to say the backstory behind certain things that are simply hinted at in Blood and Sand, and there were plenty of things that were hinted. Yet the show felt off-kilter, ratio-wise about revelations and whatnot.
I know, I know... this was being done while Andy Whitfield (R.I.P., dude!) was recovering, so, why not get a little extra thrown in so you know better the characters you love and those you hate?
There are those moments that seem to take your breath away (like Batiatus' dad making a confession that seemed off rom how he normally was) and foot-stomping moments (just not on people's faces like in the show).
Though the excessive violence and sex weren't the only reason for the low rating, there instances where the grammar wasn't right. This show's English is set in an ancient Latin-based style, so why they threw out a couple direct ""yes""s are beyond me. Throws off the historically accuracy. That's why it alwasy sounds archaic, beat-around-the-bush when they're giving affirmatives (nowadays, a simple ""yes"" can be used for ambiguity, unlike then).
I still find it sad yet at the same time just how Animaeus ended up losing her life, but seeing the one woman you felt most hurt for gets it brutally, for that, I couldn't help but shed a tear or two.
Aside from all that, I do hope to see Gannicus in Vengeance. If he can kill while blindfolded, how would he go against Spartacus?",1338595200,,1549,4.827067669172933

There is so much backstabbing and manipulating to keep the greatest detective spinning. In the end we know the beginnings that we were unsure of, ooooohhhh that's why they act like that!

A boasting, womanizer yet on the sand he stands unmatched wielding two swords in the style of dimachaerus. You also see how crixus came in existence with the ludus of batiatus and earned his respect from his fellow brothers as he worked his way up the rungs of competitors. The same level of disgusting betrayal and unforgivable deceit follow all of those who look to further their fortune with the gods. One more monumental sight is seeing the great warrior and man, Oenomaus become the new ""doctore"" of the house of batiatus. Great acting, even more ridiculous action and just an all around interesting and exciting look into the ancient powerhouse that was rome.

4391795,4,B004JUJNNC,"This is the prequel to the series Spartacus: Blood and sand and revolves around Gannicus and the rise of the house of Batiatus. I have seen the original series and I recommend watching that first, as this spoilers some of what happens during the show. It's also really cool to watch after seeing that season and seeing the build up to the start.

It's defiantly not a kid's show at all. Debauchery, gratuitous murder and tons of cussing make up this gladiatorial story just like the first and second season. Some of the special effects are noticeable when people are getting killed, but trying to make someone's intestines being cut open is hard to do without making it feel unrealistic.

The acting is really well crafted, and the accents don't sound fake at all. I have always been a fan of the medevil-ish accents so I really enjoyed hearing all the dialogue in this season. The sword play, crowd, and setting all sound realistic and really pull you into the action.

Overall I really enjoyed watching this. I loved the first season, and it's nice to get some backstory on everyone from the first season and why they act the way they do.

In comparison, this series is much more bloody and explicit in its depictions of Roman decadence. I have no knowledge of how real the depictions of Roman life are but if it were like this, I could see how that civilization fell. Slavery, treachery and orgies are depicted. The story is engaging, but obviously not for everyone with the amount of gore and sex depicted. There are several featurettes, one where the wardrobe designer states she used ancient murals to get the show's designs. I don't know if all in the show is that researched, but some things, like the public bathroom depiction, are interesting indeed. So, I recommend it, especially if you had any interest in Gladiator or ancient Roman society.",1331424000,,987,5.861111111111111

4391803,4,B004JUJNNC,"This six episode prequel to Spartacus hardly seems forced or unplanned. I don't believe they actually did this just because Andy Whitfeld was unwell, I mean I'm sure he wasn't fit to shoot but the story goes they did this because they wanted to give Andy time to recover. To be honest, I liked this so much. We got to see a side of the king and his queen, the past, it was almost like Karma. Though it had only six episodes, the character build up was interesting and characters who seemed to have died in the first season came ""ALIVE"" in this prequel which was both astonishing and marveling at the same time.

Spartacus is such a guilty pleasure. It is extremely graphic, occasionally full of adrenaline, sometimes just plain gory and absurd, but for most of it one of the most remarkable shows I've seen on television ever. Every actor makes you believe this is the only realm they have ever existed in, you tend to forget it's not real.

4391809,4,B004JUJNNC,"Spartacus second season is not as good as the first one, but is still very entertaining, if you enjoy as I do this sort of overcharged pulp. The first season brilliantly ended with Spartacus and his fellow gladiators rising up and massacring their master Batiatus and escaping to become fugitives. The illness of star Andy Whitfield (regrettably, he ended up dying of cancer soon after) changed the plans of the producers, and instead of making a regular second season following Spartacus exploits as a rebel leader, they choose a short six episode prequel. The action takes place some years before Spartacus arrival in town, and we see how the upcoming Batiatus rises up to become the top lanista in Capua, against his main rival in the gladiator business, the very evil Tullius (Stephen Lovatt, who is great). To achieve this, he will rely, among others, on his top gladiator, Gannicus (Dustin Clare), originally bought to Tullius at a bargain price, as well as in Crixus and the trainer Oenomaus (the last two, seen in the first season).

If Batiatus seemed quite a mean man in the first season, here we see him fight against an even meaner man, Tullius, so we sort of end up sympathizing with him. For something that for obvious reasons was rushed into production, the script is rather good. As with the first season, Gods of the Arena is full of graphic violence and sex filmed with relish. A problem with the second season, in my opinion, is that Gannicus is not as an interesting character as Spartacus (we don't have much of a background story on him), so the focus of the season is on Batiatus, and actor John Hannah does not disappoint. While the machinations between the two masters are great, what is lacking is something as interesting in the sand.",1329782400,,1761,4.736156351791531
4391810,5,B004JUJNNC,"I was a big fan of Lucy Lawless in Xena: Warrior Princess so Spartacus was appealing to from the start. I wasn't a huge fan of Spartacus at first because I thought it was too slow in the scenes that weren't action orientated. While Andy Whitfield's charisma was certainly missed, I thought Gods of the Arena was an overall improvement on Blood and Sand.

What really made Gods of the Arena was the increased focus on the characters. It took a little while to get accustomed to the kind of storytelling that Blood and Sand used, but you really get a feel for the characters in this one.

John Hannah and Lawless make this prequel well worth your while. I don't generally like prequels and this looked like a load of filler from the start, but that ended up not being the case. The writers got over the loss of their lead actor, which generally cripples shows.

If you liked Blood and Sand, you'll love Gods of the Arena. If you haven't seen Blood and Sand, I still think there's something to be enjoyed about this series. It's an overall better series which might enhance your enjoyment of the first one.",1329609600,,1103,4.477611940298507

Just as good as Season 1 (Blood and Sand) in my opinion.  And I really liked the fact that they toned down the ""graphic novel-style"" comic-booky action scenes that bothered and distracted me in Season 1.  They still have the somewhat overdone 300-style slow-mo stuff, but that's not too bad.  Overall, the action scenes were very good and I was totally into the multiple-on-going stories.  The writers did a really excellent job.  VERY entertaining series.  Great acting, and I LOVED the addition of actress Jaime Murray's new character Gaia.  Both the character and the actress are AWESOME!!!  The sets, costumes, music, cinematorgraphy were all incredible.  And as is now the series' signature, LOTS of nudity and sex, so this show is for adults-only.  Highly recommend this 6-episode mini-season that is a PREQUEL to Season 1 (Spartacus: Blood and Sand), to all those who enjoyed Season 1!  And if you have not watched any of the Spartcus TV shows yet, you may want to watch Gods of the Arena first (Season 2) and then Blood and Sand (Season 1) afterwards, as Season 2 is a PREQUEL to Season 1.

4391816,5,B004JUJNNC,"Okay so you basically are required to watch ""Spartacus: Blood in Sand"" before you watch ""Gods of the Arena"" because this is a prequel series, note, NOT a second season as many people believe.

Yes, this was written to accomodate the late and great Andy Whitfield when he was first diagnosed with his condition, but it works out beautifully as we get a glimpse into the world inside the ludus before the Slayer of Theokoles, the Bringer of Rain ever stepped foot upon the sands! You see the characters that you know and love much differently- finding Batiatus and Lucrectia under the quake of his father, Titus, who is yet alive still, how Doctore became the wise and somewhat respected trainer of gladiators, and Crixus as he first trains to become a gladiator.  Lucretia finds an old friend named Gaia who lives with them- and futher question has to be asked: once you see the relationship between the two of them, does it make you think she was searching for the same type of friendship with Ilithyia? And you meet Doctore's wife, Melitta as well. Though more importantly, you meet the current champion of the House of Batiatus: Gannicus. This man is very different as he seeks at first, nothing other than the ""lazy"" life of a rock star- sleeping in, women, wine, the glory of the crowd and showing off, but it seems to me that he has a much deeper issue lying inside!

This world is DIFFERENT. Right?

The show is still fast-paced, high action, lots of blood, beautiful backgrounds and inevitably nudity and sex at every turn! It holds to the same standards as the other show hands down! And it ties in beautifully with the rest of the plots. Some characters return in the new season. It feels as if the stories we always wondered about were answered! Yet there are still many questions to be answered, once you watch this, you will find yourself excited for more.

There's only six episodes, but hang on. They're fantastic. And you'll have a few new favorite characters by the time you're done with it!",1328227200,,2007,4.626404494382022

The series focuses on Gannincus,  because Andy Whitefield (the original Spartacus) had cancer and unfortunately has passed. Although Gannicus is not as cool or entertaining as Spartacus, there is plenty of action and drama to make up for it. We come to hate Batitatus and Lucretia even more as we see their despicable rise to power.

If you like movies like 300 and Gladiator, I highly recommend picking up Spartacus Blood and Sand. In fact I would say it is almost a mix of 300 and Gladiator as many visual cues seem to come from 300 but the drama is more akin to Gladiator.

Much like Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Gods of the Arena had cheesy special effects, exclusively when it comes to gore, that eventually blend in and become a signature part of the show itself.  As in Blood and Sand Peter Mensah's acting is incredible.

I wish the producers would make a prequel to this prequel, there is such a wealth of good storytelling that it could be done.
My favorite character in this series was Gaia. She has a lot in common with her good friend Lucretia and they seem to have a wonderful backstory.

The non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma which ultimately claimed the life of title character Andy Whitfield necessitated this season, which served as a filler between the first season and the third - Spartacus: Vengance - with Liam McIntyre re-cast in the leading role.

Gods of the Arena deals with behind the scenes intrigue as Quintus Lentulus Batiatus attempts to emerge from his father's shadow and secure a higher position for the house of Batiatus in the Roman city of Capua.  Of course, the historical events portrayed in both seasons of Spartacus are used as a springboard to propel the story, and are only peripherally linked to the real-life events that lead to Spartacus' revolt in 73BC.

John Hannah and Lucy Lawless clearly relish their roles here, chewing on every scene of dialog as if it's their last meal.  The supporting performances are also suitably hammy and over the top - sublety has little place here - although Jeffrey Thomas brings suitable gravitas to his role as Titus, Quintus Lentulus' father.

The show is filmed in a heightened visual style reminiscent of graphic novels, with some of the backgrounds looking painted rather than organic.  Much has been made of the copious nudity in the series.  While there is plenty of flesh to be seen here, both male and female, it is considerably less, um ""in your face"" in season two.  The fleshly attraction here is in watching it abused in the fight scenes, complete with Matrix-style slow motion and CGI injuries of all sorts, including impalement and dismemberment.

Though this story is supposedly a prequel to the prior series, it becomes fairly repetitive and dull in the telling. How many times can you hear ""Jupiters C..k"" before you tire of it.
I felt the violence helped to dramatize the story in series one but it just gets repetitive and silly in this new season.
So while ""Gods of the Arena"" isn't horrible, it will prove to be a letdown for those who enjoyed the first series. The story feels forced and if you haven't seen the first season, some of the character introductions in this second set will go right over your head.

In fact, the show gives some much appreciated background to the main characters in the original series.  I found myself rooting for the same characters in this series, as I despised in Blood and Sand.  My ONLY complaint or criticism about this has to do with it's length.  Gods of the Arena is only 6 episodes long, which is great b/c you aren't left hanging constantly, and it moves more quickly.  TOO quickly, IMHO.  It almost seems like they try to tell too much in 6 episodes.  If they added another 2 episodes, they could have easily drawn it out and still made quality episodes, but as it is, parts almost seem glossed over or rushed in order to tell everything they wanted to in the limited timeframe.

I was skeptical about the Amazon Instant Video having never used it before, but it works great!  That's why I chose something like this for my first purchase.

4391852,5,B004JUJNNC,"Take the SPARTACUS series...go back a little in time...experience the turmoil that set the stage for the greatest revolt in history. There you have ""Gods of the Arena"". It suffers no loss in writing, acting, set/staging or any other factor. This series stands alone in all its glory.

So many revelations come to us while watching this series. Batiatus and Lucretia, while still rather despicable characters, display the human struggle to which we all fall prey. There are family squabbles Roman-style, inlaw situations, fertility issues, family business problems. Here we are enticed to feel some of the angst Batiatus has trying to be ""the good son"", to equal if not outdo his father's success. His marriage to Lucretia against his father's wishes is a thorn in his side. However, it is not his wife who causes him this pain. Lucretia while scheming, arrogant and sometimes cruel will support her man to the very end....and she does! Watching this family's dynamic is like watching a reality show today...mesmerising!

Perhaps, some wonder if the lack of the character of Spartacus himself would not weaken this series...absolutely not! In the footsteps of all those gladiators before and after him, Gannicus too takes up the sword. Excellently played by Dustin Clare, Gannicus gives us everything we hope for in a hero. He is physically awesome, easy on the eye and an in-depth, fully-rounded character in his own right. Gannicus is perhaps a conglomerate of all gladiators and in his plight we can follow that track on which they are proplelled by fate. To train, to fight, to live for the glory and blood and agony of the arena, that was the life of a gladiator. Few were given their freedom at the end of a glorious career. For most, it was a gift just to see another sunrise, to touch the soft skin of an erstwhile lover one more time, to take one more breath before the roar of the ravenous crowds engulfed them.

They are all here, Naevia, Oenomanus, Barca, the beloved Crixus etc. to draw us back into the thick air of the ludus, to lure us into the orgies and outright sinful fun of the house of Batiatus. New characters too, all insatiable in their own ways, rivet us to the screen, leave us longing to walk the rowdy streets of Capua beside them, to peek into their windows and out from under their beds....longing to be a part of the scene that was the Roman Empire.

Watch it....if you loved Spartacus, chances are you will get lost in this series too. Fantastic fun!",1321228800,2,2482,4.725173210161663

""Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena""
(Starz, 2011)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Note: this six-episode prequel to the popular but raunchy ""Spartacus"" cable series is best seen *after* viewing the original show - a ""previously on"" intro gives away the climactic ending to the first series, and though the backstory provided in ""Gods Of The Arena"" is nice, new viewers will be bummed by the spoiler aspect. That being said, this series kicks ass. Here we meet the House of Batiatus, a fictionalized version of a real Roman gladiator school where the famous rebellion led by the slave known as Spartacus began. As in the first series, there's plenty of gratuitously gratuitous and graphically graphic violence and only slightly less graphic and gratuitous sex - the sex scenes are far less disturbing than the highly stylized, slow-motion mauling, slashing and beheadings that take place in the arenas... But it is certainly a titillating view of ancient Rome. Although the show is unapologetically salacious and depraved, it's hard not to get sucked in by the soap opera-meets-snuff film drama, and Lucy Lawless (who I remember fondly from ""Xena"") has the best role of her career here. Can't wait for Season Three! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)",1320624000,,1343,5.620689655172414

4391870,5,B004JUJNNC,"It took me a while to get into 'Spartacus: Blood and sand', while I enjoyed it the first time I watched it, it was only after discussing it with friends of mine that I found it more appealing and started overlooking what I had originally perceived as flaws in it. Flaws is one way to say it, while the extreme violence and gratuitous nudity do not scare me, they do not seem relevant to the story and only make it difficult to watch at home having a 4 year old who enjoys watching TV with his parents...

Well, Gods of the Arena follows the same formula of its predecessor, and why shouldn't it if it proved to be a success?

Originally conceived as a flashback episode for season 2, the creators decided to expand the flashback and make into a 6 episode miniseries after Andy Whitfield, who played the role of Spartacus, had to leave for treatment on his Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. By creating a prequel to the first season, they would allow Andy to complete his treatment and return on time for the second season. Sadly, Andy passed away back on September 2011.

If you enjoyed Blood and Sand, Gods of the Arena will be a treat. In this prequel we basically get to learn how all characters from season 1 ended up in the situation they are at the beginning of the series.  The house of Batiatus is led by Titus, Quintus' father and Quintus is still friends with Solonius, here we get to see how they became rivals. The series is basically about the rise of Gannicus, the champion of their ludus and all the evnts that led to the season 1 when Spartacus arrives. I do not intend to spoil anything else because if you liked the first season, this one is a must. On top of all that, add  special appearances by Jaime Murray and Temuera Morrison.

The video quality is great for a DVD presentation, it is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and looks great when upscaled in my BD player. Audio on the other hand, while not lossless as in a BD, is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 which delivers a more than acceptable audio presentation. If you are playing this in an HD home theater, this is nothing that a little twitching on your HT can't improve.

The bonus materials include production design documentaries, convention panel and bloopers. I am still not fond of the presentation of the discs on the digibook-type cardboard cases, it feels cheap and discs may get damaged if not kept properly. With season 1, the discs came stained with glue from the cardboard because of the way they were packed, fortunately this did not happen with Gods of the Arena, but I believe they can do a better job packaging these.

If you have not seen either of these ('Blood and sand' of 'Gods of the Arena') I would suggest to start with 'Blood and sand. While 'Gods of the Arena' is a prequel and should stand on its own, I found it more enjoyable once you know the characters from 'Blood and sand'... just a thought

Now let's wait and see how they do with 'Spartacus: Vengeance""",1319673600,,2963,4.472222222222222

I can be a pretty masculine guy at times, so obviously a show like this has held my interest from the get-go, but surprisingly this story appealed to my artistic and creative side as well. True, the series is over-the-top violent, and portrays a very raw and graphic period of human history, but there's some beauty in it all; not only are some elements of the story fact-based, but the visuals are presented in an artistic and expressive way, instead of just some perverted collection of beheadings and sex scenes. Many times, I find myself emotionally bonded to both Spartacus in S1 and Gannicus in S2, celebrating their triumphs and lamenting their torment. All in all, both seasons of Spartacus change the game in terms of a television series, and if you can watch a few episodes and go without flexing in the mirror for the rest of the week, then you're of a stronger mind than most (myself included). Bring on Season 3!",1319673600,,1087,4.44

If you're new to Spartacus and wondering whether to watch this or Blood and Sand first, you have to watch Blood and Sand due to major spoilers in the first and last episodes. But really, it's money better spent anyways.

If you're here reading reviews for Gods of the Arena, there's a good chance you loved the original -- Blood and Sand. I know I did. Campy but it had a great storyline and such depth of character. Raw and occasionally overdone but definitely evocative. I didn't know what to expect from this six-episode ""prequel"" arc. I was hoping to see Oenomaus fighting as a gladiator for the House of Batiatus, but this happens after that. There's really very little in the way of plot beyond Quintus and Lucretia's scheming ways. Having seen Blood and Sand, you pretty much know who will die and how things will turn out so no real suspense there. And Crixus' portrayal really missed the mark in my opinion.

To make up for the lack of real substance and character depth, the show resorts to more racy sexual material to fill the time slot. I doubt most people would complain about this, but it feels like the writers focused more on raunchy sex scenes than the story. A shame because Gannicus had such promise and as a viewer you never really know much about him.

So three stars. Decent, not amazing.",1319414400,7,1445,4.593023255813954

Far better than the 2005 TV series ""ROME"" for blood, gore, violence, nudity, sex, cussing, perversion, greed, betrayal, and most of the things you watch a gladiator film for, ergo, ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"" is definitely adults only, not meant for the prim and proper goody-two-shoes crowd, and if you're a Victorian era prude or Bible thumping bigot, you should avoid this DVD.  On the other hand, if you're wanting some great, enthusiastic acting from men and women, good & evil, with realistically simulated sex with nude actresses and nude actors, rhythmically gyrating and building up the crescendo of ecstasy with climax, public exhibition of rape, along with bloody gore and dismembering sword fights where the blood flows like coffee at the corner greasy spoon, then this DVD series will satisfy.  The only negative thing about this DVD series is the TV voice-over advertisement at the end of each episode that reminds the viewer to set their TiVo or DVR for each Friday episode on STARZ (cable channel), as if you were watching it live on cable TV.  ""Gladiator"" of 2000 with Russell Crowe was meant as more of a drama without focus on the harsh reality of the depravity quite as much as ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"" is more than happy to clearly share in graphic detail.  This DVD is easy to take seriously, enjoy, and appreciate for delivering exactly what you expect from the title, box cover art, and brief description.

I understand that leading man Andy Whitfield tragically passed away from cancer. While he was battling the illness, Starz made Gods of the Arena as a prequel to the series. It consists of six episodes.

All that said, I thought Spartacus: Gods of the Arena was a thrilling, extremely well-produced epic mini-series. The story concerns the city of Capua before Spartacus arrives. There is a gladitorial arena being built (which is used in the first season, Blood and Sand) but for now we see the bouts held in a very makeshift venue. There is plenty of exciting action, including both violent fights as well as action of a romantic nature. John Hannah is commanding as Batiatus. Lucy Lawless as his wife Lucretia is sexy and delivers a great performance.

With first rate production values (much like Starz series Camelot) and engrossing, deep storytelling (much more so than Camelot), Gods of the Arena is riveting.

4391879,5,B004JUJNNC,"**WARNING:EXTREME VIOLENCE AND GRAPHIC SEX**

Before there could be a Season Two of SPARTACUS:BLOOD AND SAND, the marvelous actor Andy Whitfield succumbed to cancer - a loss to acting as well as his family. The producers, therefore, concentrated on a prequel, before Spartacus' arrival at the ludus of Quintus Battiatus, and have provided the fans of the first season with a solid backstory of some of the inhabitants of Capua and the gladiatorial school at its edge.

Battiatus is a young scion of a lesser noble family eager to climb the ranks, but held back by his hopelessly outdated - and straightlaced - father. Battiatus the Elder, for the first part of the series, has been off to the coast regaining his health, and Quintus (with his wife Lucretia, played to decadent perfection by Lucy Lawless), has been enjoying a run at being master of his own domain. I have no doubt that at least some of what goes on here was probably pretty close to the mark - Rome was a notably vice-filled civilization, after all - but there is a gratuitous amount of violence, blood, and completely over-the-top sexuality encompassed within this (relatively short) 6-episode series. There is a satisfying filling-out of personal histories, however; the young Gaul, Crixus, who in Season One was a real scenery-chewer, is shown arriving at and being schooled in the life of a gladiator; Animaius, who in Season One was the 'dottore' or schoolmaster, of the gladiators, is, in this prequel, just returning from serious injury and hopeful to rejoin the Brotherhood; and the weaselly future secretary to Quintus, the slave known as Asher, portrays how he became the pariah of the school.

Adding to all this is Quintus' continuing battle of wits with a supercilious - and more powerful - local Capuan, and enough decadent sexual shenanigans to keep the most bored viewer entertained. This much complete degradation is usually not something I would watch with any dedication, but the level of acting - and I do appreciate historical drama also - as well as the extremely well-written storylines - kept me involved throughout. I won't deny I covered my eyes during some of the more gruesome scenes, but first-rate performances from everyone involved and clearly well-researched authenticity in costuming and language made this a worthy follow-up to Season One.

An insert announces a sequel Spartacus Vengeance for early 2012.

Some of the special features explain how this six part collection came about.  There were some planned flashbacks for a second season which was put on hold due to the actor playing Spartacus' illness. A six episode commitment from STARZ allowed that material to be fleshed out.

Frankly this is not intended for children. The language is coarse, the nudity and sexuality plentiful, and the blood flows freely. I found the bloodletting gratuitous in the first episode but less so as the story unfolded.

It was nice getting the background history on how Blood and Sand came about too-- but this was awesome.  I stayed up until 2am knowing I had to get up for work in the morning because I just couldn't stop watching it! I am so, so happy I purchased this!!!",1318896000,2,406,4.259740259740259
4391883,5,B004JUJNNC,"It ain't easy pulling off an ancient civ television series without being cheesy. By some lucky chance Starz has managed to make its Spartacus series work on multiple levels just barely missing the cheesy mark. Blood and Sand shocked me. Vicerally violent, highly erotic, and filled with political and social machinations that keep viewers coming back for more it's fast become a favorite in our household. But as Season 1 reached a bloody climax it was hard not to sulk at the misfortune of some of the greatest villains on television. More! We wanted more! That's where Gods of the Arena became an oasis in the desert.

If you haven't watched Blood and Sand, please do not watch this first! Yes, this is the story of the rise of the house of Batiatus but I would encourage folks looking to give the series a try to be patient and watch Gods of the Arena after seeing Season 1. Why? As you watch Gods of the Arena a multitude of the little questions that don't matter in the scheme of the overal Spartacus story-arc are answered. Why is Crixus such a die-hard gladiator? How did Ashur get his injury and become the Dominus' errand-boy? When did Lucretia first seduce Crixus? And many more of those nagging little things that aren't key to Spartacus' character development but fans of the series will enjoy getting the lowdown on.

I was not a big Crixus fan through-out the first season. He was interesting but I couldn't quite buy his motivations. This prequel season is the season of Crixus and managed to take a relatively one-dimensional character richly compelling. In contrast the previously mentioned but never seen Gannicus introduces a character we will meet in the upcoming Season 2 and gives us enough back story to look forward to seeing him in future episodes. Ah, but it really is the villains who make this show utterly skin-crawling, yet delicious! Seeing a softer Lucretia suffer at the cruel tongue of her father-in-law while she is truly devoted to her husband really sets the tone for the growing tension. Enter the scheming, licentious Gaia, her dearest friend and the start of the raunchy sexual escapades the house of Batiatus becomes known for. Meanwhile, the seeds of the rivalry between Batiatus and Solonius are planted as best friends find themselves at odds.

While one might call this series of six episodes filler and it is certainly not required watching to enjoy Spartacus as a series I really think it serves to round out character development that didn't fit into the first season while comforting fans waiting for Season 2. With the passing of the Andy Whitfield, the title star, it's a bit difficult anticipating the next season. If the cast--including the title character's new casting--and crew continue to bring the same intensity, visual brilliance, and delightful dialog it is certain to continue wowing fans and disgusting others with the sex and violence.",1318809600,2,2899,4.864372469635628

So far it's worked. My team's 3-1. Nah, all superstition aside, these are great shows. The action is non-stop. It can be a little too sexual at times, but that's why they invented fast forward. Other people think that's the best part of the show, but I love all the action, camaraderie between the gladiators and the gore. And the language too. I love how they always say ""Jupiter's c**k!""

4391894,5,B004JUJNNC,"Awesome. Just awesome. If you - like yours truly - thought that the amazing series ""Spartacus"" was dead after its mesmerizing predecessor, ""Spartacus - Blood and Sand,"" think again. I am happy to say that ""Spartacus - Gods of the Arena"" triumphs in every way -- it is as good as it gets.

The second installment of this fantastic and gruesome series takes us to the world of Spartacus before his arrival to the house of Batiatus. In the first episode, ""Past Transgressions,"" we are briefly taken back to the future that we know, which we saw in the conclusion of ""Spartacus - Blood and Sand."" We also witness how the House of Batiatus slowly, but surely, takes form. We also meet Batiatus and his wife Lucretia (the magnificent John Hannah, and Lucy Lawless, respectively), as well as Oenomaus (the astonishing Peter Mensah), before he became the feared gladiator trainer or Doctore, who at the time was married Melitta (Marisa Ramirez). And then there is Gannicus (Dustin Clare), who was the reigning champion of the House of Batiatus, and the envy of his rivals in the trade. In addition, we see how Batiatus learns the gladiator business the hard way, and how he becomes the cold-blooded gladiator owner and person that he is. In the remaining five episodes, we meet more interesting characters, such as Titus (Jeffrey Thomas), Batiatus' father, who, to his son's displeasure, wants to re-take control of his gladiators. We are also introduced to the beautiful Gaia (Jaime Murray), Lucretia's close and calculating friend. Finally, we meet some of the regulars from the previous season: Crixus (Manu Bennett), the mesmerizing future champion; Solonius (Craig Walsh Wrightson), Batiatus' best friend and future foe; and Crixus's girlfriend, Naevia (Lesley-Ann Brandt). In the end, of course, the set is ready for Spartacus - Blood and Sand,"" as Batiatus consolidates his power, despite his father telling him, ""You really did not want this life, did you?"" and his worst enemy predicting, ""There will be an accounting, Batiatus, for this and everything that follows.""

""Spartacus - Gods of the Arena"" has all the elements that made the first season successful. It has grandiose cinematography, great production design, plenty of sex and nudity, lots of cursing, intrigue, and, best of all, a great story. While I'm writing this, it has been announced that Andy Whitfield, who played Spartacus in ""Spartacus - Blood and Sand,"" sadly died at the early age of 39. He's a hard act to follow, for sure, and lets hope that Liam McIntyre, his replacement, continue the series success with ""Spartacus - Vengeance."" The DVD includes a glimpse at the Starz Studios' set of Gods of the Arena, an anatomy of a scene, a segment on the production design of the show, arena bloopers, an interview with Lucy Lawless, and much more.

4391895,4,B004JUJNNC,"Without Andy Whitfield to play the role of Spartacus in Season 2 in the Starz gladiator hit series, Starz turned their attention to show how Quintus (John Hannah) and his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless) Batiatus turned the House Of Batiatus into the most important Ludus in Capua. Welsh born Australian actor Andy Whitfield brought the Spartacus character in Spartacus: Blood And Sand- The Complete First Season to life in this Starz series. Sadly, Andy was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in March 2010. With immediate treament, Andy came out cancer free in 2 months, only to have it return later. Andy lost the battle with cancer when it returned the second time and he passed away last month on September 11, 2011 at age 39. My deepest sympathy goes out to his surviving wife and 2 children.

As Andy went through his cancer treatments, Starz put Season 2 of Spartacus on the back burner and instead created this 6 part history of Quintus and Lucretia Batiatus, Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena. The characters are all here from before Spartacus' arrival in Season 1. Quintus Batiatus (John Hannah), his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), Quintus close friend Solonius (Craig Walsh-Wrightson), Quintus' gladiator instructor (Peter Mensah), the future champion gladiator- Crixus (Manu Bennett) with many of the slaves from Season 1. Turing back the clock to when all of the characters were younger, explains everything about their ambitions in Season 1.

In addition, there are some new characters added to the story- Quintus Batiatus' father is ruling the House Of Batiatus in this Gods Of The Arena, and the performance Lucy Lawless gives as the daughter in law is simply superb. Her ambition knows no boundaries. Lucretia (Lawless) has a best friend Gaia (Jaime Murray) who knows that it's who you know to climb the social ladder in Capua and what you can do for them. Lucretia learns a lot from the ambitious Gaia. The star gladiator is a fit, handsome, hard drinking Gannicus played by Dustin Clare. This character is truly fun to watch, and I hope Starz brings him back in a future episode. Crixus is a new gladiator who wants to defeat Gannicus and be the top dog, but all the attention he craves seems to come mainly from Lucretia. This entire prequel showcases the driving ambitions in the House Of Batiatus and is thoroughly worth viewing to get your finger on the pulse of the characters. There are also several other characters in this prequel that add to the growing number of people, that Quintus and Lucretia have to remove to reach their goals.

As for Season 2 of Spartacus, Starz has already re-cast 29 year old Australian actor Liam McIntyre as Andy Whitfield's successor. After seeing Season 1 and this prequel, I am looking forward to the continuing action packed saga of Spartacus and the House Of Batiatus.",1318377600,4,2823,4.8893528183716075
4391896,5,B004JUJNNC,"I absolutely loved the first season of Spartacus, and I wrote a review of it as well, and when I heard about the prequel 'short stack' of 6 episodes I was very much looking forward to seeing it and was not disappointed.

Because the story line of the first season was a bit complex with primary, secondary and tertiary plots and characters interracting, and it was so riveting it made you want more, it was natural to have some burning questions that went unanswered when Season 1 ended...

Like what in the world happened between Quintis and Selonius that made them such bitter enemies?  Well, you know the old saying that there is a fine line between love and hate?  In this case, it's a matter of your best friend will most definitely be your worst enemy if you have a bad enough falling out, and that's what happened between these two, big time.

There was the question about why Doctore, who was such an honorable man, was so steadfastly loyal to the house of Batiatus in the midst of this dishonorable behavior.  In the prequel, we learn about that as well about the wife that he mourned.

And, of course, the mystery of Crixus and Lucretia.  Did he at one time love her and then slowly grew disillusioned with his lot in life as her secret gladiator lover and that was why he turned his sights onto her nubile and lovely personal maid?  Well, while it seemed like a romantic notion to think about, that ain't even close to the way their relationship started.

I will say one thing, though.  As grasping and greedy, perverse and manipulative as Quintus and Lucretia were throughout Season 1 and the prequel, they had one redeeming quality between them and that was that regardless of what threatened to tear them apart, they wouldn't allow it because they genuinely loved each other.

I don't know if it was that they recognized a depth of evil in the other that complimented their own so well that they naturally meshed together, or if the two were even capable of something as fine as love, but whatever it was, they had it and they remained wholly committed to each other no matter what.

While I haven't heard any sort of scuttlebutt about the second season of the show, I do wonder if the character of Gannicus will be re-introduced into the rotation since the gladiators have fled from the house of Batiatus after the revolt, if for no other reason than to offer haven to Doctore until he can track down Ashur and give him the justice he so richly deserves.

I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and I was so delighted with this 'short stack' of episodes so that the questions I had about the characters and their back stories were answered.

For anyone who enjoyed season one, or who just enjoys a really gritty, intense and riveting story, this is for you.  It's wickedly good fun!",1318291200,3,2788,4.546
4391897,5,B004JUJNNC,I loved sparticus 1 & 2 will have to see if I like the next one. Its too bad the main actor who played sparticus died I really felt he was a good actor and perfect for the show. This one is a prequil to the first without spartacus and it really got me going hope you enjoy it as much as I do.,1318204800,,292,3.578125
4391898,4,B004JUJNNC,"Any review of Starz's mini-series prequel ""Spartacus:  Gods of the Arena"" must start with its tragic inspiration.  Andy Whitfield, star ""Spartacus:  Blood and Sand,"" had to take a break before filming the second season to battle cancer, a battle that he tragically lost.  Starz decided to film this six-episode prequel in the hopes that he would be back to film the second season.

Despite this sad foundation, in many ways this season is better than the first.  In large part that is because the story largely focuses on Batiatus (John Hannah), the gladiator factory owner who will train and ultimately betray Spartacus.  In this prequel, Batiatus is merely the custodian of his father's school and chafes under his father's conservative thinking.  The school is second-rate, but Batiatus and his friend Solonius (Craig Walsh-Wrightson) are ambitious men.  One of the treats of this mini-series is to watch the birth of the rivalry between Batiatus and Solonius that moves so much of Season One.

John Hannah turns Batiatus into a wonderful character, an ambitious cockroach of a man whom you can't help loving just a bit because . . . well, because he's played by John Hannah.  Batiatus is married to Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), a Roman Lady MacBeth if there ever was one.  Watching these two climb the social ladder is a terrific joy, particularly as they are aided by Gaia (Jaime Murray), a hedonist even by Roman standards.

We also learn the backstories of several of the gladiators.  Oenomaus (Peter Mensah), the instructor in Season One, is still a gladiator but has lost his status as champion due to the wounds from his legendary fight.  Instead, Gannicus (Dustin Clare) is champion as well as a charming drunk.  Crixus (Manu Bennett) is a mere recruit but wants nothing more than to take Gannicus down . . . that is, until Lucretia turns her eyes on him.  And on and on.  These back stories are handled well - good scenes but the action never gets bogged down in too much exposition.

For there are only two reasons why ""Spartacus:  Blood and Sand"" became a surprise hit for Starz:  blood and sex.  There is enough death and dismemberment in ""Gods of the Arena"" to satisfy even the most jaded ""Saw"" fan, and, well, let's just say that there's more full monty here than in ""The Full Monty.""

At only six episodes, ""Gods of the Arena"" moves quickly through its paces, but the amount of story feels right.  Here's hoping that this cast and crew has seen all the tragedies that it will face and that only bright, bloody days are in store.",1318204800,2,2542,4.751141552511416
4391899,1,B004JUJNNC,"I received Spartacus: Gods of the Arena through Amazon Vine for review. As an action film fan, I was curious. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it, as I couldn't finish watching. There aren't many films that I'll stop watching purely because of content, but after almost five solid minutes of stylized violence and gore straight from a horror movie, I had more than enough. Yes, the gladiator sport was a bloody one, but it's not something I want to see glorified. It was violence just for the shock value. Still, I tried fast-forwarding through the bloody scenes to get to the talking/plot. But there doesn't seem to be much. I haven't seen any of the rest of this series, since I don't have the Starz channel. And I was immediately lost. Unfortunately, this show just wasn't for me.",1318204800,2,779,4.571428571428571

There is a lot of extras which help explain how they did some of the special affects in the arena and the general atmosphere. I highly recommend the dvd.",1318204800,,302,4.375
4391901,5,B004JUJNNC,"Prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand, this is a six part miniseries set in ancient Rome in the days of the gladiators. Unlike many reviewers, I have never seen Spartacus, so I am going to take this review as a first time viewer of this show.

Quintus Batiatus is ambitious. He wants power. In his father's absence, he gets a taste of that and is anxious to ascend the social and political ladder through his various dealings. His promising gladiator, Gannicus, shows great promise and virtual invulnerability in the arena (he bests one opponent blind folded for crying out loud). As Quintus maneuvers, there are other forms of maneuvering going on with his own slaves as infighting between the Gauls and the rest of the group comes to a head and the treatment of slaves as sex objects gets a bit out of control.

As someone who has never seen the rest of the story, I can tell you that this miniseries is entertaining as a standalone story. It also makes me want to see the Blood and Sand. The action is intense and the story is gripping. As you may have guessed by the review title, there is a lot (and I do mean a lot) of graphic violence and sex scenes. The language is also such that it would probably beat out a locker room. If you are sensitive to any of those things, be careful with this one. If you thrive on those, this is great.

The DVD quality is excellent. The special features are pretty much in line with other sets although admittedly, they have bloopers and I always enjoy those (and not all DVD sets have them).",1318118400,2,1530,4.418439716312057

4391903,5,B004JUJNNC,"Good. Unclean. Fun.  This series isn't going to win any awards for it's thought provoking content, but if you like good, old fashioned, gratuitous violence and other adult content, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better.",1317772800,,227,5.135135135135135
4391904,4,B004JUJNNC,"Thank goodness for the pause and rewind buttons. I found myself often having to go back during a scene wondering if I saw what I thought I had just seen. SPARTACUS: GODS OF THE ARENA is sure high on the shock level counter. It's a constant festival of bloodletting and sex and don't get started on the language. It is all amazing and shocking..even more so than the original SPARTACUS series.
I have to commend STARZ for continuing this popular series despite the illness of the star Andy Whitfield, who recently passed away. Rather than replace Whitfield as SPARTACUS or end the series, the brought it back as a prequel. Rarely do prequels work and it's even more rare to have the same actors portray themselves in the prequel.
In GODS OF THE ARENA, we learn how the House of Batiatus began to emerge from a second rate gladiator school to find fame and glory. SPARTACUS ended in a brutal bloodbath and many main characters were murdered off in the series, but all of them are back in GODS OF THE ARENA. We learn more about each gladiator and slave and Roman citizens. There is a new star gladiator called Gannicus played by Dustin Clare. Manu Bennett as the Gaul gladiator Crixus is not recognizable as first with his long hair and savage nature. We learn how Ashur became handicapped. If you are a fan of SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND, it's really exciting to go back in time and see how it all started.
There is plenty of sexy and frontal nudity-both male and female. It's a bit unnerving that for a while The House of Batiatus tries to seek the favor of powerful men by having their slaves and gladiators in a sort of Roman brothel. Nothing is sacred here and be prepared to be shocked at every corner.
It's great to see Quintus and Lucretia Batiatis back from the dead played again by Lucy Lawless and John Hannah. They seem to relish their roles as the devious and ambitious but childless couple. I enjoyed watching this international cast trying to all speak like ancient Romans. John Hannah's Scottish accent was always evident in mild form. The actors try to form a common language despite their diverse backgrounds.
It's important to mention again that the fight scenes are extremely graphic as blood and severed limbs careen across the scream almost in a 3-D effect. Blood spatters in the spectators in the arena. Gladiators die in horrible ways and it is all part of ancient Rome. How accurate is what we are seeing? Certainly, the ancient Romans loved their galdiator spectacles. Did the rich and slaves alike talk  constantly in vulgar and sexually-explicit words?
GODS OF THE ARENA is certainly a visual work of art not to be missed by fans of the original series.",1317772800,,2676,4.633684210526316

4391909,4,B004JUJNNC,"When news of a prequel series to Spartacus: Blood & Sand would be produced due to the illness of star Andy Whitfield (who sadly passed away), I feared that it would be a shoddy and quickly produced affair.  Thankfully, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena is far, far from that, and in some ways even outshines Blood & Sand.  Detailing the evolution and bloody rise of Batiatus (John Hannah) and Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), as well as delving into the origins and backstories of Oenomaus (Peter Mensah) and Crixus (Manu Bennett); Gods of the Arena delivers the goods in terms of stylized bloody action and drama.  Hannah and Lawless are spectacular and do great jobs further fleshing out their characters than they did in Blood & Sand, while newcomer Dustin Clare shines as prized gladiator Gannicus.  All in all, while Gods of the Arena suffers from some of the same shortcomings that Blood & Sand did, such as the sometimes ridiculously fake-looking CGI, it is a wonderful mini-series that does great justice to Spartacus as a whole, and is a more than worthwhile endeavor for fans of the first season of the show.",1317686400,2,1105,4.769633507853404
4391910,4,B004JUJNNC,"Picking up at the conclusion to the first season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand, the six-episode series presents the ascension of the House of Batiatus as the passing Quintus Batiatus' life before his dying eyes.

The series shows the societally impotent Quintus' growth from a groveling schemer to the head of the powerful Batiatus lutus of the series' first season. We get to see Quintus' acquisition of Crixus, as well as that eventual House Champion's rise from lowly slave to powerful gladiator. The character is nearly unrecognizable from the clean-cut image portrayed in the first season, with that shift in appearance part of the character's own development. The initiation of his affair with Lucretia is also shown, with her need to produce a son for Quintus overriding her relatively puritanical view of extramarital activities.

The clear star of the miniseries is Dustin Clare as the charismatic House Champion Gannicus. A hard-drinking, oversexed, lazy gladiator, he becomes the focus of the conflict between Quintus and one of the city of Capua's power brokers. Unwilling to lose his greatest galdiator, and thus the only clear means to achieve some semblance of status above his lanista status, Quintus endures beating, humilation, and other abasement repeatedly due to his refusal to sell Gannicus to his social superior. From his reluctance initially to his increasing boldness as backing down clearly is anathema to him, as is humility and humbleness, he suffers for his ambition.

The gem of the series if Jaime Murray as Lucretia's corrupting friend. From her loose morals to her gold-digging pursuit of a husband, she transforms the House of Batiatus from just a lutus to the carnal house of the series' first season. While she couches her moves and machinations as directed to aid the rise of the House of Batiatus, it's clear that she is really just attempting to meet her own drug-addled desires. And we viewers are the beneficiaries of her lack of moral compunction, from the bloody single combat in the lutus as a demonstration of gladatorial quality to the orgies that are the end result of her sexual liberalism.

The digital images on the DVD rival the quality of my Blu-Ray of the first season, and at lower cost. The special features are respeactable for the most part, with nice behind-the-scenes shorts on such things are choreographing the arena fight scenes, for which the actors had to train relentlessly. The lowest part of the features is the one thing I look forward to the most: the bloopers. While there is a blooper reel, it is just about the most dull set of outtakes I have ever suffered through. It is the first I have never laughed at at all. It's really not funny and the set would just as well have left it out.",1317600000,4,2757,4.909871244635193
4391911,5,B004JUJNNC,"Absolutely the best series ever produced. A combination of fighting in the arena, training, loyalty, corruption, sex, and scandals. Brilliantly paced, incredibly compelling and fascinating, with extremely graphic slow-motion violence and blood sprays, steamy sex scenes, and sexual innuendos pertaining to the male anatomy. The villains are delightfully evil, the women exude lust, and the gladiators are vicious killing machines and are perfect EYE CANDY.
The entire cast is superb.
Excellent!!",1317513600,3,495,5.985915492957746
4391912,5,B004JUJNNC,"The CGI is great. There's the mansion and gladiator quarters built right on the edge of a high cliff, the walls melting into the cliff's walls. Just awesome. And there's all that skin. The gladiators are also called upon to sexually service their masters. And there's all the detail from Roman times that catches you by surprise.

During one discussion, two characters are walking through a narrow alley when they suddenly pull up and decide to sit down on what appears to be a bench on one side of the alley. They continue their discussion. One of them is eventually handed an oblong rod of some sort that he inserts between his legs and kind of wipes upward before returning the rod to the slave that handed it to him. The rod is then dipped into a tank of water and handed to the other character. He also uses it to do something between his legs before handing it back. The two characters get up and continue their stroll and conversation.

Wait a minute? What just happened? Oh, now I get it. Yuck.

There are a lot of yuck moments in Spartacus. Guys get heads sliced off. Hearts torn out. Eyes gouged. But it's all done in an exaggerated CGI style that makes it more riveting than gross or even violent.

In one gladiator match, a contestant gets his chest sliced, blood sprays out, then, NFL Films style, the camera zooms in on the spray of blood as it flies through the air. The crowd noise goes silent. The picture shifts into slow-motion. And the instant your eyes are captured by this splatter of blood, the crowd noise roars back, the image begins moving in real time and the blood splashes all over people in the front row of the stands.

Ohhhhh!

I actually had an involuntary physical response -- a jolt -- to that sequence.

But the CGI and action scenes are all fluff. This is a show about politicking. About power. About attaining power and the consequences of reaching for it. The characters, plot and acting are good enough that you will get lost in the story.

But you'll also be wishing for more of that CGI gore.

Yuck.",1317254400,,2041,4.479784366576819
4391913,5,B004JUJNNC,"I hate doing reviews on movies, only because it's such a personal thing; either people like or hate any particular movie. No room for realistic opinion, on the whole; one may often get a reaction based on cultural belief systems, rather than a simple movie entertainment factor. People will disagree to agree, but it's still a personal thing. Some people simply go Ape and any review gets a real shattering...... So, be it.

This movie was hot on my list after the Stars 1st day release on Netflix. When Amazon had a preorder I can bet I was one of the very first to preorder; because I hit the check availability every day until it showed up!

This was not a disappointment, both series was a wee a bit mixed up, having released the aftermath before the beginning, kinda bent the whole show. :) However, having both Blu Ray disks, sitting down to an action packed adventure was worth it! This is how I imagined the era, so for that it worked very well for me; perhaps not for others. Tops my list for favorites!~ Don't like it, too bad!

Excellent achievement in concept, design and execution...

4391914,5,B004JUJNNC,"This show is so addictive. I watched the first episode of Blood and Sand and was hooked. Hearing that Andy Whitfield had cancer and has now passed is truly sad. He was a great actor and now a cult figure, he must surely be among the Gods now. As for Gods of the Arena. More sex and violence, more twists and back stabbing. It was great to see how the characters became who they are in Blood and Sand. Gannicus is awesome... Lucretia is all and some, a devoted wife and a devil in disguise.... and Batiatus just cracks me up with his anger and spouts of vengance. His choice of words are so powerful and yet so funny as I've never heard anything like it before....'words fall from his mouth like sh** from my ***' Classic!

4391916,4,B004JUJNNC,"I recorded the first season of ""Gods of the Arena"" when it aired on Starz various channels.  Be prepared to throw out all your visual inhibitions and memories of old Roman movies.  As I viewed the parade of nudity, sex and stop-action violence, I thought to myself, ""This is probably the way the Romans lived. We just hadn't adjusted our 20th century vision to imagine the all-out, nose to the wall, lives they lived.""  After the while the blunt language got funny, since every other word was ""f**k"" or ""c**k.

My first impression was a sell-out to attract viewers.  But as I watched the episodes I began to see there was really a STORY here.

When I saw that Sam Raimi was involved, it was no surprise.  He never let anything get in the way of his movies, no matter how ridiculous or gory.",1316908800,,790,4.444444444444445
4391917,1,B004JUJNNC,"This was just bad.  The first season was excellent, had a story, a plot, great acting,and was based on historical events and characters (yes, there was a Crixus, and yes he did lead with Spartacus until they parted ways).  Gods of the Arena felt like the fill-in series it was, almost pointless, and ended the way we already knew it would.  It also gave John Hannah an opportunity to shed his likeable character from ""The Mummy"" series, and unfortunately it worked.  The extensive and continued dropping of the F-Bomb was distracting from what little story we could follow, and was hardly shocking after the first 30 minutes.  Just annoying. And yes, their continued use of ""Apologies"" was tedius.

I look forward to the next season, unfortunatly without Andy Whitfield.  Hopefully the next season will have an actual storyline and do a better job of creating the excitement and passion that was Rome.",1316908800,3,901,4.8881578947368425

The main actor Andy whitfield was very good and one of the reason to watch, but with him gone (may he rest in peace),it seems John Hannah and ""Zena"" can't carry the series.

The thought, ""Enough already"" crossed my mind for sure. But, over all, being someone who thoroughly enjoys anything taking place in ancient times, the action packed fight scenes and the way you come to care about some of the characters was very enjoyable from beginning to end.

4391923,5,B004JUJNNC,"Season two of Spartacus ~ Gods of the Arena arrived a few days ago and I tore into it hopping it would not be a letdown from Season one. From the first frame in episode one to the final fadeout in episode six I was taken beyond my expectations and my hopes we not dashed on the rocks below the Lunista of Batiatus (as is the fate of one delicious character in season two.)
  A great story line is the key to the wonderful series and a solid foundation for this outing. Wonderful in all aspects from direction to art direction and costumes it is a Roman orgy for the senses.
  The actors are all top notch with outstanding performances by Lucy Lawless and John Hannah at the top of the list of startling and moving work by the huge cast. And not a single one of them is hard on the eyes. The name of the game in casting the gladiators for the most part is ""Good Skin, Small nose, big muscles."" And both Dustin Clair as Granicus and Manu Bennett as Crixus fit the bill AND they are great actors to boot.
  Another stand out for me was the beautiful and titillatingly wicked Jamie Murray as Gaia. What a fabulous actress and what a role she has to play. She adds so much spice to this stew of blood and bones. I also found Josef Brown as Aticus to be a great addition to the cast. What heat and passion he brings to the role of the lover of the always wonderful Antonio Te Maioha as Barca. The outcome of this bro-mance is a stunner. And one must not overlook the immense talents of Peter Mensah as Doctore. His layered and deeply felt portrait is a keystone performance in this his second season of the series.
  The entire show was a treat and it goes without saying that though we have lost the original star of Spartacus Andy Whitfield who was brilliant and made season one sing, I am looking forward to season three.

4391933,5,B004JUJNNC,"Caught this on Netflix. Huge fan of Season 1. The creators absolute genius taking what was to be flash back episode and giving us six episodes of twist turns and debauchery. To write an extensive review on a six epsiode prequel would be a huge spoiler. We do know how some characters end up, this is a prequel, but the story lines are excellent. It's not gratuitous porn, but very adult in violence and sex. The twists and turns these episodes take are good. It is six episodes so the story moves fast. Our champion Gannicus could have used more of a back story, it makes it hard to accpet him as champion just cause he is and watching how Crixxus came to be is a little heartbreaking. Lucretia and Quintas is at there finest, this is actually their story. And Gaia, Lucretia bff in this we just say she is a bad influence and she speaks you find self listening cause you never know what she is going to say or do. And other new charaters introduced does pave the way for alot more story telling.

4391935,5,B004JUJNNC,"Okay, here's a pre-review for the DVD I just pre-ordered.  This mini-series is basically a stop-gap.  Andy Whitfield had to leave the series due to an ongoing battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (*UPDATE* A battle which, sadly, he lost on 9/11/11. RIP.)  His status was in doubt for some time, which delayed production of season 2 for several months.  In the interim, DeKnight and co. took a flashback sequence intended for a season 2 episode and expanded it into a prequel mini-series.  Quick and dirty...and, as it turns out, pretty darn good.

Good: The tale of the beginnings of the House of Batiatus 2.0 is right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/dp/B003PIUC02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a>, especially the last three episodes.  We see the events and circumstances setting up the beginning of _Blood and Sand_, and discover....well, no spoilers, but another member of the H-o-B turns out to be every bit as cunning and ruthless as is its Dominus...and there is a VERY good reason for it.  Hannah and Lawless are even better this time around, and that's saying something after their stellar performances in the last series.  Dustin Clare delivers a fine performance as champion gladiator Gannicus.  The surprise standout this time around, however, is Peter Mensah, who brings a hitherto-unsuspected humanity and warmth to his character Oenomaus.  Mensah and Clare have great on-screen chemistry, and I hope we'll see more of it in _Spartacus: Vengeance_.

Bad: The first couple of episodes were a little weak and slow-paced; the story takes awhile to ramp up.  Also, this time around they tried a little too hard; the sex and violence did in fact become gratuitous in places.  By the third episode, during yet another round of flash-cuts between the orgy in the House and the bloody battle in the arena (or elsewhere), I was yelling at the TV ""WE GET IT ALREADY!""  Also, oddly, the price of this 6-episode set is higher than the 13-episode Blood and Sand.  What's up with that?

Ugly: No more new Spartacus until 2012.

Five stars, minus one-half each for being not *quite* as good as Blood and Sand, and the inexplicably high price.  All in all, however, well worth picking up on blu-ray even after watching it first-run.

* UPDATE 7/6/11: The price suddenly dropped almost by half; still a bit high, but now reasonable for a mini-series.  Putting the half-star back, and rounding up. :)",1308960000,6,2496,5.19

Gods of the Arena is a show of blood and violence, politics and raw sexuality that avoids the cliche exclusively heterosexual and shows the truth of how the men during the Roman Era had sexual relationships with both men and women and didn't think anything of it. They didn't title it, nor did they politicize it, they just did what felt good. It was an age of decadence and indulgence and this Season expressed it all.  I love the look of this show, visually it is very beautiful, in addition the story is engaging and the loose morals of the upperclasses is just commical at times.

Gannicus was a great character to have and was not as annoying as Spartacus was in Blood and Sand. This prequel to the first season presents an abundant amount of missing and unknown information from the first season which provides better understanding to what is going on, who is who, why they were or were not there in the first season and much more..The nudity, sex and goofy language is there just as it were in Blood and Sand, but I must admit I was not as put off by it as I was with the first season. By now the obscene, yet rather odd, language is quite enjoyable and laughable where as in the first season I was not to favorable of it. Naked people are all over the screen yet again, most are quite pleasing to look at though. I read that the blu ray release will contain extended episodes too much for tv as the first season did which is always a nice plus to have. I will be purchasing this on blu ray once it is released and will be purchasing Blood and Sand so that I can go back and watch it again. I'm sure I'd enjoy it much much more the second time around. I hope I've been helpful..

But jeez, what's with price of the 6-episode series being almost as much as the 13-episode original season? And that's even with Amazon's 30% off...",1299283200,92,408,4.680555555555555

8432003,5,B004JUJNNC,"The discs come in a plastic and cardboard contraption that is like a little book. It opens like a book and has sleeves for the discs. The discs play fine, but I'd rather have a plastic snap case.

I've watched Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand multiple times. This is adult entertainment at its best. The look and feel are unlike any other series I can recall except Rome, which is another great series.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. If you like sci-fi you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2057,5.1467065868263475
