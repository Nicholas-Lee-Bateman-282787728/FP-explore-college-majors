6871875,4,B00QJ9N1VQ,"""The Liberator"" is a biographical drama covering the life of Simon Bolivar (Edgar Ramirez), the 19th-century revolutionary and political leader who sought to free Latin America from Spain. Ramirez delivers a multi-faceted portrayal of Bolivar, a man born into privilege who was also fighter, lover, and scholar.

 Bolivar fought more than 100 battles against the Spanish Empire in South America, riding more than 70,000 miles on horseback in military campaigns that covered twice the territory of Alexander the Great. He was instrumental not only in freeing Latin America but also in establishing the independent republics that sprang up after the Spanish departed. He served as president of both Peru and Colombia, and he organized in southern Peru a new republic, named Bolivia in his honor.

Location photography is spectacular and includes Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall. History buffs will notice parallels to George Washington, whom Bolivar greatly admired. A trek over the Chilean Andes in the middle of winter to take the Spanish forces by surprise will remind viewers of Washington's army crossing the Delaware River to attack the British.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include an introduction by Gustavo Dudamel, composer of the film's musical score; making-of featurette; and theatrical trailer.  The film is in English with Spanish subtitles. There is also a dubbed Spanish option.",1426118400,6,1412,5.429223744292237
6871876,4,B00QJ9N1VQ,"I just got my copy, and rushed to watch it.  I was really turned off by the first 30 minutes: Bolivar having sex with his mistress, then his wife and then a prostitute in Paris.  What was the point?  As someone who went through primary school in Caracas,  I memorized Bolvar's official biography, and was quite startled by the film's ending, which, I have found out, is a not too subtle reminder of Chavez own paranoid certainly that Bolvar had died by poison, not from tuberrculosis, getting to the  point of having his body exhumed and examined!  N  superb acting from Ramirez and the rest of the extremely large cast. Dudamel's score?  Exquisite.  The landscape cinematography is simply awesome.  I assume that, since the film opened in Caracas, it has the imprimatur from the government in power.  As an antidote, I recommend the Manuela Saenz biopic, also in film.  For the record, this is NOT Blu-ray but a regular DVD.",1426032000,15,925,4.7125
6871877,4,B00QJ9N1VQ,"FOLLOWS MUCH OF THE SPIRIT OF SIMON BOLIVAR, BUT SKIPS AND ALTERS OCCASIONALLY TO FIT THE STORY IN A REASONABLE RUN TIME

***SOME HISTORICAL CONTEXT INCLUDED FURTHER BELOW

Many North Americans will be unfamiliar with the struggle for independence fought in South America, of the brief unification of a huge part of that continent long before the United States spanned from sea to sea, a war in-part to end slavery decades before our own, a concept of free American identity not specific just to North America.  This biographical tale of Simon Bolivar is also a condensed story of a war for independence from Spain.  It is NOT a perfect historical film.  In the two hour run time it's just not possible to do such a massive epic a complete justice.  It tends to focus mainly on Venezuela and Colombia as the beginning of his crusade.  Strict historians will find issue with a little change or reorder here and there.  A little ""glossing over"" is done also to perhaps maximize the inspirational quality of the film.  However, I felt the spirit was still maintained in the runtime allowed and this is a magnificent corridor for people to gain interest and investigate the complete or real history.  It was filmed on location in stunning areas of Spain, Venezuela, Colombia and many other countries.  The acting, cinematography and musical score are all exceptional.

THE STORY:  I will leave most of this for the viewer to discover.  However, it begins with Bolivar fleeing a coup attempt in 1828 (nearly the end of our tale).  Bolivar then remembers in flash back the death of his mother (his father already gone) and he runs to the arms of Hipolita, a black slave who plays an important part in raising him through childhood.  We skip forward to about 1800 where Bolivar attends the Spanish court and meets the woman he will marry.  He woos her and convinces her to return with him to the vast family holdings in Venezuela.  He belongs to one of the most important families there.  It can be a little disjointed, but this begins his story and describes the events leading to his participation in the struggle to free Venezuela (and eventually other Spanish provinces in the new world).  Through his unique experiences, his personal losses, being raised in part by Hipolita, and the teachers around him, Bolivar will be uniquely prepared to lead a revolution of independence.  One which would stretch an area twice as vast as Alexander the Great (I didn't do the calculation, that is a quote from the opening credits).  It was a revolution much inspired by the American and French revolutions themselves and eventually drew soldiers from many parts of the world.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  Simone Bolivar is often called the George Washington of South America.  He was inspired greatly by our revolution.  Although the producers claim they are trying to portray a realistically imperfect man, they still gloss over some important differences to maintain the inspirational tone of the film.  Bolivar believed devoutly that his republic required a much firmer and centralized government with a president appointed for life.  I understand he explains this difference in his writings due to the graft, lack of education, and wildness of the land which made it much more difficult to govern than the American states.  The disjointed flashbacks make it feel as though he fled as a boy when he went to live with Hipolita and that he spent the rest of his childhood with her.  This fits the spirit of the story in that his relationship with her was as a mother.  He called her the only mother he ever knew.  However, that is only a partial depiction of a more complete truth.  He still had the privilege of his family holdings and tutors while Hipolita aided in his care.  I understand there was a brief period before the death of his parents where he actually stayed with Hipolita.  The movie also depicts Bolivar as having virtually no military experience when he joined with General Miranda fighting in Venezuela.  In fact, he attended the military academy Milicias de Veraguas.  A few years later he went to Paris where he witnessed the coronation of Napoleon.  This is something that also likely impressed him, but the movie sidesteps and depicts him avoiding Napoleon.  The film does not really delve into the abdication of Bolivar and also intimates a different death than history traditionally ascribes.  The making-of feature explains that new research was done while filming the movie and they decided to go with a more mysterious ending which they claim ""could"" be true.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Though the film cannot be long enough to do the history complete justice, the attention to cinematic detail is terrific.  The accents vary appropriately according to region and class.  I did find them interesting to note (like the accent at Spanish Court).  I am not a regional Spanish expert so I cannot say for a fact.  The period costumes were gorgeous and the locations stunning and mostly authentic (even the Andes crossing).  If you can make some allowances for history, this is a fantastic film.",1426032000,17,5092,4.881118881118881

I'm from the Caribbean and know the history of Simon Bolivar and found it surprising that they showed Irish soldiers helping him win the revolution, when in fact Simon Bolivar took refuge in the Caribbean after being injured in battle.  In the caribbean he was nursed back to health, provided with boats, weapons, rations and many soldiers (Haitian and Jamaican) who went back with him to South America to liberate that continent.  So yes the movie was good but the important fact concerning the Caribbean (black) influence on South American liberation is still a hidden fact.  The Bolivarian revolution was not just one of power and influence but one of ideas, its time those ideas were expressed in film making as well... half the truth is just as bad as telling a lie.",1445385600,,853,4.704697986577181

The movie explores/hints at in the lack of respect for property rights and law in Latin America and it shows the internal conflicting tensions within the society-racial, religious vs. Enlightenment secular, rich vs. poor, etc.

The period costumes in this film appear to be spot on.  It is really interesting seeing the Soldier's Uniforms and the women's dresses.

With only two years of High School Spanish, I found the movie easy enough to follow.  Subtitles ""on"" is still recommended.  Great movie.",1441929600,,752,5.065040650406504

6871970,2,B00QJ9N1VQ,"The movie looks good, seems the money spent by PDVSA and the venezuelan government was put to use in a competent fashion al least on the cinematography, score and some of the acting.  The presentation of history is pitiful though and has a clear agenda in trying to compare Chavez with Bolivar, both being persecuted by the oligarchy, the final scene is an outright lie as Bolivar was never captured and killed by a reactionary army, he died of consumption traveling from Bogota to Caracas.  Better read the book ""El General en su Laberinto"" by Garcia Marquez to understand the final days of Bolivar.  The battles are so poorly presented and they also lie in the presentation, it is a well known fact that both battles of Boyaca and Carabobo were won almost singlehandedly by the English Legion (not Irish Legion as presented in the movie) which was the most disciplined element in Bolivar's army, in the movie the participation of the two batallions of the legion are minimized and the battles are presented as a mob affair in which elements of batallions are freely intermingled and no sense of order, discipline or even tactics are presented.  Bolivar also never met the crown prince of Spain Don Fernando the Seventh as it is suggested here, Bolivar also dis not represented the interests of the lower classes and peasants but the creole landed gentry that wanted to get freedom from Spain so they could engage in free commerce with England.  So in the end England paid for the Latin American revolution and got new markets that were banned before by the Spanish Empire.  I hate political propaganda and specially using an iconic hero of Latin American independence to prop a socialistic government that is mismanaging and ruining its country such as the Venezuelan Chavista movement, for the Maduro regime this is money well spent because most of the audience is gullible and will buy the message of the movie.  I hope someday some film will make justice to the figure of Simon Bolivar.",1438560000,3,1991,4.804093567251462

6871972,4,B00QJ9N1VQ,"Nice reminder about important history. Beautiful and pleasant to watch despite some gruesome battles, corpses, etc. I am quite glad that I watched it. The ""making of"" special feature was helpful. For example they explained that they wanted to air controversial doubts about the usual story that Bolivar died of TB and (presumably) were not just being sensationalistic. So, lovely scenery of South America and period costumes and furniture, etc. Dialogue was adequate, but true enough not up to the fact that Bolivar was a great thinker as well as a remarkable warrior.  Probably true enough to history in most respects to spark the memory or introduce one of history's truly great figures to the world outside of South America.

Flawed in many respects and one should be prepared to overlook them and enjoy or avoid the film if this sort of thing is a deal breaker for you.

The version that I saw was 119 minutes and evidently some critical material was left on the editing room floor. Towards the end it was difficult to say who was fighting whom. There really needs to be a director's cut. It is a shame to issue a film of such potential interest this way. But that said the film makes its points and is worth watching. Personally I would have gone to the history books in any event for authoritative perspectives, because this is very important world history.

There have been criticisms that the dialogue was not great. I would say sure, but it was okay as epic films go. How great was the dialogue in Lawrence of Arabia, or the history for that matter? Still one would want to watch Lawrence and appreciate it for what it is.",1438128000,,1631,4.652777777777778

The final liberation battle scenes do conflict with what I learned about the amount of deaths and the tone of the battles. The final scene about him being killed as opposed to the more stablished notion of him dying out of sickness seems to be done for pure dramatic flair or to push some conspiracy agenda which in my opinion does not seem to be well supported.
Overall, not a bad movie, and definitely one of the few I have seen about the emancipation of south american countries from the Spanish empire, but the dramatic background and idealized view of Bolivar detracts from what could have been an amazing opportunity for a more historically accurate film.",1431820800,,907,4.710691823899371

6872035,3,B00QJ9N1VQ,"I am Venezuelan, and the movie is not true to the history 100%. It skips the most important part of the story, which is when he Liberated Venezuela. The most important battles that lead to the independence of the rest of the continent are not portrayed. The movie received funding from the Venezuelan government, which I found out after I watched the movie and understood why the reiteration of the word ""Revolution"" is used so much. Bolivar is a Venezuelan hero, but communists in power have distorted his original ideas and turned him into this so-called ""beautiful revolution"" ( Revolucion Bonita) face.

The movie, however, is very well made. Acting is impeccable, costumes, music, scenery, and cinematography is award worthy. Very pleased with Edgar Ramirez's performance. But I cannot help but think how much did the Venezuelan government really had to do with the editing and production. I'm giving this 3 stars because it's a good movie for a person who didn't grow up with the story of bolivar taught in school. For a South American, specially Venezuelans, not good enough",1428710400,3,1081,4.972375690607735
6872036,5,B00QJ9N1VQ,"It is a great movie which shows part of the life of the greatest man in Americas: Simn Bolivar. As Venezuelan, I am really proud with the quality of this production. If you want to know more about latinamerican history, watch this movie.",1428624000,,237,4.534883720930233
6872037,5,B00QJ9N1VQ,"I really don't know how accurate this movie was about the small details, but I did appreciate that it gave me a better sense of the way that the revolution for independence worked in West South America.
The first part there wasn't much action, and my husband lost interest- he likes to see people killing each other or he's out of there- but I appreciated the backdrop for the development of the story.  It is a well shot movie and many of the scenes, especially when they crossed the Andes- was just incredible.
It is in Spanish with English subtitles.",1427932800,4,553,4.53

8691531,5,B00QJ9N1VQ,"Simon Bolivar (1783-1830), known as The Liberator because of his acts in South America, was a Venezuelan political and military leader who led the South Americans to be independent of the harsh dictatorial Spanish rule existing at his time and played a significant part in establishing independent states of Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama. The film states that he fought over 100 battles against the Spanish Empire in South America. He rode over 70,000 miles on horseback. His military campaigns covered twice the territory of Alexander the Great. His army never conquered  it liberated. Hence his title.
The film shows that he was born to an exceptionally rich family in South America and was educated abroad. It tells how he came to have an enlightened anti-Spanish view, his early marriage, the death of his wife and the effect it had on him, and how he organized many thousands of South Americans, mostly peasants, to fight the Spanish. The film depicts a few of his battles and his love affairs. It also tells what some of the South Americans thought of him after his success and how they acted based on these thoughts.
Bolivar wanted to establish a single large South American country, but he had opposition because of the self-interest of some of his generals who wanted to lead parts of the country. He was strongly anti-slavery. He liked the spirit of the US revolution but felt that the US was wrong in its attitude to slavery and believed that government in South America, unlike that of the US, required a firm hand. It is claimed that he died at age 47 due to tuberculosis, but the film has a different story believed by many but not all historians.
It is an important film because it is a significant part of world history. The acting in the film and the film itself are very good.",1516838400,,1820,4.7413249211356465
