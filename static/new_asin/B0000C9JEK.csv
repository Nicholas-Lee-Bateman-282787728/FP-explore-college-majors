1916949,3,B0000C9JEK,"Rather than review all the phases, I figure it's best to do the first since you'll be starting off with this one anyway :)
The 'Final Fantasy' direct game series (meaning 1-11) has always been the basis and the best. The spin-off games have always been recieved with mixed opinions, since they can be quite different.
However, the Final Fantasy Animation have always been recieved very poorly. The first anime called ""Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals"" was in 4 parts and took place after the FF5 video game...the translation of names was inconsistance w/ the later released US video game, needless to say it was pretty bad. We all remeber Sony's attempt to show off the PS2 CG movie...which was terrible.
However, FFU is actually the 3rd and best atempt for an animated FF series. As the games it is a completely new story, but with classic FF elements (Chocobos, Summon Spells, Charcters leave & join the party) so in this aspect it is pretty good.
The English dubbing is also pretty good, though Yu's voice actor always sounds like he reading his lines and they should have used someone else in my opinion (that's quite annoying!).
The story will be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys the games, I would base the character types (like Fungus and other weird one) on a FF6 & 9 level = NOT for everyone as some are silly, I do not believe Amano created them, but that's the overall flavor.
This is somewhat like Xenogears animation (mix of CG & Cartoon) but overall not quite that much...but again you get the idea. 90% is animated with only a few scenes and small fractions with some CG special effects like Kaze's Demon Gun (AKA Magun in US).

Overall don't expect this to be based directly on a FF game. I reccomend it for die-hard Squaresoft/FF fans.
The Japanese version would fir nicely in the ""Teen"" rating, but sadly the US version is slightly toned down and thus younger children would enjoy it :(",1084060800,3,1905,4.619469026548672
1916950,2,B0000C9JEK,"If you are buying this because you are a fan of the games, go away.  It puts shame on the Final Fantasy name.  Shame on you!!!!  The dubbing is terrible, the animation is crude, and the characters are annoying.",1081036800,2,210,4.333333333333333
1916951,4,B0000C9JEK,"Here is a very short review. I mainly wanted to make sure this anime doesn't get a bad rating due to a few who didn't like it. I give it 4 stars because I really enjoy watching this story. AND - I really like the characters. You gotta love the chocobo always trying to eat Ai's hair. And isn't she just the cutest when she's mad?
Anyway. I like it. So that's my review.",1075852800,4,369,4.0
1916952,4,B0000C9JEK,I love this series. This phase is one of the best the storyline really takes shape and is really well done.  I only gave it 4 stars because I had to return the dvd 3 times due to an error on writing the dvd itself which made it rather hard to get into it until they all worked.  But a very well done series,1074643200,3,306,3.765625
1916953,2,B0000C9JEK,"Final Fantasy has the makings of a pretty good show, it really does. But as I understand things Square kinda ran out of money before they finished making the show. There really should have been more episodes, but there arn't. The premise for the show is reasonably good and the characters are pretty good too. It's just that not much happens and when it does everything happens way to fast. The first 20 odd episodes are kind of slow to develop the plot and then in the last episode they throw what should have been about ten episodes of plot development at you in about a minute and a half for a finale which, while spectacular, is really not all that good and poorly resolved. My advise is to not bother buying the show and to borrow it from someone else.",1071619200,3,757,4.375886524822695

They are attacked by a stange man....er...boy named Count Tyrant and his deathlords. They must survive and find there parents before the Count finds them. The series is full of action and comedy, and the characters are wonderful. Even if you hated all the FF games, give this anime a check, you'll be glad you did!",1064880000,3,486,4.534090909090909
1916956,5,B0000C9JEK,"Yo, I have the honor of rating this incredible series first!  If you have ANY serious love for the FF series then you'll love the TV show.  The story-line has been done to death, but it IS a pretty tight series.  Anyway, this series is about twins (a 12-year-old boy and girl) who go out looking for their parents after they disappered into another world known as the ""inner world"".  Ai and Yu (the twins) go into an abandoned subway station where they find a ghost train that takes them to various parts of the inner world, where there are plenty of new friends and enemies to meet along the way.  They meet Kuruki Kaze, (which means ""Black Wind"") who has forgotten his memory and can summon beasts with his Demon Gun, Lisa, who keeps her past a secret and can read the energy of living things and uses mysterious powers, Ru, a mysterious girl who can transform into a wolf with the sight of her reflection, and various other characters such as Cid, Chocobos, and other things from the FF games.  I cannot some up this entire series, but trust me, it's worth getting.  This is only the FIRST box though, so box 2 is still out there on the internet somewhere.  I fell in love with this series after the first episode, but this is only for die-hard FF fans in my opinion.  I hope my review was helpful!

1916984,5,B0000C9JEK,Im a huge Final Fantasy fan so the series was a must for me . Keeps enough of the franchise without turning it into a fan made series meaning there is still an amazing story and characters without them been replicas of the characters from the games .

1916989,2,B0000C9JEK,"Final Fantasy Unlimited: The Complete Collection is a five disc DVD box set that contains all twenty-five episodes of Final Fantasy Unlimited.  This set was released in 2005, after the seven single DVD releases came out.

Each disc in the set contains five episodes.  For the second through fifth discs, the only menu option is for languages.  In this menu, you can choose to either have the English audio, or to have the Japanese audio with English subtitles.  On the first disc, you can choose the languages, you can see the DVD credits, and there's a link for ADV Previews.  In the ADV Previews, there are trailers for Azumanga Daioh, DN Angel, Full Metal Panic? FUMOFFU, Rune Soldier, Gatchaman, and Madlax.

I found the lack of special features in this box set to be rather disheartening, especially after discovering through research that the seven individually released DVDs did come with bonus features.  For whatever reason, when ADV released this box set, they decided not to include any of those bonuses and just put out a bare bones box set.

By the time I finished watching this set, I was rather disappointed in how the series turned out.  In the first episode, it seemed like the series had a lot of potential.  However, as the episodes went on, it became clear that the series followed a rather predictable formula in the episodes, and that the character of Kaze was definitely a ""deus ex machina"" (a ""chair of the gods"").  Between my disappointment in the series, as well as my frustration in the lack of special features, I was rather disappointed in this DVD box set overall.

However, if you are a fan of Final Fantasy Unlimited and are trying to collect the series on DVD, I would personally recommend trying to track down the seven individually released DVDs.  However, if you don't mind the lack of special features, then you might have an interest in this box set.  If you decide to purchase the box set, I would recommend shopping around to find the best deal for it that you can.

In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that I was given as a gift.",1289865600,,2102,4.610215053763441
1916990,5,B0000C9JEK,"This is a must for anyone who is a FF freak!!
My son buys anything with the name FInal Fantasy on it, and he has discovered that there are over 60 FF games, remakes, etc.
This is a fun cartoon with similar characters. A good mini movie.",1271203200,,236,4.042553191489362
1916991,2,B0000C9JEK,"I have been a Final Fantasy fan since version 1 of the game came out for the NES. I played through all the other FF games and loved each and one of them. Just because they are amazing developing games, it does not mean that they would do well developing movies or anime.

  I got the movies through Netflix so I can watch them with my kids when I get home from work and relax. In the beginning of the story, it gave some scenes of war and destruction. The startoff was slow and have some mysteries like who is the adult woman hanging around with the two kids and who is the man with tha ma gun that always seems to show up when they are in trouble. It is very interesting to see what kind of summon comes out of the ma gun on pretty much every single episode, but the summoning takes like 10 minutes. Most of the creatures seems to be from FF7.

  As the series go on, it reveal more information about some of the main characters. Toward the end, the plot is revealed but yet the end is disappointing because the watchers are wondered ""what happened"". It is like going to a roller coaster ride where right toward the end, it just stop and everybody get off.

  I originally got the first DVD from the Block Buster bargain bin, and that should have been a flag that this is not really that good. Watch it if you have time to kill, otherwise you might be better off watching other anime like Full Metal Alchemists, Kenshin, etc.",1248998400,,1426,4.213235294117647
1916992,5,B0000C9JEK,"I understand what people have been saying about it not being what they expected. Expectations greatly influence how we perceive products to be. However, this series is incredible. Though it is sometimes cheesy, it manages to have just that right amount to make it wonderful. The music is great, and the characters hilarious. There is not much in common with the FF game series, but when you take this as a separate whole, it doesn't matter. This series is fun, entertaining, appropriate for all ages, and great, as long as you aren't expecting another ""Advent Children"" out of this.",1208390400,3,582,4.888888888888889
1916993,1,B0000C9JEK,"I went through about half of this series expecting it to go somewhere, and it never did.  Although the animation was pretty for the first two or three times you see Kaze, nothing ever really progresses plot-wise for the first couple dozen episodes.  The characters never show any development, and nothing is ever properly explained.

I wouldn't waste your money or time on this series.",1206316800,,385,4.892307692307693
1916994,2,B0000C9JEK,"Watching this series, I get the impression that the company was hoping to cash in on the huge following the Final Fantasy games enjoy. I have a hard time imagining it getting too much attention otherwise.

There was so little effort put into this anime, it felt like torture. The constant use of repeat footage drove me insane. Seeing the exact same Kaze summoning sequences over and over and over again, with slight changes in background and ammo color, just felt pathetic. This happened to a couple of other characters and it felt like you were just watching the same episode a dozen times instead of a new one. The plot was shaky and uninteresting and only a few of the characters  seemed worth watching.

Add to this the lackluster script and voice work that all anime fans hate to see when a series is officiall dubbed and released and you have a pretty big mess. The two main characters sounded like they were constantly whining and the rest of the cast either wasn't acting enough or were exagerrating their character so much, it made it even worse.

What really hurt me here is that this series could have had a lot of potential. What I've seen of the game series, it really is something special. This idea could have been something good, but instead turned into a cheap attempt to cash in on someone else's work. If I were you, I'd spend my money on something else.",1200441600,2,1374,4.528225806451613

1916997,3,B0000C9JEK,"This is a decent series, but not awesome. It is only marginally related to the Final Fantasy world, and it tends to be very repetitive.",1186704000,,135,4.44
1916998,4,B0000C9JEK,"Final Fantasy Unlimited is an unusual anime side project of the popular Final Fantasy RPG series of video games. Taking elements from the video games, it weaves a new story that stands on its own.

The animation is good, though somewhat bland compared to other titles from the same era, but I personally enjoyed the light-hearted series as a whole. Unfortunantly, the dub is a little shakey. Most of the characters are voiced decently, but some (especially Yu, one of the main characters) just bothers me. Considering this was dubbed in '03, I was very disappointed in ADV's voice work even if this is a niche title. For those that it bothers, they can switch to the original Japanese soundtrack with subtitles. It also seems that the series was cancelled in Japan before completion so, while the story is given a ""proper"" ending in the last episode, it doesn't feel as satisfying as it could have been.

If you're looking for the bonus material included on ADV's original DVD releases of the series, then the slim box set isn't for you. I'm not sure what is on the original DVDs besides some production art galleries and commentary with the voice actors, but if you would like to have these extras the old DVDs are still availible readily (although you'll have to cough up $20 or more per DVD).

I'm disappointed in the bare-bones release and the poor quality of the dub, but otherwise this is an enjoyable title at a pretty good price. Final Fantasy Unlimited is an interesting experiment that doesn't always get it right; not everyone is going to enjoy it but, to be honest, every time I see one of Kaze's summons (there's usually at least one an episode) I remember why I like the series.",1180656000,,1692,4.6521739130434785

1917000,4,B0000C9JEK,"First, I would like to say that these cartoons do have English language voice tracks (I couldn't find that information anywhere when I was shopping).  On to the actual review...

Initially, I was disappointed with this cartoon series.  The voices of the female protagonist and the main antagonist are brazen and irritating (although you do get used to them).  The plot is slow to develop, and the first few episodes consist primarily of an unpleasant little girl proclaiming ""I hate it here!"" in response to various oddities.

However, the episodes become more interesting as the series progresses.  Characters are actually given obstacles to overcome, and personalities become multidimensional.  There is some element of intrigue among the enemies, and much mystery surrounding the main characters.  Humor blossoms from the characters' burgeoning humanity, and suddenly all the elements of a compelling story are present.

Patience, however, is still required.  Those of you have played final fantasy will recall the long animations associated with each summon monster.  Summon monsters play an important role in this cartoon series, and the drawn-out animations become repetitive.  Moreover, the character who uses the summon monsters recites a tedious incantation before each use.  (You'll have the phrase ""soil is my power!"" stuck in your head after a few episodes.)  These repetitive interludes did not ruin the cartoons for me, however.  I kept my perspective by reminding myself that commercial breaks are longer and more irritating, and I have in the past watched many shows with commercials.

Some viewers have complained that this series is untrue to the Final Fantasy label, but (thematically speaking, at least) I would strongly disagree.  The themes of friendship, teamwork, and self-sacrifice that pervade the Final Fantasy series abundant; expect touching gallantry and heartbreaking martyrdom.  Also present is the age-old theme of history recurring in immutable cycles.

Some questions in this series do remain unanswered at the end (of course I won't spoil it with details here!), which is slightly disappointing.  I feel the series is less thorough than the games in ""tying up loose ends"".  However, there are enough interesting plot twists toward the end to keep the viewer's interest.  I genuinely believe those who are patient enough to watch the whole series will be glad that they did.",1176854400,3,2409,5.351063829787234
1917001,4,B0000C9JEK,"this anime series is really entertaining. it is not the best that i have ever seen, but i love final fantasy and i love anime, so i like it alot. the series really picks up towards the middle to the end. the begining is a little lacking, but the later on the series is very satisfying.",1173312000,2,285,4.107142857142857
1917008,5,B0000C9JEK,this was brought as a gift for my daughter who loves final fantasy.  she screamed when she saw this.  she watches the dvds almost everyday since she got them.  so i guess that means that the purchase was a good one.  i had a fast delvery and no problems.,1168300800,6,254,4.122448979591836
1917009,4,B0000C9JEK,"This is a great anime, will keep you entertained and guessing until the last episode.  But be warned, the story line and action are a bit slow.  And the main character's summoning gun takes at least 10 seconds... just for him to fire it. Sigh.  But don't let this keep you from buying this product.  It is still a great anime, hope you enjoy.",1154995200,4,342,4.296875
1917010,4,B0000C9JEK,"Ok... this series isn't exactly like the Final Fantasy games, but the elements are there. For instance, you have chocobo's, you have cactuar's, you have the summoning of Guardian Forces (which by the way look really cool), you have character's which have too much power for their own good, and a journey. This journey is that of Ai and Yu's search for their parents, where they are accompanied by Lisa Pacifist, a woman who possesses the cool power of Kigen Arts. During their journey, they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland (I won't say anymore, I don't want to spoil too much of the plot).

I have this product rated as 4/5 stars, but actually i think there it should be 4.5/5 stars. I really enjoyed this series, but I dock it .5 points because the time length ADV gives the series to be is inadequate. They say it is total 625 minutes, where actually each episode is 22min 45 sec, thus 22.75 min * 25 = 568.75 minutes long total length of series.

Anywho, if you like final fantasy, i suggest watch this series.",1153267200,7,1028,4.491978609625669
1917011,2,B0000C9JEK,"The series' main flaw is the repetetiveness of the storylines, somehow even though I watched the episodes back-to-back I still felt deja-vu. The plot wouldn't advance for episodes, and I think this is what caused the ratings to plummet, they took too long to flesh out the plot so, the fans grew bored. Also, what contributed to my feelings was the showing of several identical slides in every episode! That said, it still was a fun watch, the bonds shared by the twins, Chobi, Lisa, and the enigmatic Kaze are really interesting and often funny(when not pertaining to Kaze of course). Also, the villians were not malevoloent, just mischevious which only served to affirm my opinion that this anime is more oriented towards kids. I'm not sure about the mechanism used to rate if it's final fantasy or not, but I think the fact that they had crammed all the plot twists in the last episode contributed to the criticisms, I think if the animators took some of the sub-plots out and focused on the storyline this series would've been good, instead of just decent. As it is, it's still fun, and at a bargain price; if you have nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it!(2.5 stars)",1147132800,7,1178,4.641148325358851

1917013,1,B0000C9JEK,"No wonder it got canceled. If you where expecting a beatiful story line like ones you play or something a unique story like ff series usually does. Well guess what your not gonna find it here. Usually i would atleast compliment the graphics here but the main charactes seem more like background sketches that the animators didn't really care about. Oh and the digital graphics. The digital graphis where nice at first til they got extremely repetive and they seemed to be forced on to conclude the episodes. The only thing that i can't really critisize for the very little fact the he it never fails is the soundtrack. It seems that the only one who actually cared for this project was Nobuo Uematsu which he never fails to bring the soundtrack to life with the Final Fantasy series. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting something final Fantasish. But, it said on the box it was based in the final fantasy world. So now the final fantasy world is called wonderland? I didn't know that final fantasy was inhabited by a bunch of patato sack looking people. I can't belive i was even curious to buy the whole box set. Im disapointed for the fact that i actually trusted on square enix to provide atleast a good story line. If your curious of the anime it wouldnt be better to just watch the last Cd. The writers drag you threw all the anime wondering the characters past yet they manage to unveiled their secrets in the last episodes near the end. The series was meant to be more than 26 episodes but it sucked so bad that they canceled it. Oh yeah it got that bad. Also on the trasilation seems like a train wreck. If you don't watch it by subtitles you might miss the Final fantasy feel of the story which is extremely sad i found that out near the end. In my opinion this was wrost than spirits with in. I tried to like it but i couldn't manage with such crumy character models that seemed that they where done by amatures at gonzo. I think the reason for the making of this anime was either for: To scare people about crossovers and how bad they can get. Or Square-enix and Gonzo where making so much money Square enix said ""hey lets make something that lowers our sales!"" and Gonzo was probably like ""Hey yeah let's make it a series that kid's can't grasp the concept and it's too dumb for adult's to like. lets just put mushroom people!"" If your a kid and like this you probably would get distracted by a passing bird in the sky and forgot what you were doing one second later. It get's that bad. I though i never said this but, I finally found an anime that i don't like at all. Next time when i try to do something like this I'll just flush money down the toilet. Honestly i wouldn't watch it agian unless they would pay me or I was lossing all hope for human kind. Bottom line:

Storyline: -1/5

Animation: 2/5

Music:  3/5 (I wouldn't recomend the sountrack though it's too expesive.)

Overall: 1/5 that's cause too many people praised it making it sound like its a great anime when its not. I would rather sit down and watch pokemon(I don't like pokemon...) Then to see it agian.",1138579200,12,3088,4.382198952879581
1917014,4,B0000C9JEK,"I'd have to say I was disappointed when I first saw the first episodes of Unlimited. It was named Final Fantasy, but very little linked it to the incredible video game series of the same name. The story seemed immature and generic and not interwoven with many character driven side stories; only the Final Fantasy mascots appeared (Chocobo, for one); and the music didn't reflect the classical style that went with the games. So, needless to say, I didn't bother buying anymore of the DVDs in the series.

Then the box set came out, and I admitted to myself that I was at least curious about how this series would end, plus I had learned that Gonzo made Unlimited, and Gonzo has yet to fail me in any of my anime endeavors. I bought it, and I watched the first episodes again. I cringed, because suddenly I felt the same way and even found a few more things I disliked about it. But I didn't stop, and continued to watch, and found that, slowly, this series evolved. It became emotionally driven, with a lot of elements that made Final Fantasy great. There were mascots galore (the stated chocobo, cactuar, moogles, summons, and Cid). Some of the music heard can be heard in previous games (the opening song--not the title song--and the battle victory).

Still, it wasn't as Final Fantasy as its namesake, but I found that in watching the anime the entire way through that that was okay. Though it isn't a good chapter in Final Fantasy, it's a great stand-alone anime nonetheless. It has great animation, a strange style that seems both classical and cutting edge (Astroboy with CG). The story deepens as the two main characters search for their parents, and other story lines reveal themselves as well, such as Kaze's story, the main character in charge of a powerful gun capable of summoning creatures into battle, and Lisa, a martial artist with the power to control elements. The antagonists also turn into something more than they had been in the beginning. A deeper, more sinister foe appears later, one that adds a sense of dread to the story that wasn't there previously. All in all, it adds up to one decent anime. And the value itself can't be beaten. Twenty-five episodes of anime for less than fifty-bucks.

It's difficult, however, to recommend this anime. I'd only recommend this to Final Fantasy fans who don't take the game too serious. If you do, you'll be disappointed with this anime. I'd also recommend it for anyone who enjoys experimentation in their animation. If you enjoyed Kid's Story in the Animatrix, you'll enjoy this.",1133913600,48,2547,4.731981981981982

However if you are not a FF fan, i think you will still enjoy this anime.  The story is done very well, and although the animation isn't cutting edge, the cg included makes up for it. I could get into the story and spoil everything, but what's the fun in that?  All in all a great dvd collection.",1127433600,15,453,4.2823529411764705
1917016,5,B0000C9JEK,"I enjoy this anime not because it has the ""Final Fantasy name""

cause I enjoy the plot and characters.

The anime gets such low ratings cause they think of it as ""Final Fantasy"" and base it off the games.  FFU is an orginal Final Fantasy title, like every final fantasy game has it's own storyline.  What people actually want is a final fantasy anime that is based on one of the games.  People have no concideration for an original FF storyline anime. That's why it gets such a low rating.  I am not a newbie to anime, I personally  look for the message of FFU, which is family and friends conqure evil and keep hopes high.  I think to be a true fan of this anime is to get its message.  I would suggest this to non-final fantasy fans, because they wouldn't judge the anime on how Final Fantsish it is.",1099958400,11,802,4.258278145695364
1917017,4,B0000C9JEK,"The animation is odd... the hand-drawn is good, the computer animation is mostly good, but together it's not so good.  So be prepared.
It's also not entirely for kids... the Magun is so blatantly phallic it's funny.
But you have all the things that make Final Fantasy: chocobos, summoning, a huge plot, and Cid.  The four episodes on disc 1 make you wanting more, just to learn what you don't know yet.",1088553600,,402,4.569444444444445

To me, 2 of the main characters' voice acting seemed lame, the others were at least good. I got about halfway through, and just couldn't bear to watch any more of it.
