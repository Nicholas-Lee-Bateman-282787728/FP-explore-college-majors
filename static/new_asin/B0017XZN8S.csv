Great footage of her operating off the coast of Vietnam. Interesting interviews with crewmen.
Quality is good. Some of the video is narrated, some has captions. Lots of flight line activity.",1268611200,,611,10.127272727272727
8603191,1,B0017XZN8S,"Having been on the USS KItty Hawk for a little over two years in the early 1960s, I was very upset by the quality and content of this video. I have 8mm film from 1962 which shows more of life on this ship than this cheaply made video. I would suggest that you do not waste any $$ on it and not even pay the postage if it is offered at no charge. What a ripoff.",1265587200,,360,3.75
