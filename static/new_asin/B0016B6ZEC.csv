3155793,3,B0016B6ZEC,"Lino's brute menace is tempered with a paternalistic edge and an almost goofy Belmondo provides a neat counterbalance in this low-key but tough noir that looks great on this DVD.  The whole picture is impressive ,but not altogether involving. There's more here to admire than really enjoy.",1220054400,,289,5.148936170212766

wonderful--thanks to the very talented director, Monsieur Sautet. Highly
recommended!",1219881600,5,355,5.592592592592593

8262056,5,B0016B6ZEC,superb !  involving from the very beginning till the last.  a classic. few films are created this well these days and there weren't enough in those days either.  a must see for movie lovers.,1523836800,,190,4.529411764705882
8262057,5,B0016B6ZEC,"Excellent film. Belmondo made it the same year as Breathless which got all the press but he is great in this one as is Lino Ventura, a giant of Cinema acting. Written by the controversial criminal Jose Giovanni, it has an air of authenticity. An overlooked gem of French Crime Cinema.",1491350400,,284,4.588235294117647
8262058,5,B0016B6ZEC,"This is every bit as good as any of the John-Pierre Melville gangster films. Might as well buy it, as you'll never find it on Netflix or cable.",1483574400,,143,4.142857142857143
8262059,5,B0016B6ZEC,"Excellent vendor.  Another tour-de-force performance by Ventura, who transcends the story like Humphrey Bogart.",1480982400,,111,6.928571428571429
8262060,5,B0016B6ZEC,"If you enjoy gangster movies but haven't discovered the French crime oeuvre, this picture (translated as Consider All Risks) is a perfect introduction. If you're already a fan, you need to add this masterpiece to your collection. It's the simple tale of a French criminal (Lino Ventura) trying to get home to Paris from his exile in Italy, with his family in tow. Helping him is an honorable young crook played by Jean-Paul Belmondo in his first role after his star-making performance in the Godard classic  bout de souffle (Breathless). This being a French movie, don't expect things to turn out well.",1428624000,2,602,4.901960784313726
8262061,4,B0016B6ZEC,"The great actors Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo working together in this film, that alone makes this movie worth watching. It's a crime film, primarily dark in nature, about a gangster who tries his best to provide for his children as his life as a gangster is crumbling around him. He doesn't know who to trust, or where to turn. Belmondo plays a young thief who agrees to help him.

The set up is fantastic, but the closing act of the film struggles to find a clean resolution. Nonetheless, this gem of a crime film is worth watching for fans of these actors.",1393718400,,566,4.495145631067961
8262062,5,B0016B6ZEC,a no-nonsense meditation on living the life while trying to be a father at the same time.  a valentine to good-hearted bastards.,1356652800,2,128,4.818181818181818
8262063,4,B0016B6ZEC,"Claude Sautet is not one of the most prolific French film directors but he stands among the best.  This is his debut film but seemed
to be made by a mature hand.  A very good and well-mounted black and white crime story with the rock-like Lino Ventura supported by the charming and under-playing Jean-Paul Belmondo about criminals who do not hesitate to pull the triggers yet a human at heart among families and friends.  It is about friendship, loyalty, betrayal, tragedy and crime rarely rewards with an abrupt and befitting ending.  A fine film still stands solid after over 50 years.",1347408000,2,587,4.782178217821782
8262064,3,B0016B6ZEC,"A well filmed sequence of interesting events, but lacking a hook, or characters in whom I felt invested, or sufficient narrative drive for me to really call it a story.",1323993600,,168,4.633333333333334
8262065,5,B0016B6ZEC,"Claude Sautet was a promient French director. And as a proof of this fact, this film says it all.

A criminal on the run (Abel Davos) finds going home after a decade is harder than he expects. Davos (Lino Ventura) is wanted for murder in France, and has been living underground in Italy for ten years. Since then, Abel has married Therese (Simone France) and fathered two sons, and once he's decided it's time to come home. Abel has planed a well zealous scheme in which he'll steal a fortune to finance his journey and head home with Therese and the boys, but the fate paves its way and ruins what it was planned, so when he arrives in Paris without his wife and running from the law with two kids in tow. An underworld boss who owes Abel some favors helps him put together a plan to travel across France in an ambulance to avoid suspicion, and recruits a headstrong young gangster, Eric (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to serve as Abel's driver and right-hand-man. En route, Abel tries to settle some old score with criminal associates who betrayed him.

As you may expect, the presence on stage of two remarkable first-rate actors like Lino Ventura and the rising star by then - Jean Paul Belmondo - ignite the screen in this tragic Noir in which nothing is going right and where all the odds are against him. Every step he makes seems to be hovered by a tragic spell and so he decides to take a personal revenge to end with his supposed friends. Stark helps him but it's obvious he feels for Davos a strange fascination and visible admiration by his cold-blooded behavior. Nevertheless the fatal game began and nothing will stop it.

Based on a novel by Jose Giovanni, Classe Tous Risques was the first feature film from Sautet, who previously worked as an assistant director for some of France's most prestigious filmmakers.",1301011200,5,1819,4.6080246913580245
