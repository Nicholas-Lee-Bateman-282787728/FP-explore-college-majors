6197686,2,B00HQOD0SM,"I love Andy Garcia but was a little disappointed in this movie.  Although there were some touching moments, overall it was slow.  The daughter was obnoxious also and not a super likeable character.  The woman, although I know they were trying to make her seem like a free spirit was just over the top sometimes and Andy, who is usually a wonderful actor, seemed uncomfortable in his part.  I guess I was hoping it would be about two single (either widowed or divorced) middle aged people who meet when accompanying their kids on a college tour and fall in love.  Instead it was two people, unhappy in their marriages (blah, blah blah) that make a connection for a day and toy with the idea to continue seeing each other.  No matter that they didn't have a full on affair, there is just that underlying sense of wrongness throughout the movie.",1393113600,28,842,4.58

6197691,5,B00HQOD0SM,Loved this little movie with much humor. Vera Farmiga is hilarious. Garcia's humor is a relief to see again.

6197696,5,B00HQOD0SM,"I usually don't write movie reviews, but am motivated in this case because I don't think that the other reviews that I have read have captured the essence of this movie.

First, the film is amusing, charming, and interesting.  Ok, that given, it is about two people who are apparently reasonably well situated in life, both financially and in their interpersonal relationships.  They are intelligent and personable.  But to their surprise they discover in just one take-the-kids-to-checkout-colleges-day that there may be better for both of them: each other.  The perception is built carefully, and in my view, convincingly as the movie progresses.

In the end, they decide that they can't yield to their temptation with all the consequent hurt, disruption, trauma and risk that would ensue if they were to abandon current spouses.  I think in varying degrees it is a common situation for many of us.  In the movies (e.g., ""Falling In Love""), the moral dilemma is usually resolved with time, death or divorce.  In this case, they walk away, sadly and reluctantly.

It is very poignant.  The film certainly is not a romantic comedy (as it is called by several reviewers), at least in the classical meaning of the the term ""comedy"".  It is a romantic tragedy",1490400000,2,1256,4.956937799043062

As they interact, a connection develops, each scene building on the last, and most scenes including humor - not guffaws, but gentle laugh-with-them fun.  I would be a spoiler to discuss the ending, so I won't.  I will say that it has some minimalist characteristics of an indie, in that it is filmed mostly on one location with few speaking parts, but it is well produced and the cinematography is excellent.

6197723,3,B00HQOD0SM,"At Middleton stars Patricia Heaton and Eugene Levy... er, I mean Vera Farmiga and Andy Garcia who bring their teens (Spencer Lofranco who is Andy's son and Vera's daughter Taissa Farmiga, which is hilarious as the choice for daughter because in reality they're both sisters) to college but due to a lack of interest they become too bored and distracted to pay attention to the tour, so they find themselves leaving their kids behind and venturing around campus on their own.

Unfortunately the storytelling is a victim of wandering a lot with writing that's only so-so most of the time. Granted At Middleton is supposed to be a semi-love story with an adventurous twist, but it fails to keep a consistently good story flowing for most of it and honestly gets boring about 30 minutes before it's over which is when I finally determined that the movie isn't going to get better.

Anyway Andy and Vera do all sorts of things together.  They ride bikes around campus even though Andy's bike-riding skills are shaky at best, quickly run up stairs to the top of bell towers where Andy reveals his fear of heights, visit piano classes and play chopsticks together while having no concern for the student practicing in the next room over, avoid security who's hot on their trail on one occasion (a missed opportunity for the two of them to continue avoiding the cops throughout the film, I think), participate in plays and reenact what it's like for a marriage couple sitting at the dinner table contemplating divorce, get into disagreements with other parents around campus (more lost potential since Andy and Vera should have been more aggressive to spice up the writing) and smoking drugs/acting silly with the kids later on.  By this point (with the drug intake) the movie felt like it was way too long and I found myself leaving the room a couple times.

Another problem is that Taissa comes across as totally unlikeable, selfish and ignorant whereas Spencer is just too obedient, polite and boring, so neither stories involving these two are anything special.  It's all about Vera and Andy getting to know each other better while having mini adventures around the college campus.  Other characters like the college radio DJ (Peter Riegert), the college professor/advisor (Tom Skerritt) and the college student who encourages Andy and Taissa to let loose with drug usage (Daniella Garcia Lorido) felt underused and never amounted to anything special, and Andy being a cardiac surgeon never amounted to anything noteworthy either.

Just lots of lost potential, however the ending is quite sad.  I wasn't expecting such a serious ending after the goofiness and playfulness that makes up the rest of the film.  If only the story was beefier and the writing sharper, this could have been a terrific movie.  Perhaps Andy and Vera could have been used in more interesting ways in relation to avoiding their kids since a subtle part of the writing is that the parents go one way while the teens go another.  As it stands, it's a light-hearted somewhat boring comedy/romance about two adults hitting off a friendship and feeling young again.",1446768000,,3130,4.90719696969697

No one can control their emotional outbursts, and in a film that's all about communication, only the radio dj seems to have his act together.

6197741,4,B00HQOD0SM,"At Middleton is one of those movies that seems like it will either inspire a deep seated understanding and, dare I say, love of the content or just rise the ire of those who cannot stand for anyone to consider liking anything with even a hint of the amoral.  But, realistically, there is a lot of realism in the story of two parents taking a college tour with their children and, over the course of the day, discovering mutual attraction amongst the turmoil of having to return to their separate lives with their significant others but without the child being around in the future.  Andy Garcia is a joy in anything and Vera Farmiga has shown she has the ability to hang with the best.  There's something well suited yet awkward about these two the moment the characters meet on screen that works.

Now, the film isn't perfect and there are plenty of moments that just about jump the shark, particularly in the final third.  These moments either seem to be more for comedic or dramatic effect and only sort of help the characters reach the inevitable conclusion.  The ending for this romdramcom is more of the dramatic but realistic sort.  As much as I wanted to hate the ending, I appreciated the twists and turns the film took while balancing the story of the parents with that of the children and then having the guts to not make it an easy ending.  For that alone I'm willing to overlook the weird and almost inappropriate diversions on occasion.  At Middleton might not be the cream of the crop, but what it does well is reflect how our decisions define the course of our lives and how our expectations can often be thwarted if we hold them too close.",1428624000,4,1656,4.530201342281879

6197745,2,B00HQOD0SM,"Apparently this movie resonates with some people. Maybe the only way to find out is to watch it. But for me, it was a disappointment. The dvd jacket makes it look like two people having a fun time but there was a lot of ugliness (in behavior and character) and many, many unrealistic scenarios, including the main premise, that these two very different lead characters fall in deep love in the course of a few hours.

For those that care, yes the two leads are married to other people. No, they don't ""do"" much of anything aside from what would be called emotional cheating.

Here are the sort of things that drove me crazy (not in a good way):

The Mom behaves very rudely to another tour group, interrupting their tour and dredging up her own family dysfunction in a rant. One person in the tour group responds with some minor sarcastic remark like ""Thanks for sharing!"" Then the dad, the uptight conventional heart surgeon, makes him (the recipient of the abuse) apologize instead of the other way around!

The dad has a fear of heights which the mom miraculously cures in a few minutes atop the bell tower.

The two parents steal bicycles for an extended joy ride around campus and this is supposed to be funny?

Both parents completely ditch their children on an important college tour that was supposed to be a bonding experience. They don't even meet their kids for lunch and they lie to their kids in order to prolong their escapades with each other. Besides being an awful life choice, it's unbelievable, particularly on the part of the dad.

I didn't exactly find it boring and I did watch it through (maybe because I was sick and didn't have anything better to do) but it was not an enjoyable experience.",1425340800,,1715,4.584967320261438

Kudos to the writers, director, producers, the actors, everyone involved. Have watched it three times and am sure will watch it again in the future. I had first thought that Taissa Vermiga was Vera's daughter, in fact there is 21 years between them, but as pointed out, she amazing is Vera's sister. There is definitely a family resemblance. I'll bet it was a very fun and rewarding experience for the to work together on this movie. Also, didn't know that the actress who plays the student running the movie camera at the college theatre is Andy's daughter. She was also great in her role, exhibiing a lot of warmth. For those of us middle aged or more, I couldn't recommend this movie enough. Vera stars in another adult oriented movie, Up in the Air, with George Clooney. Highly recommended as well.",1413504000,2,947,4.815950920245399

6197775,4,B00HQOD0SM,"Flipping channels I saw enough of this well crafted character piece that I had to buy it...why? becasue I liked the characters and wanted to spend time with them.

This is an engaging, poignant, light/heavy hearted ""romp"" of a couple who met and split away from a first year tour of the Middleton College campus with their kids, who meet as well...and skillfully set up the avoir fini.

After watching the film a few times with friends, I've become an emotional tag-a-long to their love story.  Consummate acting skills made every breath, look and kiss count with solid suspense to the last scene.

Sadly two ""comic relief"" scenes with students encountered by our couple were very disppointing but I'm sure that I'll be revisiting Edith and George again just to spend some time with ""our"" now shared journey.",1410998400,3,808,4.833333333333333
6197776,5,B00HQOD0SM,"""At Middleton"" is a cute and refreshing comedy starring Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga. The two stars play George and Edith who meet on the campus of Middleton University. Taissa Farmiga plays Audrey, daughter of Edith but in real life, Taissa and Vera are sisters, no wonder they look so much alike. I'm a huge of fan of Vera Farmiga so that was reason alone to watch this movie. And of course Vera steals every scene she's in. Her character Edith is a free-spirit and extremely stubborn. Her daughter, Audrey is a control-freak and an unlikable over-achiever. Andy Garcia is not normally my favorite actor, but he's pretty good in this film. Vera and Andy have great chemistry and their dislike for each other in the beginning of the film is pretty hilarious. Along the way, George and Edith begin to bond while their children wander the campus. Edith tries to loosen up George because he's so stuffy and untrusting. Ultimately they bring out the best in each other and sparks start to fly. The ending was a little bit sad but overall, I enjoyed ""At Middleton"" tremendously and would definitely see it again.",1409875200,3,1108,4.716494845360825

6197779,5,B00HQOD0SM,"At Middleton, is a delightful romantic comedy about two middle aged adults, with very different personalities that can't deny the reality of what they find in a day. George Hartman, (Andy), is a stuffy cardiac surgeon and Edith Martin, (Vera), is a free spirited children's furniture store owner. They instantly take a dislike to each other in the parking lot where they are taking their children on a college tour of Middleton. They decide to take a tour of the college on their own. Both are married and that isn't known until the movie progresses. They both admit that their individual marriages aren't working and they are experiencing the empty nest syndrome. Although it wasn't planned, they find the love of a lifetime. George becomes captivated in a single day by feelings that he hasn't felt for years and Edith discovers that she is attracted to George, although she first tries to deny it.

There are many fun and dramatic moments in this movie. The ""borrowing"" of bicycles to take a ride and being followed by college security, the very dramatic drama class and lunch together, the piano playing, and the scenes in the Bell Tower are very engaging by Andy and Vera. This film contains a very powerful message. There is the realization that some things in life only last for a moment but that a brief encounter can bring heart felt memories that last forever. It is something that can't easily be dismissed. The last line is a sad one, "" Let's take the long way home, "" George tells his son as they drive away. Although the ending was sad, I am one fan that is hoping that it is for more than a day.  I have read where Andy Garcia is aware that viewers of this movie would like a sequel and see George and Edith together. I hope this becomes a reality.

I have followed Andy Garcia's career for many years and Vera Farmiga is an actress that is  being recognized as one of the great actresses of our time.  As some say, Vera is a young Meryl Streep and I believe that. These two make a beautiful couple and it is refreshing to see them both in the comedy scenes together even though they are both known for their very dramatic films which both have earned them awards. I think the comedy is hilarious and this movie is worth seeing.

Taissa Farmiga as Audrey Martin and Spencer Lofranco as Conrad Hartman did credible performances as the teenagers attempting to choose a college, and trying to find their own way, leaving the nest egg on their own terms. I have watched this movie more than once and I am sure it will always be one of my very favorites.",1409443200,8,2564,4.515086206896552

6197781,4,B00HQOD0SM,"This film succeeds because of the fine, committed performances of its two leads.  Andy Garcia jumps into this role with both feet.  His performance is textured, layered and brave.  Vera Farmiga's performance is as airy and rich as a French pastry.  The script has problems and at times stretches the boundaries of believability; but watch it!

Using a thin plot of pre-college visits with their son and daughter respectively and only a couple plot devices to keep things moving, Andy Garcia plays against type as a buttoned-down heart surgeon and Vera Fermiga, a successful and free-spirited businesswoman, reveal over the course of the movie deeply human characters that the viewer actually cares about. Although we never get specifics of their existential angst, it is palpable. We get the sense that although successful, they are estranged from their lives, and their desire to connect with something authentic, without emotional baggage, draws them inexorably in to a day of glimpses of what might have been / what is / and even perhaps what could, but can never be.  It is that final bittersweet recognition that is summed up in the films closing line as Andy Garcia and his son begin their drive home. Asked which route to take, Andy's character, having seized the day, and in no hurry to release it, replies, ""Take the long way.""",1408924800,8,1037,4.886363636363637

This was the movie that put her on the map, and bravo!  In, coincidentally, another movie about addiction, Andy Garcia played the wife of alcoholic Meg Ryan (When a Man Loves a Woman).  Both stellar movies.  And here they are again, together.  What potential.  And they gave it their best. I felt embarrassed for them, watching them  rn through fountains, stoned, and imitating Charlie Chaplin.  This whole movie is a trite piece of formulaic writing -- you know, you've seen these antics before -- parents let down their hair and get high while uptight kids try to navigate their futures.  A word used incorrectly makes the round from one to the other and finally back again.  Parents hijack a couple of bicycles and go tooling around the campus, oh what fun.  Trust me -- you've seen all these silly devices before, or close enough, many times.  The good bits -- there is some honest dialogue about facing into empty nest mid life loneliness.  But here too, better portrayed in Enough Said.

Poor Andy and Vera.  I hope they made enough off this to allow them to sit back and seriously consider their choices for their next dramatic roles.",1404172800,4,1368,4.530612244897959

Andy Garcia is at his handsomest as a conservative professional, while Vera Farmiga is a witty adventurist, full of life, certainly not a dull suburban housewife. They meet, they flirt, have fun exploring the college and getting to know each other, and they fall in love.

I believe this film was intended  for audiences around my age who are experiencing the ""empty nest syndrome.""The ""adults' in the film acted selfishly, and as so often happens in our ""me first"" culture, did whatever made them feel good. With only the slightest twinge of conscience, they ignored the vows they had taken and the life-long responsibility they took on when they decided to bring children into the world. Yes, intimate conversations, passionate kissing and fantasizing about someone other than your spouse is cheating! Just because they were so noble as to stop before having sex, they had not acted honorably.

You are supposed to feel sorry for the two who have  spent years lamenting their own sad and lonely marriages rather than making an effort to make their own marriages fulfilling.

6197830,5,B00HQOD0SM,"After reading some of the poor reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect-- but I had a hunch that the people giving the poor reviews were coming from a place of moralizing the characters rather than opening to the authentic emotion they portrayed.  The teenaged characters were true to my experience of the current generation of teens, as were their interactions with their parents-- this is one of the things I loved about the film.  It contrasted the ""know-it-all"" attitude of teens trying to break away from their parents, with their incredible vulnerability and need for parental direction.  Both teens' character's were well developed, well acted, and so likable in the end.

As for the chemistry that develops between the two married parents-- so touching and realistic-- I thought the writer did a great job at allowing these characters to trust their marriages enough to engage in the innocent banter and play, which was so fun for the viewer, and which eventually begins to spark longing for what's missing in both their marriages (and perhaps the viewers too!).  This so epitomizes the state of many marriages, particularly at the moment of empty-nesting.  This film awakened in me a desire to reconnect with the kid in myself, and to open to being playful again with my partner.  (spoiler alert for the rest of what I will say: I think it was perfect that these two characters opened each other to what they'd lost of themselves in their marriages, and yet ultimately chose to remain faithful (much as I personally and perhaps vicariously wanted them to just go for it!)  I think it's just human to wrestle with the desire to pursue genuine connection/chemistry when it confronts you this way-- and it's good.  These people weren't out looking for it.  It arose in the most innocent of ways, catching them both completely off guard.

This film (for me) achieved a rare thing in that it inspired, gave insight, caused me to question, and provided two hours of such light-hearted and sexy fun.  I love Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga.  Perfectly cast!!!  If you want to laugh and feel some heart-ache, and aren't afraid of what's real, see this movie!

6197849,5,B00HQOD0SM,"Heart surgeon and straight-laced type, George Hartman (Andy Garcia), is taking his unimpressed son, Conrad (Spencer Lofranco), to take the ""two hour tour"" of the academic and visually pleasing Middleton University in the beautiful state of Washington.  He soon is joined in the parking lot by Edith Martin (Vera Farmiga), who is also bringing her opinionated daughter, Audrey (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's actual sister).  Edith is a free spirited, beautiful woman and is more cautious about the University's safety than her daughter appears to be.  She is also pretty witty from the outset.

The two teens are not all that enthused about having to go on this tour with the guide, Justin (Nicolas Braun), better known as 'The Dingleberry', although this is how they are able to view what may be the school they will be attending. They appear so informed already and a bit bored with it all.  As the group of intended students and their family members begin, Conrad and Audrey's parents purposely get separated from everyone for an adventure of their own.  Edith hops on a student's parked bike and taunts George until he does the same.  Like a couple of teens themselves, they take off for the day together.

Directed by Adam Rodgers, this is a feeling story which is much more about the two adult's lives and much less about their children's.  George and Edith are like vinegar and oil when they first start out, then their tangible chemistry just oozes to the surface.  Farmiga shines while pitching sarcastic  one-liners at Garcia who is the perfect straight man for her quipping.  The dialogue takes on a tone that is witty, wisecracking, and extremely likable for the two leads.  Throughout the day, these two experience several different people, places and situations together.  One with distinct significance is the Bell Tower, which gets revisited at a later time.  The two also slip into an acting class, among several other situations, while it is in session commenting aloud towards the director that the scene about marriage didn't seem plausible to them.  She has the two of them improvise the scene at a moments notice which offers a different viewpoint for the group of students while getting dangerously close to the quality of their own marriages.  It is after this point that the dialogue and the feelings between George and Edith take on new meaning and open up parts of themselves that they have kept hidden for many years.

There are a couple of smaller roles with Tom Skerritt as Dr. Roland Emerson, the Linguistics Professor, that Audrey is itching to study with. Also an unexpected music themed role with Peter Riegert as 'Boneyard Slims' along with Conrad, making this even more interesting.  I really enjoyed this movie for the little story with the huge heart that it was for me and also for the easily developed chemistry between Garcia and Farmiga.  The intricate soundtrack (Arturo Sandoval), along with the duo playing 'Chopsticks', was easily as lovely as the scenery (Emmanuel Kadosh) ""At Middleton"".",1398124800,15,3027,4.968253968253968

6197851,2,B00HQOD0SM,"""At Middleton"" is a mid-life romance that suffers from a terminal case of the cutes. Edith (Vera Farmiga) and George (Andy Garcia) meet while taking their respective children, Audrey (Taissa Farmiga) and Conrad (Spencer Lofranco), on a tour of a fictional college (their respective spouses are conveniently unable to attend the event). While the kids are going through the official orientation, the two parents break off and conduct a tour of their own, exploring the campus as well as each other.

Despite the best of intentions, ""At Middleton"" feels phony from the get-go. We get the sense that Edith and George are unreasonably antagonistic towards one another at the beginning just so they can become an item by the end. And things don't get any better from there, as the parents proceed to make fun of the tour guide, steal bikes from some unsuspecting students on campus, horn in on an acting class, smooch in a projection booth, get stoned in a dorm room, and in general act superior to everyone they meet, with corn, affectation and heavy-handed life lessons the order of the day.

Though the movie tries very hard to achieve moments of ""little people"" sentimental uplift, virtually every scene in ""At Middleton"" emerges as hopelessly contrived and calculated, a reflection more on the screenwriters Glenn German and Adam Rogers (who also directed the movie) than on the actors, who do their best under the circumstances. Farigna, so impressive in TV's ""Bates Motel,"" comes across as unnecessarily grating at times, the result of a grown woman behaving in a less mature fashion than her teenaged daughter perhaps, her joie de vivre and truth-telling assertiveness, which might have seemed refreshing in small doses, ultimately falling over the edge into obnoxiousness (though she does well playing opposite her real life daughter). As the buttoned-down heart surgeon who really needs to loosen up and learn how to enjoy life, Garcia is constrained by having to embody a character with no truly interesting or compelling personal traits (the fact that he's supposed to be that way doesn`t exactly make him any more interesting).

I know we're supposed to be moved and inspired by what`s happening between Edith and George, but all I could think about while watching their story unfold is how some parents just can't help making what is supposed to be a special day for their kids really all about themselves.",1397606400,,2415,5.017456359102244

6197879,4,B00HQOD0SM,"SPOILER AHEAD

Two people, both in complacent marriages, meet by chance one morning, fall in love, and then, at the end of the day, go back to their own, separate lives.

I know that sounds like the plot of Noel Coward's BRIEF ENCOUNTER, but it also applies to AT MIDDLETON, a pleasant romantic comedy, recently released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga play parents of college-ready kids, who are spending an ""open house"" day at Middleton University.  Staid Garcia is a heart surgeon, traveling with his son (Spencer Lofranco), who doesn't really want to be there, while the more adventurous Vera, who runs a children's furniture store, is with her daughter (played by her sister, Taissa Farmiga), and that young lady is gung ho to study under linguistics professor Tom Skerritt.

Neither parent seems to be getting on that well with their individual offspring, so they break away from the tour and stroll the campus on their own.  Despite their differences in personality, the couple is definitely attracted to each other and, by the end of the day; each has discovered a passion within that had long been dormant.

Adam Rodgers directed and co-wrote  (with Glenn German) AT MIDDLETON, a film with likable characters, well played by a fine cast, and spry dialogue.  Indeed, this is an amiable movie, though I do feel that it overstays its welcome by about fifteen minutes, and there is also one key scene in an acting class that feels forced.  Certainly these talented writers could have come up with a more believable way to get over that story juncture.

Peter Riegert plays a key supporting role in the picture.

DVD extras include audio commentary by Rodgers, German and Garcia, outtakes and a music video by Andy Garcia.

It is somewhat refreshing that ""At Middleton"", a middling romantic comedy set during a tour of a scenic college campus, focuses on a couple of adults at a crossroads in their lives rather than a pair of entitled adolescents pondering which prospective institute of higher education to attend.
As for Garcia's George, a heart surgeon, and Farmiga's Edith, a retailer of children's furniture, both parents are accompanying their only offspring on a road-trip quest to decide their academic futures. And that is where the similarities end. Bow-tie enthusiast George is an uptight square who shuns taking risks. Unconventional Edith is a mouthy free spirit for whom rules are meant to be broken.",1393200000,2,998,5.124223602484472

8634385,5,B00HQOD0SM,I really enjoyed this film. Both Garcia and Farmiga are charming and their chemistry is very believable. The scene where they step in to show some college drama students how married people really talk to each other is fantastic. I was really rooting for them.,1494806400,,259,4.777777777777778
