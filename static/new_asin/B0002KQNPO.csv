2100617,4,B0002KQNPO,"Referencing the American remake of Breathless and Deliverance (and not in the obvious way) without commenting on them, Twentynine Palms offers up shocking finale for which even the promise of a shocking finale will not prepare you.  Often, sudden and violent endings feel desperately tacked on so that audiences have something to talk about and distributors have something by which to sell the film.  In this case, however, the finale really causes you to reexamine the material.  Bruno calls this an experimental horror film; his interview and statement of purpose are a bit overly-grave and under deep-he repeats himself on but a few points and says very little beyond the idea that he thinks people are really animals.  Though that is basic stuff I give the benefit of the doubt to him and assume that we are getting a poor translation.  In short, I think the point of the film is better realized in this film itself than it is in Bruno's translated discussion of it.

The demonstration of every human's vulnerability in this film is so graphically and unexpectedly rendered as to make it, in fact, one of the more terrifying films I've seen as an adult.  It doesn't mean to remind us of the monster in the closet or the monster in our own hearts so much as it means to remind us that we are flesh and blood exposed to all the monstrosities of the world, regardless the strength of our minds, the intelligence of our emotions.  In the end, brutal death is waiting and ""deserve has nothing to do with it"".

It brings to mind the Charles Bukowski quote: ""There are no beautiful women; there are not strong men"".  For in this film, everything is broken down.",1096502400,25,1658,4.666666666666667
2100618,1,B0002KQNPO,"I was truly shocked by the utter lack of content, characters, plot, etc. in this film.  The back of the DVD case was more entertaining than the actual movie.  Fortunately, I had absolutely no expectations having never seen any of Bruno Dumont's previous work.  If you enter the viewing process of this film with high expectations, I think you may commit suicide by the end (or before), considering the only excitement in the hour and a half of torturous pointlessness occurs in the last 4 seconds - 10 minutes, whatever.  Before the ""surprise"" ending, the entire basis for the film is a couple of days in the life of one American photographer (David) minus the camera and his Russian name having French girlfriend (Katia) with obvious psychological issues.  They are looking at a location for a photo shoot (the desert) and staying in a nasty roadside motel.  Well, that's it!  Just kidding, but it feels like that, believe me.  They spend their days driving through the desert, wondering through the Joshua trees, fighting about nothing & swimming in the motel pool.  They do other things in the motel pool, too.  Okay, that really is all of it.  The ending was interesting in a ""huh, well that just happened"" kind of way.  It is certainly no compensation for the hour and a half of your life that you have just wasted.  Twentynine Palms is a truly pointless (in a bad way) film.",1095984000,9,1380,4.676348547717843
2100619,4,B0002KQNPO,"Described by one critic at the Venice Film Festival as the ""Brown Bunny"" of that year's fest, one finds themselves at a loss of how to accurately describe the film without giving much away, or even giving the film it's justice. Comparisons to ""The Brown Bunny,"" a film I admittedly adored, seem solely justified in that both films are longing, nearly-silent meditations on disturbing subject matter (both by arguably masterful, challenging, and, albeit, pretentious filmmakers). ""Twentynine Palms"" follows an American photographer and his French girlfriend through the California desert in their existential, stark journey for... that I'm not sure. It's almost hard to defend an appreciation for the film, when it seems so easy to dismiss the film as overtly brutal and (as some would think) boring... and even pointless. Yet Bruno Dumont, who previously caused quiet controversy over his equally-startling other films Humanite and La Vie de Jesus, makes ""Twentynine Palms"" fascinating in its study of these two individuals (or perhaps two cultures, depending on how you disect the film). Fans -- granted there probably aren't many -- of Dumont's previous films should find the film especially intoxicating, but those uninterested in challenging, shocking motion pictures should probably steer clear... at their own loss.",1091232000,15,1321,5.4487804878048784

2100623,3,B0002KQNPO,"Lots of reviews of this film have noted its pointlessness and in all fairness, there's a lot of truth to these reviews. One of the most grating things is the director's incredibly high-falutin' ostensibly philosophical explanation/description of what he was trying to do when he made the movie, which he ""reveals"" (for lack of a better term) in an interview. Unfortunately, it's very pretentious sounding.

That being said, there's an interesting parallel here to another ""two souls lost in a huge barren place"" movie, ""Gerry"" by Gus Van Sant. ""Gerry"" is a really interesting film, I think, and there are some intriguing similarities. But the Van Sant film really probes its two same-named characters, while the Domont film, ""Twentynine Palms"" spends a lot of time with its two characters engaged in back and forth stuff.

So why the three stars? Good question. The back and forth stuff consists of alternating bickering and sex and, at least for me, it felt like there was some weird kind of atmosphere building up as a result of this. As in the Van Sant film, there are fairly long stretches of the two characters traveling (in ""Gerry"", by foot; in ""Twentynine Palms"", by car) with little else happening. It's during the traveling that we feel the complete emptiness of the relationship. The reason, though, that I gave ""Gerry"" four stars is that the relationship has some depth, is palpable, emotionally reverberates, while in the Dumont film, that's not the case.

In spite of this pronounced shallowness, though, there's something going on and it ain't good. There IS a slowly creeping malaise that you do begin to feel, minute by minute, and in fact, I think Dumont does a reasonably good job at this.

The problem is that this creeping malaise is shattered with a double blast (not literally a blast, as in shotgun, but referring to an outburst) of violence at the end of the film, making it, I would say, not so much pointless, but more like a huge doofy cartoon. The cartoonishness in particular is emphasized in the totally bizarre getup one of the characters sports in the penultimate scene.

It kind of feels like the reason Dumont chose this really wacked out ending was to emphasize how America is the land of random personal violence. But the problem with that is, that point's already been made in a bunch of films. I think what he should have done is to build on the creepiness he started and instead of hitting us over the head with an outrageously cartoonish ending, move the characters to some kind of bizarre climax that much more naturally develops as a result of the buildup. I guess he just couldn't control himself.

Too bad. This really should have, I would say, two and a half stars, but maybe I was feeling generous. The creepiness is done relatively well. But the ending totally destroys it.",1181692800,4,2820,4.780287474332649
2100624,1,B0002KQNPO,"This couldn't have been released in theaters.  I couldn't imagine it.

If you find that you have to watch this movie, here are 3 points of advice:

1. Get control of the remote to fast forward through the long pointless scenes and the almost never ending static shots.

2. Watch it on a large TV.  Apparently they blew all of their money on leasing the Hummer and didn't have enough left over for a zoom lens.  There are plenty of static long distance shots where it's a mystery as to where one is supposed to be looking.  Hint, watch for movement.

3. Bring something else to do while it's on.

I wasn't actually able to take watching all of this thing, so maybe I missed the ""good"" stuff.  I can say however that ending isn't part of the possibly missed good stuff.

This movie made me feel a little guilty.  After watching this, I think I owe Eragon at least another star.  There was some nice scenery it that one at least.  The amazon scale should go something like 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 stars in order to properly rate the trash.

2100625,4,B0002KQNPO,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not keenly familiar with the work of Bruno Dumont.  I know he's experimental and he could care less about narrative or content guidelines and all that fancy indie cred...I get it, he is a guy who makes movies on his own terms.  The problem with that is if one of your films gets some of the attention that Twentynine Palms has from the uninitiated, or those of us who are accustomed to more conventional movies, and you have a whole bunch of people pissing on your misunderstood work.  I think of a conversation I had with a film student about Peter Greenaway's The Falls.  They saw it and hated it, but unfortunately for them it was the only Greenaway film they had seen, so they sort of missed the point...actually, they didn't even get the context Greenaway was making his point in.  I suspect that is what's happened here.

Twentynine Palms has a narrative and it is somewhat palpable to a mainstream audience...especially one that it is eager to be shocked. Dumont tells the story of Photographer David and his French girlfriend Katia having sex and examining the beautiful landscapes of southwestern United States after leaving Los Angeles. The pacing of the film and the pretty consistent nudity and sexual content allow us to engage the characters on an intimate level and sort of enjoy the peace, or at least silence, they exist in during this road trip (mind you this is not nearly as explicit as people say it is...its just two naked people who don't even look really great naked anyway).  They seem disconnected and somewhat isolated throughout.  It actually reaches a level of character depth I don't think dialogue can often reach...to me it's kind of the advantage movies have over other mediums.  The content during the film up to this point is what makes the film so real and believable and it did this without me really noticing its purpose.  Everything is pretty ordinary with these people, but why is Dumont showing us this?

He is setting the stage for what turns out to be a very disruptive tragedy that befalls these two people.  The way we are set up is what makes the film so filthy and profoundly dark.  You have to really watch these characters the whole time to get the full effect, but I'm not so sure everyone in the audience wants this film to cut that deeply.  There is a clear a message here and every scene assists in giving the conclusion deeper meaning.

Dumont has not created an anti-American film necessarily and he definitely doesn't set out to conquer Hollywood.  He's simply made a film that tries to simulate tragedy and gives us the rare opportunity to empathize.  This film is probably only really worth experiencing for a select few who can appreciate it.  The rest of us should probably pass.",1178064000,13,2779,4.6482617586912065

This is my favorite movie from Bruno Dumont.  Many people compare it with other films or say that it is really bad, but I disagree.  This film is totally original, or as original as one can be these days.  There exists nothing else like it. The desert, the sex, the dialogue, the suspense, the horror.

2100631,2,B0002KQNPO,"When I rented TWENTYNINE PALMS, I knew it would showcase Bruno Dumont's taste for dispassionate portrayals, violence of various sorts, and shock. In spite of this mental preparation, this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me, a seasoned viewer, rattled. Unfortunately, the shock and awe it achieves is short lived. 'PALMS is modeled on the horror film, but, like many of its American cousins, the horror it achieves failed to haunt me. The narrative as a whole left me rattled, yes, but there was also an unsettled feeling, as if a cynic had just talked my ear off.  I wondered, ""Is there really something to this guy's story, or is just him?"" You may also get the sense that the horror of 'PALMS is more about the worldview of the director (or his view of America), rather than the world his storytelling creates.

Sam Peckinpaw's STRAW DOGS is in ways a similar but superior film. I can admire 'DOGS for its many strengths, so long as I avoid viewing it as the MAN-AS-ANIMAL fable that Peckinpaw intended. It isn't that I disagree with his view of humans as domesticated animals. Rather, I see 'DOGS as a rare example of violent drama and technical virtuosity transcending the simplicity of its maker's defense; whether Peckinpaw has a point or not seems beside the point. Of course, the trick with any argument is in having good evidence. In pressing one's point of view, there is often, in or out of the filmic context, an artful description of a scene/scenario, one that reflects the viewer's position. In this way, films have the strange ability to create their own myths, their own arguments. To invest a film with one's views too forcibly can dull the work's independent life with the sententiousness of fables.

Watching TWENTYNINE PALMS, it seems impossible to avoid questioning Dumont's personal views. This is partly due to the fact that so many of the events described in the film are implausible. Lacking believable characters and action, one naturally develops a sense that the director is revealing something to us that we haven't seen; something unique to his vision. If the strange behavior of the two principles was about their uniqueness and their relationship (e.g. as outsiders) then why would Dumont undercut their characterization, denying us a belief in them as individuals, or, more profoundly, as points of identification? I gradually came to view the two principles as an every-couple, with private rhythms and misunderstandings that might appear absurd if made public. And indeed, such details of their relationship are hinted at without the benefit of a backstory for us to know them more precisely. So the couple is particular and thus strange, but lacking particulars/details their value becomes more symbolic. They seem to be a snapshot of human coupling in its most bestial simplicity, dimly framed even in bright sunlight. This seemed like a worthy focus, but Dumont forces it to play against a theme of violence, both seen and unseen. The violent atmosphere of the film was something I couldn't account for until the resolution, and even then with difficulty.

Toward the end of film, we're given a horrific equation of two orgasms: that of the male protagonist and that of his rapist, the film's principle antagonist (aside from the desert). Both orgasms are shown to be dangerous, powerful, and unspeakable (or, at least, not clearly worded). This equation discounts the context in which the orgasms occur, leaving the viewer with no reliable distinction of the protagonists from their insanely hostile environment. Clearly, the bourgeois, carefree lifestyle of the couple is set up to be cut down (a horror convention), but Dumont makes the attack personal in the most perverse way. From early in the film on, the protagonists suggest an inner horror, which is unmitigated by their lovemaking, and perhaps even feeds on their relationship. The irrationality of their environment makes the couple our most recognizable guides on this strange road trip, but they demonstrate their own measure of insanity. The male half of the couple betrays an undercurrent of sadism that eventually explodes as an act of sexualized murder. The female's deviance is less clearly defined, but there are several scenes in which she is shown inviting harm. If our trip, as it seems, is through a kind of anti-Eden, and our guides are an every-couple, with no structured identity of their own, then their deviancy would suggest a kind of universal infection, or nature, rather than an aberration of character. This would also render the criminality of the final scenes uncertain, in light of their amoral setting.

Some would say that the best criterion for judging a horror film is whether it horrifies, regardless of how. This is an unsettling film. It is also an especially tasteless one. In watching this DVD, it may be useful to some viewers that Dumont can be found rationalizing his use of violence (and his violence as an artist) in an interview, in a director's statement, and in the course of the film itself.",1116374400,32,5066,4.983451536643026

2100633,3,B0002KQNPO,"**Major Spoilers**

Twenty Nine Palms was a hard one to watch. First it bored us to death with long, untrimmed scenes, seemingly about not too much.

But I didn't think a film that had indulged itself as much as this one would fail to provide a decent payoff at the end.

Well, the film paid off all right.

A lot of what seems to be aimless ballast in the film turns out to have informed the shocking ending.

This guy who looks and acts like Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver, has a lust for sex even Travis, despite his pent up violence, does not display.

Not that the girl wasn't mostly game, though she complained about the underwater sex act in the motel swimming pool. She said her boyfriend ""hurt"" her.

A group of marines jump into the pool. 'Travis' then asks Katie if he would still be acceptable if he shaved his head like the raucous marines. She said he would NOT be acceptable, but the marines were ""very handsome."" This is a very ambivalent response to a pretty jealous boyfriend. The hair theme is pronounced in the film. It is a manlihood issue for 'Travis.' At one point Katie asks Jim what he uses on his hair. He doesn't answer.

The Marine discussion is one in a long series of actions, sex play and significant dialog between the couple that inform the violent end of the film.

'Travis' is ambivalent and a little jealous of those marines that broke up the tryst in the pool. Both the raucous marines and the jealousy theme echo in the rape scene near the end and the devastating Tsunami-like backlash later in the motel room.

There's a theme of isolation in the desert and in the two lovers' almost total separation from everyone as they wander from motel to desert and back again. The most extreme example of it is when the french-speaking Katy leaves the motel after an argument with 'Travis,' but then is so terrified at just the approach of a car on the street, that she finds herself forced to return to her lover's 'custody.' Figure it out, though. This woman does not speak English, while he does, and would not be able to explain herself to desert denizens and Los Angelenos. She has to go back to him and probably isn't that happy about returning.

At one point, the couple watches a father confess he had sex with their daughter to his wife on Jerry Springer. All along, Jim-'Travis' has been showing signs of abject soulessness in discussions with Katie. ""I feel sorry for her,""says Katie. ""For Who,"" asks Jim? ""The Mother,"" replies Katie. Then Katie asks Jim, ""would you do anything like that? ""Are you crazy,"" replies Jim, unconvincingly. Katie looks at Jim to try to divine whether he is lying. In the right circumstance Jim would have sex with his daughter. Jim turns and smiles. The move convinces Katie it is safe to leave Jim alone with her daughter should she ever have one.

The storyteller is showing us that these two have opted away from civilized ways. In a way, they DESERVE what happens to them for wandering outside the boundaries of civilization. The uncivilized sexual play of the two in deserted and lonely places is still another indication that these two are asking for it. Indeed, their behavior contains the seeds of their destruction.

Finally, there is a need to explain the final scene of a dead naked body in the desert while a lone policeman does a 360 around body and Hummer. There were two scenes in the hotel room, one of Travis stabbing Katie in a manner that mirrors physically what had happened to him in the desert. It should be noted that he has shaved his head in the way that Bickel did in Taxi Driver, a way that Katie has said she would not approve of on him, but WOULD APPROVE OF on the Marines in the pool. See the link between the thugs in the desert and the marines in the pool on the one hand, and the ironic sheering of Jim's own locks in the bathroom before his act of rage against Katie and the World. Jim is re-enacting exactly what happened to him in the desert, coiffed like the skinhead who raped him and the marines who made him jealous.

There's the scene of Jim poised over Katie's lifeless corpse on the bed, then one of the corpse alone on the bed.

So what is Jim doing out in the desert in the last scene? I think it is possible he went out looking for the guys in the white truck and found them. They then stripped him naked again and this time finished the job. A bigger likelihood is that Jim abandoned Katie's body in the motel, drove out to the exact place where he had been raped, and, partly in remorse and despair, partly out of hopelessness, cut his own throat with the same dull knife he first cut his hair with, and then offed Katie.

This might be somewhat hard for some to admit. I'll bet I wasn't the only male who laughed at the irony when the skinhead pulled Jim's pants below his bare rear end and had a go at him.

2100634,1,B0002KQNPO,"Others have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said.

Dumont makes a movie, somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s ""road"" movies, in which a couple, gets in a car and drives off, to nowhere in particular. I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along.

Katia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up.

The DVD includes a ""Director's note of intent"" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the ""note of intent"" the director finishes with ""Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct""

Well, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don't think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it. It is not the violence or sex, other movies have that but still have some redeeming values, photography, artistic creation. There is no redeeming value in this.

2100636,1,B0002KQNPO,"I can watch and enjoy a film showing people doing nothing special, but apparently there is a trick to making such a movie that is not known by Dumont.  Some of the Asian directors have a knack for capturing the emptiness in people's lives without putting us to sleep...I think of ""The Hole"" by Ming-liang Tsai.  I guess requirement number one would be that the characters must be interesting.  The couple in this movie are tedious...so is the script.

Twentynine Palms, with it's subtle anti-American undertone, is about two drab people in a monotonous setting who are dangerously boring.  They are not bad looking people, especially the female, but she dresses like a mental institution patient and she pretty much behaves that way as well.  The guy alternates between being a baby and a brute.  He is not man enough to ask a waitress in a Chinese restaurant what another customer is having so he can order the same (the girl asks for him), and he is constantly apologizing to the nut case female for various unknown offences, but he manages to batter her twice.  The girl in one scene bursts into tears for no apparent reason.  She leaves him at one point as if to return to L.A. alone.  Why does she suddenly want to leave?  I have no idea.  We are not shown anything that explains that development.  The scene that follows is pointless.

Some scenes are just silly.  In Dumont's mind, a Foster's Freeze drive in restaurant provides table service...as in a sit down cafe.  Also, in Dumont's fictional Foster's, customers eat ice cream and do not pay.

Oh yeah, there's sex, but aside from his yelling during climax which was laughable, there is no merit to the scenes.  The scenes are short and not at all erotic.

I didn't use it, but my finger toying with the fast forward button as I prayed for the ceiling in my room to fall and kill me, thereby taking me out of my misery.

If you HATE scenes, as I do, that depict injured dogs, STAY AWAY from this movie.  I was truly angered by that scene.  In my mind, I wanted use a baseball bat on Dumont's head, but in real life you would kill a person that way (keep that in mind if you must see this movie and manage to watch until the end.)

The ending is something that you would read on the frontpage and people would talk about for months.  It isn't a happy  ending.  If there was some sort of meaning or reason for the ending then I suppose it could be justified, but this was just senseless and disgusting.  It is a shame Amazon doesn't have negative ratings.",1099872000,7,465,4.530120481927711

You couldn't ask for two more unappealing characters. Who cares? At one point I was like, what is this, soft porn? Who wants to see this ugly creepy guy naked?!! Ugh. I sped through a lot of it and it still felt like one big snoozefest. The big shocking finale? This felt like an amateur film. Amazing how such bad movies get made.",1099440000,4,474,4.3977272727272725
8028495,5,B0002KQNPO,"I live in Joshua Tree, so this film was made in my backyard; Twentynine Palms, a fascinating dead end of a town. Nothing beyond it but increasingly rotted out houses of miners, loners and vagabonds long gone. This film is about pretentious L.A. types traveling to an area they consider trendy and cool. In actuality, it is a hard baked area with little commerce, lowest rung people surviving on the fringes. You start to notice that the L.A. couple are utterly self absorbed, bringing nothing in the way of kindness to the community. Quite selfish really; loud sex, outdoor sex, not paying for ice creams, etc...
Spoiler alert here.
This rather unlikable couple keep jeeping thru JT National Park, and at one point come upon an old house and two dogs, one of them with only three legs. L.A. dude ends up accidentally injuring the already maimed mutt, but the creature survives, and they drive off. Later in the film, a truck hijacks them, and three locals pull the couple from the jeep and do the worst thing that can be done to another man while the French L.A. chick is forced to watch. I watched this film right before bed, so was able to sleep on it;woke up realizing that this film is a gritty social commentary; Priviledged, trendy types vs. true poverty. The locals feel kicked while they are down, forgotten, like the poor three legged dog. And what they don't have in class and education they have in might, and boy, will they punch back! Not a safe world, and the foreboding feeling throughout this film never lets us forget it! It's a good art film, lots of suggestive symbolism. Personally, I think it is extremely apt in this age of Trump. I have seen trucks out here with TRUMP spelled out in Duct Tape for bumper stickers. You know there are sawed off shotguns in the back, and out here in the desert its not uncommon to come upon Militia looking structures with Confederate Flags flying high and proud. Its intense! This film, though made decades age, really captures this real thing that is a part of America and Ultra Trumpy. For the people who love the fringier films, enjoy!",1525737600,,2094,4.601604278074866
8028496,4,B0002KQNPO,"Two flawed people in a relationship of convenience--she's hot and willing to play the bad girl fantasy, he's loaded and is willing to look past her neurotic behavior as she does his possessiveness. The stories stark, the motives hidden in a look or sudden outburst, our boring lives told in the confines of security, the primal core ready to break out any second and put the scratches on the humvee, the overproduced sex acts, the pointless arguments made half in boredom and half to evade nature's overwhelming power to destroy--and suddenly your imagined securities gone, sex reverts to a pure manifestation of power, death reaches it's cold hand into your head and twists the handle. You'll never be the same.

I watched this while catching up on emails, making dinner, the everyday stuff, and with the subtitles off(I don't speak French) and think the worst thing you could do is stare at this movie and analyze every detail. S*** happens, and sometimes, it happens to you.",1382140800,,977,4.885542168674699

8028498,4,B0002KQNPO,29 Palms is about a couple on a getaway in the desert and it is a good love story with it ups and downs a lot of nudity but it is truly a good film you follow a couple on their journey doing things together with lots of sex and and exploring each others bodies it is good until the end when the couple is ran down and attacked by three men who apparently are on drugs the remove them from the vehicle the girl is stripped you think she is going to be raped but the beat the guy senseless and when his pants are pulled down you know what comes next warning the ending is brutal,1307059200,,576,3.889830508474576
8028499,3,B0002KQNPO,"Could someone please explain to me what happened here? I sat through this entire movie and then it abruptly ends.

Storyline and dialog are not the strong suits of this movie. It holds you, for whatever reason, but it's a blend of desert wanderers meets Deliverance.

I can't recommend that you do or don't watch it. Some degree of intoxication may be warranted, however, as the movie is downright bizarre. Lots of sex, if you're into that. Nice desert scenes, as well.

In terms of a plot ... well, you let me know.",1305849600,,516,4.526881720430108
8028500,1,B0002KQNPO,I thought this was going to be a mild lackluster movie until it got close to the end. There are two scenes that are very disturbing & not for the weak of heart. Movies do not usually stay with me but this one was so distubing it is still on my mind. I wish I had not bought this one. It made me stress.,1281744000,,302,3.734375
8028501,3,B0002KQNPO,"I just saw this film last night. I like checking out the amazon reviews of a film I've just seen sometimes, to see what other people thought. This film was challenging, ambiguous, and disturbing, so there are lots of differing opinions on it. It's open to interpretation in a lot of ways.

The main characters in the film are not very interesting or likable people. They're like many of the people we all have in the periphery of our lives: they're self-absorbed, bland, not particularly nice but not so hostile that they really stand out. They seem to be together for reasons that some might call ""the wrong reasons"" but are reasons that bring many people together anyway: he thinks she's hot and likes having sex with her, and she seems like the type of woman who needs a man to validate her. Aside from sexual attraction and neediness, there seems to be very little genuine affection or respect between the two of them. He thinks she's a hysterical, childish little girl, and she thinks he's a heartless, insensitive prick. Somehow the two interpret this as love.

Through most of the film, the two engage in mundane activities, bicker, and have histrionic, almost animalistic sex. Although it's all very slow moving and tedious, the film does a good job of providing a sense of impending dread and doom. It's subtle, but palpable ... you know something very, very bad is coming.

And it does. And when it does, it's brutal, horrifying, and fast. And all of a sudden all the petty bickering, adolescent drama, and superficial pain the two characters have spent the film inflicting on each other seem incredibly small compared to the abject horror that life can inflict upon anybody at any given time.",1269216000,2,1703,4.746621621621622

8028503,1,B0002KQNPO,"There are some movies that warrant reviews because they deserve one and there are some movies that warrant reviews as warnings to the unsuspecting viewer from watching celluloid junk made by someone who probably wasn't in the right frame of mind while making the movie.
I endured almost 2 hours of junk only because I wanted to push my limits of mental endurance and after watching this fare, I was very nearly at the end of my sanity and in serious danger of losing it.
The characters being shown in the movie (a crazy French couple from LA) are nasty at best, constantly fighting with each other, showing fits of sudden anger & love and then repeating the cycle all over again. The long periods of silence are flawed and in all probability the director (and crew) was lost whilst the camera rolled. The brutality and the sheer (bloody) violence shown in the movie (in my opinion) is a reflection of the director's personality. I cannot, but feel very sorry for the actors. I am sure, they only did this for money.
I was shocked at the end of the movie and disturbed. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. Please, stay away!!!",1229212800,3,1142,4.548543689320389
8028504,1,B0002KQNPO,"This is a particularly bad film.  It's extremely boring and tedious for the first hour or so.  The last half hour has a good night scene, and a shocking act of violence, but overall it's a pretentious, stupid film.  It consists of a very ugly couple (ugly on the inside mostly) screwing, yelling, screwing, and getting brutalised.  I am a fan of existential cinema, but this isn't a good example of it.  In fact, it's an embarrassment.  It's a shame, as the director, Bruno Dumont, previous film, L'humanite, is flatout amazing.  L'humanite had gotten some reviews from people thinking it's pretentious, slow (aka boring), and stupid, but it's a very powerful film with an incredible visual style to it.  This film isn't like that at all.  I think Dumont is a great filmmaker, but this is a bad misstep.  There seems to be a lot of posers out today making ""slow, ambiguous"" films in an attempt to be arty (there have always been posers of this kind throughout history, I suppose, so for us to think that they don't exist now is arrogance on our part).  I don't believe that Dumont is one of these posers, but many might think that he is if this is the only film of his they've seen.  Check out Dumont's L'humanite for proof of his talents, and ignore this film.  Thank you and good night.",1222819200,,1288,4.523809523809524
