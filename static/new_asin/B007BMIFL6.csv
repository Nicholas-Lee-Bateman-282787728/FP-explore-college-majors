5073481,5,B007BMIFL6,"Fantastic series, well worth the investment. Add this to your collection. Note there is no fan service. This series has a serious approach with plenty of comedy. A very enjoyable series. Be warned, there is likely another season following this one. Funnimation needs to make sure to produce season 3 on dvd.",1355097600,6,307,4.923076923076923
5073482,5,B007BMIFL6,I love this series. I don't understand why it was cancelled. Wish they would come out with season 3. Anyway this is a great anime. Definitely worth watching. And the S.A.V.E edition is a great way to get the less popular shows out there at a lower price. Thank you Funimation. :),1353024000,,279,4.384615384615385
5073483,5,B007BMIFL6,"D. Gray-Man is a fantastic anime about a young man named Allen Walker; who has a demon curse. Allen joins a group of exorcists that fight the Millennium Earl. The Millennium Earl is a demon who seeks to destroy the world by filling it with evil spirits. Allen Walker and his friends embark on a bloody battle to save innocent lives. D. Gray-Man is a very different series. The Gothic mixed with the supernatural creates a unique atmosphere. There are also lots of great characters, good and evil. Character development is the ""bread and butter"" of this anime. There are also many other awesome points: top notch animation, good soundtrack, and suspenseful action, as well as plenty of comic relief. If you are an anime fan and haven't watched this, I really want you give it a shot. It's very good.",1349568000,10,798,4.666666666666667

5073485,5,B007BMIFL6,"Which in reality, this is in of Season 1, as in Japan it goes up to episode 51 before rolling on to season 2. But anyway, to the review.
Well, clearly if you picked it up, you enjoyed Funi's season 1, so you already like it. So, I'm going to say something else. Yes, Funimation hasn't dubbed the rest, they're trying to get a hold of it, but Dentsu isn't lowing the price for the license. So, if you enjoy the series and have anime friends, tell them to buy the series, it'll help Funi get it in gear and get the rest. This series is a wonderful shonen series and it deserves to get finished.",1336608000,20,592,4.112068965517241

5073516,5,B007BMIFL6,"I looooooove D.Gray-man!  It's in my top 5 favorite anime of all time.  The only downside is that the series is on hold currently and there are only two seasons (I believe the manga also is incomplete).  I believe this is due to the creator having health issues but don't quote me on that.

D.Gray-man is dark and morbid, and occasionally a little bloody, but not gory really.  There's no explicit content either so far which I tend to prefer in the media I vew.  The world is very unique and the plot will keep you glued to the screen.  There are a couple humorous episodes here and there that had me laughing from start to finish, though most of the anime is very dark and heavy in quality.

All in all I highly recommend this anime.",1422662400,2,735,4.313868613138686

5073533,4,B007BMIFL6,"This is not the end of the series. Funimation did not buy all the rights to complete the series.
The anime is very good. I like the combination of action, comedy, and drama. The voice actors were good too.
I was totally bummed and disappointed with the fact that I couldn't see how it ended. :(",1402876800,15,294,4.267857142857143

We get even more detailed information of the innocence the exorcist order power. The Japanese and English voice actors do a great job of voicing the characters.
