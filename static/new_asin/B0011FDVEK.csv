3064872,4,B0011FDVEK,"I haven't finished watching all of the set yet.  MOSTLY because I can't stop playing Kismet.

Some people seem to pooh-pooh this film, but I am thoroughly enjoying the music (slices of Borodin from his various works turned into wonderful songs), the beautiful baritones of Howard Keel and Dolores Gray (heh, I'd argue for calling her range baritone - but I'm not try to bend any gender lines here - she's pure high-class vamp seducing Keel's character), the excellent voices of the juvenile pair (Vic Damone and Ann Blyth), and the incredible colors of Vincente Minnelli and the Technicolor system (Minnelli directed, but you can see his visual sense in every moment if you've studied his work a little, as I guess I have).  The plotline is hysterically funny if you pay attention (the twists of ""fate"" - they even give us a song to point this out early in the program).

My favorite melody is ""Night of My Nights"" which is incredibly short (less than 2.5 minutes), so I tend to repeat the chapter (#20, fyi) before going to the next scene.

I'd have loved a commentary track (that's how I learned about Minnelli - from other DVD's), but I do enjoy the extras provided.  Most interesting: the deleted (censored! Ha!) Rahadlakum prelude, and the television program (MGM Parade) segments promoting the film. (It's funny to hear Jane Powell, on another disk, telling us that MGM wouldn't allow stars to be photographed next to a television set, but here's a TV program created by MGM specifically to promote their movies; perhaps she was referring to an earlier time).

For people who don't want to invest in the entire box set, I've seen rumors that individual disks might be released in July.

Also, if you'd like a deeper appreciation of ""Hit the Deck"", I'd suggest you read what's been written on the soundtrack album page.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hit-the-Deck-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack-Re-release-of-1955-Film/dp/B00004ZDYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hit the Deck: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Re-release of 1955 Film)</a>",1208736000,32,2091,5.353658536585366
3064873,4,B0011FDVEK,"Not bought this yet but soon will! It is good that MGM are getting more of their back catalogue out to us. A mixed bag they may be, but there are some gems contained in this set. 'Kismet' is still a good film with a wonderful score, 'Lady Be Good' has that unforgettable scene where Ann Southern 'composes' the title song in a few minutes ... and Broadway Melody 1938 with Sophie Tucker - what style! Keep rolling them out MGM there are still many more to think about - The Great Caruso, The Student Prince, The Great Waltz, Little Nelly Kelly, Thousands Cheer, Yolanda and the Thief, Invitation to the Dance, Three Darling Daughters, Summer Holiday - to name a few!",1206489600,2,666,4.467213114754099
3064874,3,B0011FDVEK,"Seems to me there are many more MGM musicals of the fifites and sixties that need an airing before some of these chestnuts. Pleased to see ""Hit the Deck"". ""Deep in my Heart"", but the others don't do it for me.
I think if we could now have ""the Great Caruso"", ""The Student Prince"", ""Goodbye Mr Chips(69), ""the Boyfriend"",""Athena"", ""Give a Girl a Break"", ""I love Melvin"", Rose Marie""(54)we would have pretty much all the MGM musicals.",1205539200,6,432,4.623376623376624
3064875,4,B0011FDVEK,"This package, as others have mentioned, appears to be a mixed bag of musicals not yet on DVD. The good news is that some of the Eleanor Powell films I've been waiting for are among them - Broadway Melodies of 1936 and 1938, Born To Dance, and Lady Be Good. I'm less crazy about the 1950's era musicals in this package. Personally I'd say that the Broadway Melodies and Born to Dance are 5/5, Lady Be Good is 4/5, and the 1950's era films are between 3 and 4 out of 5. It's not that I don't like Jane Powell, the star of many of the later entries, it's just that the stories in some of these films seems to be more of a hindrance than a help. Nobody else has listed the extra features, which are essential when judging a package like this.

3064876,5,B0011FDVEK,"At last we can see again these nostalgic and delightful titles. When ""Esther Williams, Vol. 2"", ""Betty Grable, Vol. 2"", ""Alice Faye, Vol. 2"", Ann Blyth's ""Rose Marie"", ""The student prince"" and ""The great Caruso"", ""Athena"", ""Yolanda and the thief"", ""Doris Day, vol. 3""...? I would be even delighted to be able to see once more those tiny poor musicals with Judy Canova from Republic.",1199923200,9,382,4.892307692307693
3064877,3,B0011FDVEK,"This is a rather odd combination of MGM musicals, possible the result of the scraping together some of the titles which had not yet appeared on DVD. They are certainly a variable lot falling into 3 subgroups - 4 with Eleanor Powell, 2 starring Jane Powell and 3 second rate titles from the fifties.

In the late thirties, Eleanor Powell became the dancing queen of MGM with her spectacular tap. She only made at most 2 films per annum and each had large, superb supporting casts and great songs to showcase her. If you have not seen Powell's dancing, you are in for a treat. The production numbers have a glitter and excitement with the shiny black and white photography and dynamic orchestrations and fortunately, the prints have been restored and are in excellent condition.
- ""Broadway Melody of 1936"", released in 1935, was Powell's first MGM film and it is masterfully made to disguise her acting limitations. The film has a great score including ""Broadway Rhythm"" and ""You are my Lucky Star"", both appearing later in ""Singing in the Rain"". With Frances Langford to belt out the songs, Robert Taylor as an impossibly handsome leading man, Jack Benny playing a Walter Winchell like reporter, Buddy Ebsen with his sister Vilma for goofy dancing and Una Merkel for the wiscracks, the film was a great success and spawned a series of films with ""Broadway Melody"" in the title.
- The next in the series, released in 1936, was ""Born to Dance"", using the familiar plot of 3 sailors and their girls. Ebsen, Langford and Una Merkel were back with Taylor replaced by James Stewart who introduces the classic Col Porter ""Easy to Love"" in an uneasy vocal. The other great song is ""I've got you under my Skin"" presented by Virginia Bruce.
- For 1937, the ""Broadway Melody"" title returned with Robert Taylor once again as a harried producer. Sophie Tucker and a very young Judy Garland are added to the formula. Tucker performs her signature ""Some of These Days"", and Garland, in her MGM feature debut, has 2 stand out songs; ""Everybody Sing"" and the specially interpolated ""Dear Mr Gable"", a version of ""You made me Love You"". George Murphy dances with Powell and they make a delightful team. This one has a subplot concerning a horse race and the plot becomes tiresome. Also, the editing is faulty with some poor matching of shots.
- In ""Lady be Good"", released in 1941, Powell had been demoted from the lead. She supports Ann Sothern and Robert Young in a really boring and overlong story of a song writing team. Busby Berkeley staged the finale, George Gershwin's ""Fascinating Rhythmn"", with Powell in great form. The other highlight is the touching ""The Last Time I saw Paris"", poignantly delivered by Ann Sothern and the winner of the Oscar for best song that year. It is ironical that Powell was relegated to the second lead here  because she is much more relaxed and attractive than in the earlier films.

In the late forties, Joe Pasternak produced a series of light ""family"" musical comedies starring Jane Powell. These films date badly although the two titles here are probably the best in the series. The films are well made in glorious technicolour and Jane Powell's work always improved.
- the title, ""Nancy goes to Rio"", says it all. Ugh! This is a film in the mould of Gidget and is fairly nauseating, to say the least. It certainly  benefits from the presence of Ann Sothern as Powell's mother and there are a few pleasant songs, but otherwise, the cringe meter will score high. Carmen Miranda is on hand too but by this time, she had become a parody. Her musical numbers are OK but the sexy insinuation in her best Fox films is replaced by MGM family values and that kills Miranda stone dead!
- ""Two weeks with Love"" is a better film. It has an amusing screenplay, an excellent supporting cast and Powell is quite funny although Debbie Reynolds, with a naturalness that was soon to disappear, steals the film as her younger sister. Her duet with Carleton Carpenter of ""Aba daba Honeymoon"" is famous.

The last 3 films are a real mixed bag. MGM continued to make the grandest musicals of all the studios but by the mid fifties, the films were becoming increasingly heavy handed.
- ""Deep in my Heart"" is an all star biopic of Sigmund Romberg with a charmless Jose Ferrer showcased in the title role and a dreary screenplay. The biographic film allowed guest appearances by the studio roster and Ann Miller steals the show, closely followed by Gene Kelly, dancing with his brother.
- ""Hit the Deck"" is another version of the cliched yarn about sailors on shore leave and the musicals numbers, often dynamic, save the viewer from complete boredom, the best being ""Hallelujah"". The cast are competent and energetic but generally second rate when compared to ""On the Town"" to which it has many similarities.
- ""Kismet"" is a technicolour Arabian Nights yarn which was a great Broadway hit but is another boring and overproduced dinosaur. Howard Keel was always good and how he managed to keep a straight face with some of the material he was handed is a credit to him. Dolores Gray jumps off the screen but Ann Blyth and the others are awful. Films such as these killed the musical genre stone dead.

The Set contains the usual assortment of outtakes (some good, some awful), cartoons, trailers etc. The best extra is the interview with a charming Jane Powell and it is great to see an ex-movie star who both looks good and has happy memories. The prints of the films are generally good.

So there you have it. If you like musicals, you may like all these titles. Personally, I would prefer a disk which just contained the musical numbers. Incidentally, that's the cast of ""Lady be Good"" displayed on Amazon.",1198713600,110,5710,4.704
3064878,5,B0011FDVEK,"Nice announcement of more classic musicals from MGM.  The nine titles are just fine.  Who could ask for anything more.  Well maybe a few others like YOLANDA AND THE THEIF; THE OPPOSITE SEX; SKIRTS AHOY; RICH, YOUNG AND PRETTY; A DATE WITH JUDY.  Maybe the next batch will include those and more.  Thanks Warners for these titles.  There is some fine musical numbers to be had in these films, especially in the underated DEEP IN MY HEART.  Keep em' comin'.",1198108800,15,455,4.6125
3064899,4,B0011FDVEK,This set has some good musicals with comedy on the side. Just like most musicals they are light and breezy. To be honest I didn't really like some of the movies. They seemed a bit overdone. Other than that it is a good collection. Jane Powell's performances are good and Eleanor Powell's dancing is phenomenal,1356480000,,309,4.636363636363637
3064900,3,B0011FDVEK,"Apart from the exquisite Kismet, nearly all of these film musicals look very dated and a little boring in most cases.
Although they seem to be sincerely produced and directed, many of them do not provide the quality entertainment that Hollywood is famous for - especially the later musicals, which were in colour and contained excellent choreography and well presented musical scores and singing.
These musicals appeared before the American Film Musical Industry matured into world class entertainment.",1316304000,,502,5.448717948717949
3064901,4,B0011FDVEK,"This collection has lots of wonderful old musicals with lots of dancing and singing.  Some are in color and some are in black and white.  The quality of the photography is that of the earlier era, i.e., not the HiDef of today.

These movies are loaded with famous stars.  For example, in ""Born to Dance"" Jimmy Stewart costars with tap dancer Eleanor Powell.  Stewart sings and tap dances.  Buddy Ebsen shows his skill as a dancer with a solo number.

The quality of the tap dancing is great, the ballroom dancing is lovely.  The plots are transparent, nothing serious.  The whole effect is the light hearted entertainment of an earlier era.",1306627200,3,640,4.693693693693693
3064902,5,B0011FDVEK,I mainly purchased this package because it was the only way to get KISMET. I know that the movie was no acadamy award winner but I love the music and Howard Keel. The package contains  six discs. I will be giving my mother (she is 93) two of these  discs with the movies from the 30's. The movie quality was excellent. If you are a old movie musical buff this is for you.,1288569600,5,371,4.068493150684931
3064903,5,B0011FDVEK,"Yes, a factory it was, with an assembly line that churned out quality products regularly, year after year, like Ford turned out automobiles, and this package provides an entertaining overview of the lesser musicals MGM marketed from the nineteen-thirties to the fifties.  I'm sure they weren't meant to be 'lesser' products at the time - everything MGM produced was deemed important, but this lot were certainly overshadowed by the Freed-Kelly vehicles.

Here we see the tried and trusted employees strutting their stuff.  There's Eleanor Powell, elevated to stardom and carefully presented in the ""Broadway Melody"" series....then reduced to playing second fiddle to Ann Sothern and Robert Young in ""Lady be Good"" before being dropped off the assembly line altogether after a couple of Red Skelton comedies.  Eleanor's main drawback was that she was a dazzling solo dancer, but unlike Ginger, Rita, & Co. was never at her best in a duo..  In fact, in ""Lady Be Good"" it's not a male partner, but a cute little dog that partners her brilliantly...and sadly, just when they decided to downgrade her, she gives  a far more relaxed performance than in her heyday.  This collection also gives us the opportunity to watch other fresh. young talents like Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds groomed and packaged in properties designed to showcase them, while former luminaries - like Ann Sothern and Walter Pidgeon take a step back to support them.

And then there's a couple of near-misses.  ""Kismet"" should have been great.  It's not.  It has a great score, fine singing and lavish production values....but one expects just that little bit extra from Vincente Minnelli.  It's rumored he was too distracted by his next project (""Lust for Life"") to pay much attention to this musical, which is sad.  There is a 'tossed off"" uncaring feeling about this one...and it deserved better.  ""Deep in My Heart"" suffers from its leads - the volatile but charmless Jose Ferrer and the Wagnerian pudding, Helen Traubel  They both do their best (and Traubel has a great voice),
but they make heavy going.  Main advantage is the showcasing of many MGM stars in guest appearances....including Ann Miller, who regularly popped up on the assembly line to add pep and vitality to so many musicals.

Extras are minimal insofar as ones that relate to the actual movies.  There are the usual cartoons, and short subjects, but only one interview -with Jane Powell, which is great.  She's informative, charming...and towards the end she becomes endearingly emotional, and I joined her in her tears.  An outtake from ""Deep in My Heart"" shows an extremely uncomfortable - and probably resentful - Esther Williams uneasily  descending a staircase as the finale of a drab and ugly number by George Murphy.  No wonder it was dropped.

I give this collection full marks, because even when its musicals dropped a little below standard, MGM still invested more talent, more inventiveness, better scripts, and creative skills into its output.  Ten minutes of any one of these musicals contains more pizazz then the entire lumbering mess that was ""Mamma Mia"".",1257984000,3,3114,5.048923679060666
3064904,4,B0011FDVEK,"My thanks to ""calvinnme"" for all the technical specifics on the individual films. I find that sort of info very useful and appreciate it.

The only thing left out was aspect ratio. I am pleased to be able to report that all are labeled as ""preserving the aspect ratio of [its] original theatrical exhibition."" That means 2.55:1 for both ""Hit the Deck"" and ""Kismet"" and 1.75:1 for ""Deep in My Heart."" I verified the three widescreen films on my computer monitor and actually measured them. The others, of course, produced before the advent of CinemaScope, Panavision, etc. in the early 50's, are all 4:3 or 1.33:1.

I have a relatively new LCD TV and don't like to buy ""standard"" format DVDs if the movies were originally filmed in a wider format. I hate cropped films.",1228176000,7,768,4.681481481481481

A lot of attention has been paid to sensitive restoration, providing outstanding quality of picture and sound.

From various collections, such as the ""That's Entertainment"" series I knew there are marvelous scenes in the other 2 Broadway Melodies (1936 and 1938).
Well, let me tell you, to me those turned out to be very special. In ""Broadway Melody of 1936"" Buddy Epsen dances with his talented sister (who only made this one movie). In ""Broadway Melody of 1938"" he also dances up a storm. Judy Garland sings her famous song about Clark Gable.
I knew nothing about ""Nancy Goes to Rio"" and ""Two Weeks with Love"" before viewing the collection. They are both so entertaining they need to be seen. The same can be said for all the other musicals in the collection.

Some people seem to pooh-pooh this film, but I am thoroughly enjoying the music (slices of Borodin from his various works turned into wonderful songs), the beautiful baritones of Howard Keel and Dolores Gray (heh, I'd argue for calling her range baritone - but I'm not try to bend any gender lines here - she's pure high-class vamp seducing Keel's character), the excellent voices of the juvenile pair (Vic Damone and Ann Blyth), and the incredible colors of Vincente Minnelli and the Technicolor system (Minnelli directed, but you can see his visual sense in every moment if you've studied his work a little, as I guess I have).  The plotline is hysterically funny if you pay attention (the twists of ""fate"" - they even give us a song to point this out early in the program).

My favorite melody is ""Night of My Nights"" which is incredibly short (less than 2.5 minutes), so I tend to repeat the chapter (#20, fyi) before going to the next scene.

I'd have loved a commentary track (that's how I learned about Minnelli - from other DVD's), but I do enjoy the extras provided.  Most interesting: the deleted (censored! Ha!) Rahadlakum prelude, and the television program (MGM Parade) segments promoting the film. (It's funny to hear Jane Powell, on another disk, telling us that MGM wouldn't allow stars to be photographed next to a television set, but here's a TV program created by MGM specifically to promote their movies; perhaps she was referring to an earlier time).

For people who don't want to invest in the entire box set, I've seen rumors that individual disks might be released in July.

Also, if you'd like a deeper appreciation of ""Hit the Deck"", I'd suggest you read what's been written on the soundtrack album page.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hit-the-Deck-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack-Re-release-of-1955-Film/dp/B00004ZDYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hit the Deck: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Re-release of 1955 Film)</a>",1208736000,32,2091,5.353658536585366

3299372,4,B0011FDVEK,"This package, as others have mentioned, appears to be a mixed bag of musicals not yet on DVD. The good news is that some of the Eleanor Powell films I've been waiting for are among them - Broadway Melodies of 1936 and 1938, Born To Dance, and Lady Be Good. I'm less crazy about the 1950's era musicals in this package. Personally I'd say that the Broadway Melodies and Born to Dance are 5/5, Lady Be Good is 4/5, and the 1950's era films are between 3 and 4 out of 5. It's not that I don't like Jane Powell, the star of many of the later entries, it's just that the stories in some of these films seems to be more of a hindrance than a help.

3299373,5,B0011FDVEK,"At last we can see again these nostalgic and delightful titles. When ""Esther Williams, Vol. 2"", ""Betty Grable, Vol. 2"", ""Alice Faye, Vol. 2"", Ann Blyth's ""Rose Marie"", ""The student prince"" and ""The great Caruso"", ""Athena"", ""Yolanda and the thief"", ""Doris Day, vol. 3""...? I would be even delighted to be able to see once more those tiny poor musicals with Judy Canova from Republic.",1199923200,9,382,4.892307692307693
3299374,3,B0011FDVEK,"This is a rather odd combination of MGM musicals, possible the result of the scraping together some of the titles which had not yet appeared on DVD. They are certainly a variable lot falling into 3 subgroups - 4 with Eleanor Powell, 2 starring Jane Powell and 3 second rate titles from the fifties.

In the late thirties, Eleanor Powell became the dancing queen of MGM with her spectacular tap. She only made at most 2 films per annum and each had large, superb supporting casts and great songs to showcase her. If you have not seen Powell's dancing, you are in for a treat. The production numbers have a glitter and excitement with the shiny black and white photography and dynamic orchestrations and fortunately, the prints have been restored and are in excellent condition.
- ""Broadway Melody of 1936"", released in 1935, was Powell's first MGM film and it is masterfully made to disguise her acting limitations. The film has a great score including ""Broadway Rhythm"" and ""You are my Lucky Star"", both appearing later in ""Singing in the Rain"". With Frances Langford to belt out the songs, Robert Taylor as an impossibly handsome leading man, Jack Benny playing a Walter Winchell like reporter, Buddy Ebsen with his sister Vilma for goofy dancing and Una Merkel for the wiscracks, the film was a great success and spawned a series of films with ""Broadway Melody"" in the title.
- The next in the series, released in 1936, was ""Born to Dance"", using the familiar plot of 3 sailors and their girls. Ebsen, Langford and Una Merkel were back with Taylor replaced by James Stewart who introduces the classic Col Porter ""Easy to Love"" in an uneasy vocal. The other great song is ""I've got you under my Skin"" presented by Virginia Bruce.
- For 1937, the ""Broadway Melody"" title returned with Robert Taylor once again as a harried producer. Sophie Tucker and a very young Judy Garland are added to the formula. Tucker performs her signature ""Some of These Days"", and Garland, in her MGM feature debut, has 2 stand out songs; ""Everybody Sing"" and the specially interpolated ""Dear Mr Gable"", a version of ""You made me Love You"". George Murphy dances with Powell and they make a delightful team. This one has a subplot concerning a horse race and the plot becomes tiresome. Also, the editing is faulty with some poor matching of shots.
- In ""Lady be Good"", released in 1941, Powell had been demoted from the lead. She supports Ann Sothern and Robert Young in a really boring and overlong story of a song writing team. Busby Berkeley staged the finale, George Gershwin's ""Fascinating Rhythmn"", with Powell in great form. The other highlight is the touching ""The Last Time I saw Paris"", poignantly delivered by Ann Sothern and the winner of the Oscar for best song that year. It is ironical that Powell was relegated to the second lead here  because she is much more relaxed and attractive than in the earlier films.

In the late forties, Joe Pasternak produced a series of light ""family"" musical comedies starring Jane Powell. These films date badly although the two titles here are probably the best in the series. The films are well made in glorious technicolour and Jane Powell's work always improved.
- the title, ""Nancy goes to Rio"", says it all. Ugh! This is a film in the mould of Gidget and is fairly nauseating, to say the least. It certainly  benefits from the presence of Ann Sothern as Powell's mother and there are a few pleasant songs, but otherwise, the cringe meter will score high. Carmen Miranda is on hand too but by this time, she had become a parody. Her musical numbers are OK but the sexy insinuation in her best Fox films is replaced by MGM family values and that kills Miranda stone dead!
- ""Two weeks with Love"" is a better film. It has an amusing screenplay, an excellent supporting cast and Powell is quite funny although Debbie Reynolds, with a naturalness that was soon to disappear, steals the film as her younger sister. Her duet with Carleton Carpenter of ""Aba daba Honeymoon"" is famous.

The last 3 films are a real mixed bag. MGM continued to make the grandest musicals of all the studios but by the mid fifties, the films were becoming increasingly heavy handed.
- ""Deep in my Heart"" is an all star biopic of Sigmund Romberg with a charmless Jose Ferrer showcased in the title role and a dreary screenplay. The biographic film allowed guest appearances by the studio roster and Ann Miller steals the show, closely followed by Gene Kelly, dancing with his brother.
- ""Hit the Deck"" is another version of the cliched yarn about sailors on shore leave and the musicals numbers, often dynamic, save the viewer from complete boredom, the best being ""Hallelujah"". The cast are competent and energetic but generally second rate when compared to ""On the Town"" to which it has many similarities.
- ""Kismet"" is a technicolour Arabian Nights yarn which was a great Broadway hit but is another boring and overproduced dinosaur. Howard Keel was always good and how he managed to keep a straight face with some of the material he was handed is a credit to him. Dolores Gray jumps off the screen but Ann Blyth and the others are awful. Films such as these killed the musical genre stone dead.

The Set contains the usual assortment of outtakes (some good, some awful), cartoons, trailers etc. The best extra is the interview with a charming Jane Powell and it is great to see an ex-movie star who both looks good and has happy memories. The prints of the films are generally good.

So there you have it. If you like musicals, you may like all these titles. Personally, I would prefer a disk which just contained the musical numbers. Incidentally, that's the cast of ""Lady be Good"" displayed on Amazon.",1198713600,110,5710,4.704
3299375,5,B0011FDVEK,"Nice announcement of more classic musicals from MGM.  The nine titles are just fine.  Who could ask for anything more.  Well maybe a few others like YOLANDA AND THE THEIF; THE OPPOSITE SEX; SKIRTS AHOY; RICH, YOUNG AND PRETTY; A DATE WITH JUDY.  Maybe the next batch will include those and more.  Thanks Warners for these titles.  There is some fine musical numbers to be had in these films, especially in the underated DEEP IN MY HEART.  Keep em' comin'.",1198108800,15,455,4.6125
3299396,4,B0011FDVEK,This set has some good musicals with comedy on the side. Just like most musicals they are light and breezy. To be honest I didn't really like some of the movies. They seemed a bit overdone. Other than that it is a good collection. Jane Powell's performances are good and Eleanor Powell's dancing is phenomenal,1356480000,,309,4.636363636363637
3299397,3,B0011FDVEK,"Apart from the exquisite Kismet, nearly all of these film musicals look very dated and a little boring in most cases.
Although they seem to be sincerely produced and directed, many of them do not provide the quality entertainment that Hollywood is famous for - especially the later musicals, which were in colour and contained excellent choreography and well presented musical scores and singing.
These musicals appeared before the American Film Musical Industry matured into world class entertainment.",1316304000,,502,5.448717948717949
3299398,4,B0011FDVEK,"This collection has lots of wonderful old musicals with lots of dancing and singing.  Some are in color and some are in black and white.  The quality of the photography is that of the earlier era, i.e., not the HiDef of today.

These movies are loaded with famous stars.  For example, in ""Born to Dance"" Jimmy Stewart costars with tap dancer Eleanor Powell.  Stewart sings and tap dances.  Buddy Ebsen shows his skill as a dancer with a solo number.

The quality of the tap dancing is great, the ballroom dancing is lovely.  The plots are transparent, nothing serious.  The whole effect is the light hearted entertainment of an earlier era.",1306627200,3,640,4.693693693693693
3299399,5,B0011FDVEK,I mainly purchased this package because it was the only way to get KISMET. I know that the movie was no acadamy award winner but I love the music and Howard Keel. The package contains  six discs. I will be giving my mother (she is 93) two of these  discs with the movies from the 30's. The movie quality was excellent. If you are a old movie musical buff this is for you.,1288569600,5,371,4.068493150684931
3299400,5,B0011FDVEK,"Yes, a factory it was, with an assembly line that churned out quality products regularly, year after year, like Ford turned out automobiles, and this package provides an entertaining overview of the lesser musicals MGM marketed from the nineteen-thirties to the fifties.  I'm sure they weren't meant to be 'lesser' products at the time - everything MGM produced was deemed important, but this lot were certainly overshadowed by the Freed-Kelly vehicles.

Here we see the tried and trusted employees strutting their stuff.  There's Eleanor Powell, elevated to stardom and carefully presented in the ""Broadway Melody"" series....then reduced to playing second fiddle to Ann Sothern and Robert Young in ""Lady be Good"" before being dropped off the assembly line altogether after a couple of Red Skelton comedies.  Eleanor's main drawback was that she was a dazzling solo dancer, but unlike Ginger, Rita, & Co. was never at her best in a duo..  In fact, in ""Lady Be Good"" it's not a male partner, but a cute little dog that partners her brilliantly...and sadly, just when they decided to downgrade her, she gives  a far more relaxed performance than in her heyday.  This collection also gives us the opportunity to watch other fresh. young talents like Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds groomed and packaged in properties designed to showcase them, while former luminaries - like Ann Sothern and Walter Pidgeon take a step back to support them.

And then there's a couple of near-misses.  ""Kismet"" should have been great.  It's not.  It has a great score, fine singing and lavish production values....but one expects just that little bit extra from Vincente Minnelli.  It's rumored he was too distracted by his next project (""Lust for Life"") to pay much attention to this musical, which is sad.  There is a 'tossed off"" uncaring feeling about this one...and it deserved better.  ""Deep in My Heart"" suffers from its leads - the volatile but charmless Jose Ferrer and the Wagnerian pudding, Helen Traubel  They both do their best (and Traubel has a great voice),
but they make heavy going.  Main advantage is the showcasing of many MGM stars in guest appearances....including Ann Miller, who regularly popped up on the assembly line to add pep and vitality to so many musicals.

Extras are minimal insofar as ones that relate to the actual movies.  There are the usual cartoons, and short subjects, but only one interview -with Jane Powell, which is great.  She's informative, charming...and towards the end she becomes endearingly emotional, and I joined her in her tears.  An outtake from ""Deep in My Heart"" shows an extremely uncomfortable - and probably resentful - Esther Williams uneasily  descending a staircase as the finale of a drab and ugly number by George Murphy.  No wonder it was dropped.

I give this collection full marks, because even when its musicals dropped a little below standard, MGM still invested more talent, more inventiveness, better scripts, and creative skills into its output.  Ten minutes of any one of these musicals contains more pizazz then the entire lumbering mess that was ""Mamma Mia"".",1257984000,3,3114,5.048923679060666
3299401,4,B0011FDVEK,"My thanks to ""calvinnme"" for all the technical specifics on the individual films. I find that sort of info very useful and appreciate it.

The only thing left out was aspect ratio. I am pleased to be able to report that all are labeled as ""preserving the aspect ratio of [its] original theatrical exhibition."" That means 2.55:1 for both ""Hit the Deck"" and ""Kismet"" and 1.75:1 for ""Deep in My Heart."" I verified the three widescreen films on my computer monitor and actually measured them. The others, of course, produced before the advent of CinemaScope, Panavision, etc. in the early 50's, are all 4:3 or 1.33:1.

I have a relatively new LCD TV and don't like to buy ""standard"" format DVDs if the movies were originally filmed in a wider format. I hate cropped films.",1228176000,7,768,4.681481481481481

From various collections, such as the ""That's Entertainment"" series I knew there are marvelous scenes in the other 2 Broadway Melodies (1936 and 1938).
Well, let me tell you, to me those turned out to be very special. In ""Broadway Melody of 1936"" Buddy Epsen dances with his talented sister (who only made this one movie). In ""Broadway Melody of 1938"" he also dances up a storm. Judy Garland sings her famous song about Clark Gable.

8241681,5,B0011FDVEK,"This box presents a number of rare and hard-to-see films (in the UK at least) and allowed me to finally view the Broadway Melody of 1936 - and wow, what a gorgeous print! The quality is nothing less than sensational yet nobody has commented on it here! The movie is a delight and may be the quintessential 1930s musical film. All of the films in the set have been lovingly transferred from excellent source elements and all come with a generous helping of unique bonus features. I especially loved the rare ""Hollywood Hotel"" broadcast for BORN TO DANCE (1936)
The box set offered incredible value for money for a film buff like me. Thank you so much MGM!!!",1394064000,4,656,4.567796610169491
