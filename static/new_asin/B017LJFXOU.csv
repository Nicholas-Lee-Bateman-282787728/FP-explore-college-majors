7507879,5,B017LJFXOU,I bought a few of Scott Cole's Tai Chi DVDs for my Mom at Christmas since she was looking for a good no impact workout alternative. She raved about how great they made her feel and she had lost 10lbs in just about 1 1/2 months. Fast forward a few months. I purchased some more for her so she wouldn't get bored and I decided to buy a few for myself. Not only was I pleasantly surprised (this type A went in a little skeptical) but I really worked up a sweat! I feel energized and I feel like I got a great workout in too. I highly recommend this to anyone of any age!,1466553600,10,567,3.9391304347826086
7507880,3,B017LJFXOU,"I have all of Scott Cole's dvds.  I really like him, the way he instructs and his relaxing voice.  Where this was a good workout it was the same moves as in all of his other dvds.  The bonus section offered two new ones, but basically it was just the same old routine nothing really new.",1466294400,2,287,4.089285714285714
7507881,5,B017LJFXOU,"nice, relaxing but I feel energized after. Good for me because my state of stress has not allowed me to take on maximal intense workouts but I want to move ,keep the joints supple and mobile and still do good by my body and mind. This helps",1462320000,9,240,4.127659574468085
7507882,4,B017LJFXOU,Short but I like his approach. Although clearly for beginners you can take things deeper. A nice DVD to use for a midday 'movement' break.,1458777600,3,138,4.56

8739658,5,B017LJFXOU,"I work out with my Mom and a friend who both need a seated routine. This is very much like a great light yoga workout. Short enough to fit easily into our routine and easy enough for a sedentary 78 year old and a 60 year old with Parkinson's, I still felt like I got a great little workout. Plus the stretching felt amazing and helped my back. I liked the relaxing music too.",1526774400,,375,4.081081081081081
8739659,2,B017LJFXOU,"Definitely not for seniors. My mom started doing the entire routine and she hurt her back after about a week. Some parts are good, but some portions of the routine are too much for a senior",1515369600,,189,4.277777777777778
8739660,5,B017LJFXOU,"Who I am:
I'm a 70 yr old grandma.  I have a pinched nerve and arthritis in my lumbar spine which causes pain and weakness in my right leg.  I cannot walk very far without a cane or walker.  However, I CAN walk around the house without assistance.  I've been sedentary for too long, having worked for many years at a desk and now, in retirement, I spend too much time sitting in a chair.
I just purchased this DVD, and I'm happy with it.  This is a very gentle workout.  It begins with standing moves while holding onto the back of a chair, which I have no problem with.  After about 10 or 15 minutes of standing moves (done slowly), he instructs you to sit.  You can see one of the sitting moves in the picture.  It's not easy for me to get my leg up on top of the other knee like that, but I DID manage it.
Many of the ""movements"" are yoga-based.  He DOES tell you when to breathe.
From the back of the DVD case: ""Designed to increase balance and stability, the Standing Section offers easy-to-follow upper and lower body strength and stretching exercises that activate and elongate all major muscle groups.  With special emphasis on breathing and body awareness, the Seated Section covers non-weight bearing therapeutic range of motion exercises, functional applications, and a full-body stretch....."".
Toward the end of the seated section, Scott gives instructions for practicing the art of getting up and down from a seated position, including the proper way to get in & out of a car.
To summarize:  I will keep and continue to use this DVD.  I have quite a few in my DVD library - yoga with Peggy Cappy, and almost all of Anne Pringle Burnell's DVD's.  This DVD is a nice addition!",1498348800,11,1687,4.470588235294118
8739661,5,B017LJFXOU,"Scott Cole does an excellent job of instructing on his DVD's.  He goes slow enough to make it easy to follow.  I've tried DVD's from other instructors, but I think he does the best job.  This DVD is a great routine.  I would definitely recommend it.",1490572800,3,249,4.3478260869565215
8739662,5,B017LJFXOU,"Scott Cole makes Yoga fun. He instructs with confidence along with humor. Anyone can do this video, I'm 63 not very flexible but I do what I can and feel good after the workout.",1490140800,5,177,4.235294117647059
