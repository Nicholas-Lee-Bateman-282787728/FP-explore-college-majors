3758653,5,B001PR2186,I was 12 years old when this series started and forgot just how good it was until I just bought it to add to my collection and started watching it again. I also got Time Tunnel awhile back and it is fun to watch to. You can't go wrong with adding this to you DVD collection. Now I'm waiting for Land of the Giants to reduce in price and I'll get that next! Just plain fun!,1387843200,,372,3.9078947368421053
3758654,5,B001PR2186,this  product brings to mind times that we gathered as a family to watch tv. this was science fiction at its best during this time period.,1369094400,,138,4.3076923076923075
3758655,5,B001PR2186,these tapes are really great  and very well made.  it's really great to be able to see the old shows and remember the good days,1368748800,,127,4.04
3758656,5,B001PR2186,"If you want a great set of DVDs from a terrific series, this is the one for you.  Voyage is a much better series than anything on today.  We call it Star Trek under the ocean.  Richard Basehart is awesome as Admiral Nelson.  Glad to have it.",1366243200,,241,4.0638297872340425

3758658,5,B001PR2186,Voyage to the Bottom is one of the best TV shows of all time. The special effects for this 1960's show is better then most million dollar movies today. This show was well written and plot's are outstanding and the sets and the Sub is so realistic all the underwater scenes are outstanding. The cast worked great together i am at the first year which is not color but if it was the under water scenes would be just beautiful. If have young children or teenagers or grandkids and tired of the trash on TV please get this set. If you are one of those man made global warming nuts you would love this show as well this show was way ahead of it's time. If your in your 50's like me you will fall back in love with this show i bought the whole set and everytime i watch a show i am glued to the TV set. Please if want good family intertainment this is the set to get plus get the Midnight Special dvd set as well that is another DVD SET that your whole family can enjoy THEN THE TRASH on the radio with all the cussing and angryness and the degrading of women. If could i would go back in time and live back in the 60's and 70's it was so much better time even with the problems we had back in that time.,1327449600,3,1198,3.995833333333333
3758659,5,B001PR2186,"After much thought about whether to get this set or buy the discs individually, I finally settled on this. It was cheaper and this set is well worth the money! Voyage is similar to the original Star Trek, a series ahead of its time! Love it!

I can't understand why they left out the season 4 vol 2 disc though, nevertheless highly recommended!",1326153600,3,344,4.4603174603174605
3758660,5,B001PR2186,"This company was great.  They shipped out right away and it came well packgaed.  I can't wait to watch them, I just need a few moments to do it!",1277683200,,144,3.9310344827586206
3758661,5,B001PR2186,I used to watch Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea regularly when I was a kid. This series was not often shown on TV here in France but it was one of my favorite. Actually I think we only had season 2 over here. So I also discovered lots of episodes that I had never seen before. I received the DVDs just a month after ordering which is not too bad for overseas shipping. Picture quality is excellent. Thanks,1258588800,4,405,4.075
3758662,4,B001PR2186,"It's odd that a set like this does not contain the complete series. There are thirteen episodes from season four which have not been released on DVD yet. As far as I can tell, there's nothing new here.

Hopefully we won't have to wait much longer for the rest of the series, but the lag between the release of season three volume two and season four volume one was nearly 18 months.

I also see that MGM is listed as the producer of this set. Fox released the original movie, the TV series, all the DVD's up to this point. So while this doesn't quite make sense, I'll be happy if it gets the rest of the series released.",1247788800,19,620,4.201680672268908

8334445,5,B001PR2186,"My childhood is complete!  I now own ALL The classic Irwin Allen shows on tv back in the day!  The picture quality is great!  But season 4, Vol 2's case was severely cracked across top and other minor cracks elsewhere. The discs were fine and played.  These dvds are all dbl sided.",1445644800,,281,4.346153846153846
8334446,5,B001PR2186,DVD quality is superb.  You even hear sounds and see things not observed or heard on the original television broadcasts.  Certainly increases your viewing pleasure.  Brings back lots of memories.  Great interviews with David Hedison and lots of extras make things really interesting and informative.,1435104000,,299,5.5777777777777775
8334447,1,B001PR2186,Why in the world are they not selling the complete collection together? I guess they get more money selling them separately,1434672000,,123,4.904761904761905

8334451,5,B001PR2186,"The first season had the best stories, the best writers, the best special effects.  The second season some of the writers had left,,,by the third season and the 4th you're at the point of ""Which rubber suited monster is going to attack this week?""",1409356800,,247,4.613636363636363
8334452,5,B001PR2186,"These have been excellent. We have enjoyed them, they remind me of the old series of star trek with the sea monsters and such",1392336000,,125,4.25
8334453,5,B001PR2186,"Loved this show as a kid.  Do note that this is missing the final half season and you'll have to buy it separately but it is available here on amazon as well ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044XV7AQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 ).  The series was a stalwart when I was a child and Admiral Nelson and Captain Crane were my heroes.  It's part cold war suspense and sci-fi fantasy fun rolled into one incredibly well done tv series.  The first season is in B/W but color thereafter and it features great writing with first class acting (essential if you're gonna sell this sort of story to adults too).  Plenty of guest stars too.  If you have fond memories of it from your childhood or just want to introduce it to your progeny you won't be disappointed and if you're a first time viewer rest easy knowing this one holds up all these years later when so many from the same era don't.

Treat yourself!",1391817600,2,902,4.707006369426751
