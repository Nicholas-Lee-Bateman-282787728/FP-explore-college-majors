1625556,4,B00005MFJF,"Somehow I had managed to miss this over the last 50 years. So to see it in 2008, having seen many of the later Carry On films was something of a surprise. The nudge nudge element, I suppose best represented by Sid James, is mostly missing, and the film in black and white still mainly looks as though it was made just after the end of the second world war.

Its humour is more restrained than the later films. In many ways this is a good thing, because when Kenneth Connor and Kenneth Williams do appear the link to the later Carry On films falls into place. The fact that both Connor and Williams are both recruits in the Army tells you all you need to know.

The cast all give fine performances, and its well written and directed. I also wondered whether this was an influence on the writers of the UK TV series Dads Army. Kenneth Connor's character in particular had many of the traits that Corporal Jones would use ten years later. Whilst this may not be as good as Carry on up the Kyber its still a much better film than you might expect.",1208217600,,1043,4.262626262626263
1625557,3,B00005MFJF,"When Carry On Sergeant hit cinemas in 1958 nobody could have predicted how long the series was actually going to run. The very first Carry On film saw Peter Rogers as the producer and Gerald Thomas as the director (together they made all 31 Carry on films). A low budget farce, the film doesn't entireley encapsulate the feel of a typical Carry On film though gave mere hints of what was to come over the next 20 odd years. An army based comedy where strict, no-nonsense drill sergeant, William Hartnell (who was not a bit unlike his ferocious character in real life) attempts to train a bunch of eccentric, accident-prone young men into soldiers fit for fighting the war. Of course when you have the likes of Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey and Kenneth Connor amongst the cast you pretty much can guess what happens. Several slap-stick mishaps raise a chuckle with the flamboyantly camp characterisations of Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey causing the most amusement. The film does hold a surprisingly refreshing sentimental ending which was not untypical of 1950's British comedies. Amongst the rest of the cast is the delightful Hattie Jaques who is given a supporting role, Bob Monkhouse in his first and only Carry On (who also receives top billing), Leslie Phillips and the glamorous Shirley Eaton (a one-time Bond girl) who provides the sexual charisma that would later more famously be provided by Barbara Windsor. An entertaining first entry in the series.
Carry On Nurse saw the series hit the jackpot with this proving an enormous box office suucess in the U.S.A where it ran in some cinemas for an astounding 2 and a half years! Whilst some firmly regard this as one of the best of the entire series, it has to be said that this film has nothing on some of the later medical entries such as Doctor (1967) (even though that was a virtually an updated remake of Nurse), Again Doctor (1969) and Matron (71). The film develops at a leisurley pace and has no real back bone of a plot. Hattie Jaques plays the no-nonsense Matron which would become something of her trademark in the series, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Connor and Leslie Phillips are amongst the patients and Joan Sims makes her debut apperance in a Carry On film (who would stay with the series through to Carry On Emmanuelle in 1978) as a clumsy, accident-prone nurse. A gentle comedy that doesn't quite hit the delights of some of the series future entries but with the vast majority of the regulars being involved its defintley worth a look!",1035936000,17,2538,4.796803652968037
7945468,5,B00005MFJF,"Absolutely hilarious  one of the best of the entire Carry On series. The whole gang is in this one, and you can see where subsequent comedy shows got many of their ideas. You'll like Carry On Teacher too.",1513987200,,204,4.368421052631579
7945469,3,B00005MFJF,"We were expecting this movie plus Carry On Nurse to come on the same disc, but sometimes, strange things happen with orders.  In any case, this was the first film in the Carry On series, 1958.  As to be expected, it was not quite developed, nor was it nearly as polished and smooth as the others that followed.  Interesting therefore to see many of the characters that would become regulars on the wonderful Carry On series.",1497916800,,424,4.552631578947368

7945473,5,B00005MFJF,I preferred Carry on Sargent out of the two but still worth the five stars.,1422489600,,75,4.066666666666666
7945474,5,B00005MFJF,"A classic comedy romp. Featuring a pre Doctor Who performance from William Hartnell as the title character. Sergeant Grimshaw is about to retire from training national service recruits, but he's always hoped he could have a champion platoon before he does. Sadly his final group of recruits appear to be the worst bunch he's ever had! A hypochondriac, a klutz, a snob, a rocker, and a man who was called up on his wedding day and only cares about getting back to his wife to consummate the vows. Can Grimshaw whip this group into shape in time? Or indeed, at all? Playing a hunch he decides to try a different approach. Who knows whether it will work or not?",1416873600,,658,4.53781512605042
7945475,4,B00005MFJF,Saw this in the theater many years ago. It typifies the subtly of British Humor. It's full of giggles. That's why it continues to be offered to the aficionado.,1387065600,,159,4.517241379310345
7945476,5,B00005MFJF,"I had 'an old nurse party' and the star of the show was this old movie.
Who would know about boiling catheters now?
Some of the dialog was difficult to follow due to the English accent but the story was easy to follow.
5 stars for a good afternoon watching.  Jean",1382832000,,263,4.1568627450980395
7945477,5,B00005MFJF,"Carry On Sergeant movie is the one that started it all. Combined with Carry On Nurse, This completes my collection of all the movies in the series. The early British has always been my favorite brand of humor, and I'm glad I purchased this last disc of the series, and it's interesting to see how the series evolved.",1380931200,,316,4.4655172413793105
