8371240,4,B002IW62OG,"Some of these are real gems even though the quality isn't there.  Also on mine it lists Katherine with Sissy Spacek but instead there is BMX Bandits an Australian kids film. It is fun. Made for teens it is a high jinx type movie of 3 friends who are outwitting thieves. Nicole Kidman is about 15 and at the center of the story. I really enjoyed it and will watch it again. Well made.
Many of the other stories are good. I loved the one with Goldie Hawn... Lovers and Liars. Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring with Sally Field is also good. Some of the movies were made for TV Movies All are from the late 60s to the mid 80s.
Transfer quality could be better but a ot of watching for the price.",1519516800,,693,4.095588235294118

First, there are four single-sided DVDs on four spindles in this package. I also saw a similar set that had two double-sided DVDs, but what I bought was this four-DVD set.

Here's what you get, along with some ratings (1-10 scale, updated March 2012) and info from IMDB, an Amazon company:

(4.5) Bail Out, 1989, David Hasselhoff
(6.6) Somewhere, Tomorrow, 1983, Sarah Jessica Parker
(4.0) Cuba Crossing, 1980, Robert Vaughn
(7.3) When the Bough Breaks, 1986, Ted Danson
(6.0) Crossbar, 1989, Kim Cattrall
(5.7) F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles', 1974, Richard Chamberlain
(4.7) Mesmerized, 1986, Jodie Foster
(4.9) Concrete Cowboys, 1979, Tom Selleck
(5.4) Arch of Triumph, 1984, Anthony Hopkins
(6.9) Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring, 1971, Sally Field
(5.0) Lovers and Liars, 1979, Goldie Hawn
(5.6) High Risk, 1981, Anthony Quinn

(6.9) The Deadly Thief (aka Shalimar), 1978, Rex Harrison
(5.9) Five Minutes to Live, 1961, Johnny Cash
(3.2) Laser Mission, 1989, Brandon Lee

As another reviewer mentioned, the box lists Sissy Spacek's ""Katherine,"" but it's replaced on the disc by BMX Bandits.

The two-DVD version that I saw substituted another movie for Laser Mission. You've got to get this one instead; Laser Mission looks like a perfect so-bad-it's-good, MST3K-style movie.",1279324800,25,1634,5.150943396226415
