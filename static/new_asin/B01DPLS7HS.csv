7721428,5,B01DPLS7HS,"This is the only available dvd of the 1972 ""Once Upon A Mattress"". It looks good for its age, but the video transfer cuts off early before the end titles. No way of knowing who the technical people were or the non-starring actors. The production, frankly, looks like an episode from the Carol Burnett Show.  Not a bad thing.  But it would be nice to know who assisted Mary Rodgers with the music and lyrics, the director, lesser known actors, set designer, etc. Otherwise its guaranteed to bring back memories, and it far surpasses the new version in which Burnett plays the queen.",1468281600,2,581,4.631067961165049
7721429,5,B01DPLS7HS,"I bought this disc for Once Upon a Mattress (1972 version).  I remember watching this when it first aired and have been desperate to see it again.  It did not disappoint.  This hilarious musical take on The Princess and the Pea fairy tale was the breakout role for Carol Burnett on Broadway and she gives it her all in this TV version.  For those unfamiliar with the show, its the story about a Prince desperate for a bride, his domineering mother just as desperate that her little darling never find one, his mute father who will only find his voice when the mouse devours the hawk, and a kingdom where no one can marry until the Prince does.  Into this mix arrives Princess Winnifred the Woebegone (aka: Fred) who is so eager to meet the prince that she swims the mote.  Let the courtship begin!  Several songs from the Broadway version were trimmed or eliminated for time, and the production is very stagey, but well worth your time for the sheer joy of it all.
Sadly, the 1964 TV version with the original Broadway case is apparently lost forever, but three of the original cast are back for this version  Burnett, Jack Gilford and Jane White.  However, on the plus side, the 1972 cast includes Bernadette Peters, Ken Berry and Wally Cox.
Time Life did a fine job of restoring Once Upon a Mattress, even including the original commercials (but oddly there are also two extended blackout moments, probably for station identification).
The other two programs included on the disc are the 1966 CBS special ""Carol +2"" (featuring Lucille Ball and Zero Mostel), and I believe the first appearance of Burnetts trademark charwoman.  Since other reviewers have described these two shows in detail already, I won't repeat them, except to say that Carol Burnett taped short introductions to all three programs included on this disc.
Fans of musical theater, this is a must have!  I am thrilled to be able to add this to my DVD library, and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1467072000,13,1967,4.639769452449568

7721431,4,B01DPLS7HS,"Carol + 2: The Original Queens of Comedy features the TV special Carol + 2, which aired on March 22, 1966. CBS promised Carol Burnett her own special if she could deliver a major star. She asked Lucille Ball, who was one of her greatest influences, and Lucy agreed.

The resulting hour-long special also featured Zero Mostel, and contained bits that would foreshadow elements of The Carol Burnett Show, which premiered the following fall: Carols familiar earlobe tug, comic sketches, special musical numbers, and a slam-bang finale. Highlights include Carol and Zero in a wedding anniversary sketch of considerable marital angst, Carol and Lucy cavorting in a variation of Carols Charwoman character, and Carol and Lucy performing the rousing Chutzpah. This was the second TV appearance of the Charwoman, which became a staple of the series and was used in the shows animated opening credits.

Also on this DVD release is the 1972 color TV movie of Once Upon a Mattress, starring Carol as Princess Winifred, with Ken Berry, Jane White, Bernadette Peters, and Jack Gilford. In addition, Carol discusses the origins of the Charwoman and introduces the very first appearance of this character in the television special Carol and Company, originally aired on February 24, 1963.",1463270400,9,1273,5.144927536231884

8756602,2,B01DPLS7HS,"Very disappointed in the quality and structure of this DVD.  It is not presented as the very limited description reveals it to be.  You have to manually start the DVD in different sections where it just stops and this 'feature' was not described, there are actually TV product commercials shown which is NOT described and there is more narration than there are comedy sketches.  Both Lucy and Carol were great comedians in the own right and this DVD should have been put together much better than it is.  I would not buy it again nor recommend it.",1493683200,,547,4.608247422680412
