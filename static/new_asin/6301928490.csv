378118,3,6301928490,"Reasonably entertaining 1974 made-for-TV period flick has a decent pedigree-- written by John Milius ('Dillinger,' 'Red Dawn') and directed by Dan Curtis (TV's 'Dark Shadows,' 'The Winds of War')-- but manages to rise only a notch or two above average for fare of this type.  The story, based in part on real events, centers on legendary FBI agent Purvis as he tracks down notorious gangster George Barnes, a.k.a. 'Machine Gun Kelly,' and his entourage following their kidnapping-for-ransom of wealthy Oklahoma resident Charles Urschel (here renamed Thatcher Covington) in the early 1930s.  With the assistance of a good cast (many familiar character actors from film and television), the overall effect is not dissimilar from Arthur Penn's revisionist 'Bonnie and Clyde' or Milius's own 'Dillinger,' sanitized for the public airwaves.  3 stars (3-plus if you like your car chases accompanied by jaw harp).",1336435200,5,906,5.411347517730497

378184,4,6301928490,The real story of Melvin Purvis is pretty interesting and deserves better treatment than this B grade short story.

Melvin Purvis (CLIFF ROBERTSON) as G man (government agent) who is after the Machine Gun Kelly Gang. This opens as the Kelly Gang bicker among themselves after a botched bank robbery. Half the GANG are bumped off ....including DAVID CANARY (ALL MY CHILDREN) They end up kidnapping a very wealthy man (DICK SERGENT) for the easy money ransom. the G men close in to the ""hide out"" where a dawn raid kills some of the gang. BEST shot in the movie is Elliot STREET whining his way down a stair way ....to surrender to the FBI.....Shot by Dan Curtis (DARK SHADOWS and Winds  of WAR)....a few good car chases. mostly a real yawner.....3 STARS~",1455753600,2,708,4.701612903225806

A car drives then stops by a bank, men get out. But the bank has gone bust! The third one dry bank this month. Masked armed men enter a hotels kitchen, then the main ball room and abduct one man. But a car won't start! They acquire another. Melvin Purvis arrives to personally handle this kidnapping case. The Kelly Gang hides out at an old farm in Indiana, then splits up. They drive to a small town to meet Buckwheats family. They want $500,000 ransom! The Hamm kidnapping got only $200,000. Purvis wants this paid as bait (the money is marked, serial numbers recorded).

FBI agents investigate the pick-up place, a hamburger joint. The release victim is questioned by the Press, he was blindfolded and knows nothing. The Press reports upsets the two gangs in Oklahoma, they leave for Arkansas. Robbing a gas station creates a mess. Mr. Covington visits Melvin Purvis to make a deal; he wants to go along on the hunt. They agree. The police see that distinctive Rolls-Royce and chase the crooks until they hit a roadblock! The Kelly Gang wants to go to Memphis to change the marked ransom money for clean money (laundering). Purvis and the FBI get closer, Covington identifies the locale.

They strike in the morning so none can get away. That house is surrounded. The local boys are given the task of blocking the back road. The gang is awakened by a car horn, then the shooting begins. Men fall. George and his wife run out the back way to a hidden car. Wait for me, Georgy! They escape! One gang member is left and is asked to surrender; he does and talks. Purvis and the FBI arrive at the Monarch Hotel in Memphis to find Kelly on the sixth floor. Kelly surrenders to the G-Men. There is a scene between Covington and Kellys wife. [Does it add to the story?] Maybe you don't know these people as well as you thought you did. Purvis gets a shoeshine to celebrate, and smokes another cigar.

This is a sequel to the earlier Dillinger movie from the year before. The actor playing Purvis seems better. [Or is it the scriptwriter?] The banjo playing seems to imitate the earlier and more  successful Bonnie and Clyde (which was criticized for painting a pretty picture of a pair of robbers and killers). In the olden days robbing a bank created financial distress for the local area. The history of Melvin Purvis is interesting. After leaving the FBI he created the Junior G-Men for a breakfast cereal company, but had an unhappy future. If you like to see a recreation of life in the 1930s this is worth watching. The Grapes of Wrath is more realistic though.",1445126400,2,2594,4.56989247311828

I only know what I like, so I gave it a 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and my short time with Dale Robertson.",1438214400,3,390,4.038961038961039
