2359580,5,B000A59Q0U,"Got my copy in HMV Japan last August and although I paid quite a fortune for the DVDs, every penny is worth it. There is nothing but pure good music from the maestro Chick Corea and friends. A well worth investment if I musy say., after all this event is only once in a lifetime and  thank you Chick for sharing your beautiful music with us.",1123804800,2,341,4.166666666666667
2359581,5,B000A59Q0U,"This is the best concert DVD that has been produced to this time.  Chick is at the top of his game, the musicians are the state of the art in jazz and the production values are first rate.  I know this because I have seen all of the perfomances on the BET jazz channel.  This is truly a gift.",1121299200,4,292,3.9152542372881354
8074453,5,B000A59Q0U,A wonderful set.,1417737600,,16,4.666666666666667
8074454,3,B000A59Q0U,"I had really high hopes for this set, as I'm not only a huge fan of Chick Corea, but also of many of the guests artists on the DVDs.  Unfortunately, however, many of the DVDs come off as if Chick said ""hey you, join me on stage and we'll jam for an hour and see what happens"".  Chick's playing is of course virtuosic, but so many of the tunes come off sounding unrehearsed.  If the Origin and Three Quartets Band DVDs were sold separately I'd suggest just buying those two, but unfortunately, they're not.",1382572800,,505,4.351063829787234
8074455,5,B000A59Q0U,"Absolutely worth having. Lots of classic music here. The Three Quartets band was amazing & the footage of Michael Brecker is priceless as this was taped not too long before the onset of his illness. Add the other greats Gary Burton, Miroslav Vitous & all the other musicians & you have a winner here. Although you will notice Chick looks much better weightwise these days as opposed to when this set was taped. Hope the 70th birthday set of concerts was taped as well.",1356825600,,468,4.583333333333333
8074456,5,B000A59Q0U,"Chick Corea's Rendezvous in New York is a collection of 10 DVD's from a series of concerts at the Blue Note in New York City to celebrate Chick's 60th birthday.  Disc 1 pairs Chick and Bobby McFerrin, whose voice can only be labeled as astoundingly ""instrumental.""  Disc 2 brings together Chick with Roy Haynes on drums and Miroslav Vitous on bass.  Disc 3 - Remembering the Bud Powell Band brings together Chick, Roy Haynes, Christian McBride (bass) Joshua Redman (sax) and Terence Blanchard (trumpet).  Disc 4 is the superb duo of Chick and Gary Burton on vibes.  This is perhaps my personal favorite of the entire set of discs.  Disc 5 is the Chick Corea Akkoustic  Band with Chick, John Patitucci on bass and Dave Weckl on drums.  Disc 6 is Chick & Origin - which pairs Chick with Avishai Cohen (bass) Jeff Ballard (drums) Steve Wilson (alto sax) Steve Davis (trombone) and Tim Garland (tenor sax).Disc 7 is the piano duo of Chick and Gonzalo Rubalcaba.  Disc 8 is the Chick Corea New Trio of Chick, Avishai Cohen (bass) and Jeff Ballard (drums).  Disc 9 is the Three Quartets Band comprised of Chick, Michael Brecker (tenor sax), Eddie Gomez (bass) and Steve Gadd (drums).  Disc 10 is a bonus disc - the movie of Rendezvous in New York.

I had looked whistfully at this set of discs for quite a long time and when it came up on sale at Amazon recently, jumped on the chance to acquire it for my collection!  It is highly recommended for fans of Chick Corea.  The videography and sound quality of the DVDs is excellent.  Since I've been sitting here writing this review, I think I'll sit down and watch a few of t he discs over again this afternoon as an alternative to Sunday football.  Living close to NYC, I get the Giants and Jets whether I want to watch them or not, and having grown up in Pittsburgh, I'll leave it to the reader's imagination who I'd prefer to watch on the football field, and they've not had a stellar year!",1356220800,,1935,4.485714285714286
8074457,5,B000A59Q0U,"Chick Corea never panders to the tastes of those who merely want more of the same, his is mainstream jazz with a twist and music that ventures into the unknown without ever getting the listeners lost. You can feel the sense of purpose as every one of the musicians called upon is treated with great respect, allowed enough space to make a full statement, and as Chick adds a few punctuating elements or sits in listening intently, you can enjoy the sheer diversity of his musical universe. His own improvisations can be terse, playful, meditative, but always rhythmically stimulating and melodically surprising, while constantly expanding the harmonic grid, much to everyone's enjoyment. At 60, he never sounds nostalgic. Rather, he is a guide who will invite you to discover how rich his inner world may be, without resorting to easy tricks, like getting the audience to stomp their feet or sing along, and I suspect his ultimate goal is to take you on a roller-coaster ride just to teach you not to take his music for granted. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",1257897600,,1065,4.857142857142857
8074458,2,B000A59Q0U,"The packaging is horrible.  One of the DVD holders was smashed and had caused damage to one of the best DVD's.  Unacceptable.
The performances are great if you are a Chick fan.  If you are just a casual listener don't buy this.  You'll probably get bored.",1233792000,,255,4.478260869565218
8074459,5,B000A59Q0U,"I mostly agree with the previously mentioned details - but now that the price has dropped, I had to comment. Ten dvds of live jazz featuring Chick and various groups - recorded live, with good sound and close to HD widescreen video is a great change! (especially for those who, like me, usually watch old B&W Miles and Trane videos...) all for $40 - Four bucks per dvd? You've got to be kidding - this is a must-have! Even if you (like me) aren't excited about every single concert, and, well, Roy Haynes is a bit low in the mix for my taste, grab this deal while you can. Got to be 5 stars.",1229126400,,591,4.192982456140351
8074460,5,B000A59Q0U,This is by far the best video compilation of Chick Corea performing with his various groups. The music is inspirational and all of the musicians are world class and deliver excellent performances. A must for any Chick Corea fan.,1152316800,3,228,4.871794871794871
8074461,5,B000A59Q0U,"I agree with the other reviewers.  This is an amazing collection of outstanding acoustic jazz performances.  The video is high-def, and the sound is audiophile quality.

At $90, this is a major investment.  To be safe, you might consider first buying the 2-CD sampler, which contains 1 or 2 tracks from each of the 8 or 9 bands that participated in this event.  Amazon.com sells this 2-CD sampler.

Before ordering either item, though, visit Chick's website (chickcorea.com), which has copies of both autographed by Chick himself, for about the same price as Amazon.

In any case, this set is an incredible value - $90 for 10 DVDs, 9 of which are a full concert by a top acoustic jazz combo, each featuring one of the best 2 or 3 jazz pianists of all time.",1130457600,21,756,4.597014925373134
8074462,5,B000A59Q0U,"This DVD just arrived today 10/6/2005. I had to watch a good many of the DVDS. It's a true classic Jazz mish mash of Chick's Piano adventures. You won't find any Fusion here really, it's all beautiful soulful Jazz. I have to say at first I was a bit disappointed by the fact that his fusion work had been ommited, from this collection no Return to Forever or some  of the more progressive Fusion I have known him for. No keyboard other than sweet piano. After listening and watching a few of these DVD's it all became quite clear to me, the mood of dusky, dim lit bar aura that embraces old style Jazz with class. I came to embrace the pure feeling of clean music with no  tricks, I  knew what it was all about suddenly. This is a purest collecton of Jazz untainted by the throws of Rock and Roll. Go down down that road with Chick and his friends, its sofisticated clean lines wash over your soul. If you love Jazz, you will love this 10 DVD set, it covers every ERA of chick's long and storied career in JAZZ. Don't get me wrong it does not cover his whole career, but the Jazz portion of it fully. The quality of this DVD is top notch, audio is digital streamed, video is filmed in full HD.

You won't find a finer all around collection of pure Jazz classics done by a better group of musician's.",1128556800,10,1299,4.225806451612903
