854625,5,630430420X,"With the 10th Doctor's reunion with companion Sarah Jane Smith and K-9 in 2006's ""SCHOOL REUNION"" Releasing Sarah's final adventure with the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker) as 1976's Hand of Fear ends with a touching and surprisingly warm departure as the Doctor and Sarah part company. It's no accident that the new series sought out her return, SJS, the plucky journalist portrayed by Elisabeth Sladen is one of the best-loved companions, leastwise before ROSE TYLER's appearance. First appearing as a women's libber in the 3rd Doctor's Time Warrior, in which she mistakes him for a malevolent traitor. SJS was introduced as a strong character that wasn't going to need the Doctor's rescuing, much like Rose, although invariably evolving into a character that needed the Doctor's rescuing anyway. Sarah's met the first 5 Doctor's in ""The 5 Doctors,"" she's had a X-mas special with K-9 ( a Christmas present from the Doctor, K-9 & Company) and word is that a children's spin-off is now in the works for the pair.

After the Doctor and Sarah Jane mistakenly land in a present-day (70's) quarry (an amusing location considering all the quarry filled alien worlds presented over the years) and the pair are caught up in an explosion.  Sarah is rushed to hospital, clutching a stone hand . But when the hand possesses Sarah's mind, a chain reaction begins, resulting in a confrontation on the frozen planet of Kastria.

This story arc is typical of Tom Baker's Doctor, the affection that the Doctor and Sarah have for one another really bring together the episode. Both over the top portrayals of the power-hungry and paranoid Eldrad are very memorable as are the mind-zapped catch-phrase ""Eldrad must live!""

854626,4,630430420X,"In Sarah Jane Smith's last adventure with the Doctor, she goes through a bit in the first two episodes.  One, she is buried under a pile of rubble, when she and the Doctor accidentally stray near a quarry that is been dynamited.  Two, she is possessed by a strange fossilized hand that is uncovered during said blasting that leads her to say ""Eldrad must live.""  Three, she has lots of fun going around firing a blue light from a ring at anyone who tells her to stop.  And four, are you ready for this... she locks herself and the hand in the outer chamber of the radioactive core at the Nunton Power Complex.  I've heard of A Boy And His Dog, but A Girl And Her Hand?  Hmm...  But as Liz Sladen (Sarah) was with the series for three seasons, script-editor Robert Holmes thus made that part of the story central to Sarah.
The Doctor hypothesizes that the hand, originating from a silicon-based lifeform, is alive and is using radiation to regenerate itself.  That does explain why Sarah comes out of the radiation chamber alive and well despite being exposed to enough radiation to kill a school of whales.  But who or what is Eldrad?
There is a scene when the director of Nunton, Professor Watson, phones his wife and tells her in a calm voice that he may be delayed.  He lies that there is nothing wrong and to kiss the children for him.  This is when it looks like the facility might undergo meltdown.  At the end of the call, his expression is one having resigned to the fact that he might well die before the day is over.  This is Glyn Houston's best part in his role as Watson.
The crystalline costume for Eldrad is quite a beaut, which is clearly a blue-gray body suit with crystals and metal pieces attached to resemble a clump of jewels at various points.  Judith Paris's portrayal of Eldrad retains the alien nature of this being, down to the voice.  As Eldrad has been an alien exiled from Kastria and sentenced to obliteration, something that didn't succeed, the obsession of paranoia, in not trusting people, is well-acted.  And the sight of a hand moving by itself isn't something one sees everyday.  As Sarah says, ""Careful, that's not as 'armless as it looks.""  Harmless, armless,... right.
The one thing that may throw fans is the farewell between the Doctor and one of his longest traveling companions.  In contrast to the Third Doctor being shattered when Jo leaves him, here, the Fourth Doctor's not too emotional goodbye is a bit questionable.  Then again, Tom Baker and Liz Sladen reworked that part of the dialogue themselves, so who knows?
The scenes in the nuclear plant, mainly episodes 2 and 3, are the bright points of The Hand Of Fear, as it's fast-moving and tense.  Indeed, location filming was done at the Oldbury Nuclear Power Station in Avon, where the people there were enthusiastic in helping out the production team.  Things slow down in the last episode, but it's an all right story.",1077926400,23,2921,4.598455598455598
854627,4,630430420X,"Bob Baker and Dave Martin seemed to have a knack for embedding catchphrases into the minds of their viewers: these are the same guys that gave us ""Contact Has Been Made"" (The Invisible Enemy), and ""The Quest is The Quest"" (Underworld).  Here the catchphrase is the simple imperative: ""Eldrad Must Live.""  By the end of chapter two, this mantra has been repeated at least once by every principal cast member, building up to the moment when we finally get a look at this Eldrad character -and SHE is not at all what we expected!
The episode kicks off by making fun of the series itself: the TARDIS materializes in what looks like yet another rock quarry  --Sarah immediately concludes that they have once again gone astray and landed on some remote alien planet.  The joke is, of course, that they have in fact arrived in present-day England...in an actual rock quarry!
The first half of the story plays out in the present day, with the Doctor interacting with ordinary everyday characters in a hospital, a pathology lab, and a nuclear reactor complex  --certainly no clue is given as to the long-ago and far-distant goings-on of the planet Kastria and the fate of its people.  Eldrad goes from being a fright element that possesses people (in two cases, to their deaths), to an actual multifaceted  --even passionate-- character who elicits some audience sympathy, then finally into a stomping, shouting, villain who only dreams of conquest  --the sort of shallow character with which Sarah and the Doctor are altogether too familiar, thank you.  Perhaps the Kastrians knew something about themselves and their nature that Eldrad was never willing to accept?
Of course this episode is critical to the overall Doctor Who story arc because it features Sarah Jane's departure; hands-down she is the most popular traveling companion in the series' history to date, and rumors of her exit actually make a few headlines and the evening news.  Sarah certainly gets put through the ringer in her swansong: she is nearly crushed to death in a rockfall, she is possessed by an alien intelligence and nearly triggers a nuclear reactor meltdown; she is shot at, dodges alien traps and pitfalls with alarming regularity, and even must endure the indignity of being ""re-hypnotized"" by the Doctor all over again.  It is little wonder that after departing Kastria, she snaps and launches into a long-overdue angry tirade.  Actress Elizabeth Sladen improvises this ""rant"" with such petulance that the audience is clucking in total sympathy by the time she storms out.  Not one of the greatest Dr. Who episodes of all time, but definitely one of the best of the Tom Baker era.",1051747200,10,2657,4.917225950782997
854628,4,630430420X,"This story begins with a death sentence to be carried out on an alien found guilty of a most treacherous act which is not carried out exactly according to plan.
Switch to the quarry, a bit of an in-joke after all of the Pertwee years where the quarry seemed to become an almost required set. It is ironic too that the alien story element is actually a silicon based lifeform!
In the last Sarah Jane Smith story, I believe that she was the longest serving of the Doctor's companions, the story involves regeneration of an alien life-form through the consumption of radiation from a nuclear power station despite military intervention which, as always, is ineffective. The story is reminiscent of the old horror movie of the hand which has a life of it's own but in a different way. The alien life form when recreated has a strange beauty and a believable tale to tell convincing the Doctor to return it to it's own planet.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, the usual story of treachery and deceit is relived again with an interesting transformation of form once again and a twist in the tale.
This story is not apparently as dark a tale as the others under Philip Hinchcliffe's excellent production. On closer inspection however, this is a story of genocide, but it is not really explored sufficiently. It is also like the Egyptian theme of 'Pyramids of Mars' and the story of Horus and Osiris. A stunning contrast to the 'Masque of Mandragora' which precedded it and to the 'Deadly Assassin' which followed it, this is certainly an interesting story.
Just one thing, it always irritated me about Elisabeth Sladen wearing those Andy Pandy overall things.",1020556800,,1649,4.729166666666667
854629,3,630430420X,"Although certainly not dealing with unusual subject matter, the structure of this story is a bit odd for Doctor Who. The better part of the first three episodes happen on Earth, where Sarah Jane is accidentally hypnotized and converted into the servant of Eldrad, a long-dead alien ruler, by the fossilized remains of Eldrad's hand. Eldrad itself is reborn about halfway through the story, and becomes a ""good guy"" (well, sort of), enlisting the Doctor and Sarah to take it back to its home planet. From there, the last episode-and-then-some takes place on the alien planet of Kastria.
Because of the major change in plot and location, the story feels somewhat disjointed or slow in places. One odd point is that although a lot of the Earth plot involves Eldrad sending a nuclear plant critical, UNIT is never called in to do anything (that seems like their usual cup of tea). Despite a bit of plodding, the adventure is overall pretty good, with some very fun bits. Tom Baker is a bit more subdued than usual, but Lis Sladen really shines in her final adventure as Sarah Jane - her ""hypnotised"" performance is really nicely done without being too over-the-top, and worth the price of admission alone. The costume design for Eldrad is quite nice, and the actress who plays Eldrad's female form does quite well. Of particular note is a touching and very sad departure scene for Sarah, in which she is forced to leave the Doctor for her old life in England.
Not the very best of the Whos, but quite serviceable, and definitely worth seeing if you like Sarah Jane.",996105600,2,1561,4.721611721611722
854630,4,630430420X,"""The Hand of Fear"" is a very unusual story. It is definitely not the best Doctor Who story made, and it is hardly what fandom calls a ""classic"". But there is something about it that makes it different from your run of the mill alien invasion story. Firstly it is very well written and acted, but the best thing about it is the way the story is played out. All through the first two episodes the viewer never expects where the story is going or what will happen next. This is especially poignant because in the last two episodes the story shifts dramatically. The first half focuses on the hand and its possession of Sarah and is more action oriented, while the second half centres on Eldrad (only hinted at in episodes one and two), with less action, more character development and further steps into the unknown (especially after arriving on Kastria). This factor of the unexpected is probably what makes ""The Hand of Fear"" so satisfying. Eldrad is a fascinating character - especially being one who changes sex! Judith Paris's performance is exceptional, portraying a guarded yet determined being. She can never be trusted, but her motives always remain unclear. Stephen Thorne's performance as the male Eldrad is probably less satisfying (like Brian Blessed, he is a shouting actor!), but his method is more appropriate to the new side the character shows, a revelation of his true colours now he is on home turf. The costumes for both the female and male Eldrads are brilliant as well. The usual ""Earth in danger"" storyline that prevailed through this era of Doctor Who is also presented with a different slant - for most of the story the Earth is not presented as being under threat of conquest or destruction - not until the last five minutes. This notion of no threat to the Earth until the end is a satisfying alternative to the sci-fi cliche. There are other small touches that make ""The Hand of Fear"" a worthwhile story - for once a quarry in England IS a quarry in England and not an alien landscape! The hand coming to life at the end of episode one is spine-tingling and amazing (another great cliffhanger); its spider-like movements are creepy. There is a touching moment when Professor Watson talks to his wife on the phone, believing he will soon be dead and wanting to say some last words - thought is given to the embodiment of the supporting characters. There is, however, a problem with Watson's character in episode three, when he calls in the RAF to bomb the nuclear reactor - an idiotic move, especially coming from a nuclear scientist! The story ends with the farewell of Sarah Jane, a favourite companion of many fans. Her sending off is touching, dignified and quite sad. ""The Hand of Fear"" should have three stars; however, the ""something"" that makes it better than it should be (which I have hopefully tried to explain and justify in this review), makes it a four star story.",973036800,7,2903,4.694117647058824
854631,5,630430420X,"This was the first episode of the series that I ever had the pleasure to see as a pre-teenager and some 15 years later I'm still a devoted fan - if that isn't a testimony to the greatness of this story, I don't know what  is! Elisabeth Sladen is in top form and the chemistry between the Doctor  and Sarah is the best in the series' history. It makes her final departure  all the more powerful. The final scene with Sarah alone on the street is  eerie, sad, and strangely hopeful.  Ironically, you feel the dawning of a  new era happening as the frame freezes Sarah Jane in time and space. It  filled me with the desire to immediately see MORE MORE MORE!",952041600,5,654,4.2682926829268295

854726,5,630430420X,"A superb example of Tom Baker's version of the Doctor, ""The Hand of Fear"" has it all:  earth-bound adventure, inter-planetary drama, and a story literally spanning millions of years. The costuming for Eldrad (female figure and final alien form) is extremely well-done; the character truly looked like living crystal. Additionally, the final scene (SPOILER ALERT) wherein Sarah Jane leaves the Doctor is played with barely restrained emotion.  A viewer can sense that both character's were deeply saddened by the change, but went along with it anyway.  (I've always been especially fond of both the regeneration stories and those in which a companion departs.) Any Baker fan should have ""The Hand of Fear."" (Suggestion watch ""Hand"" followed by the David Tennant episode which brings back Sarah Jane.)",1409011200,,799,5.325396825396825
854727,4,630430420X,"While this isn't one of the Best Doctor Who stories, it is certainly an entertaining and solidly produced story. It never feels padded and it has a nice selection of settings (although the nuclear power plant from late one to mid-part three is the most memorable location.) The idea of a hand that moves on its own is creepy and done to decent effect.

However, it's the acting that really holds this together . Elizabeth Sladen has some great moments in her last regular outing as Sarah Jane Smith and Tom Baker is in top form. The supporting cast also turned in some stand out performances. Glyn Houston took what would usually be throw away role as a bureaucrat in charge of a nuclear power plant and instead created a character viewers cared about. Judith Paris was superb as the first version of Eldrad.

The farewell scene between the Doctor and Sarah Jane was very classy and understated with some very nice subtle emotional touches that don't go to excess.

The serial's weak point was its resolution of the Eldrad plot which wasn't very satisfying. Still, the journey was fun, and is  a great serial to watch for fans of Sarah Jane Smith.",1407801600,,1147,4.635467980295567

'The Hand of Fear' is the second story of the magnificent fourteenth season in the classic series of Doctor Who. It is very notable in that it is the story where Sarah-Jane Smith leaves the TARDIS in a beautifully written scene. Overall, the story is really, really good, but it does have some flaws. The structure and pacing are very repetitive, and Stephen Thorne's portrayal as Eldrad isn't too great. But the script is really good, and the performances are top-notch, specifically Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen. Their chemistry is just phenomenal.

While all this is happening it watches a ship that is set to detonate with there greatest villan on board. But since the world they live on is turning to ice and those on the surface will die he has to detonate so the ship destroy and see Eldrad die. But before detonation can happen the computers begin to freeze and they must exicute him now. With a small percentage that Eldrad will surivie they must take that risk.
  The TARDIS lands in of all places a rock quarry. What neither of them know is that a crew has set chanrges to blow for more rock.  As they set the charge and primmed it to explode they notice and try to warn them. The Doctor manages to escape but Sarah is caught in the blast and is buried underneath rubble. The Doctor along with the demoltion crew are trying to unbury Sarah.  Meanwhile Sarah has awoken and grabs for the first thing she dsicovers a stone hand.  She nearly passes out once touching it and the scream lets the Doctor know where she is.
  Sarah taken to a nearby hospital the Doctor is trying to figure out why she won't let go of the hand.  The doctors at the hospital pried the stone hand from her and have begun to treat her.  The Doctor takes the hand to a nearby science research facility to study the hand. What the research on hand notes is the hand doesn't conform to any known rock sample. Strange still the nucelar powered device power has been abosred and the hand crystaline structure has changed since first looking at it.  The Doctor in convinced that the stone has something to do with the state of Sarah and not the explosion.  Racing back to the hopsital he tries to get to her, but discovers he's too late. Sarah has escaped and is searching for the hand.  The researcher who was helping the Doctor is assaulted by her with the powers of the hand and retakes it.  Once the hand is hers she makes way to a nearby nucelar powerplant.  There she breaks in and heads to the core of the plant.  There she places it near the center and watches as the finger regenrates and the hand begins to move.
  The Doctor and the researcher makes way to the plant to find Sarah and save her.  The plant cheif of operation has evacuated the facility and called for an air striek realzing that the only way to stop whatever is growing in the core can be stopped.  The Doctor tries in vain to stop the strike and is forced out of the plant and watches in horror as the stirke happens and watches as the power of the force implodes and the faicilty is safe. Without waiting he dashes back in and finds Sarah unhamred and watches as from the core door an alien made of crystal and rock called Eldrad.  Eldrad is confused and siroiented as to how long it has been asleep and realizes it is not on its homeworld.  The Doctor tell Eldrad that he will take it home but only to its present time and Eldrad agrees.  The Doctor begins to suspect that Eldrad is not telling him the truth and thinks Eldrad maybe the real monster here.  Can the Doctor figure out what Eldrad is after on his homeworld?

854806,4,630430420X,"""The Hand of Fear"" marked Elisabeth Sladen's last story as one of the most memorable companions the Doctor ever had, Sarah Jane Smith. And it's one of Sladen's best performances, showing the broad range she brought to the role, the very qualities that induced producer Barry Letts to cast her in the first place.

The storyline is a fairly simple one: Sarah  and the Doctor materialize in a quarry moments before a mining explosion buries her in rubble but exposes a mysterious fossil of a hand dating back 150 million years. Sarah Jane is rescued but soon possessed by psychic energy emanating from the hand, which insists ""Eldrad must live!"" and compels her to take it to a nearby nuclear power station, where exposure to radiation will bring it to life and allow it to regenerate to a full silicon lifeform.

Sladen's cold stare as she falls under the sway of Eldrad is particularly eerie, and Judith Paris as Eldrad in feminine form is one of the most attractive as well as fascinating aliens the show ever conceived. Silicon-based life was still a fairly new concept to most science-fiction viewers at the time. Location shooting was done inside an actual nuclear plant in Oldbury, greatly broadening the scope of the action and giving the show a gleaming, authentic look.

The Special Features menu includes an above-average 50-minute documentary recounting Tom Baker's and Elisabeth Sladen's tenures on the show, which was attracting a whopping 10 million to 12 million viewers a week during this period. That was 20 percent of the U.K.'s population at the time, the equivalent of 60 million viewers in the U.S. today.",1312243200,,1625,4.898181818181818

When she is found, she is unconscious and clinging to a hand-shaped rock. On the rock is a ring that seems to take control of Sarah. As the Doctor investigates, he discovers that the hand came from a living entity which is now in control of his companion.

854810,4,630430420X,"Rather than dwell on the specifics of the episode, which is a solid mid-tenure Tom Baker episode, but nothing more, I want to point out the excellence of the bonus material.
Not all DVDs feature Tom Baker on commentary or in interview form, but here we have both. The in-depth documentary on the making of the episode provides lengthy interview material with Liz Sladen and Tom Baker that extend beyond simply commenting on this episode. Indeed, they both recount how they came about to be chosen for their roles.
The real gem is the short (11 minute) video from a British children's tv show, which features Tom and Liz back then. This is priceless.

Also it is great episode to introduce Doctor Who to a person who has never seen it before or who has never seen the classic series (as apposed to the new series which started in 2005).

I think it has all the elements that make ""Doctor Who"" what it is.  A funky and creative alien monster; a trip in the Tardis, the Doctor's time-space machine; a suspenseful situation; and it depicts a caring relationship between the Doctor has his traveling companion Sarah Jane Smith, in her last episode as a regular.

The DVD also has great commentary from Tom Baker and other actors appearing in the episode.",1209859200,,713,4.546875
854876,5,630430420X,"Despite being a solid serial, ""The Hand of Fear"" is probably best remembered for being Elisabeth Sladen's exit from ""Doctor Who.""  The story begins with the early obliteration of a criminal and then hurls the viewer into a modern day quarry where we find the Doctor (Tom Baker) and Sarah Jane (Sladen) in the middle of a blast at the quarry.  Once they are rescued, a hand that Sarah Jane has discovered overtakes her and leads her to a nearby nuclear plant in order to, as the Doctor later explains, regenerate itself.  After a failed attempt with the Doctor's companion, the hand takes successfully takes control of a plant employee and takes on a female form of the being known as Eldrad.  The being, played by Judith Paris in a costume that resembles Rebecca Romjin's Mystique from the ""X-men"" films, has plans to return to its home planet of Kastria in order to reclaim its rightful power.  The Doctor agrees to help Eldrad return home, but what is Eldrad really up to?

The cast is very solid.  Paris works wonders as the female form of Eldrad.  She captivates the audience in each scene.  Glyn Houston portrays Watson, who heads up the nuclear plant and he does a fine job.  Rex Robinson portrays Dr. Carter, an unfortunate acquaintance of Sarah Jane while she's under the control of Eldrad's hand.  Tom Baker, arguably the most popular Doctor, is in top form, trading quips with Elisabeth Sladen and bumbling his way through all of the chaotic events that are going on.  Sladen does very well also.

When the story is resolved, Sladen makes a somewhat anti-climactic exit.  It works even though it lacks much of the chemistry that she and Baker possessed.  She would return in later serials as a guest star including reprising her role in the new series alongside David Tennant as Doctor #10, as well as appear in ""K9 & Company"" and a brand new series aptly titled ""The Sarah Jane Adventures.""  Few companions throughout Who history grabbed the attention and the hearts as Sarah Jane did.  In fact, I'd say that only Rose from the revived series comes close.

The DVD is excellent.  It comes with all of the regulars established by the Doctor Who DVD releases from the BBC, as well as an engaging ""Changing Time"" documentary about the serial and the development of Sarah Jane and Doctor #4.  Perhaps the best feature that I found was the ""Swap Shop"" segment wherein we get to see Sladen and Baker interact with youngsters via telephone.  It proves just how much of the fourth Doctor really is Tom Baker in real life.

An excellent serial, a decent send-off for Sarah Jane and some very good special features make this a good investment for any Who fan.  I highly recommend it.",1209513600,3,2684,4.663829787234042

It is wonderful to see this story without the snow or streaks that I was used to seeing when watching it on a PBS station on a UHF channel many miles away! The acting was good, the characters interesting and the effects where not to bad. I love the interviews and behind the show stories.

My only issue, as with all of the DVD's is that you can't watch the whole story (like you could on PBS) without the half hour segments being broken up by credits.

You will enjoy the fourth Doctor and Sarah (her last show :-( ) as they face danger with another ruthless enemy!",1198886400,2,663,4.131782945736434
854879,3,630430420X,"Not bad quite enjoyable but falls far short of being exceptional. I'm going to tell you how I came to this conclusion but first a quick plot overview.

  The Tardis lands in a quarry the Doctor and Sarah realise to late that an excavation explosion is about to take place. Sarah is burried in rock when she's dug out she found gripping a mysterious stone hand with a stange ring. She's taken to the hospital unconscious,but soon is awake in a trance like state zapping all who would stop her with the ring, saying, ""Eldrad must live."",while carrying the strange hand with her in a Tupperware container.

 The Doctor soon realizes she's headed to the local nuclear power station for the hand feeds off radiation. The Doctor must avert total disaster and
save Sarah from the hand's influence and discover the truth about Eldrad before it's too late!

  The reason I only gave this three stars is simple. I believe science-fiction lives and dies under repeat viewings. I bought this used on VHS from Amazon about three years`ago. I watched it a couple of times and then didn't touch it again. When this came out on DVD I bought it and when I watched it for the first time I thought why haven't I watched this more recently this is fantastic. But on repeated views I realized why I had let it lay dorment so long.

 The simple fact of the matter is it gets weaker with repeated viewings. Some Doctor Who's get stronger with repeate viewings because you see new things you notice bits of dialogue you haven't noticed before see small plot points you didn't notice before ect. Or it leaves one with such a depth of emotional meaning it all but demands to be viewed again and again.

  This story real doesn't have those things. I don't notice new plot points or bits of dialogue. And the only major emotional resonance it has for me is the warm effectively written parting of the ways between the Doctor and Sarah at the end of the story.

  The story has some strong points among them the excellent acting of Judith Paris as Eldrad and the wonderfully creppy acting of Elizabeth Sladen. It's nice to see Elizabeth Sladen get to stretch her acting muscles in her final story.

 This story has an above average look. The Eldrad costume is one of the most memorable and realistic looking costumes ever seen on Doctor Who. The costume and prosthetic work hold up well even by modern science-fiction show standards. And Judith Paris looks stunningly attractive in it. Also this story looks great because good location filming at a real nuclear power station. And I give credit to the unique design of the sets of Eldrad's home world.

  But in the end even with exceptional acting, excellent costumes and good locations and sets. The story it's self is still only a three star affair.

  Now on to the special features. There is a very good and informative commentary featuring,Tom Baker,Elisabeth Sladen and co-writer Bob Baker and Judith Paris who plays Eldrad. Tom has become some what infamous for bad commentary but seems to come to life with Elizabeth Sladen around. I've noticed he's done decent commentary before with Elizabeth and does a decent job with her again here.

  Also I greatly enjoyed the documentary 'Changing Time' wich focuses on what it was like for Tom Baker and Elizabeth Sladen to enter and leave thier respective rolls on Doctor Who. Really good stuff I liked it alot. Good interviews with Tom Baker and Elizabeth Sladen. This also features interviews with other Doctor who actors,writters and directors.

  Another good feature is respectable information text. This disk also features a interview from the 1970's with Elizabeth and Tom on a kids show.

  Anyway an enjoyable if unexceptional story. If your just starting your Tom Baker era Doctor Who collection you might want to start somewhere else. But if you already have an advanced Tom Baker, Doctor Who collection like I do then by all means, decend to the thermal chambers with The Hand of Fear!",1184544000,3,3972,4.718432510885341

854884,5,630430420X,"You've really gotta hand it to ""Doctor Who""--this show knows how to handle science fiction with just the right mixture of intelligence and humor, suspense and speculation, thrilling adventure and thoughtful storytelling. Especially during the 1970's, the producers and writers seem to have had an exceptionally good grasp of this vital mix, and that definitely goes for ""The Hand of Fear""--well, for the most part, anyway.

In the history of this show, English stone quarries have stood in for distant planets more times than you could count on your fingers, but this time it really is what it looks like: a stone quarry. A cute in-joke indeed, but hardly superfluous to the plot, for this is where the Doctor and Sarah Jane come across the fossilized hand featured in the title, and things start going to hell in a handbasket from there as Sarah is possessed by this mysterious remnant of a silicon-based lifeform and carries it to a nuclear power plant, zapping anyone who gets in the way--kudos for Elisabeth Sladen for managing to come across as convincingly sinister and creepy all while decked out in one of the most embarrassingly childish fashion disasters of the '70's.

Much of the story unfolds at the nuclear power plant, where the hand feeds off atomic energy and, using Sarah's genetic blueprint as a sort of manual, succeeds in reconstituting itself into Eldrad, an incredibly gripping character who keeps you guessing as to whether she's indeed a villain until the very end. She's quite a handful, that's for sure--egocentric, paranoid, unpredictable, and very very dangerous, and yet it's hard not to empathize with her somewhat (even the ever-skeptical Doctor does, for that matter). Judith Paris brings this character to life wonderfully, endowing it with very convincingly non-Carbon-based body language and disconcertingly shifty eyes, and her costume is a brilliant piece of handiwork that (just for the record) stands up just fine to today's special effects standards, and that on a soap opera's budget and no such thing as digital effects.

With all that, though, I'm afraid the story kind of starts fumbling a bit in the last of the four episodes. It plays out in too straightforward a fashion and dispenses with subtlety rather abruptly, and the revivified male Eldrad just absolutely does not hold up well in comparison with the prior female version. Still, in the end you've probably never quite seen the Doctor's scarf come in handy so, and the scene where Sarah waves the Doctor goodbye and sets off on her own is nicely poignant if just a tad sudden. Also, Tom Baker as the Doctor is great hands down, it almost goes without saying. So all in all, two thumbs up!",1175212800,4,2693,4.940397350993377
854939,5,630430420X,"I've revived my interest in classic Dr. Who (in particular Tom Baker's Doctor) since purchasing The Key to Time collection for my husband this past Christmas and having a great time!  The Hand of Fear was a particular joy to watch. Tom Baker was well established as the doctor by this time and his working relationship with Elizabeth Sladen was fun and laid back.  It was said that Tom hated to see her leave the role as Sarah Jane, which makes me wonder if he got along with any other actresses portraying his companion afterward (other than Lalla Ward, of course).  Judith Paris as female Eldrad was truely mesmerizing in her crystalline costume, which proved to be a bother, according to Judith speaking about it during the audio commentary.

Speaking of the audio commentary, I recommend watching the episode straight through and then again with the commentary.  It's simply hilarious!  Tom Baker commenting with Elizabeth Sladen was sweet and nostalgic, still treating her as the kid sister he had on television 30 years ago. His commenting with Judith Paris, however, was downright steamy! Here they were, like a couple of hormone feuled teenagers bantering back and forth about the underlying sexuality happening on the screen. Pure fun!

I thought the last five minutes of the episode were fine, but a bit unrealistic.  The doctor's telepathic summons to Gallifrey and the fact that Sarah couldn't come on this adventure was logical enough.  Sarah gathering her things as a bluff, merely because the doctor was preoccupied with TARDIS repairs, was not.  I'm sure the doctor's preoccupations had been bothering her for quite some time, but her actions seemed similar to that of a pre-teen girl not getting the attention she deserved from a much adored, much older, know-it-all brother, as, I suppose, had always been the relation between these two charactors anyway.

So imagine my absolute shock when with David Tennant's 10th doctor, Sarah Jane revealed that she had been in love with the doctor who had left her behind all those years ago and how she had waited for his return for her all this time.  I can't believe the 4th (nor the 3rd) doctor would lead her into having such feelings that he was unable to return (talk about adding to the mystic!). Neither did he make any inclination that he would ever come back for her.  She seemed to understand both conditions at the end of The Hand of Fear.

Even if Sarah Jane had decided otherwise within the last 30 years, can you imagine leaving a tall, imposing figure with wide, dazzling blue eyes, a head full of auburn curls, and a voice to swoon over, only to reveal your feelings to a short, oily, little rat?!",1174003200,,2672,4.793028322440088

This is one of my favorite adventures with the fourth Doctor.  It is also the last of his adventures with his companion Sarah Jane Smith.  This episode had an interesting mixture of pathos and humor different from other episodes in the series.

854943,4,630430420X,"I recently received my copy of this new disc.  I grew up watching Tom Baker's Dr Who on PBS, and always had a crush on Sarah Jane Smith.  I was very disappointed when I saw the end of this episode back then.  The episode itself is very entertaining, but it was Sarah's last adventure with the Doctor.

Now that Dr Who episodes have started appearing on DVD, I find that I again have a crush on Sarah Jane.  :)  She is adorable in all episodes, but particularly this one.

The picture quality on this new DVD is very good.  I was impressed by how clean the picture was, and while not razor sharp, the detail level is pretty good for the age of the episode.  This is the case with all of the Dr Who episodes I own so far, as the BBC provides great effort.  I didn't try surround sound, as the TV speakers work fine for this type of program material.

BBC does a great job with bonus content on these releases, and this one is no exception.  Included is an entertaining commentary with Tom Baker (the Doctor), Elizabeth Sladen (Sarah), the guest star, and others.  Almost as entertaining as the episode itself.  Also included is a near feature length documentary, which is again nearly as entertaining as the episode.  Interesting cinematography in this one, with other commentators sitting in the background on occasion, listening in.  And one of the things that all studios should do: the photo gallery is a playing video that is cut to music/sound effects/etc.  No thumbing the remote to death.  Just sit back and enjoy.

I did not rate 5 stars, as I feel that should be reserved for the very best DVD releases that knock the quality out of the park.  The Alien Quadrilogy (9 discs of superb goodness) would be an example.

If you are a fan of Doctor Who, get this one.  The best Doctor, the best companion, and a good story.  Keep them coming!",1168300800,3,1844,4.438805970149254

I might as well go a burn my own complete episode before it melts if you don't want to do the complete job for me..

854945,5,630430420X,"When I first saw this show in late 1979 on American PBS TV it struck me as a clunky, relatively boring show with weird backdrops.  And when I heard it was being released on DVD I was curious why this was chosen when there were still 3 or 4 other great Hinchcliffe Doctor Who episodes to release.  Then I saw the DVD and realized 'Hand Of Fear' really is clunky, relatively boring with weird backdrops...but, there was so much charm in this episode lost to me when I was 11 years old.

""Hand Of Fear"" is definiely not a prime Tom Baker Doctor Who story, but it is very enjoyable once you get over the simplistic story and lack of believability in the Castrian sets.  Tom Baker, Elizabeth Sladen, and almost every actor on this show made it have weight and charm.  The story isn't bad, but just a little simple, however there was a lot of time used to highlight Sarah as companion, and her relationship with the Doctor.  As a kid the final sequence was heartbreaking.  It still is bitter and sweet despite time.  And Sarah's outlandish outfit is still just as garish, but fun and not as disturbing as many later outfits companions wore in the 80's, or now.

The voice track by Sladen, Baker, Baker (the writer), Paris (Female Eldrad) and bites from Hinchcliffe are fully enjoyable, but aside from warmth and humor not as informative as when you get Hinchcliffe in a full commentary.  The actors and crew of the Hinchcliffe-Holmes era always seem jovial and upbeat compared to the lethargic, nattering, angry tracks produced by crews of the JNT era.

Also included is a nice, by nearly immaterial, documentary about the show with interviews from almost everyone involved in the acting and writing.

""Hand Of Fear"" is a decent enough purchase for the fan.  In my opinion there were far more entertaining serials to release first like ""Deadly Assassin"", ""Face of Evil"", ""Seeds of Doom"", or ""Sontaran Experiment(releasing soon)"".",1164672000,2,1923,4.704477611940298
854946,5,630430420X,"The final two Doctor Who DVD releases for 2006 feature the fourth and sixth Doctors in stories first broadcast in Britain in 1976 and 1985 respectively, both starring rare examples of a female `baddie' as the Time Lord's adversary. The Hand of Fear is certainly an appropriate release for this year as it neatly ties in with the most recent series of new adventures aired on the BBC this past spring. The Mark of The Rani comes from the ill-fated twenty-second season of the long running show and is certainly one of the highlights of that year's much maligned canon.

The Hand of Fear was the second story of six from season fourteen, possibly the most lauded and certainly (in terms of ratings) the most consistently popular season from the show's original twenty-six year run. It was the third to star Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor under the Production of Philip Hinchcliffe and Script Editor Robert Holmes. Joining the Doctor for the start of her fourth year in the role was Sarah-Jane Smith, the feminist journalist portrayed so brilliantly and convincingly by Elisabeth Sladen. However, Sladen only appeared in the first two stories in this season, this being her last. The script comes from Bob Baker and Dave Martin, two veteran writers on the show who generally contributed at least one script per season from 1971 to 1979. I'm not a great fan of their stories, possibly due to a personal prejudice arising from their horrendous Three Doctors script that marked the series' tenth anniversary. But The Hand of Fear is certainly strong, but for me it's one of the weaker efforts in such a stand-out season. What makes this story so memorable and perhaps so fondly remembered is that it features the departure of Sarah-Jane, at the time, the longest running consecutive companion.

Sladen is given the key role in the early episodes of this story and plays a wonderful, possessed villainess who creates havoc in a nuclear power plant. Alas though, and she admits this herself in the commentary, when not possessed, Sladen goes completely over the top and hams it up as Sarah-Jane in the rest of the story. Perhaps due to the pressure of the situation, her performance becomes quite irritating. This is redeemed almost completely in the closing moments of episode four, when having threatened to leave the Doctor, he in turn `evicts' her from the TARDIS. Their final farewell (largely scripted by the two actors themselves) is touching and moving and well worth the price of the DVD alone. The real villain of the story, Eldrad of Kastria, is played for almost two episodes by Judith Paris, and it has to be said that she pretty much steals the entire show, both in her performance and the quite fabulous costume and make-up.

Another female baddie show's up almost nine years later in The Mark of The Rani, the third story from Colin Baker's first full season as the Doctor, broadcast in the spring of 1985. Kate O'Mara takes on the role of the Rani, a villainous Time Lady, interfering with the Luddite period of Earth's history in order to carry our scientific experiments. O'Mara had worked with Baker before on the hugely popular BBC drama series The Brothers, and the chemistry between the two actors is wonderful, although alas, they spend precious little time on screen together. The supporting cast is strong in general, but alas, the two leads (Baker and Nicola Bryant) are just not suited to their characterizations, and their on screen bickering is tiresome, as is Bryant's phoney, whiney American accent and Baker's bullying Doctor. Also here to spoil things is the desperately hammy Anthony Ainley as the Doctor's other Time Lord enemy, The Master; a pantomime villain who was well past his sell-by date by this time, but was contracted to appear in all Doctor Who seasons in this era. It's a shame that the three lead performances from the regulars are so weak, as the story is certainly strong and the wonderful location filming gives the show a very much needed senses of reality. O'Mara makes up for a lot and was so successful in the role that she was invited back two years later to help kick-start Sylvester McCoy's ill-fated run as the seventh Doctor. She plays the part with conviction and humor, and is compelling enough to forgive the weaknesses of the scripting.

Both of these stories have been wonderfully restored to their original broadcast quality (or possibly even better), which in the case of The Hand of Fear is possibly not such a great thing as it now becomes a little obvious how the some of the effects with the hand are done; nuances that were missed on the lower grade video tape. The extras included on both discs are fantastic - as the Doctor Who extras always are. There are behind the scenes documentaries, interviews with the cast and crew, out-takes, deleted scenes, continuity announcements, Easter Eggs, and features from other BBC shows related to these two stories. The only minor criticism would be that the ""Changing Time"" documentary included with The Hand of Fear covers a lot of ground that isn't necessarily relevant to this story and might have been better used with other releases. But it's a great little piece regardless. The commentary from Tom Baker on this disc is completely hysterical and the actor is at his comic best, even though he recalls precious little of the actual story. He is joined by writer Bob Baker and for some episodes by Sladen, Paris and Hinchcliffe. Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Kate O'Mara provide an entertaining commentary on The Mark of The Rani. Alas, in both cases, a lot of the on screen production notes and the behind-the scenes documentaries cover a lot of the same ground, so there is much repetition.

With Elizabeth Sladen returning to play Sarah-Jane Smith soon on British screens in her own TV series, following her much lauded re-appearance with David Tennant's tenth Doctor earlier this year, her final story from her original run is a great reminder of the bridge between the two. It's wonderful to see her in the role again and hopefully her new adventures will be as popular as her original run.",1163203200,3,6109,4.819828408007626
854947,5,630430420X,"This has always been a great favorite among fans of the Doctor, and also a moment of great sadness.  Sarah Jane has long been the best loved of all the Doctor's companions, and her heartbreaking departure has long left a hole in the hearts of her many fans.

Now that this important story is finally available, it is a must for all Doctor Who fans, particularly those who have only recently discovered the doctor in his 9th and 10th incarnations.  Apart from the tiny ""blip"" in the storyline (K-9 & Company) where the Doctor ships K-9 to Sarah for a Christmas present, and when Sarah has a freak-chance encounter with several other incarnations of the Doctor (The Five Doctors), we have been left for decades with a shoe that never dropped, and countless fanzines trying to answer the questions of what was really between the Doctor and Sarah, why he really left her behind, what she did afterwards, etc.

""School Reuinion"" finally answers these questions.  I urge the younger fans, who are discovering the relationship between Sarah and the Doctor for the first time, to buy a copy of ""Hand of fear"" and any one of a dozen earlier stories with Sarah and the 4th (and 3rd) Doctor.  We all now know that Sarah really was in love with the Doctor, and we also know why the Doctor could not allow himself to love her in return.  We all ""knew"" these things, but now it has been made part of the official canon.

854948,3,630430420X,"The 1975-6 season of Doctor Who is one of the most popular, despite the fact that almost every story that features within it pays homage and liberally borrows from cinema. Viewed today we can see this season as being an example of a post-modern appropriation, but at this time post-modern theory was in its total infancy. Doctor Who was once again forging ahead and showing its innovation where other programmes lagged behind.  The reference point for HAND OF FEAR can be taken as far back as the 1926 with ORLACS HANDE directed by ROBERT WEINE who a few years before had also directed THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. His film was remade twice first as MAD LOVE and then the British horror HANDS OF ORLAC, which I like to think is the purer reference that Bob Baker and Dave Martin had in mind. Like a good many Doctor Who stories the first two episodes are excellent. Some wonderful use of location work adds a reality to the story that a cheap BBC set would only have undermined. The hand is an extremely effective special effect and Elisabeth Sladen in her swansong is given much more to than usual. Her trance like state is genuinely chilling and well played. Sadly things take a downward turn when the action moves to Kastria. And the final episode is especially disappointing, Stephen Thorne's overacting is hilarious to behold and on one occasion you can see Baker and Sladen visibly trying not to burst out laughing. This all adds to the enjoyment however. As a finale for Sarah Jane HAND OF FEAR does seem somewhat dissatisfying, but the opening two episodes are as good as any in Tom Baker's long tenure as the Doctor.",1156809600,,1625,4.622837370242214
