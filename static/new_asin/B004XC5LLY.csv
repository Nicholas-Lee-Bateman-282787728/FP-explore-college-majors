4493763,3,B004XC5LLY,A tragic tale of how drugs destroy lives of the users and those that care about them.,1469232000,,85,4.0588235294117645
4493764,1,B004XC5LLY,"This was an awful movie!  I just watched it on Netflix. The Acting was awful. The actors who portrayed the supposedly true couple in real life were not likable.  In the description it says ""this movie was based on actual events.""  I do feel badly for the real couple that this movie was based on. However, using drugs and then driving out in a blizzard with freezing temps and having hallucinations is a sure way to disaster.  Hope this review and the other bad reviews will help potential buyers think twice about getting this movie, especially at the current price of $24.95.",1469232000,3,577,4.627450980392157
4493765,2,B004XC5LLY,"I tried three times to watch this movie, but it just didn't keep my interest, so finally  I fast forwarded to the ending. Well, of course that is going to happen when you're lost in a raging blizzard. Glad that I didn't waste my time watching it.",1469232000,,246,4.23404255319149
4493766,1,B004XC5LLY,I could barely get through 10 minutes of this dud before I turned it off. The acting alone is atrocious.,1468886400,,104,4.25

4493769,1,B004XC5LLY,"Shelley and Ryan are a young couple who get stranded during a raging blizzard and must fight for survival while the authorities try desperately to locate them. This movie is based on a true story of what happened to a young couple back in 2005. The characters are so unlikable in the film, that you find yourself rooting for their demise. The acting is horrible, so is the direction. This is like a really bad made for lifetime television movie. Even a solid actress like Mimi Rogers who gives the best performance in the movie, is still noticeably bad in this totally amateur production.",1393891200,6,588,4.663461538461538
4493770,5,B004XC5LLY,"This is a tragic true story of kids who did not realize the power of Drugs .... and even sadder, that this story happens every day all over the world.

4493775,1,B004XC5LLY,"Insipid, dull, thin plot....Mimi Rogers?  Would have given it zero stars, but didn't have that option. Cut our losses half way in, and still felt like we were ripped off for the hour we can't get back.",1474156800,,201,4.4324324324324325

4493801,4,B004XC5LLY,"This film was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be another stupid, found footage horror movie, but it was a self inflicted horror that the protagonists dealt with. It was not the best movie I have watched, but it was unexpected.",1470700800,,241,4.377777777777778
