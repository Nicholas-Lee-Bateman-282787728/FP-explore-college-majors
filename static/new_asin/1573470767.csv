192252,5,1573470767,"I just love Kris Lemche. I think he is a great actor. I just loved the way Peter handle things in the movie. He was smart and very cute.
This movie is a great movie to watch with your family. It is one of the best family  movies I have seen in a while. The rest of the cast were great as well.  Peter and Benjamin just had me rolling. The only word to describe their  come backs is Sacrasm. I just love it.",939168000,2,406,3.8095238095238093

7798295,2,1573470767,Pretty much a waste of time.  It played in the backgrounds while I was cooking and never was interesting enough for me to really watch.,1502064000,,135,4.4

7798299,3,1573470767,Cool idea but the helmet is REALLY small. Seems to hold together well. In our house we might get a few weeks out of it before it is destroyed.,1483228800,,142,3.9310344827586206

7798301,1,1573470767,"If acting, screen play and directing was bad, I'd give it two stars.  There is no way to give it negative rating, so one start it is.

On a bright side, my 8 year old liked it.",1481673600,,176,3.72972972972973
7798302,4,1573470767,"Peter is a teenager and he wins a contest that sends him to a theme park in Europe.  The park is meant to be an immersive high tech Westworld type experience.  But this is a family movie so there is no graphic violence, etc..  But hundreds of years ago Lord Drakin attempted to overthrow the kingdom but failed.  He did have an evil sorcerer to help him and a curse was passed that caused the castle and its occupants from the future to be transported to the past.  This mostly rendered the tech in the castle mostly useless because electricity & cellphones service are lacking in medieval Europe.  So it's up to the contest winners, a group of kids because no adults won the contest, & a reporter and her cameraman to save the modern owner of the castle & break the curse so they can get home.  Fortunately they do have some help in the form of Percival the court wizard who was held captive.  The special effects seem kind of low budget and it feels like a direct to dvd movie plus it was made in 1998 but in the end I liked it.",1481241600,,1030,4.219387755102041
7798303,1,1573470767,"We just couldn't get into it.  It was boring and a bit weird as the mouths didn't match up with the dialogue, not like foreign language dubbing, but almost like the actors were lip syncing and over exaggerating, very odd!  The acting was barely as good as some High School productions.  My 4 year old lost interest in it.",1481241600,,321,4.406779661016949
