6438192,5,B00KPY016E,Awesome. More suspenseful than horror for me. Had me on the edge of my seat. Left me thinking there may be a part 2? Would recommend this brilliant movie to everyone. In fact watching again today.,1402704000,6,196,4.472222222222222
6438193,4,B00KPY016E,"Just viewed the film.  I love horror films.  I can't say this is true horror but it has the feel.  If you are looking for gore or a slasher, not here.  Scary and suspenseful yes.  It was great to see Joe Estevez in another indie horror!  There were some weak spots but the lead, Randall Oliver and his side kick, the mohawk dude was very good.",1402444800,9,343,4.121212121212121
6438194,4,B00KPY016E,"I like movies based on True Stories, & Mythology, with action & suspense. This movie has a good plot to bring out the Cajun folklore.
Defiantly a good movie for the collection.",1402444800,3,176,4.53125
6438195,4,B00KPY016E,I had the opportunity to view this flick in a theater when it was shown in Baton Rouge.  The story line is wonderful and the locations are traditional Louisiana.  My family really enjoyed being able to see and hear things that were done in true Louisiana style!  Great job folks!!,1401840000,10,280,4.56
6438196,5,B00KPY016E,This movie is a great mix of action / drama / suspense / scifi set in the swamps of Louisiana where the legendary Rugaru lives.,1401840000,8,127,4.12
6438197,1,B00KPY016E,More talk than action,1464998400,,21,4.5
6438198,1,B00KPY016E,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS TERRIBLE!!! I could not even finish watching it because it was so stupid.  I did not understand the plot either.  This is just a waste of money!!!,1464307200,,177,4.176470588235294

6438202,2,B00KPY016E,"I actually lived in Louisiana for approx. 5 years and I am familiar with different areas and cultures within the state. This movie is bad. The acting was bad, the sound quality was bad and it presented the typical stereotype of southern backwoods people as being ignorant and just plain stupid. I had friends and acquaintances who were Cajun and none of them were like the characters portrayed in this movie. To make it worse, the whole movie reeked. The only decent actor was the monster and all he did was yell.  Do not pay to see this...",1445904000,,540,4.510204081632653

6438205,1,B00KPY016E,"It does show a glimpse of a creature, looked like Skunk ape. In the film, just a bunch of conversation with locals, that don't add anything to the film.
The most involved part of the film, is the locals just don't get along and that seems to be the pace and drama of the film.

6438212,4,B00KPY016E,"I remembered Randy (excuse me, ""Randall"") from when we were kids in Germany and was curious to see if the guy can act, so I got my family to watch the movie...  We were impressed (the guy can really act)!  However, the music sometimes overpowered the actor's voices, and the creature was laughable.",1418774400,2,298,4.60377358490566

6438222,3,B00KPY016E,"I give Rugaru 3 stars because I liked it.  I can't argue with any review that rakes this movie over the coals for bad acting, writing, directing, sound, etc.  Almost shut it off after the first scene.  I really can't think of any of my friends that I'd recommend this to because they'd think I'm nuts.  I liked this movie because it has some scenes that were actually really well done and it all came together.  Randall Oliver ranges from decent to very good.  I had also never heard of a rugaru so this was a learning experience.  So, I see some potential in the director/writer and some of the cast.  There's a good chance that some future project for these folks will be a hit.  Maybe they can rework it like Evil Dead II reworked ED I.  It also seems to have been a labor of love for the people involved which shows in a real down-to-earth quality of the movie.  That goes a long ways with me.  The good in Rugaru was enough to get me through the rough spots.  Am I adding Rugaru to my video library?  No, but it was worth the 2 bucks I paid to rent it and the time watching it.",1411344000,,1082,4.139423076923077

6438229,4,B00KPY016E,"I enjoyed the movie and thought Randall Oliver done a great and convincing job with his character from showing the tough exterior of a Cajun parole officer, to a broken, troubled man, and going right into a softhearted, loving father with tears rolling down his cheeks because of the love he feels for his daughter. I also thought Christopher Severio done an outstanding job.",1405987200,,375,4.875

6438239,3,B00KPY016E,"The acting is very second rate, and the transition between scenes is jolting. But it's a low, low budget film, and that inevitably means using unseasoned actors, inexperienced directors, and so forth. This is definitely a b-rated film, and it has more technical flaws than I can list, but in a campy way, it's kind of cute. And I will say that it was not boring. I think it deserves an ""Okay"" rating because of that.",1404518400,7,416,4.4868421052631575

6438241,4,B00KPY016E,"This was a good combination of supernatural, horror, humor, and even some nasty drug dealers. The hero is a parole officer, his father-in-law is the sheriff of some little bayou town in Louisiana. The hero is divorced from the sheriff's daughter, and has trouble getting visits from his child. All this blends in with a monster called Rugaru.

Trust me folks, I love these type of flicks but this is a sad sorry excuse of a movie, & that 6-rating is just so they can try to cheat people into paying for it. Yes I know it's only $1.99. That's completely missing the point. Anyhow, just do yourself a favor & skip this poopoo. But IF u do watch it  (altho I am screaming at u not to, plz!), check out that scene in the beginning, I think it's one of the first times we see Bigfoot. It's when that voodoo queen sics ol Biggy on those poor boys (sounds great so far ey folks?). How about that one-punch fight? Are u kidding me?",1505865600,,736,3.972972972972973
