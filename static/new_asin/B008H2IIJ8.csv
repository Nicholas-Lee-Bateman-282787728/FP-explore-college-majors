8527900,1,B008H2IIJ8,"Although the Wall Street Journal allegedly described C(H)OEURS as ""enthralling"", it should be understood that this review is from someone who failed, utterly, to appreciate, understand or be inspired in any way by this production from Teatro Real, even after three viewings.  There have been some marvelous contemporary ballets released recently -  C(H)OEURS is certainly NOT one of them but a production which may appeal only to those who appreciate the extreme avant-garde.  Or those who can afford to waste money.

The production opens with an anorexic female dancer who, under the harsh glare of an overhead spotlight, slowly lifts her dress to expose her bare buttocks for what seems like an eternity.  It is not a good look.  Next, a naked male moves around the stage all the while concealing his genitalia with admirable dexterity.  The full complement of dancers emerge and for the next two hours treat us to a never-ending series of spasms and convulsions akin to the antics of the mentally deranged.

The narration interspersing the selection of Verdi and Wagner musical gems is banal, childish.  Chapter 8 establsihes a stomping rhythm which, according to the accompanying booklet, is meant to be the Haka.  The Haka is sacred to New Zealanders, Maori and Pakeha alike: to bastardize the Haka in any manner, as here in Madrid, is insulting.  We are finally rewarded with a duet/pas de deux (danced to the prelude from La Traviata) which is actually quite beautiful but is too little, too late.  The production concludes with dancers disrobing, some of the choir members foolishly following suit.

From the accompanying material we are infomred that C(H)OEURS is a scream of protest over injustices in today's world.  Having experienced the 1960s protest movements in New Zealand and Berkeley, California, then the American Civil Rights Movement, this expression of protest from Madrid is no scream but a whimper.  The interivews included on the disc over-assert that the nudity is not to shock, that is, until the musical director gives the game away when he declares his intent is not to send audiences to sleep.  Theater-goers have come a long way since the musical HAIR opened half a century ago: the nudity in C(H)OEURS fails to shock as it was meant to do - quite simply, it serves no purpose.

The only scream of protest this production generates is from viewers whose time and money have been wasted.",1431216000,,2418,4.9900249376558605
8527901,4,B008H2IIJ8,"A typical Alain Platel piece with the dancers of les ballets C de la B and the Chorus of the Teatro Real, Madrid, that is full of symbolism and makes a statement on the way individuals and groups feel silenced and how they find ways to demonstrate with and without words in protest against the things that are happening in their countries today. For example, the throwing of one shoe, or the pinning of a red target to themselves. The accompanying booklet has an excellent article explaining the philosophy behind the piece.",1355443200,2,524,4.706521739130435
