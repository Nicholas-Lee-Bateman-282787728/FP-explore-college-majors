8150384,2,B000JHOD7U,"I was searching for a non-stripping-related Chinese movie on Amazon and came across this funny little VHS tape. Apparently it's 45 minutes in duration, which seems like a painfully long time to watch somebody strip all their clothes off. Does one really need video instruction for this? I've never attempted stripping for a man, so maybe it's more complex than I know, but I doubt those who strip professionally had formal schooling for their work (or even watched a video like this). I'm able to play VHS tapes through my PC using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-device/dp/B0040FT30O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this device</a>&nbsp;so am almost tempted to find out why this is 45 minutes long (but not for $11).

Okay, I looked on ebay and found a picture revealing wording from the back of the jacket. There are plenty of blurbs about the woman who teaches in the video (""GiO"": does anyone remember her from the 90s? I don't...) from publications of that decade, such as:
- Pupils are, ""Yuppies, Blue Jeans, Minks, Librarians, Fatties, Skinnies, Professionals..."" states the New York Daily News (funny how some terminology has changed since the 20th century... ""Skinnies"" are now wearable Instant Thigh Lifts; are people still deemed ""Yuppies""? Maybe ""Minx"" instead of ""Minks""? Is ""Blue Jeans"" code for country / working class white folks? I am so out of touch...)
- ""GiO travels around the country in the interest of saving marriages, getting and keeping boyfriends, getting husbands, and generally averting boredom in the bedroom.""

As a man, I'd just like to say that if this video is necessary to save a marriage or avert bedroom boredom, then the relationship may not be a keeper to begin with...",1466899200,,1751,5.294964028776978
