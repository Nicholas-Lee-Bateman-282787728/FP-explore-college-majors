7203621,5,B00XX9KLI6,"Part 16 starts and ends as a cliffhanger. A lot of questions answered, but the core question of ""What happened to the dragons?"", which is THE question for Fairy Tail fans, is addressed and answered...(mostly)! Have all seasons up to 16 but stopped at 15 because the story was all over. 16 renewed my interest by giving me answers to the questions that lingered since the beginning.",1464912000,2,381,4.701492537313433

7203628,4,B00XX9KLI6,Well Mastered. I just always wish the subtitles and English dubbing matched and you didn't need both of them to get all the nuances of the storyline :),1448323200,,151,4.428571428571429
7203629,5,B00XX9KLI6,My husband likes this series,1446595200,,28,4.8
7203630,3,B00XX9KLI6,"Besides costing as much as it did, they change the animation for the worst. All the exceeds are drawn horribly, all the colors are off too, and half the time it's like you're looking at a talking picture because non of the background characters are even moving, just really irritating after 175 epi of a great adventure. Can't give it less than three stars because it is still fairytale",1446508800,,386,4.608695652173913

7203634,5,B00XX9KLI6,So this is the part where we meet the dragons. This is a great family series. You can't help but to root for Natsu and lucy. In this part there is death of some main characters... made me and my kid shed some tears but keep watching .,1443398400,,234,3.8958333333333335

7203647,4,B00XX9KLI6,"A hiatus of almost exactly 1 year separated Episodes 175 and 176 in the Japanese anime series of Fairy Tail so I am pleasantly surprised that our wait between DVD sets 15 and 16 will be only about 5 months.  Good thing because the hiatus occurred right smack in the middle of a storyline just as it was getting exciting.  For one thing, the final event of the Grand Magic Games has yet to be played, a contest very similar to the Hunger Games.  Or perhaps not.  I just need to get my David Letterman fix here now that he's retired.

Top 10 Reasons the Grand Magic Games Are Not Like the Hunger Games

10. It's over in one day, which definitely saves on the catering bill.
9. There are 30 competitors, not just 24.  The more the merrier.
8. The genders aren't balanced equally (there are 21 guys and only 9 girls).  Which will make the victory party dates a bit awkward.
7. The competitors don't get goody packages from sponsors, which proves wizards are much tougher than the rest of us.
6. It isn't a government intimidation tactic; it's the government's means of gathering magic power for a time travel device.  Weird, huh?
5. The government doesn't force you to watch, which makes it much more fun to watch anyway.
4. They don't fire a cannon or show somebody's face in the sky when they're defeated.  Why promote the losers?
3. It happens right in the middle of the capital city, not in a fabricated forest full of traps.  Much nicer, right?
2. There are no weapons strewn about.  Who needs weapons when everybody can use magic?
And the number 1 reason:  Nobody actually dies, although some of the competitors are definitely out for blood.

But the climax of the Grand Magic Games is just the covering for a much larger impending crisis involving the legendary dark wizard Zeref, some dangerous wizards from the future, and a multitude of angry dragons.  This storyline won't be wrapped up until the end of Part 17,  but at least we should be getting that one later in the fall.  Meanwhile, enjoy the Fairy Tail streaming videos on the Funimation website.",1432857600,5,2059,4.536585365853658
