1799299,5,B0000714F3,"""Raising Tennis Aces"" is an insightful look into the tennis phenoms Venus and Serena Williams.  But more than that, this documentary takes the viewer into an in-depth look at the force behind these two players; their father, Richard Williams.

Mr. Williams' upbringing in the deep south embedded a philosophy of family devotion, pride, respect of ones' self, hard work, perserverance, resourcefulness, strength, power and faith that he obviously instilled into Venus and Serena.

This film shows that is takes more than just physical strength to overcome your opponent; whether it be on a tennis court or off.  I admire what Mr. Williams did with these two great athletes.  Everything they have, they can outrightly claim they earned.  You don't have to have country club money to be a winner.  But possessing the internal workings of a mind that is set, focused, dedicated and ready to withstand all of the stumbling blocks that can be thrown in ones' path is found in this story.

It is a great documentary, and the viewer is priviliged to be invited into the Williams' world.",1296777600,5,1078,4.95
1799300,5,B0000714F3,"I studied many success stories of many greats past & present.  By far Richard and the producers of this dvd have done a great job. The documenting of the Williams sisters was warm, entertaining, as well as educationally informative.  With heart, dedication, the right amount of effort (work) and determination any thing is possible. What I loved the most was Richard's ""no pressure"" approach to training the sisters in a tight-knit family.  I just couldn't believe I knew so little about the Williams family story.",1278633600,6,514,5.023529411764706
1799301,5,B0000714F3,The Williams sisters - Venus and Serena - changed the game of women's tennis by adding power to the game. This DVD tells their story and shows them in their youth on the tennis court and with their family. Serena had so much energy. Richard Williams tells some of his story in learning the game of tennis and teaching his girls different training techniques that helped their games and sent both of them to the number one position in the sport.,1223510400,7,444,4.493827160493828
1799302,5,B0000714F3,"i treasure this dvd because it demonsrates that with a goal in mind-belief in one's can do attitude,regardless of the ridicule and negative attitudes of others- anyone has the ability to reach for the stars.

I'M really inspired and I salute Mr Richard Williams for the values He instilled in his children to not let anybody sidetrack their focus on their goals and also He taught me of the importance of family support.",1148601600,12,420,4.7534246575342465
1799303,5,B0000714F3,"A look ""behind the scenes"" and behind the hype, at the Williams family.  The story is augmented by footage of a training session at their compound, and old home movie footage of Venus and Serena.
The story is one that's not often told in perspective, and is really pretty interesting.  Father Richard Williams had a rough life.  He grew up poor (in rural Louisiana), with his absent father living down the street and providing nothing.  He watched one childhood friend get run down by a white woman in a car, apparently intentionally.  (Williams shows us the tree he planted at the time, in his friend's honor, now a large flowering tree).  He had a nail driven into his leg because he wouldn't call a white man ""sir"" on a golf course.  He had nothing.  He moved to Compton, worked menial jobs, eventually worked his way to having his own security company.  He had the idea to train future children to play tennis, because there was money in it.  He subsequently trained Venus and Serena, unconventionally, while raising them (with his wife) to reflect what he describes as values that were strong in past eras - including love of family and poise under stressful circumstance.  You can see where his goals in raising them mirror the same goals most of us have in raising children - for them to be happy AND to understand how to take responsibility for their own lives.
Not everything possible is here - Oracene/Brandy (the mother) isn't featured at all, and there are a few hard question that could be asked that aren't.  But what is here is interesting and inspirational.  The DVD has a nice set of extra interviews and extra footage.",1046908800,33,1636,4.658536585365853

1799339,5,B0000714F3,"This is a beautiful documentary on a very important and usually overlooked chapter of U.S. History.  A pleasant and fun account of how a very poor and socially despised young black man raised two of his daughters to be the world's champion tennis players, did it with them in Compton, California, and later parts East.  The little girls are adorable and gifted; their father is loving, very creative and wise.  Get ready to laugh, get ready to grip the edges of your seats; and get ready to grow, learn, and understand.",1376092800,,519,4.681318681318682
