447322,5,6302277507,"I am one of those who are not huge fans of historical fiction because it tends to provide a view of things as the author (and readers) wishes they had been rather than provide insights into how the events actually were.  There are exceptions to this, of course.  On the other hand, there are also fictions that take place in and near historical settings, but are clear that they are fictions and the realities that are included are really not the important aspects of the story.

In the nineteenth century such stories were called romances. I still regret that the romance has been taken over by romance novels that are a certain kind of love story for a female audience.  In the world of serious art, Romantic music is not love music (although love is a frequent topic).  In painting, for example, Pre-Raphaelite art is Romantic, but not necessarily love stories.  The identifying characteristics were adventure, myth, and struggle.  And, yes, there was often a princess to be saved or some kind of love to be fought for and won.  ""The Work and the Glory"" is really a Romantic work in this sense.

While it would be easy for Mormons to identify Joseph Smith as by far the most important character in this movie, that would be a mistake in understanding this movie on its own terms.  In this movie the story is about the Steed family who move to western New York to a tract of land next to Martin Harris.  Joseph Smith figures into the story of course, but it is more about the effect his mission has on the family rather than the story of Joseph himself.  Some have criticized the work because it doesn't follow this or that aspect of Joseph's story (whether for or against the Church he founded), but that misses the point.

Some of the Steeds come to believe in what Joseph tells Nathan Steed and others reject his message in various ways.  Some believe he is of the devil, some could not care less because they don't believe in any kind of religion, and some because of social pressures.  This movie is only the first part of the story and if you know Mormon history, you can guess where the Steeds will end up.  Just remember that the version of the Church presented is the way the Steeds perceive it rather than as a scholar or a true believer or some other third party would perceive it.  That Nathan would have heard a version of the First Vision that did not include Joseph's struggle with Darkness before he saw the Pillar of Light is perfectly believable.

The production values of the movie are quite good even to the extent of having the Erie Canal running down the main street of Palmyra.  The costumes all look good and the acting is professional to the level of a very good mini-series.  I look forward to the other installments.

Members will enjoy this fiction to the extent that they can remember that this is a story about the Steed family and not about Joseph.  They must also remember to never take this story for history.  It is an entertainment and shows to some extent the way the early Saints suffered because of the way their faith divided families, friends, and towns.  Non-members can also enjoy this story as a drama and in getting some rough idea of how the Church began.  Again, just don't take it as history.  Enjoy it for what it is.",1120953600,10,3267,4.504244482173175

447324,5,6302277507,I loved this movie. As I am LDS I think it is fantastic that movies like this are being shown in theaters and the DVD releases are in stores nationwide.

447325,5,6302277507,"We received the DVD this morning, set up our multi-regional player and sat down to watch a great story with some trepidation.

How could a movie match the quality of the book. It didn't. What we watched was a brilliant translation to the screen of a breath taking story told by a writer who should be far better known than he is.

The sets were good, the photography truly beautiful. The capturing of sunsets and a stormy night for dramatic tension were superbly captured.

Both of our children, aged ten and fourteen, sat through the entire movie as captivated as ourselves, and they haven't read the book.

We cannot wait for the next installment.

447326,2,6302277507,"I guess I have to pour some cold water here. While other reviewers have praised this movie based on its family values and wholesome entertainment, I have to say that there are many other movies out there with the same stuff but of higher quality.

The movie, Work and the Glory which is based on the book written by Gerald Lund proves to be rather weak. It captured the spirit of the book but not the spirit of the people of the book. The actors in this movie looked like they never done a hard day's work, spent too much time in their air conditioned trailers waiting for their scenes as their pale skins reflects indoor people, not outdoor farmer types. To be perfectly honest, not once did I believed that these people on screen were actually hard working folks of Lund's book.

I was also disappointed in the actor who played Joseph Smith. I really didn't see that charismatic leader, just an another bland actor who seem to step off a soap opera TV studio. Funny that I brought up the soap opera theme since the movie did played a lot like a soap opera with that dominate romantic love triangle story.

I do praised the relatively high production value of this movie though. The camera works proves excellent, the art direction reflects the money that went into it, even the all too clean costumes show good history. Technically speaking, its a fine film but as a movie trying to tell a story, it fall pretty flat.

For less demanding audience who only want to see 21st century Americans living and dressing up like early 19th century Americans, I supposed the movie can satisfied. But if you were looking for a movie that reflect the period as describe in the book, this is not the movie for it. I would be surprised if there will be a sequel and if there were, we can hope that Beverly Hills 90102 group can get little grubblier.",1116028800,8,1836,4.471641791044776
447327,5,6302277507,"This is an excellent movie! The cinematography is very artistic, and a lot of effort was taken to be true the times. The movie also stays very close to the book, with only a few minor exceptions. While the movie obviously features certain events from the early history of the LDS Church, those of other faiths should be able to watch it without feeling like they are being proselyted. The spiritual events are treated with a reverent brevity. The movies moral of religious tolerance should appeal to those of many faiths.

The DVD special features include the original theatrical trailer for the movie and a commentary voiced by the Director and the Director of Photography.

Overall, I felt that the movie was very well done, with some amazing pieces of acting portraying some very emotional scenes. Of course, given the source, there is no foul language (that I could find) and no innapropriate scenes (unless you count a handful of short kissing scenes).",1115510400,18,957,4.865030674846626

447415,5,6302277507,"I'll start this review by saying I am not a Mormon.  I did recently talk to a couple of their missionaries and while I find the religion interesting I ultimately chose not to leave my church.  While babysitting my nephew I came across the 3rd part of this series on the BYU channel that I don't have in my own cable package.  I watched for a bit, but since it was not the story from the beginning I decided to turn it off, start from the beginning, and I ordered this dvd since it was on sale for like $4.

I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the depictions of the characters to be fairly realistic.  I generally do not like any form of Christian entertainment if it is written by Christians, since they tend to avoid the bad language and activities that people who are either not religious or whom are going through a crisis might use/engage in.  To me this pulls me out of the stories.  A prime example of this is the first book in the left behind series which uses the phrase ""opinions are like egos, everyone has one"" which was uttered by an adulterous pilot.  A christian author will usually not use profanity in a book which depicts a character who would.  I find it distracting.

That being said, I didn't get the sense that the LDS was beating the theology over my head or shoving Joseph Smith as American Moses down my throat.  The prophet was shown to be a regular man, and the people around him distrusted him, though him a liar, physically attacked him, etc.  Families are torn about whether to trust this man, or write him off as a lunatic or a man deceived by the devil.  These are realistic responses to someone who claims to be visited by angels and be in possession of a secret book he can't show anyone.

So regardless if you are a member of the LDS or Community of Christ or not, if you want to know a little about the history of the church and its people, what times were like in America back then, then check this out.  Not all the characters are historical, the main family it follows is a fictional one, but it still gives some realistic representations.  Its adult enough to keep a regular secular audience entertained, and its still family friendly enough to be able to watch this with kids.  I liked it enough to want to order the rest of them, and I might actually just pick up the books they are based off of.",1357516800,4,2338,4.323394495412844

Mormon Prophet Admits He Believes in Another Christ
Paris, France - In a surprising admission during last month's three nation European speaking trip, Mormon president Gordon B. Hinckley stated that the Christ he believes in is not the same Christ as the one followed by those outside the LDS Church.

It is interesting that Hinckley states that the beliefs of traditional Christians were so different than that of Latter-day Saints, that their traditional Jesus ""is not the Christ of whom I speak."" It is not just some different information about the same Jesus but a completely different Jesus.
Christians should ask, ""Which Christ?"" The Bible warns of false teachers who promote ""another Jesus whom we have not preached"" (2 Corinthians 11:4)

Polygamy:

Under threat of exile to Mexico the Mormon church officially abolished polygamy in the earthly realm in 1890. However, by virtue of secret temple ceremonies Mormon males like Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, as well as contemporary Mormon leaders remain sealed to multiple wives in the heavenly realm. Thus, the practice of polygamy promoted by Smith - who, by the way, had 27 plural wives, and Young, who had 55 wives and 57 children - was merely transferred to the Celestial Kingdom.

By relegating polygamy to the eternal realm Mormon leaders managed to comply externally with societal norms while still maintaining an eschatological basis for the subjugation of women. Such spiritual sanctioning of polygamy was not only an affront to the value and dignity of women, but stands in direct opposition to Jesus' teaching that at the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage.

The Mormon practice of polygamy finds its genesis in the teachings and practices of Joseph Smith who, in 1843, received an eternally binding revelation. According to Smith, apart from the practice of polygamy there was no hope of attaining to godhood. The everlasting commandment of polygamy revealed to Smith was considered so binding that Brigham Young ominously declared ""If any deny the plurality of wives and continue to do so, I promise you that you will be damned.""

And, of course, the Old Testament clearly reveals the strife and temptations that accompany the practice. Solomon, of course, is the quintessential example of one whose legacy of faithfulness was compromised because of his polygamous behavior. Despite world-renowned wisdom Solomon's peaceful and prosperous rule ended in idolatrous strife, scandal and in civil strife as well because the Bible tells us his wives turned his heart after other gods. There is, therefore, absolutely no biblical support for the Mormon practice of polygamy either in this life or the next.

Mormonism and the Claim to Restoration:

In response to this teaching, we should ask Mormons exactly how the church could manage to glorify God ""throughout all generations"" -- as the Apostle Paul clearly wrote in Ephesians 3:21 -- if they fell into total apostasy. We should also point out that Ephesians 4:11-16 talks about the church growing spiritually mature, not spiritually degenerate. The Bible does affirm that there will be apostates, but according to 1 Timothy 4:1 only ""some [not all] will abandon the faith."" This passage alone is enough to prove that Mormonism is wrong about the church falling away altogether.

Smith and other Mormons need to realize that they're teaching the exact opposite of what Jesus Christ of Nazareth proclaimed in Matthew 16:18 -- namely, that not even the gates of hell would prevail against the church of God. Furthermore, Hebrews 12:28 states that God's kingdom is unshakable, while Daniel 2:44 refers to it as indestructible. There can be no doubt that Mormonism contradicts what the Bible says about the perseverance of God's people -- the living church of God. Remember, it was Joseph Smith who attacked Christianity. He said that all their sects were wrong, their creeds an abomination, and their professors corrupt.

Other Doctrines:
1) God the Father is married and there is a Mother God (Answers to Gospel Questions, Joseph Fielding Smith, Vol. 3, pp. 143-144).

2) All men and women who have ever lived on Earth are the spirit offspring of Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. Every person was conceived and born in a pre-existent spiritual realm (Mormon Doctrine, p. 589).

3) Black people are black because of their misdeeds in the pre-existence (Three Degrees of Glory, LDS Apostle Melvin J. Ballard, p. 21).

4) The Bible is considered usable, but suspect due to its many errors and missing parts (Articles of Faith No. 8, Ensign January 1989, pp. 25, 27

Remember that it isn't the Christian church that is attacking Mormonism.  It  is Mormonism that has attacked the Christian church -- believing or stating that true Christianity disappeared from the earth for over 1800 years -- and let's not forget that. Contrary to biblical teachings they also believe in more than one God, that God is a literal man, that men can become gods, that Jesus was the spirit brother of Lucifer, not to mention salvation by works and not by grace (Isa. 43:10; Mark 12:29; John 4:24; John 1:1-14; Gal. 2:14-16; Eph. 2:8,9).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
According to the official story of the LDS Church, in 1820 Smith was visited by God the Father and God the Son after praying about which church he should join. He was told by Jesus, he should join none of them for they were ""all wrong"" and all the Christian church's doctrines ""were an abomination"" (Joseph Smith - History 19, Pearl of Great Price).

DOCTRINES
TRINITY: Mormonism is a polytheistic religion. Joseph Smith declared, ""I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods"" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 370).

Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie spoke about the Godhead in this way, ""Plurality of Gods: Three separate personages: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, comprise the Godhead. As each of these persons is a God, it is evident, from this standpoint alone, that a plurality of Gods exists. To us, speaking in the proper finite sense, these three are the only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to exaltation and are thus gods"" (Mormon Doctrine, pp. 576-577).

GOD THE FATHER: Joseph Smith explained, ""I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see. He was once a man like us; yea, that God himself, the father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ Himself did"" (LDS History of the Church, Vol. 6, p. 305).",1227571200,7,7572,4.874708171206225
447443,5,6302277507,"I watched `The Work and the Glory' several years ago before I started writing reviews and I found it interesting, but somehow disconcerting. Only recently did I stop long enough to rethink my befuddled feelings about this film and came to the conclusion that it was the depiction of Joseph Smith that bothered me. He was too perfect, too angelic to be an honest portrayal of the man. However as I followed that line of thinking further I realized that isn't that what we do with cinematic depictions of Jesus, or any other spiritual teacher or iconic figure (i.e. Gandhi) portrayed on the silver screen? Why should my feelings towards Joseph Smith be any different? Because he was a Mormon that's why!

That was a rather illuminating discovery on my part for I consider myself to be quite open-minded and tolerate in matters of faith and religion. Hence, I decided to watch the film again from a more aware, unbiased vantage point before writing my review. With the second viewing now complete I must say oh what a difference a new perspective makes.

The '04 film `The Work and the Glory' succeeds on every level; complete with gorgeous cinematography, rich, nostalgic soundtrack, well-conceived and scripted storyline with a cast of unknown, but wonderfully talented actors and actresses. The central cast consisting of Eric Johnson, Alexander Carroll and Tiffany Dupont deliver excellent performances that carry the romantic elements of the film from beginning to end. However the heart and soul of the film is the personage of Joseph Smith and the beginning of the Mormon Church. Obviously if he fails to stike a positive cord with the audience the rest of the story crumbles. Fortunately, Jonathan Scarfe is brilliant as the young Joseph; attractive, intelligent, considerate, masculine and ruthlessly unwavering in his personal convictions and belief in his divine vision and mission.

Bottom line, it's a great film! There I said it, I feel better now.",1205020800,36,1959,5.021538461538461

Anyway this guy who portrays Joseph Smith is truly believable as God's Prophet. He is truly the kind of man I would love to sit down and share a beer with and even follow to the Rocky Mountains.

This movie helps you to understand why a few renegade Mormons would even want to get even with a few travelers from the Missouri area coming through Utah's Mountain Meadows. Not the kind of behavior Christians should take part in but people sometimes do carry a grudge, Christian or not, when loved ones have been persecuted and murdered as a matter of political convenience.

Except for the old film BRIGHAM YOUNG, I have never seen a movie about LDS culture and history so true (to my knowledge of it)and in a positive vein as this one, even showing some of the ""worts"".

The story line unraveled slowely, but I see it as setting up the foundation and explanation for the epic to follow.....This is a ""must see"" for all,  LDS people practicing or not should get tears and joy from this film....",1162598400,2,598,4.458715596330276

447481,5,6302277507,"Having seen my fair share of religious-based movies, from thrillers to the downright serious, I wasn't too keen to check out 'The Work & The Glory'.  However, that being said, maybe my expectations were low, consequently as I sat through the movie I was pleasantly surprised at how intelligent and more importantly how well-done the entire production was.  I fully expected this film to *Look* cheaply put together, and it had absolutely nothing that seemed *Cheap* about it.

I steer away from the usual fictional/religious novels that seem to be growing in popularity these days, so I cannot comment on how good/bad the film adaptation was...but what I CAN comment on was how well it all turned out.  The story of the Steed family being caught up in the so-called Mormon Movement that ignited quite a stir in the early part of the 19th Century is one that caught my attention and found to be entertaining from beginning to end.  The family goes through some tough struggles as many families actually did at that time when the religious uprising began in earnest during that same time in the American North East.  Part of the Steed family embraces the message of Joseph Smith, the other part views him first as a kook, and then as a genuine threat to virtually everyone.  The father seems as though during a different time he may have joined the growing flock of Mormons, but in this movie he seems more annoyed at what becomes of his family as they are touched by Smith's message than anything else.  The oldest son is the focal point of much of the growing tension as well as providing the biggest amount of drama the movie experiences.  He chooses a path that will intersect and violently oppose his faith-embracing Mother and siblings.

Are those who oppose Joseph Smith intentionally depicted as dirty and prone to violence in this film?  Probably.  But then again history tends to agree with this portrayal more than than it goes against.  But even so, we MUST remember that above all, this is a FICTIONAL MOVIE and NOT intended to be taken as FACT.  It represents an entirely made-up family and what they go through wrapped up in real events that happened more than a hundred years ago.  Filmmakers have taken liberty of portraying the protagonists in movies as dirty and violent-prone for more than 60 years, so I see no reason why it seems to be a problem here simply because those who oppose it may not be of the LDS faith.  I find it odd that those who vigorously speak out against the faith rent, buy or view Mormon-based films or novels in the first place.  I assure them that there are much better ways to spend their time.  But be that as it may, I found the movie to be MUCH better than I expected, but again, that may be because my expectations were rather low to begin with.

One quick note:  if you are NOT LDS and find yourself frequently engaged in so-called Bible-bashing with Mormons, I would suggest you find something else to rent or buy, because you just aren't going to like this at all.  For those of you who ARE members or you simply wouldn't mind a movie of this particular theme, I wouldn't hesitate picking this up and enjoying it for the fine movie-making it really is.",1151020800,13,3203,4.59402460456942
447482,4,6302277507,"I rate this movie based upon similar films in the overt religious fiction genre.  So, compared with the Book of Mormon movie, Left Behind I, II, III, etc.  The Work and the Glory stands out for having more natural dialogue, and for avoiding the feel of a budget film.

As a propaganda piece, I'm sure the LDS Church was satisfied, though this was not an official production.  Perhaps the most dynamic scene, from this preacher's perspective, is when Joseph explains to young Steed that he was told to join none of the churches.  He then flash backs to a scene where a preacher is explaining the doctrine of predestination, and some members object and walk out.  Apparently Joseph was scandalized by the discord.  The Book of Mormon has even stronger language in this regard.  This film presented the dilemma, but played down the implication--Joseph telling Steed he knows the idea is hard to take.

Odd observations:  Joseph's voice has an odd fullness to it--almost as if the sound folks artificially made it that way.  Additionally, his features were often lighted in a way that seemed a bit much.  Those who followed Joseph, or who at least remained open to him were similarly given an almost angelic look--cleaner clothes, lighter, cleaner skin.  Those who opposed him came to appear rough, unkempt, and darkened.  The problem with such subtleties is that they weren't very subtle.  Another reviewer noted that the good/bad perspective, while effective, was somehow dishonest.  I'm not sure that's reasonable.  This film should be seen as religious fiction--it's meant to have a pro-church message.

Bottom-line:  Catholics and non-LDS Christians will not like this movie.  It's primarily meant to be ""faith-affirming"" for Mormons, and a soft-sell invitation for the curious.  As such it does quite well.  If you're open to Mormon fictional story-telling, this one is probably among the best.  Otherwise, steer clear.",1148860800,2,1921,5.086538461538462

447484,5,6302277507,"The work and the glory movie characterizes a religious people determined to understand intelligently and unbiasedly the testimony of Joseph Smith.  LDS people are some of the most intelligent, talented, and blessed people in the world.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is the America Religion.  This story captures this quality, in a fictional character, who is a descendant of a revolutionary war soldier.  The family has always prized rugged individualism, free choice, and devotion to family and country.  The story beautifully paints love, free choice, sacrifice and commitment, the miracle of faith, the bigotry of ignorance, and the sacrifice required to publish the Book of Mormon.",1132790400,7,703,5.412844036697248
447485,5,6302277507,"The ""Mormon Movie"" genre has had some wide ranging highs and lows. This is definitely one of the highs. For a long time I was skeptical of historical fiction of this type. It was not until I read one of Gerald Lund's other books, the Fire of the Covenant, that I realized the care with which he delineates what is fact and what is fiction. His reponsible approach to the subject matter was impressive.

As a film, this movie succeeds with higher production values and better acting than most Mormon Movies. As a Mormon, it is interesting to see recognizible actors in major roles. For example, Brenda Strong, who plays Mrs. Steed, was Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless wonder, on Seinfeld. Having branched out of the stable of Mormon actors was a real benefit to this movie.

I liked the movie and will add it to my family's collection.",1130025600,4,832,4.577181208053691

447487,5,6302277507,"First, let me say that I'm not LDS (I'm RLDS--those who didn't follow Brigham Young west to Utah after Joseph Smith died), but because of my religious heritage, I'm interested in Mormon history (up to the Nauvoo period). Since my church is too poor to finance film projects, I'm extremely grateful to the LDS Church for their vast resources of money and talent to create films about our shared church history.

I watched this film with a bit of skepticism, as ""The Book of Mormon Movie"", though interesting, faltered on marginal acting, bad dialogue, and cheap looking costumes/sets. However, this film is much better, it was like watching an episode of ""Little House on the Prairie"", which I enjoyed as a kid. The acting was good and not once did I break out of the spell I needed to be in to get wrapped in the story and forget that it's a movie.

The story surrounds the fictional Steed family as they move from Vermont to western New York and start their own farm. The father hires two Smith boys to help his sons settle the land for farming. Word gets round that the Smith boys are nothing but trouble, as the town's riff raff spread rumours about Joseph Smith's claim of angel visitations and Gold Bibles. The younger son Nathan Steed becomes interested in Joseph's testimony, while the older son turns bad boy as he falls under the spell of the malicious Murdock. For increased drama, both Steed sons fall for the storekeeper's daughter, the town's beauty, whose father sends her to Boston for an education, and to save her from the Steed sons.

While Joseph Smith is a supporting character in this movie, I did appreciate seeing his testimony come alive on screen as well as his well known reputation for winning at arm and stick wrestling. Anyone who has participated in Pioneer Day games will be familiar with this part of the story. If the film has any flaws though, I simply didn't find the actor who plays Joseph Smith to be charismatic enough. Forget that he doesn't look anything like Joseph Smith (the actor I believe most resembles Joseph Smith is Clive Owen and he has the charisma to match), but Joseph Smith was well known to be very charismatic. One certainly had to be to create a new religion amid the religious revival that went on in upper New York in the early 1800s.

In this film, we see the creation of the church in 1830, yet we only get a glimpse at a glint of gold peeking out of a bag. We don't see any of the translation process either. Everything is from the Steed family point of view, and that's okay. Maybe a biopic on Joseph Smith will happen someday that will go into more details.

By the time two hours roll by, I didn't want this film to end. I certainly hope they make sequels. I never read the books and probably won't...but I will watch subsequent films, at least through the Nauvoo period. Maybe one of the Steed family will get smart and stick with Emma Smith in the formation of the RLDS Church instead of going west to practice polygamy in Utah territory. But somehow, I doubt it. It's a worthwhile film with high production values. I hope the makers of the ""Book of Mormon"" Movie series are taking notes on how to make a high quality film that fits the era its set in. They have many more chapters to go through, and I'd like to see both series to their ends...but ""The Work and the Glory"" is the far superior film.",1123545600,14,3366,4.484502446982056

He seems like an unhappy, gruff, weak and miserable person.

As for the actor who portrayed Joseph Smith (sorry I can't think of his name) he is by all means my favorite actor EVER to assume the role of Joseph Smith.  Because our prophet dear was that pure, he was that strong, he was that happy, and he was that guileless.  Perfectly cast.
