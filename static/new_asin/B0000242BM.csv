Problem #1, it was advertised as two disks, a DVD and a CD.  The text said it was a DVD and a CD, and the photo showed two disks in the clamshell.  So surprise!  It is just a DVD, in a single disk clamshell.

Problem #2, looking at cover art front and back, it looks like a ""traditional"" production.  It ain't.  It is a messed-up, modernized production.  There is an abundance of 20th or 21st century dress, including construction crewmen wearing jeans and yellow-plastic helmets and wristwatches.  I didn't see any period (16th-century) costumes ... although it looks like one on the album cover, maybe that comes later, who knows?

Problem #3, aside from the modern costumes it is also an ugly modernized set design, the first act being stark red, white, blue, and black.

Problem #4, it is obviously a school or community production.  Not that I mind that under the right circumstances, but the opening choir is weak and anemic;  the first two male soloists are school or community quality;  they are using body mikes, and the second one's body mike is not transmitting very well.

I live in a metropolitan area and if I want to hear a community or school production I can do so easily ... and they are better than this, with all respect.

And where they get off charging $32.76 for this on DVD (not even Blu-ray) ... that is beyond belief.  I really thought I was getting something good for the price.

Yes, I can say something good about it:  the orchestra was good.  But sorry, not recommended.  (I don't know how the Queen sounded, I didn't make it that far.)",1507507200,5,1636,4.477966101694915
