3038861,3,B000Z9J78M,"I just wasn't convinced that my daughter's drivers ed class had covered everything she needed to become a responsible driver. I would drive with her and give her advice, but she would roll her eyes. As usual, she already knows everything I have to tell her. So I bought Driver's Ed To Go - Driver's Ed Made Easy. I thought this video would give her the advice and knowledge she was refusing to take from me. As it turns out, she thinks the video was lame too. It's full of great information, but she didn't want to hear it.

It feels like a video game, so she loves using it, and she's learning whether she likes it or not!",1329436800,2,863,5.595419847328245
3038862,4,B000Z9J78M,"Overall I would say Drivers Ed to go DVD is quite good and provides an entertaining way of learning the basics of driving and road rules. Its set up in a way that you won't get overwhelmed with Information and cut into 2-4 minute skits each with a New lesson leaving room for you to review things you didn't get and going over lessons you feel you need to focus on. I will say though the actors are pretty cheesy,but its set in real LA streets and the car used is modern so it doesnt feel unreal. I have watched several Learning to drive videos and so far this has been one of the best ones and highly reccomend it to all ages especially Young first time drivers
Good luck!",1211241600,8,673,4.184615384615385
3038863,5,B000Z9J78M,I bought this video since my teen is nearing his 16th birthday and he is too embarrassed/lazy to go to real driving school.  It is a very comprehensive DVD that packs alot of learnig into a couple of hours.  It is very entertaining as well as informative.  This is a must have for all those worried parents out there!!!!,1203897600,6,320,4.389830508474576

8235136,1,B000Z9J78M,Total waste of money. It's really dumb and poorly produced. I just donate it to the library. Maybe a very slow learner will get something out of it.,1471564800,,148,4.321428571428571
