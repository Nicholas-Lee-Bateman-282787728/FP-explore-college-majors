8139369,3,B000HEVZTE,"I had read this was a much more accurate  version of the story. I think it was, however it is more like watching a play the end movie. I think it was a bit overpriced.",1481760000,,167,3.7714285714285714
8139370,4,B000HEVZTE,Wife's mothers maiden name is Draper and traces back to the area in Virginia. Interesting.,1448064000,,90,5.066666666666666
8139371,5,B000HEVZTE,"I am a descendant of Mary Draper Ingles and had seen this DVD on the internet earlier, but did not purchase at the time.  Was influenced by one negative review that said something to the effect of ""worse than home movie"".  Although this is not a star studded Hollywood movie, I would found it very good.  Some of the acting may not be the greatest, but overall, I thought it was better than the made for TV movie ""Follow the River"" (which starred Ellen Burstyn as the old Dutch woman).  This movie, ""The Captives"" is much closer to the actual story.  ""Follow the River"" put a false sugar coated ending, which spoiled it for me.
So, better late than never.  I am very glad that I decided to purchase in spite of the one negative review that had stopped me earlier.",1387238400,9,763,4.375886524822695

8139373,5,B000HEVZTE,"I enjoyed this true story that makes history come to life.  This movie brings together authentic mountain music, accurate visual depiction and acting for a memorable look back at a time early in America's history.",1351900800,3,213,5.085714285714285

8139375,1,B000HEVZTE,I enjoyed watching Follow the River and reading the book so I decided to buy this movie.  It is awful.  How in the world did I pay $24 for this on Amazon?  It's like a homemade movie.  Ugh!!! I would give it zero stars if I could.,1301616000,,230,3.8297872340425534
8139376,4,B000HEVZTE,"Beautiful settings, terrible circumstances (understatement) and the will to survive left a legacy to this day. The name Draper is all over the New River Valley because of the perseverance of this one person.  Thanks for bringing this life story alive again!",1243987200,6,257,5.119047619047619
