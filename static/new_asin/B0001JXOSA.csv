8013286,1,B0001JXOSA,Not what I expected.  Not worth the money and it took forever to get here.,1197763200,,74,3.933333333333333
8013287,3,B0001JXOSA,"Hot Women, but just okay movie.  If you mute it out and fast forward to the sex, its pretty good in a mild way.",1182902400,2,111,3.625
8013288,4,B0001JXOSA,"Read David's review for great details (I won't belabor). Here's the skinny:

The production - looks & sounds good, good cam movements, lighting & editing. Scenes tend to drag a bit (but that's why they make fast forward).

The action - from sexy to veeerry hot. Basically a string of soft-core simulated sex scenes strung together by a story as thin and sexy as the babes in the movie. Even w/ the lean plot, still too much bad dialogue! And more variety in the scenes would have helped.

The girls - 3 brunettes and one blonde (& 2 studs if you're counting) - 2 of the brunettes are cute and serviceable. The blonde and the lead brunette (Ander, I believe) are stellar. The pretty blonde has knock-out, busty Cali bod. Ander is cute, lithe and leggy with perfect little champagne glass boobies. Could have had a few more babes in the movie, though.

Pink Factor - mild, not wild. We get a few open leg shots, a landing strip here and there, but not what you really want. Trumps skin-a-max though by having almost wall-to-wall skin.

Bottom line- generally, if you like one Torchlight flick, you'll probably like the others, and vice versa. For what it is, it's pretty good, though.",1148947200,21,1182,4.5829383886255926
8013289,3,B0001JXOSA,"It is very good.  There's no story, but it has pretty women.  It is about eighty percint girl-girl (which is good) but when it ends you're like, ""That's it?""

  Like I said in the title of my essey, It's a good part one of a movie, but it by no means is a whole movie.",1130889600,12,268,3.8
8013290,4,B0001JXOSA,"A Housewife Named Brandi is typical of Torchlight's releases. An almost non-existent story with horrible, pointless dialog ties together several very long sex scenes. The story? Brandi buys a computer. She sets up a website to sell lingerie, where she models the lingerie in front of a webcam. People make fun of her site, so she starts having sex with her female friend and husband in front of the webcam instead. Another guy and two other girls see the site and decide to do the same thing to steal all her business. In the end, the two camps decide to merge. That's it as far as story goes.

There are six sex scenes. Three are boy/girl, two are girl/girl, and one is boy/girl/girl. As expected from Torchlight, the scenes are long, between nine and thirteen minutes. This is good and bad. Most of the time it's good, because all the women in the video are attractive and do a good job during their scenes. The few bad moments occur when the director gets stuck on some shot that isn't particularly hot or interesting and instead of cutting away to something else, it just drags on and on for one or two minutes. But overall, I thought the sex scenes were good. There are four women in the video. Ander Page, April Hannah, Nicole Luv, and Remy. Ander Page is the only one I recognized. She's in three scenes.

Audio and video quality are excellent. There are no extras on the DVD at all.

I liked this DVD and don't regret buying it. But Torchlight stuff is not something I can unconditionally recommend. You are not going to get a story or any dialog that is even remotely interesting, and sex scenes that are going to run three to four times longer than what you'd see in something like a Playboy softcore flick. But for me, the primary reason to watch softcore is for the sex scenes, and this one delivers in that area quite nicely.",1118016000,60,1838,4.480597014925373
