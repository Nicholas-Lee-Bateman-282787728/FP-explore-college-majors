2614574,5,B000GIXCM4,Trilogy of old school horror. outdated today but really fun to watch if you are a true horror fan. Don't you just love slow moving monsters.,1411084800,,140,4.423076923076923
2614575,5,B000GIXCM4,"This is considered by some to be a weak entry in the Blind Dead series, but I personally have no complaints about it.  The decrepit seaside village and atmosphere is superb, and the film captured my attention and I never got bored by it.  There are times when not much is happening because the film doesn't have a high body count, but it's well directed and I wouldn't consider it to be a slow moving film. It doesn't have a lot of gore, but some scenes are kind of violent and the Templar knights look great. There's only a bit of topless nudity, so it isn't recommended if you're just looking for that stuff. You don't have to watch any of these Blind Dead films in order because they are all more like remakes then sequels. This particular entry in the series is loaded with atmosphere, and the entire picture basically takes place in a shabby old fashioned seashore village. The movie has a heavy emphasis on scenery and atmosphere, rather than violence and action. Having the entire film taking place in this one great atmospheric location will be either good or bad depending on your taste in films. The movie deals with the villagers sacrificing members of the village to the Templars by tying them to the rocks near the seashore, in order to avoid an attack from the blind Templar zombies. There's plenty of dismal atmosphere, and you get a good look at the sea and decrepit village throughout the film. The gore scenes are limited, but I thought it was interesting when those crabs are crawling over the sacrificed remains of the victims. After the Templars sacrifice someone, it sometimes shows crabs crawling over their remains. It doesn't explain why that is happening, but I liked it. This film might appeal to some mainstream horror fans, as long as they're avid fans of atmospheric horror. If you love atmosphere, and don't want something that's really fast paced and gory, you might really like it. I personally think it's one of the best Spanish horror films, and it's great to watch late a night.

The DVD quality has grain, but it looks really good overall.",1328486400,8,2076,4.651226158038147
2614576,4,B000GIXCM4,Saw the original and first Tombs Of The Blind Dead series in summer of 72 in the United States and have been a fan of the series.  Just purchased all the movies and if you liked the first you should like all the others.  A little bit campy but....  Still can enjoy and the first still scares me some.,1239235200,,300,4.0508474576271185
2614577,5,B000GIXCM4,"DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE BEFORE WATCHING THE OTHERS FIRST! I FIRST SAW THE ""GHOST GALLION"" & STILL LIKE IT THE BEST, EVEN THOUGH THE MINATURES ARE CRUDE, THE FLESH EATING ZOMBIES(THE TEMPLARS)ARE SCARY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GIRL NEXT TO YOU DIG HER FINGERNAILS INTO YOUR LEG, ARM OR ELSEWHERE & OFCOUSE, THAT'S A GOOD THING!

2614578,4,B000GIXCM4,"The fourth and final installment of writer/director Amando de Ossorio's ""Blind Dead"" films proved the old adage ""if at first you don't succeed..."" to be true. `The Night of the Seagulls', released in '77, was in my estimation by far the best film in the series. The horrific human sacrifice sequence at the beginning immediately captured my attention and held my interest through to the very end. The storyline was simple, straightforward and coherent. The women where also more attractive then they were in the previous installments which never hurts since this genre of film is attracts a predominantly male audience.

Lots of improvements in this one along with that signature sound we've all come to know and love makes for a fitting ending to the ""Blind Dead"". If you only see one in the series make it this one.",1199059200,7,817,4.835714285714285
2614579,3,B000GIXCM4,"1977 saw the last installment of Amando de Ossario's Blind Dead Films. The Night of the Seagulls (aka Terror Beach) was a worthy end for a series that had been going rapidly downhill. Night of the Seagulls is however a vast improvement over the horrid Ghost Galleon.

As always the plot is fairly simple. A doctor and his wife (Victor Petit and Maria Kosty) move to a seaside village. Once there they are given strange warnings by the town's departing doctor and are treated with contempt by the local villagers. It seems that every seven years seven women must be sacrificed to the Knights from the sea in order to keep the town from being destroyed.

Dr. Stein and his wife hire a local girl, Lucy,(Sandra Mozarowsky) to be their servant. One night a neighboring village girl(Julie James) comes to the doctor's door in hysterics before being led off by the local village women in a strange procession. The doctor investigates and learns from the village idiot (Jose Antonio Calvo) about the sacrifices. The next night the villagers come for Lucy and the doctor intervenes and stops the Knights from taking their victim. As usual at this point everything falls apart and the doctor and his wife are attacked by the Knights. The ending has to do with the destruction of the Knights and a pagan idol which controls them.

Once again Blue Underground has done a fine job with the source material. The print quality is basically fine if at times a little soft focus. The audio is standard mono but clarity was good on the English dubbed version. The disc offers the original trailer and a stills gallery.

This is one of the least reviewed entries in the series and probably one of the least seen as well. This is a shame since it is also one of the better entries in the series. The acting is not great and the dialogue runs from the mundane to the just plain awful but the film has a curious ability to keep your attention for its relatively short run time. As with all the titles in this series, you should know what you are in for before spending the money and choose wisely. Well worth a rental for the creepy makeup and costumes. It is also good to see the Knights on horseback again and the riding along the beach scenes provide a iconic image for 70's horror fans.

Rent it.",1184544000,11,2279,4.535279805352798
2614580,5,B000GIXCM4,"The classic saga of The BLIND DEAD ends with this creepy tale of a remote coastal town where frightened villagers must acrifice beautiful virgins to the blood cult of the Knights Templar. For seven nights every seven years, these eyeless zombies rise from the sea to feast on human flesh as the souls of the damned are trapped in the screams of gulls. In this final unforgettable shocker from writer/director Amando de Ossorio, the mood is darker, the fear is stronger and the hunger of the Templar more ferocious than ever before!",1159401600,3,531,4.782608695652174

8133112,5,B000GIXCM4,"NIGHT OF THE SEAGULLS (1975) is the fourth and final installment in Amando de Ossorio's  BLIND DEAD film series. Once again opening w/ a flashback to the days when the Knights Templar were causing trouble while alive, we see them offering another human sacrifice. This time, in far more gory, and brutal fashion than in the previous films. The ""crab"" scene adds a certain gross-out factor! Then, per usual, we are taken to modern times, where Dr. Henry Stein (Victor Petit) and his wife, Joan (Maria Kosty) have just moved to a new town. The townspeople are quite cold to them, and when they get to their new seaside home, the old doctor is ready to leave in a hurry. He warns Stein in a cryptic manner, and takes off. In no time at all, the ancient, skeletal Knights rise from their cold slumber, looking for warm bodies to exsanguinate! Meanwhile, there is a strange ritual taking place. It seems that the townies have brought the old rites of the Templars into the 1970's! The mystery grows, though it's fairly obvious what's going on. SEAGULLS has a definite conspiratorial, Lovecraft feel to it, w/ its cult-ish behavior from just about everyone in town, and the look of the Templar's idol, which is straight out of a Cthulhu book! Due to this, it also has more story / plot to it than the other three films. This movie also has a great finale, that looks like an influence for Rami's EVIL DEAD! Some people hate it, but I think it's the perfect end to the series...",1499126400,3,1471,4.550943396226415

i suspect i be buying that set soon but this price is great and the film is in great, its the last in the blind dead series films and with the lights out and surround sound on the atmosphere of the templers cant be beat, its best siting in dark with big bowl of popcorn sound up high with the templer chants and slow motion ...
