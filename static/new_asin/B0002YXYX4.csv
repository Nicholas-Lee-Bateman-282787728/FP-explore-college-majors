8035048,3,B0002YXYX4,"Actually, the accompanying booklet is just 64 pages, not 72, but that's no big deal because the booklet is very informative with all sorts of helpful information. Here's the big problem tho' -- most folks will probably expect to see a talking head explaining how bar chords are formed and then the usual talking head picking up the guitar and demonstating what to do. This is different. Basically you read the booklet to find out what bar codes and their formation or ""shapes"" are all about and then the 60 minutes of video basically applies what you read in the booklet to the video which first shows ==AT A DVD FIXED TEMPO-- the hand of some guitarist at the top of the screen showing where to place your fingers [as he plays] and this is given twice without the hand playing the chords and then with the top of the screen hand playing the bar chords.

Herein is the problem, the TEMPO of the 'play along' jam video is fixed and can 'not' be slowed down for the person either brand new to bar chords or, indeed, those players getting back into them after a guitar 'vacation' of sorts. In effect, with the tempo already fixed and not being able to be adjusted, by time the learner gets his or her first bar chord shape and fingering into position to play along, the playing 'hand' in the video is already ending the piece perhaps 2 or 3 bar chords ahead of you! As I say, you can't slow down the tempo and, IMO, this is not good because trying to play along with the provided ""jam music"" as the name of the bar chord is flashed on the screen [without the video hand and then with the video hand playing the chord] is simply  too fast! Had the video offered a mouse controlled ""slow down"" mode of the tempo [or indeed as proficiency grew, a mouse controlled ""speed up"" tempo mode], it would have been ideal! But it doesn't. The tempo is unfortunately fixed and apparently makes the assumption that, hey, once you read how the bar chord is fingered and what appropriate ""shape"" is to use it [E, A, etc. shapes] , bang, you should have it [!] and be able to play it and move from bar chord to bar chord in time with the video set tempo! But it doesn't work that way in real life as virtually anyone can recall when they first learned bar chords and the built-in problems of getting bar chords right, making the required pressure on those strings with the ""movable index finger nut"" and then the matter of being able to move everything along the fretboard at something much better than a snail's pace! That takes time and practice to 'move along' and the tempo, at least for those totally new to bar chords, is just too fast.

Now, having said that, the video 'hand' at least 'shows' you where your fingers go and explains the various ""shapes"" in the 64 page manual which in fact is a goldmine of information but playing along with the video can be vexing since the tempo is set in stone, so to speak. Those coming back to bar chords as a 'refresher' may do much better in moving along with the tempo but I seriously doubt that someone new to bar chords could keep up AND produce 'true' bar chord sounds with ALL those 6 strings for the most popular ""root 6 chord shape"" majors on the 6th, as they say, ""thick E string"" and then the A shape [or whatever shape] bar chords on the '5th' root strings using the guitar A string or 5th string as the guide and then partial bars and different fingering for minor bar chords, 7ths, etc., etc. .

One bit of advice and clearly falling within the FWIW [For What It's Worth] department, first and foremost, TAKE YOUR TIME when working with bar chords! On the ""thick 6th string"" and using the E shape where ALL six strings are 'barred' with your index finger, master that first! If, for example, you're just starting out with the popular E-shaped F and G and A bar just to get things going, practice making sure that all the barred 6 strings ring true! Don't fudge on that or else you'll pay the Piper later on! It's really more of an applied pressure on the 'SIDE' of your index finger rather than dead straight on the fretboard because if you use the 'dead straight on' approach to barring, those natural [think the English muffin folks!] ""nooks and crannies"" creases in the fleshy underside of your index finger can and will work against you in terms of obtaining a solid string depression against the fretboard and will practically guarantee 'dead' or 'muted' strings when that is exactly what you DO NOT want in whatever shapes follow the bar as your index finger serves as the now 'movable' nut! Then practice movement on the fretboard keeping in mind that the higher you go up, the 'width' of the fret decreases and you have to mentally adjust for that! Finally, work on speed but 'accurate' speed! Don't count on the heavy use of a mixed-bag special effects box or multi-effects electronic gizmo to cover up botched up bar chords! Believe me, even if you just play for personal pleasure, you will 'hear' the difference if you try to rush it or fudge it! I play both the guitar and the piano but no great shakes to be sure and essentially for personal enjoyment or as some might term it, ""long term hobby playing"", but even alone I can tell readily enough what sounds, shall we say, 'decent' versus what sounds like crap. Take it slow and steady and, in the final analysis, what works for YOU and at 'your' set pace. And progress. Guitar bar chords are challenging and take time and practice to do 'correctly' but keep at it and improvement will come in time. So too, check out YouTube! Lots of bar chord tips there to be had for free! Finally this: Don't doom yourself to the first 3 or 4 frets of the guitar fretboard and those fixed open chords a la mode. Bar chords open up a whole new world of playing and an understanding of the fretboard itself for such ""movable chords"" can be a tremendous asset not to mention branching out further beginning with simple guitar leads and then progressing to more complicated or ""fancy"" ones. Can you tell me 'honestly' that you 'never' heard a guitar piece you 'really' liked, I mean 'really' liked, and after making sure no-one is around, did you not make with the so-called ""air guitar"" thing and make like 'you' were producing those neat sounds? Fess up! Hey, on some of them, anyway, and popular bar chords therein, you 'can' do just that on a real guitar versus 'air' ... IF you make the effort to learn it and practice it enough times.  Enjoy!
