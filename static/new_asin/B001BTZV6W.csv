8284880,1,B001BTZV6W,I picked this up at my local library while on the hunt for techniques to help with natural childbirth preparation. It begins with a creepy black and white birth scene that scared my toddler. It doesn't get better from there. There are no words throughout the DVD. It felt like a horror flick.,1384128000,,292,4.528301886792453
8284881,5,B001BTZV6W,"Leboyer is so subtle. What he has found and teaches is still so radical it might be hard for us to see and hear. We expect something completely different; instruction, guidelines, graphic hospital scenes. What he wants us to see is the miracle of a child being born. His first book created such a stir. He was accused of risking the newborn's life  What he showed was  the simple fact that we need not rush.  We can let birth unfold and not,by often unnecessary procedures. aggravate the baby's shock of coming into this world.  Naturally,  provided conditions are normal. He  does  not propagate risk taking.  With this film he shows clearly, what science later has proved, that the new born sees,hears and feels.

Today  courses in baby massage abound . Again Leboyer was the first to introduce baby massage in the Western world. This second film shows a young Indian mother going through an old traditional form of infant massage. With expert loving touch she communicates  with  her son.

 Last but not least, the third film  introduces chanting in child birth preparation and labor. What could be more
radical? This is not a hippie movie  or 70's movie, as one reviewer calls it. No cannabis involved - no offence meant.  I am an admirer of Ina May Gaskin and all the other wise midwives. But this film raises birthing to a  different level.  It uses water, flood  and storm as a metaphor for the process of birthing and labour. Leboyer encourages women not to be afraid. To set aside preconceived ideas of what labour is. The film is a celebration of Womanhood. But sadly few of us are able to listen.

8284882,1,B001BTZV6W,"The first film is not about the birthing process.  The film starts with the baby's head already emerged from it's mother and a pair of hands pulls baby out and places it on its mother's belly.  No narration or talking as the baby lies there on it's mother's belly.
The second film is a woman massaging her baby.  No narration or speaking.
The third film is a woman playing a sitar and singing/chanting. No breathing instruction, narration, or speaking",1252713600,8,451,4.6835443037974684
8284883,4,B001BTZV6W,"What is beautiful about LeBoyer, is not the his association with indian culture and teaching it to white women, but the awareness of the beauty and naturalness of child birth. Let's remember that this was introduced in the 70s in the west, when births in the hospital was at it's highest. And it is getting to that point again. What LeBoyer does it bring our awareness back to the health of the child, the mother, the journey of birth and what it can be, rather than this ""illness"" that the west has forced upon us.
Look at this as a poem celebrating life and not a literal training course.",1239840000,7,590,4.422018348623853
8284884,2,B001BTZV6W,"Out of all the great stuff out there for doulas & midwives, this isn't one of them.  It's just odd.  So 70's.  Natural childbirth should be ""natural"" - teaching white women to make noises like they are from the Indian culture is not natural.  I recommend any of Ina Mae Gaskins works or Penny Simkins stuff leagues above this.  I know some people will disagree - fine - to each her own.",1234396800,4,386,4.305555555555555
