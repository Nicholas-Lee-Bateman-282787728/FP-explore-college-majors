1085997,1,6305909431,"This story was originally a short story by Isaac Asimov that was critically acclaimed.  It was next expanded into a novel that received mixed reviews.  It has now further deteriorated into a dreadful film.
This film was far below B movie standards.  Every element of it was poorly done.  I've seen better acting in high school assembly halls.  The screenplay was horrible with dialogue so bad it could make you retch.  The music was shrill and the sound quality poor.  The special effects were below 1960's standards.  Even the editing was poor.  The whole film was simply pathetic.
Asimov's original theme of the battle between science and religion was almost completely lost in an attempt to make the story into a ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" adventure.  The explanation of why darkness fell on the planet centered on the eclipse of one sun, but failed to explain what happened to the other five.
This film was abysmal.  I rated it a 2/10.  Stay away.",970358400,7,950,4.725609756097561
1085998,1,6305909431,"I have been a fan of the works of isaac asimov for like ten years and  when i first read nightfall i thought that it would have made an excellent  movie  i was  very happy  after hearing that two  asimov novels were making  their way to the big screen. and was very pleased with Bicentenial Man even  though it was advertised as  a comedy and it was not.  But this was simply  terrible  why did they even atatch isaac's name to it  if they were not  even going to follow the story of the book? the introduction of  the mental  abilitys, the  lack of coheirant exposition and the cutting off of the end  of the story were almost as bad as the writing,  acting  and special  affects. this story diserves to be done right and mr corman if you still  have the rights  turn them over to some one who will. this was beond what i  would have concidered a bad interpitation. all the good bits of the story  were thrown out for the forbidon love  and  unnecacery special effects. do  not buy this  movie unless you want examples of how not to tell a classic  science fiction story",967507200,3,1071,4.236180904522613
1085999,1,6305909431,"Where to begin?  Should I start with the part about how there is almost no relationship between this movie and one of Asimov's finest stories?  Should  I mention that the acting was terrible?  Or should I just rag on the cheesy  special effects which made it impossible to focus on what pathetic vestige  of a plot they bothered to offer us.  Dried paint (bright red, not dirty  red) on swords to signify blood of someone run through with the sword only  moments before.  Flame effects that--oh, what's the point? I could go on  and on, since nearly every minute of the movie was painful and deserves  criticism.  Ignore Asimov's name associated with this movie.  Read the  short story, or better yet the novel that he co-wrote with Silverberg.  Or  get the Audiobook.  But do not see this movie under any circumstances.
By  the way, I agree with the other commentor who said you need to expand to a  ""zero stars"" rating for movies like this.  It's pushing it to  give this movie a star.",967420800,4,987,4.551724137931035
1086000,1,6305909431,"Rent this only if you and your friends like to play ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and make fun of really bad movies!  This is the most  amateurish film I have ever seen.  Apparently filmed in India, it features  red paint put onto the swords with a brush to simulate blood.  Giant  unrealistic flames burn in a model village worthy of a scene from a  Godzilla epic.  Look closely at the end when a bad guy is burning to death  and you can see his protective helmet!  Only a crowd of folks with a good  sense of humor and possibly a six-pack or a bottle of wine can make this  movie bearable.  It is an insult to Isaac Asimov's story.
Aside to  AMAZON.COM:  You need to allow a rating of ZERO stars!",966211200,3,699,4.229007633587786
1086101,1,6305909431,"Not being a person given to suffering depression, I thought I would be safe watching this movie. As the movie droned on, I seriously began to consider slitting my wrists to escape the horror of this film. At the time death seemed preferable to the continuing torture I was being subjected to. Even now, years later, I want to stab my eyes out just thinking about it.

For God's sake save your money and your sanity and do not watch this movie, and by all means shield your children from it.",1239408000,2,490,4.384615384615385
1086102,2,6305909431,"Probably the only difference from the average review here is that mine gives an extra star. I've not read Nightfall but I have read a couple of Asimov's Foundation books (Prelude to Foundation twice). I wanted to see if there were any movies out there of his work. Nightfall was the only one I found so far, so I wanted to check it out...

Well, aside from cute Jennifer Burns and finding a few Space-y shots intriguing (for my 2nd star), I'm convinced it doesn't do the book justice---or rather it ruins it. Right away I thought, 'Serious? Low-budget, crappy, acting?, weak, 2000?...etc.' I thought part of it was made in 1970's. Really unfortunate I say. I wonder if they actually collaborated with the man for input or simply went from the book and applied their subpar film skills for such a work.

I hope better Asimov films rise from truly talented filmmakers. I'm hoping for Prelude to Foundation 'cuz it's my favorite. And the actress shouldn't just be cute (sorry Jen), but cute AND a great actor.",1199750400,,1006,4.646067415730337
1086103,1,6305909431,"When I first read Isaac Asimov's short story ""Nightfall"", I was stunned and left gasping at its powerhouse of a closing. When I finished watching the filmed version, I was also stunned and left gasping--but for quite different reasons. All the mystery and beauty of the short story that sought to explain a millenia old phenomenon of a planet's first and last nightfall was not only lost in the movie, but even on a technical level of competence, from the wretched directing of Paul Mayersberg to the incompetent acting of David Birney and David Carradine, this movie quite unintentionally presents both a challenge and a dilemma to those whose job it is to pass judgment on its merits. For truly abysmal efforts like ROBOT MONSTER or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, these efforts nevertheless retain the saving grace of something that clicks with the audience, whether that something be the excessive exuberance of John Barrows waving his arms in a gorilla suit from ROBOT MONSTER or the perversely androgynous heavy-handedness of director Ed Wood in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Even 'bad' movies can have a style of their own that comes into play usually late at night in a marijuana filled college recreation room. But what separates the fun of enjoyable bad movies from the torture of having to sit through garbage like NIGHTFALL is the deadening seriousness of the collective hands of all concerned from director to writer to actor. In such movies as this, there is nowhere to be found any lightness of attitude or just plain old fun. It is as if such films serve only to remind the audience that there are indeed moments in our lives that call for infinite patience while someone drives sharp needles under our fingernails. Yet, I do not want to have to pay for such dubious pleasure. With films like this one, I did.",1023580800,27,1813,4.758730158730159
1086104,1,6305909431,"Why was this movie even made? This is the type of movie that Holywood producers see and think ""Well, if it was written as a book first, we might as well throw away the script now."" It gives a bad name to movies based on books.

I have never read the original book, Nightfall, and have hardly touched any of Asimov's works, but this movie makes me want to keep away from any books by the ""Renowned"" and ""Award Winning"" author.

The movie was obviously filmed in India and uses locals as extras. The only people with lines are Caucasian except for the two ""villains"" who spend more time making faces while speaking than they do making any sense of the lines they have been fed. David Caridine has never been a good actor. The ""Kung Fu"" series I consider a pathetic excuse for a joke. The only good thing about this movie is the art on the DVD/VHS cover.

The leads are two caucasian women in mid-eighties clothing with bulky purses that contain laser-pistols. They use a modern telescopic camera lens on an antique telescope found in a cave; that would be laughable if they bothered to take a moment to exploit it a bit. Good or bad, not one person in this film is even slightly attractive. Whatever the producers of this film were thinking when they made it, or whatever they were on, it was really a huge waste of time and money.

Don't waste your money on this...

UPDATE!

I read the short story by Isaac Asimov and watched the movie one more time... Suffice it to say, my first impressions were correct.

In the original story, the people are on a planet that is surrounded by three suns and once every 3000 years there is a nightfall. The people are terrified of the dark and cannot even stand to pass through a dark tunnel for five minutes before going insane.

The casting, as I mentioned before, is horrible. The acting is... well... there's not much here to mention.

The movie tore apart what Isaac Asimov wrote (a suspensful thriller of a tale) and made it into a crappy wanna-be action flick that is about as fun as watching a toilet spin the dirty water down the hole in the bottom.

My apologies to those who have seen this movie, even though I had nothing to do with the creation of it.

My warning to all who hold a mild curiosity for this film. You may just find yourself agreeing with me if you take the risk and try to watch it...",1015891200,13,2348,4.362385321100917
1086105,1,6305909431,"There are so many complaints for this film that it would take too much time to enumerate.  On a world with 6 stars and constant light, the entire planet is of a middle-eastern/Indian skin tone, except for our handful of protagonists, who are surprisingly caucasian.  The societal conventions, including such things as dress and makeup are also uninspiringly late 20th century American, down to lipstick and pony tails.  Our heroes use camping lanterns to explore caverns yet whip out laser pistols to fight off sword-wielding attackers.
Robe-wearing religious fanatics are our antagonists, and seeing a similarly clad David Carradine confronting them makes one expect to see a sudden kung fu showdown, and a Japanese anime-style soundtrack clashes horribly with all too 'Roger Corman' plain cinematics.

1086107,1,6305909431,"I rate this as 1 star because there appears to be no option for ZERO which is what it is really worth. I can't believe that Isaac allowed his name to be associated with such a corruption of his brilliant original short story. Its this kind of rubbish that gives SciFi a bad name! Come on you Hollywood scriptwriters, how about an Elijah Baley movie such as ""The Caves of Steel"" or ""The Naked Sun"", and stick closely to Asimovs story line this time.",987984000,6,448,4.345238095238095
1086108,1,6305909431,"I was a big Asimov fan and made the mistake of seeing this film when it came out in the cinema, since it was the first movie made from an Asimov idea since ""Fantasic Voyage""  YUCK!  Over half the audience LEFT the movie and by the time it was over I wished I had, too.
This movie has nearly NOTHING to do with the original novella and undoubtedly was the major reason that no other works of Asimov have been adapted to film (even though they are among the most deserving to be adapted)
I continuously wondered throughout the film what major chemicals the cast and crew were consuming throughout the production.  The acting, the cast and the production values are among the worst I have ever seen outside of old 8mm student films with budgets of less...  I think we have a film here that can easily displace ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" as the worst movie of all time.
Please boycott this film.",982281600,14,890,4.375757575757576
1086109,1,6305909431,"Okay, okay, this movie was as rotten as a reeking week old carcass under the blazing sun.  I can lament for hours about the MANY horribly done 'effects' and the fact that it did not match the original tale, clinging only to several very BASE-ic threads to what was an Asimov Masterpiece.  I could also go on and on about how this horrific movie was cast with what I would think are the dregs of the Screen Actor's Guild (if not just ordinary passers-by abducted off the streets of Calcutta and forced to perform in this heinous waste of celluloid under the threat of their demise) -- but I can only say this... As horrid as it was... as tasteless, and wasteful of cash and human life-moments as this travesty of film has been, it is not half as horrid as its 1988 predecessor.  *That* movie was some product of a bodily function from a mushroom-dazed idiot, and like some movies & games have been known to induce epileptic fits, this movie nearly caused me catatonia.  Anyway... this movie bites the big one, but if you enjoy MST3K as a show, and like to do as they did... it's the perfect candidate for such activities.  For anyone who enjoys Sci-fi, and is looking for good entertainment, find the book by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg, and read that... These film adaptations of the story (probably spawned from some evil parallel universe) should be shot into the sun.",976924800,10,1377,4.558704453441296
1086110,1,6305909431,"This movie is bad.  Very bad.  Extraordinarily bad.
To put it in perspective, a group of devoted movie fans who once cheerfully watched a double feature of Robot Jox and Teenage Mutant Turtles II -- in short, a group of people with no discernible standards whatsoever -- this group of people voted to turn this film off after a mere 30 minutes of viewing.
The sole good thing I can say about this movie is that it shares a title and a basic idea in common with a story by Isaac Asimov.  Other than that, the effects, acting, storyline, production values, dialogue, art, locations, and direction are all either completely non-descript or outright lame.
To be fair it should be noted that the one person who voted in favor of continuing to watch this film was also the one person who had never read the Asimov story.  If you fit into this category, it may be possible for you to grit your teeth and sit through the whole thing.  I can't think of a single reason to, though.",974419200,5,971,4.432584269662922

The movie doesn't follow the book too well (what's new?) but it's fun to watch anyway. Other reviewers have pointed out a number of ""errors,"" so I won't repeat them.

7897319,3,6305909431,"Aeon is a planet with 6 suns and it is never dark...except for that one time. It seems every 1,000 years it goes pitch black and everyone panics. The film is designed to show the rift between science and religion as far as prophecy and causation. Some of societies' superstitions and religious beliefs have a basis in fact. In this regard, the basic theme of the story comes through. In this film a woman scientist teams up with a religious ""Watcher"" as a minor ""Romeo and Juliet"" type romance.

The problem I had was the characters. The planet had a Casablanca setting with people of various accents and complexion. I would think everyone would be dark skinned, but hey, that's just some crazy idea I have on sunlight and its effect on the flesh. What exactly does the phrase ""Meet you tomorrow morning"" mean on a planet with no nightfall? The characters didn't excite me.

I believe this film could be remade, or better yet, inspire a new modern script purists would hate, but one that would be reflective of today's world.",1420761600,2,1025,4.626373626373627

I have several feet of bookshelf dedicated to Asimov so I felt obligated to purchase it. And Nightfall is considered by many the greatest short SF story ever written. All I can say is that this was a injustice to a great story.

I have to comment on one reviewer claiming this was the worst movie ever made. I believe that distinction goes to Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""",1309564800,4,469,4.153846153846154

I love Asimov and feel Nightfall is one of the best short stories ever written.  You cannot imagine how horribly disappointed I was after viewing this movie.  High schoolers with a hand held video camera and no script could have done a better job.  If I could have given it NO STARS, I would have but I had to give it at least one or rather a negative number.

If you haven't read the story, please, do yourself a favor, do so.  The only thing this movie has to do with Asimov's story is the title.  In fact, if you weren't familiar with the short story, you'd have no idea what this movie was actually about.  I'm sure the people making it didn't.  There is so much wonder, mystery and awe in the short story that it seems inconceivable that the people making this movie couldn't have found even a hint of it.  However, there is nothing in this movie that appealing in any way.  They not only didn't follow Asimov's story, but also choose the add things that never should have even been considered. Did they think they cold improve that was pretty close to perfect??

I pray for the day (and I'm not religious person) that someone in Hollywood (or wherever) will make a movie worthy of Asimov's masterpiece.

7897325,1,6305909431,"It's been a long time since I've read the novella, but I just read the book based off it by Asimov and Silverberg.  While reading it I kept thinking it would make a great movie.  There were so many scenes that would translate so well to film, such as cowering under the black sky full of stars and the rioting and burning.  So much good stuff.  So I was excited to find a movie of it.  I'd never heard of it before, so I knew it had to be low-budget but look at the source material.

What the hell?  How can someone take anything written by Asimov and turn it into that?  I was expecting fewer characters than the book, but what's up with the added Gary Stu with fabulous magical powers?  The low budget and bad acting would be forgivable if it was something more like the book or story.  But why add someone with magical powers that do not belong in this universe?  He's the kind of thing that I imagined into stories when I was six.

Other than that, it was released in 2000 but has a distinct 1970's SF movie feel that was a little disquieting.  And the mob of crazed maniacs milling around to set things on fire made me laugh.  And...  This movie has no redeeming qualities.",1267315200,,1178,4.219730941704036
