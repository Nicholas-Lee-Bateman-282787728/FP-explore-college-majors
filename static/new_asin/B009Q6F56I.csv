5360829,3,B009Q6F56I,"This is volume 2 but not the last episode. I'm not sure how far this series goes out, but I may not be willing to see it to the end if it's not wrapped up by the next disk. This is a very slow moving story despite the sci-fi/murder mystery/action genres that it falls into. Remember Ghost in the Shell? It's like that. A little action here and there with mostly boring filler trying to set a mood or delving into morality issues. I was intrigued at the beginning, but the story is dragging out too slowly for me. If you have the interest, patience, and money to shell out for this series, go for it.",1363564800,,599,4.172413793103448
5360830,5,B009Q6F56I,"Great animation, little less action than the firts in the series. No complaints here, cant wait for the last in the series.
Recommended.",1363392000,,136,4.956521739130435
5360831,5,B009Q6F56I,"This series is strangely involving and compelling. The contrast of the heroine's innocence pitted against the forces opposing her make for tense story telling. Her nudity during her recovery procedures is not in the least salacious, but fits with both the technical procedures in the story and her psychological/spiritual struggle and growth. There is also a strong element of love coming from the enlightened beings helping her and also of pure platonic love between the heroine and the ""being"" assigned to protect her. Interesting and satisfying. Can't wait for the third production.",1360972800,,585,5.369565217391305
5360832,5,B009Q6F56I,"Just finished watching this film. Abdolutely loved it as with the first installment. The second installment is focused in two halves, the first runes recovery within a place known as ""paradise"" with the brief ebcounter of another nut-nut assassin with a penchant for limb cutting. The second half all takes place on a casino. Whe I saw the trailer I had no idea why a casino would play such a large role in the story, (having not read the mang) but, no spoilers, now I see and it was a great way to finish off the film. Coming to that, it ends very VERY abruptly with a simple sentence leaving you wondering just what's going to happen next. Thoroughly enjoyable mature watching and I really can't way for last installment.",1357948800,2,723,4.569230769230769
5360833,4,B009Q6F56I,"I just finished watching The Second Combustion and I was soo happy when i could see the continuation to one of my fave mangas turned anime. It picks up exactly where the 1st film left off and it does for the most part follow the manga almost 100% A few things were left out, like the gambling lessons and how to play the games, but to me that was a good thing. I found that to be very dull in the manga and also they added nudity in this anime as well, as they did in the First Combustion. The manga has no nudity at all, and Balot looks a little different but anyways, back to this work. The story seems to run rather short and kinda ends abruptly, like the first film.

  I know this series has maybe 1 maybe 2 more films to finish the story and I wish they wouldn't take so damn long to make it but I did think that both films are good, so its worth the wait. I'm just not very patient so I would like to see the next film soon and also wish the next volume of the manga would drop already. It is odd that they mention a lot of egg jokes in this series. (Dr. Easter, Boiled, Shell...etc.) I guess its an inside joke somewhere but i don't  understand it. Overall, if you enjoy the manga i recommend you watch this, and if you enjoy this anime, watch the First Compression if you haven't and I highly recommend the manga to you as well.. ENJOY!",1357257600,3,1345,4.045112781954887
5360834,3,B009Q6F56I,"It was expected the second ""act"" would be a time to recover oneself,heal and plot the next moves. There was little expectation for intense action,certainly not at the level of the first volume. A time to tie up loss ends,deepen the level of explainations,etc. We get all of that. Balot's nudity,quite the shocker in volume one because of her age,is in this volume,thankfully mostly limited to skinny dipping with a partially mechanized(?) porpoise...a male, self-proclaiming at every turn, a homosexual and the lover of the teen-aged boy that met Balot as she awoke after her arrival at ""Paradise"", the secure location for her recovery. This and this alone accounts for my low score.
The boy has little of real substance to offer and only really serves as another blot typically placed on any modern storyline by those that insist the homosexual agenda is forced into everything; this intrusion has,once again had the effect of a self-centered jerk taking a dump in the punch bowl at a party just for attention. This is by no means,the only example of this outrage but as there is/was no purpose in inserting this trash into this storyline other than the artistic/writing staff to get,perhaps,an approving nod from an activist at some wine-and-cheese,or worse,future gathering. Perhaps,even,the artistic staff is gay themselves and cannot sell their ""act"" otherwise. Who knows?
What is sure is that this is such an outrage that it will be quite sometime before I continue paying such high prices just to finance the propaganda of narcissits.
The storyline otherwise is the expected 4 1/2 Star,5 perhaps. Balot begins to take charge of her life and becomes quite the intelligent and scrappy fighter. I wished they would have had her 16th birthday already. We have had the intended shock of a naked 15 year old and is time to move on.",1356566400,2,1832,4.951298701298701
5360835,2,B009Q6F56I,"Mardock Scamble The Second Combustion is definitely not a movie to watch a second time, UNLESS you're doing a movie marathon of the movie series. I wanted to know what happened after the first movie, but, NOTHING HAPPENS HERE!!! It felt like a boring one hour episode. The first movie was far more violent, had a compelling setting and lasted 125 minutes, while its sequel only lasted 61 minutes. With the way this film ended, I'm hoping the final movie will be extremely entertaining and psycho-like as the first movie when it comes to DVD in America. This should have been longer.

Edit: Sentai Filmworks seriously needs to stop using anime openings as ""special features"", and actually have SPECIAL FEATURES! This is why FUNimation is the most reliable anime distributor in America.",1351555200,,784,4.9393939393939394

8543695,5,B009Q6F56I,"Wow, what a way to pick up the action.  I own the first volume and I enjoyed it.  This one picks up and continues the story along.  No spoilers from me, but if you like heavy action and good drama then I'd say get this one.",1383782400,,223,3.8043478260869565
8543696,3,B009Q6F56I,"After watching the episode First Compression I thought this series would be promising.
After watching Second Combustion I feel disappointed.  The story seems to lose focus and pace,
with some obvious filler story lines enhanced by sparkling animation.  Although it may aspire to be,
this is definitely not on the same level as Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex.  Considering
the price, I doubt very much I will bother with the 3rd episode if there is a domestic US release.",1382659200,,479,4.888888888888889

8543699,5,B009Q6F56I,"I just finished reading the book(translated by Viz), which is over 700 pages long and I can tell you that the primary Amazon Editorial Review has totally missed the mark on this one. I have also seen both of the Mardock Scramble disks sold by Amazon. I feel it behooves me to review some of the material that is in the book which either did not make it into the videos, or were so glossed over that people do not know what they are looking at.  As such, the rest of this going to be in the vein of spoilers, but they are important so you know what you are looking at. I will avoid telling about anything that will be in the third video.

Spoilers Start Here:

There was a really big war where the army engaged scientists to do human experimentation to make better soldiers. The center of this experimentation was a place called Paradise. There were three main scientist leaders for Paradise. After the war, the countries repudiated Paradise and the leaders would have been executed, but each chose a different path to make themselves acceptable to society. One started the Scramble 09 protocol to solve criminal cases to show their usefulness. One started the October Corporation, to provide amusement & pleasure to the populace. The third isolated himself in Paradise (the head in the birdcage). The October Corporation killed the head of the Scramble 09 group, leaving Dr. Easter.

In the first Mardock Scramble, we meet two creations of this mess, Shell & Boiled. Rune is killed? and brought back by Dr. Easter. The stories in this series are a journey of how a severely damaged young girl is empowered to strike back and how she is repaired psychologically.  There are multiple sets of bad guys that need to be brought down, including striking at the October Corp.

The primary reviewer states that the plot in Second Combustion doesn't go much of anywhere -- or make much sense, when in actuality what is happening is that it is giving you the back story of the three Paradise scientists. The casino is important since the heroes need to get their hands on the Million Dollar Poker chips that store Shell's memories.  Can they do it? Will Shell marry into the October Corp and become a member of their ruling elite?

If the video producers handle it right the end of series (video 3) should have fight scenes in it that are epic. The name of the third section in the book is ""The Third Exhaust"".  Keep an eye out for it. I am looking forward to it.",1370044800,2,2453,4.556818181818182
8543700,5,B009Q6F56I,Just watching the being sequence you feel that it is a little different. Would not recommend for kids since there is nudity. But love how  they mix tech into the lives of the character. Sometimes leaves you guessing a little of where this is heading.,1368057600,,250,4.555555555555555
8543701,4,B009Q6F56I,"part two of the series, I liked part one enough to purchase part two an watch it. Very serious subject matter, not for kids.",1367280000,,124,4.208333333333333
