I had someone correct me in public because I was using the wrong sign for ""Kiss."" I looked it up and found a few other words not correct on the DVD. Spend a little more and get someting else.",1315872000,,357,3.710526315789474
8681214,5,B001CEK0N0,I've watched the DVD from beginning to end with little ones and they seem to really enjoy learning an additional way to communicate.  BabyFirstTV's I Can Sign dvd has become an educational tool that we look forward to using in order to help foster interaction and learning.,1219708800,,273,4.808510638297872
