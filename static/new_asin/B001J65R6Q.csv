3652462,4,B001J65R6Q,"This one DVD has 5 different workouts on it.  I already had a couple of them, but it's handy to have them all together.  They are all well done and motivating.  It is a beginner-level production, but gets into some kind of energetic movement, and it might be best to sit and watch the whole thing first, before actually doing the workouts - you can eat ice cream while watching, you'll burn it off after you start faithfully doing Pilates every day.  I'm an old lady, and I do it!
The ladies are attractive and make you feel you can achieve what they have by following along.  To a great extent, it's true.  You just have to become a Pilates addict, which is not too hard.",1243123200,20,672,4.2936507936507935

3652467,4,B001J65R6Q,"I have had this DVD for awhile now and Ms. Caban is probably one of the better instructors.  I got the DVD from Target, but I am learning that workout DVDs are much cheaper on Amazon.  At first I was not to keen on her voice, but her instructions and method are probably one of the best in making sure that you do the exercises correctly.  The only work out that sort of throws me off is Day 4.  The very first/last workout is good when I have to get back to a workout routine and workouts 2 and 3 are workouts are good for when I have extra time to get ready for work or if I actually wake up when my alarm goes off.",1359849600,,617,3.873015873015873
3652468,3,B001J65R6Q,"Like other reviewers, I was thrown off by the workouts not lining up with the back of the case.
I worked through them and figured out the correct order. If you didn't see the review with the order it goes like this:

1) AM Pilates with Jillian Hessel
2) PM Pilates with Ana Caban
3) Pilates for Weight Loss Maintenance with Ana Caban
4) Cardio Pilates with Ana Caban
5) Easy Pilates with Ana Caban

Overall I find the workout challenging. This is my first attempt at Pilates, and I hope that I will eventually be flexable to do all the moves in the work out. I'm on my second week doing the dvd and I feel like I'm getting a grasp on the workouts an am motivated to improve. This is a great workout and with the longest one being 30 minutes is an additional bonus to me.",1346716800,4,770,4.1610738255033555
3652469,3,B001J65R6Q,"wish I had seen these reviews before I had bought this someplace else, at first I kind of was angry that I got this and thought it might just sit on my shelf, but I have been trying to alternate this with my other video and it's starting to grow on me. It is annoying that the DVD sequence on the back and the times are mismatched, but the quality is pretty good. the 10 minute routine is a nice easy warm up. I tried that in conjunction with one of the other routines and it made it easier - so it's great to stretch with that.  The other routines other than PM, seem a bit too challenging, but I'm hoping as I get better and more flexible they'll be easier. Nice to have something to grow with a bit, and some quick routines for variety. But right now, I have to rate it 3 stars since I haven't been able to fully utilize this - plus I agree with others - the title is a bit misleading.",1343952000,,888,3.9887640449438204
3652470,5,B001J65R6Q,This DVD Pilates teacher was recommended by my awesome Pilates instructor and the DVD given to my son's girlfriend. The two of us took a mat class together at the same facility where I take individual lessons for physical therapy due to an injury. She and I loved the class and this was one of the recommended home use videos! Get moving and enjoy life!,1326672000,,353,4.446153846153846
3652471,2,B001J65R6Q,"This presents of good variety of short workouts. Unfortunately, Ana Caban, who presents 4 of the 5 options, does a massively annoying voice over, really one of the most irritating I've heard. Only for those days when I feel like I can stand to listen to her!",1325462400,,258,4.51063829787234
3652472,4,B001J65R6Q,"I had bought one from this series before so I knew what I was expecting. One of the sets however is a repeat from the first dvd I bought called Pilates Tone and Burn Collection. So I had a double up, which is a bit of a bummer but that aside these work outs are real good. You will need a stretchy band (used in pilates) for one of the sets also but its not necessary. I also thought, going by the title, that this would contain a workout for each day , like at consistant level. It does have workouts but they are more random, some easier than others. I would definately recommend buying this though. It has got a good range of workouts which is good if your a beginner. Also Ana Cabain is a fantastic instructor who has a sense of humour which is a must in my opinion.",1316995200,,770,4.072368421052632
3652473,5,B001J65R6Q,"I got hooked on pilates with Ana's Core Pilates DVD. This DVD was a nice addition to my workout collection. The workouts are challenging enough for me, but not too much so. I feel that my muscles are toned well using these workouts. Ana is a fun instructor; she seems spunky and fun; it motivates me just watching her videos!!",1316649600,,326,4.45
3652474,4,B001J65R6Q,This DVD offers a well rounded variety of workouts for someone who wants a little extra to add to their fitness rountine.  The level is intermediate but it can be done by a beginner who wants to improve core strength.,1297296000,4,217,4.425
3652475,1,B001J65R6Q,Not a bad workout but the instructor talks the whole time and it is pretty annoying.  This was the first and last time I will use this DVD.,1296259200,,139,3.9642857142857144
3652476,4,B001J65R6Q,"I enjoyed this series of pilates workouts. The outdoor settings were great and the instructors, Ana Caban and Jillian Hessel, clearly knew what they were doing. The odd the was the difference in difficulty. I didn't even break a sweat during Easy Pilates, but I was completely floored by Pilates Maintenance for Weight Loss, even without the push-up sequence (I have a bad wrist). These workouts were also released separately, so if you have more than one of them, this isn't worth it, but otherwise it's a good addition to your repetoire. Note: In AM Pilates, the instructor uses an exercise band, but this is not absolutely necessary.",1291507200,3,636,4.898148148148148
3652477,3,B001J65R6Q,"I am quite new to pilates but have done ballet for many years. This DVD is a little strange in that the level doesn't seem too advanced (aside from one or two moves) but there is very little instruction on how to do the moves. Ana and Jillian are shown doing the routine with a voice over that doesn't give much guidance on correct positioning or breathing.

I was also as confused as everyone else about the random order of the workouts compared to the list on the back of the DVD. Also, why wouldn't they start with something easy and build up? It would make much more sense to have one introduction workout first which explains some of the moves.

That being said, I like that there are a variety of workouts. However, they are all fairly short so you may have to do two in a row to get a real workout.",1288051200,2,805,4.220779220779221
3652478,4,B001J65R6Q,I wanted to add to my collection so ordered this one. It came quickly and at a great price. It was an original unopened product.,1283126400,2,128,4.16
3652479,1,B001J65R6Q,"I love doing pilates, but I did not love this DVD. My main problem with the DVD is that the numbers for the workouts do not match the guide on the back of the DVD. Therefore, I had to watch each workout and the time for each workout to figure out which one was which. On top of this, the time for each workout does not match what the back cover of the DVD says. For example, if the back cover says a workout segment is 27 minutes, it is probably about 20 minutes. I am familiar with and skilled at most basic pilates moves so the actual workouts themselves were OK. However, I realize I am not a big fan of Ana Caban. Even being an experienced practitioner of pilates, I like the reminders on breathing and stance and that is not something that I found too much with this DVD. If looking for good full body pilates DVDs, I would highly recommend any and all of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs. I own them all and love mixing it up.",1266796800,11,927,4.0989010989010985
3652480,3,B001J65R6Q,"I contacted Gaiam about the mysterious disconnect between the order of the 5 workouts on the back cover vs. the actual order on the DVD.  Following is the correct sequence:

1) AM Pilates with Jillian Hessel
2) PM Pilates with Ana Caban
3) Pilates for Weight Loss Maintenance with Ana Caban
4) Cardio Pilates with Ana Caban
5) Easy Pilates with Ana Caban",1266192000,110,354,4.603174603174603
3652481,5,B001J65R6Q,"I love pilates and find this mix fantastic- you can choose a workout you like- morning or pm. The cardio one is great as are the others. You get a great work out in 25-30 minutes. Highly recommend this. Have tried other pilates videos, but this really stands out, if you enjoy pilates, and are home wishing you were doing a pilates class- this will fit the bill and really make you happy you ordered it.",1255046400,5,403,4.315789473684211
3652482,5,B001J65R6Q,"and this DVD is a great place to start.  Each routine lasts between 15-30 minutes and offers a variety of different exercises and levels of difficulty.
The beginner work-out (15 minutes) is just that.  It starts out with modified positions and a shorter range of motion for most of the workout.  It is all mat work and a good place to start.
The 2nd-4th workouts are all around 30 minutes and are mostly mat work for intermediate to advanced exercisers.  The AM Pilates (4th) is different in that is starts with a series of jumps (scissor jumps, hops, jacks) etc., which I thought was too high of an intensisty before even warming up.  The Cardio Pilates  (3rd)is my favorite.  It is all mat work with traditional (The Hundred, Double Leg Lifts, The Teasers, Side Leg Series etc) pilates moves.  I can feel this one afterwards.
The 5th workout PM Pilates is a lower intesity level that would be appropriate for beginners. The back cover says that it is 27 minutes long, but it is actually about 15 minutes long.
I like the face that, if I have time, I can use this DVD for an all-over hour long workout, or if I'm short on time, a quick 15 minute workout. Overall, this is a good place to start and you will grow with this DVD.",1251849600,27,1227,4.4222222222222225
8312061,4,B001J65R6Q,"Love it,  but at least on my copy,  the numbers on the case do not match the numbers of the programs on the disk.",1500508800,,113,3.6666666666666665
8312062,2,B001J65R6Q,"The menu of the DVD shows 5 selections, each numbered (One, Two, Three, Four, Five).  At no time does the menu or any program begin with a title identifying an exercise as one of the routines listed on the back of the DVD case (each of the 5 routines has a name - not a number - on the back of the case).  Furthermore, the exercises on the DVD are not in the same order as they are listed on the back of the case, so it's anyone's guess which exercise is which.  I wanted to try the second workout listed on the case (Maintenance PIlates for Weight Loss), so I though, okay, sure, I'll go to Number Two on the DVD, because that makes sense, right?  Except that the Number Two appears to be either the AM or PM Pilates, although it's impossible to tell which, because as mentioned earlier NONE OF THE WORKOUTS IS IDENTIFIED BY NAME ON THE DISC AND THEY ARE NOT IN THE ORDER LISTED ON THE CASE.  The very first workout (Number One) must be the fourth workout listed on the case; this is the only one that can be positively identified because it's the only workout done by a different person than the rest (Jillian Hessel).  So Number One is #4 and beyond that I have NO idea what any of the workouts on this stupid stupid stupid stupid DVD are.  I think this is going straight into the charity pile.  What a waste of money.  What a stupid way to package a set of workout, with no identifiers as to which workout is which.  Who dropped the ball on this one, I wonder.  Not well done, Gaiam.",1499040000,,1487,4.182456140350877
8312063,5,B001J65R6Q,"I had high expectations  for this Pilates DVD after reading several of the wonderful reviews.  And I'm happy to report that doing it for the first time felt like ""coming home""!!  (I love it!)!  In my 30s and 40s I exercised primarily by doing aerobics with weights (using THE FIRM dvds). After that my exercise routines got sporadic and while I liked doing Pilates & Yoga occasionally, I've honestly  found many of them kind of annoying for one reason or another. Often it took too long to do them - I may be retired now, but, I'm still very busy with family obligations, etc.  I was in a terrible car crash about a month ago & have been regaining my strength & flexibility since then. Since the accident, I've totally reordered my life - I've started prioritizing My Health.  Every morning after breakfast I exercise, even if that means doing just 4 Yoga poses, or 10 sit-ups and 10 push-ups from the knees.  But, now, with this ""5 Day Pilates"" DVD I can cover everything - strength, flexibility, deep relaxation, balance, and resistance training at once!!  One of my favorite aspects of this DVD is that you don't have to watch the screen at all if you don't want to she guides you through the stretches and poses with her clear voice cues -  how liberating!!  Note: A few years back, I rescued a young thoroughbred mare (former racehorse).  She's full of spunk, and I have to stay strong & flexible to ride her effectively and safely.
I feel younger, stronger and more active than anyone else my age (67). Truth be told, as a former medical pro I can tell you that EXERCISE is the best ""medication"".  So glad I found an indoor form that I really like this much!!",1481241600,2,1665,4.4916943521594686
