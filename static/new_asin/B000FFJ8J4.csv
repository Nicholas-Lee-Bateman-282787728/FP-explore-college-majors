8121814,4,B000FFJ8J4,"Any fan of the Mexilucahero genre should own a copy of this DVD.The Champions of Justice features a group of luchadors who have come to be known as Mexico's answer to the Justice League of America. In this their premiere adventure Blue Demon,Mil Mascaras,Tinieblas,el Medico Asesino, and la Sombra Vengadora team up to battle a mad scientist and his minions, including a squadron of super-strong masked midgets. Also included in this film aside from the usual fights in and out of the squared circle are motorcycle and dune-buggy chases. Plus there is a plethora of Mexican pulchritude provided by the actresses portraying the Champions'respective nieces(girl friends) who in the course  of the film are kidnapped by the film's villian. Good comic book-like fun. The second film on this disc stars Mexico's Holy Trinity of Wrestling, Santo,Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras. In this their second and final teaming the 3 heroes  battle enemy agents as well as alien invaders from outer space. But just as much fun  as the action sequences is watching the masked men romance a trio of Mexican beauties. Neither film is dubbed into English,but you shouldn't have too much trouble following the comic book-like storylines.",1243296000,,1213,5.116161616161616
