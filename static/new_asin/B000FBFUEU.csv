2559148,5,B000FBFUEU,"I was complaining about my body one year after giving birth to my son so my friend got me the Boot Camp Burn It and Firm It videos.  Apparently, Tracey Mallett, who does the videos is the mother of two small children. Wow! Not only does she have an amazing physique, but she is a great teacher and super motivational too.  I have been doing them for 2 weeks now and have already lost 6 lbs. I recommend alternating between the two videos; the Burn It DVD is difficult if you haven't done much cardio boxing before, but I am getting better and seeing great results.  The Firm It DVD requires an exercise band (not included) and is my favorite.  My only complaint is that there are too many close-ups in Firm It and I can't always see the exercise on the screen.  Now that I have done the video a bunch of times though, it doesn't really matter. And the bottom line is that, thanks to these videos,  I look great in my jeans now!",1157414400,13,927,4.238636363636363

2559150,5,B000FBFUEU,"This video is fun and a great workout. The instructor's cueing was amazing, it was so easy to follow.

Great for ALL levels and I like that it combined kick boxing with strength training and a great ab section inspired by Pilates at the end!

Her other DVD Firm It is my favorite but this is a nice compliment on the off days.

Tracey is a very motivating instructor!",1156636800,4,367,4.2898550724637685
2559151,1,B000FBFUEU,"There was not a flow in the movements. Tracy seemed unsure of herself and so does her ""boot campers."" She doesn't give much guidance on how to do the moves, meaning that a beginner has a greater chance for injury. If you're into Tae Bo or Turbo Jam, this will seem really amateurish. However, Tracey does have incredible abs. But, I don't think she got them doing this work out!",1156464000,3,378,4.414285714285715
2559152,5,B000FBFUEU,"To be honest, I don't know what made me pick up this dvd, because I'd never heard of the instructor or the series, but I'm so glad I did because it's really good.

This program is very different to what I've seen before.  It's both Pilates and kickboxing in really fast body sculpting routines.  It will shock your muscles for sure because they may not have been worked like that before.  It's led by a good and enthusiastic instructor, Tracey Mallett and she is all about having fun.  You will need one of those X-ertube and that's about it.  It's fun and challenging but so good because of the fact that it's different from other routines.  They also filmed it outdoors and that's refreshing from the usual studio sets.  I like this a lot and highly recommend it.",1156291200,6,765,4.492753623188406
2559153,5,B000FBFUEU,"I bought Boot Camp Firm it - loved Tracey's energy so much that I got this one ""Burn it"" as well. This work out is good - I certainly feel like I got my money's worth! WOW It is inspiring - you can do as much of the exercise as you like and Tracey gives you good guidance and pushes you along. I definately feel a difference after ONE work out!!!! This will have me looking 17 again in no time. If you are up for a good workout that pushes you this is the one to get! I'm hooked.",1155686400,2,479,3.8
2559154,5,B000FBFUEU,"I am a average exerciser and felt like giving myself a little butt kick with Tracey Mallett's Firm it! What a lot of fun! Tracey has a lovely energy and motivates one along - when ever it got a little challenging I could always do an alternative - now I can do the whole DVD. My butt and stomach have not looked this good in years so I'm thrilled. I do the DVD 2 -3 times a week and it's like a small dance class in one section - a lot of fun.

It really is easy - by week two I was seeing visable results which is motivating. I know you will see results to. I highly recommend this to anyone like me who felt like getting a little shape back to their body FAST. It worked for me - and my husband loves it!",1155686400,10,706,3.835616438356164
2559155,5,B000FBFUEU,"I love Tracy Mallett's workouts!

Firm It is split up in to five sections Warm up, standing lower body,Upper body, floor butt work and finishes off with abs.

Lot's of fun inovative exercises combining elements of kickboxing, Pilates and traditional sports moves.

I'm now a busy mom and like that I can choose a section and they're only about 15 minutes.

Tracey has a fun motivating style that keeps you going.",1154131200,15,412,4.76056338028169
2559156,5,B000FBFUEU,"i love tracey's boot camps. this one has segments broken up so i can do one or two if i am tired or don't have much time, or all of it if i get excited and have lots of energy. i like the way she puts drills together, so it is not boring and uses all of your body. it has been great for my hips and thighs and i always raise my heart rate!
thanks tracey!",1268697600,,354,3.6103896103896105
2559157,2,B000FBFUEU,"This intermediate-level (I wouldn't dare give a lower level) workout is broken up into segments which you can jump to on the menu but unlike other segmented workout videos, this workout is not customizable (i.e. the 10-min Solution workouts).  While there is a modifier in this workout, she pretty much does all the moves at the same level as everyone else.  The instructor sounds as if she has a lisp, so it's kind of hard to understand what she's saying, even after viewing the workout multiple times.

If you have bad knees, be forewarned:  there are a LOT of squats in this workout.  They are used in both the actual workout segments and used as a transition move between exercises.

I don't think of myself as being necessarily picky so while these things might bother other people, I wasn't deterred to give this a try.

Equipment:  One set 3-5 pounds hand weights and an exercise mat.  Oh, yeah . . . you're gonna need a bit of space for some of the moves.

Segments:

Basic Training:  Basically a warm-up.  Includes step-touches, bob and weaves, various punches (jabs, crosses, hooks, upper-cuts), squats, kicks, and stretches

Drill Segment:  Jogs, gallops, football runs, ""in and outs"" (jumping jacks w/o the arms) and jabs, squats w/ chest flies, cutsey squats and lateral raises, jump squats

Power Segment:  ""Prepare"" (pivoting to ""prepare"" to kick), squats, ""Prepare"" to a round-house kick, side steps, snap kicks, body builders, mountain climbers

Ultimate Drill: Jab/cross/squat combo, high/low jabs, gallops

Intense Body Burn:  Forward flies, ""monkey jumps"" (she doesn't give a name to these but that's what I've heard them referred to as) alternating between full jumps and a low-impact version with no jumps

Push-Up Segment:  A total of 20 regular push-ups, forward and side lunges, football runs and quick punches

Cool Down:  A less intense repeat of the warm-up

*Bonus:  Six-Pack Abs:  A 10-min Pilates inspired ab workout

My personal Pros and Cons:

PROS:
1.  This workout will definitely get your heart-rate up.

2.  This work-out is challenging. (The background exercisers apparently thought so, too.  They would completely stop or do their own modified versions throughout the workout.)

3.  Tracey cues pretty well.

CONS:

1.  Like another reviewer said, this workout (particularly the kickboxing portions) seemed a bit amaturish.

2.  During the parts where weights are used, the camera does a quick fade in/fade out and the exercisers already have their weights and are performing the exercise before you even get yours in your hand.  I could have let that side, if it wasn't consistant.

3.  There is virtually no instruction on technique.  There are a couple of moves (very, very few) that she ""previews"" (i.e. body-builders) but that's all.

4.  Tracey just seemed to try way too hard to be cheerful and perky.  This made her seem fake and corny.  Typically, perky instructors don't bother me but she was way over the top.

This is my first Tracey Mallett workout and I was REALLY excited to do this.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get passed the negatives.  This one ended up at a movie trade store.",1261094400,4,3138,4.972920696324952
2559158,1,B000FBFUEU,"Tracey Mallett is a talented trainer.  However, her style doesn't translate well onto dvd. She wears these big palazzo pants that are very distracting and makes it hard to see the proper movement.  It is obvious to tell that her team is not in sync and they don't reallly know each other ... it affects your mood & how well you engage with the workout.  I purchased this dvd looking for a high intensity, fat burning workout.  I did not work up much of a sweat at all.  I followed the high reviews for this dvd and was seriously disappointed.  My favorites right now at home are Crunch Boot Camp and Women's Health Total Workout in Ten ... I would highly recommend those dvds.  I used Tracey Mallett's workout about 2-3 times and now I've already sold it on ebay.",1251936000,2,763,4.4071428571428575
2559159,5,B000FBFUEU,"I'm an intermediate exerciser.  I've never done any workout by Tracey before.  I really enjoyed it.  She does a great job cueing.  You need an exercise band to do the arm section and some of the leg exercises.  It was a nice change from using weights.  It hit every part of the body.  I felt the workout most in my legs and especially my abs.  They are still burning, and I finished the workout at least 30 minutes ago.  I didn't find the arm workout challenging enough, but that is probably because they are the most in shape part of my body.  I rented the video online from Blockbuster.  I don't think I would buy it personally because while I enjoyed it, the workout won't push me to the next level.  I'd rent the video again though.  It is a nice change from what I'm already doing.  I'd recommend buying it for intermediate exercisers who want to maintain their level or a beginner who wants to push to an intermediate level.",1241222400,2,930,4.362573099415204
2559160,3,B000FBFUEU,"I think this is a good all-around toning video.  It's good for guys and gals, including the fact that it has a couple of guys doing the moves so it doesn't seem ""just for women.""  I think you get the idea of the moves and what you need equipment-wise after a few viewings.  Here are my issues:
- there were several times when Tracy is showing moves using the feet and legs and the camera is focused on the upper body, so you can't easily follow
- she changes from one exercise to another very quickly, sometimes without much of a slow intro, so only after a few viewings will you follow along ok
- they should say that you should have an exercise mat available, for some of the things you do on the floor.  The exercise ""tube"" is optional, but helpful.

Other than that, the high energy and cheery tone was good.  The time does fly by before you know it!",1240876800,,854,4.208588957055214
2559161,5,B000FBFUEU,Tracey is so motivational and I LOVE her beautiful voice...how inspiring! I have used this workout to get back in shape from my previous pregnancy. I intend to use it again very soon to get my body back when I get the okay from my MD. The workout is total body and mixes kick boxing with conditioning moves. You will definietly sweat and lose fat. I found it very demanding but that's what you need for results. So if you want a workout that gets results this is the workout!!,1216166400,,476,4.3
2559162,2,B000FBFUEU,If you can get past the instructor's annoying voice and the cast's silly wardrobe...the workout is not as challenging as I would have expected.,1215993600,,143,5.0
2559163,4,B000FBFUEU,"I recently bought the Jillian ripped in 30 and it clicked in my mind to go see if I had any other DVDs since I found Jilllian's boring, though effective.  Right on the shelf was my go to DVD, Boot Camp by Tracey Mallett.  This DVD works better than any other DVD I use and once I get the results I stop using it and go buy some other DVD.  This DVD is great because Tracey has the type of body I like, thin and non-muscular, she knows the right moves to do.  Also, Tracey has the BEST ABS on the market.  She actually has a 6 pack and you rarely see that on women, even Jillian Michaels.

The DVD is mainly jabs, lunges, various forms of jacks on the floor and running men on the floor along with weighted moves like the flies and the lunges.

I am tired doing this DVD.  This is a DVD where you can UP the intensity yourself by using higher weights or jumping or jabbing with weights, it's pretty variable.

My issue had become my stomach from drinking so many sodas.  Doing this DVD once or twice always goes right into that part of the stomach that wants to gain weight and widdle it down.

Tracey Mallet would be a much bigger exercise DVD seller, but for the fact that she seems like a cheerleader rather than a trainer.  People shouldn't sleep on her though, on this DVD, at least because she is really good.

Some of other DVDs are bad though...the latest ones just copy the moves off this one and her Cardio Bootcamp is just cheesy because she mixes pilates and dance moves with bad outfits to try to make herself more marketable.

Note: This review was written April 16, 2011.  I am not sure why it has a 2008 date.",1209340800,,1624,4.193548387096774
2559164,4,B000FBFUEU,"I enjoy Tracey Mallett's Burn It DVD.  Frankly, Its NOT an easy workout. Maybe thats good news to some and bad news for others. I'd definitely say between Intermediate to Advanced Level.  You have to be working out for sometime at a Beginner to Intermediate Level to be able to get through the entire duration of this DVD.
  I have to say its not a DVD I can pick up on any day and say sure I'll workout.  On those days, I need something lighter like Janis Saffels cardio fix. But like Tracey recommends if you want to shape up right, do this 3 to 4 times a week.  I do it more like twice a week and light workouts on other days.
This DVD contains resistance, aerobics, kickboxing, stretching and ab work.  So its a complete workout.  But yeah, if you are like me, you'll probably want to pair another DVD to go along with this on other days of the week.
  As an instructor, she is cheery, and seems to be trying quite a bit to include the ""fun"" element.  I like to be positive, so I look at it in a nice way.  She's got her thick British accent too which is enjoyable as well.
  Equipment wise, you will need dumbells and decent floor space, couple of sections call for you to move around. You could do it in place, but you are better off with at least 5x7 space.  Overall, if you don't have too much space and just enough, this is still doable, I still wouldn't pass on this DVD.
  Each time I do this DVD, I am certain that I'll get a very good workout to the point that I'll definitely be quite sore and don't have to worry about focusing on various body parts.  Its quite complete.",1207267200,2,1586,4.161184210526316
2559165,3,B000FBFUEU,"I thought this DVD was okay. The exercises are good exercises, but it felt as though Tracy switched from one to another somewhat too quickly. At times, I wanted to do more repetitions than what she did. The music was really boring, and although I thought the exercises were good, I can't really say I enjoyed this DVD. I will learn the exercises in the workout, and then do them on my own to my own music.",1205884800,3,405,4.2727272727272725
2559166,3,B000FBFUEU,"I agree with the other reviews in that you will get a good workout from this DVD, but I found it boring.  I have used the Tracey Mallet Boot Camp from the Method Series (which I liked a lot), and this workout is very much like it.  However, in this workout, I found that the camera angles were not so helpful at times, particularly if you are trying to find the modified version of a move.  I highly recommend the Shape Boot Camp workouts, as they have better instruction and more innovative routines.  This is just my opinion, so if you like Tracey Mallet, then by all means, give this one a try.",1177545600,4,597,4.256637168141593
2559167,4,B000FBFUEU,"I really enjoyed this workout. It's not a cardio workout, it's definitely a firming workout, focusing on abs and buns. You do need a tube, although you can still do the workout without it. I really like Tracey she's so upbeat and positive. I love that she's so versatile and has a lot of different excercises so you don't get bored, and the punches and kicks are fun. This is a good workout to do every other day, it would be challenging for a beginner, and a good workout for someone more advanced, but if you're looking for super challenging this isn't the workout for you. Have fun and enjoy!",1175644800,3,595,4.418181818181818
2559168,5,B000FBFUEU,"I will happily admit that I am not very co-oridinated - but I can keep up with this ""back to basics"" dvd. It is high energy & gets a sweat going - but not so complicated that I can't keep up.  I enjoy Tracey's style - the workouts are fun and motivating.",1175126400,,254,3.8846153846153846
2559169,5,B000FBFUEU,I have been doing home videos regularly and consistantly for 4 years.  I am always excited to find something new that really works my whole body.  Tracey Mallett's cardio intervals provide a great workout and combining it with strength training gives me the result of truly working everything and revving up my metabolism.  I've been doing the workout for a little over a month and I can see my obliques are finally toning-up!  Tracey's style is so encouraging and her workout is challenging.  I have several of her other DVDs and this one is my favorite!,1173830400,2,555,4.739583333333333
2559170,5,B000FBFUEU,"I'd been trying to loose the post pregnancy weight with very little results until I found Tracey's Method show on Fit TV. This prompted me to get the bootcamp dvd. The first week I lost 4 Lbs. If you haven't exercised in a while it's a very intense workout combining cardio, strength training ( you need a set of 5lbs weights) and kickboxing with basketball and football drills, but if you stay consistant and don't expect to do it all at once you will see fast results. The DVD is actually split up in sections depending on how much time you can give to the workout each day but that also helps with determining your pace. The bonus Ab workout is awesome I lost the post baby bulge in a month!",1173830400,3,694,4.305343511450381
2559171,5,B000FBFUEU,"I luv this workout!! She mixes it up a lot.. unlike alot of other workouts you follow and do the same thing ""Over, and Over, and Over again"".. there's definitely Cardio and Strengthening... and ABS!!!",1173744000,5,200,4.742857142857143
2559172,4,B000FBFUEU,"This is my first Tracey Mallet workout.  Cathe Friedrich is still my favorite, but Tracey does a good job with this workout.  The only difficulty in the beginning was Tracey's accent.  I really had to listen carefully to get what she was saying, but once you have done the workout a few times, you'll get it.  It's low-impact but a lot of the moves are challenging and interesting.  She demonstrates the moves slowly in the beginning, then picks up the pace.  It's fun and enjoyable.",1170547200,3,483,4.623529411764705
2559173,5,B000FBFUEU,This is a total body toning workout in which a tube will be used for the upper body segment. Ms. Mallett is helpful in breaking down the steps for a kicking routine.  She emphasizes having fun and you will sense that with her dynamite smile and her laughter throughout.  You have the freedom to select your workout because there is a chapter selection and the amount of time for each. Good for beginners.,1164844800,3,404,4.52054794520548
2559174,3,B000FBFUEU,"This is set up like a boot camp from their camouflage outfits to the titles of the workout segments Basic training, drill, power, etc. It's a good idea that the segments have the times listed for those limited on time. Ms. Mallett emphasizes to have fun in your workouts, and in this workout she successfully expresses that.",1164844800,2,324,4.701754385964913
2559175,5,B000FBFUEU,If you have ever done any of Tracey's Method workouts you know her style and can appreciate her energy.  This is a great mix of kick boxing moves with light weight sections that will get your heart rate up and sweat pouring.  This is broken up into 5 sections and you will know you did this workout the next day.  The instruction in this workout is a lot better then the ones you will find in firm it and I think a much better program over all.  There is some real challenging sections that will work you to the core.  (the reason why Tracey has such amazing abs!)The best section in my opinion is the 10 minute ab section that uses pilates inspired moves.  You will feel and see results after this section.  Tracey is full of energy and this is a great workout to add to anyone's rotation to reach their weightloss goals.,1164240000,14,822,4.298701298701299
8120015,5,B000FBFUEU,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND REALLY ENJOYED IT.  I GOT THE BEST RESULTS WITH THE AB SEGMENT.

SORRY JILLIAN, BUT TRACEY'S AB WORKOUT GAVE ME QUICK, NOTICABLE CHANGES RIGHT AWAY.  SO TODAY I WENT ON AMAZON AND FOUND ANOTHER COPY.

8120019,5,B000FBFUEU,"I've been doing workout DVDs for over a year. I picked this DVD up at  yard sale but I am sold now on Tracy Mallet. She's a little goofy but she's cute and an excellent instructor. I'm 52 years old and not what you call buff but I am healthy and like a challenge. Her instructional techniques and the way she explains things gives me a heads up on what is coming up and enough practice within the particular move to master it.

Its a great mix of several domains including pilates, tai chi, boxing, boot camp and others.

Tracy is energetic but not so much that you can't keep up. She's got great personal style and is very likeable!",1392249600,,633,4.258333333333334
8120020,5,B000FBFUEU,"I was so pleasantly surprised with this video, as I bought it on a whim, without knowing anything about the instructor. Tracey Mallett is GREAT! I love her attitude and most importantly the workouts kicked my butt! I'm pretty fit/exercise a lot and it's hard to find a workout video that is actually comparable to a class at the gym and this is totally that. The only NOT positive aspect is that sometimes she does this fast squat between moves and I have to be super careful to not do that as my knees are not great and she goes a bit faster than what feels comfortable for ME.

I actually looked her up after doing the video a few times and found some classes she teaches personally. She is great!!",1339027200,,700,4.343511450381679
8120021,5,B000FBFUEU,"I really enjoy Tracey Mallets workouts.  I like that they are circuit training with compound moves that work multi-muscle groups at once mixed in with some cardio to really kick up the metabolism.
I like that they are broken up into segments so you can mix and match based on time.

Some of the moves are challenging, but she doesn't have you doing them so long that it feels unbearable.  You get a great burn.  You can go at your own pace as she does have one exerciser doing modify movements.

If you enjoy any of her other videos you will enjoy this.  Some other instructors I enjoy are Kelly Coffee Meyer, Cathe Friedrich, Christi Taylor, Crunch Dance of The Inches, Jazzercise Burlesque.",1330300800,,692,4.585365853658536

8120023,4,B000FBFUEU,"I'm pretty picky on my videos, and at first I wasn't sure about this, but I really did like it. Her teaching style is very different (maybe it is the accent). She is really pleasant. The video was shot outside, so it was great scenery. My butt really hurt the next day! She really had some good exercises, and it was very entertaining. It was really different from a lot of the other videos. I wouldn't say it was the hardest video I've done (I'm pretty advanced) but I really did enjoy it. It is good for a change of pace.
