6254247,4,B00I8Z4VIQ,"""L'Immortelle"" is one of several recent releases of films written and directed by French writer and film-maker Alain Robb-Grillet.  In North America it appears that the Redemption DVD authoring group have secured the rights to distribute his works - while in England the British Film Institute (BFI) has the honor.  Redemption has issued 5 films/disks 'individually' while the BFI  has presented them in a nice 6 film retrospective box-set ( a format that is ultimately less expensive per film).  The BFI set is , however, in the Euro Region 2 PAL format and requires a 'region-free' DVD player to view.  Regardless of 'region code/format' these are films well worth checking out!

The majority of Robb-Grillete's works have been generally un-available for 'home viewing' for decades. - this current collection presents some of his earliest works from the 1960-70's period when he was first trying his hand as a Director, after achieving his initial recognition for scripting the French art-house classic: ""Last Year At Marienbad"".  ""L'Immortelle"" was, in fact, his first solo directorial outing and it continues to feature many of the surreal and enigmatic elements that were explored in '...Marienbad"".

After viewing a body of Robb-Grillete's works, and reading some analysis of his films by cinema scholars, a pattern begins to emerge that helps the viewer to appreciate where he was coming from and what he was trying to achieve.  Such background info is really helpful because, without it, his films may initially seem very disjointed and abstract - even by art-house standards.  Robb-Grillete enjoyed 'playing with' the peculiarities inherent in the format of cinema and using , and 'abusing' them, to his own ends to create a film experience that challenges the viewer's normal expectations for how a film should evolve.  He pretty much ignores the concept of a linear plot progression in most of his scenarios and his plots and characters constantly fold back in upon themselves providing multiple viewpoints and time frames that ultimately provide a very surreal experience.  One should not expect everything to wrap up tidily at the end of the show but one may expect the film to 'stick with them' for a while after viewing due to the provocative nature of the images and concepts presented - almost like a 'waking-dream'.

Alain Robb-Grillete, & his 'partner' Catherine (who makes regular appearances in his films) were both noted for their ""outre' "" sexual preferences that leaned in the BDSM direction, and many of his films featured elements that portrayed this personal penchant for  S/M symbolism and lifestyle.  Not surprisingly - this flirtation with 'forbidden' sexual practices often drew the ire of film censors and some of his film's were 'banned' in certain countries for many years - contributing to his obscurity and the (previous) difficulty in accessing his works.  Ironically (and despite all the '50 Shades of Gray' allusions on the box cover)  ""L'Immortelle"" actually contains virtually no images or references to these themes of sexual dominance & submission!... nor any 'nudity' within its' contents - whereas later films ( such as 'Trans Europe Express', 'Successive Slidings of Pleasure"", and ""Gradiva' for example) provide a hefty dose of the aforementioned.

That info notwithstanding - ""L'Immortelle"" is one of the 'spaciest' most intriguing movies I have seen in a long while and qualifies as a genuine surreal experience.  It is practically useless to try to describe its' 'plot' because it doesn't really have one, yet the film mesmerizes the viewer with a hypnotic quality that is quite unique. Beautifully filmed in B&W in exotic locales in Instanbul, Turkey - the 'place' becomes an integral part of Robbe-Grillete's 'vision' and alludes to fantasies of mysterious Eastern harems & slave girls as personified by the belly-dancer on the box cover who is featured in a brief dance segment - the characters, and audience, are caught up in Robb-Grillete's dream-like spell.  ""L'Immortelle"" is a great intro to this creative film-maker's work and a pretty psychedelic viewing experience.  Highly recommended!

6254248,4,B00I8Z4VIQ,"His first shot at directing has similar tones as Last Year At Marienbad as beautiful, beguiling, and bewitching. Is she there and then she isn't as a tale of travels and escapades in ancient Istanbul. Does she? Or doesn't she? One of the 1st true mysteries as riddle wrapped as an enigma. Good stuff from 1963 if you have the heart and head to follow, you too can wind up confused and totally taken by this rapturous beauty. Started before he assisted Alain Resnais and finished sometime after completion of that project so this was three years in the making makes for near perfection as I see it. Go figure if you can.",1404864000,6,619,4.486725663716814
6254249,4,B00I8Z4VIQ,"While being burned at the stake, a witch curses her executioners. Nearby, a convent is besieged by impure thoughts, deeds, and general naughtiness. Yep, the witch's curse is at work. Demons have taken possession of the unwary sisters. Wanton, wicked nakedness ensues. THE DEMONS is a Jess Franco film, so it simply MUST contain copious female nudity and perverse situations, along w/ torture and bloodletting. Still, just what would a demonized convent look like if not like this? Stars Franco regular Howard Vernon as Lord Malcolm de Winter. Contains the infamous ""virginity check"" and ""bride of Satan"" sequences. Oh dear! Those accustomed to Franco's proclivities will definitely enjoy this one. Others may wish to look elsewhere...",1404604800,,734,5.336206896551724
6254250,3,B00I8Z4VIQ,"Throughout the late sixties and early seventies, films on witchcraft and the occult were prolific in Europe and the states culminating in Director Ken Russell's 'THE DEVILS'-1971 which kick started the nunsploitation genre of films that continued well into the eighties in Italy.  Because of this , Producer Robert De Nesle approached Director Jess Franco to do a similar film to Russell's.  Franco was coming off his Frankenstein/Dracula movie monster period and utilized the same actors ( Anne Liebert, Britt Nichols, Howard Vernon, Alberto Dalbes, Luis Barboo) to write and lens (under his Clifford Brown name) 'LES DEMONS' aka 'THE DEMONS' which incorporated many homages to his early films such as 'JUSTINE'  aka 'JUSTINE AND JULIET'- 1968 and even used the character of Lord Jeffreys from  'THE BLOODY JUDGE' aka 'NIGHT OF THE BLOOD MONSTER'-1969 played by Christopher Lee .  The film starts off in familiar territory for Euro Horror fans with an accused witch being burned at the stake and cursing her violators from beyond the grave and then evolves into an amalgam of eroticism and revenge that only Franco could do well . The photography by future Director Raul Artigot shows off the castle interiors but the music score by Jean Bernard Raiteaux fluctuates from church organ/piano refrains to jazzy bongo rhythms which may startle some viewers.  Although this film has a great story line for a Franco title, it is bogged down by lengthy soft core lesbian and nun writhing scenes which makes the film clock in at under two hours. The film ,however, is pretty tame in the torture sequences showing Franco did not care for that type of ground.  Fans of that sort of thing should seek out Director Michael Armstrong's 'MARK OF THE DEVIL' -1971 to get their fill of that for the story concentrates on the witches daughters revenge plot against the characters responsible for her mothers burning. Redemption Video has released for the first time in the states the complete 118 minute French Version with English subtitles in a new master from 35mm elements.  The transfer has nary a scratch in its 2.35 1080p incarnation so fans can rejoice.  Extras include a 10 minute interview with Jess Franco on the films production which shows his dislike for the film; Deleted scenes which are from outtakes utilized to the trailers for the film but have no sound track; and trailers for other Franco films from Redemption. Not one of my Franco favorites , it is however an important release for fans of his work and Redemption deserves kudos once again for preserving these titles for future generations of Euro film lovers.",1400025600,15,2619,4.961187214611872

A witch burned at the stake hurls a curse at her condemners, and two young sisters at a nearby convent become embroiled (npi) in the game, seducing those responsible for her death. This is a re-release of a 1973 sex-ploitation film, originally a French-Portuguese production but set in England with English dialogue. There is a marginally solid storyline, but the main intent, of course, is just to show loads of T & A, and it pulls no punches there. There are also scenes of graphic torture--nude, of course--of young nuns, as well as of the powerful, sadistic, lesbian noblewoman Lady DeWinter (a fictional associate of the real-life ""Hanging Judge"" George Jeffreys) searching the nuns. There isn't a lot of really blatant gore--More in that area would have been too much of a distraction from all the sex and nudity, which must be even more explicit on Blu-ray. (I'm basing this review on an old VHS I bought back in the '80s.) Still, the torture scenes are hard to sit through, with a lot of terrible screaming and other disturbing elements. Regardless, those who want to watch DEMONS for other reasons--historical intrigue, ha-ha, perhaps?--can skip through these scenes to find what they are looking for.

On that subject, the time period, variously described as ""medieval,"" ""during the time of the Inquisition,"" etc, is a bit unclear because of the references to William of Orange's landing in England, which was in 1688, well after medieval times and long after the Inquisitions, which never occurred in England in the sense they did in other European countries. Hanging Judge Jeffreys was infamous for ordering many alleged traitors to King James II (but not necessarily ""witches"") tortured and executed in the 1680s. While there were still a few scattered executions for witchcraft in England during this time, they were done by hanging or pressing, not burning at the stake. The costume design looks partly 1600s, partly earlier. I know, I know: WHO CARES?! Historical accuracy was obviously not a big priority for the makers of this film, nor is it likely to be one for the average viewer of DEMONS ('73).

You probably get the picture. The main reason why I give Franco's DEMONS as high a rating as I do is that it succeeds at actually being what so much of today's low budget scare crap merely tries to be. Inaccuracies aside, the acting and settings, though still fairly fakey in many spots, as well as the general cinematography are quite decent for a film of this sort. Karin Field is particularly good as Lady DeWinter. Though most will watch it for the reasons described above, it is still possible for the strong-of-stomach to watch DEMONS as a simple exercise in historical horror.

This is the sort of film that, if it were made today, would probably never find any significant release to the general public, even on Redbox. The early 70s were wild and crazy times, but even then, this film was banned in British theaters and many other places. I notice that this version is an ""R""--I think the original was an ""X""--so it's possible that some of the more explicit or disturbing scenes have been edited.",1397433600,10,3137,4.8361266294227185

8639990,2,B00I8Z4VIQ,i was hopeful at the beginning of the movie for the story however what ultimately killed it for me was the torture scenes they were so bad and in the end the movie boiled down to a softcore porn and not much else,1527984000,,212,3.953488372093023

8639994,4,B00I8Z4VIQ,"I decided to provide a review on this one only because it impressed me a bit more compared with an average Franco film. This film was produced in France in 1973, and entitled Les Dmons. At that time, director Jess Franco was away from Spain avoiding the right wing dictatorship (and censorship) of another Franco. In the plot, a witch promises to take revenge on the Grand Inquisitor Jeffries and Lady de Winter who condemned her to die burned alive in public. As a result, these characters aim tracing the witch's daughters Kathleen (Anne Libert) and Margaret (Britt Nichols) who have been raised in a convent. In the remaining movie we see how these sisters manage to serve their mothers will.  In contrast to average or lower than average Franco films, this one does well in terms of overall acting, plot, costumes, and logic behind sequence of scenes. On top of all this, the film includes some of the most erotic female to female scenes produced by uncle Jess. By the way, the movie has a good dose of female (some male) nudity, and sex scenes are a bit more connected to the plot compared with your typical Franco fare. So, my overall rating is 4 stars IN THE FRANCO METER.

Technically, this Redemption Blu-ray release is a region A release. The image quality behind this digital transfer good to very good, but with some dark scenes with too many white specs. The audio comes in French with English subtitles. Extras include an interview with the maestro of the sleaze, deleted footage, and some trailers. Overall, a good film for followers of Jess Franco or those looking for European B-movies from the seventies.",1503360000,2,1622,4.72791519434629
8639995,1,B00I8Z4VIQ,"There are other good reviews of this movies so I won't reiterate. My rating is for this poor reissue of the original film.
Most of these Franco DVD re-mastered editions are Uncut & have an English Dub language option.
No English Dub on this version, only French with subtitles.
The original film was 113 minutes long so 20 minutes has now been mercilessly hacked out of this version.
Another 2nd  version was 103 minutes long, and so this newest issue is the most hacked & incomplete of all.
Franco is known & loved for dreamy surrealism, lovely eroticism, a lot of glorious female nudity with a nice whip of sadism.
So you just got suckered out 20 minutes of the intended fantastic version of the original film. Very Disappointing!
If you want the Demons film as intended you are better off finding an old DVD copy. Avoid this Blu-ray.",1496448000,,836,4.610738255033557

8639997,4,B00I8Z4VIQ,"I liked this movie way back when I saw it on VHS. The blue ray looks and sounds great but I wish that an English language dub had been offered as an option like on the VHS. I won't rehash the plot here, but if you are familiar with Jess Franco's other work and like it, then this shouldn't disappoint you. Atmospheric and slightly unsettling, just like good horror should be. Not particularly scary, but appropriately paced with a fairly interesting storyline. Not a ton of action, but this has other things going for it so look elsewhere if you want to be scared and need non-stop action in your horror. Thanks for your time. I hope this helps a little.",1456963200,2,654,4.413223140495868
