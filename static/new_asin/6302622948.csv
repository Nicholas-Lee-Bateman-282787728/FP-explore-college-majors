489261,5,6302622948,"Steven Soderbergh is such a very peculiar moviemaker that he does not follow any pattern. Each one of his films is one of a kind. And ""Kafka"" is not an exception. More than a cinebiography of the writer, the movie is a mix of many kafkanian situations, that adds up situations from some of his published work and events of his life.
Jeremy Irons plays the title character, who woks in a insurance company and writes during his spare time. He is a very lonely soul, and he has no family or friends at all, but he doesn't seem to care about it very much. But his life takes a spin when he finds himself in a conspiracy after the disapeareance of a work mate. In order to investigate it he gets more and more involved with a group of rebels.
The film is brillantly phographed in Black & White by Walt Lloyd, but be ready for a surprised in a key sequence. The screenplay smartly mixes up many excerpts from Kafka's writings and thigs thac actually happened to the late writer. It is hard to classify because most of the time it is thiller but it has some philosophical and sci-fi inserts.
As I said, the film alludes to many Kafka's works, but you do not need to have read or even know Kafka in order to enjoy and appreciate the picture. If you know him, you will have much more pleausure when watching the movie and you will get most of the references. If you don't know Kafka, you will probably get excited about him and you will look for reading some of his work and watching the film again afterwards.",1009497600,15,1502,4.310954063604241
489262,5,6302622948,"If you like weird movies, this one ranks up there with ""Eraserhead"", although it's much more...this is one of the most underrated films made, in my opinion. Filmed beautifully on location in Prague, and for the most part in truly magnificent black and white by cinematographer Walt Lloyd, and with a stellar cast of some of the best character actors around, it fascinates me more with each viewing.

It's my favorite Jeremy Irons vehicle...he's absolutely perfect for the part, with his gaunt nervousness, his synchronized facial twitches, and his ability to express deep gloom. Joel Grey is the boss from hell, Armin Mueller-Stahl is great as the police inspector, and other tasty bits of acting come from Theresa Russell, Jeroen Krabbe, Alec Guinness, and Ian Holm.

Another reason for seeing this film is in the hearing of it...the soundtrack by Cliff Martinez using a zither solo is exceptional. Moody, melodic, and unique, it greatly enhances the on screen action.

The story hardly has anything to do with Kafka's actual life, but is inspired from his stories, and has the atmosphere portrayed in them...fear, persecution, distrust of authority, the bewilderment of life itself, and that horrible little scabby laughing man !",987638400,35,1231,5.145
489263,4,6302622948,"A mezmorizing tale of the truth, deception, rebellion, and friends that turn their backs.  Jeremy Irons puts on an amazing performance as Franz  Kafka, the intellectual low-level clerk, that grudgingly continues his  meaningless tasks for the government.  Eventually becoming curious about  the nature of an anarchist group within his villiage limits, Kafka begins  his quest to discover the truth. A quest that will lead him to eventually  discover about how the government is controlling the denizens of his  villiage, and the gruesome experiments they conduct.  All in all, a great  thiller film, best suited for fans of either the Franz Kafka books or  anyone who enjoys a very complex plot and interesting story.",966816000,,717,5.256637168141593

489265,5,6302622948,"'Kafka' is one of my favorite films, second only to 'Eraserhead'. A paranoid and surreal thriller with a bravura performance from Jeremy Irons as Kafka. There are many scenes in this movie which I cherish.  The  delivery of the bomb.  Kafka's dialogue with Murnau. The first glimpse of  the giant microscope. Kafka's letter to his father, and too many more to  mention. This is brilliant film. Don't sit here simply reading these words,  go out and see it.  It doesn't matter what it takes, in the end, you will  love this movie.  That is, unless you are a miserabilist, unthinking  phillistine. But, I hope not.",949104000,9,612,4.742857142857143
489266,5,6302622948,"I discovered this movie by accident and have been devoted to the cause of promoting it ever since.  It is rarely found in video stores, but if you can possibly find a copy, rent it and watch it.  Make a bootleg copy.  Watch it again. Though those who have read Kafka's work will find the movie  to be a witty and intelligent synthesis of many of Kafka's stories, those  unfamiliar with Kafka's work will enjoy it also.  Paranoia,  totalitarianism, mind-numbing buerocracy that stifles the individual  soul--all of Kafka's great themes are here.  This is the best movie there  is about Kafka's stories, and though it has achieved little recognition in  the eight or nine years since its release, my hope is that by spreading the  word about this film, awareness of it will grow.  And by the way, Alec  Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi!) also appears in this movie; that should make it  worth watching at least once, even if you're not interested in Kafka.",925171200,6,946,4.717791411042945

489352,4,6302622948,"Why this dark, dazzling, disturbing early film by Steven Soderbergh isn't available on DVD is beyond me. While it might be a bit uneven in spots, its overall vision & appropriately oppressive, soul-crushing atmosphere is visionary ... of course, that vision is of the modern world's bureaucratic, mechanistic hell. Jeremy Irons excels as Kafka, his life mingling with his fiction to create a surreal, nightmarish experience for both the character & the viewers. Shot mostly in black-&-white, reserving color for one key sequence, it truly captures Kafka's experience & exploration of the individual adrift in an uncaring, even malignant world of human devising, but devoid of very much humanity. Yet its dreamlike quality makes it quite watchable without becoming overly depressing. It's definitely an overlooked film in this fine director's career, overdue for the Criterion treatment -- highly recommended!",1396656000,,908,5.539568345323741

I took a chance with this Korean import since it was All-Regions.  It appears to have been copied from the laser disc version as it has a few intermittent minor video artifacts suggesting such and evidence of a side-break.  So the picture is not equal to a quality DVD presentation but passable. You get used to it.  The sound, however, is very good.  I love the Eastern European musical score.

489360,2,6302622948,Inspired by German expressionism and film-noir this film fails to be genuinely paranoid as a running Jeremy Irons through film-noir nighttime streets of this Eastern European city fail to convince. The conceit is a brilliant one as individualism and hope is crushed in a totalitarium state where conformity is demanded. I hoped for a disturbing ending similar to what Terry Gilliam did to his protoganist at the end of BRAZIL. That ending was truly organic to the storytelling. The ending to KAFKA with Jeremy Irons did not have the chill factor I expected in this film. This is one of Soderbegh's early films and it shows. It needed to be deleriously paranoid and over-the-top. Apart from some startling visuals the film plays it extremely safe within the context of this genre. Soderbegh would go on and direct THE GOOD GERMAN and improve as a director from the soft movie that is KAFKA.,1314662400,,889,4.855263157894737

Over the years I have passed this movie around to dozens of people. Their reactions are almost always the same, ""HOW COME I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE?!""

How come, indeed. This was one of Soderbergh's earliest and (in my opinion) best directorial efforts. Irons is a perfect Kafka and Theresa Russell does a magnificent job with her sexy anarchist and love-interest role. One of the best characters is definitely Joel Grey's officious little insurance clerk-- the personification of ""the banality of evil"".

The switch to technicolor midway through the movie is pure genius and a nice touch after the noir feel of the first half. If you can beg or borrow a copy of this movie, DO IT NOW!",1305763200,,827,4.506666666666667

After viewing this film for the first time years ago, we planned a trip to Prague and visited all the places that ""Kafka"" goes to in the film.  It actually enhanced our understanding of the film (of course a trip to Prague is not necessary in order to enjoy this film).  Just understand that ""the castle"" that keeps getting mentioned is a city within the city and is the seat of government.  Watch and enjoy!!

489405,4,6302622948,"""KAFKA"" is one of those movies that was both negelected by the audience and the critics, and very unjustifiably so. What's exactly wrong with this picture? Is it because a lot of Very Heavy-Thinking Bookreaders claim that the real Franz Kafka is untouchable, and so: not-filmable, and there for, when this is done anyway, it must be condemned even before one single frame is actually seen?

But this is not about Mr. Real Kafka, it's about Mr. Fictitious Kafka, even one without Franz as a first name. This Mr. Fictitious Kafka writes about men transforming into giant insects, yes, and who works as a clerk in a insurance agency, yes, and who, at nightfall, sees a giant castle hoovering above the town in the distance, yes - but for all this, director Steven Soderbergh and screenplay writer Lemm Dobbs should be praised, (yes, even before a single frame has been seen.)

It's like a moviewriter's wet dream: to put The Real Kafka in his own nightmares, to make him a a pawn in his own fiction, and just see, with every page he slamms down on the typer, which way the story goes. Because The Real Kafka was the master of `dream logic', it's the movie writer's associative mind that can make the story about the Fictional Kafka flow in any direction it wants, taking strange turns here and there.

(Not that there shouldn't be a kind of narrative, a plot, but this plot may be based on tiny little super nova-explosions in the Imagination of the movie writer. And mind you, in straight Hollywood terms Imagination, The Great Imagination, is something rather underrated, or even: unappreciated. Because Great Imagination leads to Not-Understandable movies like ""Brazil"" or the stuff that David Lynch is born out of. And that scares away any decently raised movieproducer - auch! Talk about reals nightmares!!)

And every plot twist cooked up by This Great Imagination may be carried by strange creaures: zombie-like people with fixed grins on their faces, by two twin brotherish desk clerks who play a kind of dead pan slapstick between each others, by hysterical laughing stalkers with surgical incisions on their heads, and by irritating all-knowing police detectives who happen to look very much like Armin-Mueller Stahl.

And by Fictitious Kafka, of course, who maybe impersonates The Real Kafka when nobody is looking, but who rather stays anonymously hidden in the dark, in the back alleys of pittoresque Fictional Prague, or in his crammed little attic, writing his tiny little, barely read stories about people turning into giant insects and menacing castles.

Or about actor Jeremy Irons who dreams he shares the nightmares of a Real Fictitious Writer...",1148947200,5,2663,4.946308724832215

On the matter. Never have I seen anything even close to this movie. This does not mean, there is no movie better than this. This just means that ""Kafka"" is so incredibly different. It is stylish. Unbelievably accurate play. The sound track is gorgeous (as a matter of fact, I have not succeeded to find this soundtrack for 10 years yet). Cliff Martinez did wonderful job. As well as I know, he had looked for a seventy-something year old man (musician), found him in England and took him to Prague to have him play the cymbals forming amazing film entourage.

While I am defeated by the impossibility of 'making sense' of what happens here in any real way that involves logical explanation, I believe the film well-represents the scary furnishings inside Franz Kafka's mind. It doesn't move back and forth between dream and reality. Instead, it combines the two seamlessly. Only in one scene, a 'pure' dream, does the film move into color. The rest of the time it is a beautiful, grainy-foggy-textured black and white. Prague is gorgeously captured in the b/w universe. The zither score reminds one of The Third Man, another film about the ruin and corruption of Europe. I especially like that the nightmare localities, particularly the Castle interior, are imagined and furnished as 1919 phenomena. As a tour de force of reliving the interior imaginations that might have haunted a writer like Kafka, it's pretty impressive. But as a connected plot or statement, it's not much account. I'd call it intensely and sensitively atmosphere-of-Kafka, but to murky and nebulous to rise too far above that.",1077408000,5,1135,5.01058201058201

489410,5,6302622948,"""Kafka"" is uber-director Steven Soderbergh's finest hour, a mesmerizing, frequently terrifying, always splinteringly beautiful distillation of the paranoid works of Franz Kafka into a two-hour descent into duplicity, delusion, madness, and conspiracy.
Franz Kafka (played precisely and with aplomb by Jeremy Irons, in one of his best roles) is an anonymous, numberless bureaucrat laboring in the stifling confines of his office in a shadow-haunted city somewhere in Eastern Europe (the city Soderbergh uses is Prague, which, with its winding cobbled streets and menacing feudal castle, which Soderbergh develops into a major character in its own right).
Kafka is intellectually curious, though, and through his writing seeks escape from his wearying job as a clerk and the looming, austere tyranny of his lordly superior, the Chief Clerk (played with leonine reserve and typical brilliance by Sir Alec Guiness).
Kafka's work is the stuff of dark conspiratorial nightmare, plots within plots, revolutions brewing and quelled by ranks of faceless secret police, but after he befriends a group of anarchists and revolutionaries led by the mysterious Gabriela (played subtly by Theresa Russell), his life takes a turn for the bizarre, eerily paralleling his literary work, replete with disappearances, mysterious horrible deaths, shadowy night-time pursuits through the streets, and terrible rumors of malign plots hatched in the inaccessible Castle that hulks above the city.
""Kafka"" is subversive, insidious, breathtakingly beautiful and deliciously creepy work. It is also Soderbergh's best film, slipping as effortlessly between the real and surreal as it does between its black-and-white and color palettes. Soderbergh assembled a team that worked brilliantly together, including cinematographer Walt Lloyd, Set designer Joanne Woollard, and costume designer Michael Jeffery, to work a feat of cinematic magic.
The acting here is also uniformly seamless, with Irons alternately purringly subservient and winsomely brave; Irons delivers the goods as a man pushed up against the limitations of his courage. Russell shines in her brief but crucial role, Sir Alec Guinness brings a nice touch of Dickensian gloom to the picture, Armin Mueller-Stahl is note perfect as the sinister but befuddled Police Inspector Grubach, Ian Holm calmly psychotic as the evil Doctor Murnau (Holm uses the same line---""you don't belong here, do you?""---in three films: ""From Hell"", ""Brazil"", and this movie) and the great Brian Glover psychotically calm as his beetling, murderous hench-thug.
But the standout in ""Kafka"" is the atmosphere itself, thick with paranoid, horror, and intrigue. This is a movie fraught with secret passages, nitreous oubliettes, forgotten cemeteries, cobbled streets, fog-shrouded squares. All of this is nicely underscored by a haunting soundtrack by Cliff Martinez.
""Kafka"" is above all a movie where terror stalks the alleys and haunts of the City, terror as Beautiful as it is horrific, because in life the Nightmarish can also be Beautiful. And be warned: this is a truly frightening, grisly film that does its level best to give you nightmares. Kafka's wild flight from a hideous Laughing Man is the scariest sequence I have ever sweated through.
Not a biography but a stark and luminous journey into the mind of Franz Kafka, the movie is rich and layered with echoes of ""Metamorphosis"", ""In the Penal Colony"", ""The Castle"" and ""The Trial"".

I made attempts to read his letters, his diary, his novels, never managing to get all the way through one of his books till years later, but he held, and still holds a spell for me, started I think by this film. I watched it again years later and it didn't have the same magic and before, though I enjoyed it still. The scene of the wild man racing with total abandon down the dark streets in gleeful pursuit of his prey stayed with me delightfully for some years. As well as the interrogation scene: ""Kafka... Kafka... is that your REAL name?"" ""W... why shouldn't it be?"" And the slapstick yet malicious assistants...
