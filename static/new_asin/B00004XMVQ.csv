8188114,3,B00004XMVQ,"This is a traditional period Boccanegra (rather gloomy sets) with Milnes suitably imposing in the name part. That said, his voice is not at its best and Anna Tomowa-Sintow as Amelia is a little too matronly for my tastes. She sings affectingly when required to, though, which is more than can be said of Gabriele (Vasile Moldoveanu), probably the weakest of the principals. In the pit, James Levine drives the music too hard, so climaxes are inclined to be a touch overpowering and not a little brash. If you want to hear the subtleties and nuances of the score try the audio recording conducted by Abbado on DG - quite a revelation, and well cast, too). Video director Brian Large (usually reliable) is caught out a few times and there is the odd sensation as singers move from one side of the stage to the other and the vocal image falters, caught in a no man's land between the microphones. Very distracting. In sum, watchable enough but not one to die for.",1007337600,13,960,4.587209302325581
8188115,5,B00004XMVQ,"This is an excellent production of what is arguably one of Verdi's finest works.
It is an opera that both my wife, Sue, and I love from the first to the final chord, and we have been very fortunate to have seen it at Covent Garden on a number of ocassions.
This production from the NY Met is damn near perfect, every nuance and facet are catered for perfectly.  I have long admired the American Bariton Sherrill Milnes, here he is just perfect as the Doge Boccanegra - this could be his finest role.  Others are just as perfect, such as Paul Plishka's wonderful dour Fiesco and Anna Tomowa-Sintow's moving Amelia.
I am less impressed by Vasile Moldoveanu, a kind reviewer suggested he never set the world alight.  I would more unkindly suggest he is a very inferior tenor when you consider what the Met could have had available (aka, Carreras, Domingo, Kraus, Pavarotti) - but in a production and performance like this he becomes very acceptable.
This is an outstanding document of an outstanding opera.  I hope you buy it.  If you do you will witness Opera at it's very best.  Of course, a master composer producing an absolute masterpiece is a great help.  Enjoy it, you will see and hear no better.",1004227200,6,1201,4.58411214953271
8188116,5,B00004XMVQ,"Boccanegra is not always considered and audience-pleaser, but this DVD could quite possibly change your mind.  Four fine singers, a beautiful production (originally debuting in Chicago in 1974 with this reviewer in the Chorus) and fine video reproduction are strong recommendations.  Anna Tomowa-Sintow is vocally and visually radiant in her role, especially in her duet with Boccanegra (Sherril Milnes), just listen to her long held note, steady as a rock at the end of that duet and Milnes' perfectly placed pianissimo for his final note a few seconds later.  Vasile Moldoveanu never set the world on fire with his three telecasts at the Met (Don Carlo and IL Tabarro), but he is solid, reliable, easy on the eyes compared with many other  tenors of his time -- and is certainly acceptable.  Paul Plishka, then in his prime is a fine Fiesco and a good foil for his  enemy Boccanegra.  When the curtain goes up on the Council Chamber Scene, the audience gasps, (it always did in Chicago) as the enormous stained glass window dominates the entire  background of the scene which (added later by Verdi) is the  focal point of the opera.  Has Verdi ever been more powerful than during the ""Vo gridando pace"" ensemble?  If you don't know this opera, please take a chance on it with this video. ....if you do know this opera add it to your collection with total confidence.  A treasure, and a triumph for Milnes and Tomowa-Sintow.  Levine and the Met Orchestra and Chorus
aren't too shabby either: the chorus's whispered curses of ""Sia maledetto!"" at the end of the Council Chamber scene are hair-raising.  Slightly grainy black backgrounds are the only visual drawback, but they are quickly gotten used to. Run out and plunk down your 30 or so dollars. Enjoy!",986601600,18,1755,4.845637583892618
