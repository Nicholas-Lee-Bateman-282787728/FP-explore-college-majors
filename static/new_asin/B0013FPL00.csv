8250686,4,B0013FPL00,"There are two videos in this package, the first one covers equipment, knots and rigging and all kinds of baits. It is more of an overview and would be more useful to a less experienced fisherman, he does have some good tips and techniques. It seems like he's plugging the products and it's fairly slow. I did learn some interesting techniques some of which I have seen in the past but never used them, I do intend to use them upon my return back to the states from Afhanistan here in the next few months and am confident they will work well. I have seldom watched someone fish with his method of rigging but then I am more of a trout and steelhead fisherman. I plan on using this method for ice fishing, walleye and crappie fishing.
The second video shows fishing and applying the different techniques. The species shown are Trout, Bass, Crappie and walleye and was fairly entertaining. Overall I was pretty happy with the video and will use it for a reference and just to pass the time. Although it wasn't as hyped as I expected, I was not dissapointed with it's purchase and look forward to trying out these techniques.",1285372800,,1121,4.5
8250687,5,B0013FPL00,This guy can make a video!  A little more info on how to fish the rig would have been nice but he really covers it all as to putting it together.  So many videos are just adequate but this one is really sufficient and go's well beyond adequate.  I liked it so well that I bought his other video.,1263772800,2,295,3.9661016949152543
8250688,5,B0013FPL00,"While I usually fly-fish, I often have occasion to fish with friends and family and choose to use a spinning rod or baitcaster (much easier with those of non-fly persuasion or with several people in a boat.) This video is a tutorial for the effective use of drop-shotting. The information is good, the approach solid, and while it certainly didn't have a big-budget feel, it did have a knowledgeable guide and well-paced format. Good stuff, and it does work.",1255910400,,458,4.810126582278481
8250689,5,B0013FPL00,"I ordered this for my husband to keep him entertained at a family thing.  He loves it. He is sharing it with all his fishing buddies.  it very clearly demonstrates knot tying and a unusual way of rigging a hook.  My husband has  fished for over 50 years, rivers, ocean so if he's excited it must be good.",1208563200,4,304,4.189655172413793
