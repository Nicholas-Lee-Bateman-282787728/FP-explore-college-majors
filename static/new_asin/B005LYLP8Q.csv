It was a bit old fashioned in its concepts, predictable, I would not recommend it unless the buyer were a catholic, it might be nice for them to see. It offers maybe a different way of looking at what's next.",1326758400,11,386,4.301369863013699

It's a wonderful gift to the world right now - when we all need comfort and reassurance. I have no doubt that Chico Xavier is having the ""time of his life"" - having crossed over himself in 2002 - and is happy that one of the books that he and Dr. Luiz wrote  has become this beautiful film. Kudos to everyone who worked on it!",1325548800,27,444,4.103448275862069
4830784,5,B005LYLP8Q,"I don't usually take the time to write a review for films, even if I like them. I love this movie. I don't know anything about whether this was channeled or sent here by carrier pigeon, but the message is very close to what I believe as true. This story resonates in me in so many ways. Spiritual evolution, reincarnation, human melodrama, the battle with our lower nature, of ego, pride, self indulgence and most of all fear. I love movies about the afterlife and have seen many. This one goes further then the rest. The city of light, the reincarnation family/group, the ongoing journey of self discovery, spiritual evolution. God is love and vice versa.

Sincerely
The Grokfish

4830800,5,B005LYLP8Q,"I recently heard an interview with the director of this film.  Given that it was written by a man who channeled over 400 books and was a cultural phenom in Brazil, I had to check it out.  I also heard it was a huge hit in Brazil.  I have been studying the after life for a couple of decades now. To date, my favorite film about the afterlife, by far, is ""What Dreams May Come"". This comes pretty close to that for me in depicting what seems to be realistically what we might be able to expect. It covers the topics of hell, reincarnation, where we are likely to go next, higher realms than that, what about family when we die, will we work in heaven, what will the afterlife look like (is it like Earth, are we just energy)? what is the role of spirits in our earthly lives, etc.  There is SO much packed into this film that it's probably worth a second look.

The book is told from the perspective of a man who dies, goes to the afterlife where he experiences a tremendous amount of spiritual growth. It's not all sunshine and roses after death as he is essentially the same selfish, self-important man he was on Earth, but he progresses and wants to give back, ultimately finding a way to channel this book to Chico Xavier to give to all of us.

The film is beautifully done. It's in Portuguese with English subtitles. I hope it's remade in English so it reaches a wider worldwide audience.

I think instead of watching the film again, I will get the book, I've got to believe there is even more in the book than they were able to translate to film",1457913600,,1550,4.26962457337884

The ""hell"" experience isn't all that common and way overplayed, too much fear being presented here. The work is from some channeler and I'd have to say its not a quality source to build a movie on. I think one would be much better off, reading online accounts of people who had near death experiences, and pay particular attention to the ones who weren't steeped in religious ideas and dogma. Mellen Thomas Benedict and Nancy Danison had non-religious, and very in-depth NDE experiences. Things I objected in the film were the idea that  you had to ""earn points"" to visit your friends back on Earth, no you don't. The man portrayed had a hellish experience and from what I saw, there was no reason for him to have one. The information is very shallow and a one dimensional idea of non-physical reality. I would also highly recommend JOURNEY OF SOULS, and THE COSMIC CRADLE, if you want some real world peeks into where WE CAME FROM.

You almost don't even need to focus on what's being said to know what's going on.

4830858,4,B005LYLP8Q,"This film is pretty old and is based on even older source material.  A ""psychic"" in South America wrote quite a lot of books; this is a film distillation.  One has to remember the context (Brazil, about 4 years before the outbreak of World War I).  The real life ""psychic"" was Francisco Xavier.  The movie depicts a story of a Brazilian physician with a mediocre life (in good-bad terms) who dies and finds himself in the spiritual realms.

The belief system depicted here includes the idea of reincarnation.  I don't personally subscribe to that, but many do.  I found some elements of the concept of afterlife credible.  If you are not interested in any such speculation then you had better skip this altogether.

Those who have eyes and ears to see will see the truth in this story. The story is outwardly fictional or metaphorical, but the philosophy at it's core is quite true. I am so happy to see many getting something so meaningful out of the story.

There is much more extremely valuable material out there besides this particular ""channel"". Those who are Seeking, I invite you to Seek further.

To those who take it at face value, confuse it with the traditional view of heaven, or simply don't resonate with the philosophy present, I would suggest not to let it trouble you further.",1394668800,,699,4.67479674796748
4830867,2,B005LYLP8Q,"Imagining a heaven where people are brought in on stretchers and not allowed to have a house for 8 years until it is earned....It's just not a heaven I can subscribe to.  People (or spirits) in this film sort of walk around in the netherworld looking dazed and confused.  They have to live outside or in a hospital until they earn the right to have a house?  How depressing!  Oh, and having to writhe around in purgatory trying to siphon water from a sand pit---really?  There are hundreds of books and stories out there about life after death that offer a much more promising, realistic and loving view of our ""transition.""  Since we get to choose what we believe, and since ""heaven"" seems a different place to everyone who has experienced it, I am going to choose a much more loving and enlightened story to adopt as my model.  I can't subscribe to a heaven that feels distant, cold and seems to punish people for their imperfections.  Thankfully, when my father passed, I was able to communicate with him by way of a trusted and talented channeler within weeks of his passing.  He reiterated information to me that only he and I could know.  He didn't have to ""earn"" that in heaven--the chance to communicate with me.  When I reached out, he was able to communicate with me very soon after his death.  How sad that this author and movie make heaven seem like a punishment, scaring people into behaving in certain ways so they don't have to drink sandy water or live out on the streets until they ""earn"" shelter.  Everyone walks around withholding information from the dead person, making him wait to have answers and information, and showing him that only two people even cared about him or prayed for him in his life.  We live in a difficult world where most of us just do our best--imperfectly--but we all mostly do the best we can.  I hardly believe that a loving God would make our first weeks in heaven so miserable, confusing and cold.",1394064000,6,1944,4.561959654178675
4830868,5,B005LYLP8Q,"I confess that I found out about Astral City: A Spiritual Journey on Amazon Canada and had a chance to watch it on Hulu. Astral City: A Spiritual Journey is based on a 1944 book titled Nosso Lar by the late Brazilian author Chico Xavier.  I have already watched it twice and intend to eventually purchase the dvd. One of the reasons being is because the film beautifully depicts how a spirit can still grow and change for the positive in the spirit realm. I also like how the narrator (who also plays one of the lead parts in the film) pours his heart in playing a soul who candidly describes both the good and challenging aspects of returning to the true spiritual home.  The characters speak in what I am guessing to be the Portuguese language, but there are English subtitles included in the movie.  This movie has definitely piqued my interest in eventually checking out one of the books by Chico Xavier (sometime within the next  year). Astral City: A Spiritual Journey is best for those who like watching movies set in benevolent spirit realms. More information about the movie can be accessed from Bob Olsons AfterlifeTVdotcom website (under the November 29, 2011 article of Does Life Continue After Death).",1392854400,,1214,4.712264150943396

If you have an aversion to this kind of issue because he had a loaded spiritual formation of fear, it is also time to see this DVD. The author of this story was a semi-literate man who wrote over 400 books, all of them dictated by spiritual beings: Chico Xavier. His books are read both in and outside Brazil by people of all religions because they are not about religion as we know it. the movie shows different characters who find themselves living after death and then realize that there is an eternal life hereafter. It is beautiful and comforting. Gives a new direction in our life. You will want to give a copy of this movie to all your friends and relatives. Probably you will save one for yourself...",1391990400,2,827,4.594594594594595
4830870,5,B005LYLP8Q,"Even though this had subtitles (and I don't like nor have I ever finished past 5 minutes of subtitles) I not only watched this one entirely through....I intend to watch it at least 2 more times before I loan it to my acupuncture doctor to watch. I told her today and she's now interested to see it to.

Near the beginning there is a scene of the main character in some place...is it Hades, Hell, purgatory, where?  It is not a scene children should watch ...nor elementary children.  Teens, definitely yes. They'd probably actually love it.

Then the story goes from this dark and soul searching agonizing place of remembering where regardless the injury, there is no dying, to another place as 1 people in white clothing (not robes) come and pick up these people one at time and take them to a 'triage' sort of place inside a stone wall city.  They clean them up, and heal their wounds with just the touch of the hands in the air just above  the wound. And for medicine they are given a glass of PURE CLEAR WATER.  When the wounded and sick are better, they leave and go into the most beautiful city and housing developments I've ever seen.  And as these peoples all ages mingle in and out of their daily lives...you get to hear the conversations of one household.  A not so happy teen for being there dead, missing out on her teen years on earth, and her grandmother (whom they both remember each other) and a few other people.

I won't tell more...but it's totally worth to stop, back track along the way and read every word of the closed captions and also to take in this amazing city.  The scene on the front cover?  I don't remember that. But you'll be amazed at this city...and may even want to go there now.

I found nothing that contradicts the Bible.  And I was some years ago married to a minister for over 25 yrs....I've done my fair share of ministry. This passes the test.  I think this movie can be equally appreciated by Christians and non-church people.

Don't take my word....check it out and be prepared.  It's truly awesome.

It was initially recommended to me after getting a past life regression done and I was just blown away!!! I have become quite intrigued by not just the story but the central connection of Emmanuel, Andre Luiz, and of course Chico Xavier! I just can't get enough of this idea of the afterlife. So not only is this movie a dynamically beautiful film but it allows us in the human world to grapple with and shatter any illusions of death as the end. In fact in an odd way this movie made death even more appealing to enter the other side (I have much to do on this side so I am not rushing) but all in all I don't think a film like this could have been American made in the same way without some dominant Christian angle that would have just fell into the traditional ""Bible thumper"" type films and more than likely turned off millions.

My own hunt and peck journey has already answered many questions, and this film kind of put all that together.  It also made me think on my own journey, and how ""unconscious suicide"" is viewed.  Wanting to be gone and leave all this physical hurt is as disappointing to the soul as actual suicide.  I don't believe in hell, but I do believe we can put ourselves in dark places,this story tells us we can always reach out to God, no matter the circumstances.

Its a really touching story and you may even shed a tear at some points in  the story but its necessary viewing for any student on the spiritual path.

I didn't mind the subtitles at all, and got just as much out of the movie as if it had been in english. Now the most interesting part of this movie, is that the story was channelled through a medium.

( I am a professional medium and have had my own prime time TV show in New Zealand and have worked for  Spirit for 19 years) The beginning is a bit scary and causes some debate as the doctor in it doesn't pass smoothly through into heaven instead he goes to the astarl plane until he is reconciled sufficiently to move on. He is considered a "" suicide"" because he didn't look after his body sufficently well while he was incarnate in a physical body. The move is based on a book called Nosso Lar (Portugese for Our Home) by Frances Xavier one of Brazils most prolific medium/ writers.

In  states of altered consciousness I have personally visited some of the higher focus levels Monroe describes in his books. The film, Astral City: A Spiritual Journey, which is based on some channeled readings of another spiritual writer, accurately portrays one of these higher focus levels, the one Monroe called ""The Park,"" which souls ultimately must visit between lifetimes lived in our own three-dimensional reality, provided they don't get caught in lower vibrations because of faulty belief systems and negative choices. I found this film moving in its story line and beautiful in its filming. I've often thought if people only realized how their thoughts and beliefs rule what they experience and could shift their thinking, so much change could take place that would improve their experiences and bring them peace, healing, and renewed hope. This film offers all those things, as the viewer witnesses the grim consequences the main character must go through as a result of his faulty, egotistic belief systems before he finally asks for help, and the beauty and harmony he realizes when he learns to love others unconditionally. A superb viewing experience!",1347753600,29,1931,6.817813765182186

The life of Chico Xavier (world's most famous medium) is fantastic and it's even more interesting to know about Andre Luis's story, who is Chico's spiritual guide.
The film portraits the story of Andre Luis when he passes away, victim of his excesses in drugs and alcohol. Will he eventually find his peace of mind? It's an extraordinary spiritual journey. Worth seeing it!",1340150400,4,459,4.822784810126582

4830923,5,B005LYLP8Q,"How many of us have wondered where we come from, or why we're here or even what happens when one dies? If these are questions that have bothered you then I strongly suggest that you watch this!

Even as a spiritist, I must confess that I wasn't expecting much from this movie. My worries were soon put to rest and this is an absolutely amazing movie that gives you a glimpse of what happens after we leave this world. It is full of special effects so I'm sure that it is going to catch everyone's attention.

It is based on the best seller (and essential!) book Nosso Lar ('Our Home') psychographed by the medium Francisco C. Xavier decades ago. I think the book and the movie complete each other so if this is a subject that interests you, I recommend that you give both a try, I'm sure you won't regret it!",1338681600,2,808,4.309210526315789

4830931,4,B005LYLP8Q,"It's a beautiful movie, although a lot of patience is required, the story unfolds but not linearly. It requires thinking.  I've watched it a few times wondering, if I'm understanding the theme. It's a very well made movie. I've seen somewhat similar movies, but they were fictions. What Dreams May Come, is an example. The music by Philip Glass is appropriate.  As an individual that's heard many individuals tell about their near death experiences at Investigation Into Near Death Study Groups, the basic story line is familiar to me. The interactions of the dead with the living (and a lot of science fictions I've read, particularly Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov) made me feel there's a lot of possibilty that something close to re-occurence does happen.

Important ideas do have some 'life' in the flow of Time.  I'd never heard of Chico Xavier but there are reasons to believe he lived the life of an individual who realized that he 'was merely the hand that wrote what was dictated to him' much as William Blake wrote.

I've read a lot myself about the occult and its history as well as its banishment from the 'rational mindset'.  Also  a family member actually 'died' who was taken to another place where family members and friends who'd passed away were assembled, to assure and comfort her but send her back to a life she didn't want to live out. It was meant to be a comforting event; it was not a religious encounter but it was real to her. We paid no attention until Betty J. Eadies' book caused us to wish we'd asked more questions. Personal experience had a lot to do with the effects of the movie.

The movie made me think more about what goes on in my mind and what is 'true'. I almost missed the end credits and this thought provoking statement:  ""The process of renovation of the human life has reached the boiling point."" How to explain the many people who speak about their 'near death experiences' and write about them so convincingly unless there's some aspect of life that is the creator of such personalized events? Does the mind have the ability to retrieve images  from somewhere, of people who have lived and died then assemble a variety of them into a 'train station', where each speaks individually much as the movie depicts? Apparently it does.

It is possible to believe there is life before birth and life after death and that there is purposefulness behind every life.",1329868800,4,2406,4.664302600472813

4830934,5,B005LYLP8Q,"I read the book, and I know Brazilian Spiritism, and this movie does justice to both.
It breathes a kind of otherworldliness in the wonderful decors and also in the fairly static way of acting.
I'm not sure this is my idea of the Afterlife, but that's not important. The way this movie tells the story is visually and spiritually impressive. Allan Kardec and Chico Xavier must be pleased ...wherever they are at the moment...",1327190400,27,425,4.68
4830935,5,B005LYLP8Q,"Wow, I was really impressed by this film! It's very true to the original book/manuscript, and seems to be an accurate portrayal of the process that awaits us after physical death (that is, according to a consensus of lucid astral travelers who have visited colonies like Nosso Lar, and the crustal dimension housing the more unbalanced amongst us). The acting is excellent and nuanced, the effects are delightfully understated and avoid being overdone, and the extraphysical settings are crisp and vibrant (with the exception of Umbral, which is wonderfully creepy and unpleasant).

As an Atheist, 'deus' gets tossed around a bit much for my liking, but you expect something like that resulting from the mixture of Catholicism and Spiritism in Brazil. Overall, the inclusion of 'god' is not as intrusive as it could be and is totally non-denominational - almost coming across as Deistic. Which is something I can respect. Not every cosmic consciousness has to be pigeon-holed as some kind of intervening steward on behalf of the minutiae of the lesser-evolved denizens of the universe.

Did I mention how pleasant it is to listen to Portuguese? Subtitles are never the best case scenario, but this film makes them work. I'd much rather hear the original dialogue than risk a bad overdub.

Highly recommended.

The viewer has to pay close attention, as some of the significant explanations of life and the afterlife are almost 'throw-away' lines.
Because the author is regarded as one of the greatest Brazilians ever, the Brazilian film crew have made the film with a sacred devotion to the original story.
I must disagree with the one reviewer who longed for an English language version. If Hollywood got a hold of this i shudder to think how they would modify the storyline to accommodate the stars and insert a love interest. Yeccch!
No, this is a beautiful simple tale of one man's redemption, simply told and imaginatively recreated.
