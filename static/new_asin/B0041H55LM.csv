4242049,5,B0041H55LM,"Originally, I was not a Tyler Perry fan. His earlier movies to me seemed to portray African American families in such a stereotypically degrading way. Mr. Perry's most recent films now cast African Americans in more varying angles.

This movie stars Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates. These two ladies have honed their acting craft to perfection. Sharing the screen with them is an  amazing ensemble cast. Their acting in totality is seamless which makes the families and this story truly believable.

The script was well written. When you think you have the entire story together and gather a ""what is going to happen next is..."" expectation, you are given a surprise. This is delightful as it draws you more into their stories.

This is the first time I have seen a Tyler Perry movie where all of the actors mesh well together and the scenes flow perfectly. The only awkward scene I believe that should have been shot another way was the one with Kathy Bates in church sitting on a pew. That scene was too long. Although it was meaningful, it could have been done another way.

This movie is definitely a DVD purchase, not a rental.",1232755200,2,1130,4.686868686868687
4242050,5,B0041H55LM,"I'm a fan of Tyler Perry but until I saw this movie, I really thought his talent was limited to one genre. I had him pegged as a master playwright of gospodrama, as I call it, and a producer of dramas with a heavy emphasis on outrageous comedy. He came close to a serious drama with Why Did I Get Married, but I must admit that it wasn't a favorite of mine. I was also disappointed with Daddy's Little Girls, as I thought it was overdramatized and almost comical at parts that weren't intended to be comedic. So I went into this movie expecting more of the same - in fact, I didn't even bother to go see it in the theatre. Boy was I wrong!! From the cast to the plot, this movie was amazing.

Alice Pratt and Charlotte Cartwright are an unlikely pair that have been friends for over 30 years, when their lives become intertwined by their children's extramarital affairs. What follows is a tale of love, marriage, betrayal and family. There is drama, comedy, romance and even a little action. Kathy Bates' performance was absolutely wonderful, and Sanaa Lathan was great as a villain. Alfre Woodard was also on point, as always. The writing was great as well, my favorite line by far was from Kathy Bates, ""You are a woman scorned, without a prenup - make your demands!"" Too funny!!

This is nothing like Perry's other films. It takes him to a whole new level in my opinion. This is a movie that I can watch again and again. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1232064000,2,1453,4.397769516728625
4242051,5,B0041H55LM,"*Please Note: There May be Spoilers in My Review*

Tyler Perry has become one of my favorite actors / directors.  He seems to, ""get"" what women feel / know and what we, as humans ahould always remember, that to treat strangers with respect as they may be angels in disguise.

Charlotte ( Kathy Bates ) and Alice ( Alfre Woodard ) have been friends for over 30 years.  Charlotte is a rich woman and Alice is a middle class woman, yet their friendship has thrived for so many years.  I have to say that if Anyone is Blessed to have a friend as wonderful as Alice, God has Blessed them, cause not too many people come around like her that keep you grounded and love you no matter what.

We meet Charlotte and Alice at the wedding of Alice's daughter Andrea.  Charlotte is picking up the tab for the whole wedding, as Alice is her dear friend and Charlotte's own son decided to elope, so Charlotte can't do the whole Southern grand wedding thing for him.

I didn't like Andrea ( Alice's daughter ) at all when I first was introduced to her.  To me, she was a spoiled, spiteful woman who had major issues with Charlotte and why her mom was allowing Charlotte to pay for her wedding.  She was still dislikable through almost all the movie to me.

Charlotte's son, William Cartwright, played by, Cole Hauser, is a major leech, judging by the way his eyes undress Andrea,  Sanaa Lathan, at her wedding.  It's implied, then shown that William and Andrea become lovers, while their kind and supportive spouses know nothing about what is going on.  Andrea's husband Chris,  Rockmond Dunbar, and his brother-in-law Ben, Tyler Perry, want to start their own construction business, and Chris approaches William regarding a construction company and William can become a share holder in the new company.  William does a usual ya-da ya-da, and a, ""I will get back to your wife to get to you"" jabber and then tells Andrea that he will fire her husband which she promptly agrees to.

Meanwhile, Alice and Charlotte decide to do a spontaneous road trip west to see and do whatever they feel like seeing and doing.  You can see the special bond between the two women and the love they share, as Alice puts up with a lot of Charlotte's wild ways and spontinaity, yet manages to keep her faith and get Charlotte Baptized in the whole journey.  It is on this journey that Alice discoveres that Charlotte has early Alzheimer's and doesn't want Alice to tell anyone - especially her no good, power grubbing son.

Charlotte butts heads with her son who wants to rule the company.  She knows he isn't ready to rule, so she hires Robin Givens to help run her company, much to her son's dismay and anger. William plans a secret meeting to oust his mother as head of the company, but Charlotte  intervenes
, thanks to a forewarning by her not-so-favored daughter-in-law.

This movie has a wonderful way of making a person thankful for those that love them, for enjoying the life one has been Blessed with, and making the most of kindness to others.  This movie made me mad at Andrea and want to slap her upside the head and tell her she isn't gonna get her, ""other man"", and to listen to her mom and sister, cause they know better.  Made me appreciate the gift of my best friend and the love of my husband and how Alice's faith in God helped her every day through all her life's trials.

As with most Tyler Perry movies, I can not praise them enough for the messages and entertainment value he provides.  You'll sit and watch this to enjoy a movie, but you will also feel your heart and conscience get bigger, just like the grinch in the Dr. Suess story did.",1231977600,34,3627,4.4977099236641225
4242052,5,B0041H55LM,"Absolutely the best Tyler Perry movie ever! It's packed with real life problems, and different from every other Tyler Perry movie. He surprised me with this one, it was great. When I saw it in theaters a few month back I promised I would get it on DVD. Most movies I wouldn't even waste my money one trying to get them just to watch, but this movie is totally worth it. So that's what I did, I have it on DVD now, and I had to watch it again. Very good movie, Tyler Perry outdid his self with this one. Hope he keeps them coming!",1231977600,2,529,4.0476190476190474

4242054,5,B0041H55LM,"I have been a fan of Tyler Perry's plays and filmworks since 2004.
I own all of his plays and films and have to say that this story
which is multi-layered and rich in character is his best
output so far! He uses life lessons, a gentle sense of morality
without being judgemental and a hilarious sense of comedic
timing without being profane or disrespectful to the viewer.
Tyler has truly become a phenom in the entertainment industry
and a master storyteller.
This one and ""Why Did I Get Married"" are definitely
testimony to that fact. Definitely worth adding
to your DVD collection!",1231891200,,584,4.679611650485437

4242057,5,B0041H55LM,"First of all if you are looking for some of that over the top comic that acting that Tyler Perry has it is not your movie. I admit I don't like that type of comedy.. Medea.. etc.. not for me. So it took me a while to find out that Tyler Perry is not all about the silly acting.

I LOVED Why did I get married, and also This Christmas and Meet the Browns had its moments but this is the BEST hands down. its NOT a comedy but a serious film about family, ties, loyality and being betrayed... it is ONE of the best films I think I have ever seen...

Perry has this reputation for these comic rolls and for some reason I can't understand everytime I see one of his movies I am one of the only white people in the theater.. his movies appeal to ALL types of people.. it is easy to relate too and the acting and writing are first rate.. try this.. you won't regret.. if you don't believe me.. rent it, after that you you will want a copy of your own...

4242098,1,B0041H55LM,"Spoiler Alert....

Where do I begin?

The good...

I absolutely adore the cast. I'm a huge fan of the legendary Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard. I like Sanaa Lathan's work as well as Taraji P. Henson's. It was a pleasure to see Robin Givens, whom I haven't seen in a while. Cole Hauser also did his thing, he is very talented as well. Having said that, these characters were too stupid for their own good. It was really hard to respect any of these people.

The bad...

I was sick after watching Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) play herself for 2 hours. How dumb can you be? First of all, I'm a Black woman married to a White man, so I don't have a problem with the interracial thing. However, I do have a problem with her playing the stereotypical Black mistress to a White man with a White wife. Don't do that to us Tyler Perry, we are more than Black wh0res for White men to play around with. That's not a good look!

Anyways, she was having an affair with a multi-millionaire for a number of years and all she managed to squeeze out of him was just a little over $268,000. That's all she got! Come on now, if you're going to be a mistress to a wealthy man, at least do it right. Her apartment... NOT HERS! Her car... NOT HERS! She was naive and gullible. If you're going to cheat on your husband, why in the hell would you put the money you're getting from your lover into the same bank where you have an account with your husband? Not only that, why would you make it a joint account so he has access to the money? Who does that? No wonder she was left broke, unemployed, and living in a rundown apartment in the end. Instead of sneaking to hotel rooms every Wednesday, if she had any sense, she would have made him buy her a house if he wanted to lay and play with her. That's just the nature of the game she was playing, it's just too bad she didn't play to win. Again, she played herself and walked away with nothing to show for it. At least she could have been getting child support for her son. STUPID!!

Likewise with her husband Chris (Rockmund Dunbar). How dumb can you be to go to your boss and ask him for help to start your own business? He made himself look and sound crazy. Come on brother, the ""get rich quick"" schemes are a turn off for any woman. Not that it justifies what Andrea did, but he was just a little too dumb for my liking. How could he not know his wife was sleeping with her boss unless he was legally blind? She despised him, that was no secret. Does this mean he should have taken her money even if it didn't come from her lover? NO! He shouldn't have stolen from her. PERIOD!

Secondly, I didn't buy that Alice was a millionaire the entire time not one bit, nor did I buy that the homeless guy (Nick) was the stockbroker advising Alice the whole time either. Nick was fired while working for William for some unknown cause. However, were we supposed to believe that Alice was CHOOSING to work in a rundown diner everyday for pocket change? Were we also supposed to believe that he was CHOOSING to be homeless for no good reason? And both of these people had millions?

During the big reveal... Pam looks at Alice and asks her: ""Mom you're a millionaire, how come you never said anything?"" Alice's reply: ""You never asked!"" Oh, please... Come on now!! That was so cheesy and unbelievable! Not that it's their fault, I know they didn't write this nonsense.

Third, I liked Abby's (Robin Givens) character, but I did not buy her story either. She sits at the conference table talking about she's qualified to run the company because she has a Yale Law degree and 25 years experience. For someone who looks no older than her mid to late 30's or early 40's at the most. When did she do all that? She must have been a genius to hop pass undergrad, finish law school, and still get 25 years of work experience under her belt. As someone who has spent quite some time in school getting degrees, that just didn't seem to realistic to me. I may be wrong, it wouldn't be the first time. I just didn't find her believable!

Pam and Ben were the only two that I found somewhat tolerable. Although, Pam (Taraji P. Henson) came off as rather preachy at times. Also, let's be real, Tyler Perry may be a talented writer, producer, and Director, but he is not that great of an ACTOR. Don't get me wrong, Charlotte (Kathy Bates) is my girl, but having her kill herself so soon was just a cop-out. I got her concerns about being put away with her greedy, selfish, good-for-nothing son. It's just that one minute she was at the head of the table in a boardroom firing people. The next scene she was standing in the bathroom unhappy, depressed, and taking pills to kill herself. That felt like a rushed ending to me!! It would have been nice to see more interaction between her and Alice as far as working through her illness. After all, they were trying to sell us on this legacy of friendship they both shared. That sounds like a much better ending to me than suicide.

Overall, this movie was just filled with predictable, stereotypical, far-fetched nonsense. A good cast, mixed with some horrible acting. I was a tad confused.

Side note: Reviewers don't get your underwear into a wad. This is only my opinion. I'm only one person! I owe no apologies or explanations for my opinions. Don't agree with me, that's fine.",1480291200,,5324,4.354838709677419

4242138,3,B0041H55LM,"Plot  holes abound, but a  good movie nonetheless. Plot Hole 1: I understand William being attracted to black women in power positions. Still, Why would William Cartwright pay Andrea all that money--if she already was borderline in love with him already? In the same way he found out that Mrs. Dexter wouldn't bite, he could find out that Andrea was looking for powerful white guys. Plot Hole 2: Alice is one of the biggest Aunt Thelmas you'll ever see hiding in plain sight! She bends over backwards to appease Charlotte(putting herself in tempting situations to be friends with her), but Charlotte only half-heartedly does things when dealing with Alice. All the while, Alice is sweet and wise, though! Plot Hole 3: The End1--Maybe you could write off the homeless guy's having stock in the company to drug abuse and/or a traumatic event, but why would Alice have stock in such a booming company and be struggling financially and not cash in to help herself out?! Plot Hole 4: If Andrea really loved William and he spurned her, then wouldn't she sue for child support(was living in a lowly apartment at the end)? Questionable and possible hole: The only way that Mrs. Cartwright's death works is if it was a suicide, because I don't anybody dies of onset dementia. Despite these things, there was great acting and great chemistry! They make you overlook the flaws!",1466294400,,1366,4.833333333333333

and suddenly it started going slow motion and stopping altogether.  I took it out and started it again, the same thing
happened.  I was  going to return it.  My husband passed away on July29th and I was going through some of his
belongings and came across a small bottle with clear liguid in it.  I  read on the back of the bottle that this  was
a solution to clean CD's and DVD's so I tried it on The Family that Preys .  I cleaned it real well and put it back
in the machine,  IT WORKED.  I tried to get in touch with Amazon to tell them I would keep it, in the meantime, Ireceived
the new one that Amazon sent me.  I decided  to give the first copy to my friend, that loved it.  Since  then I have tried
from time to time to let you know that it would be okay to bill me for the one you sent but could never get in touch
to talk to anyone..  Bottom line,  PLEASE GO AHEAD AND BILL ME FOR THE DVD.  I have looked at this movie
at least 5 or 6 times since I had it.  That was really  a  good, good, movie.  Cudos to Tyler Perry.  Also, I have looked at
I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF.  Another WINNER,  The music, acting and everything about that movie is excellent.

That's my story and I am sticking to it.  (LOL).

4242441,5,B0041H55LM,"about two families, bonded by two mothers with no-good children, helping out each other materially and emotionally.  One is the matriarch of the Carthwright family who also owned the construction company, the other was a struggling small business owner.  Each of the mother had children that were bad.  Andrea resents her mother for leaving her husband and want to get out of her situation by moving up in the corporate ladder.  Likewise, William hates his mother for not turning over the company his father owned to him.  He's also a philanderer who had his sights on Andrea on her wedding day.

This is a very moving movie about the seemingly smooth families' lives unravel before your eyes.  There were clues that all is not well up before the big fight in the diner.  One just have to look for them throughout the film.

I give this movie five stars.",1396396800,,854,4.677852348993288

4242494,2,B0041H55LM,"This gets two stars because of its fabulous cast. Otherwise, it deserves only one.

Tyler Perry wants the world to know that as long as a woman is disrespectful, it is OK to hit her. And it's her loss when the two of you divorce. Mr Perry also thinks that racial insults are fine when the recipient is a black woman who is sleeping with your husband.

This movie starts well enough. I found it interesting. But, toward the end, it becomes predictable and annoying. How does a protagonist commit suicide? What's the value in that? We should have seen the two ladies enjoying their latter years instead. It would have been a much richer movie had we been shown love triumphing over Alzheimer's, IE, the women finding a creative and beautiful way to continue their friendship despite the condition.

Then there's the part where a man hits his wife and gets away with it. In fact, the woman would love to get back together with him after the divorce. Oh, and the one where a woman tells her husband's mistress that he would never be seen in public with ""someone like you."" The wife stays unhappily married to her straying husband, so, again, the woman gets the short end of the stick.

What does Tyler Perry have against women?

The Family that Preys is as cliche laden as it is predictable. Let the two who are having an affair get together and fail to stay together. That's a much better twist than making a protagonist take her own life. Let the two who are cheated on find happiness elsewhere. Because it is not always the case that the man stays with his wife. Even if it were, that angle has been used to death.

The movie did have LOL moments --- the bar scene was quite good. The cast is made up of fine actors. The script is the letdown. Why can't Tyler Perry hire amazing writers who will produce intelligent, rich work? A good cast cannot make a success of a poor script.",1388793600,2,1878,4.428985507246376

The relationships in this movie are a real truth that when u think u have to do sell yourself short just to climb the corporate ladder that it is never worth it in the long run..  Secrets always come out.  Anytime a person chases money they become greedy, unkind etc.

I LOVE Alice Evans!  However her college educated daughter who has no sense of appreciation, gratitude or idea how much she has makes me think she needs to get a good spanking. I doubt that would do any good because she thinks she is too good for her family and new husband. In the end she realizes how good her life was and that wanting things by scheming will bring nothing but heartache. There are many wonderful life lessons that are demonstrated in this movie.

4242649,1,B0041H55LM,"Bottom-Line:  Skip it!

I have never been a big Tyler Perry fan.  Millions of people are and having seen a handful of his movies and television offerings I cannot for the life of me understand why.  His offerings are often simple affairs that lack intellect, depth, and any real interest outside a certain demographic.  And yet the man makes millions of dollar peddling what amounts to modern day ""Step & Fetch It"" movies.

Tyler Perrys' ""The Family That Preys"" (2008) staring Sanaa Latham, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Rockmond Dunbar, and Taraji P. Henson does not fall far from the minstrel tree, despite its stab at the dramatic.

The Story

Written and directed by Tyler Perry (I Can Do Bad All By Myself), open on the wedding of Andrea (Sanna Lathan ~ Out of Time) and Chris (Rockmond Dunbar ~ Soul Food) being held at the home of Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates ~ Titanic), a wealthy construction business owner in Atlanta.  Charlotte is holding the wedding for the couples because she is best friends with the bride's mother Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard ~ Primal Fear).

As the story(?) progresses we learn the Andrea is an insufferable ingrate and a snob who barely loves her husband--which of course begs the question: why did she marry the man?  And she is at constant odds with her sister Pamela (Taraji P. Henson ~ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).  Andrea is also having an affair with her boss William Cartwright (Cole Hauser ~ Good Will Hunting), who is in turn married to meek Jillian Cartwright (KaDee Strickland ~ Private Practice).

Meanwhile, Andrea's husband Chris desperately wants to go into business for himself and constantly ribs Ben (Tyler Perry), husband of Pamela, about the prospect.  Eventually he speaks to William about it and as a result: he and Ben get fired, and the world upends...

My Thoughts

Admittedly, if it weren't for Tyler Perry movies, we would scare see some of the most talented Black American actors working, or trying to work, in Hollywood.  Because let face it, ""main stream"" Hollywood seems to have no place for them in its decidedly lily white world, wherein only one race has the capacity to really experience life outside of a comedy film.

So it is disappointing to this Black American reviewer that Perry's movies have thus far been the same nonsense that came before; movies starting overwhelming Black actors that have to act a fool in order to make box office dollars.  ""The Family That Preys,"" does break out of that mold by trying to offer up a dramatic turn, but fails miserably because, well, Tyler wrote it.  The story is implausible, the characters two dimensional and largely contrived along racial and gender stereotypes, and the dialog is hopeless inept and laughable at times.  It actually pained me--on the actor's behalf--to have to watch the movie.

I would have hoped by now that Perry had established enough credibility to start turning our Black American programing with depth and purpose; stories that show Black people as three dimensional being capable of exhibiting the full range of human emotion, but The Family That Preys is not that movie!

Now I love, love, love me some Sanaa  Latham, have ever since Love & Basketball, but The Family That Preys should be left off her cinematic resume!  Yes the movie is just that bad!  And as usual the antiheroes (Andrea and William) are very bad, and the good guys (Chris and Ben) are very noble and trusting (Chris)--until they--he (Chris)--gets mad and strikes his wife.

The Perry formula (preachy, pandering, gospel-laden, soap with more than an ounce of ignorance thrown in for good measure), is well worn at this point and its time Perry tried something new.  But, why should he, since his dedicated core audience comes back for more time and again!

The one good thing about The Family That Preys, other than just seeing Sanna, was Gladys Knight's soul-stirring rendition of the Lee Ann Womack classic I Hope You Dance in the closing credits, it was superb!",1311465600,5,3992,4.846607669616519

4242670,1,B0041H55LM,"I've never seen Sanaa Lathan do a worse acting job. And her husband WAS worse. And I didn't think that was possible.
These two were the central characters in this story and they didn't pull off the marriage, the marriage problems, or the big reveal. Lathan as the wife was too flatly self-centered, to the point of being evil--too much so to be remotely believable. And, the husband was too innocent and unaware to be a teenage boy much less a full grown man.

The story was worth telling, but it was told badly. Tyler Perry is NOT an expert film maker, so I usually don't critique him that hard. He's telling OUR stories with OUR music and caricatures of OUR people AND he's in a learning process going from church plays to film. But this movie was a dud, worse than a dud because...

Worse than ALL OF THIS: There is NO JUSTIFICATION for a man just hauling off and hitting a woman. I'd have had a hard time with that if the characters devolved into a fist fight. And that's not what happened. The husband (simple-minded as he was) simply becomes outraged and hits the wife. NO DICE MR PERRY.

If it happens again in another movie, learning curve or no learning curve, I'll be done with all Tyler Perry movies.",1293926400,3,1211,4.42152466367713

4242672,1,B0041H55LM,"Well at least it made the blackman look like the total victim and it justified a blackman bopping a black woman in her face!  All of the other characters were two dimensional and stereotypical, instead of one dimensional.  The Christian character, came off as mauldlin, spaced out, stupid and silly instead of comical, while traveling with her friend. What was the basis for their friendship? How would a business woman graduating at the top of her class put her cash in the bank where her husband would find it? And then leave the money in the bank after her husband found out? A woman who is gaining that kind of cash and perks from her married lover, whom is also the father of her child, would have left her never loved and repected husband, if she even ever married the poor sap in the first place, with her attitudes. And most women today wouldn't give a hill of beans if her lover left his wife or not. In fact, if she had her own career and was satified with the man, she would rather he stay with his wife, so she could maintain her independent and kept life style. ""It's cheaper to keep her"". All in all, the movie was sophomoric soap opera, about still taboo and little understood issues. Also, I didn't care for the implcation that the (SMART?) WEALTHY WHITE MATRON COMMITTED SUICIDE!!**##!!!?!? Who paid off for that wicked social engineering suggestion?  After the wealthy white matron died and left Alice her Cadillac, why did Alice close her shop and leave both her and her dead friends's mutual grandchild and and ride ofF into the sunset: to do what, stick cash into men's drawers?

I certainly don't begrudge Tyler Perry's great success. I enjoyed the stage version of Madea's Family Reunion. I do believe that play was a gift from God. However, this movie didn't edify me one bit. This movie may have even been damaging to the understanding of real social/sexual politics between black men and woman as well as in interacial relationships today. This film presented no good examples of Christian, Mother or Friend. If Alice really loved her friend who made her a wealthy woman to boot, she would have vowed to take care of her, herself, until her friend's dying day. Not just say ""I'ts gon be alright"" but assure her that she was going to make it alright with real love, care and dignity, honor and respect for her friend's LIFE. They could have traveled with medical help and enjoyed their mutual grandchild together (what a gift between women) until it was time for her friend to die. That's a true CHRISTIAN friend!

4242684,5,B0041H55LM,"It's true Kathy Bates is one of my favorite actresses ever, but the main reason the Family That Preys is so good is actually not so much about Kathy Bates but moreso because of the *rest* of the characters and storyline.

It's one of those storylines where, if you can find a way to pay attention to the first 30 minutes (which is definitely on the dull side) the rest of the storyline will gradually improve more and more all the way to the conclusion, which is where all the events you witness during the first half unravel and make sense.

It's actually a carefully written and well-executed storyline.  Whoever wrote this storyline did a magnificent job, seriously.

Without spoiling anything, the story is about several family members and friends who go through many personal problems involving significant business decisions, relationship troubles, and Kathy Bates character getting an urge to travel around the country with her friend, see the sights and just enjoy life.

What makes the storyline so memorable is, once again, the way everything ties together by the end.

Another interesting thing about the storyline is how it's actually a perfect blend of comedy and drama, not to mention plenty of noticeably tense and sad moments.  Implementing all these emotions would have been good enough to give the movie a high grade- the fact the storyline is so cleverly written just makes it that much better.

While the supporting actors did not have ""stellar"" performances, the plot and the acting by Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard make this a MUST SEE movie.  I only gave it four stars, because I did not agree with some of the outcomes (not nearly as much as I disagreed with some of the outcomes of Why Did I Get Married Too [that plot line was HOT GARBAGE]). The real stars of this movie are the veteran, professional trained actors, but I always like to see TP without any makeup or costumes, because he does seems to have A LOT of unexplored depth as a dramatic actor.  Plus, he always comes off as super masculine/strong/sensitive/intelligent and caring whenever he's playing a regular character.  This is a work that was largely ignored, because TP is considered camp vs. cinema in Hollywood. But who cares what Hollywood thinks?

You get people - with all the warts and needs that people so often come with -  human beings with issues that hold claim to no class or social distinctions.  Tyler Perry seemed to bring the two together in this film, bringing one up a notch and one down, or, maybe showing that there are no such distinctions when it comes to the human drama and that they were on the same level all along.

I can not praise this film enough.  It truly, truly blew me away, and when it was over I felt slightly changed.  Having been smitten with Tyler Perry since I saw a DVD of his stage play 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman', this film was a departure from his normal poignant humor and delivered a burst of the brilliant filmmaker he is fast becoming.

Wonderful story and superb performances by the lovely Alfre Woodward and the solid Kathy Bates. They had a wonderful chemistry, and I really enjoyed their scenes together. Tyler Perry has a gift for keeping his stories real and heartfelt, and always throws wonderful nuggets of wisdom and truth in his movies.
Alfre Woodward's character was a beautiful example of a woman with a true Christian heart. No hypocrisy, and her scenes rebuking with the holy oil and the bible were laugh out loud funny. The acting was top notch by all the performers ( Robin Givens gives a fine performance as well, I always think she is unfairly judged.) The story is one that deals with real issues that face us as flawed human beings. I look forward to more of Tyler Perry's work in the future. For the most part his movies become better and better as he grows in his work. In this society that hails so many out and out stupid movies as genius, this is a TRUE gem that does not need to resort to excessive violence, sex, cursing because it is of such high quality.",1268092800,4,1164,4.469483568075117

4242721,5,B0041H55LM,"Because it is also pretty obvious he's putting out exactly the type of superficial movies that will not stand up to any amount of incisive consideration but will appeal to his targeted audience. Granted, compared to the majority of his movies that I have seen, this one is probably the best of a mediocre mix, but that doesn't make it worthwhile.

This time out, you have two family matriarchs, portrayed by two very talented actors, Alfre Woodward and Kathy Bates, from appreciatively distinct social, cultural and economic backgrounds who have nevertheless forged what appears to be a committed friendship over nearly 30 years.  Alice, Woodward's character is the `salt of the earth,' deeply religious, forgiving and non-judgmental which is fortunate since she is also the mother of a manipulative, self-absorbed thirty-something daughter (Sanaa Lathan) who is willing to do whatever she deems necessary to achieve her aspirations of upward mobility, including emasculation of her ambitious but patently nave husband (Rockmond Dunbar) by entering into an adulterous relationship with her employer (Cole Hauser) who conveniently also happens to be the back-stabbing, self-serving son of  Bates' character, Charlotte.

It is feasible that Perry intended to subtly comment on historical objectification of Black women by white oppressors because Cartwright, at his lecherous best also shows more than passing interest in Robin Given's character, a no nonsense COO brought into the company by his mother as direct threat to her son's quest to usurp the corporate chairperson position, but that's way more credit than I am willing to proffer.

Also in the recipe there are the strong-willed, family oriented yet curiously childless other Woodward daughter (Taraji P. Henson), wife of the grounded, dedicated hard-working, secure in life, Ben (Tyler Perry), and the introverted, non-confrontational wife (KaDee Strickland) of  Houser's character... and a homeless guy. It is made clear Charlotte doesn't trust or conceivably even like her son and she has no use for her ex-trailer trash parvenu daughter-in-law. It's a mystery to me why these two women, (Charlotte and Alice) are friends because although how they met is eventually brought to light, the friendship does not appear to have been particularly deep or reciprocal. Alice seems to know a great deal about Charlotte and her travails in life but at the same time, Charlotte isn't even aware Alice is a teetotaler.

Those factors and many others are revealed during  the girl buddy road trip Charlotte convinces Alice to take with her in a classic Coupe Deville, leaving the foibles of the homefront to take care of themselves, one of which is the nave husband trying to get funding from his employer (and his wife's lover) to start his own construction company, when it seems to me, unless one was cognizant of his spouse's intimacy with the potential benefactor, playing upon his mother-in-law's relationship with Charlotte, the actual owner of corporation, would have been a better course of action, or maybe applying for an SBA loan. I'm not even going to address why Lathan's character who clearly had little respect for her husband and is supposed to be a financial expert would choose to place her slush fund in a joint account. Those are at the bottom of the this doesn't make sense totem pole but to mention the more confounding issues would probably constitute spoilers.

In the end, this is a typical Perry movie. If his work has entertained in the past or if you're looking for a movie with an ostensibly uplifting message that in reality will not survive any contemplative scrutiny, you're in the right place. So, my five star rating is measured against other Perry films, not a wide range of films of similar plotlines, where my real assessment would be two stars.",1248480000,,3832,5.147909967845659

4242741,4,B0041H55LM,"I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the theater and then bought it when it came on DVD. While this was a very good movie, I feel ""Why Did I Get Married"" was much better. Tyler Perry's dramatic movies are more enjoyable because they do not contain the usual stereotypes that his comedies contained, i.e. Madea. I agree with a lot of the reviews that Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates were both excellent in this movie.

I really didn't like Sanaa Latham playing the villianess, I would have preferred Robin Givens in that role. I really felt bad for Andrea's husband Chris. I think TP portrayed him as too weak and too apologhetic when he had nothing to apologize for. Now that I think about it, the women characters were much stronger than the men characters. I'm so glad that Andrea was left with nothing for all her misdeeds. Her mother was right, ""You can't make yourself happy bringing misery to other people""",1238630400,,914,4.539393939393939

There is no Madae in this film but Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard clearly make up for this as two strong women trying to hold their families together through thick and thin.
This movie chronicles four years of the families of two women who appear to have nothing in common. Charlotte(Kathy Bates) is the owner of a multi million dollar family owned business whose son went to Harvard.
Alice (Alfre Woodard) ""broke her back"" in a greasy spoon diner in order to keep food on the table after her husband abandoned her. Her daughters had to marry military men in order to help ""escape the ghetto"".

When the two women decide to take a road trip, they find out that they have far more in common than any two women ever could. Charlotte learns how to be ""rich"" with the help of Alice and vice versa and it is eventually Alice who saves Charlotte from financial ruin.",1238371200,,982,4.579545454545454
4242743,3,B0041H55LM,"I soooo anticipated this movie, and soooo wanted to love it, being that it features two of my all-time favorite actors: Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates.  How excited I became when I saw that they were working together in a film!  But alas, this is not the film that allows them to work their magic.

Unfortunately, ""The Family That Preys"" has so much dumbed-down dialogue, that I felt writer/director Tyler Perry must have decided that if the country's newspapers have to be written on a sixth-grade level, then so must movies in order to gather the widest appeal.  Perry wastes a great deal of dialogue having his characters explain their relationships in no uncertain terms - a perennial sign of bad writing, churning out throw-away lines like, ""You two are sisters!""  ""You're my husband!"" - instead of writing interesting dialogue that reveals the relationship in other ways.  I found myself being embarrassed for the ultra-talented cast, seeing them all working so hard, having been given such vapid lines and cliches.

And what follows IS clich after clich, both verbally and visually, seeming to never end.  To instill instant sentimentality and create familiarity, Perry counts on references to some of our favorite films, even recreating The Whistlestop Caf, replete with a reference to fried green tomatoes and a visit from Ol' Smokey Lonesome.  Perry also wants us to know that Charlotte and Alice are out chasing a wild hare, crossing the country just like ""Oprah and Gayle"" or ""Thelma and Louise"" -- just in case we can't make that connection for ourselves.  At one point when a particular character slaps another and sends her reeling over the diner counter, I felt like I was watching an old Bonanza episode.  I expected a player piano to suddenly crank up and a saloon fight to ensue, and the (original) Cartwrights to walk through the door, just in time to save the day.

The scenes of power play, greed, and betrayal seem like script rejects from the 80's TV show ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty.""  And while I never watched those shows, the commercials back then were enough to make viewing these scenes feel like I had seen it all before.

I've not seen any of Perry's other films.  The ""Madea"" comedies look like simple fun, and this dramatic disappointment won't keep me from checking them out for (hopefully) a good belly larf.

In the meantime, I'll keep waiting for the vehicle that will allow Alfre Woodard to take home that much-deserved Oscar -- which she should have captured twice by now, in ""Passion Fish"" and ""Miss Firecracker""!  Keep a-workin', girl!",1237939200,3,2569,4.86896551724138

I love the acting in it, and the storyline was the best Tyler Perry I had seen so far. I like all his movies, but a few of his movies are a little too predictable for me. This one had several themes, one of which was just the unlikely friendship between women through time. The other themes about greed, jealousy and relationships was good also, but the friendship theme overrode and was the best of the whole movie. Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard are great, and so are the rest of the actors. I think the most intereting thing is that the subject of race, interracial relationships or anything of the like is never mentioned in the movie, and that is why this movie is so good. Its not overdone. Its just right.",1237680000,,831,4.232704402515723
4242756,5,B0041H55LM,"THE FAMILY THAT PREYS

I have to say that I am a big fan of Tyler Perry and all of his work from the plays to films I like what the man does. It seems that he just keeps getting better as his film making abilities progress with every one. Some I like more than others but every one has been outstanding, to me Tyler writes people not characters and that is the best complement I can give. So needless to say I was excited to hear that my favorite actress Kathy Bates was doing a film with him, and it got better when I learned that Alfre Woodard was in it.

The film is about two best friends Charlotte Cartwright [Bates] & Alice Pratt [Woodard] who both live very different lives but it is those lives that have made them the friends they are today. Both have kids each having their own problems whether it be with money or marriages yet they all seem to be connected and not just because of the mothers being friends. So in order to get away from it all they both get together and travel across America for one last good time together, because like Charlotte says ""are you living or existing"". In the mean time Alice's two daughters are trying to deal with each and their husbands at the same time. One has an ambitious husband who just wants to catch a break and the other has a husband who is content on were he is in life while wants more. As far as Charlotte's child goes he is busy scheming and planning on getting his mother dropped from the company. A company in which she has made one of the best in the world and has the controlling vote, unless he can trick her out of it.

Tyler Perry has crafted another hit in my mind and has created one of my favorite films to come out these last couple of years. His script is full of wonderful and interesting characters some are more likable than others but all are entertaining. His direction seems crisp as ever as the pace moves along nicely never staying to long on any one scene, but all play out smooth and don't go to quick. Perry is excellent in his role as Ben as well the content husband of Pam played wonderfully by one of the best actresses alive Taraji Henson. Perry comes across as the every man who is just trying to get by in life and feed his family and Taraji is perfect as the supportive wife who just wants her husband to want more in life.

Kathy Bates as always is magnificent as Charlotte Cartwright the millionaire or is it billionaire, whatever she is she is excellent. She pulls off the character nicely and the scenes between her and Alfre Woodard are excellent especially when her disease starts to get to her. And Alfre Woodard is marvelous as Alice Pratt the the best friend who came from a whole other world but befriended who should have been an enemy, there is a nice surprise in the end. Sanaa Lathan is one of the best in the film as Andrea the wicked sister of Pam or at least in Pam's eyes. She is cold and calculating in this film and knocks it out of the park. Rockmond Dunbar plays her ambitious husband Chris and much like the rest of the cast is nothing short of great. He just seems like a genuinely nice guy although a lot of people seem to be upset with something that happens with him [more on that latter]. Cole Hauser plays possibly the most entertaining character as Charlotte's son William since he plays the character so evil. And KaDee Strickland is great as his wife Jillian as is Robin Givens as Abby. Another superb stand out is Sebastian Siegel playing Nick, excellent character here.

Now as far as the little thing that every one seems up set about I must say just get over, it is a movie and that is the character. I certainly don't agree with ever striking a woman no matter what the reason and don't agree with him doing it. But his character was pushed to the edge with what she had done to him and that was the only way that character knew how to respond. Although he was wrong for just taking the money even though they were married. I really think that it added a nice element of drama to the scene and made them seem more real. There are plenty of real life situations that ended just like that and I think that is all it was, just a scene from real life because like I said Tyler writes people not characters in these kinds of films. I mean come on it is really a drama you should expect things like that, you don't go see a Slasher flick and then say ""THAT WAS SO RUDE OF HIM TO STAB HER IN THE SHOWER, HE COULDN'T WAIT""

This is an excellent movie that is worthy of any DVD collection in my opinion, I am a proud owner of it. At the very least it is a very entertaining film about people, and real people at that. I think you should buy this and skip a rental it is definitely worth shelling out for.",1237507200,,4722,4.2236987818383165

After watching why did I get married, I figured I would give this a try as well and I was not dissapointed. My favorite parts of the movie is watching the interactions between the two great actresses Alfrie Woodard and Kathy Bates. All of Kathy's scenes were stellar.

The love triangle piece of the film was often times unrealistic in how dumb and niave the husband of Sanai Lathan's character was. After the wedding I never witnessed any emotional or physical interaction between the Sanai Lathan Character and  her husband. A woman walking into the house barely acknowleging that the husband is there w/ each interaction- not even a hello.

The less obnoxious of the two daughters, Pam, is bitter. Andrea is all out selfish and disrespectful of all including her marriage, husband, mother, sister and anyone who crosses her path. Tyler Perry plays a common sense and kind character who is an asset to the families.

The mothers, nearly lifelong friends, are the bright spot in the film. A few pleasant surprises and some unpleasant ones make for a satisfying end, not necessarily happy, but satisfying. Good acting and honest consequences make the movie a good conversation starter for older teens. Drama and materialism isn't necessarily the secret of a successful life. A good think piece for adults as well. The PG-13 rating is appropriate.",1234396800,4,1169,5.051813471502591

4242776,5,B0041H55LM,"I've seen a couple of Perry's movies (Why did I get Married and Diary of a Mad Black Women) and although they were good, I wasn't what you call a fan. I watched The Family That Preys yesterday and was soooo surprised! This movie was FANTASTIC! As another reviewer said, the scenes were seamless, the actors and storyline were believable. The dialogue was superb!!! Especially Cathy Bates and Alfre Woodard! The surprise twists just kept coming. Keep this up Mr. Perry and I might become a fan!!! Wonderful movie!",1233705600,,512,4.764044943820225
4242777,5,B0041H55LM,"This is definitely Tyler's best movie so far. Great casting!

Alfre Woodard is fantastic and Kathy Bates is, well ... KATHY BATES.

The best part of the film comes when Kathy's character (Mrs. Cartwright)is confronted by her son (played magnificently by Cole Hauser) when asked by her son if she trusts him. Kathy replies, ""...It's NOT that I don't trust you, my dear, it's your private thoughts that make me pause.""

What a GREAT line! (I screamed!)",1233619200,,450,4.818181818181818

4242779,5,B0041H55LM,"I watched this movie over the weekend and loved it enough to write a review.  Kathy Bates is an amazing actress and this role is one she sunk her teeth into.  I was taken by the how multifacted she made the character Charlotte.  She was so kind an loving to her best friend, Alice, and, yet, absolutely ruthless with her son, who by the way, deserved every bit of her wrath.  Alfre Woodard is always stellar.  She can say more with her eyes than most actresses can convey by speaking.  The supporting cast was fabulous as well. Sanaa Lathan was downright scary in her ruthlessness. Loved it. Besides the line, ""Where's Morgan Freeman?"" which was hysterical in its context, my favorite line was from Alice when she said that she gave the first part of her life to everyone else and now she was going to keep the rest for herself.  I think that a lot of women will relate to that.  Oh, and Gladys Knight putting some soul to the song ""I Hope You Dance"" sealed the deal for me. I actually listened to that twice.  I hope that I can find a recording of it somewhere.",1233532800,,1062,4.3232323232323235
4242780,4,B0041H55LM,"A pretty good movie. I am not sure if Tyler Perry is trying to make a point or point out something or just really making a really good drama.

Charlotte and Alice  are really good friends with each other and not their children. The children are the ones that are preying on each other. There is a lot of drama.(Alice gives a lot of good advice. I am jotting them down in my mind as I am typing.)",1233360000,,395,4.051282051282051

4242783,5,B0041H55LM,"I had to go back two times at the beginning of the movie to see the wedding that everyone came to see, but realized that was a scene that was apparently edited out of the final cut.  I think that out of all of the Tyler Perry Movies that I have seen, this is the first that does not ""Beat"" women down.  Alice's daughter brought her mishaps on herself and deserved everything that she got.  The movie does have smooth transitions into each drama-episode and is extremely clean.  One thing that I couldn't figure out, is why Tyler Perry wore padding under his clothing, to make himself look like an over weight ""Couch Potatoe"".",1233100800,,625,4.456140350877193
