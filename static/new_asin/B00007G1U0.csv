7975890,2,B00007G1U0,"I recently watched this film, and while I did get a chuckle in a couple of spots I found it mostly ridiculous... but not in the funny way.  Perhaps I am not the intended audience and I can admit that, or maybe it's because I am watching it so long after it came out.  If you like over the top premises and absurdity and female prison films, go for it.  I don't think I'll be watching it again, but don't take that as meaning ""I hated it"".",1343433600,,438,4.011494252873563

7975894,4,B00007G1U0,"I actually rented this movie, and from seeing who was in the movie caught my curiousity. Now i have seen other movies on curiousity as well and many i have regretted. But, this one wasn't bad at all. It takes a couple of spoofs on ""Pulp Fiction""
and has the same feel, but with a ghetto twist on it. And at times the story is very unbelievable, where you would probably say they should have done this with that character instead of what the director, and screenwriter did with some of the characters. But, what do you expect for a straight to video release. 9 times out of 10 these end up being the best movies. So i try t keep an open mind and give new, unheard movies a chance. You may never know.",1043971200,9,699,4.185185185185185
