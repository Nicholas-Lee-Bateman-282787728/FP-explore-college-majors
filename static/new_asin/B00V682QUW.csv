8709395,5,B00V682QUW,"An outstanding movie based on a true story. Much of the movie revolved around the gang culture that exists in New Zealand and how difficult it is to break away from it. Another central theme is the difficult life of the people afflicted with mental illness. The lead character suffers from severe bipolar disorder but manages to achieve greatness despite the challenges both his illness and his environment present. The accents are at times strong but true to the story. A heroic movie with excellent acting and direction. It won every award for a movie in New Zealand, best actor, best director, best movie etc.",1472515200,6,612,4.838095238095238
