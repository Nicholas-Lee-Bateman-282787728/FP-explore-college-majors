6123210,5,B00GX33J7E,"Slavoj Zizek's continues his ""Pervert's Guide"" series, the first one being the Perverts Guide to Cinema back in 2006. Contrary to that film, which is also very interesting and thought provoking, there is no need for some background in psychoanalysis of the Lacanian variety.

Instead of focusing on how films can be a useful tool in understanding how the much discredited psychoanalysis can be, Zizek focuses on an topic that has been dormant for a long time, since the collapse of the USSR, namely the issue of Ideology. By going through obscure films like John Carpenter's ""They Live"", to use the metaphor of glasses revealing the truth in daily illusion, to talking about the much acclaimed Batman's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the hidden message that can be interpreted as to why in political discourse, authority is de facto needed to control the masses who will become violent and brutal without leaders, according to those who have such authority. Zizek is here to claim that a movie is never really a movie, to different extents all we see and watch in our daily lives, not only movies but media and historical events, all have an underlying Ideological mechanism at work.

While there are certainly some objections that some of these interpretations are trivial or seek to stretch a movie too much out of its context, it is hard to deny having seen this movie, that given a different angle a wild new world of possibilities is opened up that can serve to enrich our understanding of things we often take for granted, albeit with some nagging suspicions that something is not right. What is this something which is not correct? There is no simple answer and each individual can and may well bring their own understanding of all that is popular and of mass consumption.

The one instance in which Zizek does make an explicit Lacanian term (which, to my mind is not bad, Zizek is a Lacanian, and even if you think Lacan was a charlatan, this is Zizek's Lacan, so take it for what it is) is when he mentions the Big Other. This is a difficult concept to explain, but can be understood as a fictitious entity that we postulate into another larger moral agent which we believe is external to us, but nevertheless is actually within us. If you don't understand this concept, watch the movie and maybe it will begin to make sense.

Even if you conclude that much of this is wrong, it is impossible to deny that there is plenty of food for thought contained in this excellent documentary, one which makes you think, and does not preach. Was Jesus an Atheist? Is Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" a celebration of our humanity? Is the Church actually a secretly permissive society? Do prostitutes need to be rescued? Does military vulgarity serve a deeper purpose? Do we really want what we desire? Go ahead and do what the popular carbonated beverage tells you to do in its many commercial: Enjoy!",1395705600,5,2888,4.712871287128713
6123211,5,B00GX33J7E,"This is not to say Zizek provides a clear or easy message, and to my lay understanding he appears to jump around quite a bit without and easy roadmap. Strangely this neither interfered with my simple enjoyment of his amusing subjects for deep analysis, his perhaps unintentional sense of comic timing, or his truly engaging constructions of the subtle cues in superficial trends of society.

No, this wasn't an epiphany of the sort you can easily explain to others. But where Zizek shines for me is in each individual example. Most of them ring true in a way that you can feel broadening your perspective on THAT particular example. And while his examples didn't really add up to a big WOW for me at the end of the film, I'm not sure critical theorists even aim for that, as their ""answer"" could be taken for propaganda and clutched as""truth"" like any other message of propaganda.

Maybe I'm too dim to see the big picture behind critical theorists like Zizek, Benjamin, and Derrida, but I feel delightfully challenged by their efforts, one by one, and feel that this movie reminded me to look beneath the obvious message of pop culture iconography and idealism for more subtle dynamics of control and subversion.

Don't be scared off by any of this as the opening segment praises the 1988 John Carpenter movie, ""THEY LIVE"" for it's astute critique on consumer culture. And he's right! I can't wait to dig up this old film as it appears to be excellent social satire made palatable with a monster movie approach.

Look, if you're a PhD student this might be too remedial or lightweight for you to use for your thesis, but as a layman who seeks out new philosophical ideas to expand my perception of the world, I loved it.

I don't want the answer Zizek doesn't provide; I want new tools to peel the onion of existence back a layer or two and figure out more from there. I was not let down.

Highly recommended.",1394755200,35,1910,4.602941176470588

6123214,4,B00GX33J7E,"Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and director Sophie Fiennes, who collaborated on The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, join forces once again for a rambling meditation on film and pop culture in The Pervert's Guide to Ideology.

It's a hilarious treatise on how Hollywood expresses important cultural political ideals through how characters move through plots, and the discussion is fast, funny, and furious. It is a thinking man's treatise on cinema, and what's fun is they are using populist pieces rather than underground cinema that often has its own political agenda on display. No long looks at My Dinner with Andre, rather here we have analysis of the big summer blockbusters on what they do to our state of mind, psychoanalysis, and dreams.

DVD is a great way to experience this film, especially with a booklet that provides references to the films as well as statements from the director and production notes. Also included as an extra feature is a half-hour discussion with Sophie and Slavoj at a museum screening, which serves to explain the genesis of the project as well as provide more rants and raves. The visual presentation from HD elements is fine, although often the quality is dependent on the age of a film they are talking about. This is a talking-head-interspersed-with-clips kind of affair. Sound is a simple English stereo with subtitles for those who are hard of hearing or have difficulty following the stream-of-thought Slovenian shouting off the screen at them. The DVD is a great presentation, and even a step-up from the museum screenings that most people attended to first see this movie.

The Pervert's Guide to Ideology is a smart and playful ride that explores cinema and culture through unlikely avenues. It's a film that asks you to consider They Live as a masterpiece of ideological meditation. It is John Carpenter's statement about dictatorship through democracy and also a savvy update of Invasion of the Body Snatchers that has a firm grasp of propaganda. That's just something that is thrown out in the first three minutes of the film which runs over two hours on Slavoj's caffeine-fueled rants. He examines American life through our ultimate expression, the collective dreams we call movies.

6123215,3,B00GX33J7E,"This guy clearly has some brilliant thoughts and theories -- if only he could present them in a more organized way.  His thick accent notwithstanding, this film was enjoyable but difficult to follow (I say that as someone with immense education, who speaks 6 languages, and who watches and reads challenging material all the time).  It suffered from a lack of cohesive presentation, jumpy editing, and other distractions including but not limited to his CONSTANT touching of his nose and face (the way that a cocaine addict would do.  It was pervasive and distracting enough to mention.  Really.).

6123230,4,B00GX33J7E,"Zizek has a lot to say about the meaning of life, or to put it a bit more psychologically the meanings of our lives, and why and how we might entrust others (or what he oddly calls a ""Big Other"") to provide that meaning to us. Obviously he's going to be wrong some of the time, but as an adult you just have to accept that. His ideas remain extremely entertaining and fun to think about, which is the purpose of watching all these movie clips and visual effects, rather than just reading one of his books.

Some of his remarks are spot on and should be delightful to most viewers -- for example, his discussion of Ode to Joy and its role in Clockwork Orange, as well as Coke advertisements. Other remarks, especially towards the end of the movie, were not really comprehensible to me, and he was jumping around a bit too fast for me to understand. And of course there is his obsession with the term ""capitalism"", which unsurprisingly becomes more all-encompassing as he applies it to more and more things. But the viewer should watch this with some sympathy, for as Zizek possibly understands, the pleasure of overcoming one's resistance to leaving the comfortable confines of one's own ideology is superior to the pleasure of shutting out all resistance to that ideology. All in all, this is a good film to rent at least, if you like actual critical theory instead of faux critical theory.",1442793600,5,1390,4.582329317269076

6123234,4,B00GX33J7E,"I wanted to see this film because Zizek is quoted more and more often in books I review.  I wanted to see who he is. He is a twitchy philosopher and political scientist with a lot to say.  What is most interesting is that he frames his philosophy in popular films from all over. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of films, and extracts the points he wants to make from the unlikeliest of them. It makes his theories instantly relevant, possible and palatable, and keeps you in your seat. You never know what's coming next.

Most entertaining is Zizek putting himself in recreated sets of the films he uses as examples, in costume. He appears in Jaws, Titanic, Seconds, Dark Knight, West Side Story, Taxi, Sound of Music and numerous others that he employs to dismantle the foundations of modern society. He shows the undermining of justice, of authority, of religion, of The Big Other - and uses them to show that they actually demonstrate the very opposite of what they appear to stand for. That's an accomplishment.

There is plenty to disagree with. Zizek comes up with a theory that love and couples are incidental to the stories in films. But there would be no film industry without the love interest, the struggle to consummate a relationship, the sacrifice, the betrayal, and all the other mechanisms that make film stories attractive to audiences. You almost want to stop the film and call him up and say - how can you say that?

It is a long film that covers a lot of territory. But it covers it entertainingly on several levels: the explanation from within the set, the clips from the films themselves, and the linking of them to make his points. If this lecture were a book, the pages would be soaked with highlighter.

6123238,2,B00GX33J7E,"I rented this after hearing my favorite podcaster, comedian and social critic Duncan Trussell recommend it on one of his podcasts.  I feel I am a pretty intelligent guy, but I just could not wrap my head around the points Slavoj Zizek made in this (documentary?) film.  It was well-crafted at least.  I thought it was cool how the production team reproduced scenes from the various movies Zizek used as examples, and then placed him in those scenes.  It was pretty effective.  That said, he lost me after the first scene from whatever movie that was where the characters donned special glasses that enabled them to see (on billboards, magazine ads, etc.) what the true, hidden messages are behind those ads.  If you watched it too and didn't feel you understood it afterwards, don't feel bad.  If you know of anyone who read James Joyce's Ulysses, Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow or anything by William S. Burroughs and then claimed that they understood them, they are probably full of crap.  I didn't understand any of those, and I didn't understand most of this movie either.",1410307200,5,1073,4.825136612021858
6123239,5,B00GX33J7E,"Nice examination of all topics included in this film. I like how Slavoj uses metaphors that are visual at times. In my condition,  his metaphors are easy to retain. 2 words that I must say, MUST SEE.",1409097600,,199,4.378378378378378

6123241,5,B00GX33J7E,The Pervert's Guide is a brilliant introduction into what ideology is all about. Ideology does not corrupt the mind into a state of false consciousness but is the condition of consciousness itself. Zizek explains the impact and the consequences of this insight in a broad scale of very different movies and their narratives.,1405555200,,324,5.132075471698113
6123242,5,B00GX33J7E,"This is a fascinating and transformational look into ideology through the prism of popular culture. You don't have to agree with the arguments, and I often didn't, in order to find insight from these views. I found it highly enjoyable and insightful.

Also, closed captioning is a great idea, as Zizek's accent and pacing, though gripping, are sometimes hard to follow.",1404604800,,369,5.049180327868853
6123243,3,B00GX33J7E,"Spoiler alert.  An example of ideology Zizek refers too is how when Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) cannot climb on the raft with Rose (Kate Winslet) in the 1997 movie Titanic. While floating on a piece of wooden furniture she's says, ""I'll never let go, I promise""- and then ironically lets his body sink into the ocean! Zizek claims this reflects an ideology that says upper class people can exploit the creativity of lower class individuals and then dispose of them- but this ignores another, although perhaps no less disturbing, biological interpretation (a little strange given the title of ""Pervert's guide"")- low social status and high social status individuals should be free to choose each other as sexual partners (and possible reproductive partners) and also abandon them. Which is really the ""deeper"" or more resonant message? Perhaps Jack is disposable simply because he is a male, and not specifically because he is a lower-class male.  ;)
Certainly the floating scene makes it a challenge to accept the ""love story"" on it's face.  For example, why couldn't Rose and Jack take turns swimming/resting on the wooden float? Why didn't Cameron make the it big enough for both of them? Is their affair so fated for doom and disaster that one HAD to die for a satisfactory ending?
There's a lot more to be said about Zizek's analysis of Hollywood films, but this one small example should indicate whether you have an inclination to patiently listen to what Zizek has to say here. Given the choice, I would definitely get Closed Captioning. Along with a thick accent, Zizek has challenges as an orator.",1404000000,4,1602,4.947955390334572

Film critics, even the best, generally ignore these dimensions. This time Zizek is also covering other art forms such as music. His comment on Rammstein's ridiculous nazi aesthetics is spot on.

His character is zany as always and his obscure sense of humor still there. I was particularly enthralled by his review of the 'put the glasses on' fight scene in 'They Live'. I always thought it incredibly long and weirdly repetitive, literally trashy. Zizek's semiotics gave me a different angle behind the meta scene.",1399766400,,742,5.132231404958677

But, like a film you can at least sit through because if nothing else it holds your attention, THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO IDEOLOGY kept me viewing even though much of what it said got past me, some of it the host's accent, most of it the brainy subject matter.
