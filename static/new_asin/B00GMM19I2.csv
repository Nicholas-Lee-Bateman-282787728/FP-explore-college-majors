8624683,3,B00GMM19I2,"In late 2013, there was a comet the size of Manhattan coming close to the sun.  The program is excited about this because we can study the phenomenon more than ever before.  Plus, we are not afraid of comets like people were centuries ago.  This comet Ison is going to pass by and not come back.  This is different from other comets that move in circles or ovals like planets.  The program does bring up Newton and even Haley.  The Heaven's Gate cult also comes up.  Still, this program came on in late 2013 when comet Ison is coming.  However, it may have passed by now and maybe there will be less interest as viewers think each day this comet is moving farther away from us.  Think about when you start to hear a doppelganger less and less.  This would be a great item to show in pre-college science classes.  I would give this two stars, but I don't want to say I disliked this.  It's just not one for the ages, although it is nice enough.",1394928000,,943,4.265536723163842
