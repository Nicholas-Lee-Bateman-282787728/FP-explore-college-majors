1202344,4,B00000F3XU,"I had a great deal of fun with this video. I rented in on VHS, and am now buying it (DVD for the soundtrack control). I watched the film twice over, and caught so many more things the second time than the first. The first part of the viewing you spend trying to figure out how all these characters connect to each other, and then you relax into the flow of them popping in and out of various corners of the screen. Amazing timing ...just Amazing timing for one-take. Julian Sands' entire purpose in the film seems to be to distract the other actors and see if they get lost. This makes his background-character entertaining. I found myself backing the film up several times in certain places because as I was paying attension one thing, I suddenly realized the scene was slowly changing in another corner and I was like ""wait a minute...what's happening over _there_..?"". Over-all, the four simultanious corners of action are not that hard to follow. Mike Figgis uses sound to take you every place you need to go to figure out what is happening.  I found the performances of Jeanne Tripplehorn and Saffron Burrows particulary well done. Both are on screen through most of the film and keep up character perfectly.  Not a film for people who do not like to use their mind while watching. Mike Figgis does not spoon-feed his viewers (thank you). All in all very inventive and well done !",980121600,4,1385,4.580645161290323
1202345,1,B00000F3XU,"Sure, it's very innovative:  4 screens all at once, no editing, and one take.  Unfortunately, not all original ideas should see the light of day.  This movie has basically no story, it is just a 90 minute long take of 4 different cameras.  THAT'S ALL.  There is not a compelling enough storyline to keep a sane viewer engaged.  Thankfully the volume is brought up on the important shot that the director wants us to watch, but that doesn't save this mess.  I don't understand what people see in this movie besides it's originality.  Just because an idea is new, does not mean it's a good one.
This is just one big mess, and one of the most ANNOYING AND FRUSTRATING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN.",978998400,3,687,4.483870967741935
1202346,4,B00000F3XU,"Yes, I generally agree. I watched the whole thing through first and enjoyed the novelty, although felt rather overwhelmed by it. The plot is rather insignificant; definitely it's a film for those interested in the ideas involved (i.e. four cameras filming a single take, and the synchronicity between them) and this is most interesting when you hear Mike Figgis' voiceover track or see the other excellent supporting stuff on the disc. It's also useful on the DVD to be able to select one of the four cameras and only hear the sound from that, instead of just the overall mix.
All in all: A very interesting idea - Not hugely entertaining in it's own right as a film, but most definitely worth renting or buying to see what Mike Figgis was attempting. Unique.",978912000,,759,4.714285714285714
1202347,5,B00000F3XU,"THE NEW FILM MEDIUM OF THE FUTURE IS NOT EVEN FILM!  IT IS DIGITAL VIDEO.  THIS FILM IS QUITE BRILLIANT AND INNOVATIVE IN MANY WAYS.  THE FIRST IS THAT FIGGIS BRINGS THIS NEW MEDIUM TO A FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL MAINSTREAM AUDIENCE.  SURE, DOGME 95 IN DENMARK, DANCER IN THE DARK, ETC. HAVE ALL DEALT WITH THE DIGITAL MEDIUM.  BUT FIGGIS, AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNER, SHOWS A MASS AUDIENCE THE POSSIBILITIES OF DIGITAL VIDEO.  GETTING BIG NAME ACTORS AND ACTRESSES TO HELP HIM IN HIS EXPERIMENT DIDN'T HURT HIS CAUSE EITHER.  SECONDLY, NO ONE HAS EVER SHOT A FILM (WITH A VISIBLE STORY) IS ONE TAKE.  HITCHCOCK CAME CLOSE IN ROPE, BUT IT WAS NOT A TRUE REAL TIME FILM.  FIGGIS PRESENTS NO GIMMICKS IN HIS SHOOTING.  ONE REALLY FEELS AS IF THEY MIGHT BE WITNESSING ONE AND A HALF HOURS OF HOLLYWOOD LIFE.  AND ON THAT SCALE, REAL TIME SHOOTING THAT IS, IT IS MAYBE THE MOST INNOVATIVE FILM EVER MADE.  I KNOW OF NO OTHER NARRATIVE FILM THAT HAS ACHIEVED SUCH A FEAT.  I ACTUALLY DO NOT LIKE FIGGIS.  BUT THIS FILM IS HARD TO IGNORE.  IT TAKES IDEAS OF FILM, THEATRE, PERFORMANCE ART, SATIRE, COMEDY, AND NUMEROUS OTHER THINGS AND BLENDS THEM INTO A SINGLE IDEA.  DO NOT BE CAUGHT UP IN THE PLAOT.  IT IS ONLY SECONDARY.  SURE...WE HAVE SEEN FILMS ABOUT THE DEMISE OF HOLLYWOOD A MILLION TIMES.  BUT THAT WAS ONLY IN THE STORY LINE.  IN TIMECODE WE GET THE DEMISE OF HOLLYWOOD AS THE PLOT, BUT THE REAL DEMISE OF HOLLYWOOD AND HOLLYWOOD FILMMAKING IS IN THE ACTUAL MAKING OF THE FILM ITSELF.",978048000,3,1480,4.451492537313433
1202348,3,B00000F3XU,"Mike Figgis' experimental foray into digital media is a film shot completely in real time and played out over a screen divided into quarters. You watch four small screens all at once and while inventive, it's more than a little gimmicky. It does have a great cast though, including Selma Hayek and Stellan Skarsgrd. If you've ever seen the Polish art films of Zbig Rybczynski, this will remind you of them.",976492800,,406,4.732394366197183
1202349,3,B00000F3XU,"4 digital cameras. 4 quadrants. 4 continuous shots.  All in real time.  All improvised.  Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas) is definitely one of the most innovative directors out there.  And that's what makes the film worth seeing.  It wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be to follow all four quadrants at the same time.  Figgis turns the volume up on the shot he wants you to pay attention to.  The cast does a fine job, although I'm not exactly sure what Salma Hayak is doing in this company.  Stellan Skarsgard is great as usual.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is literally on screen in a continuous shot for the length of the film and she is fantastic.  Look out for Holly Hunter, who has very little screen time, but who gives her character more depth than this film deserves.  The reason I only gave this film 3 stars is that it didn't engage me.  Watch it for its stylistic qualities and not for its story.  I recommend the DVD format.  After all, digital cameras deserve digital video.",971308800,10,988,4.5397727272727275
1202350,4,B00000F3XU,"This movie uses an idea which if not new, has at least not been fully  utilised before. The screen is split into four parts, each one in a  different place in the same city, four stories happen at the same time,  with characters moving from one screen to another. Surprisingly it isn't as  confusing as one would think. Usually only one or two screens have  important action going on at the same time. Half comedy, half drama, this  movie should not be missed. Oh yeah another cool thing about this movie is  that it was recorded in four long takes, it wasn't shot in a million  different parts. The story is rather complex so I won't go into it, but it  does involve a jealous lesbian lover, an independant movie studio and the  world's worst hip hop artist. P.S. Can't remember all the actors but the  cast is pretty decent.",965952000,2,826,4.44
1202351,5,B00000F3XU,"Definitely not a thriller.  But if you're a fan of watching the subtleties of actors getting into a role, you will probably enjoy this film.",1242432000,,140,4.6
1202352,3,B00000F3XU,"Timecode is a behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood life - the business, the politics, the jealously, and even the drugs, sex, and rock `n' roll.  Salma Hayek plays Rose, an aspiring actress who will do anything to get an audition - even if it means cheating on her jealous lover (Jeanne Tripplehorn) with a male film exec (Stellan Skarsgard).
But I said that Timecode is unique, right?  Well, it is.  It had no script - just a story, four digital videocams, and a bunch of actors who could improvise their way through 90 minutes of filming.  The four cameras shot non-stop - no cuts, just one take.  The entire film was shot 15 times - and the final one was released.  No editing was required because viewers see the footage from all four cameras - simultaneously.  The screen is divided into four quarters, and it's up to the viewer to decide which one to watch.  Believe me - it's not exactly an easy task.  Though you're often given audio hints (the sound of one quarter will dominate for a while), you'll still keep jumping from quarter to quarter, trying to figure out what's going on - and what you've missed.  It's definitely not a movie to watch if you're not completely alert.  It is, however, very interesting.  And while I wouldn't say that this is one of my favorite movies, it's still an interesting experience.  If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, it's worth checking out.
If you happen to pick up a copy of the DVD, you'll find all kinds of goodies.  The special features include the entire Version 1 of the film (and yes, it really is different) and an audio option that allows you to choose which dialogue you want to listen to.  Perhaps, then, if you watch the entire movie four times, you'll be able to make sense of it all...",1053993600,3,1761,4.5284810126582276
1202353,4,B00000F3XU,"Whatever.  I mean, I appreciate the experimental nature of the film -- the screen split into four separate-but-interlocking screens, each shot in a continuously-running tracking shot, filmed on digital video.  The ""action"" shifts from scene to improvised scene, and gradually we figure out how each of the characters know each other.  Still... did the story really have to be set in (yawn) Hollywood?  Can't modern filmmakers think of something else to make movies about?  Couldn't the actors improv their way through somebody else's life, for once?  Regardless, this is one of the better uses of DVD technology I've seen -- they kept the audio tracks intact on each camera's footage, so after you soak up the edited version of the film, you can go back and see (hear, actually...) what they had to work with... Rarely do we get such a clear-cut chance to get into the headspace of the director and editor, so that at least was kind of cool.",1039564800,2,941,4.813664596273292
1202354,2,B00000F3XU,"""Time Code"" was directed by Mike Figgis, best known for ""Leaving Las Vegas.""  I'm not a fan of his work, but was intrigued by the concept of this movie - it was filmed in one 90-minute take and is told via four cameras shown in different quadrants of the screen.  The movie was filmed 15 different times over a period of a few weeks, with the 15th take being the theatrical release.  The story (such as it is) concerns 20+ people in Los Angeles who are connected in one way or another to a small indie film studio.  The soundtrack is emphasized in certain quadrants at any given time to show you where to direct your attention.  I was concerned that the movie would be difficult to follow, especially on a TV, but it was actually fairly easy to watch it and understand what was transpiring.
The technique is innovative and daring, and one cannot help but admire its audacity.  It was also interesting seeing how the different stories overlapped.  However, there are simply too many weak points for the movie to ultimately succeed.  First, the acting and script was largely improvised, and it shows.  Selma Hayek has one of the largest roles, and she is simply not up to the challenge.  Holly Hunter also comes off poorly with her tentative stuttering character.  Second, the plot (which was loosely structured by Figgis) is not very interesting.  If this same script was shot in a conventional manner, it would not be worth the price of admission.  Third, the concept of the four quadrants is interesting, but most of the time little is happening in any given quadrant.  For example, the upper left quadrant, features mostly Jeanne Tripplehorn and she spends a huge portion of the movie sitting in the backseat of a limo or pacing the sidewalk in front of the studio.  It just isn't very entertaining.
The DVD includes several interesting features.  For example, the full first take of the movie is included.  Also, you can remix the soundtrack to hear what is going on in the other quadrants.  Overall, I have mixed feelings about ""Timecode.""  I'm glad I saw it and hope that other directors will be inspired by its unusual and daring techniques.  However, it was ultimately boring and pretentious.",1018051200,8,2199,4.706806282722513
1202355,5,B00000F3XU,"The best expression that I can utter about this film is Wow!
Four seemingly disparate storylines, filmed in real time merge into one compelling movie. This was a bold experiment in cinema, showing 4 films at once, drawing your attention to the frame the director wants you to focus on by audio alone. What results out of initial chaos and confusion is a stunning statement on the convergent reality of our lives.
 The final release version of this film was the 15th 'mix' - the first of which is available for viewing on the DVD as a contrast.
This is an excellent example of thoughtful cinema - heart and mind put into film, as opposed to mindless Hollywood action.",1016150400,3,666,4.5966386554621845
1202356,3,B00000F3XU,"In terms of the ""Art"" of cinema, Timecode is probably one of the most important films to be presented in over a decade.  Unfortunately, it is also a terrible movie. The intertwined stories are ""vapor thin"" and the characters are practically non-existent.
There is a certain amount of pleasant confusion created when a phone rings on the soundtrack and people in two different quadrants pick up a receiver to begin seperate, unrelated conversations, or when you realize that the actor who moments before left quadrant two has just entered quadrant four, or when quadrant's one and three are filming the same action, but from different perspectives.  Unfortunately, these charms are not capable of sustaining interest for the entire film.
I'm grateful for the existence of this movie, but I don't really want to sit through it again (though I guess I'll have to since I bought the DVD). Timecode is like a question mark, a challenge to contemporary narrative modes.  But, I suspect it will take many many years for that question to be answered, and the narrative challenge it represents to be assimilated and used artfully.  If you really want to get a glimpse of the immediate future of narrative film technique, watch Memento, or grab a copy of Tender Loving Care or Point of View (of the two, TLC is better than POV).",1008028800,,1318,4.844444444444444
1202357,3,B00000F3XU,"Although the concept behind Timecode is highly unusual and creative, the technique of showing four different scenes at one time by dividing the screen into four windows is distracting. Three windows will continue their action silently while the viewer is privy to the soundtrack to one of the four windows. And the soundtrack changes to different windows throughout the film,  so you are never quite sure what is happening and where. Eventually you piece together the whole story and easily see the interconnectedness of the four screens, but it is, like I said, a distracting technique. However, I applaud whatever person attempted this concept because it is groundbreaking and different and strives to be something more than what we are used to. Interestingly, you would think that the character development would suffer immensely from this kind of format, but oddly, you can tell a lot about each of the characters by their actions with and without the soundtracks.",1002931200,4,968,5.1265822784810124
1202358,3,B00000F3XU,Time code opened my eyes & ears immediately when i heard it was going to be split into 4 separate screens. The way Mike Figgs came up with this idea is incredible! I have to admit that this film can get you confused with all the thing happening all at the same time. But that's the magic in this whole film. The Actors/Actresses in this film are excellent with improvising their acting capabilities; it really pushes them to the limit.,1002758400,,435,4.45
1202359,2,B00000F3XU,"I greatly admired the technical feats in this bold experiment in film narrative, but at the end of it all, it feels like a wondrous opportunity wasted.  It is obvious that a tremendous amount of time and care was spent to engineer and choreograph the simultaneous and interweaving real-time stories with the four cameras, so it's deeply disappointing that such little attention was given to the actual story.  The main problem with the story is that it is so prosaic, not to mention its dearth of creativity as exhibited by its use of an earthquake not once but FOUR times!  The story's conventionalism frustrated me because it begs the question of why it needs to be told with such an unusual narrative technique.  I can only assume that Figgis included the more pointless and tangential threads in the story in order to justify the four concurrent screens, but Robert Altman has been effective in depicting the multifariousness and random nature of human existence for decades without needing to abandon conventional cinematic methods.  No, I think the only way to do this experiment justice is to have integrated into the story the concept of telling it in such an unusual fashion, perhaps not unlike the concept film the Russian songstress was pitching to Red Mullet near the end of the film.  This resulting movie may have indeed been ""pretentious"", but at least it would not have been aimless and pointless.  Stellen Skarsgard's Alex's charge that the songstress' pitch was ""pretentious"" is an obvious sign that Figgis had more ambitious plans in mind but laziness clearly prevailed, and Figgis attempts to pass his film off by deconstructing the pitched concept film to the point that it becomes the film that we are actually seeing on the screen.  And this deconstruction is not only cheap, but bizarre as well, because deconstruction should only be applied to well-worn ideas and not avant-garde ones, because otherwise, avant-garde would never get beyond the artist's imagination and into the production stage.  But most importantly, I would rather see a contrived and pretentious concept film that sparks conversation rather than an exercise in self-congratulatory cleverness.",1002067200,,2187,5.103641456582633
1202360,5,B00000F3XU,"True, Mike Figgis' great experiment is not an unqualified success, but it's so far from a failure that it deserves recognition.  The split-screen shooting, which initially might seem a gimmick, quickly becomes a revelation. (I remember audibly gasping the first time two images combined to form one.) Few commercial directors are as actively trying to redefine and reinvent the form as Figgis. Gimmicks/innovations aside, the film is a hilarious send up of both Hollywood-style politics and Altmanesque busy narratives. The DVD version features perhaps the best use of the technology yet, allowing the viewer to see an alternate take of the entire film, and freely switch between soundtracks.",999648000,5,692,5.407407407407407
1202361,4,B00000F3XU,"In the mind of director Mike Figgis, a vision has been born. That vision is ""Time Code,"" a film that is not one, but four different stories going on at the same time, all seen in an innovative method of filmmaking using handheld cameras and a screen that shows four pictures at once. Never has anything quite like this been done before; it's one of the most impressive movie-making ventures I've seen in a long time.
It's only too bad that Figgis pays more attention to his style than to the substance behind the four cameras. The movie is divided into separate storylines, some weaving into the other, though none of it ever has any emotional impact when the last frame rolls.
The overall plot begins with Emma (Saffron Burrows), the wife of movie producer Alex Green (Stellan Skarsgard), and while she contemplates leaving him, he is having an affair with aspiring actress Rose (Salma Hayek). Rose is involved in a rocky relationship with wealthy lesbian Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn), whose jealousy and suspicion drives her to place a bug in Rose's purse so she can monitor her actions during Rose's audition. As all this goes on, Alex's partners and employees are busying expressing their concerns to one another about his instability.
The interaction of each plot line allows for some very unique filmmaking touches, some of which are very impressive. The cameras are constantly rolling, and throughout the course of the film, characters will find themselves in several differing screens, something interesting to see happen. One scene that sticks out in the mind is the scene in which Rose and Alex meet behind the screen in the studio's screening room. Their interaction goes from two different screens to one; it's completely inspired.
Yet, any emotional feeling or understanding of the events at hand is diminished due to the constant grappling with trying to watch four screens at once. Some characters walk on screen and off so quickly that there is little knowledge as to why they are there, while our interest in one story tends to take away from all others. Figgis attempts to draw our attention to one story at a time by using the sound as a focal point (one screen will be clear while all others are almost completely muted), but it hardly works.
The film is interesting enough to watch it for its splendid four-screen division, though the plot seems to be muddled and misunderstood as we try to concentrate on one thing at a time. Still, ""Time Code"" is a movie that will go down in history due to its introduction of a dazzling new technique.",998438400,,2558,4.802721088435374
1202362,4,B00000F3XU,"This a real flick for movie lovers, and since most people are what I would think can be described as the lowest common denominator (after all, this movie did come out in DVD and people are still willing to experiment with movies they have little clue about) - it's no wonder it got low ratings. SO here is the warning - if you want simple straight-forward entertainment - don't get this DVD. It is meant for those willing to put up with 93 minutes of constant deciphering, and then can still take the extra 7 versions of the same thing. Note that the DVD has version 15 (the released version), then the version with the director's commentary, then version 1 and version 1 with the director's commentary and then you can view version 15 with the audio separated to each frame, basically allowing you to view at that point each frame by itself. That last feature seems to work very oddly on my DVD and after a lot of hacking I was able to view only 3 of the 4 frames (couldn't get the lower right one to play by itself). This experiment teaches you as a viewer a lot about the meaning of a frame, of improvisation, of locales and positioning of cameras, the importance of continuity, and so on. Take it and get yourself a free evening with this gem. I personally suggest smoking something before it, because then the 5.1 audio is simply divine.",992131200,,1342,4.437246963562753
1202363,2,B00000F3XU,"Mike Figgis is a director who likes to take chances and doesn't follow the crowd.  Sometimes the chances pay off (""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Miss Julie"") and sometimes they lay an egg (""Loss of Sexual Innocence"").  This attempt belongs in category B.
Figgis has to be given high marks for ambition and innovation in producing this unusual movie.  He shoots the story from four cameras at different locations that are all shooting in real time as the characters weave their way from camera to camera.  The resulting footage is then shown simultaneously with emphasis placed on a particular camera by bringing up the sound.  The technique is interesting and vanguard from a production standpoint.  The result, however, is disappointing.
Figgis is so intent on the gimmick that he abandons all else to pursue it.  The story is extremely weak.  The movie is shot with hand held video cameras giving it a homemade look.  The work by the camera operators is dismal.  Shots are out of focus and bouncing around, subjects are improperly framed.  It looked like it was shot by a bunch of college students (Oh, I forgot; that is what made Blair Witch Project a smashing success.  I didn't like that one either).  The lighting is poor and other than the limo, the sets and props are just whatever is lying around.
Two of the frames spend almost the entire movie focused boring characters doing next to nothing.  One stays with Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn) eavesdropping on her girlfriend Rose (Salma Hayek) with an electronic listening device from the cab of her stretch limo; a real yawner.  The other follows Emma (Saffron Burrows) around as she wanders the street depressed over her breakup with Alex (Stellan Skarsgard); another utterly unexciting theme.  Thus, there are only two frames of any interest for 90% of the movie (notice I don't call this a film, because video is not film).  Figgis also throws in four visual non-sequiturs, i.e. the inexplicable earthquakes that relate in no way to the action in any of the scenes.  I suppose he felt that watching four screens simultaneously wasn't chaotic enough.
Figgis played around with the idea of simultaneous shooting in the seduction scene of ""Miss Julie"", where he used a split screen of the scene from two different perspectives.  In that film, the technique worked well.  Actually, the technique is not new, as it was used from time to time in the 1960's (""The Thomas Crown Affair"" with Steve McQueen jumps immediately to mind).  However, Figgis should be given credit for taking the concept to a new level with an uncut real time shoot, strangely reminiscent of the Steve Martin film, ""Bowfinger"" where he had actors follow Eddie Murphy's character around in real time, playing scenes with him without his knowledge.
The acting is more a tribute to the ensemble cast's improvisational ability than anything else, and in that regard the acting is excellent.  The story is unscripted and the actors improvise around a general framework provided by Figgis.  Given that fact, the scenes went extraordinarily smoothly and whatever magical means Figgis used to cue the actors to stay coordinated, it worked amazingly well.  The cast is comprised of recognizable and talented second tier actors, who normally appear in supporting roles in major films.  The exception is Holly Hunter, who is a bona fide star, but had very little to do in this movie.  The two best performances are given by Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.  Tripplehorn, when she was not sitting around eavesdropping, was explosively good.
Figgis, who could never be described as unassuming, throws in a little tribute to himself by having one of the characters pitch a concept to the movie producers that is essentially the movie of which she is a part.  As always, he cast his girlfriend Saffron Burrows in the film, which is becoming his signature much the way ""Silent Bob"" is Kevin Smith's signature.  Hopefully, they will never break up, or Figgis will need to find a new watermark.
Overall, this self-indulgent experiment does some things well, but lacks the minimal production values necessary to make it more than a novelty film.  I rated it a 4/10.  It is an interesting concept that is poorly executed, wasting some good performances by a talented cast.",989452800,,4272,4.949509116409537
1202364,4,B00000F3XU,"Most people seem to hate or love this movie. The point is that Mike Figgis has laid out a template for an alternative cinema. A new, fresh format. The only way Mr Figgis could make the industry understand his concept was to actually make one. This movie is perfect testament to his vision and perseverance. The possibilities are far more challenging, yet satisfying to the actors. The ensemble choreographed the free-wheeling creation of a huge 3-D stage. This cinematic brother of theatre in the round allowed them to reside in the 'moment' for an ungodly amount of time, much like theatre. Watching the actors having so much fun was a wonderful viewing experience in its own right.",987811200,2,683,4.846153846153846
1202365,2,B00000F3XU,"As Dr. Malcolm from ""Jurassic Park"" would say, Figgis was so excited that he *could* make a movie this way that he didn't stop to think whether he *should*. For one thing, if it's possible to shoehorn a meaningful story into two hours of real-time (and the dismal John Badham thriller ""Nick of Time"" strongly suggests that it isn't), Figgis didn't figure out how. This is one stupefyingly dull movie! To make things worse, the jazz-loving director calls upon the sort-of-all-star-cast to improvise the dialogue for him. If all the actors had the talent of Holly Hunter or Stellan Skarsgard (who predictably provide the few good moments here), it might have had a remote chance of working. But when you have performers with as little going for them as Jeanne Tripplehorn and Salma Hayek clumsily pretending to be lesbian lovers, the result is painfully embarrassing. And while I enjoyed having to work at monitoring the different streams of visual information, there was so little payoff at the end that I felt foolish for having bothered.",987552000,2,1038,4.937142857142857
1202366,3,B00000F3XU,"Since 1999, several films using unconventional techniques or creative storytelling methods have hit the mainstream and done pretty well. I have only to cite `The Blair Witch Project', `Being John Malkovich'or 'Memento' to remind anyone of the innovative and provocative movie-going experiences most us have recently had. Now in the midst of this lively period comes the latest Mike Figgis film to push acceptable viewing boundaries even further out. Where `Time Code' differs from the three aforementioned titles, however, is that its innovations are really only technical. There is a strong sense, gained twenty minutes in, that this movie exists to demonstrate its unusual approach to visual format.
`Time Code' addresses several questions that have surely floated through every viewer's mind while watching movies. What might prompt an editor to cut away from, or return to a given scene? How might a character behave, if the camera is kept running after a scene has ended? What if the viewer, and not the filmmaker, were to choose which character or plotline to follow? To answer to these and other queries, the director chose a format utilizing four main cameras, each receiving one quarter of screen space. The viewer of `Time Code' is presented with four simultaneous viewpoints at once. On rare occasions, only one or two mini-screens are on view. And just as rarely is more than one interesting narrative occupying the attention. Watching `Time Code' is like seeing dailies shown all at once before editing. The viewer can choose which screen to watch, but Figgis directs attention to a given quadrant by bringing up the sound on it, while the other three remain silent. On a few occasions, dialogue on more than one screen may be heard, but never when both are important. There is at least one interesting sequence when two screens present differing angles of the same scene, and at these moments the film really seem alive with possibility. But the use of this multi-screen method must be counted as a very interesting failure, since, in order to make a coherent film, Figgis has to direct attention by sound level and by having three screens show nothing of interest to distract from the main narrative. In the end, we are left with a rather conventional movie experience. The use of smaller, multiple screens is hardly new: in 1968, `The Thomas Crown Affair' made colorful, if ultimately pointless, use of the technique. In neither film is montage, the great contribution of the editor, rendered superfluous.
Had Figgis found more interesting narrative threads to follow, the film might have worked better. Not that the main plot thrust-an independent filmmaker trying to cast his latest project-- lacks potential. There just are not enough attention-grabbing moments. An audition scene, for instance, unintentionally involving an on-set masseur, never fulfills its comic implications. Instead of showing the many aspects of such a project that would certainly fascinate most viewers, the film presents lengthy, static production team discussions. Subplots don't fare any better. In one, an executive is unhappily surprised by news from his wife and goes temporarily insane in a sequence that feels half-baked. Another subplot involves an actress en route to her audition: we witness a heated argument in the car with her female partner, then, later, we see the partner take up her own story line. The problem with these and other minor threads is that they all feel like excuses for the film at hand and its technique. A sudden melodramatic turn at the climax comes across as pure contrivance, and-as a result of the multiple screens-something the audience quite literally can see coming. In addition, there are not one, but two female on female make out scenes which also feel completely inserted for the benefit of a hetero male audience.
The soundtrack of `Time Code' is also problematic, but in a less straightforward way. We hear several pieces composed by the director himself as well as segments of the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony of Mahler. The music seems `placed' within the film, never functioning organically, to underscore a scene. This abstract, objective use of music has the effect of a pretentious hommage to Jean-Luc Godard and not an integral part of the film at hand.
A very good cast is used to little effect. While it is good to see Xander Berkeley is a major part, he and Holly Hunter, Stellan Skarsgard, Kyle MacLachlan, Steven Weber, Julian Sands and Jeanne Tripplehorn are not given roles that add up to very much. Only Salma Hayek is memorable as a creatively ambitious aspiring actress.
There is little doubt that the film has its greatest possible effect on the big screen. For all the above criticism, this movie is still worthy of a look by anyone interested in new storytelling solutions. Just don't expect any revelations.",987379200,,4875,5.064676616915423
1202367,4,B00000F3XU,"Time Code is an excellent example of what film can and should be. It's definitely an experiment that the affordability of digital video allows. Shot on a Sony digitial video camera, Mike Figgis has woven a great story. The screen is split into four separate quardants, four intertwining, and simultaneous, storylines. I defy you to follow a single set of characters. Figgis uses sound to draw you through the story, raising and lowering the levels of different quads he'd like you to be looking at. It's excellent filmmaking. It is a challenging watch, but not as hard to follow as you might think. This excellent DVD version has an entire other ""version 1"" of the film which even features different actors. It's great fun. Highly recommended to the Indie Film Fan.

1202368,5,B00000F3XU,"Film is an art form.  Sometimes.  Timecode is art.  Its story reminds me of an Altman movie (one of the old ones, from when he knew what he was doing), but presented in real time and split into four points of view presented simultaneously.  For the first ten minutes or so, it's difficult to follow the four screens, but it's not as confusing as you might think.  The stories are touching, although they could have been tightened a little bit - at times it looks like the actors are drowning in improvisation.  Most of the time, however, things flow beautifully.  The stories are great, just don't expect them to be all wrapped up neatly by the end of the movie.  They're more like ""slice of life"" stories.  A few people have criticized Timecode for the fact that a boom and a cameraman's hand intrude into the shot during the movie.  Come on - we're talking about four cameras moving simultaneously around a bunch of improvising actors for two hours at a time!  It is utterly impossible to expect a perfect shot under these circumstances.  Plus these people are totally missing the point.  One final note - the DVD includes an alternate take which, as I understand it, is a complete alternate version of the film.  I can't wait to see this.",983145600,4,1241,4.5565610859728505
1202369,4,B00000F3XU,"i'll admit that i liked time code a good bit but that doesn't mean that this is the type of movie for everyone by any means. first you can forget an intriguing story line because it takes place in an hour and a half of time and no REAL stories happen in that amount of time. also, the actors who are mainly improvising (more entertainig than you think) so they end up going to the lowest common denominator, sex and COCAINE, lots of cocaine. so you gotta realize this is more art than it is entertainment but it will definitely make you go hmmmmm. it is true that if you want to see stories interact this isn't the best example but the film knows that and the filmmakers are not trying to express that this is the best method of story telling. it is more like ART FOR ART'S SAKE. some technical notes: the music is great and works exceptionally well with the movie,  there are some noticable mistakes throughout but you can make it a game to see who can spot them first(afterall they were extremely long takes)and of course the small screen takes away from the movie and may have you squinting some.",982195200,,1099,4.360975609756098
