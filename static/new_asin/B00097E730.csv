8057908,5,B00097E730,A classic in Mexican historical cinema. Black and white film transfer was excellent but sound was challenged to hear clearly without home theater system. Acting and directing were superb. Just like the book,1394668800,,206,5.2727272727272725
8057909,4,B00097E730,"For those whom do not wish to read the classic book, this is a very good rendition. About the movie itself, the acting is fairly good. Except that I would have put Pedro Armendariz in the ""Demetrio"" role.  I wish to acknowledge a few more people: Carlos Lopez Moctezuma plays a good role as ""El Curro"". He normally plays the villain in most of his movies. I am glad to see him on the protagonist side. Beatriz Ramos, though shown only at the beginning and at the end of the movie as ""Demetrio's wife"", does a good interpretation. The distinguished director Emilio Fernndez and the proud producer Ral de Anda, both participate as supporting actors, though they are not directing nor producing this classic movie. About the DVD itself, I have the AlterFilms version. They did a very good job at cleaning up and remastering the film. However, there are some glitches due to the damage on the original 35mm. Speaking of glitches, somebody did a big mistake and the error was not caught before production. On the biography feature, they put a photo of Esther Fernndez on Isabella Corona's bio and a photo of Isabella on Esther's bio! For me, this is not acceptable. I purchased this movie because I like Esther very much. She is a cutie! Her character role as a Chihuahuan campesina is excellent. I love her dialect! I just wish more of her films would be released (remastered of course) before I get too old.",1317772800,3,1404,4.616
