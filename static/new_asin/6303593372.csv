Although done for a mexican entertainment company ( at that time, literally, the only mexican entertainment company) that is known for anything but artistic freedom OR expression, it's obvious he was able to impose his own vision on, what would other wise have been, a rather dull comedy. (He's credited only as director). The plot is very simple and yet he managed to incorporate dialogues and double-meaning ""one-liners"" that touch on complicated issues and images that are strong and provocative. And it's done in a very subtle, almost sensual, surreal way. He really manages to portray our social contrasts and religous fervor. And it's also funny. Unfortunatly for foreigners, it's also very mexican, so many simply won't ""get it"". There's this one scene, where 2 of the main characters are offered food on the street car. The masterful surrealism doesn't lie in what the food is, but in that it would be carried out just as casually in real life here!! If you like Bu&ntilde;uel, you really should see this.",990662400,5,1122,5.032258064516129
