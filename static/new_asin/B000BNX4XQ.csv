Some of the actors I recognized from other projects.  Too bad they couldn't get it together or realize the potential to re-broadcast it or put it on dvd.  Too bad for us !",1369958400,2,334,4.015151515151516
8089503,5,B000BNX4XQ,"I loved this show that aired around 1999. It was based around a business and the innerworkings of the relationships of the individuals in the office and in their social lives after work. Most intriuging was the outer and inner dealings of Lori Voplone and russian mobster Nicky Krasnikov. Their ongoing love affair was hot that it could've melted the ice in the north pole. I never had access to buy it in 1999 and haven't been able to find it now,since it's not new. They should bring back Beggars and choosers and put it on dvd so others who liked this show,can buy it too. Rudolf Martin has been on other shows since then but,I think Nicky Krasnakov was Lori Volpones soul mate! And this was his best role! If anyone has it on dvd,or if Amazon get's it,let me know.thanx,:)*",1331164800,5,777,4.47887323943662
