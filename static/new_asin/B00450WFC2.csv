8416445,3,B00450WFC2,"Not that it makes a tremendous amount of difference for lucha libre flicks (if you don't speak Spanish), but the subtitles actually did facilitate an understand of precise relationships among characters when I was watching. Unfortunately, this 1972 production isn't one of the better Santo y Blue Demon flicks in terms of being imaginative.
The first match is Blue Demon vs. Cave-Dweller Galindo (narrated), and the second is Santo vs. ?? (not narrated).
""Contra las bestias del terror"" is more expensive than some of the other selections, but paying extra for subtitles was worth it for me.",1443916800,,591,5.103092783505154
