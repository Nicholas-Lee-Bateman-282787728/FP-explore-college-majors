You will be able to learn by observing the sequence of strokes and colors that are used.  For a much more indepth training series I have put together a 4 part series called [...] these four dvds cover everything from drawing with a brush, watercolor techniques, to turning imagery into abstraction.  The purpose of this video is to showcase several different painting sessions all on one dvd.

It doesn't work - you can't hear anything he says.  It plays in high speed. ""No help at all.""

And #@&#$@ Am*z*n won't take it back cause the 30 day window has expired (my friend didn't get it back to me in time).

Avoid this dvd and reconsider purchasing things from Amzn.  The A-Z guarantee only lasts 30 days!",1231459200,11,440,4.058139534883721
8704737,1,B0010XZ96Q,"This video was such a disappointment. When we played the dvd, it played in what looked like fast-forward and only had loud music for the audio portion. John Gholson was speaking into the camera, just like on his website, but no words were heard. I don't know if this was just a defective DVD or if this was what all of them are like. I don't think I want to trust getting an exchange for another one.",1199059200,24,400,4.207792207792208
