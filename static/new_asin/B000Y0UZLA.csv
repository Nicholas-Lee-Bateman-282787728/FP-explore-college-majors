8230758,2,B000Y0UZLA,"Ok so lets start with the acting is not good.
I tried to watch this movie with a open mind. I read the reviews and even though I had heard not about it wanted to give it a shot. I am a big fan of these kinds of movies. I will say it may lose a bit in the translation to English but the acting is just not very good. The story line is a bit all over the place and hard to follow. It is defiantly a B grade movie. If you like that type of movie this is for you.",1451520000,,459,3.5098039215686274

8230764,5,B000Y0UZLA,"WolfHound was recommended to me by a girl friend from Russia. She knows what kind of Movies and Music I like (13th Warrior, LotR, Iron Clad, ManOwaR (band), etc...) and said I'd love this... she was right:

1) WolfHound IS AWESOME!!! And, mainly because things DO get lost in translation, it didn't seem to flow like a Hollywood Movie might. But, it also did NOT appear like it was produced by some amateur film maker... and the story was Great! ((( Kinda ))) Unique and it ultimately 'Made Sense' so who cares what 'other' movies are like (?)

2) The guy who played Volkodav (Wolfhound - Main Character) was killer! At some point in his life, he'd been bound, broken, beaten, and left to brew in his own anger.  One day, it was gonna explode out of him.

3) The Princess IS someone you WANNA help! The actress playing the princess ((( Oksana Akinshina = Beautiful! ))))  kept the film from being a Fantastic Fictional Fiasco

4) I like than than allot of Hollywood's newest Films, that all seem to be getting 'Lost in Commercialism'

5) The story really IS very cool!!!

If you get to see it, I hope ya like it",1337904000,4,1111,4.438423645320197
