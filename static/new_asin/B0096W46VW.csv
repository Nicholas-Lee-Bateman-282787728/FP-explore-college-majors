5274685,4,B0096W46VW,"Many people are complaining about 2 things:the banned episode 12 is not listed and this set is not from Tsuburaya Productions. What people do not understand is the episode is out of any official set, because sadly Tsuburaya took the decision many years ago to ban it from the controversy we all know happened. This set is not from Tsuburaya Productions because they lost the rights of the older series outside of Japan, so any US or region 1 box set of the original Ultra Q, Ultraman, Ultraseven, and Ultraman jack, will never be a Tsuburaya Productions. For the quality of this set we must wait until December to give an opinion. I give it 4 stars because I am happy that I can have the complete series of my hero of childhood, something I wanted for many years. It will be a nice X-mass present for any Ultraseven fan.",1348617600,6,820,4.473333333333334
5274686,5,B0096W46VW,"I am excited that Shout Factory (God bless this outfit) is releasing ULTRASEVEN in the States - finally! But I am here to inform all of you, and by ""all of you"" I mean ANYBODY who enjoys imaginative and wildly entertaining material (not just Japanese stuff) of what a great shame it is that the rare and little-seen TNT dubbed version of ULTRASEVEN will not be made available on this DVD release - a glorious opportunity terribly wasted. Please DO NOT believe what you may read or hear from other Japanese fantasy fans putting the program down. Any such individuals who disparage this marvelous version of the series simply do not get it, probably not unlike anybody who doesn't ""get"" Seinfeld, or Ab Fab. I am in my late 50s and I am a trained fine artist, college level educator/lecturer, and professional film and film music journalist/critic. I grew up with Godzilla and ULTRAMAN. I am a veteran of the ""front lines"", I was there when it all first went down, when it all began; I saw GODZILLA VERSUS THE THING (Mothra), GODZILLA VERSUS KING KONG, MONSTER ZERO and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS in theater when they first premiered here in the States and I was watching Ultraman when it first ran on American TV in the 1960s - and my love of Japanese fantasy has never waned over the decades. I have all the American DVD editions of the Toho films (and I adore them all) and dozens of collectable figures and toys. Here is the story: During the 1990s I had a job that required my getting up at 5AM (horrible). The one upside to this circumstance was that I just happened to turn on TNT in the wee hours of the morning and caught - and recorded - the first episode of ULTRASEVEN! TNT ran - one time only (as far as I know) - an English dubbed version of the show that I believe the network had directly commissioned from some small company in Canada. Here is the vital detail: this dub is absolutely unique in that it was secretly (unknown to TNT) conceptualized and executed with a slightly sublimated degree of irreverent humor! My wife and I had watched several episodes before we even realized what was going on - the English dub was an enormously creative, albeit subtle spoof of the sci-fi/fantasy sub-genre! One sort of has to first become aware of this, but once you are (and NOW you are) the dialogue then becomes an utterly delightful and sophisticated jab at the inherent preposterousness of the fantasy/adventure premise. An example: One of my favorite ""bits"" involves the hero, Dan Moroboshi and the pretty Anne Yuri, checking out an office building that has been overrun by spooky aliens. As Dan carefully stalks the dark halls, his ray gun drawn and Anne following, he tells Anne ""Go back outside to the car and wait for me, it is too dangerous in here."" Anne refuses to go saying ""No, I won't leave you. You may need help."" Dan, getting frustrated, says ""Look, I can't effectively protect you and me both - you can help me best by waiting in the car."" Anne still refuses saying ""No, I won't go!"" to which Dan finally yells ""Damn it, if you don't leave I'm gonna shoot you myself!"" This is funny on so many levels. One) It is a sure thing that the Japanese-speaking Dan never said any such thing - not even close! This was a kid's show! Two) The new dialogue puts humorous light to the overt chauvinism running rampant throughout both ULTRAMAN and ULTRASEVEN. The female members of the science units were usually being told to make coffee, or stay behind whenever the men flew off to fight monsters. Three) Dan's rude comment is actually on-target as regards what an actual husband or boyfriend might have said during the less politically correct decade of the 1960s - trust me, this stuff is gold! In my opinion the fantastic ""TNT dub"" of ULTRASEVEN stands as one of the most creative programs ever devised for broadcast in America - and hardly anybody has seen it! I taped every episode TNT ran (thank God) and so I can enjoy this masterpiece whenever I desire, but this is just not good enough! EVERBODY, including YOU, needs a chance to experience this rare gem. Please write TNT and demand that they release their version on DVD, or at least re-broadcast it uncut. Chant after me: WE WANT THE ULTRASEVEN TNT DUB! WE WANT THE ULTRASEVEN TNT DUB!",1348531200,8,4257,4.566013071895425
5274687,5,B0096W46VW,"I have only ever had the chance to watch the English dubbed version of Ultraseven when it first appeared on TNT many years ago, but I still have very fond memories of Ultraseven.

With all of the legal turmoil that Tsubaraya Productions had gone through, it seemed as though there wasn't any hope of seeing any Region 1 releases of anything created by the studio.  A few years back there was the original Ultraman release by BCI, but they apparently didn't even get the original master negatives, but a second generation copies from the Thai company Chaiyo, the very company in legal battle with Tsubaraya over who had the official rights to the Ultraman property.

I didn't think I would ever live to see anything officially released here in the states.  A few years ago there were the releases of Iron King and Super Robot Red Baron (which I love and still have in my collection), but once BCI Eclipse went under, all hope for any further releases of anythign else were dashed...  until the announcement of this release from the super awesome company Shout Factory.

I remember that this series had more darker themes and more grown up and intelligent stories, which I love.  I believe around the time of this season's release in Japan, there was a positive comparison to the original Star Trek series, with regards to its intelligent approach to science fiction, along with the well rounded characters and the approach of the storytelling.

While Ultraman Hayata was the first Ultraman series and laid the groundwork for the Ultra franchise itself, Ultraseven is usually the series people tend to remember with fondness, admiration and respect.

I loved the design of Ultraseven, I loved that he was an alien who took on the form of a human being, and I liked that this Ultra character didn't have that pesky three-minute limit, and was able to fight for longer periods.  I also love the monster designs and I also loved the character dynamics and the professional atmosphere of the Ultra Garrison itself as both a scientific investigative and paramilitary organization.  I'm hoping the release of Ultraseven will pave the way for other Ultra series to be released here in the states.",1348444800,16,2187,4.836461126005362
5274688,5,B0096W46VW,"When I heard about UltraSeven getting released on DVD by SHOUT Factory I was really hoping against hope that it would be the long-lost Hawaiian dub and not the insidiously goofy dub performed in Canada. The Canadian dub is okay if you just want to laugh at what you are watching a'la Mystery Science Theater without the commentary -- but I would like to be able to enjoy the series in a more serious light.

Besides, I have ALL the Seven episodes in Japanese and ""in Canadian"" even the infamous Crystallized Corpuscles on DVD already so if this release doesn't have English subtitles or the aforementioned Hawaiian produced UltraSeven voice talent then I have little use for it.

So I will reserve my final rating for this DVD set for later.

I would also welcome a release of the original Ultra Q with English subs -- AFAIK this was never dubbed in English. I only have it on some crummy VCDs -- Q is pretty dark and moody, kind of a Japanese Twilight Zone and its even filmed in monochrome. Fuji from Ultraman is a co-star and there are a few cameos from other characters like Ito that would show up in later Tsuybura productions. Would love to finally have this on DVD and again I don't care who its licensed from or who is getting the money. Its not like these are current shows and Tsy Prod. haven't made a gazillon dollars on countless other stuff -- no, they are way old so really who cares!?

Jan 17, 2013 Edit: Boy, I shoulda known tokusatsu fans are sensitive and I would step on a few feet with my comments. Well, people this wasn't the only lo-star review and now some buyers are reporting the video quality is less than what one might desire - especially if the product costs more $70.00! Now, I wasn't sure at first if this would be the TNT dub, but no its just the Japanese w/ Eng. subs and that unfortunately doesn't make it any more or less appealing to me. Looks like a lot of people ARE NOT going to get what they want - the TNT Canadian dub or the rare Hawaiian one and likely they won't shell out $70 bucks for this but maybe the good news is it will become a collector's item and those who take the plunge now can flip the DVDs for a profit in future!

Anyway, I am revising my rating on the merits of THE PRODUCTION and its ENTERTAINMENT VALUE, because Ive really enjoyed Ultra-Seven and will often go back and watch them again.",1348358400,,2351,4.34624145785877
5274689,5,B0096W46VW,"As a fan of the Ultraman series, since it started airing in late 60's, I am glad and gratefull for this release, as I was for the Ultraman series a few years ago.  Ultraseven is one of our favorite heroes and I will buy with no hesitation this dvd set.  As for complaints that it does not come from Tsuburaya, I am sorry, but that company has done absolutely no effort to make available their material to Western countries, their DVDs are sold at an impossible price in asian sites only.  So I welcome this effort to give us this classics episodes at a great price.",1347926400,7,565,4.311320754716981
5274690,4,B0096W46VW,"I was amazed to get Amazon's notification of the Ultraseven series coming to DVD.  From my youth, I knew of Ultraman and only Ultraman.  It would be years into adulthood before I knew there were any other series like this, much less finding out Ultraman was ALSO a sequel of its own from ""Ultra Q"" (aside from Johnny Sokko and the various Godzilla adventures that were shown endlessly in US syndication).  It was my understanding that the original Ultraman series became too expensive to produce, thus it was only in production for one year.  Evidently, with series still in production as of the date of this review, that may not have been the case.

I first became aware of ""Ultra Seven"" when it showed up in weekday morning syndication on the US TNT network mid-90's.  They would run two half-hour episodes, which were HEAVILY edited and almost comedic in their English translations (dubbed in the mid-80's by Canadian outfit CINAR).  Visually, the series looked a lot like the original Ultraman....but the tone took a different direction, bringing in heavier moral and ethical scenarios (even in the limp Canadian dubs).  The creatures also became more outrageous (whereas many of Ultraman's foes appeared to be based on actual mutated animals).  The series eventually shifted to weekend overnights, usually late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, for an hour...unless a movie ran late.  TNT was good about posting schedules and episode titles.

I got ahold of an original DVD set of Ultraseven a few years ago.  At the time, the going price was $500.  You read that right.  Five HUNDRED.  Boxed set of 12 discs, with subtitles in other Asian languages, no English.  It is still available here on Amazon, I think a new set is going for $1500 (add one THOUSAND to what I just quoted!) or something like that & used for about half.  One thing I learned early, legitimate Japanese DVDs are not produced ""en masse"" and first runs tend to be very limited.  For example, when the Godzilla franchise was rebooted in 2000 and the second film didn't come out over here, a Japanese DVD was almost $100, while a no-frills import from another Asian outlet was about $10.  Same quality, just no extras.  Many of the Ultra series have been released on either LaserDisc or DVD over the years.  All very expensive.

There is another Asian set for Ultraseven out there for $20 or less that likely falls into the same category as the Godzilla films I mentioned, but it has recently disappeared from listings, so your best bet is likely going to be this set coming out in December.  I cannot comment on the legalities of the parties producing the set, but it is widely available for research online.  While the original Japanese set was 12 discs, this set advertised is six...so they obviously doubled up on each disc.

Ultraseven appeared later in Episode 18 of ""The Return of Ultraman"", which began the ""guest star"" episodes so popular in the rest of the series, most notably Episode 38 of ""Return"" with both Ultraseven AND the original Ultraman.

One thing all of these Ultraseven DVD sets have in common, the lack of infamous ""Episode 12"", YUHSEI YORI AI O KOMETE titled (and banned) ""From Another Planet With Love"" in Japan and dubbed ""Crystallized Corpuscles"" in Canada.  Bootleg copies of the Japanese print are out there, but TNT did in fact air the episode once in 1997 and once more in 2000.  At the center of the ban is the storyline, radioactive aliens that use wristwatches to suck the blood out of young women, storing it as crystals, to replace their own polluted blood.  As the episode progresses, the aliens discover the blood of children to be ""more pure"".  Also, the episode's Alien ""Spell"" (or ""Spehl"" in dub) is referenced as ""Hibaku Seijin"", a play on ""Hibaku-sha"", a term used for survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  When it becomes giant-sized to fight against the backdrop of a setting sun, it has welts and lesions all over its body.  A print article ran about it, calling Spell-seijin HIBAKUSHA-monsters.  Complaints arose, citing the episode compared bombing victims to vampire aliens that use children's blood to cleanse their radioactive blood.  Tsuburaya Productions pulled the episode from circulation and it is rarely referenced in Japanese archives of the series. Hiroko Sakurai, who played ""Fuji"" in Ultraman, has a role in this episode.

The two prior releases of Ultraman looked pretty good to me, both the multi-disc two-parters and the economy-packed set, and I used to have VHS tapes made from the 16mm films that were traded for so many years.  I would expect this new release to follow in that range.  I will update once I have my own copy to review.

**ADDED January 4** I logged in to update my review and am surprised to find the item unavailable from Amazon.  It was shipped to me when it came out by Amazon, so there must be something I'm not aware of that has come about since shipment.  As for the DVD set, it's certainly not the pricey Japanese treatment, but this is essentially all you need.  The discs are kept in safe two-sided plastic trays that allow for all the discs to fit in the standard size DVD case.  Extensive booklet is included and Episode 12, plus the lack thereof in the set, is covered equally extensively (including mentioning the airings on US television!).  The picture quality is about as good as you will get anywhere else, I did note night time scenes occasionally have an ""overprocessed"" look to them (like punching up the saturation too much in PhotoShop on a frame), but it actually reveals small details in scenes I hadn't noticed before.  Overall it's a worthwhile purchase.",1347580800,52,5661,4.7917525773195875
5274691,1,B0096W46VW,"This supposed ""official"" release is in no way official. Like the Ultraman sets of a few years ago, it comes to us not from Tsuburaya, but from Sompote Sands and his Chaiyo company. Sands, one of the biggest lying crooks on Earth, has for years claimed he owns (and even co-created) the entire Ultra franchise. Better that the shows never come to the States than come in a way that lines his coffers and not Tsuburaya's. Purchasing this is a vote of confidence for a scummy con man who has made life hell for Ultra fans for well over a decade. Anyone who believes that buying this will somehow help Tsuburaya's cause in the US is living in a fantasy world.",1347235200,10,655,4.421487603305785
5274692,5,B0096W46VW,"I can't say enough about how exciting it is to see Ultraseven finally make it to Region 1 DVD, and in the original Japanese with English subtitles.  There are plenty of resources on the internet that can give excellent background on this series, its creator (Eiji Tsuburaya), and in particular, the incredible popularity of this particular tokusatsu series, rivaling and in some ways surpassing Ultraman.

At this moment, the press release from Shout! Factory is just hitting the nets, so rather than try and regurgitate the news, perhaps one of the best resources to include here, is from August Ragone, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eiji-Tsuburaya-Master-of-Monsters-Defending-the-Earth-with-Ultraman-and-Godzilla/dp/B00342VF4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters: Defending the Earth with Ultraman and Godzilla</a>.

5274693,5,B0096W46VW,I really loved the original Ultra Man series. The excitement that I got watching each episode really made me determined to find out if Ultra Man ever came back to Earth after he departed to get his emergency light repaired. I just knew that if I searched long enough I would come across something that would clarify whether or not Ultra Man actually did come back. Each episode that I have seen definitely more than satisfied my curiosity. It definitely seems that in each confrontation Ultra Msn Jack is always implementing an assortment of weapons that the original Ultra Man never did.

The show is known for putting its hero in complex moral dilemmas, and also utilizing some very unusual monsters. You expect to see an Ultraman duke it out with Godzilla wannabes, so it's refreshing to see him fight something as weird as a possessed sea-faring juggernaut built from sunken WWII battleships. My favorite episode was easily the one with the kappa and the kid who kept sighting aliens in his telescope: they're among the few episodes that really had interesting characters.",1452297600,2,651,4.927272727272728

5274717,5,B0096W46VW,"To be completely honest, I prefer the original Ultraman to Ultra Seven, but Ultra Seven is still an excellent program. The writing focuses more on science fiction than action, and it should appeal to a slightly older demographic than Ultraman. It feels very similar to Ultra Q, if you're familiar with the show. If you're not, well, I could say there is a bit less cheese and more ""Outer Limits.""

I do have one minor complaint, however. I've watched ten or twelve episodes so far, and I'm starting to see several patterns--1) All the aliens know Dan Moroboshi is Ultra Seven, 2) All beautiful women Dan meets are aliens/robots in disguise, 3) Dan needs to keep his Ultra Eye in a more secure pocket because aliens keep stealing it, 4) All the aliens, even the good ones, are trying to conquer/destroy earth.

5274730,4,B0096W46VW,"Shout! Factory steps up to the plate and scores major points by offering American fans the complete (except for the infamous episode #12) sequel Ultra-hero series from Tsuburaya Productions. Video & audio are OK, but nothing to rave about. Unfortunately, Shout! optioned these shows from Chaiyo licensing rather than directly from Tsuburaya, so they did not have access to pristine original camera elements or other equally high-quality source materials when making their DVD masters for this U.S. release. More backstory on the bizarre, twisted and ultimately very sad history of who has legal this & that for the first 6 Ultra shows can be easily dug up online (search Chaiyo vs Tsuburaya) ...and probably touched on by a few other folks right here in this review section.

UltraSeven features good (but obviously dated) FX, interesting characters and solid writing but even so, for me, Seven simply isn't as cool as the original Ultraman series. Granted, childhood nostalgia plays a HUGE factor in my preference for Ultraman, but I also believe that UltraSeven simply got too bogged down with the evil-alien-of-the-week formula. At least Ultraman gave viewers a fairly well-balanced variety of bad guys. UltraSeven just has an unending stream of evil aliens headed towards Earth to conquer or destroy! week after week after week.  Sheesh! you'd think that eventually these so-called superior alien types would get the hint that Earth was under the protection of UltraSeven and that any attempt to invade would end up with them getting their arses handed to them, but nooo! They just keeps on a-comin'! How many smug, stubborn alien races can there be, and why is Earth such a big score for them? Yes, I know it's all silly, make-believe entertainment, but it just got old rather quickly. That said, there are several standout episodes during this show's 49 episode run that are chock full of genuine tension and excitement, so don't let my naysaying turn you away. If you love invading intergalactic whatchamacallits for our red & silver Hero to duke it out with, you get 'em in spades here! I do enjoy the series and it has solid replay value, but if forced to choose I would pick an episode of Ultraman to watch over UltraSeven every time. It also hurts that there is no optional English dub track for UltraSeven. Certainly budget vs. profit had a large part in why Shout! chose to NOT have new dubs created for this older series, but IMHO, it's a strike against it for those possibly considering purchasing it for younger kids. Personally, I don't have a problem reading subtitles. I own several Japanese live action superhero shows from the Golden Age (1970's) or Tokusatsu (special effects) shows. However, it would have been really nice to have had a choice of both subtitles and dubs. Sometimes you just want to watch a show without ""reading"" it, ya know?",1389744000,,2865,4.929606625258799
5274731,3,B0096W46VW,"Ultra Seven is by all means a classic as far as Tokusatsu is concerned. It set standards for not only future Ultra series, but the sci-fi medium in Japan as a whole. It's an entertaining, if dated, series that is well worth a watch.
This DVD set, however, leaves much to be desired. Since this is not using masters directly from Tsuburaya, but rather through the infamous Chaiyo productions, the results of this set make it feel like a rushed and unoffficial product. Audio glitches happen on multiple episodes, scenes skip or loop out of nowhere even after I ordered a replacement disc, and the translations are often very spotty. The subtitles often seem like they were a rough draft with inaccurate lines and inexplicably mistranslated episode titles. A show this good deserves a better treatment than this. Unfortunately, this is the only way to get Ultra Seven outside of Japan legally, and the price for the set is reasonable. I highly recommend the show, but take this set with a very large grain of salt when watching it.",1389744000,,1029,4.754189944134078

5274745,4,B0096W46VW,"I've purchased plenty of boxed sets put out by Shout Factory in the past and I've come to expect a certainly level of professionalism from them. This time around, I'm more than just a little disappointed, but since this is the ONLY way of owning Ultra Seven on DVD I can't exactly turn my nose up at it.

The packaging itself is beautiful and it comes with a little booklet that's quite informative about the show, including explaining why one episode is missing. However, aside from that the DVDs themselves aren't terribly well put together. One of the first things I noticed is an inconsistency with the subtitles. Frequently episode subtitles contradicted the ones given in the menu. That, plus my limited understanding of Japanese caused me to notice that the subtitles were not always accurate. Sometimes, a person would say something and nothing would appear at all!

The subtitles also have a tendency to be a second or two out of sink, or occasionally vanish too fast, particularly on longer sentences. This makes it difficult to keep track of what's being said and having to rewind back a few seconds. That leads to the next problem.. there's no indexing! You can skip from the Opening to the Episode Proper, but after that there's no option for moving from one chapter to another. Roughly 23 minutes as a single chapter.. that's atrocious for what should be a highly anticipated DVD release of a television show!

Then there's the complete lack of English voice acting. It does actually exist, I think TNT did it ages ago. They even aired the missing episode over here. To a degree, I understand why it was pulled out of circulation in Japan at the time. However, this is the next millennium.. are we really going to keep hiding the episode because it upset -a single person- who raised a stink about it? The episode didn't even cause a problem until a specific person found out about it sometime -after- it aired! Regardless, I found it disappointing that this didn't include both languages as an option.

Considering the price I paid for it, I expected a much better compilation and feel a little ripped off. However, it is nonetheless very good to have these episodes available and they are, at least, subtitled in a way that we can still watch the show. Even if they aren't terribly accurate.",1365465600,3,2307,4.731343283582089

5274754,4,B0096W46VW,"It's been a long time coming, and for those of us who are die hard fans, another one of the series is available in the USA on DVD.

First, I say ""Kinda"" in the title of this review, because as you have probably read in any of the other reviews, Ep 12 is not available, so in essence, it isn't complete.

The quality of the DVDs is a bit substandard for Shout I think.  I've got some of their other products, and I've never seen so many lock ups during the playback.  Maybe I got a bad bundle, not sure.  When I was playing the episodes, on about half the shows, it would just lock up at the end of the opening title sequence.  A couple of times it completely skipped the episode and went to the next one on the disc.  I was able to go back and play it, but it was still annoying.

The transfer quality was about as good as it is going to get I think.  We're talking about a show from the late 60s being put on discs in 2012/2013.  No complaints there.

The subtitles are lacking though.  I do speak some Japanese, and noticed that some of the translations were off here and there.  Nothing glaring, but enough errors that I noticed it.  Also, the timing of the subtitles were off in a lot of places, not synched up with the people talking; either coming too early or too late.  It didn't stop the flow of the show, because I was able to follow what was going on regardless.  Just, as someone who used to do timings for these kinds of things, it can be an issue.  Maybe get a QA check in place?

There is only one bonus feature on the set.  The transcripts from a cast reunion.  Nothing great or fancy, just some interesting insights from the cast members.

The menus are simple and straighforward, just the way I like it.  In this day and age when every single disc menu has 2 minutes of footage play before you can make a choice...!  I like just getting to it and then the show.

Presentation of the set is great!  Love the box and cover art!  Also, the booklet that was included is fantastic. Some info I already knew, some of it was new to me.  Very well done!

Overall, great set, very much worth it.  A few little problems here and there that could be fixed with a bit more time being spent on the quality.

So, what's next?  Plenty of Ultraseven specials to follow up with.  More Ultra shows, if they go in order, Jack (Return of Ultraman).  Or if they want to get more going here in this region, there are two series that were filmed in English, so no translations necessary (Ultraman Towards the Future - Ultraman Great & Ultraman Powered)  Both were 13 episodes each, so they could be small sets to keep people interested.

I hope everyone that loves the Ultra series gets this and sends a message to Shout and the other companies that we want more of this here in the states.",1359331200,3,2785,4.2102272727272725

5274756,4,B0096W46VW,"For those who remember the brief period on US television where the English dubbed version of this program aired (over 20 years after it was produced in Japan) this is a welcome set of DVDs especially since it includes a couple of episodes that were not aired in the US as far as I remember. However it is missing an episode that did air in the US as it has been removed from distribution in Japan.

The English dubbed version is no longer available so what is here is the original Japanese soundtrack with sub-titles. The script is very similar although the English narrator (who was doing a sort of Ted Knight imitation) did add a few lines in a couple of episodes. This version also includes all of the censored violence such as monster decapitations, limb amputations and monster suit explosions. One episode has mass executions!

One drawback is the quality of the prints that were supplied to maker of this set. While the color is better than anything I have seen before, night scenes are very dark and some of the model work is hard to see. Frequently the live action scenes are oddly out of focus. Also the quality of the episode writing varies greatly. Some episodes are great in their way, others seem barely thought out. Some of the crazy, creative directing that can be seen in the original Ultraman is here as well.

If you are familiar with the original Ultraman series, this is not quite the same. UltraSeven is far less whimsical and where the original show was a combination of classic style giant monster stories to light fantasy to alien invasion episodes, UltraSeven is fixated on alien invasion. The writing is darker and aimed at an older audience than the original series. Also there is a Thunderbirds influenced attention to rockets and flying vehicle technology. Plenty of time is spent watching spaceships shoot sparks and lasers at each other. The quality of the plentiful special effects seems lower than the original series.

Packaging:  very nice, I really enjoyed the 24-page book by August Ragone!
The jacket and interior artwork are also very appealing.  All in all, I feel
a lot of thought and consideration went into it.  As a result, the dvd has a nice
little ""heft"" to it that suggests its more than a bare-bones offering.

Content:  I've only seen the first disc and so far I have not had any problems
with playback (as Amazon is currently claiming some have reported this - I will
amend my review if I encounter problems going forward).

Video quality: I am satisfied with the video quality.  I'd rate it a 7.5 out of
10.  That may seem generous to some or too high to others, but having lived with
the crap-fest that is offered by the Turner boots I own, these are great.  I
suppose its only a matter of time before some toku pirate gene-splices the subs
here onto the re-mastered dvds from Japan (and charges you $100 for a copy, lol).

Anyway, I vote to support Shout and our good friend August - let's hope the
trend to release these classics continues.  If we're lucky, we'll have English subs
for ALL the Ultra series someday.",1357171200,5,1181,4.416666666666667
5274761,5,B0096W46VW,"This is my first Amazon review, so I hope it's informative.

THE SHOW ITSELF:
This is the third ""Ultra Show"" from Tsuburaya Productions, although it's not really a follow up to any of them. The concept is very similar to the 1966 Ultraman show, except aliens are always the villians here. That is not necessarily a bad thing, although it loses points for variety. I'm only on disc three, but I already enjoy this show more than Ultraman. While Ultraman had better characters, monsters, music, and variety; Ultraseven pretty much excels everywhere else. The episodes are more compelling and it has better writing and plots. There aren't any annoying kids so far (a terrible early staple of the genre). In the original Ultraman series, Ultraman always felt like a Deus Ex Machina and you would always wait for him to defeat the monster. In this series, however, it gets more complicated. The monster isn't always the main conflict; sometimes Ultraseven has to save someone, uncover a mystery, prevent a major disaster, and even face a moral dilemma. Now THAT'S more interesting than your typical monster-of-the-week formula! If you're a fan of Godzilla, Gamera, or any other Japanese giant monster movie or TV show, you'll dig this.

THE DVD:
This DVD release of Ultra Seven is very well done. It's great to finally have these classic tokusatsu (Japanese special effects) shows on DVD in the U.S. for the first time. The picture quality is not perfect, but it's definitely watchable. I'd say it's a step up from BCI Eclipse/Mill Creek's flawed Ultraman DVD release. There are no video special features, but there is an excellent booklet with an essay on the history of the show written by August Ragone. It's such a detailed and interesting essay that I really don't mind any more special features on the discs. There are six discs in a standard-sized DVD case. This saves a lot of room on your shelf since it's not a big box set like BCI Eclipse's Ultraman set. Now I am aware that there is an episode missing, but it was banned and not even included in the Japanese DVD. That's a shame because it sounds like a really good episode. Despite some minor flaws, it's obvious that Shout Factory gave this DVD release their best effort and it really shows.

CONCLUSION:
This is a no-brainer for any kaiju/tokusatsu fan out there. I also highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits, or just enjoys mid-century sci-fi in general. Shout Factory has been releasing quite a bit of tokusatsu shows recently, and I hope they don't stop here. I hear rumors that we may get a DVD release of Ultra Q soon. Maybe we can even get Zone Fighter eventually! Keep 'em coming, Shout Factory!",1356912000,7,2715,4.747881355932203
5274762,5,B0096W46VW,"Unless you grew up in Hawaii, in the 70s, you probably discovered Ultra 7 in the 90s on TNT like I did.  By the time I saw this particular production I was already in my late 20s, which was perfect due to the comedic treatment that the production team chose for this version of the show.

This DVD set is more pure in treatment to the original production.  It is spoken in the original Japanese with English subtitles.

Sometimes, the subtitles are a bit inaccurate and the audio fades out in several occasions.  However, this is not really that big of a deal unless you can actually follow the Japanese audio.

Ultra 7 is one of the most popular series of the Ultraman shows.  In the US, we only ever had the first Ultraman series aside from the Hawaiian version of Ultra 7 that was cited above.

Ultra 7 was the last of the 60s productions; for this reason, it still has cool atmosphere, music, sound effects, cars, gadgets and uniforms.  The productions of the 70s lost that feel and just don't look as good.

Ultra 7 could have been my favorite series but it falls short on monster design; also, it seems that they didn't take certain things as seriously in this show.  The aliens have comical sounding voices and some of the concepts, even names of planets and aliens are a bit cheesy.  In this sense, I still think the first Ultraman is the best that there ever was.  It was more sober and the creatures were more convincing.

In other ways, Ultra 7 was more sophisticated, even to the point of being over-produced.  I think the studios knew that they were going to market this series to death and therefore the production was sensationalized.  The scenery and filming are the best of any Ultraman series.  They really capitalized on the psychedelic imagery of the time.

I was anxious to read the subtitles to see how much the TNT version digressed from the original storylines  they were actually pretty faithful to the original scripts.  Word of warning, reading the subtitles really starts to wear down the eyes after a while.  I would like to watch the series again without reading the subtitles just to enjoy the scenery and imagery in a more relaxed setting.

The exposition is a bit poor at times.  For instance, I don't remember the Ultra Squad (Guard) naming Ultra 7 in the first episode as they did in the first Ultraman episode; however, from the second episode on, they just refer to him by that name with no further explanation.  There are also some weird edits that I thought were poor edits on the part of the TNT production but they remain in this original, un-edited version.  The most classic example is in the TNT episode, Wayne, Lord of the Universe.  There is a scene where Ultra 7 is trapped in a circular opening that is closing in on him.  The opening is a door panel to a saucer.  The alien appears and starts to fire upon Ultra 7.  In this TNT version they break to a commercial and when they come back Ultra 7 is free and flying outside of the ship  he becomes big and starts to push the ship.  In all these years, I thought that was a bad edit only to find out that that is exactly what happens in the un-edited version.

By the way, Ultra 7 changes size but the original Ultraman did as well  it just wasn't openly announced but it did occur at least a couple of times.

Also, it seems that they like to implement story ideas in pairs  they had two episodes back-to-back where a young girl steals Dans Ultra Eye.  In another situation there is two episodes back-to-back where exploratory spacecraft are launched and alien worlds take it as an invasion of privacy and threaten violence  they just want the earthlings to leave them alone.

If you are an Ultra-Series fan this box set is a must  this is the best picture quality I have ever seen for this series (I have also seen 2 episodes of the Hawaiian series).  I still think the first Ultraman series is better but I have grown very fond of Ultra 7 due to the TNT series  it was the proper series to have seen for my age at the time.  This original series would have been great to see when I was a kid at the time when I was watching the original Ultraman along with Space Giants and Johnny Sokko.

I really wish that the Turner/TNT version could be released on DVD but I am certainly happy that I have this Set!",1356739200,27,4301,4.411689961880559
5274763,5,B0096W46VW,"Very nice release from Shout! Factory of the complete UltraSeven television series. Image quality is very good even though it is a bit too dark, but a definite step up from the BCI Ultraman sets from 2005. And it must be taken into account that the video/audio assets were provided not by Tsuburaya Productions directly, but from the worldwide distributor Chaiyo, who obtained the distribution rights in some... questionable way (apparently) and don't have access to the Tsuburaya Productions library. Audio quality is good but there are some ocasional imperfections in the audio (for example there's some audio dropout at 4:30 on episode 2).

The 6 discs come inside a quite space saving box in a cardboard slipcase, and it includes a extremely detailed 24 page booklet: ""The making of Ultraseven"" by August Ragone, author of the book ""Eiji Tsuburaya, master of monsters"". Also, there are some text interviews with the main stars on disc 6, a very nice surprise feature!

RECOMMENDED!",1356739200,3,985,5.074074074074074
5274764,4,B0096W46VW,"I grew up on re-runs of the Original ""Ultraman"" in the 70s so he's a very important part of my childhood. When I saw that ""UltraSeven"" was being released by Shout Factory I was interested, but not thrilled. UltraSeven looks so different from the original. And what's that on his head? Is he some kind of Ultra Trojan? Well, I got the set and watched all of it. And as soon as I was able to let go of the original Ultraman -- just for now -- I liked it.

My review of Shout Factory's ""UltraSeven"" DVD set will go into the similarities and the differences between it and ""Ultraman"".

Japanese Clark Kent
First off, a lot of it's the same. There's a man belonging to a super-techy organization who slips away when trouble hits to turn into a 50-meter superhero. He doesn't use a beta capsule, though. His trick is a pair of fancy shades he pulls out from his right breast pocket, same place Hiyata kept his capsule. Interestingly, the actor who plays Dan Moroboshi looks very similar to Hiyata.

The Hero
UltraSeven has a different paint scheme, some shoulder armor, very different eyes and a mohawk like detachable blade on his head. He looks the same... yet different. He can wield the famed Specium Ray which the previous Ultraman used. But he also has a lot of new tricks including shooting a beam from his head and tossing his 'mohawk' to slice up the monsters.

The Monsters
Wait, wait. Hold on. We'll get to that later.

The Alien Invasions
Here's one of the biggest differences between 'Ultraman' and 'UltraSeven'. Practically every single episode features a new invasion plot from a new set of aliens. Whereas the original show did this now and then, UltraSeven does it every time... except for now and then. The aliens always covet the Earth, make plans to make it theirs and are all very good at out-of-place maniacal laughter when finishing sentences. They often disguise themselves as, possess, take over or remote control humans as part of their scheme. And there is a lot of repetition on this alone. There are even 2 back to back episodes where they almost completely repeat what they did previously, just with different faces. These alien storylines take up most of all of the episodes. And then...

The Monsters
... then a monster shows up at the very end, often for no reason other than to just have one, and to have someone for UltraSeven to battle with. In the original 'Ultraman' it was all about monsters. They were the mystery. Where did they come from? What are they up to? That filled the show. In 'UltraSeven', monsters seem like an afterthought.

The Ultra Garrison
This group is UltraSeven's answer to the Science Patrol. For all intents and purposes, it is the Science Patrol with new faces, uniforms, ships, etc. We get to see a lot more of the interior of their building in this series. For me, at first, I wished Hiyata, Ide, Arashi, Fuji, etc. were there. But I got to know and really like the group fairly quickly. Some fun facts here: The actor who plays Arashi in the original series is part of this group but plays a different character. Also interesting is another member of the Ultra Garrison is played by Bin ""Satoshi"" Furuya who is also the actor who plays Ultraman himself as well as UltraSeven.

It's Clever
Despite the repitition in the episodes, many of the stories have really original and interesting plots and ideas. Tons of them! In fact, taking into consideration that this series first came out in 1967, I'd wager that a ton of movies and tv series, etc. gained inspiration from this series. I lost count at how many ideas from this show may have wound up in future titles. Star Blazers, Star Trek: The Next Generation and a whole lot more may have ""borrowed"" a little from UltraSeven.

If you're a fan of the original Ultraman, you'll probably like this ""UltraSeven"" set. The quality of the discs are very good (or as good as they can be for a show from the 60s that probably used 16mm a lot on location). There are no annoying trailers or previews which you're not allowed to skip through. The chapter button will let you pass the (sorry) annoying theme which comes in at almost 2 minutes long. Curiously, the English subtitles are not on by default. All in all, good show, good DVD release, nice price. Get it now while they're still around. This title isn't exactly the type to get released again.",1356652800,5,4350,4.595360824742268
5274765,5,B0096W46VW,"Having only seen the TNT dub from the early 90's, I was very much looking forward to this new release. It does not disappoint. The episodes are as sharp as they can be, and the subtitled stories are more enjoyable without the silliness and forced comedy of the TNT dub. The booklet that comes with the set is very well-researched and informative, an excellent accompaniment to the series.

My only qualm is that the subtitles are not very attractive: they are big, yellow, and weirdly blocky. The syntax is a little weird sometimes too, but never to the point where you can't follow what's being said (or meant).

It's worth noting that the series was not shot with modern widescreen TVs in mind, so you will see black bars on either side. Also, the ""banned"" episode 12 (From Another Planet with Love) is not included, although a thorough explanation of why is noted in the booklet.",1356480000,3,882,4.647435897435898
5274766,5,B0096W46VW,I grew up watching more than one Ultraman series. Ultra Seven was the second Ultraman series I watched as a child. These are fun to watch and relive your childhood.,1355961600,4,164,4.5
5274767,4,B0096W46VW,"It's really cool to see shout factory decided to remaster the Ultra Seven tv series which aired in the 1960s. I have always been a fan of Ultraman since I was a kid but I had to wait years later till the invention of the internet to finally be able to access all the varied Ultramen that have appeared from the 1960 to today. I have had access to this series in dvd-r form but the picture quality and sound were sorely lacking until now! Their have been huge improvements in both departments here The sound (while definitely not hd quality) is surprisingly good considering that mono tracks were only available at the time of production. Shout Factory has created a pretty decent sound field But if you have a decoder or a 5.1 to 9.1 receiver I would highly recommend using PL2x movie for decoding the mono track into 5.1 it WILL make a big difference in over all bass and surround response.

Now..While the sound is pretty admirable the picture quality (while much better than the dvd-r copies) doesn't  quite seem to be on par with the Golden Media Group/BCI remastered versions of The original Ultraman. Which in my opinion where great! You really see this in overall black level, The black level in the Ultra seven is well below NTS standards and had to be lightened up considerably on my plasma display. This is usually done to correct imperfection with the film or just plain hide them which is fine but it keeps the viewer from seeing details in areas that were intended to just be shadowed a not necessarily blacked out. I compensated by using one of my unused plasma viewing choices (custom) and lighted up the picture and reduced the contrast (that was a bit to high as well) after that was done everything looked much better.

So there you have it..Ultra seven is pretty darn cool and is definitely worth the purchase if you are a fan of the Ultraman saga you'll just need to make a few modifications to maximize the experience!

Seven! Seven! Seven!! -  CHAAAAA!!!",1355961600,5,1976,4.570621468926554
5274768,4,B0096W46VW,"This set is the uncut Japanese version.  It is subtitled.  The audio quality is fair as is the video.  It doesn't help that i'm watching a DVD on a blu ray player on an HDTV.

The set is complete except for the ""banned"" episode.

I recommend this set  if you like Japanese Sci-fi.  and are a casual Ultraman fan.

If you are a diehard Ultraman fan and were not happy with the Ultraman DVDs that BCI put out a few years ago.  I do not recommend it.  It is about on par with that.",1355529600,4,478,3.9893617021276597
5274769,5,B0096W46VW,"So yesterday the DVD finally showed up at my door. Or rather landed in my face as I was sleeping via roommate delivery system. It had arrived much faster then I had expected. Anyways I am so happy to finally have the DVDs and not scattered bootleg videos.

Why I am really writing this is I have read some complaining about poor quality in the comments. First off the videos are in much brighter colors and is much clearer then the bootlegs I used to own (remember depose of bootlegs when legals come available). This set also joins my DVD collection. In it are the Tiga DVD series (Fox Box/Funimation) which clarifies how Shout Factory did a such an amazing job releasing Ultraseven. One person said they were against Shout factory while me I was grateful it was not Fox Box/Funimation again.

 As for the crappy effects, occasional wire showing, rubber suits, and other ""low quality"" effects remember when Ultraseven was created. This IS top quality special effects. This is the time before CGI, a time where achieving something amazing and visually appealing required thinking outside the box and a longer road.

Also for those wanting dubbed, the only DVD collection to contain Dubbed is Ultraman. Tiga does not even contain the dubbed episodes. So get over it, this isn't a unique situation I am certain they tried. If your a true fan you'd be just happy to see it appear. Same goes for episode 12, I have not seen it and I wish I could see it but oh well. As much as I know it's unlikely I do hope Ultraseven won't be the last series we will see.

Right, I am tired because have not gotten much sleep before work due to watching episodes. Hee. The only issue I am having with the DVDs is it seems I can't fast forward\rewind. Tried it on the computer and the DVD player. It'll skip to the next ep or back but not fast forward/rewind. Though I wouldn't let this stop you, I just have a DVD jinx on me.

I read this review and I realize how horrible it sounds. I'm to tired to fix it, but just know this is a good set. This person is fully content with the quality Shout Factory has done.",1355443200,7,2092,4.4067357512953365
5274770,3,B0096W46VW,"I really enjoy Ultraseven, my favorite of the Ultra series, and have been looking forward to this subtitled DVD.  Audio quality OK, and subtitles are adequate.  Video quality is poor.  Compression makes the image seem very grainy, passable but not good.  Pulldowns seem to have been applied in error, causing juddering ghosts in any scene with tilts or pans, which is very annoying and distracting, and detracts from the viewing.

I am very surprised and disappointed, as I have seen the Japanese DVD's, and the video and audio quality (all remastered into stereo with 5.1 on some episodes) are excellent on those.  I would have thought that a properly licensed release would have made those materials available to Shout Factory.",1355356800,7,729,5.033333333333333

5274772,5,B0096W46VW,"Please ignore the one star reviews, these guys are obsessive geeks who will never be happy with anything. I'll even address their complaints in my own non-review

Its not Tsuburaya releasing it: They had NO interest in releasing their shows in the US(at least at an affordable price), so if they had to lose a lawsuit for me to finally get some subtitled releases SO BE IT!

There is a missing episode: it was banned in Japan so it was not included in the masters. This ep was shown dubbed on TNT so you can buy a bootleg if you want to see that one ep.

Its not dubbed: Boo effing hoo.

Shout has done a great job with the treatment of other TV shows and I suggest that fans support this release. I started watching the fan subbed versions of this show and its really good, not a silly or lighthearted as the original could get, but a very cool show.

I''ve long had the episodes in which my girlfriend appeared (14 & 15) on VHS, but getting the DVD set provided me with my first chance to see the entire series. As was pointed out by another poster, the translations on the English subtitles are sometimes a little ragged and the dubbing does miss the mark at times.  (In the 1960's, all Japanese shows were shot silent and then dubbed in post-production -- by the actors themselves if they were Japanese and, as in the case of Linda and Terry Farnsworth, by Japanese voice actors.)  However, it's still an enjoyable viewing experience for those who like the Japanese sci-fi genre.  (For those who might travel to Japan, actress Yuriko Hishimi (Anne Yuri) now owns a restaurant called Asian Taipei in the Chofu district of Tokyo and Kohji Moritsugu (Dan Moroboshi) owns a restaurant called Joli Chapeau in Kanagawa.  I remain in contact with both of them.)",1486771200,6,951,4.704819277108434
