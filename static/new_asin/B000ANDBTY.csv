2389861,1,B000ANDBTY,"In 1973 I was 10 years old and I loved this show so much that I secretly wanted to *be* Steve Austin. I never missed an episode and I could hardly wait the 7 days until the next episode was aired. But that was 33 years ago.

I found the entire series on DVD from a Canadian company, I think, for around $235. I gladly paid the price and once again I found myself waiting to watch the Six Million Dollar Man. Finally, the DVD's arrived and here are my observations:

First, the sound and video quality is generally ok, but some sections are bad. In fact, 2 of my discs will not play at all.

Secondly, and more importantly, this show is awful. I mean really, really awful. The stories are weak and stupid, and the acting and the scripts are even worse. I had forgotten about the silly sound effects as Austin did his thing. I forgot about the dumb slow motion of his running as the bad guys ran away at normal speed. I forgot how fragile Austin was as I saw about 2 dozen instances where he was tapped on the head and fell to the ground, out cold. I tortured myself through about half of the DVD's, but no more. I've had enough. My disappointment is great, and if you've matured even only a little (like me), you'll be likewise let down. Save your money and don't buy this terrible TV series!

2389862,5,B000ANDBTY,"I got this from amazon.uk, as well.  It's necessary to have a region-free DVD player, but make sure that you also have a PAL-NTSC converter.  The converter can be stand-alone or built into the VCR.  It's possible to find region-free DVD players with a PAL to NTSC converter for under $100 on the Internet (see, e.g., [...]  Some have complained that the picture quality is bad, because it hasn't been enhanced.  I guess that's something I can live with pretty easily, because it doesn't bother me.  Bionic Woman DVDs, however, are supposed to have superb quality.  I loved this show so much as a youngster and am so glad to have it on DVD now.  Definitely cheaper than getting DVDs from Europe,  however, is getting them from Australia, usually region 2/4/5 PAL.  All my DVD sets from Australia (see [...]) including postage so far, have cost the same as getting them from the US.  From Sidney, Australia, the mail is faster (at least to the western US) than to send something from LA to DC, as well - can't think of a better way to do it.  Australia is definitely my choice if it comes available there first, even over region 1 NTSC - with a multi-region player with converter, it doesn't really matter where in the world DVDs come from.",1140912000,6,1238,4.552036199095022
2389863,5,B000ANDBTY,The Bionic Man (Steve Austin) played by Lee Majors opened the minds and hearts of audiences across the globe to an era when we hungered for superheros.  He had a knack for being able to help mediate problems across our globe to a point where the only resolution at hand was by the hand.  This science fiction program introduces a new concept to our world of robots and cyborgs.  A superhero with cybernetic strength created by humans using artificial limbs integrated into Steve Austin's humanity in order to enhance his ability to fight off all that is evil.  We americans are once again ready to embrace this hero back into our imaginations to inspire us with hope.  Where are you Steve?,1140912000,7,689,4.661157024793388
2389864,4,B000ANDBTY,"Obviously, I cannot review Season One yet, so I will reminice about a few of my favorite episodes throughout the series run:

1) remember when Rudy was bitten/attacked by a chimpanzee giving Rudy superhuman strength, leading to a fight between he and Steve Austin?  Great episode.

2) when Steve had to battle a robot likeness of Oscar Goldman.  Another great one.  I like when Steve first notices something strange about Oscar.  Oscar is walking on the plush carpet in his office and Steve finds it odd that Oscar's footprints leave such deep carpet impressions.  So, Steve drops a pencil on the floor and Oscar unknowingly walks on it, crushing the pencil into pieces.

3) the first meeting and fight between Steve and Bigfoot.

4) my favorite - Steve has to battle that Venus space probe machine.  I believe it looks like a small silver tank.  It had a grappling hook at the end of that long mechanical arm.  I remember it grabbing Steve by that mechanical arm and throwing him.",1140220800,10,981,4.705882352941177

2389884,5,B000ANDBTY,"I bought this because a few years ago I saw the collection for something like $600 and I didn't realize they'd finally come down.  The first season is a little raw as they are figuring things out.  Steve still picks up enormous rocks with his bionic arm even though you'd expect it to rip off of his otherwise human frame, but it's all fun.  He stops a car with his foot, rewires some tape drives in a nuclear power plant, and fights a robot (John Saxon!).  Season one is riddled with actors from Star Trek:TOS and other shows that were common at the time.",1467849600,,556,4.3173076923076925

This was built on the illusion of the 6 million dollar mans super powers .Unfortunately , what was great in my mid 70s childhood is pretty cheesy today . On a nostalgic level it is fun to lock back but the show simply isn't as enjoyable. It is one of those shows that cries for an Upgrade. It would be really cool.to see the character with today's paint job in special.effects and more current storylines. Don't worry I still love big foot but this program doesn't hold up.to well despite Lee majors stardom . I would be bored to watch these in anything but small doses and so will your kids.  I see this on one of the old.time channels in reruns once in a while now .

Stark and dismal, it was not. This was by far the most entertaining TV series on the air during the 70's. It made the whole Disco and political scene trivial for a hour, once a week. This season had several of the best episodes made. ""Population Zero"", ""Little Orphan Airplane"" , Dr. Wells is Missing"", ""Burning Bright"", and especially, "" Day of the Robot"" were the best of the series episodes that were offered.

2389943,5,B000ANDBTY,"Yeah, I know, everything probably thinks it was a campy little show, but The Six Million Dollar Man was actually a pretty good sci-fi/action program. Back in the day, at least in the seventies when I was growing up,  we didn't have a lot of TV super-heroes, and Steve Austin was the closest around until Spider-Man and the Hulk got their own shows.

sixmilliondollarman01I think everyone knows the story: Steve Austin, ""a man barely alive"" after a test piloting accident, is rebuilt to be the world's first bionic man. He helps out Oscar Goldman at the OSI, with various secret missions that border from James Bond to Allan Quartermain. Lee Majors starred as Steve, in a role that normally would've typecast someone forever, but he managed to avoid it in the same way Bill Shatner did with TJ Hooker. As with a lot of seventies TV stars, I think you pretty much get Lee Majors as Lee Majors, which isn't a bad thing.

The six discs of this DVD set contain the three pilot movies-of-the-week that spawned the production, as well as the entire first season of thirteen episodes. Guest stars include William Shatner, John Saxon, Gary Lockwood, Henry Jones, George Takei, George Montgomery,Noah Beery (right before The Rockford Files), Farrah Fawcett (right before becoming Mrs. Lee Majors), Don Porter, and many more.

The stories are actually pretty good, given the limitations of TV and the need for the special effects. One thing you'll immediately notice is that the familiar hollow da-da-da-da-da sound effect for Steve's bionics is missing from these shows; I had not realized that it wasn't added to the aural repertoire until second season. It shows up a few times being used by other characters, like John Saxon's robot double, but it's really the only annoying thing about the shows themselves. The episodes are all solid adventure tales. I do have to say that the second TV movie veers a bit too far into James Bond territory, at least in my opinion, making Steve Austin too much of a cardboard cut-out. Also, the final episode of the season, ""Run, Steve, Run"" is, for the most part,  a cost-cutting flashback episode, but still has a decent half-hour of original story.

The sixth disc is a bonus with several interviews, including a nice one with the late Harv Bennett, and a segment on the creation of the main title and opening of the show, which rivals nearly any show out there for ""most memorable"".

If you want the Steve Austin you remember as a kid, you'll probably want to start with the Season 2 set (which I start watching tomorrow). If you simply love the Six Million Dollar Man as a series, then by all means start with this set!",1425600000,,2651,4.737527114967462

El Hombre Nuclear (The Nuclear Man) was the best TV series I've seen so far in my 47 years of age, It was shown in the Dominican Republic fridays at 10 p.m. and we sat on in front of the tv from 7:00 p.m. viewing al the other series and programming until finnally the show arrived!! this was around 1975 here. I remenber I went to Puerto Rico on 1977 and the show as more advanced there than here, so I was bragging about the new and upcoming shows I saw before they were shown here in the DR. I also had the Six Million Dollar man and Maskatron dolls that i eternally played with, but the most amazing thing I remember about the series was Oscar Goldman's phone in a tobacco box in his desk...coolest of all desk phones.",1421539200,,1108,4.280952380952381

It's a simple but enticing story of how an American hero and astronaut becomes an even more extraordinary man after surviving a nearly deadly accident during a test flight of an experimental aircraft by having his damaged body parts replaced by bionic replacements by a genius scientist and the government. To repay his debt to both, he becomes an agent for the OSI (Office of Scientific Intelligence). A government agency that supervises government scientific and engineering programs of a top secret nature for the American government. As an agent, he battles secret agents, mad scientists, enemy governments and even more bizarre threats to America's security using his bionic abilities, but also his resourceful brains and talents and heart.

The one thing that really jumped out at me is the amount of swagger that Lee Majors exhibited in the role of Steve Austin.

The level of iconic episodes with outstanding guest stars in the first season is also great including; Day of the Robot John Saxon, The Rescue of Athena One Farrah Fawcett, and Burning Bright William Shatner among many others!  Special mention must go out to the outstanding cast of TSMDM including Richard Anderson as Oscar Goldman and Alan Oppenheimer as Dr. Rudy Wells they both fill out the background in supporting Majors in bringing real drama to each show.

On the plus side, I'm so glad they replaced the haughty first boss with ""Oscar"" Richard Anderson, & gradually gave his character a more personable, less bureaucratic attitude. I feel that reduced the ""government"" element of the show, especially during the tumultuous Watergate period, to greater emphasis on the real hero, which helped give the show more ""staying power"" for later seasons.

2390004,5,B000ANDBTY,"After I made this purchase I was looking forward to the delivery with anticipation. I was a big fan of this series as a teenager and I was wondering how it would hold up after all this time.

I wasn't disappointed. Unlike many series with sci-fi components, the writers didn't overreach. Rather than trying to get too technical about the artificial limbs and eye the story outfitted Steve Austin with, they simply showed mechanical parts and discussed a nuclear power source and pretty much left it at that. They added nothing to make a tech savvy person roll their eyes, and only a little suspension of disbelief was required. (For example, most of the time when Steve uses his bionic arm to perform a feat of great strength the little matter of leverage is ignored ... many times the effort should have simply torn the arm from his shoulder LOL). Of course today science has gone a long way toward making bionic limbs come true, and we likely have this show to thank for the inspiration for that research.

Lee Majors was perfect for this role, and in fact displays a very believable amount of angst in the pilot movie as he ponders his amputations and the foreign (to him) parts and technology that will make him seem whole again. It would have been an opportunity for many actors to overdo those scenes and chew them up. Majors handled them with a simple dignity and angry depression that felt extremely true.

Like any of this type of specialty series, the early parts are more fresh and interesting than the later scripts where new ideas are increasingly rare. But throughout it was a lot of fun and Steve Austin made for a very satisfying super-hero.

As to the technical end these DVDs look great. The picture is sharp, even when I let the TV expand it to widescreen mode rather than its original 4:3 aspect ratio. The sound is clean and I haven't yet noticed any distortion, which is more likely to occur with background music than dialogue or special effects.

I hadn't seen any of these shows in literally decades, so this experience was like starting out all over again. I'm very much enjoying it.

Highly recommended.",1390953600,2,2130,4.636604774535809
2390005,5,B000ANDBTY,"I remember loving ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" as a young child in the 1970's. This was just one of many 70's TV series that I couldn't get enough of back then. All of the characters seemed larger than life and super cool. I dreamed most nights about entering the world of Colonel Steve Austin or other 70's characters like Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman), Wonder Woman or Charlie's Angels. But now, as I play these DVD's, I see something that I couldn't see back then...how awfully CHEEZY these shows are!! What held me in wide-eyed wonder as a child has now become a source of light comedy as Colonel Austin runs in slow motion or performs his stunts. My kids are in utter disbelief that these shows could have ever been popular, but in a world that's careening through moral decay and every type of ungodly thing, it's nice to look back and remember the good 'ole cheezy 1970's.",1390176000,,882,4.51875

The picture quality was surprisingly good. I've seen the same quality on some blu-rays. Only the scenic location scenes seemed grainy. As far as the special features, I wish there would have been more audio commentaries and behind the scenes documentaries or some interviews with Lee Majors, but the interview with Harve Bennett was very insightful.

2390021,4,B000ANDBTY,"I was way too young to remember if I even saw the first 3 pilot movies of SMDM in the early 70s. They are included on this set and have not been shown as movies on TV since the early 80s.  This set includes: Cyborg (aka The Six Million Dollar Man), Wine, Women, and War, and Solid Gold Kidnapping.  All in their original 90 minute time slot broadcast versions. They were subsequently rebroadcast in syndication as 2 part episodes with extra footage added to better fill the single hour time slots as TV shows back then ran about 49 mins - 51 minutes each. The first film was only 75 minutes long so a ""flashback"" version (To The Moon and the Desert Parts 1 and 2) was created to fill in more time. Those versions are not included in this set but rather on a bonus disc set that was included in the TIME LIFE video collection box. The original versions as presented here are grainy and at times, very bright, especially the opening scenes of the 1st plot movie which occurs on a very sunny day where the blue sky is almost white washed. Still the transfer is great for both sound and picture. The actual first full season begins with the episode ""Population Zero"" which is the first episode of the regular season.  This is season set 1 of 5, each available separately (at time of review Season 4 and 5 are not or may not yet be available separately, if you haven't bought any season yet, its cheaper, if still available, to buy the box set from TIME-LIFE as it will also include the first 3 movies in their syndicated 2 part form, and the 1980s reunion movies, which included the debut of Sandra Bullock.",1377475200,4,1603,4.37248322147651

series of his own by the network after The Big Valley. Well, this was it. Some episodes are better than others, both writting and acting. Some are kind of boring. My favorites are the ones with Farrah, of course. She had unmatched natural beauty....not much brains. Also, I enjoy the ones written by Star Trek TOS writter D.C. Fontana. Also, the ones with Star Trek TOS stars such as Arlene Markel and of course, Bill Shatner (his first season episode was kinda weird).
  All that being said, the premiss of the show was good but it needed better, consistant writting/writters.",1370476800,2,702,4.653225806451613

I only wish I had kept my action figures from my childhood!",1369094400,,340,4.044776119402985
2390029,5,B000ANDBTY,"This show so captured my imagination in the 1970s, and still does, that it embarked me on my lifelong love of science and technology!

Unlike other superheroes, Steven Austin was a mere mortal man, and the bionic limbs and eye that would not only save his life but make him ""better, stronger, faster"" than before was a technology that seemed possible!

I remember, in my naivete as a 10-year-old kid, asking my dad if I could have the operation that Steve had, even though my limbs and organs functioned relatively perfectly, so that, in my then scrawny frame, I could have and enjoy those bionic powers, and defend myself against bigger kids who were picking on me in school.  Of course, my dad's reply was:  ""It's just a TV show, Mike.  That technology doesn't really exist.""  It was so ironic to hear, on one of the supplemental disc's documentaries, that actor Lee Majors, who played the show's iconic hero, as well as members of the production team, get asked that same question all the time from amputees!

Here we get all three ABC movies of the week, followed by all the season 1 episodes.  There's not much I can add to the other excellent reviews here, except to say that it's amusing to hear how the show's opening title montage and theme song went through a major overhaul from TV Movie 3 to Episode One of the series, when Executive Producer Harve Benett, who would later produce many of the Star Trek movies, took over, and felt, as I did, that the series needed a new theme song.

With all due credit to Glenn Larson, who would go on to conceive and produce his ""little"" space epic called Battlestar Galactica, and who here, in addition to co-producing these movies, wrote the music and lyrics for this song, kind of a '60s-era soul song, simply called ""Six Million Dollar Man"", that has Dusty Springfield singing ""He's the MAAAAAN! with backup singers singing 'The Six Million Dollar MAAAAAN!'  Catch him if you can, beat him if you can, love him if you CAAAAN..."", sorry, Glenn...this song HAD to go.  Apparently, Larson felt that his song would help cement Lee Majors as a sex symbol, a sex MACHINE, a sex GOD, for the ladies, and it did, but then-new producer Harve Bennett and the execs at ABC rightly felt, as I do, that, since Steve was in the military, the series needed more of a militaristic sound.  Thank God the prevailing theme song was scrapped and was replaced, like Steve's human parts, with the more familiar militaristic drum and percussion-driven theme song, ingeniously composed by Oliver Nelson, who scored TV's Ironside, as well as multiple other shows and movies, that we have now grown to know and love.

It's also interesting to note that the iconic sound-effects, of the bionic arm and legs functioning (""chchchchch""), as well as the impact sound whenever Steve's bionic limbs connect with another object (""boompapapapapa""), are almost totally absent in Season 1!  The bionic eye begins to make its telltale mid-range pulsing noise (""boopoopoopoo"") about halfway through the season.  John Saxon, who would play a robot in the memorable episode, Day of the Robot, who squares off against Steve Austin in hand-to-hand combat, has the honor of being the show's first actor to enjoy having his actions ""scored"" by the show's first bionic sound-effect.  It wouldn't be until Season 2 when producers and ABC execs pulled out all the stops and courageously began using those legendary sound-effects whenever Steve bursts into bionic mode and performs a bionic deed.

Great show!  Great set!  I particularly enjoyed getting to know the great Harve Bennett, in his extensive behind-the-scenes interview on the bonus disc, as he explains, in great detail, why he made several creative decisions, mainly to take the show away from pure sci-fi and make Steve less of a robot and more human.  This was the right decision.

The rich characterizations and satisfying interrelationships between characters, bionic man Steve, OSI chief administrator and mission mastermind Oscar Goldman (played with great warmth and intelligence by Richard Anderson) and OSI scientist who developed and maintains Steve's bionic technology, Dr. Rudy Wells (who would be played by 3 actors) formed a strong bond of love and loyal, devoted family, a family that we welcomed into our own families, a family that we are now able to become embroiled in whenever we fire up our DVD players, a family that continues to endure.

Considering the source material, ABC and MCA/Universal's original master air tapes (going back to the 35mm negatives, if they exist, would yield an even better, stronger look...perhaps, if there's ever a blu-ray release...), the remastered transfers look terrific, even better than I remember this show looking when it first aired on ABC!

Plug in, charge up those bionic power cells, and enjoy.",1368835200,14,4823,4.91256157635468

You could never hear this word on the original broadcast clearly.

2390044,5,B000ANDBTY,"I was very young when ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" originally aired, so before the recent release of this show onto DVD (FINALLY) my memories were basically of bits and pieces, with no real memory of entire episodes (uh, except maybe the Big Foot eps that came later). On the one hand it's a shame this spectacular show was never syndicated (as least to my knowledge). That said, after purchasing season 1 it almost felt as if I was watching the series for the first time. There were scenes here and there that I recalled, but most surprising of all is how much I rediscovered my love for this series. Memories faded, I do remember loving this show as a young child. Now, as a middle aged adult, I seem to love it just as much. In fact, as mentioned in the title I chose for my review, this just might be the most FUN show ever created. I only wish I still had my Steve Austin doll since nowadays it's become quite an expensive collector's item. I loved everything about this series - all those years ago - and still do. Great casting! Great music! Great story lines!!! Great guest stars too!!!!

But back to the series and season one. I can actually recall seeing commercial advertising for the series premiere, although I have no memory of there being 3 pilot episodes. The first pilot - aptly titled ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" - is without a doubt my favorite of the 3 as well as my favorite episode of season 1. Even if this series had never materialized beyond the initial pilot movie (I'm so thankful it did though), the original pilot movie could easily stand on it's own as a wonderful, engaging and very unique t.v. movie. I had forgotten that Richard Anderson and the Oscar Goldman character were not featured in this first pilot; so glad he showed up in the second as I loved the character of Oscar Goldman as much as I loved Steve Austin. In this initial pilot we see an ordinary man - with an extraordinary job (astronaut) - doing what he loves to do and ending up in what could only be described as a nightmarish freak accident. Colonel Austin loses his right arm in the crash, along with his left eye and both legs that are too badly damaged to salvage. When he eventually regains consciousness and is told by Dr Rudy Wells the extent of his injuries my heart breaks for the young pilot.  Lee Majors realistically portrays the emotions of a man whose life is now changed forever. While lying helplessly in a hospital bed, Steve is heartbroken, depressed and even attempts suicide. Lee's performance is so convincing that I was literally tearing up as I watched a pilot I had not seen since 1973. Lee continues to give a brilliant and convincing performance as a man who eventually accepts his fate, agrees to the bionic surgery and slowly regains his life. We watch Steve Austin passionately struggle to use his arm and legs the way a baby first learns to grasp objects and walk. Soon afterwards he is confronted by a government agency that has not only funded his $6,000,000 surgery but is now expecting payback in the form of expecting Colonel Austin to become a government special agent. We see Steve Austin struggle with yet another life-changing decision as he tells the man ""I don't want to kill anyone."" So ladies .... he's not only an extremely handsome man, with a sense of humor and pleasant manner, who has been to hell and back - but also a man with high morals .... what more can any of us ask for, right? Ha!

The 2nd and 3rd pilots are entertaining in their own way, both with a James Bond theme. Surpass it to say that this is not exactly the direction that the creators of the original pilot wanted the series to take, and hence after the 3rd pilot there is a noticeable change in the show's overall style. Gone is Steve Austin as James Bond; now it's Steve Austin as the astronaut turned government agent we came to initially know in the first pilot movie. There are 13 FUN episodes, in addition to the 3 movies. It's difficult to select a favorite episode or two, but if I had to choose I'd probably say ""Population Zero"" and ""Dr Wells is Missing"" would be at the top of my list. Even though Lee was initially worried that the series might prove to be too campy (ala the very campy Batman series), the camp factor for ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" was minimal compared with Batman. O.K., so in two of season 1 episodes we are asked to believe that a mad scientist can create robots that look and act human (Day of the Robot and Run Steve Run), but the remaining episodes are less campy. All of the episodes are FUN to watch. Looking forward to adding the rest of the series to my DVD collection. I have season 2 and am getting ready for the release of season 3 (next week) - Yahoo!!!!!!!!!

2390052,3,B000ANDBTY,"Season One of the Six Million Dollar Man is very interesting viewing for a number of reasons and while it doesn't rank with the Season Two or Three Seasons in terms of overall quality, this may be an unfair comparison in some ways.

The First Pilot Episode and the two other pilots included before Regular Series Episodes started production provide the introduction to this great series.  The actual first pilot episode details his accident and reconstruction to bionics.  While well acted and an excellent story, you really do notice the missing ""Bionic"" sound effects that were so essential to the show.  This is most evident during his clumsy and laborious first attempt to use bionics to save a little boy trapped in a car about to blow up... The original Intelligence Organization Leader in this one was one Oliver Spencer, played by Darren McGavin who does a really great job as a crusty leader.  The Spencer character would rather have a robot than a part man/part machine agent because of Steve's human emotions getting in the way of total efficiency.  It would have been really interesting to see these two characters develop their relationship over time but D. McGavin (who seemed to be filming his ""Kolchak-Night Stalker"" Series around the same time)was apparently only along for the first pilot. The same goes for the first of the three Doctor Rudy Wells, ably played this first time by Martin Balsam.

The Second Pilot is really nothing like the eventual series at all and this is entitled ""Wine Women and War"".  It appears as though they initially envisioned the Steve Austin Character as a Bionic James Bond with all the trimmings (heavily accented ladies to kiss, white tuxedo and the water and boat scene seems straight out of ""Thunderball"") There is also a different and terrible theme song introduced in this one to accompany a pilot that drags considerably throughout.  Fortunately, the song and this approach was a quickly passing phase although the ""Bond"" concept is somewhat continued in the third pilot (""The Solid Gold Kidnapping"")with a SPECTRE like Counter Intelligence Organization, led by Maurice Evans of ""Planet of the Apes"" Dr. Zaius Fame! (sans makeup) The story is better in this one but they were still apparently working out the bugs of the series concepts.

Once you get through a mixed bag in terms of these three separate pilot episodes, the regular ""Season One"" Episodes emerge and there are some good ones to be sure.  ""Day of the Robot"" introduces the Robot Adversary built by Dr. Chester Dolenz, who appears in two episodes in year one (""Run Steve Run"" is the other) with the Robot played by 70's Stalwart John Saxon.  This episode also introduces the famous ""Bionic Sound"" although it is the Robot who uses it first...  ""Dr. Wells is Missing"" is a suspenseful episode set in Austria and which features the second ""Dr Rudy Wells"" played by Alan Oppenheimer.  ""Population Zero"" is a solid entry that deals with a disgruntled former OSI Scientist out to get revenge since he pet projects didn't get off the drawing board...  For Star Trek Fans, two alumni show up with William Shatner (Captain Kirk) in a lead Role (yep, he plays a spaceman but in our time period) in ""Burning Bright"" which features some of his classic over the top theatrics.  Also, George Takei (Mr. Sulu)appears briefly in a solid episode set primarily in Asia entitled ""The Coward""  This same episode also introduces Steve's Mother who would pop up from time to time in the series.  ""Little Orphan Airplane"" is a good one too, set in Africa, where Steve A. tangles with local army elements and assists a pair of Nuns who are caught up in the warring factions.  Greg Morris from ""Mission Impossible"" Fame shows up in this one and one of the nuns will be recognizable from her role as a motherly nun in ""The Flying Nun""!

Having not watched this since the syndicated run in the 80's and only recalling the goofier episodes from the later seasons like the BIONIC BIGFOOT episode I was really surprised at how slow paced and serious the shows tone was at the beginning.

Steve Austin was really unhappy at having become half man, half machine and the show took it's time to let you feel the pathos of his situation.  The pacing in these earlier episodes, particularly the pilot can be a little drawn out at times, especially compared to today's breakneck storytelling techniques but at the same time it's quite refreshing to see them linger on a shot of STEVE AUSTIN moving his newly bionic fingers and contemplating his situation.

The picture quality and sound are about what you'd expect and the packaging is topnotch. The show is a fun journey into television history. Now when are they re-releasing the 12 inch doll with the see through Bionic eye feature?",1353888000,3,1022,4.862068965517241

That episode was in this first season. Other guest stars are William Shatner and Farrah Fawcett. There's even a DVD extra that highlights the many famous guest stars in the last disc. Overall, I liked these first season episodes, but it wasn't as good as when watching it as a kid when it was first broadcasted.",1350345600,,651,4.572649572649572
2390070,5,B000ANDBTY,Six million man season 1 is great plus the tv movies were awsome i can't wait for season 2 to come out in october as well as seasons 3 and 4 and 5 sometime soon,1348531200,,160,3.6
2390071,5,B000ANDBTY,"My favorite episode of ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"" both back in the day and today, is ""Day of the Robot."" And my favorite portion of it is Steve Austin's fight to the death against the robot (played by John Saxon) in the episode's climax. The filming of the battle in slow motion, the neat and weird sound effects, and the perfect accompanying music score made this, to me, the most marvelous and memorable piece of television in, and from, the 1970s.

(One unintentionally humorous interlude occurs at the very beginning of the episode when a straining muscleman attempts to lift a massive but obviously fake barbell.)

""Day of the Robot"" is, of course, on this First Season DVD set. For that reason alone, I think the set is worth far more than the purchase price, and worthy of five stars.

My only regret is that this set became available only fairly recently in the U.S., and that as a result I had to wait almost forty years to see this fantastic episode again.",1346889600,,969,4.557471264367816
2390072,4,B000ANDBTY,"I was only in grade school when this series enjoyed its peak in the mid-70s, so my memories were still patchy.  However, I was instantly a fan in those days, as were most of my schoolmates.  We used to argue in the playground over who got to be Steve Austin that particular day, and one boy used to sign his papers using the fictional name!  While some of us might distance themselves from Six Mil (shorthand used by the creators) because it is so dated, I am glad to say this is not the case for me.  Despite some early continuity problems with the three pilot films, the series quickly established the complex (for 70s TV) relationship between Steve Austin's instinctive and Richard Anderson analytical characters.  Lee Majors has been criticized somewhat unfairly for his understated performance as the hero, but I believe he brought sympathy and humanity to the series.  Given the later seasons' mystical or sci-fi themes, this one has the most realism, and except for one or two weak stories, most consistent plotting.  I see this show as paving the way for later series such as MacGyver, which I also enjoyed as a teen.",1344643200,3,1125,4.680203045685279

2390075,2,B000ANDBTY,"This set somes with 2 or 3 2hr pilot episodes that I'd never seen before. They obvisouly hadn't figured out this character's style at that time because he wasn't the same at all in later years.  In these early episodes they were going for an angry rebel against anybody in authority, and a James Bond type with the ladies, which Lee Majors just isn't, by any stretch. And the opening sequences to those pilot movies are just awful! Haha! The ultimate in 70's cheese- not the same title sequence we all know.
Throughout the entire season there are no sound effects when ""Steve"" uses his bionic abilities. Hard to believe how much the sound effect sells that, but without it it's just dead boring.
What surprised me the most watching this is that I absolutely loved this show as a kid.  The episodes are very, very long with great spans of time between action sequences, of which there may only be a couple in an entire episode. I can't believe I watched these entire things back then without falling asleep. I'm glad it made so many of us kids in the 70's so happy, but this is one series (and season) I will not be continuing to watch.",1341532800,4,1135,4.451923076923077

  Try not to beat them up too badly, kid.  And watch that laser in your right eye!  Even Steve doesn't have one.  You sure you don't need his help?
  No, I think I can handle it, but I wouldn't mind Jamie Sommers being our new teacher.  I've got a crush on her.

2390078,5,B000ANDBTY,"Echoing the comments of other reviewers, I find that the show is actually much better than I remember it to be. First of all, the quality of the picture on these DVDs is as good as it gets - aside from the very 70's music and styles, it looks as though it were shot just yesterday. But aside from the fact that it looks better than it ever looked on a 70s TV set, the shows are actually sharply written, the acting is top-notch, and the style of filmmaking is patient and calm and does not pander to the lower common denominator in the audience. It's a rarity to find a show that is stronger than one remembers it - in every other case I find that shows I loved in my childhood are usually painful to revisit as an adult. It's a thrill to report that The Six Million Dollar Man is as good as it gets and worthy of the rabid fan base it built during its run. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",1339977600,8,896,4.067796610169491

I do not discourage anyone from buying season 1 or any other seasons, and its fine for those of you who only want a little taste of TSMDM, but I wanted it all, thus I bought the $200 box set, and glad I did. So, if you want a little taste, and want to buy this awesome show, season by season, or want to skip a season, or whatever, thats your thing, but I had to have it all, because this is my favorite 70's show ever.

The writing is superior and actors were terrific, the imagination in all aspects of this program or almost any program in the past are by far better than 95% of the junk that the public is being force fed in today's HD and digital market....like the song says ""give me that old time rock and roll"", goes for TV too.",1337472000,8,631,4.384615384615385

2390085,5,B000ANDBTY,"One advantage of being sick, is lying in bed watching TV.  The Six Million Dollar Man was just before my time, but I had watched a few re-runs.

The initial movie is good, but slow.  It could have been trimmed back pretty easily.

The 2nd and 3rd movies just don't work.  Steve Austin, James Bond style super-spy isn't appealing.

However, the first season of the TV series is really good!  Lee Majors pulls off the pilot/astronaut/hero really well.  Austin, unlike many TV characters, isn't an idiot.  Two guys show up claiming to be guides, Austin tells them, nicely, to get lost!  Most TV characters would just blandly go along with the bad guys.  Goldman is much more human in the TV show, and you can really believe he and Austin are friends.

Love having English subtitles on the shows.

This is also one of the few TV shows that I watched all of the special features on.  There is a long interview with Harve Bennett that is really worth listening to.  Not just because he agrees with me on the 2nd and 3rd movies!",1334620800,2,1021,4.4728260869565215
2390086,3,B000ANDBTY,"I remember this show as my favorite for Friday nights in the 70's, now I watch an episode and it doesn't seem as good as I remember. Maybe season 2 was better?",1333756800,2,159,4.0
2390087,5,B000ANDBTY,"Does anyone remember the Six Million Dollar Man? Apparently, if your under forty, you don't know who Steve Austin was.  The pop culture phenomenon of the 1970's was portrayed by former ""Death Valley"" star, Lee Majors.
Steve Austin, was a former test pilot and astronaut, who almost died tragically in a test flight gone wrong. He lost both his legs, eye and right arm in a tragic crash.

However, the government rebuilt him with mechanical or ""bionic"" replacements.  After intense physical therapy he learned how to utilize his new limbs to work for the government again as an agent for the Organization of Scientific Intelligence or O.S.I.

Purchasing the season one DVD set brought back a lot of memories. I discovered there were three TV movies before the ABC Network committed it to a series.  There were quite a few good seventies guest stars.  Farrah Fawcett, Lee Majors wife at the time, played the first female astronaut in one episode.  John Saxon played a robot replacement for an OSI agent. Gary Lockwood played an unscrupulous assassin.

Little did I know that William Shatner was a character in the episode ""Burning Bright"".  He played a troubled man who was exposed to an unknown radiation that gave him extra sensory perception. He could stare at people and make them collapse by thinking about it.  It makes me think of that George Clooney movie ""Men That Stare at Goats"". For those of you who are a Shatner fans; he does his ham fisted acting routine.  He's channeling a  crazy version of Captain Kirk in an unintentionally funny episode.  His character meets a tragic demise when he climbs an electrical tower in an attempt to contact a friend who has long passed away.  From what we learn in the episode, he can talk to people in heaven and communicate with dolphins.  I do have vague memories of the episodes. They date back to 1973, so my recollection has faded.",1333584000,,1883,4.75076923076923

2390089,5,B000ANDBTY,"I want to correct something, they say the bionic sound effect was invented specifically for the Six Million Dollar Man, this is not true the series started as a movie in 1973 with out the sound effects and then used a few times in season one too show strength of Steve's stronger opponent. However watch tv series the Sixth Sense 1972 they use a variation of the bionic noise during some of Dr. Rhodes Psychic sequences in quite a few episodes. Since they hardly ever show that series even in syndication no one remembers. By the time the Bionic Woman series came out the Bionic sound effect had been firmly established by season two of Six Mill. The series stand up over time and still charming to watch. Six Million Dollar Man made 100 episodes compared to Bionic Womans 58. Lee really does alot more jumping than Linday does and many times Lee did the little hops himself. As matter of fact Lee actually had to have his knee caps replaced due to all the stunts he has done throughout many of his action series including the Big Valley and the Fall Guy.

It is good to be able to view an exciting TV series like The Six Million Dollar Man or the Bionic Woman in Italian. I shall want to collect these box sets!

I did not realise when I first viewed season 1 in English the emotional impact the conversion to being bionic it had on Colonel Austin as well as it had in consequence on his surgeon and furthermore on the big financier in a different way and on Oscar Goldman. At first the relationship was poor between the latter and Colonel Steve Austin but in time as we see it improved and they became good friends. I like stories like this whereby there is a positive turnover with the nature of the main characters and whereby the main character does not just neutralize or kill the bad guys but also helps the emotionally afflicted.

2390111,5,B000ANDBTY,"Ok, let me start off by saying that I was 7 years old when the first season of Six Milllion Dollar Man aired on tv. I have watched every episode at least 10 times. After many many years of waiting for this tv series to be released on dvd, the day has finally came!

I was probably one of the few dedicated Six Mil fans that didn't buy the time life set. I wanted too, but just never did. Anyways, now that the set is being released in stores per season, I can afford $30 every 3 months or so..

I did notice that the dvd set from Universal is exact to the Time Life release with one exception. Its missing the booklet you get with the time life release.

Universal did this in order to fit the season into one regular sized dvd case. They did use the episode lists there where in the booket on the inside jacket underneath the dvds.

Here is a breakdown of whats on the dvds..
Season 1--6 discs (all 13 episodes plus bonus features)
--Real Bionics featurette
--An Iconic Opening featurette
--Season 1 VIPS: A Celebration of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" Guest Stars
--Interactive Bonus Feature: Bionic Breakdown (clips that illustrate facets of the bionics)
--OSI Mission Debriefing: Executive Producer Harve Bennett

Of course the video and sound quality is fantasic for a 35+ year old show..Its like watching a new show again.",1322524800,7,1327,4.4896265560165975
2390112,4,B000ANDBTY,"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN was a TV show that ran on ABC from 1974-78 and was based on a novel Cyborg by Martin Caiden and pertained to a former astronaut Col. Steve Austin(Lee Majors)who nearly dies after being severly injured on a mission who gets saved by Agent Oscar Goldman(Richard Anderson)from the Office of Scientific Intelligence & rebuilt by Dr. Rudy Wells(Martin E. Brooks)with surgical bionic implants similar to his love-interest Jamie Sommars(Lindsay Wagner)on its spin-off series THE BIONIC WOMAN, which debuted on ABC 2 years later in January of 1976.

As a result of Steve's bionics, Steve had a bionic infrared left-eye kind of like Jamie had an amplifying bionic right-ear along with the fact that Steve and Jamie would occasionally team up together in crossover episodes between THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN & THE BIONIC WOMAN.

Additionally, Lee Majors had opened the minds & hearts of audiences across the world to an era when we were starving for superheros especially when we had a knack for being able to help mediate problems to a point where the only resolution was by the hand since THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN introduced a new concept to our world of robots & cyborgs in order to enhance his ability to combat everything that was evil since Steve inspired us with hope along with the fact that the premiere of THE BIONIC WOMAN was inspired by THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN as well.

Unfortunately, even though THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN lasted longer with better ratings than THE BIONIC WOMAN did, THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN cancelled in the Spring of 1978 shortly just before THE BIONIC WOMAN was, due to severe declining ratings since viewers felt that both Steve Austin and Jamie Sommars ran out of steam and were probably starting to get too much of the same thing every week since THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN & THE BIONIC WOMAN were too closely related and premiered too soon from one another, plus both shows were probably starting to lose a lot of viewers when creator(Ken Johnson) had THE INCREDIBLE HULK make its debut on CBS in March of 1978, which lasted 3 1/2 years since the Hulk was cancelled all of the sudden in November of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change of management at CBS.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*William Shatner in the ""Burning Bright"" episode after his co-starring days as Capt. Kirk on STAR TREK & before his co-starring days as Sgt. Thomas Jefferson Hooker on the police drama T.J. HOOKER

*Farrah Fawcett in ""The Rescue of Athena One"" episode before her co-starring days on CHARLIE'S ANGELS

*Anne Scheeden in the ""Burning Bright"" episode before her co-starring days as Kate Tanner on ALF

*Colby Chester in the ""Population Zero"" episode before his co-starring days on the YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

2390115,5,B000ANDBTY,"In 1973 ABC debut a television series that would become a pop culture phenomenon of the 1970's, ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". That series would propel Lee Majors into superstardom, lead to a successful spin-off called ""The Bionic Woman"", huge merchandising sales with dolls and board games, and become one of the network's biggest prime time hits.

 For years ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" did not see a DVD release due to licensing issues with Universal and its original creators, but in 2010 the entire series was released through ""Time-Life"".

2390116,5,B000ANDBTY,"Every year, I get a new DVD for my 9 year old son for our summer road trips.  Last year, it was the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew from the 1970's and this year it was season one of The Six Million Dollar Man.  Like last year, my kid loved it.  It was nostalgic for me and new for him.  The more '70s stuff I introduce to my kid, the more he likes it.  You forget how slow developing these 70's shows and movies are.  I think my kid will be bored and he's not.  Weird, considering all the fast moving TV of today's standards.  My only knock on this DVD is that it's hard to find and way more expensive than other items similar in nature.  Why this is not released everywhere is beyond me.

2390118,4,B000ANDBTY,"A little cheesy after all these years, but a nice, clean TV show that the kids can enjoy without all the foul language seen in modern sitcoms.  Honor in the main character is nice, a change from today's ""heroes"" that are just foul-mouthed and filthy-minded.",1281398400,6,257,4.711111111111111
2390119,5,B000ANDBTY,"There are many things American companies do that puzzle me, but this has to be one of the top 5: Why would you (as a company) have a show that is so iconic that people who have never SEEN it would still recognize references to it, and NEVER release it to DVD -- even in the year when you attempt to revive the concept franchise by re-making the spinoff ""Bionic Woman""? (I won't even discuss the incomprehensible decisionmaking process that decides to utterly change the entire basis of THAT show...).

When I purchased the first season of The Six Million Dollar Man, I expected it to be a purchase purely for nostalgia. In fact, I was braced to end up being UNABLE to watch the show (I've found it hard, for example, to watch MacGyver or Kung Fu, two other nostalgia favorites of mine).

To my utter surprise, in some ways this is a BETTER show than I remembered. The writing is tight, often clever, and LESS stereotyped than I was prepared for. (For example, the first major appearance by the Soviet Union's forces is not as adversaries!) Oh, there's stereotyping and events-of-convenience galore, but they're worked into the plots which are less simplistic than many of the follow-on TV action-adventure shows, and overall better acted. (The early movies are not entirely consistent with the series -- besides a change in some actors, the nature of Steve's relationship with Goldman and the OSI undergoes a fairly radical shift; for that reason I am focusing here on the actual TV first season rather than the movies)

It's clear that the producers, actors, and writers were still trying to ""work into"" the overall concept and try to figure out a way of keeping the action and the characters balanced. The actors -- specifically Lee Majors and Richard Anderson -- make it work. Steve is a man who has, with great difficulty, overcome the shock of becoming part man, part machine, something he had not asked for and not been prepared for, and has come to accept that he's been given a gift that carries terrible responsibility with it as well. Oscar Goldman is a quintessential spymaster who has, through his interaction with Steve, found himself forced to become more human than is, perhaps, encouraged in his field, in order to keep the friendship and loyalty Steve offers.

One very nice touch is that Steve Austin's background as an astronaut is, surprisingly, at least as important as his bionic secret for many of his missions. The ""superstar"" nature of astronauts, especially in the era of this show, is recognized and used appropriately. Being one of the astronauts who actually walked on the moon makes Steve special in a number of ways, including the ability (in what was a more relaxed era, surprisingly) to sometimes just gain access to locations and the confidence of people who would otherwise be terribly suspicious.

The adversarial relationship of the United States and the Soviet Union, as I mentioned, is present, yet is not overblown. Given the era and the setting, it would have been trivially easy and even understandable to demonize them, make the Soviet Union behind almost every plot, providing Steve with ready-made villains to trash. Instead, the worst enemies are invariably rogue organizations -- terrorists, obsessive scientists, conscienceless weapons dealers, spies with their own agendas -- and, often, simple nature and human error.

This is a world in which it's assumed that people are, at heart, not only mostly alike, but mostly preferring to get along. It's the exceptions, the men and women who don't CARE about other people at all, who cause most of the trouble in the world, and one man with dedication, a clear vision ...and perhaps some nuclear-powered additions... can often triumph and make the world a better place.

The bionics themselves are more carefully worked out than I had expected. While certain limitations are clearly originally intended purely for story-opportunity purposes, they're generally used consistently. Moreover, the classic opening animation can now be stop-framed and examined carefull, as we could never have done in the old broadcast days, revealing that the producers/designers had put a great deal of thought into the bionic capabilities. The numbers don't *quite* add up accurately, but they're not all that far off compared to what a slapdash and handwavy approach to the technology would have produced.

In the first season, many of the iconic features are still being ""worked out"". Occasionally we see Steve running, not in the classic slow-motion bionic run, but at the actual speed his running would require. These scenes merely reinforce the CORRECTNESS of the decision to make the 60mph running sequences slow-mo; in slow motion, Steve running looks dramatic. At what would be actual 60mph speed, he looks SILLY.

Similarly, the classic ""bionic sound"" is missing in most of the first season episodes, and in fact is first heard as a sound accompanying a humanoid robot, rather than one from Steve's bionics. It isn't until the second season that the standard sound effects (bionic strength use, ""bionic jump"" sound, and bionic eye) came to be regularly used.

Overall, this is a surprisingly good series even today. I really wish that  we'd get a USA release of this -- especially for the WHOLE SERIES, as apparently even overseas only seasons 1 and 2 have been released. This means that many of the classic later episodes are STILL unavailable on DVD no matter where you order from.",1227916800,63,5467,4.963934426229508

Do your research and search Google for DVD region code hacks, or unlock codes. You may find that it's a very easy task to unlock your current DVD player to play disks from ANYWHERE in the world. In fact, many DVD players simply require a special code that you input from the remote control! That's right, just press a few buttons on your remote and you can watch DVD's from ""ANY region""!!! Also, this is FREE information, NEVER pay anyone for an unlock code!

There are also VERY cheap ""all region players"" that sell here on Amazon for around $30! The PHILIPS DVP3140 is one such player. Do your research and free yourself from this horrible situation!

Also, make sure you VOTE this election. It's time to get America back on the right track (and restore the value of the dollar and America's reputation around the world)! Not to mention, take care of our own citizens!

I'm not telling you WHO to vote for, just get out there and VOTE!!!

All 3 of the original Pilot movies, the complete first season, and a handful of very excellent and well done bonus features. In short, this is the SMDM set we have been waiting for, and I am glad Universal finally got their head out of their collective asses and gave us what we have been waiting over 30 years for.

No one needs to be told what the show is about, as far as I'm concerned, the concern should be about the quality of the product, and they really delivered.
