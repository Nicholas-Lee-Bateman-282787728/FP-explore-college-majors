7796971,3,1568551800,I purchased this book years ago.  I'm sure it's quite outdated by now.,1406851200,,70,4.384615384615385
7796972,1,1568551800,Received the video in a timely manner.  Video quality was poor.  Images were grainy and copy didn't run well though all other vhs tapes run fine on my video player.  This was intended for use in my german language class but I am not sure I will use it.,1127692800,,252,4.1020408163265305
7796973,4,1568551800,"If you've seen Rick Steeves on TV, you know his narration is monotone and shows sometimes a bit corny.  However, this video does not disappoint.  Rick takes you through the major tourist attractions of Vienna and Salzburg but gives the same amount of attention to rural off-beat Austria's wonderful lakes, mountains and villages.  After visiting this beautiful country, I didn't think I could find a video that could capture what it felt like to be in both of these extremes, but as long as I can put up with the narration (maybe turn the volume off!), I do get that feeling with this video.  Highly recommended.",973728000,13,612,4.745283018867925
