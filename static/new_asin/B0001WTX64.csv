2034546,5,B0001WTX64,I bought the dvd because I wore out the Abs Of Steel video tape.  I haven't even watched the other workout on the dvd but just for the abs workout alone it is worth it.  It has a lot of great exercises which I prefer rather than doing a ton of situps.,1123200000,9,251,3.8076923076923075
2034547,5,B0001WTX64,I was impressed by both segments of this DVD. The buns portion really gives you a great workout and gets your blood pumping. The abs portion is different not the traditional moves you normally see. It is a nice change to break up your workouts.,1121731200,6,244,4.444444444444445
2034548,2,B0001WTX64,"I found the pace too fast to follow the complicated dance-like movements.  There are frequent,fast, rotational-type movements that are not good for the knees.  May be a good workout for those with dance experience, but it is too complicated (and ineffective due to the effort lost from missing steps) for those of us who never had formal dance training.",1111622400,19,353,4.966101694915254
2034579,3,B0001WTX64,"I guess it was a good work out over all, but its NOT for beginners.  I'm in pretty good shape I just needed to tone up a little and this work out is hard-core.  I couldn't do more more then 5 minutes at a time.  Maybe that's just me, but I wouldn't recamend it to anyone starting out.",1168300800,,284,3.8620689655172415
2034580,3,B0001WTX64,"See the other reviews about the BUNS section.

Here's what I think about the ABS section:

If you are a beginner that likes eighties music(Gloria Estefan, Madonna, etc), then you may want to give this video a try.  Otherwise don't waste your time and money

(Instead, I would recommend the much more effective ""Firm Parts 5-Day Abs"" and ""more 5 day abs"".)

This Buns of Steel video is very boring.  The motions don't really fit the songs they picked, so it feels like you're doing a few randomly timed moves to cheesy background music.

This video isn't that intense of a workout (even though the instructor claims that this is the toughest ab workout in the world). There aren't that many reps of any particular movement, and there is also a lot of time wasted doing motions that don't work the abs.

For example, it starts out with about 10 minutes of doing Marching in place & Step-Touches (while flinging arms), interspersed with several random squats and lunges.

Then there is about 20 minutes of the following (overall not that intense, unless you are a beginner):

Leg lifts in front while standing up (this works the hip flexors more than the abs)

Crunch variations

Bridge position and lift 1 leg up  (this is a great butt exercises, but doesn't do much for the abs)

Reverse crunch

Push ups

Lift body facing floor (I don't see how this works the abs  or any other muscles for that matter)

Plank

Leg lifts while laying down (works hip flexors and front of thighs)

Oblique twists w/ Bicycle legs

Leg lifts w/ crunch

Oblique twist

Side leg kick (this is a great hip exercise)

It ends with a few stretches.",1163289600,14,1623,4.594405594405594
2034581,3,B0001WTX64,"I tried this because i Wanted a DVD, not VHS, but just ordered another copy of buns of steel with greg smithy on VHS. I almost don't want to give away the secret, but greg has much much better and intense bun excersises than this workout could ever offer. All Robin does is sway her head back and forth and say ""come on"" while she just does squats over and over and over. Watch out for your knees because you could injure them if you do lunge after lunge at this pace. The number one thing with targeting muscles is form, not quantity, she doesn't go over form! Greg Smithy does go over form and he really targets the inner working of your buns and gets rid of cellulite. and he does floor excersises that isolate muscles. If you want thighs like a transvestite than do these lunges all day. If you want a nice [...] than do Greg Smithy's tape.
  Abs on this are good though, so i don't totally regret the purchase",1152144000,12,914,4.247126436781609
2034582,5,B0001WTX64,"I had not done any aerobics other than treadmill for quite a while, so Buns of Steel was challenging at first. First started doing a little of the workout and added a few minutes each time.  After a month added the Abs the same way - gradually.  The first half of the Abs section is not as physically demanding as the Buns, so it may be the best one to actually start with to get into the habit of exercising.  Within 1 month without dieting have taken about an inch off buns and an inch off thighs - much firmer!",1148169600,4,513,4.11
2034583,5,B0001WTX64,"I haven't exercised in a very long time and I am a beginner.  I have found that these exercises work my abs and buns good.  Dawn leads the abs section.  She does a pretty good job of it.  She has great abs.  She is not annoying at all.  Robin leads the buns section.  She is very annoying and says I am with you all the way a lot, but she does very good bun exercises.  A lot of the bun exercises are fast, but in time I will be able to keep up with it.  The music is good for both of the Buns and Abs of Steel sections.  Overall, awesome workout!!!  Highly recommended!!!",1147996800,3,572,3.9298245614035086
2034584,3,B0001WTX64,"This is a good workout for beginners, but people who work out regularly will not find it challenging. I barely broke a sweat, and Dawn, who does the abs section, is annoying.",1144713600,2,174,4.46875
2034585,4,B0001WTX64,"I originally had a VHS Buns and Abs of Steel that I liked but was an hour long workout.  This DVD is 2 half hour workouts, one for buns and one for abs.  This works out nicer for me because it's easier to make time for them.  I have been doing the workouts for about 3 weeks now and I still can't finish the abs one because you do a lot in the ""push ups"" position and I need more strength in my arms.  But I will get there and I obviously need more strength in my arms!",1143158400,4,469,3.7551020408163267
2034586,4,B0001WTX64,"I found this dvd at a local supermarket and I was shocked that it was only 5 bucks!

The ab portion of this video is amazing. The leg part is a little tricky but when oyu think about it that is probaly what makes it so effective if you can keep up.

Definetly will help improve balance as well.",1143072000,2,294,3.9661016949152543
2034587,5,B0001WTX64,"I had bought the original VHS tape in 1997, but my VCR broke.  I was upset because this buns workout is great and I thought that I would not be able to find it on DVD. If you don't like to get on the floor to do excercises then this is the tape for you.  Nothing is done on the floor and your buns will be ready for full bathing suit exposure. There are three basic excercise sections 1. In-line skating, 2. Kickboxing, and 3. Ballet.  Some excercises (kickboxing section) are difficult to learn and to balance, but with time, it will be worth it.  Just do the best you can in that section.  This DVD also has an ABS section, but I have not tried it yet.  Highly recommend this Buns of Steel.",1142812800,6,692,4.126865671641791

8017167,4,B0001WTX64,"I had the Abs of Steel workout on VHS tape until it was destroyed in my last move. I love this workout. It has a great deal of variety, so I don't get bored doing the same repetitive move over and over. When I was in my dancing prime, it was more like a warm-up, but appropriately effective. Now that I've been a few years from active dancing, I can still keep up. It's also nice that they keep pace with the music, so all the steps and pulses are in time. The Abs workout is 1/3 upright and 2/3 floor work. It's not too hard on the knees. One of the best parts is that the ladies are all smiles, and the music is upbeat. It's a happy workout. I give this part 5 stars.

The Buns workout is not as fun for me. It's all upright, and basically 30 minutes of squats. There isn't a lot of variety to the moves, so it gets boring really fast. Honestly, I've never made it all the way through, because I get bored. I usually switch to another video. Also, because most of the exercises are squat-based, it can be hard on the knees. There are some good moves in there, and some nice techniques, so it's worth going through to build a repertoire of exercises. After adoring the Abs video so much, this one was a sore disappointment.

Robin rocks. She's so cheerful. I'd totally work out with her every day.",1388102400,,1298,4.1673306772908365

8017171,5,B0001WTX64,This DVD is great. I actually got these on VHS in the mid 90's so it's good to know I can purchase both Abs and Buns on the same dvd. The workouts are great for both the abs and buns however I think the buns might be harder to do then Abs. But I feel great when I work out to Both and I always notice nice changes to my body as I continue the work outs on a weekly bases!,1176076800,3,371,3.5925925925925926
