978725,3,6305165882,"I laughed all the way through it.  Very poor movie script.  I don't know whether this whole movie was intended to be funny or if the writing was just that bad.  But who doesn't enjoy a young Keanu.  I don' t even know who Crispin Glover was in the movie, lol.

Terrible acting all the way around with the exception of Keanu who was young and it showed.  I was shocked at how bad Hopper was too????",1506384000,,397,4.090909090909091

978729,5,6305165882,"I watched this movie a minimum of 5 times when it was first released. It was so original back then. I don't know if it's held up over the years, but it was creepy, intriguing, scary, odd, wonderfully acted. The lighting was before it's time (about eight years before cross processing); the blue hue works well with the subject matter. The cinematography is beautiful.

The subject matter was/is rather grim,  but again,  in the 1980s the look and feel of the film was new.

Film reviews we must take into account when the film was released;  what came before it, but not after. Hindsight.
(That's a different argument than whether or not it stands the test of time. I'll update my review when I watch the film again.)

This is not for the faint of heart, nor is the subject matter my normal cup of tea, but it was a perfect counterpoint/compliment to John Hughes films (I loved The Breakfast Club and a few others) and the silly high school boy humor movies that flooded the high school genre at the time.",1498867200,,1005,4.4945054945054945

978905,3,6305165882,"I thought I'd turn this off after the first fifteen minutes. Crispin Glover as Layne, a mad, hyper, teen-ager is hard to watch at first--all through, although after a while you sort of get used to the over-the-top performance. And it's surrounded by a sometimes-interesting ensemble of teen (looking) actors. Dennis Hopper is a weird--lots of intentional weirdness in this film--older man, a recluse with only one leg, a large gun, and a doll with whom he dances indoors. And the whole thing is set in motion by one of these teen's murdering his girl friend: for no particular reason, with no particular emotion, but with ultimately dire consequences. There's also a ten (?) year old who seems to drive his parents' car--although his feet don't seem likely to reach the pedals. Lots going on! it works itself out, but never quite adds up. Oh yes, the young Keanu Reeves. Umm, he's just fine.",1485820800,,891,4.792207792207792

978907,3,6305165882,"A difficult movie to watch, this film is even more difficult to rate.  The cast of familiar stars is impressive, with each member providing quite a good performance in their own way.  Crispen Glover in particular delivers a character that is unique and interesting, completely surreal, and oddly depraved.  Keanu Reeves keeps his performance steady and targeted here compared to other performances that he gave us during the era this was filmed. Ione Skye plays it safe as a character much less mature than what we a used to.  And, it's got freakin' Dennis Hopper.
The plot and the style manage to survive underneath the weight of the talent, but just barely.  It's kind of a Heathers meets Blue Velvet.  The setting is grungy and cold and grey. I felt frustrated waiting for some sort of redemption, as the characters react to each other and their situation so unconventionally.  Overall, this movie is oddly refreshing and interesting.  And, it's got freakin' Dennis Hopper.",1484006400,2,976,4.9447852760736195

While the remaining characters were attempting to follow the narrative, Crispin's character was in a movie, (world) of his own...just weird.  A young Keneau Reeves did as good of a job as possible, given the plot, or lack there of.  But what really warrants the 2 stars given is the idea that the entire student body failed to see the importance of murder.  That's not reality.  You don't just see the dead body of one of your class mates and then show up to school the next day like nothing's happened.

Most distinctive is Crispin Glover's decision to play the character of Layne, a speed freak teen with skewed ideas about friendship and loyalty, in a highly stylized ""hyperreal"" fashion. But the film also has memorable characterizations by Dennis Hopper, Keanu Reeves, Ione Skye, Daniel Roebuck, and Joshua John Miller as Keanu's shockingly amoral little brother.

Misguided and often confused, we see how this tragic event is twisted into some romantic test of loyalty.  Turning against each other and fighting for some direction in the moral ambiguity of their lives.

The budget might not have had much but the director and writer tell a great story, along with great performances by the cast, flush out this dark and all too real world.  Great soundtrack. A great movie!  Still holds up after all these years.",1467849600,2,691,4.532258064516129

980239,5,6305165882,"This is an older movie and one of the first ones Keanu Reeves starred in. I don't know how this one has passed by me all of these years because this movie is a true gem. It is loosely based on a true event where a boy killed his girlfriend, shows no emotion or remorse, and even takes his friends to see the body. He isn't proud of what he's done - he's just completely ambivalent. Unfortunately, so are his friends when they see the body of their murdered friend. They are so numb and detached from reality the magnitude of what has happened doesn't touch them. Some of his friends, brilliantly played by Crispin Glover, try to come up with a way to ""save"" their friend from being caught. His friend doesn't really care about being saved, though, and none of the other kids really ever get on board. The dynamic between the teenage kids and their parents is truly sad and apathetic. Keanu Reeves' character has a sweet, close bond with his little sister and a very contentious relationship with his younger brother who is a truly frightening character. Dennis Hopper plays an eccentric recluse whom the kids use to get drugs from. He ends up playing a pivotal role in the movie and I think is the only character that truly realizes how dangerous the boy who killed his girlfriend is. The acting is superior, the plot is based on true events and the story is very well told. When the movie ended I had kind of a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. It's not often a movie moves me the way this one did. It is definitely worth watching - at least once. I'm happy to have it as part of my movie collection. It's a well made film and a well told story.",1452729600,7,1651,4.311897106109325

This is a great picture of disenfranchised, drug-addled, uncaring youth.  The kids in this movie are, unfortunately, a pretty good representation of a good number of kids in society and the message remains powerful all these years later.

Dennis Hopper and Crispin Glover absolutely steal the show in this movie.  Crispin Glover's speed-freak character is played with an absolutely perfect technique.  He REALLY sells the character and disappears into the role.  Dennis Hopper does his usual incredible job as Feck, the drugged-out, insane murderer who supplies the kids with ""the Feck weed.""  His character actually manages to be sympathetic and full of sorrow.  Keanu Reeves, who I normally find to be a terrible actor, does a really excellent job, and, like Crispin Glover, he just melts into the role.  This is the role for him, as he was also enjoyable in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.""",1438300800,,986,4.963414634146342

981256,3,6305165882,"""River's Edge"" was recommended to me and I remember the ads for it when I was a teen but unable to see ""R"" rated flicks. Having seen it recently as an adult, it feels like an attempt to be a David Lynch film starring teen protagonists but whereas Lynch somehow and quite mysteriously tethers together all of his surrealistic images and exaggerated characters into a fascinating whole, ""River's Edge"" feels like a jumble. There are some interesting ideas but none of the characters are particularly likeable but I think that's the point: It's a view of the existential indifference of people to the lives and suffering of others. I must admit that the response of the characters isn't entirely unbelievable since modern adolescents often seem completely self-absorbed, border-line sociopaths. Don't believe me? Just think of the terribly and intentionally cruel invectives teenagers shout at their parents (we did the same when we were that age). Upon discovering the dead body of a classmate and friend who was murdered by another friend, all involved are remorseless with the slight exception of Keanu Reeve's character and only at times.

If you're a misanthrope you will love this movie. I didn't hate it but I also don't recommend it because, again, the characters are ultimately so aloof and without empathy that the viewer is as detached from the characters as they are from each other. Watch ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Wild at Heart"" instead: Brutish movies that still have heart and characters we care about.",1412121600,,1507,5.00398406374502

981263,5,6305165882,"I've seen this film several times, and it was on the MGM ""free"" channel the other night in HD.  So I had to record it, and I watched at least the first act again, and it didn't disappoint.  It rarely ever does, even after multiple viewings.

And that is surprising, since the much-maligned Keanu Reeves stars, and I think that he might just give the best performance of his career in ""River's Edge.""  Peeking around the web, it appears that it wasn't his first film, but it surely was close; he'd only been acting professionally for about a year before the release.

While I've always thought that ""Lord of the Flies"" was overrated -- I believe that I've read the book and seen the film, from memory -- I did like the idea that the writer and director here use some very similar themes to drive this modern-day morality tale.  In particular, you will find the role and acting by Joshua John Miller to be quite chilling; I believe that he was only about 10 or 11 when this was being filmed, and you will see how far a young kid can go off the rails without enough guidance.

And of course, there are many other players -- Crispin Glover, who seems to be best playing edge-case-at-best characters -- and Dennis Hopper, who was almost always great.  And Daniel Roebuck seems to be the perfect choice to play the killer.

And he still was that perfect choice, even though I believe that the real killer for whom this film was based was actually black.  I've been to Milpitas quite a few times, as that town is only about an hour's drive from my home, and I will say that it's a great place to buy a gun for protecting yourself from animals such as these.  But I've never visited the location where the body was found.  (I wouldn't be surprised if many people have, although personally, I don't think that it's as macabre in general as most people like to say.  Usually, that is only used as a cheap ad hominem to keep people from visiting actual crime scenes, in my opinion.  After all, cops visit crime scenes and nobody has a problem with that.)

I think that this film is probably more like a 4.5, but I'm rounding up today as it's one of the most underrated films out there with similar subject matter and themes.  And it especially deserves a high rating, when you consider that Mr. Reeves is in it and he's actually really sharp.",1395619200,,2331,4.411214953271028

Parents were non existent in their child's life and the ones that were had no goals to raise their kids.
For me the lack of any morals to even feel after a death is to far fetched to imagine. Keanu Reeves does his 60 ies hippie impression while trying to remain out of the influences of the rest of the group.
I had a hard time liking any of the people depicted in this movie.  If Denis Harper tried to make everyone watching hate him, he did a good job.

Unless I simply overlooked the obvious (which wouldn't be the first time, heh).  It's a really strange and ultimately fascinating drama about a teenage boy who tells his group of friends that he's killed his girlfriend and that the body is lying out in the woods by the river.  At first everyone is convinced he must be joking, but soon we realize the dreaded reality check that he's actually telling the truth.  I mean his friends are convinced he's joking to the point that they actually walk up to the body and poke it with a stick!

One of the friends (played by a remarkably young looking Keanu Reeves) has a younger brother who's WAY too mature for his age and insistent on being a teenager by experimenting with drugs, illegal activity and other things in order to hang with the big boys so to speak, to the point that he occasionally plays a role in the cover-up of this murder with his one nunchuck-swinging friend.  Meanwhile the mother of the family is trying her hardest to keep everyone in check but by nightfall, they all leave and go their separate ways.  It's a chaotic mess basically.  To add more to the confusion, the boy who murders his girlfriend actually meets a strange old man who lives alone and has an obsession with a human-size doll.  The two of them form a friendship.  Strange stuff indeed!

River's Edges is honestly compelling the entire way through with several curious moments of wondering how this complex storyline is going to end, and I think it ends on a really spectacular and satisfying note.  Ione Sky is a BEAUTIFUL teenager and she's one of the friends who threatens to spill the beans to the cops on one occasion, but upon realizing that she's too involved in the twisted complexity of the storyline, she ends up having a change of heart.  Sometimes -when the murder makes the news in one example- the situation between the friends gets rather heated, suspicious and thrilling.  What will happen to the man who murdered his girlfriend?  What will happen to the friends that didn't come forward with the knowledge of the murder right away?

Considering this movie came out in 1986-87, this is when the heavy metal scene was fully underway so you'll hear plenty of heavy metal music similar to Iron Maiden, Metallica and others throughout the movie.  I like this music so I consider the soundtrack really good.  Also, be prepared for lots of nudity as they continue to show the naked dead girl lying on the ground whenever the friends drop by to figure out what to do with the body.

Overall, an oddly compelling drama and that's putting it lightly.  Worth watching.",1362441600,2,2783,4.629327902240326

981565,4,6305165882,"This movie is timelessly horrifying and timelessly powerful. Drawing inspiration from a real-life event, screenwriter Neal Jimenez and director Tim Hunter tell a tale of a senseless, reasonless murder and the almost zombie-like apathy of the teenagers who know the murderer as a friend/acquaintance, see the corpse afterwards and yet decide to keep silent. Some people have called this movie implausible, but when we seem to read every day about kids killing other kids over clothes or teenagers opening weapons fire in elementary schools, is it really? This movie mines the same terrain as BLUE VELVET, namely a seemingly normal town hiding a deep secret that rears its ugly head out in the open, making the viewer want to flinch but still watch. The acting from Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper and Joshua Miller is taut and believable, and the cinematography of Frederick Elmes (long-time DP for David Lynch) further gives this movie a polish with a very noticeable hint of grime on top of it.

981569,4,6305165882,"""River's Edge"" (1986) was based on a true story that took place in 1981: a high school student murders his girlfriend and tells his friends at school about it; the group goes to view the body in the woods but they're so apathetic and spiritually bereft that no one informs the authorities and the body just lies there for a couple of days. Daniel Roebuck plays the lumbering murderer and his clueless friends are played by Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover and Ione Skye, amongst others; Dennis Hopper is on hand as an aged biker/hippie.

What struck me about the film was how much it reminded me of real life experiences, both as a youth growing up and also as an adult dealing with youths. Here are some of the things in the movie that I've also experienced:

- Kids as young as 11-13 obsessed with ""partying."" - The idolization of drugs (pot, pills, etc.) and the party lifestyle above all else. - Kids, that young and older, out all night doing whatever (partying, having sex, crime). - Parents who aren't much more than phantoms in their kid's lives and therefore allow such. - Older, crazy dudes that the youths sometimes hang with, get drugs from or look up to. - The group dynamics of such youths and the unwritten law of not being a ""narc."" - Killing a friend and leaving the body where it lies for a couple of days.

This was (and is) the downside of the 60's revolution -- a somewhat sad emptiness in people who have lost their innate moral compass with the passing of religious faith as they desperately search for meaning or cause in the new secular frontier (Layne's ""cause"" in the film is rigid loyalty to John, since he had ""his reasons"" for murdering the girl, and covering up his crime). Most of the characters are neither likable nor unlikable; they're just human beings trying to live and find meaning or fulfillment with the hand they've been dealt.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in California (Sacramento, La Crescenta and Los Angeles).

BOTTOM LINE: Glover steals the show with an over-the-top (yet believable) performance in a film that details the dark side of coming-of-age in modern America. It plays like a mid-80's version of Coppola's ""The Outsiders"" (1983), which was about early 60's youths; note, for instance, the seemingly incongruent melodramatic score (there's also a great metal soundtrack, but the songs are merely soundbites). People who have grown up in loving homes with positive role models & friends probably won't like ""River's Edge."" They'll likely think it's trash. However, those who grew up in the dysfunctional insanity depicted in the film understand it fully. And many of us are doing everything in our power to prevent our kids and other youths from experiencing it.

""A bunch of us are going to check it out,"" one girl tells another. ""It's probably some joke.""

But, the kids are going to visit the body by truck loads. They literally convince one of them to cut work to ferry a bunch of kids out to the riverside so everyone can see.

""Nobody has to find out.""  Layne (Glover) the self appointed ringleader of the young people, tells the group. ""There are a lot of people here, we bury her so she doesn't have to be found."" Their ersatz leader is doing his best to keep the gang together, to get John out of town when the police start searching for him because Jamie's dead and they can only help John.

One of the boys' big adult role models is Feck (Dennis Hopper) an ex-biker who admits to having killed a girl he loved with his gun.  Feck provides the kids drugs and plays a key role in John's escape attempt.

It seems, the only kid concerned is one girl, Clarissa (Ione Skye) who is too afraid to call the police because John might hurt her next. And still her reaction is muted.  ""I couldn't cry for her,"" she confesses. ""I could cry for that guy in ""Brian's Song"", but I couldn't cry for her...""

All this is juxtaposed with a little girl's grief over her lost toy. The toy gets a burial and a grave marker.  The girl's death is hidden.

""I don't know how I felt,"" Matt (Keanu Reeves) the kid who eventually told the cops, said when asked about seeing the body of the girl.  This is pretty much a reflection of the reactions of most of the kids who've witnessed the girl's body.

Finally, near the end when John's situation gets desperate, he tells precisely why he killed Jamie. The situation goes from bad to worse as the kids are frenzied by John's act run rampant around the town, committing robbery, assault, etc.

""The River's Edge"" literally had me on the edge of my seat. There are enough holes and inconsistencies in the plot and bad acting by some of the cast to have me shaking my head, I doubt I will forget the film any time soon.

981878,5,6305165882,"A quarter of the way through watching River's Edge, I was having trouble putting my finger on the right adjective for the film or the way it was making me feel. ""Discomforting/uncomfortable"", ""appalling/appalled"", ""disturbing/disturbed"" all floated around in my head but were insufficient to describe the sense I had of a horrific...absence of something. I mentioned this to the friend who had been responsible for our movie choice of the evening, and he summed it up: ""it's a negative image of the good"". That was it. Or to put it in the words that came to mind shortly thereafter, as two degenerate 12-year-olds shoot crabs in a bucket for mild entertainment, ""All wrong."" Everything--everything--was just all wrong.

At first, this might seem appropriate, even inevitable, given the film's subject matter. River's Edge begins with a dead body; Samson, a high school Neanderthal pothead played convincingly by Daniel Roebuck, has killed a female classmate of his--for essentially no reason--and then tells his friends about the crime. The rest of the film follows the aftermath as hyperbolic Layne (Crispin Glover) makes it his (and their) mission to protect Samson, while Matt (Keanu Reves) and Clarissa (Ione Skye Leitch) act indecisively on a vague discomfort with this course of action.

But few films dealing with murder intentionally omit any internal viewpoint of morality or justice in the way that River's Edge does, and this is what makes it compelling and thought-provoking as well as deeply unsettling. On the back of the box, Matt is described as ""struggling with guilt"" over the decision not to turn Samson in, and indeed he does go to the police fairly early in the plot. Ah-ha, you might say, here is our standard of judgment. But numerous clues throughout undermine Matt's claim to moral objectivity, any strong sense of rightness that could shed light on the other characters' nihilistic apathy and dissoluteness.

Indeed the lack of deep feeling is a running theme throughout the film. Several of the adults accuse the kids of the crime of apathy--and yet we and they are presented with no appropriate example of feeling, no appropriate object for it. Clarissa's high school teacher idealizes the accomplishments of his generation (""We stopped a war, man""), Feck--the kids' drug dealer--accuses Samson of not loving the girl he murdered...like Feck had loved the woman he had killed many years ago. Every passion in the film, it seems, is misdirected, whether toward the trivial (more than once is rage expressed over beer) or the perverse. Samson's explanation of his crime--that he did it to ""show everyone who's boss"", that it made him feel ""alive""--is chilling enough to shake the beliefs of the most devout Nietzschean.

Their reactions vary. The group's leader, Layne (Crispin Glover), argues that Jamie's dead so there's nothing they can do for her, but they can save John if they dispose of the body and all keep their mouths shut. However, Matt (Keanu Reeves), may be the only member of the group with enough empathy and courage to do the right thing... Although fictional, ""River's Edge"" was inspired by the true case of Marcy Conrad who was murdered by her boyfriend Anthony Jacques Broussard in Milpitas, California, in 1981. It isn't a great film, but it's interesting because it was one of the first to explore the milieu of what would soon become known as Generation X. Strung out on dope and failed by their absent or useless parents, these kids are too jaded to feel anything, even in the face of death. Through one of their teachers, Mr Burkewaite, Neal Jiminez's screenplay points to a contrast between these Gen X slackers and their politically-engaged counterparts in the 1960s. Also, their aging dope dealer, Feck (Dennis Hopper), killed his girlfriend, too, but under pointedly different circumstances: unlike John, he loved his girlfriend and killing her wasn't simply a way of feeling more ""alive"". But such times have passed. For these kids, the only apparent choice is between copping out and conservatism. It's a simplistic position, and the screenplay isn't as nuanced as it might have been. Still, it's a reasonably engaging film. How you respond to it may well be a function of how much you can tolerate Crispin Glover. Admittedly, his unique performance style suits the slightly crazed Layne but, as always with Glover, it borders on unintentionally funny and this tends to dilute the impact of what's going on. By contrast, Keanu Reeves enthusiasts will be pleased to find an early film in which he actually acts. Similar ground is covered by Larry Clark in ""Bully"" (2001), another true-story adaptation, where the kids are more complicit in the crime.",1135123200,8,2174,4.942622950819672

It's a terrifying story about troubled teenagers, how they discover their classmate killed his girlfriend and how they act in this situation. Their indifference and unconcern shocks and intimidate as we see another latest X-generation waste their lives. ""Rivers's Edge"" is disturbing in the last degree and at times very hard to watch but it's the kind of a movie that really touches your heart. The director Tim Hunter showed remarkable talent in this work and it's a pity he didn't make something noticeable since then. I'd like to mention the cast which is also great - Keanu Reeves (who's interesting to watch at that young age), Dennis Hopper (who's good as always) and Crispin Glover with Daniel Roebuck who both played just awesome, maybe it was their best part ever.

""River's Edge"" make you ponder about todays youth but you know - the film (which by the way was based on a true story) was made about twenty years ago, so now those kids must be in their late 30-s. And they must have grown up into decent clerks, fathers  etc. They hardly all became criminals. So I guess every time has its ""lost"" generation. But then they somehow find themselves.

His acting is frighteningly real, and incredibly skilled for a guy in his early 20s. All the professional critics at the time accused Glover of overacting. I thought he was great. His skill pierces through the screen and captures your heart; here Layne (Crispin) is going out of his way to help his friend to the point of psychotic numbness to the reality. I discovered this movie about a year ago (when I was 14) but it is timeless in capturing youth apathy to life. Simply put... INCREDIBLE. This is definitely a cult classic nowadays, and is worth checking out.",1127779200,4,855,4.631578947368421
982037,4,6305165882,"""River's Edge"" is probably the most important film Tim Hunter ever made.  It will probably leave an extremely bad taste the mouth of the casual viewer, which is in all likelihood the point.

While this film is based on a real incident that occured in the mid-80's, since then there have been dozens of similar cases.  What makes this film special is that rather than taking a coldly objective or ""documentary"" style approach to the event, it makes an attempt to involve the viewer in the daily lives of apathetic youth, and to point a big index finger at the failure of family, society, and the kids themselves to generate some real concern or emotion over the death of another human being.

Pretty much everyone knows the story: a high school student murdered his girlfriend after her having refused to have sex with him, and then babbles to his friends about it, none of whom told police.  The performances in this film range from mediocre to spectacular:Crispin Glover steals the show as young psychopath Layne, an iconoclastic figure in this twisted circle of ""friends"" who attempts to rally the youths into hiding Samson (Daniel Roebuck) and evoke some feelings of loyalty toward him.  Since none of the figures involved ( with the exception of Keanu Reeves, who once again proves that he can play a less than intelligent burn out very, very well, it's almost like he's not acting) are capable of emotion over their friends' death, Layne's frenzied mission is doomed to failure from the start.

Dennis Hopper is one of his less impressive roles here as Feck, a reclusive biker/murderer who gives loopy lectures to the kids and sells weed to Layne.  The striking thing about the situation is the apathy that practically flies off every scene: Samson, the young killer, seems less affected than any of his peers by what he has done.  After leaving Jamie (his dead girlfriend) he goes to the local convenient store in search of a six pack of beer.  We gradually come to see that he is perhaps more insane than anyone else, even Hopper, who also murdered a woman decades ago and has a blow up sex doll as a substitute--and he's the good guy.

I'd watch this film simply for Glover's performance, which oscillates between being manically charged to mired in total defeat.  It isn't so much about protecting his ""friend"" as it is about trying to get some sense of connection with his peers.  But everyone seems lost in their own orbits, and in the last scene, when the police are arriving, we see the young Layne lying on the grass, defeated.  This is a film which deserves more attention, as I'm sure it will take on a more prophetic quality as time goes by and more and more things like this occur.",1099180800,7,2699,4.666666666666667
982038,5,6305165882,"I remember when this movie first came out.  I watched it again tonight and have to say I believe I was more disturbed this time around then my first viewing.  As a teenager the most significant thing that stuck with me about this movie was the body and how she was left by the river.  This time around it was the apathy of the whole group of friends and the push/pull between brothers Matt & Tim.  I'm not sure what my group of friends would have done if put in a similar situation.

Since the 60's our society has been on a rapid decline.  Each generation has had some form of social inadequacy.  In the 80's we were all slackers, even the so called jock/pinheads of our generation.  Drugs, alcohol, and sex were the norm.  Kids across all economic backgrounds were part of the latch-key generation, unsupervised, under stimulated.  Our role models were the musicians we listened to and the music videos we watched.

True, movies today seem to grip harder.  Show more blood and guts.  Are far more graphic.  This movie though cuts to the solid core of my generation.  We were a bunch a slackers, drifters without a moral compass by which to guide us.  Only a nagging feeling or voice if you will, in the back of our heads as to what was right and what was wrong.

I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie again.  It was well worth the time.  Dennis, Crispin, wonderful to say the least.  Keanu pulled off an extremely good performance and considering I have really considered him eye candy until now is saying a lot.  Joshua Miller really and truly disturbed me the most.  Bravo.

The resulting angst, confusion, guilt and conflicted peer-pressure loyalty issues makes for cracking drama, and the talented, well-directed ensemble cast is more than up for it. Crispin Glover steals the show with a decidedly weird, but compelling performance as the ""alpha"" of the teen pack. Co-star Dennis Hopper once stated in an interview that of all the young actors he has worked with since he appeared in ""Rebel Without A Cause"", Glover comes the closest (in terms of acting presence, not 'looks') to capturing James Dean's ghost. Keanu Reeves turns in a great performance, making it even more puzzling why he has since evolved into such an inert mannequin onscreen. The most interesting aspect of the film is that the more times you see it (and it does stand up to repeat viewings) the more darkly comic it becomes; not ""ha-ha funny"", but ""funny"" in the same way ""To Die For"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" are ""funny"".

This doesn't keep just about everybody her age from gawking at her now stripped corpse when it's found along the river's edge.  Various reasons keep Samson's peers from even alerting the police to the body - mostly they have to do with loyalty.  In a bizarre twist, their loyalty stems not from Samson, but from his friend Layne, a local Death-Metal kid who is determined not to ""narc"" out one of his own.  While the rest remain silent, Layne makes Samson's safety and escape his personal crusade.  Matt (Keanu Reeves) stirs from the pack, and calls the police.  At first a suspect (he can't explain to the police the delay) Matt's released, whereupon he pretends to help Layne keep Samson safe.  Most of the film is confined to the late hours of a single night, when our characters split up and tragically collide.  When police flood the streets looking for Samson, it's clear that somebody ""Narced"".  Though Layne never suspects Matt, Matt's younger brother immediately fixates on his elder sibling's betrayal, and plots revenge.  At first, Layne stashes Samson with Feck (Dennis Hopper), an elder pot-head who's on the run for murder, but Samson is too impulsive to stay in one place for very long.  When Feck runs out of beer, the pair leave the safety of Feck's house for beer, bullets and a trip back to the river's edge.
""River's Edge"" is a stirring flick, but it's not quite the statement of society's collapse that it purports to be.  (A nebbish, conservative student is put-down for just that sort of self-righteousness late in the story.)  Just too much of the story doesn't add up.  Matt's mom is simply weak - she's got a bossy live-in boyfriend, and looks to be have barely recovered from the sort of teenage existence now suffered by her kids.  (instead of being emboldened, she's actually the weakest character in the flick - ""I'm not your mother"", she rants near the end ""You're all mistakes!"")  Matt's brother plots revenge for Matt's treason - but he never connects with other characters in a way that suggests his loyalty.  The other's are supposedly in sway to Layne, but Crispin Glover's mannerisms are less death-metal than post-modern mime (he simulcasts most of his lines with his hands) and he can barely hold himself together, let alone his peers.  While separated from Layne, Matt uses his new-found inner strength to get closer to Clarissa (Ione Skye), but the story isn't sure which is really causing the other (maybe Clarissa is actually inspiring him to think past Layne).  Especially weird is the way that while Layne searches for Samson, Matt runs into him at a liquor store after hours.  There, using Feck's gun, and in front of Matt, Samson forces the storeowner to sell Matt beer.  Matt never tells Layne of the meeting.  The biggest hole is Feck.  The flick tosses him and Samson together in a night that climaxes with something out of ""Of Mice and Men"" - but the script only partly succeeds in creating that intimacy between Feck and Samson.  When Feck later says of Samson ""he didn't love her"", it's unclear whether he's referring to Samson's murdered girlfriend or to Elly, Feck's blow-up doll and captive passenger on that last night.
That said, this is still an incredible flick.  Crispin Glover is still unforgettable as Layne (after watching enough of ""Edge"" you may find it hard not to talk like him).  The plot, for its holes, stays focused on that one last night.  If the ending is way-too-pat, it's probably because the flick's ambition is more than it can achieve.  In any case, I sat down for this click and couldn't pull myself away.  Supposedly based on a true story, ""River's Edge"" should be appreciated on its own, without us having to wonder where the true story became a way-out cautionary tale of impulsive murder and misplaced loyalty.",1074988800,15,4196,4.802228412256268
982041,4,6305165882,"Back when this came out in the late 80s I always thought of this movie as something of a companion piece to Blue Velvet. While it's not quite as ""in your face"" as that film, it is still an extremely disturbing yet riveting piece of cinema. Watching it again now on DVD it has lost none of its power. The portrayals of the nihilistic stoner youth are spot on - especially Crispin Glover as the hyper-kinetic Laine - and it's directed with a subtle hand that never allows the material to slide into melodrama. Rewatching it, the only thing that did seem a bit over-the-top was some of the incidental music - a bit too self-consciously ""foreboding"" at times.",1026345600,2,655,4.512605042016807
982211,4,6305165882,Just a note about the DVD: The lack of extras is disappointing. It'd be nice to think there'll be a future release with a Tim Hunter commentary. And it seemed to me that the framing is all wrong. It looks as though the picture is blown up resulting in information lost on all four sides. Or maybe a cropped-at-the-sides 4:3 copy was taken and that was then cropped at top and botton to get the 16:9 shape.,1008028800,3,405,4.2727272727272725
982212,4,6305165882,"Okay, okay.  So we know it's a great movie, right?  Dennis Hopper in what I consider to be one of the top 5 performances of his career, the nice girl naughtiness of Ione Skye (who I've never truly resolved my love for) and the incredible Crispin Glover in what is definately his best performance.  It's over-the-top, it's preachy, the music's great...not to mention that it contains dead-on portrayals of disenfranchised youth in flannel shirts well before the grunge movement.
But how does the DVD format enhance the viewing?  It's really a very basic release.  You won't find any fancy extras in this package, but it's really not priced that way, either.  The widescreen is great to have and it certainly looks a lot better than my old worn-out VHS copy, but that's about it.
The movie is a must-own for Hopper and Glover fans (not to mention the last tolerable Keanu Reeves performance) and it's only a slight disappointment to not see any new material.  Until the movie gains the ""classic"" status and warrants a collector's edition DVD package, this will do.",1004400000,,1062,4.802197802197802
982213,5,6305165882,"River's Edge is a deeply disturbing film that is fast transcending cult status to becoming a bona fide movie classic. When a classmate (Daniel Roebuck) murders his girlfriend for no rational reason, self-appointed group leader, Lane (Crispin Glover), draws together their circle of friends to protect him in a misguided test of loyalty. Haunted by the senselessness, two decent-minded kids (Keanu Reeves and Ione Skye) grapple with their consciences before Reeves' character eventually tips off the police, well aware of the danger he faces for breaking the conspiratorial code of silence. Sadly, River's Edge has proven to be an all too perceptive and pioneering examination of the increasing nihilism of American youth since the 1980s. The increasing regard with which it is viewed by critics and collectors has been helped in no small way by events such as Columbine. The spate of school shootings by sociopathic teenagers increasingly beyond the control of teachers, parents and society seems entirely consistent with the bleak picture of American youth this film paints. As such it is the significant, depressing movie signpost for its generation, in much the same way as Rebel Without a Cause was for youth of the 50s. Unlike Rebel, (or even its own broad set of generational cohorts, from The Breakfast Club, the anachronistic The Outsiders to lighter fare like Reality Bites) the kids of River's Edge are not just alienated and misunderstood, but thoroughly nastier pieces of work - the products of a cynical, complacent and nihilistic late-Cold War sensibility. They are not crying out to be understood, but to be left alone. In this sense, its most obvious cinematic antecedent is Jonathan Kaplan's underrated Over the Edge (1979), which it resembles in more than a few ways. Despite the controversy associated with it, the movie's power derives from an understated, non-judgmental depiction of the inherent violence and depravity of its characters and situations. Equally, Reeves' character makes no grand, sweeping statements of principle and conscience. The ordinariness of his thinking in reaching his own conclusions on a thoroughly evil situation is the one ray of optimism as the movie reaches a conclusion of tentative hope. With none of the violence, boisterousness or sensationalism of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, River's Edge treads similar themes more perceptively and infinitely more shockingly. A must have - and the perfect, necessary antidote to all those John Hughes movies in your collection.",989107200,17,2529,5.325
982214,4,6305165882,"Black-Death-Speed Metal Teenaged Rocker Dudes and their hella fine girlfriends, living in white-trash Stockton and smoking dope that they stole from their burnt out parents, hanging out on the banks of the Sacramento River. Apathy, rage, anger, and a desire to fit in and belong while understanding that the future is guaranteed to be a bleak repetition of this cycle of working class poverty. Most adults are either hard case Reagan era suits or ""Alan Alda/Rob Riener school of self-awareness"" ineffectuals and either way are twice as befuddled about this generation as the parents of the flower children were about THAT generation. When the adults are freaks and things go terribly wrong in your little clique that represents the only GOOD things in your life, where do you turn? Do you even care?
Realistic portrayal of lower-class living in Northern California. Speed Freaks, Burnt out and disenfranchised adults, broken families and lots of testosterone and machismo. Yup. Growing up in the 80s as white trash sucked when the ""16 Candles elite"" was constantly flashed in your face. Wait until the 90s when Quake and Doom are released and ultra-violence is REALLY embraced by the socially outcast and desensitized youths. The kids in this movie were raised by kids that were already lost, and had little chance out of the starting gate. The movie is a study in futility and the apathy it breeds. Really an honest and insightful look at this segment of our society that doesn't try to pose any answers or solutions, and maybe suggests that there aren't any. Perhaps this movie is more of a Shakesperian tragedy about the inevitable courses of mankind than any kind of message about how the 60s generation eroded traditional family values. (I think it takes a huge stretch to see THAT message anywhere in this movie at all, or maybe just being clueless).
Yup. Don't let your kids watch this movie, they might think it is cool, grow their hair long and kill their girlfriend and smoke and have casual sex and do other really bad things. Hmnnn... But maybe if this movie triggers this kind of behavior in your kid, you've already got some problems there already, anyhow... :)",982195200,3,2175,4.897018970189702

Teenage murder ~ what would you do if a friend of your killed his girlfriend and bragged about it at school...
That's the dilemma facing a group of hardy, streetwise teens in thsi dark film.  Do you go to the cops or do you cover for your friend.
Keanu Reeves plays MATT, a boy with a conscience.  He gives a noticibly stunning performance as the angst ridden teen, fighting his friends and his family, trying to stay sane at the same time. It has been often said that this performance paved the way for his rise to stardom in Hollywood.
The other characters are dispondent and have almost given up on 'life' itself.  How can you burn out so young?  Where has innocence gone?
Dennis Hopper does a great turn as Feck, the weed smoking, ex-murderer turned judge and jury in this truly memorably film.
Great to see that it has been re-released in the States.  It has never gone out of print here in the UK...

982216,5,6305165882,"River's Edge is a shocking, real life, under-rated and very unavailible 80's cult movie. It about how a gang of teenages cope when a friend murders a girl and leaves her body naked beside the river. The haunting atmosphere and horrific imagery are comendable, but its the characters that really bring this film alive. They also bring some wonderful moments of unexpected humour (yes! It is funny!).
Okay, first and formost there's Crispin Glovers enthralling Layne. He is basically the only kid who reacts to the killing, however his warped morality makes him side with the killer. Glovers performance really lights up the screen and his character has a same weasely appeal as Mr Pink had in Reservoir Dogs. This is a truely special role.
But it doesn't stop there. I was also seriously facinated by the boy who played Tim (Damien was it?). The kid is hard as nails and had a burning precense. Then there's John (the all important role of the killer). The guy playing the character really looks like the blank psycho's you see on the news. A really hate worthy villian.
Denis Hopper is as good as ever playing the demented Feck and (Shock! Horror!) Keanu Reeves is pretty damn good as Matt. I used to be one of the masses of people who would slate Keanu's acting- but since seeing ""My own private Idaho"" and this, I'm having to eat my words.
I hope this cracking and important film will be widely availible soon. Teen films these days tend to be utterly souless, brain dead crap.",972691200,59,1479,4.648854961832061
