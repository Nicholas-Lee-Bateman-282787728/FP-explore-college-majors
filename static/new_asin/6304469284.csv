7873318,4,6304469284,"I love Bryan White. He's my favorite male singer. But this video does not do him justice. First of all it was a huge mistake to interview his grandfather for this video. He never talks about Bryan. All he wants to talk about is his cow industry which has nothing to do with nothing. Bryan talks a lot about his grandfather and these cows. I don't know about everybody else but when I watch a video about Bryan White, the last thing I want to hear about is cows. I enjoyed the interview with Bryan's mother and friends who discuss his voice and the wonderful talent he has. Bryan seems very awkward while he is being interviewed. I think he's just shy. The whole time he is standing in, what looks like, a very uncomfortable position and almost always has his arms folded. Thank God Bryan cut his hair. He looks horrible with long hair which is how he has his hair in this video. You can clearly see how Bryan has changed from then and now in his music videos. In the music videos he is very stiff. I don't think he felt comfortable in front of the camera then. I still don't think he is fully comfortable with it though. On TV during interviews he is very quiet and shy. But that's perfectly fine. It's his personality and he is who he is. His music, on the other hand, is not to be taken lightly. His voice is rich and beautiful and his songs are emotional and meaningful. Bryan hasn't turned out any new music in a long time and it looks like his career is on a downhill slope. That's sad because I think he has the makings of a legend. He just needs to get on the ball and work a little harder to get new music out.",996624000,,1618,4.189102564102564
