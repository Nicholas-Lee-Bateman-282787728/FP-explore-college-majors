We just quit watching because the fun just wasn't there for us. Too much bickering, not enough banter.",1476662400,4,249,4.555555555555555
7039175,5,B00UGQB1WO,"Wonderful example of the zany farces of the 1930's.  And, no one did it better than Carole Lombard!",1476489600,,99,4.5
7039176,5,B00UGQB1WO,"This is one of Carole Lombard's cute, sweet, zany comedies!  I am not that old, I just love good movies! Watch it, you'll love it! Enjoy!",1475020800,,137,4.269230769230769
7039177,4,B00UGQB1WO,"The boss of the man Carole is to marry transfers him to Japan so he has a chance to win Carole over. Its hard not to like Carole Lombard, and she plays well off Preston Fosters character in this battle of the sexes romantic comedy. Her continual tirades in this film wear a little thin, but she plays her role so well. Enjoyable, engaging and well worth watching.",1472860800,,363,4.352941176470588

8706360,2,B00UGQB1WO,Did not like the violence towards women as a comedy....who thought that was/is funny!!!,1505174400,,87,5.285714285714286
8706361,3,B00UGQB1WO,Fair.  Hardly one of Lombard's best.,1500508800,,36,5.0
8706362,4,B00UGQB1WO,"Ah, the wonderful Lombard!  I can imagine & they say it is true; that when Clark Gable wanted to date her, she wanted nothing to do with him, so she said, he chased her & Lombard got him.",1496448000,,187,3.9210526315789473
8706363,4,B00UGQB1WO,"Excellent cast, acting, directing, and screenplay! Of course, I'm being biased; Miss Lombard is one of my favorite
stars of the classic screen. And she's beautiful to top it!",1493596800,,174,5.0344827586206895

8706365,3,B00UGQB1WO,"Almost all of the Carole Lombard movies are the same. She plays a spoiled brat adult, so self-absorbed that nothing else matters except blocking the advances of the lovers that are in love with her beautiful self defeating character. I think in real life, the part she plays in her movies were her real persona, argumentative, manipulative, and attention-getting. But, all-in-all, she is enjoyable to watch even with the disorders that were her undoing.",1481155200,,453,5.135135135135135
8706366,4,B00UGQB1WO,Very funny screwball comedy. Lombard is delightful.,1477785600,,51,6.428571428571429
