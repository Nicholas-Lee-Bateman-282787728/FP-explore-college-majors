8503514,5,B006R927TA,This is an excellent DVD on Qigong.  Liu He is an expert and is passionate about her instruction.,1412380800,2,97,4.388888888888889
8503515,5,B006R927TA,"The video is very well made.  Easy to follow, very good picture and sound quality.  There are 2 -15 to 20 minute Qigong sessions.  I enjoy them both and can work them in easily into my day (I do Dai Mai Qigong in the morning before work and Nourishing Woman in the evening).  I followed along for a couple of weeks and now I am doing them without the help of the DVD whatsoever.  This allows me to focus internally.  I am new to Qigong and I feel like I made a very good decision with this purchase.  I will purchase the complimentary DVD ""Jade Woman"" in the very near future, and am looking forward to getting it.",1408492800,2,614,4.1525423728813555
