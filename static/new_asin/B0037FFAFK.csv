8390576,4,B0037FFAFK,"I first encountered this material in a work-sponsored seminar more than twenty years ago.  I was impressed then; still am.  I came across this CD at our public library last autumn and decided to ""take a refresher course"" because a lot of it didn't stick the first time.

The slogan ""I love humanity.  It's people I can't stand."" could be applied to me.  So, having information which helps me to give other people a little slack is huge for me.  The idea that other people are not necessarily wrong or behaving like jerks but simply seeing the world from a distinctly different place than I am leaves me not assuming the worst.

For instance, the presenter mentioned that, when a particular ""color"" (orange) says he'll arrive at 8:00, he probably means ""eightish"".  I think that he has made a commitment to show up at 8:00; he doesn't think that he has.  With this information, for as long as I'm willing to wait (no more than 15 minutes), I'm not spending my time the way I would like and I'm feeling disrespected (or maybe I little crazy because I was SURE that he said 8:00).

This material helps me to take better care of myself in dealing with others, while giving the other person the benefit of the doubt.  It also serves as a reminder to me to check with the other person about, for instance, ""what does arriving at 8:00 mean to you?"".  Which gives me an opportunity to let that person know how I respond to ""eightish"".  That way, I don't need to end up figuring that he lied, forgot about me, got a better offer, or whatever other unhappy conclusion I might reach in my attempt to understand ""what the hell?"" is going on with this individual.

Communication and relationships (however brief or long-term) can improve drastically.

I didn't actually love the manner of the presentation of the material.  But I think that it is easy to understand and to participate in the brief ""exercises"".  Also, I appreciated the examples the presenter used.  I've watched it alone, with a friend and with a family member (both of whom found it entertaining and helpful).  Lively discussions followed.

I purchased the CD from Amazon (fine service) and gave it as a New Year's gift.",1327276800,3,2175,4.614583333333333
8390577,5,B0037FFAFK,"This little CD makes sense of people you know who may differ from you and you never quite knew why. It explains the quirks and behavior of you and your fellow man in a truly humorous way. I would recommend this if you are into pop psychology and want quick  ""I can live with these answers"" solutions. However it does not define  those who are really crazy.",1283817600,2,356,4.298507462686567
