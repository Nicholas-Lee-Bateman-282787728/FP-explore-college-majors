8131981,5,B000GGSMFI,"I brought this series a while ago, in a different type of packaging....but I loved it just this same. I think people didn't like Reload and Reload Gunlock as much because of the original English voice actors didn't continue their roles. It's like one comment said before about this series....you got to give them a chance.

I say think about this way...New character designs, New continue plots, New English voice actors...BUT THE SAME GOOD OLD SAIYUKI!!!!!!. If you are a true fan of Saiyuki ...you will want it in your collection!!!

It's the same review I wrote for Gunlock but I really do feel the same about this I too.",1364342400,,624,4.663636363636364
8131982,4,B000GGSMFI,"This review will be short, because I am assuming you are here, reading this, because you've seen the original Saiyuki!

This show, ""Saiyuki Reload"" is an amazingly accurate continuation of the original story of 4 friends who travel west for reasons they aren't fully aware of.  The only problem I have with this show is the English dub!  The voice actors don't give the characters the same feelings!  I am super disappointed in all of the character voice except the annoying monkey-child.  Always fun to call him the annoying monkey-child.

The plots are original and just as involving as the original series.  The characters act the way you'd expect them to, and everybody's favorite priest still kicks ass.  If you love Saiyuki, try this one out... just PLEASE use the Japanese voice actors and read the subtitles.",1326153600,,816,4.905109489051095
8131983,5,B000GGSMFI,This is a 5 star anime for sure the lines are funny. Saiyuki is truly a great anime.,1269734400,,84,3.7222222222222223
8131984,4,B000GGSMFI,"The art style and animation quality (smoothness of action, etc.) are definitely better in Saiyuki Reload than they were in Saiyuki.

The Japanese voice actors are the same for both Saiyuki and Saiyuki Reload, and they're awesome in both.

Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, most of the episodes in Saiyuki Reload are fluffy filler episodes. The bath house (onsen) episode (episode 10) is terribly cute and funny, though, and Saiyuki Reload does cover the Kami-sama arc (episodes 17 through 25), which is very serious and pretty pivotal to the series.

The Urasai (behind-the-scenes clips) are funny too, and they come at the end of each episode.

If you like the Saiyuki series, you should at least grab the Kami-sama epsiodes from Saiyuki Reload (episodes 17 through 25, discs 5 through 7).",1174262400,10,804,5.068181818181818
8131985,1,B000GGSMFI,"Almost the entire Reload anime series (Season 3) consists of filler episodes.  A few of the filler episodes are cute (Jiipu story and Bath house story,) but most of it is just fluff until you get to the last disk.  Plus, the art is sloppy and feels thrown-together.  The animation is choppy, cookie-cutter and stiff.  Geneon's English voice cast is wooden and monotone.  It seemed like no one ""got"" their characters.  And there are very few extras on the DVD.

The art and animation in Saiyuki Gunlock (Season 4) is somewhat better...  but still not up to par with the original series.

Buy the original Saiyuki series (Seasons 1 and 2) and the movie (Saiyuki Requiem) that ADV put out instead.  The art is much more attractive, the animation is smoother and ADV's English voice cast is MUCH better.  Illich Guardiola was the perfect casting choice for Gojyo.  Oh, and the original series has a lot of extras on the DVD.

The only positive comment that I have about Saiyuki Reload the anime is that the Japanese voice cast in Reload is as good as the Japanese voice cast for the first 2 seasons.  Akira Ishida reprises his role as Hakkai,  and he is just wonderful!",1170547200,17,1165,4.587378640776699
