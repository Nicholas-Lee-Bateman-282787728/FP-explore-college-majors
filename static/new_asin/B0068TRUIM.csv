4979369,2,B0068TRUIM,I enjoyed the movie until the end. The end is total joke and makes no sense....Total cop out. There is very little explanation in what happens.,1323734400,6,143,4.538461538461538
4979370,1,B0068TRUIM,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Please don't be fooled by the several positive reviews on this page. Everybody praising this movie is either one of the Roccos in disguise or a friend/family member put up to it. It should be fairly obvious when pretty much every positive reviewer says something along the lines of ""Can't wait for more"", ""Great soundtrack"", ""I think this movie is real"", and ""better then Paranormal Activity"". Yeah right. You guys must be dreaming. The most comical fake review is the one that says ""Excellent dialog"". The dialog is easily the weakest part of this film. Nothing but UMs, UHs, and F Bombs throughout the entire flick. Half of these people have done reviews on several other Rocco products, coincidently always giving them 5/5 stars and saying its a ""must-have"". The other half of them have no other reviews, which should be an indication that the account was created for the sole purpose of creating a fake review. So yeah, they are obviously fake reviews and it is puzzling that Amazon hasn't caught on to this yet. Anyways, long story short, all the people arguing with the negative reviewers in the comment section for this movie are people associated with the film in one way or another, so don't be phased by it. They all threaten to report you if you talk ill of this horrid movie, but hey, the truth hurts. Amazon review pages are meant for truth, not lies. And I'm sure potential buyers would appreciate honest reviews over fake ones.

And with that being said, now on to my review.

CONTAINS SPOILERS

The acting was terrible. The characters were unlikable. The story was unbelievable. One ghost was a overweight man in a rubber mask, who simply walked around. Scary. Another ghost was what looked like a gothic woman standing in a bush in broad daylight. Frightening. The music was not needed, and when present, sucked. This is indeed a found footage movie, but easily one of the worst I've seen. The product is produced on a DVD-R and wouldn't even play on my XBOX 360. I returned it and got a replacement sent and the 2nd disc wouldn't play on the XBOX either. I ended up watching this movie on my computer's DVD-Rom because it was so cheaply produced. To be fair, this may however be Amazon's fault though, and shouldn't be considered part of actual movie review. Then Again, I've ordered tons of DVD-R on demand movies from this site before and they've all worked perfectly on any device so I wouldn't be shocked if it was the source file; the cruddy movie. So overall, a bad experience at every turn. I Don't advise watching this movie. Heck, it took me a week to watch the whole thing because I couldn't stomach more then 10-20 minutes per day. I have no personal vendetta against the people who made this film, but I do feel that the truth should be told and honest reviews should surface. Because honestly, all the fake reviews are quite sickening. To wrap up this review, the ending is a blooper reel. Really? It makes you wonder how all these reviewers could possibly think the film was real footage when it ends with outtakes... Did you guys even watch the movie or did the Roccos just tell you what to type? Pretty sad. AVOID this movie at all costs & please beware of future fake reviews from these people.

EDIT:

Since I wrote this, a couple of reviews have either been deleted or edited so that my claims will not seem valid. At this time I am not 100% sure if the users purposely deleted their reviews to spite me, or if Amazon finally caught on to their little charade and cleaned house a little. Either way, good riddance to them and now the overall star rating for this movie is finally beginning to show some truth of what people really think of it. This will be my last form of interaction with this awful movie or any of the people involved with it. Farewell.",1322265600,,3809,4.569546120058565
4979371,5,B0068TRUIM,"Now I loved this movie and no, I am not related to anyone involved in the making of this movie.  Just got it last Friday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I felt there were some geniune scares and to use a comparison, I watched both it and APOLLO 18 and enjoyed this one much more.  But I nearly fainted when I saw it now sells for nearly $1000.  It had better have more going for it (such as all four Beatles appearing on the soundtrack or Russell Crowe and Meryl Streep in the lead roles) before I would pay that!  But is it worth $10, $20? Yeah. it's an old school type horror film (reminds me of something from the 1980's, say) and has a simple premise.  The use of the F word is tiresome but as I said before the scares are genuine.  Is it like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY?  A little.  It's basically a haunted house movie.  What can I say without telling the story?  I enjoyed it.  No gore, no nudity that I noticed but the female lead wears really low cut blouses that would please young men (tho she is no Scarlett J).  The man wears no such revealing clothes but then again we are not talking Ryan Goslng here so that is no loss.  I just believe in equal opporunity ogling for we womenfolk.  Anyway, it's a nice way to waste 90 minutes or so.  But don't pay 999.99, ok?",1326326400,2,1264,4.161157024793388
4979372,1,B0068TRUIM,Movie started out slow..first half hour is worthless..movie gets a little better in the middle but the ending makes no sense and its for sure not scarey. I wouldnt watch this movie if it was free. Not worth your time.,1324857600,5,217,4.45
4979373,1,B0068TRUIM,Ive never actualy taken the the time to review a movie online but i feel so ripped off by this movie that i have to. The story line was bad the effects terrible. The ghost was a fat man that walked around in all black and mysteriously disapeared when he went around the corner. I completely agree with the other person that left the bad review saying that the good reviews couldn't be real. I didn't listen to the bad reviews and bought this movie my advice is to rent it first i promise youll still feel ripped off,1324598400,7,515,4.212121212121212
4979374,5,B0068TRUIM,"Never a big fan of horror, but this movie was well worth the watch. Worth every penny, nice job. will be watching and waiting for more.",1324339200,,135,4.230769230769231
4979375,5,B0068TRUIM,I am not a huge fan of horror movies but this came highly recommended from a friend and I loved it.  I think everyone should watch this movie and see for yourselves what the hype is about!  Awesome!,1324339200,,198,4.184210526315789
4979376,4,B0068TRUIM,"I liked the movie.
There was some dark and scary scenes, not to mention a good soundtrack.
Nicely Done!
Looking forward to more..",1324339200,3,129,4.6521739130434785
4979377,2,B0068TRUIM,"i should of listen to my gut,this was the worst ripp off i seen this year...thank god it was 2.00 bucks...",1324252800,3,106,4.095238095238095
4979378,1,B0068TRUIM,"An attempt at a ""hand-held camera"" horror mockumentary that was way too slow.

There were a couple of good bits, but the scene with the guy in black wearing the poorly fitting Halloween mask, and the scene with the little girl wearing poorly applied makeup really killed it for us.  The clincher was the lame ending... what happened to the main characters?  What happened to the original family members?

If the producers had spent a few bucks on a more realistic mask for the masked guy and a first rate makeup artist for the little girl, and wrote an actual ending, it could have been a much better film and we wouldn't have felt like we wasted 88 minutes of our lives.",1324166400,,671,4.475409836065574
4979379,5,B0068TRUIM,I found this film to be EXCELLENT. I'm a big horror movie fan & I highly recommend this movie to everyone who shares the same passion :),1323907200,,136,4.074074074074074
4979380,1,B0068TRUIM,This was easily one of the worst movies I have seen... ever! Not even the least bit scary. Acting was horrible. Ridiculous. Don't waste your money.,1323820800,6,147,4.6923076923076925
8494942,1,B0068TRUIM,"Dumb though in a few occasions creepy, but overall not very good with very poor acting special effects and a storyline that makes no sense. The characters call each other babe over and over so much that you are happy when they get what's coming. Skip it!",1356393600,,254,4.425531914893617
8494943,3,B0068TRUIM,"Hokey but actually pretty well acted.
Odd premise, odd special effects, worthy effort
Better than some of the higher production value movies out there",1355356800,,150,5.291666666666667
8494944,2,B0068TRUIM,"I am a fairly critical reviewer of horror, primarily because today it is so inexpensive (both in time and money) for most anyone to create a movie and upload it to Amazon and elsewhere, that there is a glut of absolutely terrible ""films"" on the market today (and I think that now that genie is out of the bottle, so this is the new reality of the horror movie genre). Anyway, suffice to say that I have spent a lot of my meager disposable income on streaming movies here on Amazon and on Netflix, with very few real creepy and spooky moments to show for it - especially with regard to ""lost footage"" films which are the most conducive to those no/low budget movies I mentioned. So it was with no small amount of surprise when I found myself genuinely creeped out by The Bake Street Hauntings. I won't give any spoilers here, and while this movie is not perfect, it makes up for its shortcomings (one big one being wayyy too many F-bombs - OH and the chemistry between the ""husband"" and ""wife"" is non-existent in those roles - they are more like a brother and sister who haven't seen each other in a while and are throw together and commence to the old nagging sibiling back-and-forth - you won't buy them as a couple, trust me) with a few - correction, more than a few - moments that brought me back to the same chills I got from Blair Witch, Session 9, and others. Part of it has to do with the dialog, which never seems scripted (pardon the pun) and actually seemed pretty genuine. I am guessing the director encouraged a lot of ad-libbing, which works perfectly in Bake Street. Good camera work, which also, again, made this feel much more believable than 90% of its kind in the low budget lost footage genre (especially with the lack of nightvision, which works extremely well here, and is fairly unique in this day and age when every horror movie has the cast using a nightvision-equipped home camera). I definitely recommend this one - and I recommend watching it in the dark, preferably alone, for maximum spooky factor (and yes I suppose most horror works well in that setting, but it works especially well here). I have recommended this one to my friends and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.",1352332800,,2214,4.523690773067331
8494945,4,B0068TRUIM,"Basic ripofff of Paranormal Activity but really cool and creepy considering it was very low budget, i liked it alot",1351900800,,115,4.8
8494946,4,B0068TRUIM,"This is a gimmick that's almost been beaten to death: ""found footage"".  This one isn't any worse than several other lame attempts to cash in on the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B003204MQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;(I thought that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Entity/dp/B002WSB5RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Entity</a>&nbsp;was actually rather good).  This movie actually has a few genuine chills.  There's also a couple of really cheesy and eye-rolling, ""you gotta be kidding me"" moments.  With only two main characters (unless you count the ghosts) I felt the movie worked on a more intimate level.  The characters struck me as fairly realistic, alternating between fear and nervous laughter.  Personally, in all of these movies, I have always wondered why people who suspect something paranormal is going on insist on going to bed with all the lights off.  This movie takes care of that by shutting off the power!  Unless you've been in a blackout, you don't really understand how dark ""no light"" really is.  In parts of the movie the audio is so bad, that you can't hear whatever noise is so scary; in other parts, the lighting is so dark that you have no way of knowing just what the heck is going on.  If you've got some time to kill, and aren't incredibly demanding, this made for a suitably spooky Halloween afternoon.",1351900800,,1503,5.981308411214953
8494947,3,B0068TRUIM,"Some creepy moments in this found footage film.  Starts off a little slow in an attempt to create a likeable couple.  Good storyline progression that if given a chance is a decent ghost story.  If you are a horror fan and have exhausted your prime and Netflix horror options, not a bad way to spend some time.",1350691200,2,309,4.385964912280702
8494948,1,B0068TRUIM,"This is clearly a ""do it yourself"" wanna-be scary movie. I kept hoping it would get better, but it ended up just being a complete waste of time. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I certainly would not encourage others to watch it.",1349654400,4,244,4.104166666666667

8494950,1,B0068TRUIM,"Very laughable and I was sober!! Since when does a married gay call his wife ""dude"" or 'bud"". Maybe he was thinking he was with his gay trick or a transvestite. Really bad acting and rediculous make-up horror effects. Hope none of these people quite their fast food jobs!",1348185600,,271,4.551020408163265
8494951,3,B0068TRUIM,"I took a chance. Not bad, Not bad.
From reading the reviews regarding its low budget status, I was expecting the movie too be totally awful. It actually was not.  The movie had a couple of scares, a light sense of creepiness, good dialogue and an alright story line.  The grease painted face was too much over the top.",1344729600,,318,4.372881355932203
