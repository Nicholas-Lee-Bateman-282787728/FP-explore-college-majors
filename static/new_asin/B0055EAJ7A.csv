4573991,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Kenneth Branagh's film version of ""Thor"" packs an awful lot of story into an hour and forty-five minutes. By all rights it shouldn't work but ""Thor"" manages to be an entertaining, action packed thrill ride that juggles quite a few subplots VERY effectively. It shouldn't be a surprise though given that Branagh has done this juggling act before but with ""Henry V"" (which along with ""King Lear"" and the Arthur myth provided inspiration for the story as seen by the director)and other densely ploted plays by the Bard.

Benefiting from a clever well written screenplay written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stenz and Don Payne(and based on a story by TV/film and comic book writer J. Michael Straczynski & Mark Protosevich which was, of couse, based on the comic book originally done by Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and Larry Leiber (Stan Lee's brother), ""Thor"" works so well because of the unifying vision of Branagh who sees the film as a comic book version of classic, action packed plays and literature. Chris Hemsdale (""Star Trek"")makes the main character appealing despite his vanity and ego as portrayed early on in the film while Tom Hiddleston does a fine job playing Thor's brother and main rival for the throne Loki.

Spoilers:

Banished to Earth because of his arrogance, ego and for almost breaking the peace with the Frost Giants by his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor finds adjusting to being a human a difficult experience. Scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is fascinated with Thor and believes he holds the answers to a weird scientific event that occurred in the New Mexico desert when he first appeared. He finds himself thrust into the role of Earth's protector when Loki unleases the Destroyed on Earth to kill Thor and when Loki betrays his people to help Odin's nemesis the Frost Giants come to power.

Spoilers End:

Fans of ""The Avengers"" comics should also watch for a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton aka Hawkeye and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson in a cameo at the conclusion of the film.

Updated for Blu-ray: The Blu-ray has a number of cool special features but I most enjoyed the cut/extended scenes and the director's commentary which was quite insightful.

Image quality was amazing truly a demo quality Blu-ray.

4573992,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Maybe the biggest feat this movie accomplishes is that it makes Marvel Comics' version of Thor pretty accessible to the general public, thus advancing Stan Lee's eeeeevil plan for world domination. The story splits its time between Thor's exile on Earth and the throne-ousting goings-on in the wondrous realms of Asgard and Jotunheim. By the end, you get a good sense of what the Thunderer is all about, and the worlds he inhabits. As per usual, there's plenty of beats and references to tie it all into big Marvel film continuity.

Thor Odinson, the Norse God of Thunder, is about as subtle and retiring as his war hammer, mighty Mj&ouml;llnir. Firstborn son of Odin the All-Father, Thor is brash and arrogant and is about as frontline a warrior as one can get. When his act of sheer foolhardiness reignites the war between the Asgardians and the frost giants of Jotunheim, an angered Odin banishes his favorite son to Midgard below (but we call it Earth). This is all actually bits of flashback. The present story begins with astrophysicist (no, not a nurse) Jane Foster studying wormhole phenomena in the desert outskirts of Puente Antiguo, a sleepy New Mexico town. As Jane Foster eventually learns, the wormhole phenomenon is a mystical gateway thru which a disgraced and now mortal thunder god is sent hurtling.

The segue paragraph: DC Comics has got its work cut out, trying to match the quality of these Marvel flicks. I was in the theater, eying the comic book-related movie trailers. I was very intrigued with CAPTAIN AMERICA, somewhat interested in COWBOYS & ALIENS (which is from neither Marvel or DC), and a bit put off with GREEN LANTERN (can't Hal Jordan be more imaginative than calling up swords and big laser guns with his all-powerful ring?). I was initially concerned about THOR, and how he'll be translated to the big screen, but word's been good from its overseas release, and, it turns out, this is a really entertaining picture. Director Kenneth Branagh historically does well when you toss him a few Shakespearean bones.

Thor simply begs for elements of grandeur, of spectacular derring-do, big myth, and those Shakespearean touches. Branagh peppers in themes of dysfunction in the royal family, bitter sibling rivalry, treachery, loss and redemption. As a weary and broken-hearted Odin collapses into the Odinsleep (in which he replenishes his strength), Thor's younger brother seizes the opportunity to claim the throne. Except in his own twisty way, this is only one step into worming his way into his father's heart. Or that's what I got out of it. Loki, god of mischief and of exceedingly big-horned helmets, is a complicated backstabbing guy.

Complementing the grandiose spectacle of Asgard and the wintry barrenness of Jotunheim, Thor's time in New Mexico provides some grounding, some toning-down relief. I was pleasantly surprised that Branagh was able to interject moments of humor, and these moments are found in Thor's interactions with the humans. Thor himself has been reduced to a mere mortal state, even though he retains that godly physique and he never does lose that sense of self-belief. Shortly after Thor's plummet (and getting smacked around by Jane Foster's ride), the New Mexico desert is rocked by another wormhole phenomenon, this time heralding the arrival of the enchanted hammer Mj&ouml;llnir. Lodged in a large piece of rock, Mj&ouml;llnir is unmoveable, even though many men would try to extract it (even a cameo-ing Stan Lee is not worthy enough). Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. locks down the place, erects a camp around it, and there goes that carnival atmosphere.

Old hands like Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgrd, Rene Russo, and the always reliable Anthony Hopkins are featured, but the movie rightfully belongs to lesser-known actors like Tom Hiddleston, Jamie Andrews, and Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth, especially, anchors the film. He has a presence that extends beyond the sculpted muscles. His boastful thunder god is likable, and he does well in those quieter, redemptive moments. The guy has charisma. I think it's the beard. I wish I had a beard.

Hiddleston lends a brooding complexity to the the scheming Loki. The stunning Jamie Andrews, for my money, outshines Natalie Portman, although, admittedly, Andrews has the more showy role. Andrews convincingly plays the lady warrior Sif, and I only wish she'd had more chances to show off her fighting skills. Meanwhile, each time Portman lavished Hemsworth with one of those adoring looks, the theater audience snickered. That may be the one overriding issue I have with this film. Natalie Portman doesn't make Jane Foster someone so special that it would motivate a prideful Thor to become a gentler, kinder thunder god worthy of wielding Mj&ouml;llnir. Meanwhile, Idris Elba is fantastic as the impressive Heimdall, eagle-eyed guardian of the Bifrost Bridge. Heimdall rapidly becomes one of my favorite characters. As a sheer treat for me, personally, Kat Dennings (from the fabulous NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST) has a snarky supporting part as Jane Foster's colleague.

So Marvel's streak continues, of putting out really watchable film products, and we're only about a year away now from the Avengers movie. Thor makes for a majestic hero, and I'm almost loathe to label him a superhero because that seems to strip away some of that regal aura. There are moments of sheer awesomeness in which Thor demonstrates just how powerful he is. This is a guy who routinely goes toe to toe against giant monsters. I will say that the Destroyer construct (and its disintegrator beam) is damn impressive, and the special effects crew really did a bang-up job on it, and overall, really. For longtime comic book readers, THOR presents a series of Easter eggs, among which are references to the Hulk and Tony Stark and a tantalizing glimpse of Hawkeye.

*** SPOILER ALERT *** Regarding the post-closing credits scene, I'm not sure that a SPOILER is even warranted, because I'm not sure a lot of folks will know what they'll be looking at. But, as usual, stick around for the post-closing credits sequence. It features Nick Fury, Dr. Selvig and an unseen Loki gazing at an object of limitless power. But if, like most in the movie theater, you ended up asking, ""Okay, what the hell is that all about?"" What it is, yo, is the cosmic cube.",1304726400,6,6346,5.037142857142857
4573993,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Natalie Portman starts out the film as an astrophysicist in the New Mexico desert. There appears to be some kind of UFO crash, as apparently aliens have the ability to fly all over the planet without crashing, except New Mexico. The movie then flashes back to 985 AD in a heavily CG background as Asgard, led by Odin, aka Anthony Hopkins, is fighting the frost giants, who look like blue skinned versions of Freddie Kruger. They end up with a truce. During the coronation ceremony of Thor, a frost giant enters the realm of Asgard and disrupts the ceremony (why this was done at the time was a mystery). Thor in his passion leads a group of warriors to the planet of the frost giants to teach them a lesson. The simple touch of a frost giant freezes the skin like liquid nitrogen. This was great in 2D, I can only imagine what the CG graphics was like in 3D.

Odin is upset with Thor and takes his hammer and powers. He banishes Thor who speeds to earth only to crash into Natalie Portman and company in the desert (beginning scene). A bad hammer pun and a taser later, Thor is on his way to medical. The hammer lands elsewhere in the desert and is lodged like the Sword in the Stone. A group of yokels gather to have a cook out and attempt to remove said hammer...until the FEDS show up.

The film moves back and forth between events on earth and in Asgard, as Loki has assumed the throne of his ailing father. In order to convince the audience this is the real Thor, he speaks a Middle Earth style of English, making over frequent use of the word ""realm."" It works well as it allows him to flirt with Natalie Portman, who he thinks is the most clever person on the planet. (Isn't this one of the seven signs?) Perhaps the movie's biggest fault is that is attempts to link mythology, science fiction and science fact is such a way a 9 year old might buy it.

Like good trekkies, Thor's friends come to earth to rescue him, because the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many. They show up and are as conspicuous as Vikings in a credit card commercial. Memorable line: Stop! You are using unregistered weapons technology!""

For me the story wasn't light enough. There were a few comic lines attempted to break up the seriousness of the film, but it needed more of them. I was hoping for something along the lines of Iron Man 1. Perhaps the worst I have seen Ms. Portman in a while was her parsed OMG line. Other than that one bad line, she was great.

No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. Safe for the kiddies. They should love it.",1304726400,6,2534,4.315126050420168
4573994,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Superhero films are pretty much guaranteed to make a killing at the box office. It's mostly due to high anticipation, but also due to the fact that most studios seem to have been able to iron out the kinks over the years which lead to most of these films doing their source material justice while also just being great films in general. It hasn't always been that way though. Elektra and Punisher: War Zone practically bombed while films like X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine resulted in more fans distancing themselves from the franchise rather than embracing it. With Marvel banking so much on The Avengers being not only a huge accumulation of characters that fans love but also an amazing assembly of talent, Thor is a film that pretty much had to be good to gain momentum for what was just over the horizon. Before I gave up being a full-time comic book nerd, I never really thought much of Thor. So I wasn't really sure what to expect going into this. I wasn't overly excited for the film even though it looked fairly incredible, but luckily Thor was able to offer a magnificent spectacle that all superhero films should strive to be.

Thor still has that same atmosphere that any of the Marvel films since Iron Man have had, but at the same time seems to offer something that those films couldn't. A lot of it probably has to do with Asgard. This heavenly realm is unlike anything you've ever seen before and the special effects in the film are done well enough to be equally as impressive as Pandora in Avatar. Asgard is this spectacular kingdom in the sky that is incredibly extravagant and painted with gold. It's just breathtaking how well Thor was able to pull something like that off.

The cast is really phenomenal, as well. Chris Hemsworth is a really solid choice for Thor. His height, his build, the way he carries himself, along with his facial expressions are just as vital to how Thor is portrayed as his appearance and his dialogue. Hemsworth nails it; all of it. Tom Hiddleston was also a scene stealer. Loki is a guy you know is up to no good right from the start, but Hiddleston portrays his underhanded deeds to perfection. Throw in the intensity he utilizes in the second half of the film and Loki turns out to be a villain you're going to crave to see more of. Anthony Hopkins deserves a mention, as well. Many of Hopkins' recent roles have been lacking that special something that made many of his most popular roles so great. He was a fantastic choice for Odin though. He reminds you why you considered him so talented in the first place. The only nitpick I have is that both Natalie Portman and Tadanobu Asano were a little disappointing and I was expecting more from them. Portman doesn't really do much besides look pretty and Tadanobu's Hogun just deserved a little more screen time. I'm a huge fan of just about every Tadanobu Asano film out there though, so that could just be the fanboy in me talking.

Thor may be the loudest film I've ever seen in theaters. The film is mostly action to begin with, so it's guaranteed to be loud. But it just seemed louder than usual, especially any scene involving The Destroyer.  That's not a bad thing; not at all. I'd rather have a film be too loud than too quiet any day.

Thor is an extravagant looking film dripping with spellbinding special effects, a fantastic cast overflowing with talent, and a captivating story that holds your interest from beginning to end. Thor has enough character development to introduce new characters while also leaving enough room to expand on their origins in the forthcoming sequels you'll be itching for by the time you see Thor swing Mjolnir for the last time. The superhero spectacular also offers a fair amount of heart amongst its waves of depth while also delivering incredibly loud and explosive action sequences. Words almost don't seem to do the film justice. Thor is imaginative, charming, and the definition of what an introductory superhero film should be. It could arguably be the best Marvel film to date.",1304726400,23,4048,4.648044692737431
4573995,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I just got back from seeing this movie in 3-D and I cannot recommend it enough! The visuals, acting, (especially Hopkins,) cinematography, writing...just about EVERYTHING, about this movie is perfect! Loki is done beautifully by Hiddleston, Hemsworth is a truly worthy Thor and good old, reliable Anthony Hopkins RULES the screen whenever he is en scene as Odin, king of the Norse pantheon. His handling of Thor when he is castigated for his arrogance, (which Hemsworth brings off well,) is a study on how to handle a headstrong, powerful son....STRONGLY!! Tom Hiddleston's Loki seems like a rather meek, reticent little mouse in the beginning of the film, but by the time the end credits roll, he's become the Machiavellian putz everybody knows and loves/hates.

My boy, J. Michael Stracszynski, is responsible for the storyline, and that could explain the great visuals, which are some of the best I've seen since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", (and that's no small praise from me, considering how high ""2001"" is on my fave list!)  This is the man responsible for the exceptional Star Trek rival ""Babylon 5"" that proved itself better than its competition back in the 90s, and it shows in the high quality of the movie. Another factor has to be the presence of Shakespearean light Kenneth Branagh as director. The comic book ""Thor"" always WAS Shakespearean in feel, especially when its stories were set in Asgard, all through the 70s, so the connection is a good one

Anywho, coupled with the decent acting, (Natalie Portman is a cipher, however, in her role... it really could have been played by just about anyone!) and decent special effects (the 3-D effects are particularly well done!), I predict this will be THE blockbuster of 2011! Oh, and check out the 3-D effect used on the Hubble photos at the end credits.... WOW!!!!

Just watch, and enjoy....",1304640000,5,1851,4.923076923076923
4573996,4,B0055EAJ7A,This is no batman or superman or ironman but their is a lot of things to like about thor. this film starts out with thor being cast out of his home asgard and winds up on earth. i will not give away to much of the plot but one must keep in mind that thor is done by the sane team that brought ironman to the screen and it is clear that they use the ironman formula in this movie. It works to some degree but fails at other points. If you do not expect a huge epic master piece then thor is a great movie. don't miss it.,1304640000,,519,3.770642201834862
4573997,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I will not go into the mistakes the movie has with the Marvel Universe's take on the history of Thor; suffice to say, the details that are overlooked are minor in the grand scheme of this movie. The plot is very exciting, with action, political intrigue, romance, and comedy. The score for the movie is strong. The graphics are mind-blowing, and I only saw it in 2D. Over all, you will enjoy this movie whether you are a comic buff or just someone looking for a good movie; it is not too action-heavy to alienate most people, but has enough to stay exciting. Most importantly, the action is not used to hide the fact that there is no plot. I definitely recommend watching the movie, whether it be tomorrow morning at the earliest possible showing or after it is on Netflix and in Redbox.",1304640000,,787,4.472222222222222
4573998,5,B0055EAJ7A,"In the remote realm of Asgard, young Thor is heir to the throne, but is arrogant with a quick temper. When Thor's misguided actions cause the end of an unsteady peace between the Asgard and Frost Giants, King Odin banishes Thor to Earth. Thor is found by scientist Jane Foster who studies the skies. Without his powers, Thor is forced to live as a mortal and learn what it means to be a true hero.

Chris Hemsworth takes on the iconic role of Thor, the god of thunder. Hemsworth not only looks the part of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Nordic god, but he plays the part of haughty, spoiled young prince to perfection. Unlike most other superhero origin stories, Thor doesn't go through much physical change. Instead, he grows as a man and a champion for others, learning humility and self-sacrifice.

They couldn't have found a better actor to play Odin. Anthony Hopkins shines in whatever he does, and as Asgard's wise and benevolent leader is no exception. And Thor's malicious and manipulative brother Loki is played by Tom Hiddleston to creepy perfection. Natalie Portman costars as Jane Foster, Thor's human love interest. I was skeptical at first, but the two did have great chemistry. And Jane's small team of scientists including Stellan Skarsgard and Dr. Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy added a fun dynamic of humor and simplicity. Whereas, Thor's friends from Asgard are a bit cartoonish and over-the-top.

The main story takes place on both present day Earth and on Asgard, moving at a steady pace. At 1 hour 54 minutes long, I expected there to be some slower scenes or the story to be drawn out. Instead, it felt like the movie flew by, and it was suddenly over too soon. The action scenes were intense, with incredible special effects. The drama was balanced well with humor. Full of mystery, suspense, adventure, and a bit of romance - I loved every minute of Thor. Comic book and superhero fans of all ages will enjoy this cosmic adventure. I saw this sneak preview on a regular screen, but in 3-D. I highly recommend the 3-D experience, with the fantastic special effects; it really pulls viewers into the action scenes. Though, I do wish there were a more comfortable option than those annoying plastic 3-D glasses. I'll definitely be seeing this one again in the theaters, most likely on IMAX next time.

And like other Marvel comic book films, don't forget to stay through the credits to see the extra clip!",1304553600,7,2427,4.7440758293838865
4573999,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Was fortunate enough to see this in Asia in a reclining seat ...

This movie was a lot of fun. The actors acquitted themselves wonderfully, although Natalie Portman's part could have been played by most anybody. The lead was charismatic and humorous as the brash Thor, who has a lot to learn about being the next King of Asgard. Hopkins is inimitable and fierce as Odin, and Loki is well-cast and well-played, the brooding competitor to the throne.

Ultimately it is a story about fathers and sons, and the tragic ways in which we may choose to gain their approval, which makes for some surprises. Although most of the plot is telegraphed, it is nevertheless touching, and you will find yourself rooting for reconciliation. It is a joy to behold the script, the acting, and the SFX. Asgard is a sight to see, and the clash between the mortal Thor and his new habitation in New Mexico makes for some great gags. ""I like this drink. Bring me another!"" and his brief quest for a steed are sure to bring some chuckles.

The Frost Giants are so-so as far as FX, but there are plenty of thundering scenes, with or without Mjolnir. You will see the four friends face off with the Destroyer and a pretty multicultural Asgard, among other things. The setting is not quite as epic as expected, being set in a smallish town, but of course the stakes are high nevertheless.

Doyle's score is suitably rousing and grand, although the main theme - that is, the sequence of primary notes of the theme -  is unremarkable, at least on first hearing, unlike his memorable ""Henry V.""

Good performance by the cast, mild humor and that was good. I didn't like the silly humor in Iron Man 2. Stan Lee is there, and there's a very cool unexpected cameo by a fellow avenger.

I'm not a Thor fan, but I do know something about the comic. This was a very well made adaptation. The movie made it here April 28th so I had to go see it. The battles are awesome, the relation between Odin and Thor was well depicted. I really think they really cared about this project.

If you have the chance watch it in 3D. Thor was awesome, let's see how Capatain America turns out. I couldn't see the scene after the credits, they stopped when the credits were rolling. There's a cool song during the credits. The scene is already in youtube...it's no big deal.

Clark Gregg is good, but his part is small.

This film introduces Hawkeye.  Hawkeye is a dumb character.  Jeremy Renner does better with him later.

I do like Thor's arc here, learning humility, becoming his worthy self.  But it's just not executed very well.

Tom Hiddleston is great.  This is the first Marvel movie with a decent villain, and would be the only one for awhile, but Loki is not given enough oxygen in this movie to burn as bright as he does later.  And he is not enough to save the movie.

4574037,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I'm not sure why this movie gets so much hate from critics. Is it a masterpiece? No. It is a fun movie with some cool visuals that was an important building block for the rest of the MCU? Yes. Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have no chemistry and the forced romance is the worst thing about this movie. But I think Hemsworth and Hiddleston both gave very solid performances in this movie and are entertaining to watch. The frost giants were visually interesting, if not very complex villains, and Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Odin. While the most recent Thor movie is a much better film, I still enjoy this movie a lot and appreciate it for creating the characters we know and love today.",1525219200,,695,4.568

4574068,2,B0055EAJ7A,"So disappointed with this movie.  Here is my disclaimer - I don't read comic books, so I have nothing to base this on other than a faraway reading of the Edda.  I have enjoyed the other Marvel movies that I've seen (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America, Ant Man), but this one fell flat.  I have loved Natalie Portman ever since I saw her in Luc Besson's ""The Professional"".  However, just as with the Star Wars prequels (particularly the second one), she has proven that she needs an outstanding director in order to turn in a good performance.  Her character was a supposedly brilliant physicist who was also gorgeous and good. Barf.  Her character was just there as a romantic interest with very little to do otherwise.  Same for Rene Russo.  I expect better of these ladies. I expect them to demand that a love interest do more than just moon about and contribute nothing except random motivation for scattered and not-well-thought-out plot points.  As for Hemsworth, I didn't think he was particularly bad or particularly good. A very meh leading man with good abs.  The only character with any type of dimension was Loki.  The effects were good and the other members of my household enjoyed it, so I gave it one more star than I otherwise would have done.  Besides that, it was a very bland movie with lazy scriptwriting, uneven acting and directing, and good special effects.  The only part I truly enjoyed was Stan Lee's cameo as the pickup truck driver. I hope the next Marvel movie we watch redeems this franchise.",1524441600,,1525,4.666666666666667

Having said that, Marvel's Thor (and indeed much of Asgard) bears almost no resemblance to any of the actual Norse lore material. That kinda bugged me since they could have been more faithful to it and not changed the story much. Well, aside from Thor being married to Sif, that would have complicated things with Natalie Portman's character. Oh, and why the hell was a Celtic triskel on mjolnir? Some graphics guy just thought it looked cool?

Overall the story was complete, there were no loose ends and the acting good all around. I was expecting a Captain America cameo but instead we got Hawkeye, but that's OK since Cap would have taken too long to set up. The various relationships were well done. And I'm so glad they had Loki be able to stand up and fight on his own. Even Frigg got to kick a little ass. They also added some subtle and creative bits for Thor's divine abilities so he wasn't a one-trick smashing pony. His ""hero's journey"" was necessarily compact but it served a point and have the character some depth.",1522022400,,1156,4.5311004784688995

4574129,4,B0055EAJ7A,"My daughter is in 1st grade and has been getting into superhero movies.  It started with Wonder Woman (a DC flick) and then somehow she saw Spiderman: Homecoming, I don't remember the details that led to that.  But if she's going to get into the MCU, she needs to watch them in order to get all the background and context.

Leading up to the Avengers, we needed to see Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  We also did Iron Man 2 as that came before the Avengers but we skipped the Hulk since it had another actor and didn't have an origin story, didn't really contribute like the others did.

I originally saw this first Thor movie with my wife in the theater in 3D.  Wasn't too impressed with it.  But I had always wondered how Thor would translate from comic books to the big screen, seemed an awkward fit.  But it worked, and my daughter took to it well.  I think the scene where Chris Hemsworth is running around with his shirt off clinched the deal for her...

From a ""family friendly"" perspective, it's a little annoying that all these movies (not just MCU) feel the need to slip in one or two profanities just to cement a PG-13 rating.  I mean, I'm not profanity-adverse but I'm not in a hurry to expose a 6 year old to that language yet (not to mention her 3 year old sister watches them with her).  So far, though, they don't seem to have made an impression - I did tell her ""if you hear any grownup language, just ignore it"", for whatever that was worth...

4574137,5,B0055EAJ7A,"The first of Thor trilogy introduces us not only to The God of Thunder but the actor who takes this role and makes it his own. Chris Hemsworth is fantastic as the egotistical, arrogant and upstart son of Odin. He is a hero to be praised, leading the armies of Asgard to victory. His accolades are many and he struts as only the hero and victor of a much beloved people can. But his arrogance is his undoing as he argues with Odin, wanting and demanding something be done about the Frost Giants, their eternal enemies, There is an uneasy peace and Thor wants to take them down. He is the God of Thunder but Odin is the King and  he show his displeasure at his rebelious son's arrogance by removing his most prized possession, Mjolner, the hammer, stripping him of his powers and vanquishing him to Earth.
There he meets Jane Porter who while impressed by him manages to put him in his place. Meanwhile Loki, his brother is attemptig to mitigate the damage but he too is learning that there is more to him than he has been told. Confronting Odin he realizes the fragilty of his father, as the King Collapses. Lokie now is a position to take the throne, his anger at the circumstances of his birth at the forefront. He is intentent of making sure Thor never returns home. The final battle is one that takes us to the next installment of the Trilogy and also sends Loki on the path to the next Marvel movie, The Avengers.  Tom Hiddleston is fantastic as Loki making it just as much his character as Hemsworth made Thor his. The effects are fantastic and Idris Elba is also great in his role as Hemdal.

Absolutely no depth at all. Motivation hinted at, not really developed. At least no gratuitous sex scenes and Natalie Portman remains completely clothed throughout the movie! I couldn't tell if it was meant to be funny, or thrilling. I think Thor's resemblance to Jack Black caused that confusion. Lots of color. Clearly there is carry-over to other movies. For instance, S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't explained. I guess the folks who read the comic books know more about it.

Anyway, entertaining, pleasant, not a total waste of money.",1509840000,,689,5.035087719298246

4574190,3,B0055EAJ7A,"To me personally, this movie is great because of tom hiddleston's performance. I loved the way he portrayed the character of loki, the genuine tears that are shed.
Literally almost everything else is meh. Chris's acting as thor is good, I hated natalie portman's character. She was boring, she felt like a burden, and she didn't feel at all genuine. All the ""human"" characters are meh. None of them are very interesting to me, the acting isn't anything astounding. The final fight was kinda bad, loki just sorta cried some and then thor got frustrated and after that loki intentionally throws himself off rainbow bridge.
This movie is good cuz of Loki's character to me, thats the main reason I would recommend this film. Everything else besides chris's acting is pretty passable, but still a bit bland. 6/10.",1508025600,,809,4.869565217391305

4574244,2,B0055EAJ7A,"I can't speak to the quality of the Blu-ray, however the movie is easily the worst Marvel film I've seen. I like Thor, and went in without bias, not the script is terrible - the lame joke about Thor being hammered, for instance. The acting and plot are sub-par, and things just seemed ridiculous, even for a movie about viking gods. Luckily, the character gets better treatment elsewhere, but this movie is awful, and I felt insulted watching it, since I certainly didn't feel respected as a  viewer, and I can't fathom why it's rated so highly.

Last note: I don't hate action movies or superhero movies, or Thor! I like all those things, provided they don't forget the viewer has a brain. Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, the Avengers, all of these do a great job. This one, though, felt more like typical action fare - something the likes of Michael Bay would churn out. Obviously, there's a market for that, but it's not me. And, if it's not you, either, maybe consider skipping this one.",1494892800,,994,4.610169491525424

4574290,4,B0055EAJ7A,"With Kenneth Branagh directing, and a score by Patrick Doyle (who did the score for Branagh's ""Henry V"") no wonder there is a Shakespearian flavor to this Asgardian family epic, which delightfully interfaces with Earth--and resolves as an important piece of the ongoing S.H.I.E.L.D. sci-fi drama.  Chris Hemsworth holds the film's two disparate worlds together, being a prince of the realm and mighty warrior whether among Frost Giants or in the mud of New Mexico.  Whether in jeans and no shirt, or in full classical armor.  Tom Hiddleston also develops his complex character with authentic emotion--and hats off to the casting of the two young boys who portray Thor and Loki at the film's outset.  I have to mention Anthony Hopkins--he apparently thinks very highly of Branagh as a director, and indeed, this is probably my favorite Hopkins role.  To give us the Norse god Odin Allfather in flesh and blood, blindingly powerful and deeply tender by turn, the father of two gods (Thunder and Mischief) whose conflict will energize a Marvel series (indeed, intergalactic war)--this is powerful work, credible and intense.  Did I love this movie?  Need you ask?  Also note that Stellan Skarsgard sets up the character of Erik Selvig with a flawlessly subtle weakness.
There is a whole world--the vast Marvel world--to discover here.  Begun with comic book visions and resolved in wit-laced action/drama that compels attention to the series of films which follow.  Further, there are no weak women.  Natalie Portman, Rene Russo, and Jamie Alexander are each powerful in her own realm.  Finally, Idris Elba and Colm Feore give substance--flesh, blood, feeling--to two otherworldly characters whose emotions also thrust the plot forward.  Finally, patience with battle scenes (hey, i'm a little old lady) is mega-rewarded.  And even battle scenes have their choreography.  One favorite quote:  Chris Hemsworth as Thor--""I have no plans to die today.""  Idris Elba as Heimdall-- ""None do.""",1486598400,,1983,5.224683544303797

Natalie Portman was amazing and beautiful - as always - and it's nice to see the lead female role have brains and beauty.  Chris Hemsworth...seriously, do I even really need to review his acting?

Hemsworth was good as Thor and Hiddleston steals every scene he's in, somehow managing to encourage empathy for a damaged and duplicitous villain.

4574424,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was a lot of fun. The actors acquitted themselves wonderfully, although Natalie Portman's part could have been played by most anybody. The lead was charismatic and humorous as the brash Thor, who has a lot to learn about being the next King of Asgard. Hopkins is inimitable and fierce as Odin, and Loki is well-cast and well-played, the brooding competitor to the throne.

Ultimately it is a story about fathers and sons, and the tragic ways in which we may choose to gain their approval, which makes for some surprises. Although most of the plot is telegraphed, it is nevertheless touching, and you will find yourself rooting for reconciliation. It is a joy to behold the script, the acting, and the SFX. Asgard is a sight to see, and the clash between the mortal Thor and his new habitation in New Mexico makes for some great gags. ""I like this drink. Bring me another!"" and his brief quest for a steed are sure to bring some chuckles.",1469577600,,948,4.609467455621302

4574475,3,B0055EAJ7A,"The first installment of Thor was entertaining but left some to be desired. I've always liked the character Thor and his story so my expectations may have been higher for this movie than other 'super heroes' movies and would like to give this movie more stars but in reality it was a good film but not a great film. Thought the story was a bit weak although had its moments of being very good, but I also may be basing that assessment more than needed on the climatic scene in the small New Mexico town which I thought was too much like a 'back lot' movie setup and the lack of screen chemistry between the lead male (Thor) and female (Jane) characters. Acting was good with Anthony Hopkins playing Odin with the pride, strength, and zeal that the part should be played with, Rene Russo  plays her part well yet would have been nice to see her have a bit more of a role. Chris Hemsworth is a very good choice to play Thor and all-in-all did very well with the part. Actor Tom Hiddleston is excellent as Loki , who can be easily liked and disliked in the same scene. While Natalie Portman can be a very good actress she didn't fit this part great. The lack of any real chemistry between her and Chris Hemsworth and that throughout the entire movie it felt like the better 'love interest' could have been between Thor and Sif , made for the Jane part as a someone Thor really deeply cherishes to feel some what forced and not totally necessary. A few disappointments, but an entertaining film.
This set includes blu-ray 3D, blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy. Extra features include commentary by director, seven featurettes, eleven deleted scenes.",1466121600,,1642,4.5286195286195285

4574491,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Mostly a fun superhero movie, but nothing very special. I'm not familiar with comic book Thor, so maybe I missed some depth to the characters, but with the exception of Loki they all seem very one-dimensional. Thor wants glory, Natalie Portman wants Thor. The rest of them just want to advance the plot and Marvel wants you to watch Avengers. I don't even remember Portman's character's name because she had no characterization beyond being a doe-eyed human ""scientist"" (what kind of scientist? Marvel doesn't know) who falls in love with the god of thunder. Thor's interest in her is a mystery to me -- I mean, not that she's not pretty, but I'd like to think Thor would aim higher. Like, you know, someone his species.

And it wasn't just the romance subplot that was feeble, although that was the worst of it. The whole storyline is weak. There's not a lot of exposition, not much thunder-godly butt-kicking, not much intrigue, not much drama. It feels like a backstory, which I guess it is. And Thor isn't one of Marvel's biggest money-makers so perhaps his first film wasn't given the attention that could have made it great.

Long story short, it's a worthwhile movie to rent for a couple bucks, but it's not to the standard of most other MCU films. Moderate your expectations and you will probably enjoy it.",1464912000,,1314,4.708695652173913
4574492,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I am too biased as a comic series lover to trust for an unbiased rating, I just want to make that clear.

They simply could not have cast the movie any better.

The plot was very good like the great stories of old; a tale of glory, loss of glory and then redemption through great sacrifice.  Granted, far too many will ooh and aah about the special effects and the admittedly wonderful job done on the costumes but you have to look deeper into this movie to get everything else it has waiting for you.

I don't know how many times I have watched it and it will stay on my most watched list probably for as long as I have enough of a mind left to watch movies.  :-)  With my 30+ year old children/vermin slowly driving me to drink and the brink of insanity that might not be too far into the future after all.  :-)

Watch it and enjoy.  Anthony Hopkins IS Odin.",1464825600,,860,4.132530120481928

It's a plot with very little gravity and the main hero makes his grand transformation in a completely implausible and insincere way. There is no heroic journey here; there's only a bunch of random events and conversations that apparently result in a massive personal heroic shift. Completely boring, but otherwise unoffensive.",1459209600,,427,5.294117647058823

4574577,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I was incredibly disappointed, the movie was... Awful.

The characters themselves are amazing! The action is great, filmography beautiful...

But it is severely lacking in many areas, especially the writing. It has a terrible plot, way too much time spent on earth (this I hear, is a complaint many fans have - the Earth scenes seem to be incredibly unpopular), too many plot holes and things that make no sense whatsoever.

Unless you're a hardcore Marvel fan or Thor fan (sadly, I admit to being such a Thor fan), this movie probably isn't for you. Also, if you've read the comics, know that this movie fails in that regard.

If you're hoping for anything mythology related, haha - yeah... It's going to be even more disappointing.

Watch it for the characters, the acting, pretty scenes... But don't expect a good story.",1458432000,,823,4.808510638297872

The cast is great and the actors are also good considering the poor script they had to work with.  Other than the story being simple-minded, it was enjoyable.  Specifically,  the characters were two-dimensional at best and not credible.  There was a professor who seemed be lost and followed his cute young graduate student (Natalie Portman) everywhere she went.  There was the ""bad people"", who just sat on their planet waiting around to be bad when the opportunity arose.  There was the ""beautiful man"" who went from 100% ego to humble leader in a single life lesson.  And, of course, his plucky entourage who barely had parts.  And, of course, the good king (like Jor-el) played by Anthony Hopkins.  He must have wanted a challenge, but not even a man of his amazing talent could rescue this trifle of a movie.",1446854400,,978,4.796407185628743
4574692,4,B0055EAJ7A,"A superhero movie directed by Kenneth Branagh?  Yes!  It works on many levels because the story of Thor, his father Odin and ""brother"" Loki is Shakespearian in its scope.  Breathtaking action balanced with rollicking adventure and quiet moments all propel the story along.  Great performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston cement this as a thrill-ride on a cosmic scale.  Some of the special effects look a bit cartoonish, but it's easy to forgive when you've got a good story to tell.  Be on the lookout for cameos by JMS and Walter Simonson (and, of course, Stan the Man!).",1446681600,,575,4.876288659793815

4574694,5,B0055EAJ7A,"From the dramatic, colorful 2D pictures in comic books, The Mighty Thor transformed into the action packed Marvel film, Thor, and captured the interest of many in its 2011 release. The director Kenneth Branagh developed an action/adventure movie with a comical and romantic dynamic that created another classic superhero among the well known Superman and Batman. Thor tells the story of a young son about to inherit the throne from his father, the King of Asgard. However, after disputes and irresponsible acts against the Frost Giants, the king considers Thor unfit for the throne and banishes him to Earth stripped of his powers. Thors mighty hammer housing his powers is sent to Earth buried in the ground only to be retrieved if Thor rightfully earns it back in the eyes of his father. While Thors brother remains in Asgard abusing his new power, Thor must fight to find his way back to his powers and Asgard to protect his people from his brothers dangerous ruling. From battle scenes to romance Kenneth Brangah creates a story line showing the development of proper leadership by crafty filmmaking.
The film opens with a scene of a female scientist, Jane, driving into a storm. Suddenly her car hits a man whom which the audience does not yet recognize as Thor in human form. The camera in this instance takes a subjective focalization perspective so that the audience sees through the eyes of Thor while he looks up at Jane.  Using this view shows that at this point in the film Thor has selfish ways as he only has the capability to think for himself and not others around him. The dark storm skies already suggest to the audience that there is an issue that needs resolved. Clearly from the start Thor was not fit for his leadership position so the film opens in chaos to demonstrate the complications with his situation. This first introduction to Jane also is accompanied by bright lighting shed behind Jane so that Thor may only see her and nothing else in the background. This type of lighting foreshadows Janes important role in Thors development throughout the movie and sets the stage for the romance aspect of the film that assists Thor in becoming a better person and leader.
The film then tracks back in time to introduce the audience to Thors life in Asgard before his banishment to Earth. During this time Thor decides to visit the Frost Giants. Low camera angling is used to prove Thors lack of leadership skill when he visits Jotunheim. As the angle takes Thors perspective looking up on the Frost King the audience gets the feeling that his skills even fall below the evil leader. After his childish acts of violence against the Frost Giants the director uses high angle shots from behind the King looking down upon Thor. This type of angling further proves Thors incapability and immaturity to rule like his father can. Thors hammer is also sent down to Earth as well. Throughout the film the camera focuses on the hammer that remains stuck in the Earth. The hammer is always introduced at a high angle with it centrally focalized in the middle of the crater it created.  The director choses this shot to serve as a reminder to the audience of the central motive of the movie, rising to the challenge and development as a leader.
When on Earth Thors main objective is to be able to retrieve his hammer that is stuck in the ground.  He immediately searches for the hammers location and goes on his journey with Jane to gain his powers back. When Thor decides to go to retrieve his hammer before he has earned it, the scenes take place in the darkness of night again.  The fact that the lighting has not changed since the beginning of the movie shows that Thor has not overcome his challenge and thus indicates he would fail.
During the film a battle unfolds on Earth allowing for the direct to add in more filmmaking techniques.  This battle however is different from the previous battles in the movie. The battle takes place in broad daylight, a very atypical scenario.  In most films battles take place in darkness but the light used in this situation indicates to the audience Thor reaching expectations thus fulfilling one of the conflicts in the film.  And Thor does reach these expectations as he unselfishly helps innocent civilians to safety and then ultimately surrenders himself for the sake of the lives of others. Lying dead on the ground the camera takes a more objective view while Jane looks down on Thors body in disbelief. The objective view capturing himself, Jane, the other friends, and the environment shows Thors newfound ability to think beyond himself proving to be a true quality of a leader. With his powers back and hammer in hand Thor fights his way back to Asgard to overrule is own brother. Thor successfully restores peace to his kingdom by the end of the film, and when Thor has discussions with his father the camera then uses eye level angles.  Putting Thor at eye level with the king indicates to the audience that Thor has grown into a qualified leader such as his father.
Like any director, Kenneth Branagh aims to entertain an audience with an action packed superhero film full of superpowers, battles, love, and comedy.  Branaghs career before Thor consisted of overseeing and staring in many Shakespeare films such as Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing. These Shakespeare films did not embody the special effects and film techniques like Thor. The message behind true leadership does not stand out immediately to the audience as they are distracted by all the other mini plots and special effects that Branagh utilized.  Taking into account this distraction Branagh creatively uses varying ranges of lighting, focalization, and camera shots to get the audience to unknowingly and naturally follow the development of leadership through the main character, Thor.",1446595200,,5823,4.814

Thor's character matures a lot, while we see the events that help alienate Loki from his family. My least favorite thing about the story is how Thor and his parents continuously take Loki's allegiance for granted and seem oblivious to the fact that he has feelings. It makes Thor and his parents come across as rather uncaring. The conflict between the family members does help ground this mix of mythology and super hero comic in real life.

4574769,1,B0055EAJ7A,The case of the discs came smashed. The DVD side of the plastic case was almost cracked in half with the paper cover torn apart and the DVD disc was just rolling around inside the broken case. I haven't checked yet but I am not even sure if the DVD will work since it has numerous scratches from the broken pieces of the case. Love the movie but definitely not happy with the way it's arrived.,1440806400,35,393,4.184210526315789
4574770,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Great Film. Accidentally bought the low res version instead of the high res and only the surround sound can be heard through the speakers.
It says 5.1 sounds but even when I play it through my receiver it only shows that it is receiving two channels of sound. Dialog is almost inaudible and you have crank up the sound to hear anything; which is deafening on explosions and loud effects. No issues with other movies or net**** on my TV. Only this movie, which stinks, because it is great movie.",1440720000,,494,4.5
4574771,5,B0055EAJ7A,I really enjoyed this movie--way more than I thought I would.  This is a close second to Captain America: the First Avenger in the list of the Avengers series.  Great story and awesome directing (love Kenneth Branaugh!). I have been waiting for the bluray to come down in price but got impatient so I purchased the amazon digital version to hold me for now.  I do kind of wish I would have spent the extra for the HD version.,1440633600,,425,4.3544303797468356

First of all, anything involving Kenneth Branagh is bound to be well done.  But more than that, the actors in this film, particularly Chris Hemsworth, can truly ACT!--beautifully!  The story blends action and adventure with romance and pathos, family issues, ...  Thor is a god and a superhero, but he's also vulnerable and sensitive.  And I love the mixture of ancient and modern societies coming together and the humor that grows from that mix.

Portman plays much stronger character  as Princess Amidala in  the Star Wars movies.. do not know why she did not insist that her character  not be stronger in Thor.  Found this movie sensationalistic with little development, although ostensibly Thor is changed and becomes worthy through his love for Hope and his willingness to sacrifice for humanity.",1438300800,,541,5.033707865168539

The handsome but arrogant and inexperienced son THOR, 'thinks' that he is ready to rule the people and kingdom of Asgard. But, his father, played by distinguished Actor Anthony Hopkins, is displeased at THOR's fool hardy, impulsiveness and he banishes THOR to the planet Earth, to learn a lesson or two, in humility and true leadership. While there, THOR must battle to reclaim the title of 'God of Thunder' and his legal and biological birthright as heir to the throne, as well as his sacrificial (for the good of the whole), leadership skills. And, just how does he accomplish this without his superior strength and powerful hammer, that aids him in fighting evil? Will he let his powers and allotted inheritance go, for the love of an earthly woman? Will he truly forsake all..., as regarding the good citizens of Asgard, so that he can remain on Earth while chaos, mayhem and evil, ascend on the otherwise, peaceful kingdom of Asgard? An action, adventure, super hero, big screen depiction which is sure to thrill, any audience. On a single, color, DVD disc, starring handsome Actor Chris Hemsworth in the title role, this super hero depiction is sure to please. Nina Kish",1437004800,,1348,4.83982683982684

4574904,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I know very little about comic books and superheroes.  Case in point?  I didn't know that Thor was a superhero until they started making this movie.  All I really knew about him was that he was a Norse god.  So I went into this movie pretty much a blank slate, but I enjoyed it.

Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a prince in the land of Asgard.  While his wise father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) tries to train him to be a wise ruler, Thor just wants the adventure and glory of battle.

And so Thor is sent to Earth and made human.  His path crosses that of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an astrophysicist who thinks he is the answer to her research.

Meanwhile, back at home, Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is trying to take over the throne.  Will Thor learn the lesson he needs to regain his power?  Will there be a way to defeat Loki?

So, not being familiar with the character, I really had no idea what to expect from the movie.  I often found myself a plot point ahead of the action, but that was about all.  Most of the time, I was caught up in the story and just enjoying the ride.  While I don't know the Marvel universe all that well, I did catch some references to Iron Man, which made me smile.

I was surprised at how much humor there was in the movie.  No, it isn't a comedy, but a few of the scenes and plenty of lines were funny.  Since I saw it on a Tuesday night, the theater wasn't packed, but there were spots where all of us were laughing.

But when it comes time for the action, the movie really delivers.  Thor gets several fight scenes, most of which are well done.  The first one is a little hard to follow, but I didn't have any trouble with the others.

Likewise the effects are mostly good.  Most of the time I bought what I was seeing on the screen, but one race of characters we meet seems a little fake sometimes when they are on the screen.

The acting, on the other hand, is uniformly good.  Honestly, I didn't recognize anyone in the cast until I saw their names at the end, so I wasn't distracted by thinking of past credits.  The actors pulled me into the story and made me really care about their characters and the outcome of the story.

I saw the movie in the 2D format.  Frankly, I don't see the need for 3D on this film.  It was perfectly fine visually this way, so don't spend the extra money on 3D.

And yes, you'll want to stay through the credits for one last scene.

Superhero movies are meant to be fun and entertaining, and Thor succeeds in that regard.  Sit back and enjoy a fun story for a couple of hours.",1432166400,,2551,4.195876288659794

4574975,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Long ago Odin (Anthony Hopkins) led Asgard to victory against the Jotunheim Frost Giants and captured the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Warriors. Over a thousand years later, Odin is about to crown his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), as King of Asgard, but the coronation ceremony is interrupted when the Front Giants find a way into the weapons vault and try to steal back the Casket. Fortunately, it wasn't stolen as the giants fell before they could take it. Wanting to make an example of them, Thor and some of his loyal companions travel to Jotunheim against his fathers wishes and start a war with the giants. Odin rescues them but not without grave consequences: upon returning to Asgard, Thor is banished to Earth for his actions, powerless and alone. Only his hammer, Mjolnir, is sent with him, but now with an enchantment that only the worthy can wield itand Thor is not.

On Earth, Thor meets Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an astrophysicist who was there along with her mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig, the night Thor came through the wormhole.

Meanwhile, Thors brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), finds out that his own heritage is not what he was told and, upon finding out his true origin, seeks to ensure his brother never returns to Asgard so he could become the king instead.

While on Earth, Thor must learn what it means to be humble, care for others, and thus earn his place as the proper king of Asgard, all in time to stop his brother from leading the Frost Giants into Asgard and destroying Odins kingdom.

This flick was Marvels fourth film in its Phase One plan leading up to The Avengers.

I love this movie. Its down-to-earth, fun, has a good story and enough action to keep things exciting but not so much that it bogs down the entire movie.

Up until this flick, Thor was basically an unknown character to the movie-going public, and Thor does its job on giving the character a rich history, making you care about him, and making you cheer him on on his path to redemption.

The scenes on Asgard were breathtakingheavenly, eventhe size and scope of the city enough to inspire awe. The stuff on Earth, well, its just the stuff on Earth and this is the first Ive personally seen the realms of fantasy and reality merge so well. There was a bit of that in the Harry Potter movies, but those kids never went to another world where its fantasy-type stuff 24/7.

The special effects were awesome and, to me, were a kind of unintentional preview to an exciting live action Superman movie, with Thor being the one in the red cape this time. The flying sequences were powerful, the strength, the lightning blastsall good stuff, and with The Avengers on the horizon, the climatic fight scene between Thor and the Destroyer was well-paced and well done, saving Thors best for the ensemble film to come a year later.

The relationship between Thor and Loki was done especially well because most siblings feel that their parents favor one above the other. Theres always going to be some sibling rivalry, jealousy and competitiveness. This flick nailed that, in my opinion, especially on Lokis side of things. I mean, at times you cant help but feel bad for the guy and sympathize with his motives (thats the mark of a good villain, by the way).

Thor is a sweet introduction to the character, sets him up really well for The Avengers, and this reviewer cant wait to check out Thor: The Dark World and see how the Mighty Thor grows as a hero and as Asgards king.",1429056000,,3479,4.623987034035657

 This movie has a lot going for it, including the lavish sets for Asgard, the home of the Gods.  Asgard, a city, looks like the sort of place that Ming the Merciless would build if he had no money problems.  The other thing that makes this film special must be the incredible cast.  Third and fourth level characters are played by movie stars that we know and love.  The writing, done by seven different people who have a listing in the credits and the directing by the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh (who has made the definitive modern film version of Hamlet) do not make the same level of achievement.  Writing by committee rarely leads to success.  Branagh might be out of his comfort zone with a super hero to deal with.
 Lets talk about the cast.  Chris Hemsworth, who I most recently saw as Kirks father briefly in Star Trek, plays the title role with a light touch.  In comic book movies the train can run off the track and into avid camp-mode all too easily, which Hemsworth avoids.  Natalie Portman, who I now believe can do anything well, plays an astrophysicist who understandably falls for the Norse God.  Kat Dennings provides the comic sidekick and some of the best lines as Portmans ditzy young science intern.
 The great actor Anthony Hopkins seems Godlike as Odin Allfather, the king of the Gods.  Neither he, one eyed and bearded, nor Rene Russo as Frigga (Mrs. Odin) are easily recognizable under their makeup and costumes.  Both do admirably.  A couple of my favorite actors show up in minor roles.  Ray Stevenson (the Rome TV series) and Idris Elba (The Wire TV series) also disguised by make-up and costumes, serve supporting roles as one of Thors war companions and as the immortal guardian of the gate between worlds.
 I could go on but will end with Jamie Alexander.  She plays Lady Sif, another of Thors war band and wears what could be armor by Victorias Secret.  Stan Lee, the originator of the Marvel universe, appears in a quick flash ala Alfred Hitchcock.  No movie of the twenty first century could be complete without at least a quick view of Samuel L. Jackson.  He graces the screen with a short cameo to flog more Marvel products.
 Stan Lee and the other producers went all out, spending $150 million to make this very nearly worthy film.  The public enthusiasm vindicates their confidence.  The film has taken in $242 million world-wide to date. The three saw blade, only average, movie, runs an average one hour 55 minutes.  It carries a mild PG-13 rating for plenty of violence but there are no language or nudity problems.
 The film flips back and forth between Earth and the land of the Gods.  On Earth, the main story line involves the attraction between Portman and Hemsworth and some running and hiding",1427414400,,2750,4.661122661122661

4575009,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Another great film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
What really makes this film stand out is Kenneth Branagh's hilarious sense of humor. From Erik proclaiming that Thor could be anywhere in New Mexico, only for Jane to hit him as soon as she backs up her car to Thor going into a pet shop looking for a horse. Even the incredibly serious Heimdall has some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere and hit perfectly.
The whole ""fish-out-of-water"" thing is such a cliche in movies, but Kenneth Branagh really does a great job with it and gets many laughs out of it.
It's not all comedy though. The acting is great. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston start off their careers on strong notes. The rest of the cast is great too, particularly Anthony Hopkins.
The film also benefits greatly from it's great characters and warm character development.
As a God, Thor has to be the least-relatable Avenger, so leave it to Kenneth Branagh to make him an immensely compelling character.
He's a great director and this is a great movie!",1426377600,,1025,4.7

4575011,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I had to see for myself.  It's true:  The 3D has to be the most underwhelming, underutilized I've seen in any of my collection.  Except for a very few select action scenes, it's like they forgot it was supposed to be 3D.  Until the end credits, which look incredible, as if to say ""This is what you could have had all along, sorry.""  (In fairness, I've noticed all 3D movies seem to really pull out all the stops for end credits.  Why is this?  Are they just easier?)

If you absolutely must try for yourself, I suppose you will (like I did).  But if this is the first disc you're trying out on your great new 3D setup, don't be dismayed if it doesn't impress.  There are some really great titles out there that do it right (like Avatar and Star Trek: Into Darkness.  Check out the rest of my reviews on 3D movies for more).

No, up until around the early 2000's, Thor (the comics) really didn't have a good writer. This movie is reflecting the comics and giving the characters a back-story in the most interesting way they can (which is very hard). They have to get character development in somehow and if that means a few sucky moments of Thor and Jane driving into the very fastely sinking sun...then so be it. All in all, this movie is mediocre, not as good as it's sequel, but good as far as the phase one movies go, its pretty good.",1420329600,,716,4.431818181818182

4575126,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I loved the comics and cartoons with Thor in them as a kid and Thor remains in my top 5 favorite heroes ever! I cannot give this film 5 stars though. All the CGI and super fights cannot account for the fact that Thor, in this film, was just a little too ""soft"" at times. In the comics and cartoons, Thor was ALL about beating up his enemies into a bloody mess! True, this film features the very beginnings of the Thor comic book when he was banished to Earth and stripped of his god powers but even when Thor had his powers, he just seemed to be a little ""not himself"". This Thor in this film just does not have that ""warrior spirit"" feel. Yes, he likes to fight and even disobeys Odin to do it. However, at the risk of getting some ""hate comments"" I feel that I must say that the Thor in this movie is just not as ""tough"" or ""rugged"" as in the comics and cartoons.  Excellent CGI and sets! Very good, but just not an excellent film.",1420070400,,933,4.098360655737705
4575127,4,B0055EAJ7A,"God of Thunder gets his own outing in preparation for the come-together conflagration of The Avengers. Chris Hemsworth proves himself to be a pretty okay (albeit slightly wooden) demi-god, and he gets to deliver some lofty speechifying, but regrettably nothing quite as nifty as the stilted Shakespearean dialogue from the comicbooks. So as not offend any particular religious group, we are now told that the Asgardians are not gods, but just a bunch of fun-loving super-advanced space aliens. Uhhh, okay. It's treated pretty much like a non-issue so let's just forget it and keep moving right along, shall we?

Sir Anthony Hopkins makes a surly, strong-willed and imposing kingly figure as Odin, but then again this guy's pretty awesome in most anything he does. Rene Russo is kept mostly to the sidelines as Thor's ever-worrying mother. With a hard-headed, blowhard war-monger AND a slick, devilishly-deceptive weasel for sons, who can blame her? Idris Elba proves to be a solid if unconventional choice as Bifrost guardian, Heimdall. The Warriors Three are all well-cast and a lot of fun; it's too bad they didn't have more to do. The love interest Jane Foster has been changed quite a bit from the comic origins, but it's more to modernize her than anything else. She was a typical 60's hand-wringing female in the comics, which certainly wouldn't sit very well with today's female audiences. I loved Stellan Skarsgrd as Erik Selvig, Foster's mentor & confidant. He helped make the film far better than it otherwise would have been. But it's Tom Hiddleston who steals the whole show as Thor's deliciously devious half-brother, Loki: God of Mischief. Hiddleston makes watching the entire movie worthwhile, ramping everything up another notch or two in every scene he's in.

The visuals rock! Asgard looks grand and the Rainbow Bridge shimmers like I always imagined it would in live action. The action bits are swell and Thor really gets to strut his stuff at the film's climax. Thor's hammer, Mj&ouml;lnir, looks properly cool and has all the powers it should. His costume isn't too far removed from what he sports in the comics. In fact, my only real bitch is the beyond-stupid decision to ditch Thor's helmet. It's an iconic and import piece of his wardrobe. There's just no excuse. It's inclusion during the beginning of the coronation ceremony is a nice nod but then, inexplicably, we never see it again! Sorry folks, but if I'm going into battle against a nigh-indestructible opponent like The Destroyer, I'd definitely want to have my noggin protected! WTF, Marvel??? The town in the middle of nowhere seemed rather contrived too, while I'm at it, but whatever. Overall, I enjoyed THOR and found it to be a fun time-waster and another solid entry in Marvel's ever-expanding roster of cross-referencing, tightly inter-connected superhero films. Video & audio for this DVD were excellent and the bonus features were nice, if a little thin. I bought my DVD used thru Amazon, so it was a real bargain. 4 STARS.",1420070400,2,3016,4.99403578528827

4575268,5,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR

I have always been a comic fan as far as I can remember so it did not take long for e to find Marvels Thor. From solo adventures to the Avengers he has always been an interesting character. So when the movie based on the character came out I was all about it. Luckily as it turned out the film was excellent, I really enjoyed it. They got the wonder, action, and humor of the character perfect in my opinion.

The film follows Thor, his brother Loki and his band of friends on Asgard as they go off on a revenge trip to the land of the Frost Giants after they attacked the kingdom of Odin, Thors father. After Odin bails them out he strips Thor of his power and sends him to Earth to learn a lesson. But all is not what it seems as it may have been a member of the royal family its self that orchestrated the entire thing. So as Thor is stuck on Earth one very close to him seeks the power of the throne back in Asgard.

I thought this film was done wonderfully from every aspect. The direction and writing was perfect for this type of film. The special effects were amazing especially on Asgard, the visuals were excellent. Of course the casting and acting was spot on with Chris Hemsworth doing a great job as the title character. I loved Kat Dennings in this, plus everybody was great. But the scene stealer here was Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is by far my favorite character and performance in the film which is saying something.

For the combo pack you get an excellent commentary from director Kenneth Branagh, deleted scenes and great behind the scenes and making of featurettes. Also you get the Marvel One Shot The Consultant which as usual is fun among other things. I have to say that this is well worth the money if you are a Marvel, comic, action, fantasy or just a movie fan.",1411430400,,1795,4.286135693215339

4575277,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Everything about the first Thor is pretty good, but Asgard is the one part of the movie where it truly shines. When you look back on the Avengers film, you can see that this movie is the true catalyst for that film, but in all honesty even in knowing that I still feel that where this film shines is in not thinking about that and enjoying the scenery of the different world's.

The true star of the film is Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki and does a masterful job at it. He is able to capture his character on screen better than any other, and he's a lot of fun to watch. It's worth renting or purchase just to watch him.",1410912000,,620,4.12396694214876

4575281,3,B0055EAJ7A,Pretty good but seems like a quick table setting for The Avengers movie. The story was enough to keep me engaged but certainly not on the edge of my seat. Hemsworth offered a solid Thor but I didn't buy the relationship between he and the Jane Foster character. Tom Hiddleston was deliciously evil as Loki and I thought Anthony Hopkins was a good choice for Odin. The Destroyer was one of the coolest Marvel creations I've seen on film.,1410652800,,436,4.531645569620253

No spoilers so let's just say it ended perfectly. To say more would give things away. Let me just say it went beyond my expectations and that's hard to do.

Whoever told Ben Stiles and Adam Sandler they can act needs to be force fed a steady diet of soap until their brains are functioning normal again.

4575432,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Modern times have shown an increase in the awareness of the old mythologies. These myths gave people a sense of the world around them. They explained the meaning of important phenomena in life that perplexed many. Thunder was said to have been caused by Thor's hammer, which incidentally forms an important theme in the recent movie.

The question of the hammer that has so much power with respect to the position of a King that requires so much responsibility is an interesting one. The idea that power must be used with responsibility and that the power of a ruler requires the greatest responsibility is a key element of the story. These lessons are an important part of Thor's ascension in the story.

Chris Hemsworth leads the cast in a laudable performance of a person who grows into being a leader. I don't think there was a weak link in the movie except for Odin who in the old myths was ageless because he had found a cure for old age.

4575447,4,B0055EAJ7A,"This was a lot of fun - I was expecting it to be silly, but it was actually pretty good. It's impossible not to kind of  feel for Loki, though, wrong as that's supposed to be!",1400457600,,175,3.861111111111111
4575448,5,B0055EAJ7A,"With one of the more intriguing and amusing villains I've seen since Alan Rickman in pretty much anything Alan Rickman has done. Chris Hemsworth is gorgeous, Natalie Portman is lovely, but this movie makes it clear Tom Huddleston's Loki is going to steal every scene he's in.",1400371200,,275,4.872340425531915
4575449,5,B0055EAJ7A,What a gorgeous Man!  He's yummy!!!  ;)  My husband will get after me if he sees this post!!!  Oh well!!  :),1400284800,,108,3.9523809523809526
4575450,5,B0055EAJ7A,I'm a big fan of the Marvel's Avengers movies to begin with.  I like a lot about this story.  And I'm really glad I've added it to my collection.,1400284800,,145,3.9655172413793105
4575451,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This is my favorite movie of the Marvel series, tied for second are The Avengers and Iron Man III, so maybe I have a thing for the god of thunder? The violence level on this movie is less than many of the others, and I happen to find the dialogue especially charming, not to mention the screen chemistry between Portman and Hemsworth is titillating. Agent Coulson even shows up!",1400198400,,378,4.492753623188406
4575452,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I was happy to see this, as I'd been putting of Marvel for a while.  I was happy to see that Anthony Hopkins appeared as Odin, as I love his acting.  Loki was fabulous, as always, and I was just..happy to have finally seen this!",1400112000,,228,4.044444444444444

4575455,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Being a long time fan of mythology and later of scifi/fantasy/heroic fantasy/sword & sorcery I decided to check out this movie.

The interaction of the ancient Norse gods in a modern setting made for an interesting film.  Not to say that a film set in the age of the Vikings would have been uninteresting.  The love interest of god and mortal was to be expected and did not disappoint.  I was less impressed with Loki, both the character and his helmet.  Overall the special effects were excellent.

Overall the movie was good but not great, That said,I did enjoy it and would recommend it.",1399939200,,590,4.625

4575458,5,B0055EAJ7A,If you want a good clean movie here it is. You will definitely want to buy it on blu-ray. Enjoy!,1399507200,,96,3.85

4575460,4,B0055EAJ7A,"But I will add more. I rented this only because I was looking for a ""hunk"" movie and figured Thor would do the job. Well, Hemsworth wasn't exactly the hunk I had anticipated. Sure, he had the physique, but not the face or the acting ability. I figured it would be a boring plot, but right from the beginning when Loki was introduced, it was wow! Oh, wow! Who the heck is that? The cross between his vulnerability, trying to get his father's love and acceptance, Kenneth Branagh's directing of the character...well, I fell in love with the villain! Odon is a jerk, and his treatment of Loki set the stage for Loki's actions. The God of mischief isn't quite as dark as prior villains and with the other characters pretty predictable and boring, it is Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki that makes this movie. It is also what made The Avengers and Thor II. I won't see Captain America movies or the other Avengers, because if they don't have Loki, they aren't worth my time. Marvel needs to create a series of Loki movies. There is enough in mythology to have a who franchise around Loki's antics. Let us see if they are smart enough to capitalize on Hiddleston's brilliance.",1399420800,2,1172,4.559241706161138

4575462,4,B0055EAJ7A,"A comic book tale, but at least the laughs weren't completely predictable.  The climax was totally predictable but still somehoe moving if in the right mood.",1399161600,,157,5.038461538461538
4575463,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I love the director of this film and I loved the story line better in this film. Sir Anthony Hopkins can really turn it on, the tears too. I really enjoyed this film.",1399075200,,166,4.0606060606060606

4575466,5,B0055EAJ7A,"While Marvel comics certainly are not for everyone, even those who aren't into graphic novels have been taken by Thor.  Chris Hemsworth plays a pretty convincing Thor... if there were ever a model in which to compare a Nordic god to.

4575467,1,B0055EAJ7A,Basically brand new dvd and it skips ahead on the movie for no apparent reason.  Even the DVD's I got from movie rental stores had the same skip in it.  I take the disc out and look for scratches and there are none.

If ever there was an actor born to play Thor, it was Chris.  You look at him and think ""how can a guy be THAT good looking AND have a body like that?""  There must be laws against that.  okay, okay...I know movie review.  Loved the movie, but then again, I love all of Stan Lee's movies - this one just gave me so much more extra eye candy to look at - - and I was so envious of Natalie Portman.",1398297600,,524,3.814814814814815

4575491,3,B0055EAJ7A,Great actors.  The plot just doesn't flow.  What works as a fable or a comic book tale doesn't always translate to a movie.  Superman comes to mind.  Years and years of comic books and TV programs just have trouble getting on the screen.,1397520000,,237,4.441860465116279

4575493,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Watched with my granddaughter 10 1/2 yrs  who really likes the marvel/comic book type movies.  I am not overly fond of them but  I am fond of her and like to do and see things with her.  There were some good ""laughs"" and at least not inappropriate  for her.",1397347200,,257,4.163265306122449
4575494,4,B0055EAJ7A,Chris H. is perfect as Thor and the actor who plays Loki is great.  Special effects make Thor's kingdom look impressive.  But Portman is sour note as her lack of chemistry with Thor makes their attraction unbelievable. And the wispy voice and flustered manner make it hard to believe in her as a rocket scientist.  More like a ditzy waitress.,1397347200,,342,4.666666666666667
4575495,5,B0055EAJ7A,This movie was so awesome! I loved the story. Strayed from the comics but still made the point. Loved it,1397347200,,104,4.25

4575497,3,B0055EAJ7A,The movie is great. I was just abut confused as to why I HAD to buy both the bluray AND DVD without being given the option of one or the other. I know I did not have to buy it at all but feel I paid a lot more for it because it has both discs.,1397088000,,243,3.357142857142857
4575498,5,B0055EAJ7A,Great characters...good job of technology but not over done and keeping it simple.  Turned into my top 10 action movie,1397088000,,118,4.9
4575499,4,B0055EAJ7A,"This is one of those movies I can watch over and over. While I do like Thor, the Dark World even more, this one sets everything up, revealing the complex love-hate relationship between Thor and his brother, Loki. It is here we learn about the events that set Loki on the path from being simply mischievous to the darkly psychopathic figure he becomes in The Avengers. The character of Thor changes as well, from a self-absorbed, spoiled, war hungry brat to a thoughtful, caring man who finally realizes the impact for good or bad his choices have not just for himself, but for those around him. Both character developments are the most interesting part of the movie for me. I like how Marvel Studios have made these movies appealing to both genders; typically, these kinds of movies are what my daughter refers to as ""dick flicks"". But Marvel has smart people running it and working for them, and they know how to create stories that appeal to everyone. Nicely done!",1397001600,5,966,4.688235294117647
4575500,4,B0055EAJ7A,Wasn't sure what to expext when we rented but this is pretty good as far as action movies go.  Needless to say Thor is pretty easy to watch.  We then rented the sequel.  The good news is Thor is just as hot. Bad news is that one is pretty boring.  Get this one and forget the sequel.,1397001600,,283,3.912280701754386
4575501,5,B0055EAJ7A,This movie was well made and I enjoyed it. The special effects were done very well and I would watch it again,1397001600,,109,4.0

4575504,5,B0055EAJ7A,"When the Marvel Cinematic Universe was still in its infancy, Marvel Studios  could botched things as easily as got them right.  Well, at this point, history knows how its played out and, looking ahead, seems to continue that run of good fortune.  Thor was a gutsy movie to attempt so early in the development of the MCU, as a lot of what happens seems to border on magic.  It was a well-thought-out move, though, as it established that the outlandish can stand next to the more grounded elements and not look out of place; that it's all a cohesive whole.

I have yet to get to the main selling point of this set (the 3D version of the movie), but hopefully will be able to amend this review later with impressions of the 3D portion.  I owned the 2D set since it was released, and, seeing as how the rest of this set is exactly the same as that one, my opinion remains the same: a retrospective on the character would've been nice. The set is, sadly, lacking in bonus features, which seems to be Marvel's MO of late.  The One-Shots are great, but more BTS-type stuff would be great.  Overall, though, it's a worthwhile set.",1397001600,,1122,4.412621359223301
4575505,5,B0055EAJ7A,I have enjoyed these a great deal.  The new movie was just as good as this one.  Hope to see more.,1396915200,,98,3.619047619047619
4575506,4,B0055EAJ7A,We like superhero action movies and this one was actually better than the first one.  I loved the ending this time.  It is best to watch both the Thor movies together.,1396828800,,167,4.354838709677419

Those Abs!  Many many funny one liners that the entire franchise is known for at this point.  And I love the way the movie (and Marvel Studios) has mixed the other characters you have seen before and will see again into this movie and others.  Really makes it come together.

Each person plays their role well, even Loki, whom you will love to hate and feel for.  Really the bad guys have the better parts in movies and Loki is no exception.  He's just misunderstood!",1396137600,,642,4.372881355932203

I could select 5.1 in French or Spanish and then select subtitles in English, but I do not care to watch a movie that is produced, recorded and released on the American English market that requires the use of subtitles simply because some ""GENIUS"" at Paramount, or Sony, saw fit NOT to include 5.1 or less on the audio track! The DVD version, which is on now, has no such requirement and is playing nicely! But, I have a Sony Region Free BDP-S5100 with Blue tooth, internet, and 3D capability and I am now wondering if future purchases of Blue ray discs will have the same 7.1 DTS audio track? I guess I sell this player and return to watching DVDs instead!

Of course this Thor is the same. Loves his family, his people, all the surrounding planets or in our world, surrounding States and Cities. A true Soldier/Warrior. Respect his parents and even loves his troublesome brother! I have to say I really like this Loki character. Yes he is bad and self enter. But got the attitude of Garfield the Cat and really comical. So yeah I don't think you can have a Thor flick without Loki. Together the brothers compliment each other, tho you wish Loki wasn't so destructive on humankind like he can be. Yes we have romance, anger, some really Ugly bad guys, a crazy Professior and comedy and unfortunately loss of a loved one. So Thor's like us and his home has problems as ours does and we too lose Loved Ones. He just does it with grace and one Heck of a hammer!!
Can't wait for the new Captian America coming to theaters 4/4/14!

In the stories Jane Foster is a paramedic I believe and I can see her playing a paramedic but an astrophysicist?  Thor does come off like an all brawn no brain sort but that stays true to what I know of the character prior to now.  The best by far was Tom Hiddleson he played Loki oh so well.  I actually cannot picture anyone else playing his role and doing it better.  The story was rich insofar as stories go but then again these characters are just being brought to life out of comic books and cartoons.

He had real enemies but none where any match for Thor's great hammer.  Of course, having Anthony Hopkins in a move is always a plus.  He is so good and I have never seen him blow a part.  He is always believable in his role.  I did really enjoy this fantasy movie.  It was entertaining and kind of catches you up in the fantasy.  You can bet Thor2 will be coming.",1393545600,,644,4.088

Which is about the kind of mashup which happens in this movie, with Stellan Skarsgard running naked through Stonehenge, then lecturing the residents of an old folks home about convergent reality, Thor hanging up his hammer on a hat rack and then asking directions on the Tube in London to Greenwich, meanwhile sailing a longboat/viking ship rocket while being chased by other longboat/viking ships through Asgard.

We did not intend to purchase this trailer of Thor as we already have this DVD.  We had intended to watch ""Thor  2 /Dark World"" which I guess is not available for viewing yet.  Is there any way you can refund this purchase to us?",1393372800,,241,4.0638297872340425
4575599,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Well, actually, I more love 'Loki' than Thor who is rash, arrogant and given to fits of temper.  In fact, one of these tantrums gets him banished to Midgard (Earth) until he learns to give more thought to his actions.

Loki is *smart* but feels over-shadowed by his brother and when he finds out in the worst possible way where Odin 'adopted' him from, all Hel breaks loose.  Literally.  Odin has to be worst dad *ever* when Loki asks why he was adopted and Thor's not much of a brother either.  ""Brother know your place.""  Really?  I wanted to kick him and could hardly blame Loki for his lies or his attempt to kill Thor later.  Frankly, I'd have done something much earlier for all the insults and general snotiness.  Thor may have thought he was joking around, but you can see in Loki's face that he doesn't feel that at all.

The movie is really well done, though.  The action sequences are exciting and the characterization excellent.  The settings are spectacular and the *music* is . . . well, it fits perfectly.  I just wish they'd left in the deleted scenes because you really get a much better feel for the characters - Loki and Frigga especially.",1393200000,3,1158,4.509615384615385

4575601,3,B0055EAJ7A,I thought it was o.k. Didn't really set the world on fire. A little too sci-fi for me if you will.,1392854400,,98,3.7142857142857144
4575602,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I am a huge Spiderman fan, and I thought the first Spiderman Movie (Sam Raimi's version) was long overdue and near epic standards (the second one was better.) I mention the Spiderman movie because, with the exception of Superman (yes I know it's D.C.), I tend to compare all hero movies to those.

I have occasionally read Thor when I was growing up, but never truly got into his story, so seeing it on the screen gave me a little insight into him.  I am aware that movies don't tend to go too indepth into a character, versus reading it in the comics, but I felt this movie did a good job overall.

I have a thing for Natalie Portman, so seeing her in this was a treat.  The other actors also did good jobs in their roles, however, the actor that portrayed Loki, I felt stole the show.  He actually had me believing he was good, versus the trickster he is known as.

Overall, this was a solid movie, but I hope the second installment is better.",1392854400,,945,4.280898876404494

He's as very bit of Thor as he is hot. I love it! The backgrounds of Asgard is wonderful and costumes are very professional. Its all amazing!!!,1392768000,,322,4.209677419354839

Much is made of Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki--and rightfully so.  However, it is Hemsworth who gets the thankless job of being the good guy, but he manages to make Thor understandable and charming.  Anthony Hopkins is, of course, magnificent as Odin.  The supporting cast doesn't get to do much, but they do well with what they're given.

My only complaint is Branaugh's direction.  While the Shakespearean influence is appropriate, it sometimes translates into a stage-bound, flat-footed visual style--especially during the final conflict between Thor and Loki.",1391904000,,676,5.203703703703703

In Ironman and The Avengers, The Marvel style of tilted cinematography  and fast movement during action scenes was making me nauseous. I also found them more violent than necessary.

4575634,4,B0055EAJ7A,"*Thor* is a fine entry in the superhero genre. It isn't revolutionary in any way, but the story is well told and well acted.

I remember watching the cartoon version of *Thor* back in the 70s, and that was pretty awful. Since that has been my only real exposure to the character and stories, I haven't been eager to see the movie. Then I saw *The Avengers* and decided maybe I needed to watch it after all. Glad I did.

Chris Hemsworth brings a good bit of range to the character, which I wasn't expecting. Natalie Portman gives life and some breadth to the standard mortal girlfriend role. Sir Anthony Hopkins' Odin shows us power, wisdom, and vulnerability.

I was surprised in reflecting on the film how extensively Thor serves as a Christ-figure metaphor. Won't line it out here, but it's pretty strong for a Norse god. This doesn't really affect my appreciation of the movie that much, but maybe the extra half-star I would give it if I could.",1391385600,,948,4.564705882352941

4575676,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Loved it as usual Kenneth Branagh is a great director and actor and what to say about Chris Hemsworth absolutely gorgeous and I believe was born to be ""Thor"" god of anything. Natalie Portman is also an excellent actress. Looking forward the next one.",1389139200,,250,4.704545454545454

4575679,4,B0055EAJ7A,"While I wouldn't say this is the best super hero movie of all time, this was a great introduction to the character in Marvel's movie universe. The story is relatively well-done, if a bit straightforward. There's plenty of humor and awesome hammer-throwing action. If you're looking for a complete picture of the lead-up to Avengers and Marvel's next generation of films, this is a must-have for your collection.",1389052800,,411,5.0588235294117645

4575681,3,B0055EAJ7A,"This is a pretty good action flick, but not Marvel's best.  Chris Hemsworth is excellent as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston steals every scene he's in as Loki, but Natalie Portman doesn't have much opportunity to build a real relationship with her brawny demigod. If Branaugh had stolen a couple of minutes from the set-piece battles and devoted them to the Thor/Jane story line the film would have felt more balanced.",1388966400,,411,4.871428571428571

The magic of the Nordic myths is brought to life by the visual effects of the modern film age.  Thor, Loki, Odin, the Frost Giants, all of them, breath and come to life.  Then throw them into modern small town America with the NSA and you have a movie worth watching.  I am eagerly awaiting the second movie to develop the story even further.  This is a great movie.",1388793600,,480,4.409090909090909

4575691,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I had not seen this movie prior to see The Avengers so it was a nice back story on who and what Loki was and his relationship with his brother, Thor.  I really like how Marvel is connecting these movies together and coming together in one movie which was The Avengers.  Watching the movies ""backwards"" if you will, gave a different perspective on the movies and did not take away the content by watching it in this manner.  Thor was a movie that was very well done and explained a lot of parts that were missing.  I would absolutely recommend this movie.",1388620800,,554,4.401960784313726

This movie was entertaining for me.  Not too much sci-fi and not too much realism.  Not sure how to explain it much more than that.  Entertainment value was held for me.,1388188800,,347,4.444444444444445

4575721,4,B0055EAJ7A,"The special effects are amazing, attractive and gigantic.

The action is non-stop. Yet, 45 minutes into the movie, the excitement substantially subsides. It's because Thor's fighting skills look very limited. He whacks the enemies with his hammer; he flies; he throws punches; he slams his body against the opponents. That's all. It's repetitive to the point of boring after watching those scenes for a while.

Adding to the problem above, there's very little character depth. The film barely touches brotherhood and father-and-son relationship.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, as of today, Dec. 12, 2013, below are the financial figures of this movie:

Release Date: Nov. 8, 2013
Production Budget: $170 million
Domestic: $194,618,631
+ Foreign: $416,700,000
= Worldwide: $611,318,631

So far,it took in 441 million dollars more than its production cost. That's an enormous amount.

4575763,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Out of all the marvel movies that are connected to this one, I have to admit it's not my favorite but I did enjoy it and recently saw the sequel Thor 2 which I like even better than this one. I can't talk anyone into liking or disliking a movie. Personally I enjoyed this movie, and I'm glad to have it in my collection. I would like to have all the marvel movies in this connected universe in Blu-ray the only problem I had was with the digital download.
First off it's not Ultraviolet.
Second the redemption code was missing even though I bought it new to make sure I got my redemption code.
Fortunately when I googled the issue I found Paramount Digital Copy websites and filled out a small form. A few days later I got an email with the code so that's nice. Apparently this is something that happens so at least some people are prepared. Still I'd prefer ultraviolet through flixster.",1386720000,4,888,4.387878787878788

4575784,5,B0055EAJ7A,"First, a word about my perspective. I am heathen rather than a Marvel fan. (I'm the author of Asatru For Beginners, so I am steeped in heathenry.) There were things in this movie that drove me batty until I got used to them. For example: the idea that Thor's father made him human and sent him to Earth, which essentially turns him into a Christ figure, is a bit sacrilegious even from a Christian perpective, let alone an Asatru one.  The shirt-free scenes are clearly meant to invite thinking of Thor as a sex object, which is a bit easier to swallow. Pardon the pun. He acts like a clueless relic of the Viking Age, unfamiliar with cars and tasers, but speaks modern English (the archaic semi-Shakespearean diction is in no wise what someone who hasn't been back to Earth since the days of Ragnar Lothbrok would use.) Not to mention the Mary-Sueish human heroine, when we all know Thor is married to Sif. I found it all a bit shocking in the theater -- I mean, these are our gods, after all -- but the story grew on me, and now that I've seen it again in my living room I can't help but love it to death.

Thor himself must love it, too, or at least love that Americans honored him with a movie and little children are calling his name. And people are sacrificing coffee to him instead of goats. Which is a lot less messy. When this movie was in the theaters, it rained a LOT that summer. Now there is another Thor movie in the theaters (The Dark World) and again it rained a LOT this summer. So he must approve.",1386201600,,1515,4.293706293706293

4575801,4,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was a lot of fun!  Just campy enough to be comic book, but not so campy as to make you roll your eyes.  Honestly I would have preferred it to be a little bit longer so we could get some more back story on the human characters -- Jane, Darcy, Eric -- in addition to the Asgardians.  I really enjoyed everyone's performances, though Tom Hiddleston's Loki is by far the most engaging character.

Some of the cinematography was far too clever by half, with dizzying CGI landscapes that, while beautiful, were too dark or too abstract to really appreciate.  But when Brannagh pointed the camera at real landscapes and real people instead of CGI constructs, it was wonderful.

Fun, exciting, beautiful colors (Thor's cape, the gold of Heimdall's armor, Loki's turquoise eyes - everything pops), and really good performances from all the leads and the supporting cast.  If you're looking for a movie to wile away an evening, I certainly recommend Thor.",1386028800,,956,4.7926829268292686

4575830,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I remember when this film came out in the theater I couldn't get anyone to watch it with me. Half of them thought it looked stupid and the other half thought it would be some mystical/magical thing and that really turned them off. But the reviews were positive and something...made me want to give it a chance.

After seeing this film I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was genuinely amazing by how much better it was than it could have been. Whenever you get into a story that blurs the lines of the real world and a fantasy world, you are treading on dangerous ground. On the one hand if it's too realistic it comes across as odd, cheesy, and boring. If you go to far on the fantasy side it starts to feel like a cartoon with no dramatic real-world weight. But this film manages to walk the line, and walk it well.

Critics can laugh and poke fun at the worlds of Thor all they want, but in the end, they are believable within the universe the film creates, and have depth beyond the spectacular battles and scenery-chewing of it's characters. And this springs from a genuinely heartfelt simple story of a fish-out-of-water who grows up.

At the start of the film, it is quickly established that Thor is a good-hearted, hard-fighting, handsome, and shallow being who only wants glory and is quick to lose his temper. After making a series of horribly selfish errors in judgement, he is banished to Midgard, the realm of humans, where he meets a team of scientists and hilarity ensues. There is no plot in the human world, only gentle character-building as Thor interacts with others, and slowly loses his arrogance through coming to build real relationships with ordinary people.

His mischief-causing brother is naturally up-to-no-good at the same time, and Thor has to grow as a person in time to save-the-day back home. What makes this extraordinary is the incredible sincerity that is brought to the character of Thor. When his transformation is complete, and he truly becomes WORTHY to wield the power he was born to, it is a great moment in comic book films indeed.

All of this is aided by better-than-usual special effects (the other realms are so pretty your irises want to weep), great music, and witty, well-written dialog combined with good-natured humor.

In the end, this film was handled just about perfectly. The only small downside I can see is that the Arizona sets look a bit low budget compared to everything else (not bad, just a little too made-for-TV). I highly recommend this film to anyone who is fan of comic books or comic book films, and even moreso to anyone anyone who is a sci-fi/fantasy fan and appreciates a well-made film.",1385510400,2,2662,4.677350427350428

4575837,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Hello, it is Thor. It is part of Marvel's Phase 1. It is a good story and Asgard is stunning. I was a little disappointed in the Warriors Three, but Loki more than made up for it.",1385424000,,179,3.864864864864865
4575838,4,B0055EAJ7A,Great movie if you are into Marvel Comics and enjoy action packed movies.  The special effects were pretty good as well.,1385424000,,120,4.714285714285714

4575843,4,B0055EAJ7A,"If you are nostalgic for comic book stories, this is an action adventure film that fills the bill.  It takes a certain suspension of conscious reality in order not to get hung up on the violations of scientific principle, but if you can manage it you'll find this work very entertaining and the special effects a treat for the eye.",1385337600,,331,4.516666666666667
4575844,5,B0055EAJ7A,My Avengers loving family loved this movie. Everyone thought Thor was better than the other movies Hulk and Captain America.,1385251200,,124,5.25
4575845,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Story is abbreviated, plot confusing, love interest manufactured. Outside of the special effects, movie is a bore. Need a better effort on the next one. This character has always been my favorite but Marvel did take the same care in creating this as they did with the first Iron Man.",1385251200,,283,4.68
4575846,5,B0055EAJ7A,Compelling story told through fine acting and believable performances and great special effects. Another successful movie that explains mythology and legends through the discovery of a more advanced society that visited a primative earth.,1385251200,,238,6.029411764705882

4575848,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was very good. But I never understood why Loki had to wear a coat, as a god, he shouldn't have gotten cold here on earth, since he didn't get cold enough to wear a coat on the ice planet.",1385164800,,198,3.8536585365853657

4575853,5,B0055EAJ7A,Thor really rocks. Epic adventure in Marvel land. Casting of Loki was perfect...you want to hurt that guy yourself. Natalie Portman..do I need to say anymore?,1385164800,,158,5.115384615384615
4575854,5,B0055EAJ7A,Great movie. I love the Marvel stuff so I will be anxiously awaiting the release of the second installment on DVD.,1385078400,,114,4.476190476190476

4575858,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Due to the lack of plot, and subsequent lack of rising action, climax, and falling action, I was left feeling rather bored throughout and unsatisfied by the conclusion of the film. Where was the tension? Furthermore, the romance seemed tacked on as an afterthought, and Natalie Portman's character overall (unfortunately) came off as obnoxious due to her one-dimmensionality and redundancy. I had low expectations since I saw the Avengers prior to watching this film and did not like it, but even then, Thor left me wanting.",1385078400,,524,5.104651162790698

4575866,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Great, fun movie but the 3D conversion is okay, not spellbinding. None of the Marvel 3D conversions have been that impressive, at least not yet. It is my hope that they start filming in 3D, rather than up-converting from 2D.",1384905600,,224,4.625
4575867,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Fun superhero movie to watch, Hemsworth is very good.  Watch it before you see the new one, and turn up the sound.",1384905600,,114,4.181818181818182
4575868,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This is one of those movies where your experience is completely dependent on what you're expecting.  I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Chris Hemsworth did a brilliant job and the cinematography and CG was fantastic.  I'm sorry I didn't watch this sooner.  I can't wait to see the sequel.",1384819200,,325,4.75

4575875,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor was surprisingly smart, funny and yet respectful of the character and the Avenger series.  I have heard that the Avenger series is written to appeal to women as well as men.  Thor definitely manages to do this and without becoming a ""chick flick.""
There is plenty of action but the characters are also well developed.  Demi-gods have family issues too.  Of course their family squabbles can level a small town in New Mexico.",1384732800,,429,4.756756756756757
4575876,5,B0055EAJ7A,"First time I watched THOR I thought it was OK, but the thing is I have watched THOR around 6 times since and I can't remember when I have ever done that with another film.

4575899,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I really enjoy how the Thor character was adapted for the big screen. I admit I didn't know much about this character prior to seeing him in the movies, but my impression was most elements about him were very magical in nature. In the movies they use the famous science fiction trope of magic simply being sufficiently advanced technology. I think this was a wise decision as it better connects this character to the rest of the Marvel universe which has a much more science fiction feel (the Iron Man suit, gamma radiation and the Hulk, etc.) Rather than being a God from the fantasy world of Asgard, he is really more of an alien from another dimension.  Likewise, his powers and those of his adversaries are really examples of high technology, which to us mere mortals of Earth seem like magic.

Chris Hemsworth was a perfect choice for the casting of Thor. Not only does he perfectly fill out the role of muscled Viking warrior, but he does a great job of taking the character from arrogance, to humility, and finally to redemption. The supporting cast likewise did an excellent job. The humorous moments provided a nice balance to the action and turmoil, without ever feeling campy.

The story itself wasn't quite as compelling as the first Iron Man, but was still a solid origin story and does a good job of setting up a lot of elements for the later movies (including the Avengers movie).",1384387200,2,1395,4.6396761133603235

4575921,5,B0055EAJ7A,"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a film this much that I didn't see in the theatres. Everything from the score, to the effects, to the acting were really superb. I thought Tom Hiddleston (Loki) was fantastic and as an actor myself, was really drawn into his performance. (Hope he gets a Loki centered film in the future.) Chris Hemsworth was completely charming and believable as Thor and I found myself wishing Asgard was a real place I could go visit... ;-) Instantly, I could tell that this film was a cut above when I read the cast list and then was even more thrilled when I saw Kenneth Branagh as the director. I mean, really, how can you go wrong?

Enjoy the film, get a bucket of popcorn and take the ride!",1384214400,,722,4.348148148148148
4575922,5,B0055EAJ7A,Great action movie with just enough romance to make it interesting. Loved the interplay between the characters and especially Thor and Loke.,1384214400,,140,5.409090909090909

4575924,1,B0055EAJ7A,"I feel asleep (snoozed) twice in the first 30  minutes.  It was slow, boring, and never got me interested in watching any more.  Essentially, a dud.",1384128000,,148,4.615384615384615
4575925,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I usually don't really like superhero movies as they are often rife with bad acting, unworthy scripts, and 2 dimensional characters; Special effects are often used as a way to hide the fact that there is not much of a story.  Having said that- Thor fairs fairly well as far as this genre goes.  Primarily due to the character Loki and the brilliant actor who portrays him.

Whether you are someone who lived under the shadow of a sibling or someone who felt lied to & betrayed by family.. whether you're someone who felt they weren't ever given a fair chance growing up or someone who was raised by a cold and restrictive parent.. or whether you were just someone who has felt like an outsider for much of their lives, chances are you're going to feel some sort of affinity toward Loki.  And lets face it.  This is going to mean a huge part of the population.  Is there any wonder people gravitate toward this character unlike any other?  Out of all the superhumans in the marvel universe thus far, Loki is by far the most human.

Thor is an oaf who's idea of fun is literally pounding his way through things.  At the beginning especially, he is completely ruled by his ego and emotions. This changes somewhat through the course of the movie.  Though not necessarily stupid, Thor is not really intelligent either.  His idea of war includes no forethought and no strategy.  What Thor does have aside from his massive structure is a lot of heart and conviction so he's overall a decent human being with a strong sense of self.  Conversely Loki is a guy who thinks before he acts.  Though he has a mischevious side, he is very intelligent (and at least at first) is able to put aside his ego and emotions for the greater good-  that is until he finds out his entire life is a lie and he basically snaps.  At the risk of sounding like someone who is excusing Loki's very serious misdeeds- one might even go as far as to say that Loki's ""turn"" is merely an exercise in reaching out for another identity after he so abruptly lost his.

The movie is not perfect by far.  In fact, if it weren't for Loki it would've been a bit of a throw-a-way like most other movies of this genre.  Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor, but the script fails him sometimes.  The romance between Thor and Jane is difficult to swallow.  The idea that a brilliant physicist falls head over heels for a witless oaf like Thor (as he can be described in the beginning of the movie)  just because he fills out his shirt well is a hard sell and unfortunately, this film doesn't even bother to try to sell it.  Thor's interest in Jane is also a bit of a mystery as they have nothing in common. We're simply asked to accept this romance without ever being given any reason to care whether or not they come together - or stay together for that matter.  Some scenes were choppy.  Though not a perfect movie, it is by far the best superhero movie I've personally seen to date.",1384041600,,2936,4.402597402597403

4575943,4,B0055EAJ7A,"With the release of the highly anticipated sequel already upon us, I felt it to be practically necessary to do a review on the movie Thor.

I am familar with different cultural mythology, so I have heard of Thor. And I remember 2011 well; mainly because I expected Captain America to be better than Thor. Captain America was a good movie, but after viewing Thor for the first time, I had to go back and read some of the comics. Yes, as an adaptation and a  movie, Thor delivers all the goods.

Thor stars Chris Hemsworth as the man himself, with a supporting cast that consists of:  Anthony Hopkins,  Kat Dennings, Idris Elba, Natalie Portman, Jamie Alexander, to name a few. Also starring in the villainous role, Tom Hiddleston playing Loki. I won' t say he stole the show; only because I feel each person played his/her part well, but he did a really awesome job playing Loki. Between Tom Hiddleston, Michael Fassbender, and Benedict Cumberbatch, I simply can't decide who plays the better villain. But the acting in Thor is great.

The set designs and costumes/makeup in Thor (example: Frost Giants) were well drawn/set up. And the CGI is pretty good as well.

The story is also well executed. It is not as complex as one might think , so it is easy to enjoy, not just for the eye candy ladies (and you too gentlemen) but because Thor does justice not just to Thor the hero, but to Thor as the god of thunder.

If you like movies with superheroes and you have not yet seen Thor, go watch it. It proves to be a solid outing from Marvel Studios.

He has very good chemistry with everyone he shares a scene with, but especially the adorable Natalie Portman (at her most likable in this film).

Anyone familiar with the comics knows the backstory but this really holds its own in preparation for 'The Avengers'.

Coupling this with Captain America: The First Avenger does, what i believe was the intent, a superb job at setting the stage for The Avengers.

The casting is excellent.  A serious Top-Shelf group of actors and actresses cast excellently in their respective roles.
This film is a keeper in my book.",1382140800,,536,4.9222222222222225

Director Kenneth Branagh brings depth to the writers story, and Natalie Portman adds a classy element. She quotes Arthur C. Clarke, that ""Magic is just science we don't understand yet."" And Science Fiction is a precursor to Science-fact. Of course Chris Hemsworth (excellent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B002PMPTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>) is perfect, but a real treat is Stellan Skarsgrd as scientist Erik Selvig, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin (plus ravens). Erik might laugh at the thought that Thor claims the old stories are true, but after the two have a few boilermakers, Thor carries him home, saying ""We drank, we fought, he made his ancestors proud.""

Other than that, the movie shines, as one would expect from Marvel. The storyline is strong, character evolution convincing, and of course the battle scenes and special effects were superb.

I liked the idea of the nine realms and the movie jumps back and forth between them with ease, which was a refreshing change for most movies like this. The story chronicles a few battles between thor's enemies and eventually the showdown at the end of the movie against a surprise enemy. Sadly I did not care for the actor they cast as Thor. nor for the relationship that develops between the girl and thor.

4576040,3,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was made for Thor fans, and that's fine. But for somebody who had never been exposed to the Thor comics, the movie is tough to follow. There are a lot references that aren't explained fully. It's hard to get lost unless you are already familiar with the universe.

I will say, continuity references aside, there's a lot to like about this movie. The special effects really work. This movie makes great use of CGI effects with Thor's homeworld and the rainbow bridge. Stunning.

The acting and characterization of Thor and Loki were also better than they deserved to be for a film with such a silly premise. The relationship between Thor, Odin, and Loki is actually a wonderful depiction of a twisted royal family. Unlike in Avengers, Loki is portrayed as a complex villain with deep motives. The human characters, unfortunately, were forgettable.

4576082,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  To be honest, Thor is probably my favorite movie of the MCU so far, including the Avengers.  I even like this film more than Iron Man which was also a great film.  People are somewhat mixed on the film.  Some love it, while others do not care for it.  I personally really enjoyed this film.  I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always.  Natalie Portman also gives a great performance.  The villain is a very cunning and very relatable villain.  The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.

The story is quite simple.  Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants.  Asghard won the war.  Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin.  Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war.  For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person.  There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person.  Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.

The story is basically a coming of age story.  The story is generic, but sometimes generic works.  I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey.  The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him.  As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.

Natalie Portman does a great job here as well.  Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proven herself as a great actress.  She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the Star Wars prequels.  She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything.  People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary.  The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character.  Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that.  I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.

The villain Loki is also great.  Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie.  He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations.  You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy.  Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself.  You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.

The effects of this film are Breathtaking.  Though I like the Earth stuff for the most part I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm.  The CGI is simple beautiful.  The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film.  I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.

Overall, Thor is a great coming of age story.  Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action.  However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong.  If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out.  Hopefully Thor 2 will be just as awesome if not more so.",1379894400,,3584,4.368740515933232

4576086,3,B0055EAJ7A,This movie is like a lot today...it has ongoing special effects and delights the imagiination.  Its common entertainment for today's movie public.  We'll watch it again.,1379808000,,169,5.461538461538462

4576089,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise.  An excellent cast with amazing CG effects.  The good guys are really good, the romance is well played and believable.  The bad guys are evil but not very scary so the younger set can watch.  Overall a great action, adventure movie.  Again if you like this super hero movies this is a must watch.",1379721600,,337,4.459016393442623

4576091,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I really liked the way that Thor ""grew"" in his understanding of Grace and Mercy similar to how a boy grows up into a man.  Unlike most Hollywood/New York media these days, His charactor acurately shows what Manhood is really supposed to look like...sacrificing oneself for the good of others.  Our Military does this every day.",1379635200,,327,4.821428571428571
4576092,2,B0055EAJ7A,"I am sorry it may be good, but I just could not keep watching it.  I lost interest.

I guess it just was not my kinda movie.",1379635200,,124,3.5555555555555554

4576097,4,B0055EAJ7A,"OK, there have been better movies made of characters in the Marvel Universe. On the other hand there have been MUCH worse, and THIS one was really and truly necessary--we HAD to meet our big blonde buddy and understand his noble nature and lack of cultural sophistication and his bloody HUGE ego, prior to being able to experience the enormous fun of The Avengers. So while it's true that the plot in this one is pretty obvious and PARTICULARLY true that the characters lack a bit in polish, that's kinda the whole POINT here dontchaknow.  So it's well worth watching, especially given that all of them are really colorful--there's not a ONE of them in the entire MOVIE that I wouldn't enjoy going drinking with, including even the BAD GUYS. And it's nice to see that Nat is improving in her choice of men--last time it was a Sith Lord but THIS time it's a GOD--one with feet of clay to be sure but at least she didn't decide to shack up with LOKI!  So if only for HER sake, buy this one and enjoy it--or Nick will be FURIOUS and and the God of Thunder will be MIGHTY THOR........",1379462400,2,1080,4.395

4576099,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I have to say at the outset that it was my husband's choice of movie for the night and I mentally rolled my eyes. However, it actually was okay. A little strange, as these ""comic-based"" movies tend to be, but there was an actual plot that you could actually follow and there was even a little humor. I would rent it.",1379462400,,316,4.19672131147541

4576101,5,B0055EAJ7A,I liked it because it dealt in how jealously and lies can destroy not only a person but a world!,1379376000,,96,3.85
4576102,5,B0055EAJ7A,"For years I was shocked that Marvel failed to put any real video out on the market. While DC seemed obsessed with repeating Batman to the point of being sickening.

Now we finally get to see some of the Marvel universe and Thor is an excellent contribution to the world. Marvel has taken a classic character from their many universes and woven it into its own original story.

Recommended for anyone who has enjoyed Marvel Comics, looking for a good action movie, or just wants to understand the universe that is Marvel.",1379376000,,520,4.641304347826087

4576104,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Good special effects and some decent action.  Romantic angle didn't work though.  Overall story was OK, but not great.  Not the worst, but not the best comic book movie.",1379289600,,169,4.758620689655173
4576105,4,B0055EAJ7A,I bought this for my husband. He's watched it so many times I'm surprised it still plays.  Good gift idea for super-power fans.,1379203200,,127,4.521739130434782
4576106,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Great Film.  Keeps to the lore of Marvel and the Parthenon of Norse mythology.  Special effects are first rate, acting is well done.  You truly hate Thor at the beginning.  The story unfolds nicely and moves well.",1379203200,,213,4.675675675675675

4576111,5,B0055EAJ7A,"For me, I watched the movie the adventures first , so this movie  filled in some character holes about Thor",1379030400,,107,4.35
4576112,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I personally love the character development in this movie, particularly of Thor. It's believable and heartfelt. Natalie Portman pulls off the female nerd role very well, and, try as I might to hate her for being the love interest, she's just too adorable!",1378944000,,255,4.953488372093023
4576113,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Wanted to catch up on the solo films before Avengers 2 came out. This movie wasn't horrible, but I also wouldn't say it was great. Thor is clearly a kicker of asses but the plot was kinda meh.",1378944000,,192,4.078947368421052
4576114,5,B0055EAJ7A,"At first I was disappointed with the hair, I mean the comic book Thor had beautiful long golden locks. Aside from that it was action pack and his vulerabilty was quite funny.",1378857600,,174,4.46875
4576115,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I like this picture because of the theme, and messages.  To summarize: if you want to be better you have to be humble, If you want to be supreme you have to sacrifice yourself and live to serve, and science and magic are the same...",1378857600,,232,4.155555555555556

4576117,5,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR's cast of Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins are excellent. I thought Kenneth Branagh's direction was very good. The story line was captivating. THOR has been around a while and this film captured the very essence of his realm.",1378857600,,270,5.159090909090909
4576118,3,B0055EAJ7A,the movie isn't as action packed and exciting as i thought it would be. The love story between thor and the scientist is not very compelling.,1378771200,,141,4.461538461538462

4576122,5,B0055EAJ7A,If you like the superhero/comic movies this is a must have. Chris Hemswoth is a great actor and looks the part.,1378684800,,111,4.333333333333333

4576132,4,B0055EAJ7A,Just needed to zone out by myself without wife the other night so I watched Thor with Amazon Prime on my Roku.  I'm a sci-fi / action /adventure fan so this fit right in for me.  While not up to the level of Star Trek movies I found the movie entertaining and interesting enough for what I was looking for.  Good story line with good graphics.  Acting is fair.  Amazon Prime is awesome.  Roku is awesome.,1378512000,,404,4.25

4576137,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I was really surprised to find out that this movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh. I quite enjoyed the result. I think the casting was good and the settings were beautifully done, particularly Asgard. I'm not a comic-book fan; so I have no idea how this jives with the Thor comic books. I just know that I enjoyed the movie in that light superhero action way. I think that the one thing I would have changed is Thor's banishment on Earth. It would have been more effective if it had lasted a little longer than two or three days. Still, I enjoyed the movie and I may even be willing to pay to see the sequel in the movie theater this fall.

I watched this via streaming HD on my Kindle, and I was impressed with the picture quality and the smoothness of the playback. It works very well, and I'm glad that I had the chance to stream it as I may not have ever watched it otherwise.",1378252800,,881,4.21301775147929

4576145,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was a hard sell for me.  I've always enjoyed mythology, but turning ancient God's into aliens was quite a leap.  However, the movie was well done and turned out very good.  We look forward to seeing the new Thor movie.",1378166400,,229,4.404761904761905
4576146,4,B0055EAJ7A,"We needed something fun for a Friday stay home and watch a movie night and this movie fit the bill. Nothing deep, but plain ol good entertainment with no strings or weird feelings afterward. We actually cannot wait until the sequel comes out.",1378166400,,242,4.651162790697675

4576173,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Tempering its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and just a little dose of dramatics, Thor is a super-charged fantasy epic that can stand alone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1377734400,,174,5.0344827586206895
4576174,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Good movie. Natalie Portman doesn't add much to it but Chris Hemsworth is very good as Thor, the conceited son of Odin and heir to the Asgardian throne. Thor becomes humbled and learns self sacrifice when he is banished to earth.  Everyman SHIELD agent Phil Coleson gets a decent sized part as well in this Marvel superheroe film",1377734400,,329,4.672413793103448
4576175,4,B0055EAJ7A,With great special effects and a good story line I enjoyed this movie vety much Branagh did a good job keeping the elements of the original theme intact,1377734400,,152,4.464285714285714
4576176,5,B0055EAJ7A,I have really enjoyed watching this move - now twice.  Very little filthy language and no inappropriate sexual situations.  There is a lot of scary scenes which will probably be too much for younger children.  I think the actors did a great job and I loved the funny parts as well.,1377734400,,281,4.470588235294118
4576177,1,B0055EAJ7A,Even Natalie Portman couldn't save this dog.  Absolute bilge.  Waste of time and money if you bought a ticket. Not recommended for anyone over 5 years old.,1377561600,,155,4.703703703703703
4576178,5,B0055EAJ7A,This is the third time I watched Thor.  First time was at a drive -in with the family.  The latest was with the family before two headed off to college.,1377561600,,152,4.033333333333333

4576180,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Probably our favorite of the new genre of comic book action movies. A little less action than some of the other movies, but much smarter, funnier, and delivers the less known backstory of Thor in an informative and interesting way.

I just learned that Kenneth Branagh directed it, which accounts for the uptick in quality over other comic book themed movies.",1377561600,,359,4.885245901639344

4576182,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I never really got into Thor comic books but I think they portrayed him pretty well with this movie. It had great visual effects and the storyline was pretty good. Of course I like everyone else has their own opinion and believe that  they could have improved on movie storyline but overall I liked the one Hollywood went with. If I could give 4-1/2 stars outta five I would have falling short of the ""love it"" top mark",1377475200,,419,4.371794871794871

4576190,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Not a terrible movie, but not the best superhero movie I've seen either. It may just be that I'm not into the superhero genre, but still, wouldn't rewatch it any time soon.",1377388800,,172,4.40625

4576193,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Was wondering how they would script the ""domain of the Gods"" relationship with our world, and they pulled it off with credible concepts and notions of our laws of physics and our understanding of our place in the universe.

4576197,3,B0055EAJ7A,"This is a good movie to pass the time, the action and plot were pretty ok/good, but the way they portrayed the romance was cheesy and unrealistic.

4576198,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Generally, I like the comic book genre of movies. For some reason, I wasn't really that into Thor, but decided I better watch it before seeing the Avengers. I wasn't disappointed. Enough action and story here to entertain.",1377216000,,222,4.868421052631579
4576199,4,B0055EAJ7A,This was a pretty good movie. Wasn't what I thought it would be. I would recommend it to every one.,1377129600,,99,4.0
4576200,4,B0055EAJ7A,"It's the cast, and most notably Chris Hemsworth, that makes this a movie worth watching. The scenes in Asgard are great, the ones on earth are comparatively a bit dull. More weight is given to the love story than is warranted. However all that is easy to forgive with commanding performances so much of the cast!",1377129600,,312,4.589285714285714
4576201,5,B0055EAJ7A,Very entertaining. Hot cast. Fun plot. Better than I expected. Now I want to see the 2nd Thor movie. Set before Avengers' timeline.,1377129600,,131,4.739130434782608

4576204,3,B0055EAJ7A,The best re-creation of Thor the comic book yet. The acting was decent but the action was fantastic. The director did a good job.,1377043200,,129,4.416666666666667
4576205,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Kenneth Branagh, as director, did a fantastic job with this film! The pacing was perfect, and, rather than just a smash-em-up action flick, this one actually had a bit more of a substantial narrative thrust. Think father-son-brother relations and the maturation of the protagonist all blown to epic scale in the guise of Norse legend. The only weak characters (and lackluster acting) in this film were Thor's 3 loyal friends who get few lines and some (in my view) awkward appearances. Well worth watching more than once.",1377043200,,521,5.0
4576206,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Entertaining plot.  Not too much over-the-top graphics. My wife liked it too and she is more of an ""Emma"" fan.",1377043200,,110,4.5

4576208,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Good plot, very in depth building story background at the expense of action scenes.  While I employed the movie overall, I thought it was as much to set up the sequel as to stand on its own.  Good cast and special effects.",1377043200,,222,4.261904761904762

4576210,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I enjoyed this movie and I watched it completely.  It's no Lord of the Rings but is consistently entertaining.  The key figure in the movie is Thor (or course) who is marked to be the next king of his nation but his warrior mentality leads him to almost start a war with another nation which his father has worked hard to avoid.  Banished from his kingdom, he grows and learns from his mistakes and eventually regains his father's confidence while exposing his brother duplicity.  This is a good movie for a sequel.",1376956800,,515,4.565217391304348
4576211,5,B0055EAJ7A,"If you've watched other Marvel movies you know what you are in for, this film is meant to be exciting, silly, suspenseful, and dynamic. I love the mix of technology with simplistic scenes.

Easy move to watch, immerses you, takes you away from whatever else you're focusing on.",1376956800,,277,4.770833333333333
4576212,4,B0055EAJ7A,Great effects and decent acting. Good storyline to show Thor's humility story and how he falls for humanity. Pretty integral story that contributes to the Avengers movie plot.,1376956800,,175,5.285714285714286

4576215,5,B0055EAJ7A,This DVD didn't come with any special features but the movie itself is worth buying for not only the plot but the actors. They are too pretty to say no to.,1376956800,,155,4.032258064516129

4576218,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Action! Adventure! Aliens! Beautiful (rawrr!) women! And a pretty damn cool story! Thank goodness Marvel got movie rights and their own studio to do their (Stan's!) properties the way they shoulda been done the first time around (i.e. the ones they didn't do exclusively the first go round). Hemsworth is a fine God of Thunder. I know we as movie audiences take the special effects for granted these days. We (I'm guilty too) enter the theater at the latest sci-fi/fantasy/sci-fi fantasy, or whatever, blockbuster, sit down and more or less say ""K, I'm here. Let's see you wow me."" Looked pretty good to me. Asgaard, as well as its surrounding environs looked incredible, the colors, sparklies and textures gorgeous. The god costumes were breath taking (damn, Heimdahl was near hypnotic).  They were obviously Nordic, but there was that Marvel jolt of sci-fi/fantasy too. The Jotun side was nasty and beastly looking, so were they! Natalie Portman was, of course, delicious, strong, and vulnerable in just the right amounts. And takes Jane in a new direction as a top scientist. The entire cast was really spot on and I really enjoyed all the portrayals. Just didn't get to see enough Kat Dennings!",1376870400,,1198,4.960199004975125

4576262,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I watched this movie to get the backstory on The Avengers, so it was good in that respect.  Otherwise it was fairly stilted. But what else should you expect from a movie that casts Natalie Portman as an astrophysicist.",1375488000,,218,4.589743589743589

4576267,5,B0055EAJ7A,I watched this in the 3D version and the 2D version and loved both of them. The 3D is by far the best as the colors and graphics are so vibrant and it looks like you can reach out and touch someone. Lots of action and can't wait for the second one to come out.,1375401600,,260,3.7454545454545456
4576268,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Now thnis was a dvd worth its weight in gold,Chris  Heimworth was awesome,Anthony Hopkins surper as usual,the theme of the being of Thor was well written each character had its own identity and brought the story line together. BRAVO, BRAVO,BRAVO",1375315200,,245,5.125

4576280,5,B0055EAJ7A,This is a movie that fathers should add to their personal list to sit down with their boys in time of anger and hate or lack of communication,1375056000,,141,4.071428571428571
4576281,4,B0055EAJ7A,This movie was as fast of a pace movie as it could be from the beginning. The pace kept right on up to the very end.,1375056000,,116,3.5

4576285,5,B0055EAJ7A,This is an action packed movie that was really fun to watch. It is a must have to go along with Iron Man & The Avengers movies.,1374969600,,127,3.740740740740741
4576286,3,B0055EAJ7A,Travel viewing so I was not fully engaged. I did like it for what is was but I'm kind of a harsh critic,1374969600,,103,3.5217391304347827
4576287,4,B0055EAJ7A,This movie was great. I usually don't like movies involving marvel characters but this one was really great. I'm definitely going to see the second one in theaters when it comes out.,1374883200,,182,4.71875

4576291,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Takes a character from Marvel who I didn't particularly like and makes an enjoyable story around him. It leaves enough unanswered questions to have me interested in a sequel, if one is made. definitely sets up interest for Avengers movies to come.",1374710400,,247,4.904761904761905
4576292,4,B0055EAJ7A,Great action adventure in the great tradition of Marvel comics. Traditional Norse mythology with modern special effects and a story that works.,1374710400,,143,5.545454545454546

4576294,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I watched it when it came out originally and didn't care for it. I watched the Avengers and then rewatched this on Amazon. I really liked it the second time and understood it much better. I never followed the Thor comic book, so the story was brand new. After the second viewing, I changed my opinion.",1374710400,,301,4.392857142857143
4576295,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I love the super hero movies and this was very well done. Good story line and great action. A bit slow at times, but helped to move the story along.",1374710400,,148,3.966666666666667
4576296,4,B0055EAJ7A,"If you ever wondered how Thor arrived to super heroism, this movie is for you. This movie brought the human element into play in a very entertaining fashion. The evolution of Thor was very captavating as he was grey from a mere mortal to a super hero. The human element of innonce regarding our realm was classic.

I do recommend that others watch this movie.",1374710400,,359,4.523076923076923

4576299,2,B0055EAJ7A,This movie was mediocre at best.  It was sometimes a bit corny  Guess it was made for a younger audience,1374624000,,104,4.15
4576300,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor was the only character that I was not familiar with from the Avengers so I decided to check it out. If you are one of the few people who hasn't seen the avengers yet, watch this one first. Great movie.",1374624000,,206,4.048780487804878

4576302,4,B0055EAJ7A,Loved all the characters in this movie.  Can't wait until the sequel!!!  Hoping he can eventually get back to Earth!!!,1374624000,,118,4.85
4576303,5,B0055EAJ7A,Thor is a great movie especially in 3D.  New technology allows us to see 3D at home exactly the same as in the theater.  I have Iron Man and the Avengers but didn't know about Thor which appears in the Avengers.  We enjoyed seeing the background of why Thor was on Earth.  If you watch the Avengers but haven't watched Thor I highly recommend that you do.,1374624000,,355,4.253731343283582
4576304,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Not a bad movie for just no sense watching.  Tells the story about Thor to some degree and help explain some history when watching the Avengers.  If you have nothing to do and need some kid like entertainment, not bad.",1374537600,,218,4.425

4576311,5,B0055EAJ7A,This movie is possibly my favorite Phase 1 Marvel film. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. You won't be disappointed.,1374451200,,121,4.809523809523809
4576312,5,B0055EAJ7A,be prepared for a wild ride! with some very sexy characters! it has great acting and a great story line!,1374364800,,104,4.25
4576313,1,B0055EAJ7A,"I only managed to watch 20 minutes before I got tired of the nonsense.

4576314,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Looking at Thor  both from present-day time and his existence in the ""past,""  creates a situation where Thor must recognize and accept/understand his dual existence.",1374278400,,165,5.56
4576315,5,B0055EAJ7A,"OK, I know the Avenger's Universe. I know that the creators of the film version of ""Thor"" messed with Origins and a lot of the backstory. BUt, c'mon! This is still one fun romp! Not a whole lot of story development, and the best dialogue comes from Loki (which is good, I'm not sure movie Thor, who is all grunt, should be allowed to speak). Don't judge the movie by what Thor Universe is supposed to be, but just take the film for what it is...Thor is reallllly good at fighting, and then he can't, so lost Thor must find his soul. Ta da!",1374278400,,539,4.1923076923076925

4576317,5,B0055EAJ7A,I love comic book adventures brought alive to the big screen.  I really like the way they presented the Thor movie.  They really did a great job.  Lots of action and some great humor.,1374192000,,183,4.323529411764706
4576318,5,B0055EAJ7A,"When I finally got the chance to watch all the Marvel movies together, of the ones that have come out lately, I expected Thor to be the weakest of the entries in the series.  I was very pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways.  When it comes to this Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital Copy, it has to be said that the quality of an HD viewing really is your best bet.  There are a lot of visual effects including entire digitally-created sets that are highly detailed, fantastic, and gorgeous in high definition.

The movie itself has moments of pure fantasy that remind me of a Final Fantasy game, with scenes of action worthy of any good superhero film, plus large-scale battle sequences reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films.  We have a storyline similar to the '80s movie (and TV show) Starman, and the acting is top-notch.  (Sir!) Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job of portraying a father torn by the pain of seeing his sons in turmoil, unable to learn the lessons that will bring them into adulthood.  Chris Hemsworth captures the angry-young-man impulsiveness and yet still shows such compassion and chivalry that any fan of romance will truly enjoy the love story--and he is definitely as physically fit as a god.  The only real drawback to the acting is that Natalie Portman has to struggle to be relevant in the midst of so many different story elements (though I do believe she is a great actress).  It's especially entertaining to see Tom Hiddleston  (as Loki) mischeviously steal nearly every scene he's in.

While I'm not steeped in Thor's mythos, I have to give credit to the story's writers for taking the Arthur C. Clarke approach to depicting the world of Asgard:  they simply appear to be so very technologically advanced from our society that their technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Part of the fun in this particular movie is its connection to the other Marvel films:  with Iron Man 1 & 2, the Hulk films and Captain America, 'Thor' sets the stage for The Avengers:  it has pieces of the storyline from the other movies dropped into the main story in a very interesting way.

If you've seen one or more of the Marvel superhero films that tie into The Avengers, see 'em all.  I don't buy many movies these days, but Thor is definitely a Blu-Ray worth owning.  It is not my favorite film in the series, but it is definitely far better than I expected it to be.",1374105600,,2389,4.607565011820331
4576319,5,B0055EAJ7A,"As Grandparents, were pleasantly surprised at the quality entertainment of this film. Grandson kept hinting at this movie, so we jumped in..he also suggested Amazon Prime for which we are happy that we subscribed.",1374105600,,213,5.294117647058823
4576320,4,B0055EAJ7A,Initial connection and audio were not good. But in time both improved and I was able to watch the movie from start to finish.,1374019200,,125,4.25
4576321,4,B0055EAJ7A,It's somewhat predictable as far as the overall plot like all DC comic based characters are but the actors involved just did a great job making it a very entertaining movie,1374019200,,172,4.580645161290323

4576324,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I loved this movie.  As far as Marvel Comics are concerned, Thor has always been my favorite.  I did not really know how they would handle the fantastical, God-like stuff in the story, but they did an incredible job.  The acting is wonderful, the music is regal but not overdone, and Kenneth Branagh proves himself as a director here.  I hope the sequel delivers as well.",1373932800,,371,4.575757575757576

Nothing happened between them. She found him in the desert then bailed him out of jail, that was all it took evidently.

4576377,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I don't know a thing about Norse mythology or the Marvel comics featuring Thor.  I had to accept this movie on its own terms as a live action comic book that couldn't decide if it was meant to be funny or to be taken seriously.  It literally starts in the dark and stays there far longer than it should, even when one of the characters teases, ""wait for it.............""  I did.  What followed was a little fancy in the sky, a dust tornado, and the thud of Thor almost becoming road kill.  A bit of history was imparted in a grandiose manner.  Lots of CGI was employed (it seems these days that action films are becoming more animated than live action).  The plot involves two brothers born to be kings, but there can be only one!  One is arrogant (Thor), the other is just plain sneaky (Loki).  What follows is insubordination, insurrection, and expulsion to the planet Earth (the all-purpose penal colony for superheroes).  There's even a comparison to be had with The Sword in the Stone (who is worthy to wield the hammer of Thor!?).  Many pull but only one can master it.
As far as action packed superhero flicks go, this one does what it's supposed to (which is neither faint praise nor vain glory).  No one really stood out.  The villain of the piece, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was a bit wishy-washy.  Anthony Hopkins opted out for a snooze.  I didn't even realize Rene Russo (Odin's wife) was even in this film!

It was entertaining.  I did like it.  But I expected more than just a little razzle-dazzle.  If they come out with a Thor 2 I'd see it and hope for the best (because this certainly wasn't).",1372809600,,1605,4.472413793103448

4576379,5,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR (2011). Rated PG-13. Running time: One hour, 54 mins.
Directed by Kenneth Branaugh. Written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne. Story J. Michael Straczynski, Mark Protosevich.
The story of this movie begins after Iron Man 2 (2010).

 In Puente Antiguo, New Mexico, Jane (Natalie Portman) has brought Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) to this exact spot somewhere in the desert because according to her calculations, a very special aurora is going to occur. It does happen and they decide to drive closer to it. A tornado forms. Suddenly they hit a man. Who is he and what is he doing in the middle of no where.

 We are then treated to the story of Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) on his Day of Triumph, how he fought and had his power and hammer taken from him. He is banished to Earth.

It is Jane who found Thor. After some medical attention in the hospital and some food in the cafe, Thor is now in search for his powerful hammer that only he can lift from the crater, but now his powers are gone. All he has is his strength.

Also in the cast: Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Colm Feore, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, Stan Lee, Jeremy Renner, Douglas Tait, Samuel L. Jackson.

4576380,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I liked the movie but there were more Earthlings shown than Asgardians. I think that more of the folks that live IN Asgard should have been in the movie. Really boring when all you get to see is Odin, his wife, Loki, Thor, Thor's buddies, the guardian and only when there is a ceremony do you see anyone else from Asgard. Were the rest of them? Dead and buried?

Also would have liked to have seen Nick Fury's character in the movie. Good to see Agent Coulson but Fury would have been interesting alongside Thor.

You got to see more Stone Giants than Asgardians.

For all of its faults, Dune was a better story set in a science fiction/fantasy world. There was great character development.

Most of the comic book world seems to be dwelling on punch more than story. Frankly I would have paid to see a second movie had they developed the Asgardian culture more.

All of the characters were well played - the Viking/Norse style of civilization on Asgard could use a few ""longboats"" to liven it up. While the CGI sets were stunning it all starts to look like another video game in space after awhile.

As a standalone movie separate from comic comparisons, I found this to be a typical Marvel film. Lots of action, comedic relief, dramatic arc, and more action.

They did an awesome job with this movie and I can continue to watch it multiple times or start anywhere in the movie.  I find something different every time I see it and the beginning with the History in Norway and how Loki became Odin's son is perfect.",1371772800,,368,4.097222222222222

4576421,4,B0055EAJ7A,I found 'Thor' to be an entertaining movie with a good story line and plenty of action.  I am a fan of Norse mythology so I did raise an eyebrow a few times with some of the liberties taken with said mythology but even so I did enjoy the movie.  It certainly lacked a lot of vivid and gratuitous violence and I also enjoyed the relative dearth of foul language.,1371427200,,361,4.142857142857143

4576436,3,B0055EAJ7A,"The movie is okay, I guess it was intended for a younger comic book audience.  I think all the creative parts came from the comic book story; cardboard characters.  I think this was meant to be an exercise in special effects and action.  There were opportunities for more depth that were missed, for example in the relationship between Thor and his father.  The actors were good, I just don't think the script and dialog was quite up to snuff.",1370908800,,443,4.569620253164557

4576442,3,B0055EAJ7A,It was an ok flm in that I did watch it to the end. I am sure it would be good for youngsters but mature adults would find it just acceptable for entertainment,1370736000,,159,3.8484848484848486

4576446,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I'm a fan of some Marvel characters but I don't like all of the new movies and reboots so I initially skipped watching Thor until now. I came in with low expectations but it turned out to be a very solid movie. It had a good balance of acting ""serious"" but still giving some comedic moments that felt natural and not forced. Considering the material it could have come off cheesy and awkward but for the most part it all came together very well. If you're actually reading reviews to decide if you're going to watch this, go ahead and give it a view. You may end up surprised like me.",1370736000,,584,4.27027027027027

4576452,3,B0055EAJ7A,I really liked this as a comic book movie. The backstory of Asgaard and Thor isn't well known so all the space scenes were necessary. The BBEG wasn't too evil and they took him down rather unexcitingly but I can't wait for the next one.,1370563200,,236,4.266666666666667

4576471,3,B0055EAJ7A,"To follow the story, it is very helpful to read Wikipedia beforehand. Much vocabulary, many character backstories, and preceding history is presumed by the story. The film would have been stronger with greater depth and focus on a smaller number or characters and sub-plots. It was too crowded and confusing. The romance had zero chemistry and the Natalie Portman character, Jane was portrayed less like the graduate student she was supposed to be and more like a schoolgirl pursuing her first crush.",1370044800,,500,5.109756097560975

The Ice Giants, the sole antagonists, are more than worthy of a backstory that would've fueled a much more compelling plot.

I admired this from the very beginning.  Brannagh is of course a very talented man;  he and his casting director chose the actors very well.  One gets the sense that Loki is not ""a good guy"" right from the beginning - and also it's pertinent to note I had not read any ""Viking lore"" since I was a young girl ... found in a child's book of legends, then searched for later in myths and mythologies.

All in all this was beautifully presented, well acted, fun and entertaining.  I surprised myself!

I would love to see ""the Gatekeeper"" in other films; his was a weighty responsibility.

The characters are wonderful, a great story and we learn so much from Thor as he learns from us 'Humans'.
Solid sense of humanity, fun, pure comic book theme, loved learning about Thor before the Marvel's Avengers came out.

I know purist will have a hard time with Dr. Donald Blake not being anymore than a name and nothing to do with the God of Thunder here, but with the way this film ended, I can see an interesting way to introduce him as he should be.

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

Now that the bridge from Asgard to Earth has been destroyed, maybe the only way for Thor to return to earth is to project his being into a earthling who is worthy? and that someone will need a a certain item to conjure up the Norse God.(a staff maybe?) It would be nice if they could introduce Blake as Thor's alter ego to add some dimension to the role and give ""old goldilocks"" a breather.

******END OF SPOILER******

Now on to the film, it works! Mainly because the three H's (main actors) are exceptional in their roles. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins are completely committed to their roles and they pull off what could have been a disaster. Portman is also very good, but I didn't feel she was irreplaceable, though quite nice to look at, she isn't given as much to do as she could have been if Thor's alter ego was involved.

The action scenes are big and believable as well as Asgard's design. The action is a little too sparse for my taste, but Thor's Mjolnir his impressive weapon of choice is pretty great, seeing some of its signature uses i.e. the helicopter spinning hammer, conjuring lightning etc.

Hemsworth seems born for the role and followed through in The Avengers movie.. I can't wait for Thor's sequel to hit theaters.
Thor isn't perfect, but it is everything it needs to be and more. It is one of the most entertaining comic book films of all time. I saw this at IMAX in 3-D and it looked great, I'm not completely sold on 3-D, but it has improved a great deal.

4576574,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I like this movie. It has action, some humor, and a bit of a ""feel good"" nature. However, the film feels like it still needs some refinement; particularly in its plot.

[Not sure if this counts as SPOILERS, but be warned nonetheless] While the pacing is good, once you're done, it feels as though the movie progressed to quickly through its content. This is probably because the film's plot centers around Thor needing to learn a lesson. Once he finally changes for the better, he quickly saves the world and everyone goes home happy. Then the movie ends.

The film spends about 90% of its time with Thor ""becoming a better man"" and about 10% on him as an actual hero. Once I finally get to appreciate this character, the movie ends. It's a feeling that seriously left me wanting more.

But as I said before, it's a thoroughly enjoyable film. His progression from arrogant, spoiled royalty to honorable hero, is entertaining. It provides much of the ""feel good"" of the film. I just wish that there was more ""hero"" in it as well.

Perhaps a mini-series would have been a better format for Thor.",1367366400,,1093,4.589743589743589

Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo as his wife, were excellent.

And Stellan Skarsgard steals every scene he is in unless Kat Dennings is in it.  Those two were a hoot.  The sets were gorgeous and most of the acting was very good.",1367107200,,554,4.5353535353535355

The main characters are neither all good nor all bad in the tradition of the Greeks and this renders them sympathetic and heroic at the same time. The relatonship between Thor and his father captures the essence of today's troubled families and is one of the few movies to break out of the old cliche of the younger son emerging victorious in the end. I reccomend the movie to old and young alike and urge families to watch it together for its entertainment value and also what it adds to the conversation about the challenges facing families today.",1366848000,,648,4.692982456140351

4576602,5,B0055EAJ7A,"While the setting of Asgard was a bit over the top perhaps, the story was good and in some places even funny. Odin is about to name the next king of Asgard, grooming both Thor and Loki to princely duties, but Loki's little prank goes awry when the Frost giants raid the treasury to try to retake the Casket of Winters. They are destroyed, and Odin is willing to dismiss it, but Thor is not, and leads a raid to Jotunheim to seek revenge, against his father's wishes. It is through Odin's intersession that the battle ends, but not amiably as King Laufy chooses to declare war on Asgard. It is in this battle that Loki learns his true heritage, that he is the son of King Laufy, discarded by Laufy, found by Odin and raised in Asgard.  . Because Thor in his arrogance, disobeyed him, he stripped him of his power and cast him from Asgard, until either he, or someone else can prove worthy to use Mjolnir,the magic hammer. Loki, in the meantime, demands to know more about how he came to be, and because Odin did not choose him to be the king, and Laufy discarded him,decides to take vengeance on both Laufey and Odin when Odin takes ill and falls into an enchanted sleep. Since Odin is asleep, Loki assumes the throne and leads the way for Laufey so that he may at last kill Odin while he is helpless. Thor on the other hand has problems of his own. Slamming into Midgard from above, he is anything but subtle. Taken to a hospital, he proves to be anything but the ideal patient and it is only through Jane Foster and her father that he manages to settle down so that he can try to find his hammer. He finds it, but so have others and SHIELD has surrounded it and taken all the scientific handiwork that Jane and her father had. It is when he fails to lift his hammer does he realize the truth. He must prove himself worthy once again or he will remain forever earthbound. This particular Thor is part of the Marvel Comics universe, but it is an interesting story in its own right and a fun romp through Marvel's version of Norse Mythology.",1366502400,,2039,4.323759791122716
4576603,4,B0055EAJ7A,"With a more than solid cast, led by Anthony Hopkins and Chris Hemsworth, and a fantastic director in Kenneth Branagh, this movie was pretty darn awesome. The look of Asgard is grand and epic and really looks like a cross between magic & technology. The costumes were really well done as well, they looked functional, well being otherworldy. The action was pretty brutal and kick ass, seeing Thor wielding Mjolnir, his hammer, and just hurling it at the enemy is great. The action over all was pretty well done, although sometimes it was a bit to chaotic. The story did feel a bit rushed in parts, and the romance aspect was a bit limp, but considering how much had to be introduced and explained about the Asgardians, they did a good job. Can't wait to see where they go with the sequel.",1366502400,,787,4.549295774647887

The characters help me teach my boys good life lessons and give me larger than life examples of some values we'd like them to emulate, like loyalty, humility after failing, the pitfalls of pride, and the strength it takes to get back on one's feet.  There is a good bit of fighting, which we try to limit our kids' access to, but on the whole of it, the fighting scenes are pretty tame with none of the blood and gore present in many other films.",1364860800,,522,4.158415841584159

Hiddleton is nasty as Loki( also seen just as nasty in the Avengers) the guy who plays the gate (Byfrost)keeper, steals the show a couple times, with such a high powered cast and director, seems necessary and well done.",1364515200,,369,4.951612903225806

The warrior Thor (Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Hopkins) for his arrogance and sent to Earth to live among humans. Falling in love with scientist Jane Foster (Portman) teaches Thor much-needed lessons, and his new-found strength comes into play as a villain, (Thor's step brother) from his homeland sends dark forces towards Earth to destroy him and take over his fathers place and become the new king/leader of Asgard.",1364515200,,666,4.6440677966101696

 Go elsewhere. This tale is based a comic book and the movie is more like one than you might expect. The visuals are sumptuous (Asgard in particular) but the characters don't have real depth. The action sequences are also excellent but once again, seem two-dimensional.

I'm not a huge fan of Marvel Comic remakes or Video Game Adaptions so already, I went in with high expectations that I knew were not going to be met. This was not as bad as some movies, such as Mortal Kombat, House of the Dead, or In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. But it just didn't capture the magic I would have liked to see in a film like this. Am I a tough critic? Sure. But I am the one buying the tickets. I have the right to be.

Natalie Portman is great in whatever she is in, though nothing tops her Star Wars roles. Hemsworth was more memorable in this one for me though. Nat's character seemed a bit like a cliche girl in trouble who was only there to stand in the background and shudder whenever things got hairy.

Throw in Samuel L.

Since it released on prime, I've watched it more than a couple of times and it just gets better with each viewing.

4576742,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I'm one of those kids that read the original Thor comic book in the sixties by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. I was a little bit afraid that my own experience with the original might make it difficult for me to like the film adaption.  However, I actually did enjoy this film. I think Kenneth Branagh did a good job overall in this adaption, not a fantastic job mind you, but a good job. The movie does feel like a real honest-to-goodness Thor movie.

I wasn't sure what Asgard might look like in the live film compared to Kirby's cosmic splendors of the kingdom, but I did like the design and effects for the city of Asgard, so it worked for me.  Btw, I also really loved the costumes. As for the script, I liked it although Odin's last remarks weren't anything that was illuminating or surprising.

On the actresses and actors:  some of the quality of acting isn't up to what it should be.  However, I really enjoyed Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki and thought they were both good choices for their parts.  I was also delighted to see the Warriors Three in the film. However, I wasn't as happy about the lack of content and development for their characters: Hogan (Tadanobu Asano) really has  nothing to say or talk about, Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) is not quite as weighty and as buffoonish as the rolling comic mass from the comic books (but that's okay), and Fandral (Joshua Dallas) doesn't have enough time or witty dialogue to bring forth his genuine swashbuckling mirth. The selection of those three, however, still made me happy that these characters were in the film and wish there were more time spent developing/deepening their personalities. I really liked Jaimie Alexander's Sif (hubba-hubba), but again we hardly get a chance to spend much time with them.

Odin (Anthony Hopkins) voice seemed too soft and mild for me.  I always imagined Odin with a more bombastic or booming voice.  Ah well.

Natalie Portman wasn't very interesting as Jane Foster -- but, as I recall it, Jane Foster in the comic book wasn't very interesting either.  The other actor (Stellan Skarsgrd) and actress (Kat Dennings) seem to be in it only for the ride, and so they had very little drama or content to grasp in order to act out anything interesting in any manner or form.

I gave the film three-out-of-five stars. I'm hoping in the next Thor movie we'll see more content and development from the side characters and not just only the leads",1362960000,13,2446,4.631944444444445

Thor is brought to life in a way that seemed to be undoable prior to its completeion.  The Thor we meet and travel with seems very believable probably because of the writing and direction that makes Thor's actions very believable from a human perspective.

By the time the movie ends, Thor seems much less implausible and the viewer is practically drooling to see the Avengers.  The first glimpse of another Avenger in this movie also makes it a must see for the Avengers fan.",1362528000,2,667,4.6752136752136755

The main thing that I liked about the movie is that it had great actors in it who did a wonderful job and it told a great story of how one should be.

Both of my boys are getting to that age where they can watch these movies and are liking them.  Clean and not too many cussing like some movies that are just not kid friendly.

Natalie is pretty as always, but this is no Black Swan. The SFX are fine (a bit over the top), but unless you're a Marvel Comics fan, don't expect to hear an Academy Award screenplay or see top notch acting.

4576811,3,B0055EAJ7A,"It is a movie based on a comic book, and done in a bland way. No great acting here, no sit on the edge of your seat thrills. Just a mindless romp through the history of Marvel's Thor character. There were attempts at playfulness, but they fell flat. The movie had some nice special effects, but even they were somewhat juvenile by today's standards. Although streaming it for free as a Prime Member was not a complete let down, had I paid money to see it I would have been disappointed. On the other hand, children around the ages of 7 to 10 years old might really like this movie.",1361836800,,581,4.290909090909091

4576813,3,B0055EAJ7A,"It was an OK movie, not as good as Iron Man I or II or as good as The Avengers (best movie in the series).  It was a little cheesy and the story was very jumpy.  Every other scene was a different world.  It was easy to follow but didn't allow for much continuity.  Anyhow, it was watching it on Prime for free from my couch.  I would have been disappointed in the theater but good pick at home.  \\",1361836800,,398,3.9125

4576817,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is a great super hero movie. Though it's certainly just a piece of the puzzle building up to the Avengers film,it really stands on it's own and that's a great thing if you're expecting a lot out of it's 3D version.

The opening menu looks spectacular in 3D and really amps up your expectations for the whole film to come. Sadly,the film offers less 3D depth than I expected and theirs really no pop out factor to speak of. The best way I can describe the 3D look of this film is bubbly. That probably makes very little sense but if you watch it you'll know what I mean. It doesn't look terrible in it's 3D presentation but it's nothing to gawk over either.

If you're looking for a great 3D super hero film I say go for the Avengers. It's only a few dollars more than Thor (3D versions). Shoot their are plenty of 3D films much cheaper that look better in 3D.
I only recommend Thor (3D version) to the hardcore fanbase,or for those who collect 3D movies and just want to watch everything in 3D (like myself).For everyone else the standard bluray or DVD version will be satisfying enough. It's a great,entertaining movie,with subpar 3D.",1361664000,,1140,4.44976076555024

4576826,3,B0055EAJ7A,"The great and powerful Thor was one of the biggest grossing movies of 2011. The special effects in this film were really some of the best I've ever seen and the star of the film, Chris Hemsworth was amazing, but besides that, this film was extremely overrated. Thor is banished to Earth for disobeying his father, the King, and must live as a mortal. Surprisingly, it doesn't take him very long to adjust, and he falls in love with Natalie Portman during a fifteen minute car ride. Okay, so the plot was weak to begin with, but the special effects could have more than made up for that. What I really didn't like about this film was just how fast everything happened. Thor is going to be in the Avengers trilogy and there is a good possibility there may be a sequel to this film, so what was the point in rushing everything? The character of Thor is a majestic one. He is one of the most powerful superheroes that ever existed. This film should have been the epic classic that was talked about for years, but instead they rushed the story and hid behind some great special effects. It was visually impactful, entertaining, and had a great star, but a side from that, this film is nothing more than a common theme with a weak script.",1361491200,,1232,4.431718061674009

4576840,1,B0055EAJ7A,Thor follows the same guideline as most comic superhero movies: it tries to tell the origin of the hero and it forgets to get a good plot for the story. There are plenty of good comics with excellent plots out there. Why not make a movie out of a good story? Isn't that what they choose to put books in the big screen?,1361318400,2,318,4.063492063492063
4576841,5,B0055EAJ7A,Unlike SO MANY movies that try to re-write the past of characters from Lore this one simply sticks to it.  Rather than going back and re-telling Thor's history from a modern angle they simply decided to go with what has been written for many ages and embrace it.  They then move forward with the story from the current date.  If you've read the comic book series you will realized that they combined many story lines into this one and left others out.  They will be used in the second movie.  We meet Thor and see that he is arrogant as he was in the beginning of lore and the beginning of the comic book series.  Then we get to see him as he makes his human friends that will be needed later in the subsequent movies/story lines.  Then we get to see him get his abilities back and lose some of his arrogance.  In the end it was another great movie in the Avengers story line and worth a watch.,1361232000,,894,4.2176470588235295
4576842,3,B0055EAJ7A,Anything with Anthony Hopkins in it makes me want to check it out. This movie was good. I liked the character developments and the overall character arcs - specifically how Thor takes up his mantel and how Loki decides upon his.,1361232000,,228,4.585365853658536

The actor playing Thor is delightful. Natalie Portman is adorable. The bad guy is sinister and conflicted and tortured (wo is me!) and the actor pulls it off just right. And hello, Sir Anthony Hopkins? You've got this brilliant, accomplished actor playing Thor's dad? Awesome. The big showy sci fi effects are fun. I have no idea how loyal it is to the Marvel universe, nor do I care.

There is a reason why he wasn't and that was the lack of excitement.  This movie does draw lines to the Avenger's like any good comic they want you to buy more because of the tie ins.  Like most movies in the genre it is great to turn it on, turn off the brain, and relax with something that doesn't require too much thinking.

4576872,3,B0055EAJ7A,"If movie is free to watch ok, I wouldnt pay for watching this movie. There could have use more action and drama.",1360540800,,112,4.136363636363637

4576875,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is hot, but that's not the only reason I love the movie. It's my favorite of the Avengers movies. I like the Norse mythology angle because I'm a geek and, aside from that, I like the cast of this movie a lot. They do a great job, and they all have a good on-screen chemistry with one another.",1360540800,,297,4.0508474576271185

4576877,3,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie has all of what you generally expect from a superhero movie, but nothing that makes it outstanding. It's ok for a time filler or if you have some popcorn left over from the previous movie. Natalie Portman is always cute, but if she's the reason you're watching, choose another NP movie and you'll be happier. She's a lot cuter in Honey. Not the fantasy, the movie. ;)

One thing this movie might be good for is if you want to know the origin of Thor, then this movie will provide that, if it's true to comic history. I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this movie sometime, but if there's another that you already have in mind that you'd like to see, see that one first.",1360454400,,691,4.3565891472868215

4576880,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I'm tired of evil (the Ice Men) characterized as (pick one) monsters or the Devil.

I'm tired of intergalactic travel (or whatever it was) portrayed with noisy roaring machinery and flashing lights.

Portrayal of purported government intervention was the same as every other sci-fi/fantasy portrayal of government intervention.

But it was still entertaining on an otherwise sleepless night.",1360454400,,391,5.706896551724138
4576881,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Should have been a much longer movie so that the changes in the lead characters could have been more believable. The plot is as old as the hills, and the overall acting was not the best. Still, the action scenes were very well done, and the visuals are striking. Great movie for a rainy weekend.",1360454400,,295,4.381818181818182

4576890,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I picked this movie because I liked the Marvel Avengers movie with all the super hero's in it. I liked Thor so I choose to view the stand alone movie and was surprised how very good it was. It was romantic, funny, had adventure, It was all around good entertainment. Try it for yourself if you have not already. It's a fun movie to watch.",1360454400,,338,4.2153846153846155
4576891,4,B0055EAJ7A,I liked it.  The interplay between two people each seeking the throne was interesting.  The education and redemption of Thor put a new slant on an old story.,1360454400,,157,4.571428571428571
4576892,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Good movie but lacking in the ""wow"" effects that I like in 3d effects.  Had some quality special effects with the fighting scenes.",1360454400,,130,4.6521739130434785

4576910,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor was a nice change of pace for the superhero movies, introducing a new character. The movie was a great start to the story of Thor, a visual masterpiece on Blu-Ray and Hemsworth delivers a perfect role.",1359504000,,206,4.594594594594595
4576911,5,B0055EAJ7A,What else can I say.......Natalie Portman is exceptional as always. Action packed and great CG. Excellent movie for any collection.,1359331200,,131,5.6

4576918,5,B0055EAJ7A,"My husband felt the movie was too predictable, but I absolutely loved it.  Chris Hemsworth makes a wonderful Thor, and I felt that the movie did exactly what it was supposed to do - introduce Thor as a character, showing his growth from a spoiled would-be king, and through his personal journey of self-discovery.  I loved the special effects, and the introduction of a possible love interest for him.  The movie also set up Thor to join in the movie, The Avengers.  We have all the movies that fed into The Avengers, and I think Thor was one of the better ones.  Great comedic moments, too - well done.",1358899200,,603,4.495412844036697
4576919,5,B0055EAJ7A,This movie is definately worth watching. It's a good buildup to the Avengers movie. Great performances by all of the actors.,1358812800,,124,4.9523809523809526

4576921,2,B0055EAJ7A,"FIRST OFF, I loved the movie. While purists will be in dismay with how Thor and Asgard are portrayed, how the story is interpreted for today's audience and incorporating Thor in a ""scientific"" way in order to put him in the modern Marvel movies I felt was creative. HOWEVER, THE BLURAY QUALITY leaves a LOT to be desired on the RENTAL READY version at least. There are NO visible scratches on my disc but three times the disc would skip, stop, and go bubbly all over the place. If I put the machine on SLOW forward I could at least see what parts I was missing, but no sound obviously. I don't know for certain if its a problem with my machine or with the disc--so if you haven't had any problems, let me know please and I can change the review. Thanks for reading.",1358726400,,765,4.2827586206896555
4576922,5,B0055EAJ7A,I did not see this movie when it was in the Theatre so I purchased the Blu-ray. This a great movie with a good plot and a lot of action. I would recommend this to anyone that likes action movies.,1358640000,,195,3.9
4576923,5,B0055EAJ7A,"In order to enjoy the comic-book genre, one must immerse oneself totally into the fantasy. One of the big issues I have with the Nolan take is just that. Comic-books ARE fantasy and must hold true. Marvel gets it! A great story begets a GREAT movie. THOR is a great example. Is it 'Lawrence of Arabia""? No, and it does not need to be. They are popcorn munchers. The effects have finally caught up to the genre and THOR nails this as well. The big mistake MARVEL/Disney, and for that matter WB/DC, are making is that the movies need to be two-parters, part one released in the summer and part two during the holidays. These movies can be long, but must be in two parts, ala the old serials from the 40's. I would have loved to seen ""The Avengers"" this way (and think of the movie they could make). So, if you are not into the comicbook fantasy, I would give this one a ride. Sit back and enjoy the story as well as the great CGI. Oh, do NOT view on a screen smaller than 42"". And try to see in Blu-Ray.",1358553600,,1001,4.164948453608248
4576924,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Hard to find movies without sex, language, or excess violence.  This is one of a handful of PG -13 movies I allow my kids to watch.",1358467200,,131,4.038461538461538
4576925,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Ok, probably one of the best casting decisions in a long time.  Wathcing him go from strong and cocky to strong and noble was really nice and a great touch.  Nice reflection of my childhood images of these other worlds and the gods that inhabit them.",1358380800,,250,4.413043478260869
4576926,5,B0055EAJ7A,Definitely a favorite in our home. We love anything to do with super heroes. I guess having a 5 year old boy at home contributes to that. Great movie. Always provides entertainment.,1358294400,,181,4.6875

4576930,5,B0055EAJ7A,I still can't believe how good this version of Thor is. The cheesiness of Thor is somehow transformed into a really entertaining story.,1358294400,,135,4.913043478260869

4576932,5,B0055EAJ7A,One of the best of the Marvel Avenger movies in the series.  Saw this movie on the big screen and loved it.  Probably watched movie at least 5 times.  Way to go Stan Lee and the team.,1358121600,,183,3.891891891891892

4576937,5,B0055EAJ7A,Love this movie.  One of the great super hero movies.  I enjoyed this from start to finish.  Easy to follow story line and has lot of re-play ability.,1358121600,,150,4.285714285714286

4576939,5,B0055EAJ7A,Of all the comic book movies that have released recently Thor is the best. The special effects are absolutely amazing and the story line solid. You should see this one. I highly recommend it.,1358035200,2,191,4.647058823529412

4576942,3,B0055EAJ7A,"How can so many brilliant people get together and make such a fiasco? I could only take about 20 minutes of the eye-popping special effects before I started shutting down. All I ask is for are some  real characters I can care about, a reasonably, lively creative script, and some kind of slightly original story. Maybe I shouldn't criticize because I did only do most of the exposition, but I could see pretty clearly where this baby was going: right down the drain on a multi-million dollar thrill ride. Not even masterful actors like Hopkins can save messes like these. Compare him in this to what he did to us in Silence of the Lambs. Well, there are movies, and then there are just films. Maybe Hollywood should declare a moratorium on special effects for a spell. You can throw all the perfume in the world on a pig, but he's still going to stink.",1357948800,,852,4.496774193548387

That is not to say that the movie, from a comics fan standpoint, does not suffer from some serious technical flaws.  For instance, Volstagg was not ""Vast"", only a little chubby.  Hogun was Asian (and not particularly ""Grim"").  And, Heimdall was African American.  I never realized the Norsemen were such an ethnically mixed group.  Thankfully we never saw ""Balder the Brave""...

However, casting Tom Hiddleston for Loki was truly inspired (and even moreso in ""The Avengers""!).  Perhaps they can get Jake Ryan of the University of Michigan Wolverines Football team for Thor in the sequel?  ;^)  Although, Chris Hemsworth did fine work.",1357516800,,777,4.953488372093023

The tripartite structure of the play; the ""othering"" of non-white, non-male characters; the good versus evil struggle; the obviousness of its ending. Verily, it's crammed with unexamined tropes of Hollywood. Why do gods always speak with a vaguely British accent? Why can there be just one female warrior? Why does the director shoot at women's faces to illustrate emotions that are being felt by the male leads around which all action centers? Because that's how it's done, that's why. Don't ask yourself why you've never heard this goofy mythology before. Ask yourself why any story, whether it's a classic or a dud, deserves such hackneyed treatment, and so expensively. CGI and pretty actors and sword fights on rainbow bridges through the cosmos, magic that is explained as science and looks just as awesome as what Arthur C. Clarke was talking about, don't come cheap.

Thor was a warrior also, but not yet a leader. He had grown arrogant - hungry not just for battle, but for war. He wrongly saw war as glorious. For his arrogance Thor was banished, stripped of his powers, and cut off from home. He had to survive as just a man. Not superhuman and not royalty. Throughout his exile he makes friends with ordinary people and falls for a brilliant woman. He accepts that he can't go home.

Thor's enemies from Asgard still try to kill him, even after he stops trying to return home. His old friends seek to save him, and almost get killed in the process. To save his friends(both old and new) and more importantly the woman he loves, Thor willing sacrifices himself. He was ready to die for them. In that sacrifice he became worthy of the power he'd been stripped of - the power to lead, protect, and vanquish.  He'd gained True Nobility - the Power of a King.

With his powers restored Thor went on to protect those he loved.  Earth and Asgard were under the protection of the Super-Human Warrior the Vikings had once worshiped as the God of Thunder.",1356912000,,1274,4.38135593220339

4577018,1,B0055EAJ7A,"Shiny, good cinematography, inept direction & writing, albeit racist version of the Norse religion.

Great special effects, but otherwise astonishing inept. Terrible writing, casting, knowledge of the basic Norse religion, basic geography, basic ethnicity of the Norsemen, or for that matter not even a basic knowledge of the comic books. The guy playing Thor is fine. Anthony Hopkins is overrated as usual. Humongous errors in logic and historical storyline. I guess the bottom line, is letting Hollywood make a movie about the Norsemen and their heroes is best left to the people actually from that country.

With regards to casting, aside for whether Anthony Hopkins is overrated or not, the casting for this movie was pretty racist. I mean c'mon, Asgard was about the Norse gods. Hello?! Norse Gods here?!  Casting the Norse god Heimdall (Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge) with an black-skinned actor is simply racism at it's worst. What's next? A remake of Braveheart, but we find out he was really Taiwanese? A remake of Zulu, but this time one of the tribesmen is a Eskimo? A biography of Muhammed Ali as played by Matt Damon? Certainly, much as in the 1930's there was the Hays code which regulated morality in movies, and today we are about the same with having the diversity regulations. But if you wanted diversity, just make the Earth characters whatever quota of diversity you want. Let me guess, in the remake of the Wizard of Oz, Toto this time is actually going to be a poodle.

Oh...now I recall, in the new remake of Bambi, Thumper wasn't tough enough for today's crowds per Hollywood. This time Thumper is going to be a tattooed, rip-muscled, butt-kicking, mixed martial arts-using wabbitt who puts down anyone who tries to pick on Bambi.

And what's all the nonsense about Odin wanting to make Thor King of Asgard? What? Odin is king of Asgard! It make absolutely no sense that there's some sort of chance for Thor to be king of Asgard, it's just ridiculous. Odin is king of the gods, hello? Is anybody writing this movie at home? Hello?  'Nuff said.

Ok, one more thing.  While Stellan Skarsgard was in this movie, he has a much better character as a local king in Beowulf & Grendel. Although personally, i think B & G would have been much better without the sea hag, and for that matter without Grendel as well.

4577025,5,B0055EAJ7A,"All the Marvel movies I've seen lately have really impressed me, but Thor definitely stands out among them. It's the perfect mix of myth and modern. I'm not a big comic book reader so I can't tell you whether or not it stays true to the comics, but I can tell you it's a great action film. The plot is exciting and the acting is great! There's humor and romance tied into the story line, so even people who don't normally go in for action films can enjoy it. It's well written, with a lot of quotable moments. The villain keeps you on your toes, and his motives are definitely believable. I made my family sit down and watch it with me, and they all loved it too. Definitely a movie worth adding to your collection!",1356220800,,715,4.264705882352941

After half of The Avengers going clear over my head, I decided I should probably watch Thor. I really liked it. The only thing I didn't love was there was a little too much attention given to Natalie Portman's character, who we now know makes no cameos in the Avengers.",1356220800,,437,4.407407407407407

4577044,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Entertaining film, more so when the plot develops in Asgard. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. I just wish he should had used the helmet during the action scenes. That would have been more cool. The scenes on earth with Natalie Portman kind of drag and slowed the pace of the film. Natalie Portman (a fine actress) tweeted her acting scenes and to me was unconvincing as this revamped scientist Jane Foster (why they couldn't make her a nurse like in the comicbooks? I am sure that female nurses in the audience would have appreciated that too). Despite my complaints, the film has more pros than cons. Loki is great and Anthony Hopkins as Odin did a wonderful job. can't wait for the sequel.",1355875200,,697,4.584

4577097,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Based on a comic book hero, and mythology, you know going in you aren't going to get Hamlet.  This movie delivers exactly what it should, entertainment.  There is a surprisingly good story and a good cast of actors to bring it to life.  The characters are well developed and given a point of view that is easy to follow.  There's balance between the supporting and lead characters that is refreshing.  Chris Hemsworth earned the hype he's being given in this movie.

 While banished from his homeworld and made human, the demi-god takes a journey from arrogant boy to humbled man and we get to take that journey with him.  There is plenty of CGI action, some tongue in cheek humor and even a bit of a love story.  I love movies that are just pure fun and entertaining, and this movie is just that.

4577109,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Spoilers

It was a comic book of a movie but pretty enjoyable. If anything there was too much action and not enough interaction. The motivations of many of the characters were never quite clear to me. Thor's change of character after spending, what, a day or two as human, was not believable, nor was his love for Jane. If they had left him mortal, say for a year or two, I might have bought it, but not such a brief time. But the action sequences mostly carry the picture as does the sound. It was all CGI but I can't make myself not like it, even though a bit of it annoyed me. Like the destruction of the Bifrst Bridge. If this is a society with such high technology that it seems like magic, they seemed to fallen into a decadent period because they cannot repair the technology their ancestors built. That is what comes of having kings.",1353715200,,841,4.322784810126582

4577112,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I'm a relative newcomer to Marvel movies, and the comic book media genre in general. I've always heard of all the different superheroes, both DC and Marvel, but none of them ever really appealed to me. When I was younger I would watch the old Superman cartoons from the 40s. They were okay, now they seem rather cheesy. I've still never read an actual comic book. I'm nowhere near being an expert on comic book lore, though Marvel Wiki and DC Universe Wiki have helped a lot. I just enjoy a good action movie. And that is exactly what Marvel Studios has done with their various outings based on different members of the Avengers team. I saw Captain America in the theater, mostly because my cousin thought it was great, and she took me to go see it. I fell in love. Then the Avengers came out. There was a ton of hype surrounding it, but I never saw it. Never really had the time, to be honest. Now that it's out on DVD I think I'll pick it up. But let's get to the point. In our home, my dad previews movies before he lets the rest of the family watch them. He finally got around to Thor when it showed up for free on Amazon Instant video. He said it was okay, so we watched it.

I would love to call Thor a 5 star epic with no flaws, as I can say about Captain America. but simply put, there are some flaws. For one, the story has too many loose ends. I felt like the writers tried to go into too many different aspects of Thor's character and existence, and in the end they stretched themselves too thin, and basically ran out of time. I think what upset me the most was that they didn't go into the relationship of Jane and Thor enough. It was like, you never really knew what was going on between them until she randomly kisses him at the end. I felt like they spent way too much time with the drama in Asgard. They could have left out a lot of the scenes with Thor's crew of warriors, because they didn't add a whole lot to the story anyway. They could have shortened the first battle scene with the Frost Giants and the crew. I thought that they did an outstanding job on Loki, and it was interesting to watch because you never knew if he had good intentions or bad intentions, and you sort of felt sorry for him because I think he didn't even know whether he had good intentions or bad intentions. The action sequences were good, but I always felt like Thor was too good for everyone else and he was just kind of toying with them. Maybe that's how it is in the comics, but to me in this movie he seemed way too god-like. I realize he is a god, but they could have made some of the stuff a little more challenging for him. I also thought what was supposed to be the big final battle with the giant metal robot guy was a little lame. He comes in, destroys the town, kills a couple people, then Thor beats the snot out of him. I thought it was hard to understand exactly why certain things happened. Like, why was Thor exiled in the first place? Why did he go back to Asgard when the girl he loved couldn't go? Why didn't he take her with him? Why did he destroy the bridge? Why didn't he just go back to Earth when he was through with Loki? I just felt like a lot of this stuff could have been tightened up and explained better. I thought that the comedy relief aspect was dead on. This movie was a lot funnier than Captain America. I really liked how they portrayed his dealing with a different and totally foreign culture. However, I do think that they could have spent more time on how he adapted to earth and its's oddness.

Overall, this is a good movie, and one that's worth watching, especially if you want to get a ton of backstory for the Avengers. There are precious few areas where it really shines, and in every other way it's just good enough to get by, with no terrible atrocities. Recommended.",1353628800,,3814,4.201909959072306

4577125,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This has all the markers of a super hero movie - the hero himself, his messed up family life, the evil villain, the girl for whom our hero pines, the end of the world. But those satisfying components aside, I loved this movie for the incredible scenery and effects. The world of the gods was so magnificent and spectacular that I was able to get completely lost in it. Meanwhile back on Earth... things were not looking so good. After everyone is rescued, the hero has learned his lesson, the villain is at bay (or so we are lead to believe), and the girl is now pining for the beautiful god.

Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. He strikes the right balance between rebellious, self-possessed golden boy and hot lover who saves the world.
Natalie Portman plays the science geek who is oblivious to her own sexiness - until Thor sort of wakes her up. She is a bit less believable in this role. The chemistry between Thor and Jane Foster is a bit meh.
Tom Hiddleston as Loki brings the evil-slash-tortured character to life. Never loved, always second... we feel sorry for him, and then we don't, and then we do. Well played, Loki.

His wife's a lukcy woman.
Casting was perfect. Loved all of them but Loki is my favorite -  a tough role to project an increasingly bad guy image but still be at least a little likeable.",1353024000,,653,4.6695652173913045

Thor does this splendidly, and the only complaint would be that it's a tad brief. Arch villain Loki is a revelation; a complex character whose own painful discoveries leave you almost willing him to victory. With previous franchises, I've gotten bored of revisiting the same old villains (Luthor in Superman, Magneto in X-Men- at least until Fassbender's rejuvenation of the character in First Class) but with Loki, I want to see more of him. I want to see his story resolved, not just become a bad guy of the week type scenario. Iron Man might make the money, but Thor/Loki is the emotional core of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; a story that is instantly more intriguing than whatever bigger bad these franchises try to throw at our heroes.

Watching this movie is like sitting through a ""story development meeting"" ... you can almost hear the commentary of the executives: insert action sequence here ... insert emotional speech there ... another explosion here. The dialogue is formula, drab, predictable, and at times descends to groaningly stupid.

The expected mix of wooden acting, followed by forced and fake drama, mixed together with some pretty visuals. This film is like the shiny action hero toys on the shelf at Wal-Mart. Shiny plastic outside: hollow inside.

I think he has become one of the most liked villains, that just goes to show you what a wonderful job he did with his character. Chris is Thor! He reminds me of Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, once you see him you just can't imagine anyone else playing that part. The only gripe I have about this movie is that I wish they would have spent more time in Asgard or another realm besides earth. I wanted more of the fantasy world, but hopefully we will get that with Thor 2! I liked the introduction of Hawkeye in this movie, it was like a little bonus.

4577168,3,B0055EAJ7A,"The epic and complicated mythology connected with Thor, gets a major reworking in Thor (2011), one of the more intricate entries in the ever expanding Marvel movie universe.  A story about Thor inherently involves the duality of the mythological realm of Asgard and the Norse god universe, contrasted against the realm where the mortals of Earth exist.  Extensive special effects are employed to present a vision of this unique fantasy world, however the construct is not always understandable, or the characters particularly convincing.

An uneasy peace exists between Asgard, led by their king Odin (Anthony Hopkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000MGB6N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>), and the frost giants of Jotunheim.  After discovering their enemy in their midst, Thor (Chris Hemsworth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabin-In-The-Woods/dp/B008G33O0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabin In The Woods</a>), his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and a group of warriors, journey to Jotunheim to do battle with the frost giants, with whom a tenuous peace exists.  After a skirmish, Odin intercedes and his sons escape alive, but with the peace now broken, Asgard may now be in danger.

The character's origin gets a complete makeover, as Thor is banished to Earth by his father Odin where he meets astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Swan/dp/B0041KKYEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Swan</a>), and her scientific team.  Stripped of his powers, Thor is regarded as a handsome stranger, who speaks of strange things.  This ploy works in large part, due to a winning performance by Hemsworth, who bears some resemblance to a young Brad Pitt.  The real Thor was clean shaven, so Hemsworth's beard may seem out of place to purists, but after being mortal for much of the film, when Thor finally regains his hammer and his powers are restored, it is truly a glorious moment.

With Loki plotting to take control, Thor's ultimate challenge lies back in Asgard, where special effects tend to take over.  It's a colorful, overdramatic affair, that concludes with some matters left hanging in the air, although Thor's availability for The Avengers (2012) is made abundantly clear.

The godly nature of the character, makes Thor a challenge to capture in a movie, and the special effects are kind of up to par, as the vision isn't always very coherent.  The Dr. Donald Blake from the comics, who tries to keep a low profile, and taps his cane to transform into Thor, is nowhere to be found, as the movie has a completely different tone, and more youthful and modern spin, as Marvel Studios remains focused on the extremely profitable teen audience.  Hemsworth is a physically impressive and engaging Thor, but the story runs a bit long, and drags in several places.  Add in some scenes in Asgard that don't play very well, to some of the good moments on earth, and the overall result is an uneven, semi-entertaining film, that is recommended viewing to Prime members.",1348963200,,3200,5.75

You have to realize how hard is to create a movie of this type with the story and characters involved!

Thor's realm (Asgard) is magically reinvented, with outstanding visuals and really well made costumes! Would like to see a bit more of this.

My only complaint would be the Frost Giants...In the cartoons they were huge like 20 ft tall something ridiculous, but in this version they were actually almost the same size as the asgardians... Just a thought...

Thor's father, Odin performed by Anthony Hopkins is great, best performance of all the characters..

You can really imagine Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the guy is huge as in cartoons with a sort of viking accent...

The premise = totally predictable
The script = simplistic and comic book-like lines (was that on purpose like Sin City? if so, fail!)
The artistic design = rip-offs from LOTR, Star Wars, etc...
The acting = disappointing, especially in regards to senior actors like Sir Anthony Hopkins

The only positive factor, which I am sure was not the plan, was that this movie was so bad, it was hilariously so! I laughed my head off AT the movie to the pathetic end.

The movie has humor, scares, bonus characters, tie ins with other movies, and an overall compelling story line.

For me, the father-son triad of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) really make this film a treat. Anthony Hopkins owns the floor as the King of Asgard, as always; his chill-inducing banishment speech to Thor has been practically immortalized. Even as a spoiled brat warrior prince, Thor is fun and likable; and when he comes into his own with humility and sacrifice, you can't help but admire him. As for Loki, if you can't appreciate the subtlety and finesse with which Tom Hiddleston manipulates every facet of this character, if you can't sympathize with the pain Loki expresses when begging and screaming to know his true identity, then you have no heart.

Once the movie began, I understood why.  The titular character is personified by handsome new ""heartthrob"" Chris Hemsworth, who turned in a fabulous performance, and no one else could ever be Thor after seeing Hemsworth in the role.  Tom Hiddleston was stellar as Loki, and Natalie Portman was perfect as Thor's love interest.  The story was well-written and memorable, and pacing was excellent.  It never dragged.  The special effects and costumes were impressive.  My husband, daughter, and son-in-law loved it, too.

In the theater, we saw it in 2D.  We liked it enough to buy the DVD/3D Bluray combo pack.  We watched it in 3D on our Samsung SmartTV, and the 3D was so good that the movie was even more enjoyable.

The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels.

4577194,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Hemsworth was an excellent choice for Thor. I was impressed. I'm going to have to consider not allowing my wife to see the movie, since he does parade around sans shirt at one point. Ray Stevenson, also, was excellent. It was good to see the Warriors Three in the film.

Asgard has a great look. It's very Jack Kirby. Stan Lee makes his traditional cameo. There's a nod to Journey Into Mystery, the comic book in which Thor makes his first appearance, if you're paying enough attention to catch it. And it was good to see Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) get more play. Even Hawkeye makes a brief appearance, which was also great. Anthony Hopkins filled out the role of Odin perfectly, and he probably didn't even break a sweat doing it. Although he did lose an eye.

None of this to say that the movie didn't have some faults. There were some changes made to Marvel cannon that I can't bring myself to approve of. The main one, on the surface, was made for ""story"" reasons, but it wasn't necessary. If you're not a comic person, a Thor person, specifically, you'll never know, but it's one of those things that, as a fan, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they did that. Yes, it bothers me. But it doesn't affect the movie itself. The main flaw with movie is a bit of waffling with the character of Thor. He vacillates between being confused about Earth and seeming to not know where he is or what's going on to being very wise about Earth and the ways of man. It's like they couldn't decide which way to play the character and so used either of the extremes to fit the mood they wanted at any given moment. It would have been okay to have started at confused and ended at wise, but going back-and-forth doesn't really work.",1346025600,,1732,4.409375

4577197,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Overall, there's a lot of action in this movie, some great visual effects, but seriously lacking in the story department (development) and characterization.
The story follows a comic book character (which I haven't read) Thor as he has some disagreements with his father (the King) on leadership styles, gets exiled to Earth, meets a girl, finds out his brother is a bad dude, and ends up saving Earth and his world from certain doom.  Well, that's kind of the story, generally.
First, the issues I had with this. The main character, Thor, wasn't all that interesting. He didn't hook me, interest me, intrigue me with who he was, what he was about and what he wanted. Main characters and villains are critical in the story. I think the villain was slightly better developed than Thor.
The world he came from, was just plain hokey, the way they portrayed it. It came across ver unrealisitc (all the armor was too perfectly shiny, the capes were unnecessary). It didn't feel real to me.  Fine if you want to take me to another world. Ok. But you have to make that world ""real"" to the audience. If we don't ""buy in"" to the world, it's going to be hard to sell the story and characters.
The subplot love story was really pointless. I'm not convinced it added anything to the story, or the characters. It felt more like a high school crush to me.
I still don't get what the bad brother was trying to do. It didn't made sense to me. Not very well developed either (not sure if that's bad writing on the comic book series, or bad writing on the script or both).
The good things, I did like some of the visuals, and some of the directing was nice. Obviously they spent some money with VFX.
It would have been great if they had put equally the amount of effort in the story and character development.
If you're looking for an action movie, don't care much about story, this might be the perfect movie to watch. I was left wanting more, than it delievered.
I would not buy this for my collection.",1345248000,,1986,4.46831955922865
4577198,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I will start out by saying I am not much of a comic book fan. But I enjoy a good action movie now and then. I really didn't have high expectaions when I started watching this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the actual storyline. The Earth parts of the movie seemed a little cheesy and cliche but Asgard was very impressive and had surprising depth.
The most surprising and interesting part of this movie for me was the character of Loki. The hero always gets a flushed out character development, but it's rare to see the villan's history and how he became a villan. To me how a villan became corrupt is just as interesting as how a hero became a hero.
I loved how both brothers started out as equals striving to become king. One was conceited and reckless while the other mischevious but otherwise honorable. While Thor had to learn humility and his rightful place, Loki had to contend with the fact that he had been lied to as a child and was never going to be equal with his brother.
Tom Hiddleston who played the character of Loki was very good at portraying the complex emotions of this intriging villan.
Over all I didn't love this movie, but I did like it. I am invested in seeing where the story might go from here. Especially to see if there is any redemption for the fallen brother.",1344902400,,1300,4.398340248962656

4577201,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I agree with the other reviewers who think the romance subplot needed more time. But compared with other action films, ""Thor"" is one of the most romantic of the genre. It's a very subtle romance, because that's how Branagh works. When Thor is exiled to Earth as a mortal, he finds himself dependent upon this feisty little human woman who not only helps him, but stands up to him and tells him to straighten up his act and think about other people for once. Hemsworth does a great job using facial expressions, body stance, and tone of voice to convey Thor's journey from bewilderment at her presumption to being intrigued and beginning to admire her, then wanting to please and help her, and finally, being willing to give up his life to save her. It doesn't hurt that he and Portman have great onscreen chemistry either.

Visually this movie is a stunner. The shots of Asgard, both exteriors and interiors, are gorgeous. (As a Terry Pratchett fan, I also loved that they made Asgard a discworld!) Loki is (as others have said) one of the best villains ever, because you can understand his pain and why he does what he does after he finds out the truth of his parentage. Hiddleston makes you believe that he means well and has some ambivalence about the things he does. He and Thor share the same hubris and pay a similar price, but there's no Jane waiting to help Loki get his priorities straight.",1343779200,2,1399,4.573705179282869

This story is one of the Marvel comic hero stories which introduce The Avengers one at a time (Captain America is another Marvel superhero from last year). The story has many action scenes and Chris Hemsworth is delightful as the displaced god of thunder.

4577204,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I suppose any review of *Thor* ought to begin with the reviewer's expectations--if you're expecting a solid comic book/mythology movie with a strong sense of the comics ethos, a solid leading man who thoroughly inhabits all aspects of his character (from bathos to boorishness), a rather one-dimensional villain, and lots of rock `em-sock `em action encased in a simple, mediocre plot--then you will probably be satisfied with *Thor.* If you're expecting anything else, you can pass on this one. The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile. Despite these two casting mistakes, the film is an enjoyable diversion, and it works well--as long as you're not expecting it to be something other than what it claims to be.",1343606400,,1302,4.977064220183486

4577206,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Yes, Thor is a Marvel superhero, and this movie is based on the comic books. But before Stan Lee introduced him as part of his Marvel line-up, he was a mythological character. This movie effectively fits into the sword and sorcery genre -- I would consider it this more so than a typical superhero movie.

This movie features Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, but to me the strength of the acting was carried by Chris Hemsworth whose character grew from hothead to a real leader while keeping likable throughout, and also Tim Hiddleston who was excellent as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Joshua Dalla, Jamie Alexander, and Darcy Lewis all were excellent in their supporting roles.

The only drawback -- I believe this movie and Captain America came out to create interest in the Avengers movie that came out this year. Hawkeye the archer makes a brief appearance that I believe was not really necessary for this movie, but very helpful in giving him an introduction for his role in the Avengers. However, does this mean it's a bad movie? Not at all. It still is great entertainment.

One final note -- if you look at the scenes, you'll notice the ending credits is the next to the last one. Huh? Yes, there's a final scene following the credits.",1343606400,,1272,4.746606334841629

4577212,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Originally, I put off seeing this film, and believe it or not, it wasn't because I was afraid it would have elements of paganism in it.  I just didn't like the visual look of the film, from what I'd seen of the trailers, nor did I like some of the casting choices (although Anthony Hopkins as Odin is -fantastic.-)

Well, if I had been worried about paganism, I needn't have.  They make it quite clear in this movie that Thor is merely a long-lived alien being with very advanced technology.  In fact, they make it much more clear than in the comics of the same name, and none of the characters ever refer to themselves as ""gods.""

Thor is a vain and arrogant warrior, who's spoiling for a fight, even as he's about to be crowned the new king of Asgard.  However, he soon betrays the trust of his father, risking his life and the lives of all his people, and nearly causing a war.  Enraged, his father Odin takes away not only the crown, but his powers and royal station, casting him to Earth in anger, and placing an enchantment on Thor's hammer, so that only those who are worthy may pick it up and weild its power.

A fair part of the movie takes place while Thor is de-powered and trying to get his hammer and powers back, or else adjusting to his new life as a human being.  However, in the end, (spoilers) he attempts to sacrifice himself for the people he cares about, and is deemed worthy to weild the hammer once again.

One drawback of Thor spending most of the movie without any powers is that it's a bit difficult to tell, if you've never read about the character, just what his powers are, exactly.  This is helped by a big fight early in the film, and another couple of fights near the end, but these are sometimes shot from imperfect angles, or happen a little fast, and it can be difficult to keep track of what, precisely, is going on.

However, I was stunned by just how Christian this movie is.  It's not just that it's not a pagan story.  This movie tells the story of mankind from the Christian point of view.  Mortal man begins as a beloved son; an heir, and just as he comes into his inheritance, he makes a foolish decision, chooses to sin against his father, is cast out, and in the end, through self-sacrifice, virtue and the mercy of his father, he is admitted back into his birthright again, although some aren't so fortunate.

That brings me to Loki; the villain.  I think he may be the best villain out of any of the movies that Marvel Studios has made.  He begins as not really evil, exactly, and even wanting to protect his kingdom, but as time goes on, and he discovers new things about himself and his people, he becomes desperate, and his good intentions begin taking him down a path of deep evil.  He's so much more complex than someone like the Iron Mongrel, who just wants cash, or Abomination, who's in it for a thrill and an ego trip.  Loki doesn't even go on a rampage, like so many of them do.  He has an evil plan, and he doesn't let on exactly what it is until almost the last second.

In a way, I found it hard to get excited about the bad guy because of that last point.  It would be one thing if we understood what Loki was planning from the beginning, and knew what a nasty threat he was, but he doesn't make his evil plot very well understood until rather late in the film, which decreases the tension somewhat.

There's a sort of interesting juxtaposition between Thor and Loki as the film progresses; Loki growing more evil and corrupt, and Thor learns the hard lessons that only real life can teach.  It's an interesting way to tell a story, and I was amazed by just how true it rang.

I've been told by some that the romance between Thor and Jane Foster felt forced.  To this I reply ""There was a romance?""  I mean, sure, they talk a lot, and they share a kiss at the end, but I wouldn't exactly call it a romance, since it's never terribly romantic, there's really nothing going on between the characters, and nothing of any substance comes of it.  Thor just came off as a decent guy who wanted to help her out, and he did.  That's all I think needs to be said about it.

Finally, back to my initial point; by first worry; that the visual look and casting of the movie wasn't what I wanted it to be.  Was that as much of a problem as I thought it would be?

Well, honestly, yes.

I still don't think Chris Hemsworth is quite big enough to be Thor.  I still don't think Heimdall should have been black.  I still don't think Volstagg was -anywhere near- big enough.  Most importantly, I don't think the technology of Asgard should have looked quite as much like technology as it did.

The moment Thor says ""your ancestors called it magic, you call it science,"" I groan.  As much as I may dislike paganism, it's not nearly as much of a threat as it once was.  Secularism is.  I'm fine with them -saying- that Thor is not a god.  They don't need to imply that nothing truly miraculous exists.  These things bother me through nearly every visually-impressive scene in the film.

In conclusion, I did like this film.  Rest assured, you won't be drawn into paganism by it, and it might even inspire you to think a little more about the values of love and sacrifice, which is always a good thing to think about.  I wish it had distanced itself a little more from modern, secular skepticism, but it was certainly a better film than I thought it would be.",1342051200,2,5399,4.327363184079602
4577213,5,B0055EAJ7A,I am happy I found this dvd.  I have been looking for it for a while. It came on time and it worked.,1341964800,,100,3.347826086956522
4577214,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I've been waiting to see this for quite some time and it was worth the wait! One of the best ""Avenger"" movies yet!",1341964800,,114,4.0
4577215,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I think ""The God of Thunder"" would have been an awesome title for this film. It's more artistic, in my opinion. Anyway, that's not important. My sentiments on the film are as follows. First of all, Thor is very nice to look at (the movie, not the actor...or maybe they both are, but not to me). In other words, the special effects and cinematography are obviously the work of people who knew what they wanted, and how to achieve it. What they created is a unique vision, that separates itself from the pack, and decides to take a chance on some things. Perhaps the overuse of Dutch Angles will get to some people, but that didn't bother me. I was most annoyed at how frequently that one 7-Eleven showed up in the background. A little product placement doesn't bother me, but come on. Nevertheless, it's exciting to watch, and a delight to see. Asgard has to be one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen in quite a while, and it came to life brilliantly thanks to the fantastic transfer. Colors pop, and the image remains sharp throughout the lighter scenes. Obviously, more detail will be visible with more light. In fact, the only problems in the transfer can be blamed on darker scenes. I've come to expect dark scenes in films to look murky, and sometimes soft. This one is no exception. Unfortunately, there is a good amount of dark scenes, with important things to see in them at that. Thor has damn good picture quality, that's near reference, despite its shortcomings.

Director Kenneth Brannaugh has brought his Shakesperian background to the Marvel Universe, and what he created is an epic story that spans three worlds, with a very strong and tragic family dynamic, as well as a few moderately underwhelming action scenes. The first set piece in Jotunheim (the Frost Giant realm) is fantastic, albeit a tad dark. I didn't mind the darkness, because it was a snowy terrain, but I wanted to see the great make-up work they did on the Giants. I also enjoyed Thor's bout with his brother, Loki, as well as Heimdall fighting the two Frost Giants for a brief second, as well as Thor infiltrating the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound. You're probably think, ""well what else is left?"" I guess the reason I felt the action was lacking overall is because the fight I was most anticipating, besides the iconic Thor vs. Loki, turned out to be the weakest in the film. That would be Thor, The Warriors Three and Lady Sif vs. The Destroyer. But anyway, the same thing that happened with both of the Iron Man films, happened here. The same could probably be said for Captain America. The ongoing trend with the films in the Avengers series is well fleshed out, and acted, characters that have many good moments to show their personalities (strengths and weaknesses), surrounded by a well-rounded cast, but lacking in the kick-ass action department (with the exception of The Incredible Hulk). Don't get me wrong, it's still never dull, and the flawless 7.1 audio is sure to rattle a window or two.

The humor in this film surprised me as well. From the trailers, it seemed like Kat Dennings was going to provide a few lame attempts to squeeze a chuckle or two out of the audience. To my surprise, I laughed at pretty much all of the intended jokes. I have to admit, I even found myself enjoying the film more on Blu-ray than I did in theaters. I can't quite say why, but I did. To my surprise, the two strongest parts of the movie were the least known, and probably most questionable selections of the producers. I'm talking about the two lead actors. Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki. Hemsworth has the look, obviously. He looks like he was pulled right off of the page. This may just be the role he was born to play. He was probably only known for his brief scene in Star Trek prior to this, if that. His role was pivotal, and his performance was great, but he was probably forgotten by many, due to the dynamic cast of that movie. Here he really gets his time to shine, and shine he sure does. Going in, Hiddleston was a complete unknown in my book. I usually prefer actors I recognize to play roles as big as his, but I'm surprised to say I loved him. His performance really gets to you. He's playing the main villain, but not once did I root against him. You really feel bad for Loki as the story unfolds, and Hiddleston couldn't have been better at conveying that heartbreak, and sorrow. So if you're looking to be dazzled, and for a rich, Shakesperian family drama, Thor is highly recommended. It's definitely a must own for Marvel fans, and fans of the comics.

4577224,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Well personally i like some romance in films especially in a super hero movie and felt that in this perspective it was lacking. Its obvious she liked Thor from the beginning but he didn't really show any sign of liking her (including the hand kissing, its a mid evil tradition it doesn't count). Then suddenly near the end of the movie she kisses him and suddenly loves her to a point where he would do anything in his power to be reunited with her. It was a poor romance film in my opinion.
Secondly I really don't see why the Jotuns couldn't have been destroyed he gave up his love for a bunch of giant blue guys who's life's joy is to see Odin (Thor's father)slayed.
In truth it took me a couple times of watching the film to realize many of the plot's details. Such as Lafi's son is Loki (missed that part)etc.
Lastly, personally I feel after Thor's exile and when the hammer was once again his it was stronger (probably becasuse Thor was worthy bla bla bla.

4577226,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor was the last of the Avengers films I needed to watch. And it did excite, at times, though I wish there were more of Thor. The first 30 minutes of the film was great, a great battle between Thor and his four friends attack the frost giants in an epic and well done battle. From then on it dropped downhill, but with enough great settings and special effects, that it does excite.

What I give the most praise to in this film is Director Kenneth Branagh. His camera angles and the upside down views were interesting and depicted the separation of worlds. And the look of Asgard, as a city, was well crafted and beautifully rendered by the effects team. It was straight from the comics and done excellently on screen. The Gatekeeper was a great addition, I was glad he was in the film. Anthony Hopkins(""Silence Of The Lambs""), plays a good Odin and Chris Hemsworth is the perfect actor as the god of thunder. Loki is also an exciting character, his wickedness shows well here as performed by the great Tom Hiddleston. And of course his plans for the future begin in this movie.

Now that a Thor 2, Iron Man 3 and a Captain America 2 have been green lit, and that leading into the next Avengers film.  It looks like its gonna be a great few years for Marvel on the big screen.

4577228,3,B0055EAJ7A,"3 1/2 Stars = Very Good

With all the comic book hero films coming out, it seems like an onslaught of cinema vigilantism. The super heroes are fighting off all would be terrorist, at the nearest cinemaplex! I guess it is a sign of the times. Many of us living out our own repressed vigilante emotions through the silver screen, or should it be, the 3-D screen? We're also having a lot of fun doing it, but like any genre onslaught, there is a mixed bag of popcorn movies, some freshly popped with the right amount of butter & salt, others with one to many old maids sitting at the bottom of the bag, waiting for you to crack your tooth on.

""Thor"" sits at the bottom of the better upper third of the onslaught. The perfect film for that bag of popcorn & large pop that cost you $20 extra. Don't fear though, the sound of the popcorn your chewing inside your mouth won't make you miss any great social commentary.  Then again, with the exception of truly groundbreaking genre films like, ""Watchmen,"" & the last two Batman's, these films are not meant to be huge beacons of social commentary. Just sit back & enjoy the fun! ""Thor"" does exactly what it sets out to do, a movie for the escapists in all of us. Close to two hours of just sit back & veg out. Sure, it has it themes of arrogance, jealously, love, & heroism, but it does not demand you to sit & watch it five times to catch all the nuances & red herrings. It just wants you to come along for the ride, which is not the greatest thrill ride of the genre, but an enjoyable outing in outer space to the desert of New Mexico.

""Thor"" features very good special effects & CGI, more or less, one in the same anymore. It has likeable characters, some down right funny scenes, & Chris Hemsworth plays the role of the lighting god with charisma & a twinkle in his eye, winking away at the audience. I got to say though, when Thor puts on civilian earth clothes, I kept expecting him to grab a guitar & sing a country song, LOL! I think they should've made his hair longer for the role, because he looked more like a country music flavor of the day hunk, than a Viking god, but oh well, that's just me. Oh, there is also a funny reference to King Arthur, as Thor's hammer is protruding from a pillar of rock in the desert. All the local he-men, a four wheel drive pickup truck, whose bed pops off, & Thor himself, try to pull it free from the rock, just like ""Excalibur,"" but to no avail. Only the one worthy, will be able to wield the hammer of Thor!

In the end, I found ""Thor"" to be a very enjoyable, though not an amazing comic book hero film, but I do see where it could go on to something bigger & better, ""the Avengers."" It is definitely a film all ages can & will enjoy, & there is a sequel in the works!

At one point, a car flips over and you can actually see the lines from the wire that weren't edited properly. They could have done so much more with the mythology and played on the elements of a god that once worshipped by us journeying to a world that no longer believes in him, or even just some more prods to the actual myths, but there was little there.

4577241,4,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR is a visually stunning movie well worth seeing.  The lead actors--Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin--all perform admirably, though I do wish that the story had hewed rather more closely to the original vision of Jack Kirby, Thor's primary co-creator in the Marvel comics.

Now I think most readers of this review will be surprised and confused to hear that Jack Kirby was the primary co-creator of Marvel's Thor, and not Stan Lee.  Indeed I love the dialogue and captioning that Mr. Lee wrote, but Stan's own words show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator not only of Thor but also of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including the THOR film and THE AVENGERS.

Here's what Stan Lee said when asked to talk about Jack Kirby:

""BOB [Brodsky, interviewer]: Jack Kirby?

""STAN: When you talk about Kirby you really run out of superlatives. Jack was a writer as well as an artist (as many of the legends were). He was incredibly imaginative and he did his most important writing with his drawing. When I say that I mean if I gave Jack a very brief idea of what I wanted for a story, he would run with it.

""I could say 'Jack in this next story, I think I'd like to have Dr. Doom kidnap Sue Storm and bring her to Liberia [obviously Stan meant Latveria], then the Fantastic Four have to go after her and in the end Dr. Doom may promise that he won't hurt Sue if they do something, and Reed says OK I agree, and the Thing would say how can you trust him, and Reed would say despite all of his faults Doom is a man of honor, he would never lie.'

""I would discuss the idea with Jack like that and that was all I had to do. And then Jack would go home and he would draw the story and he would add a million elements that I hadn't told him about, so he was really writing in pictures and dreaming up ideas along the way.

""And then when I did write the copy (the words, the dialogue and the captions) it was such a joy because all I had to do was look at the illustration that Jack had done and each picture gave me a thousand new ideas. Jack never did a dull panel. Every drawing of his contained an expression [in] the characters' face that almost told me what kind of dialogue to write. Jack could get more drama into a few lines than any artist I knew. His imagination and the things he came up with were wonderful . . . and on top of that, he was fast!

""I don't know how anybody could have been that good and that fast . . . when Jack drew, you had the feeling that Jack had the entire drawing in his mind and when he put the pencil on the paper he was just 'tracing' what he already had in his mind. Most artists would draw a circle for the head and a circle for the body and then they'd start filling it in, but Jack would just start with the head and he would draw it and every line was there right from the start. He didn't make little rough drawings first . . . it was the most eerie feeling watching him draw--you felt he was tracing what was already in his head. Jack Kirby . . . he was the most dependable artist in the world, he never missed a deadline. He never did a bad job . . . all his jobs were great.

""It's hard to talk about Jack without sounding as if you're exaggerating because that's how good he was.""

--Comic Book Marketplace magazine, # 61, July 1998, pages 48-49.

What Stan says above fits perfectly with this item from the Marvel Bullpen Bulletin for March 1966, which I presume was written by Stan, and at any rate was published by Marvel, of course:

""It isn't generally known, but many of our merry Marvel artists are also talented story men in their own right! For example, all Stan has to do with the pro's like JACK 'KING' KIRBY, dazzlin' DON HECK, and darlin' DICK AYERS is give them the germ of an idea, and they make up all the details as they go along, drawing and plotting out the story. Then, our leader simply takes the finished drawings and adds all the dialogue and captions! Sounds complicated? Maybe it is, but it's another reason why no one else can bring you that old Marvel magic!""

This is the most thoroughgoing Marvel-published admission of Jack's towering primacy as to the creation of the Kirby/Lee stories that I have ever seen.

It should also be noted that Larry Lieber, Stan's brother, wrote the outstanding and thrilling dialogue for the very first story with Marvel's Thor (the origin story, and also a few issues after that), but did so only after Jack had created most or all of the story by drawing it.

Again, I love the wonderful dialogue and captioning that Stan wrote, but Stan's own words, quoted above, show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including THOR and THE AVENGERS.

Stan was indispensable of course, but so, of course, was Jack Kirby, and now is the time to heap just and due honors upon this great, great storyteller for his stunning, splendid, visionary achievement.",1339027200,,5350,4.327672327672327

4577244,4,B0055EAJ7A,"""Thor"" is fairly unique amongst superhero films in that it has multiple characters that are complex in their motivations and experience signifigant character development throughout the course of the film. Most notably this applies to both the hero of the tale, Thor, and the villain, his brother Loki. Both characters start at different places than they finish, and undergo believable character arcs, and Loki's motivations are far more intricate and involved than your typical villain fare, making him far more compelling than your typical world-conquerer or power-grabber. As for the look of Asgard and its inhabitants? A regal fantasy world that remains embedded in your memories. Oh, and of course there's the action in the bits where Thor actually has his hammer (which isn't for most of the movie, surprisingly...). Still, Thor is a fun movie with characters that provide an interesting drama about familial relationships.

4577246,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I don't have a whole lot more to add about ""Thor"" that the other positive reviewers haven't already stated so eloquently.  However, my take on this breathtaking movie is how operatic it is, both in content and mood.  Specifically, for those familiar with Richard Wagner's ""Der Ring Des Nibelungen"", I believe that ""Thor"" pays homage to Wagner's renown tetralogy, especially the first of the four operas, ""Das Rhinegold"".
The Ring Cycle, as it's also known, is based largely on Nordic and to some extent, Teutonic legends, mythology, and folklore.  For example, ""The Rainbow Bridge"" in ""Thor"" is highlighted at the end of ""Rhinegold"".  The German counterpart to Thor has a minor role in ""Rhinegold"".  And of course tumultuous family strife plays out prominently in both ""Thor"" and The Ring Cycle.  Details differ of course, as they are bound to do in works of art separated by over 100 years.  But key themes and motifs parallel one another in both of these art forms.  The similarities to me are quite striking, even though one is a movie and the other an opera.  I find both immensely enjoyable and emotionally stirring in parts.",1337990400,6,1130,4.87434554973822

4577251,5,B0055EAJ7A,"In the magical and mystical realms of Asguard where Norse legends are told, a brave but arrogant warrior named Thor (Chris Hensworth) has caused a ruckus on another realm and making his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) upset, indeed so mad that his father banishes him out of Asguard on Earth where he is a mortal man who will learn humility as punishment. Odin even sends the mighty hammer down on Earth in a stone much like in ""Sword in the Stone"" where only that worthy person can obtain the hammer, Thor falls in love with a scientist named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where she teaches him things he might soon learn about. His half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleson) has plans like terrorizing the people on Earth and taking over Asguard as the new leader, when Thor's 4 friends (Ray Stevenson, Tanabou Asandu, Jaime Alexander and Josh Dallas) hear about this they head to Earth to warn Thor but can the god of thunder learn what it means to be a true hero?

An outstanding and worthy companion in the Avengers-Marvel saga as it started with the prequel ""Captain America"" and ends with this movie as the final piece of the linking puzzle that leads to the excellent ""Avengers"" movie. This fantasy-adventure is a nice throwback to those wonderful 80s fantasy epics like ""Willow"", ""Conan 1 & 2"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Excalibur"", ""Clash of the Titans"" and others. The acting is great as is the special effects that make Asguard look fantastic as if you were transported to that magical world and the storytelling is great as well as it follows the comics nicely. The film co-stars Samuel L Jackson, Colm Ferroee and Rene Russo, director Kenneth Brangh who is one of the most acclaimed directors around has brought some shakespearian opera level drama to this movie and a great sense of fun as it was something different for him. I should say if you are know the chronology to The Avengers movies then start with Captain America, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and finally this to link the story that leads up to the best Marvel film ever made.

4577253,4,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR is what my idea of what a comic book movie should be - big, colorful, loud, a little bit corny at times, but hugely entertaining throughout.

Kenneth Branagh's unabashedly colorful and fun take on the material offers memorable production design from Bo Welch, with sets and costumes that look like they just flew off the Marvel pages (I don't think I've seen anything like the Asgard scenes since ""Flash Gordon"", with plenty of rousing action to match.

Chris Hemsworth is undeniably charismatic as Odin's son, who is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins) after putting the kingdom of Asgard in trouble with his callous actions. Unlike some other, pre-fab Aussie leading men we've seen of late (Sam Worthington, anyone?), Hemsworth is the real deal, effortlessly navigating his way through the material with the right dash of arrogance and empathy (like many of the Marvel films, there's ultimately a moral to this story). Action, humor, and fantasy all come together as Thor falls for a mere mortal grad student (Natalie Portman, so much more appealing than she was in the Star Wars prequels) who becomes infatuated with our muscle-bound hero, while Hopkins doesn't just cash the check as Odin and other roles are satisfyingly filled by the likes of Stellan Skaarsgard (Portman's professor boss), Kat Dennings (her friend), Idris Elba (Asgard's gatekeeper) and Tom Hiddelston as Loki, Thor's troubled brother who we're about to see a good deal more of in next summer's ""The Avengers.""

Speaking of that much-anticipated super-hero team mash-up, the lead-in material to that picture is incorporated into the story here far more organically than ""Iron Man 2"" - Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye makes a very brief appearance but people who don't know who he is won't be sitting there, thinking that the movie has stopped dead to incorporate references to ""The Avengers.""

The pacing is a little bit odd at times as the movie flips between the Asgard and Earth sequences, and if anything, could have used more character development (it's cut lean under 2 hours), but overall I was very much entertained. This is colorful, romantic genre entertainment with a dynamic Patrick Doyle score that's the most satisfying work I've heard from the composer since his Halcyon days of the mid `90s.

Paramount has brought ""Thor"" to BD in a number of different flavors including a Blu-Ray/3-D Blu-Ray/DVD copy. The HD image on the Blu-Ray is expectedly strong (1080p AVC encoded widescreen), though I wasn't so crazy about the use of 3-D with the picture: more often than not it dims the movie's vivid cinematography, offering only occasional ""depth of field"" type of effects that are really noticeable. The DTS MA sound is strong on all the renditions, while extras include 24 minutes of deleted scenes (some of which would've helped the pacing) in HD, brief featurettes (there's a Patrick Doyle interview that runs barely two minutes), a commentary from Branagh and some connecting featurettes designed to sell ""The Avengers,"" though little in the way of footage from the much-anticipated super-hero match-up.",1337040000,4,3103,5.100393700787402

4577255,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Marvel certainly knows how to make entertaining, fun films. If you enjoyed ""Iron Man"" then chances are you will enjoy ""Thor"". Both movies have a similar comedic tone throughout so that they don't take themselves overly serious. You don't need to know much about Thor before seeing this movie - I didn't - since the first part explains what you need to know. This is a fun action-packed superhero movie with a decent plot and wonderful writing.

The special effects, especially the realm of Asgard, are extremely well done. While about the first half of the movie takes place there, most of the rest takes place on Earth, so it doesn't feel too alien or foreign. When Thor has his hammer he is virtually all-powerful and seems to derive joy from conflict. What makes his character so likable though is that he is fallible and despite some ego, he is humbled and learns from his mistakes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is also very handsome and chivalrous. Besides Thor and his brother Loki, the major characters include a couple human scientists, portrayed by Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgrd. Portman's character falls in love with Thor, while Skarsgrd's character is the overly protective father figure.

While the effects are very good and the acting is great, what seemed to make the movie so enjoyable was the writing. The dialog was very witty at times without being ridiculous. Although the story was a bit predictable, the interesting characters kept it from being boring. The ending makes it clear a sequel is being planned and I'll be glad to see it.",1336780800,3,1568,4.803703703703704

4577260,4,B0055EAJ7A,"(Much Overdue Review Of Movie)

Well, now that the 'Avengers' has hit theaters and getting rave reviews, I decided it was time to get my 'Thor' review submitted.  FYI, I haven't seen 'Avengers' yet, but WILL be seeing it next week.  So far it's getting AMAZING reviews and I have high hopes for it.  Is it possible the movie studios are not butchering super-hero movies anymore?  Here's hoping...

Anywho...I myself watched 'Thor' on the big screen last summer, and rewatched it this last weekend on television.  Call me crazy, but this film almost seems to get better after multiple viewings.  Does the film have it's flaws, YES.  Is it more of a prequel and less of a stand alone movie, ABSOLUTELY.  But despite this it still has some solid action and is quite necessary to watch before viewing the 'Avengers'.

**(Warning, Some Spoilers Ahead, In Case You Haven't Seen This Yet...)**

--Story/Premise--

The film begins with a brief flashback of the Norse God Odin (Anthony Hopkins) coming down to Midgar, aka Earth, and defending it from a Frost Giant invasion.  He loses his right eye during these battles and saves Earth from an induced ice age.  Flashing forward we get to see Thor and Loki as children getting educated by their father in the armery.  We see Thor's hammer Mjolnir sitting there long before Thor begins to wield it.

Well...Thor grows up and is about to have the kingship of Asgard transferred to him, when a covert Frost Giant attack occurs.  Odin summons the Destroyer to dispatch the invaders and they are fryed instantly.  It appeared the attackers were after (The Casket Of Ancient Winters.)  (-Source Wikipedia)

This angers Thor tremendously and he wants to go confront them in their own realm.  Odin forbids this and leaves Thor, his will clear.  He also reminds Thor he is not king yet.  Long story short, Thor and his companions and Loki travel to Jotunheim and a HUGE battle ensues.  Thor fights, and probably kills, numerous Frost Giants AND some huge Frost Giant monster.  The Asgardians are still outnumbered and would have died, until Odin appears and stops the fight.  But...the damage is done, and Jotunheim says the truce with Asgard has been broken, thus war will be coming.

Odin and Thor and his warriors return to Asgard through the Bifrost.  Thor's vanity and immaturity peak here and he insults Odin one too many times.  Odin in anger strips him of his powers, makes him mortal, and enchanted Mjolnir so that only a worthy person can wield it.  He then banishes Thor to Earth.

For anyone who watches 'Iron-Man 2' past the end credits, you would have seen Thor's hammer in the ground in New Mexico.  This scene is in this film also.  Also, FYI, there are posts going around that you can see Thor in the 'Incredible Hulk' movie.  I can't confirm this though.  Apparently there is a random bolt of lighting in the background in the movie.  It's at the end where the Hulk and the Abomination are fighting.  Some claim this is the part where Thor is sent to Earth by Odin.  Who knows...pop in your copy and watch for it and you decide.

I personally found the banishment portion of the film quite slow and feel it hurt the movie overall.  It does serve a purpose, it humbles Thor and makes him care for Midgar.  Still though, when you pay to see action and you have 20 minutes of no action, you feel cheated.

The film does get back on track, Thor proves himself worthy and gets his grove back.  Loki's deceiving is revealed and after a pretty cool fight falls into a wormhole.  Of course he survives and is set up to become the main villain in the 'Avengers'.

--After Credits Clip--

For those who watch after the credits, there is once again a Sam Jackson clip.  The clip is quite crucial to see.  It contains the Cosmic Cube, the blue cube from 'Captain America', and will be the primary focus in the 'Avengers'.  We also see that Loki is here on Earth now and is manipulating Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard).

--Character/Casting Decisions--

(Chris Hemsworth as Thor):  Great decision in my opinion.  Hemsworth looks like Thor and really gave this role 100 percent.  I first remember seeing him as Capt. Kirk's dad in the 'Star Trek' revamp.  He's the one who stays with the ship and crashed it into the Romulan ship, saving a lot of federation lives.  I personally think Chris's attempt at a Norse accent is a success.  Not too strong, but dominating when called for.  It is also obvious that he packed on the muscle for the role, and combined with the AMAZING costume, nailed the part.  I have high hopes for his part in the 'Avengers' and believe his character will get a lot of screen time.

(Anthony Hopkins as Odin):  Another good decision.  An actor we have all loved for years, I mean who hasn't seen 'Silence of the Lambs' at one time or another.  I was actually surprised he accepted the role.  Hopkins usually sticks with thrillers and horrors or dramas.  A super-hero film seemed out of place for him.  But...I'm glad he did take it.  Hopkins also looks the part.  I am disappointed he did not have his ravens much in the film.  This is a defining feature of this character, not having his ravens was a bad call.  Still, nothing worth rasing too much of a fuss about.  Overall a good performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins.

(Tom Hiddleston as Loki):  I was not familier with this actor before seeing Thor, but I'm sure we all will be seeing more of him now.  If I had to rank which actor gave the BEST performance, he would be number 1 in the film.  First of he looks the part.  Second he actually wears his signature helmet with those long horns.  Thor wears his helmet once the entire film!!!  Hiddleston is able to go from one side of the emotional spectrum to other with the snap of a finger.  He gave off a creepy vibe sometimes as well, you really felt like this was someone you couldn't trust.  His whole confliction when he discovers he is a Frost Giant was pulled off fantastic.  You find yourself the viewer feeling for him one minute, and wanting Thor to bash his skull in the next.  I am confidant he will be a GREAT villian in the 'Avengers' and can't wait to see his performance.

There are other actors in this film, but I have nor the space nor time to review them all.  I will say I don't believe Rene Russo added much to the movie.  Natalie Portman was OKAY, but not stellar, in my opinion.  Lady Sif and the Warriors Three were overall good, I hope to see more of them someday as well.

--Various Home Releases--

I personally will be buying the Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack here soon.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, but I can still watch the DVD.  However when I do finally upgrade, I'll already have the Blu-Ray.  FYI, it appears the Blu-Ray has the most special features and deleted scenes.  DVD's are on their way out, and anymore get only the most basic of special features.

There is a 3D Blu-Ray release of this.  I personally don't like 3D movies though.  I already wear eyeglasses, so trying to wear another pair of glasses over them is a mess.  Also, I got a huge headache from watching 'Tron: Legacy' in 3D and swore of 3D movies forever after that experience.  Bottom line, if your a fan of 3D movies, your in luck, they have released this movie in 3D.  Now all you need is the expensive 3D tv and expensive 3D Blu-Ray player...

I would personally just go with the 2d Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.

--In Conclusion--

An overall good film despite it's lull periods.  Good casting decisions for the major roles, and a good setup for the 'Avengers'.  A must watch if you plan to see the 'Avengers'.  Otherwise you may be a little lost going in.

Marvel is finally making Fanboy's dreams come true.  Thank you Marvel, now if only DC Comics could get it's act together and give us something besides 'Batman' and 'Superman'...

4577262,4,B0055EAJ7A,"In the realm of Asgard dwell a race of aliens who inspired the Norse myths. A millennia ago, they fought a war against the frost giants, defeating them and forging an uneasy peace. When a frost giant raiding party attacks Asgard, Odin dismisses it as a one-off incident whilst his son Thor demands a warrior's response. When he disobeys his father's command and launches a counter-raid on the frost giant homeworld, Thor is stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth, leaving his brother Loki free to rise to power in Asgard...

Of the Marvel superheroes headed for the big screen, Thor was always going to be the hardest sell. Whilst the other Marvel heroes are (mostly) humans who have gained their power through science, technology or mutations, Thor is an alien from another world who dresses up like a Lord of the Rings character, intones rather than speaks and whose answer to everything is overwhelming violence. Marvel made an excellent choice in bringing in Kenneth Branagh to direct the movie. A Shakespeare actor and director of long standing, Branagh embraces the movie's crazy concepts and over-the-top theatrics with all the relish of a director jumping head-first into A Midsummer Night's Dream and brings real flair to many of the scenes. Most notably, he does not balk with either the action sequences or the CGI-heavy scenes and pulls these off well.

The movie's depiction of Asgard is a notable part of its success, with the realm depicted as a colourful and weird world of retrofuturistic buildings, rainbow bridges and people who have never heard the word 'camp' walking about in gleaming golden armour. The casting of its residents helps a lot with this, with Sir Anthony Hopkins bringing requisite gravitas to the role of Odin and Chris Hemsworth making for a likable Thor. Tom Hiddleston is excellent in the role of Loki, bringing charisma to what could have been a one-note villain. Idris Elba also does great work in the very small (but crucial) role of Heimdall. As well as having the most ludicrous costume in the film (this is saying a lot) and some of the most portentous dialogue, he is also saddled with dubious contact lenses, but is never less than 100% convincing in the role. Thor's band of adventuring companions is well-played (and it's always great to see Ray 'THIRTEEN!' Stevenson on screen) but under-used. Similarly under-utilised is Colm Feore as the king of the frost giants, who is appropriately menacing but barely appears.

For the Earth characters, Natalie Portman is also solid as Jane Foster, but her character lacks real development in the film. In fact, she degrades from an intelligent physicist into a two-dimensional love interest over its length, which is disappointing. Outside of a few decent one-liners, Kat Dennings also gets little to do as Darcy Lewis, to the point where she seems to have no point in the movie. Stellan Skarsgard is better-served as Eric Selvig (rather better than Portman, as he carries over to The Avengers) who gets a few good scenes, most notably when he and Thor get drunk in a bar. Most surprising is Jeremy Renner, who unexpectedly shows up for five minutes as an archer and then vanishes, which will likely confuse casual audiences but delight hardcore Marvel fans (as will Clark Gregg, returning from the Iron Man movies as Agent Phil Coulson).

The film ticks along nicely with some good pacing, and the script does a good job of mixing up the Marvel universe and Norse mythology whilst trying to anchor the Earth scenes in some kind of reality. Considering the potential for the movie degenerating into a confused mess, it's impressive it turned out as cohesive as it has. Unfortunately, there are some issues. Thor losing his powers so he is actually in danger on Earth is a lazy plot device, whilst the Destroyer is not a particularly engaging enemy. There's also a dearth of good female roles, with Portman's role being predictable and Dennings's being pointless. Jaimie Alexander is better-served as Sif, but is still relegated to the supporting cast. The script also arguably does not adequately explain why Thor offers to ally with SHIELD, given that SHIELD's portrayal for most of the movie is not particularly flattering.

Still, Thor (***) is enjoyable in a gloriously over-the-top, bonkers way. Some underserved actors and dubious plot points notwithstanding, it's a reasonable slice of entertainment. The movie is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1336003200,3,4479,4.958721704394141
4577263,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I received this set as a gift from my parents, unsuspecting that I would be blown away by the story and visual effects.  Put simply, Thor is an epic masterpiece that stands as a great movie in and of its own.  A newly-discovered Chris Hemsworth, briefly seen as impromptu Captain George Kirk in 2009's reboot of Star Trek, fills the lead role of Thor with impressive talent.

Also a fan of Star Wars, I found Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker to be a little soft, especially in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (though for the record, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie).  I mean, c'mon, this guy was supposed to become the ULTIMATE bad guy 30 years in the making.  Instead of seeing what we were to believe was a noble warrior gone rogue, we were treated with a whiny, sniffling, bratty kid who ultimately served as a real letdown in the end.  THIS was Darth Vader?!?  Hemsworth's acting convinced me that if he were to have been given a lightsaber that he would have more than adequately filled the role that Hayden Christensen should have manned up to.

Chris Hemsworth portrays Thor as a god who is stripped of his power and forced to live the cold, harsh reality of humanity.  Does he demonstrate weakness and humility that characterizes his human counterparts?  Absolutely, albeit with a noble demeanor.  The audience can feel the emotional pain along with Thor, thanks to Hemsworth's talent.  However, the feeling he gives the character far surpasses that of a whiny, bratty little kid.  George Lucas would have done MUCH, MUCH better to have cast Hemsworth as Sith protege.  Darth Vader would have been a much more believable character evolution were this the case.",1335830400,2,1686,4.768965517241379

4577265,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Marvel's first and most successful release of 2011 was Thor, directed by noted-Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh and starring newcomer Chris Hemsworth. There was a lot to like about this movie. I thought the relationships were a strong point, as were the characters themselves. Tom Hiddleston had a tough role as Loki, but he managed to make the villain sympathetic and there was a nice mix of love and jealousy between him and Thor. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) added a lot of humor and it was nice to see a female friendship showcased in a superhero film.

Sometimes the scenes in New Mexico dragged a little, but not terribly. Thor was certainly fun, but there was nothing that made me love it.  It did, however, increase my excitement for The Avengers.",1335484800,,778,4.842105263157895

The story itself is very good.  Much like Bryan Singer, Director of X=Men and X2 stated after the wide critical acclaim of X2 stated, ""X2 is the movie I really wanted to make, but I had to make X-men first so that the second one would make sense.""  The same is true here. Actually, with HULK, CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN, and now THOR we have entire movies of backstory for these heroes for the coming movie AVENGERS.

Thor is great.  We learn of his home, why he comes to earth. Yada yada.  Typical hero story, loses powers, regains them, kicks ass, special effects blow your mind.  It is totally worth a watch before the AVENGERS movie this may.  A used widescreen copy on DVD watched on a blu-ray is just fine and very cost conscience.",1335484800,,928,4.30635838150289

I thought the actor that played Loki was good also. I thought it had some funny scenes wich I liked because it wasn't serious the whole time. I liked the parts when he was on earth better than the Asgard scenes so I didn't like the first 35 minutes or so of the movie that much until he landed on earth and then the movie really picked up.

4577271,5,B0055EAJ7A,"VERILY! I saw this in the theatres with my daughter. I've corrupted her into a geek pretty much, and so she was all about seeing Thor on the big screen. What a film! When kenneth Branagh was picked as director I said ""Well of course he is!"" His Shakespearean background would be perfect for the Asgardian God and his realm! I must say I'm glad I was very right! This is a very good movie, and adds to the Avengers stable of chracters with true Godly power. Hemsworth nails the part as Thor, and Hiddleston's Loki is suitably devious, but here we actually see why and it all works very organically. Hopkins as Odin the Allfather was absolutely brilliant. The film moves along a a good pace, and though it slows down a little in the middle it does pick up again at the end. i would say that's my one gripe. After the opening battle scene with the Frost Giants, the other action set-pieces just don't feel as strong. That said it's still a great film and worth the purchase. Also the Marvel One-shot ""The Consultant"" starring everyone's other favorite S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson, who is featured in Thor as well, is worth the purchase too. I currently own 3 of the 5 Avengers related Marvel films on Blu-ray and have to get the other two to complete my collection (I have Iron Man and Incredible Hulk on DVD).

Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega-pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn.

Both leads Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, were excellent but it was Tom Hiddleston playing Loki that made the movie for me.  I could not take my eyes off him, his performance was mesmerizing.

Both actors were touching, and brought tears to my eyes because the brother's personalities grew in opposite directions.  At first Thor was arrogant and bad, while Loki seemed humble and good, but those roles completely reversed by the finale of the movie and yet I couldn't hate Loki and found myself saying along with Thor, ""Loki no"", when Loki did what he did (I don't want to give it away).

The CGI and the costumes are great and so are the fighting and action scenes too.

Also, some of the best scenes were cut and are in the deleted scenes section of the Blu-ray disc.  Especially the part where Loki is made King (he didn't steal it, it was bestowed upon him according to the line of succession, but by cutting the scene out of the movie it appeared as though he stole the title).

I'm looking forward more to Thor II's release (probably in 2013), rather than the Avengers movie that will be released this summer.  Although Thor and Loki are in the Avengers movie I can only imagine it will be the usual Marvel fare, unlike Thor which is the exception.

The worst part was waiting for the blue ray to be released so I could watch it when ever I wanted. The casting was wonderful and it was like the characters jumped from the two dimentional comic to the big screen. Not only was the movie well scripted and cast, it also served as a life lesson of how one lives their life and how they can change for the better. This was a fine message for all ages.

4577300,5,B0055EAJ7A,"What I liked best about ""Thor"" was how the writers of the movie chose to approach the existence of these ""gods of Asgard"", treating them as extraterrestrials that the primitive cultures of Norway mistook for immortal deities. Therefore, the entirety of Norse mythology was created as a result of the visitations from these alien beings. As I'm not a huge comics fan, I'm not sure if this is consistent with canon of the comic book, or a deviation, but I think it was a really smart idea. Granted, the entire plot requires a massive suspension of disbelief... but if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't be watching a movie based on a comic book about Odin, Thor, and Loki ;)

But with all the insane sci-fi and supernatural occurrences in this movie, the part that's the most difficult to swallow is how quickly Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman) fall in love. After just two days, they are HEAD OVER HEELS in love. I'm talking about ""I'll go the ends of the universe for you!"", tears-in-my-eyes, kind of love. Maybe if they were teenagers, but these are two grown adults! It's pretty silly, and I tease, but all kidding aside, the actor who plays Thor does a great job, and so does Natalie Portman. Also surprisingly good is Anthony Hopkins... I mean, I know he's a great actor, but to pull off the role of Odin? I should have known better than to doubt him J

I remember watching the Thor cartoons as a kid and reading the comic books, so its interesting to see how the characters were brought to the big screen. I also appreciated that it wasn't just one fight scene or violent occurence after the next, although there is plenty of that for your 11 year old boys (the kids visiting LOVED it and it kept them quietly entertained).",1327708800,2,459,4.348837209302325
4577311,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I waited a long time to watch this one.  I was expecting some clich super hero movie with the usual cheap thrills.  Not the case here.  The story really helps this movie be great.  I love how Thor is humbled when everyone knows he is the strongest and the most cunning of them all.  But he was far too arrogant and ill-considered to be handed the throne.  During his humiliation as a human being, I had several laughs, especially the scene in the hospital!  Thor was also well casted.  Everyone played their role well.  There are MANY super hero movies out there right now, and this one DEFINITELY deserves your attention.  Give it a try.  Most people will like it.  I'll be getting it on blu ray pretty soon!

<NEWS> Thor will be making another appearance in the movie ""The Avengers"", which comes out this summer in theaters (2012).  And I've read that they are working on a script for ""Thor 2"".

Not only did it keep my attention for the entire length of the film with good special effects, great acting (Natalie, Anthony, Chris, and Tom), and decent superhero story, but there were several funny moments that make it unique.  A couple examples without giving anything away but to look out for are the multiple car incidents and the coffee cup scene.  I'm a big fan of Marvel comics so I can be critical of the translation to movies, but this movie was done with justice.  As a result, I have added Thor to my elite DVD collection.  I look forward to Thor 2 and the Avengers.",1327449600,2,721,4.515384615384615

4577316,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor the Norse god Thunder is banished from Asgard to earth for his arrogant and intolerable behavior.  His actions have restarted an ancient war but he is not the problem, it is the evil Loki the god of mischievous deeds and evil who is the real culprit.  While Thor (Chris Hemsworth) tries to live among humans he befriends Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) a mortal human and is forced to defend Earth as Loki's evil forces invade as part of the plan.

This movie is an excellent story from the comics of Marvel and brings to life the ancient god and hero as he renews his power and glory to be restored among the most noble of Asgard.  Thor must face his past faults and become a true hero if he is to successfully regain his place.

The special effects and battle scenes are wonderfully done and the ice monsters are scary and help to make the evil doers seem to be a powerful and evil opponent.  This is not the strongest movie of the comic book genre but it is an entertaining and fast paced action movie.

Loki (Tom Hiddleston) gives a strong performance and helps make the movie more interesting and provides an evil doer who tries to gain control of Asgard.  I enjoyed this movie and I believe you will too!",1326758400,,1213,4.408071748878924

4577319,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I liked this one. It's one of a handful (so far) of superhero/comicbook adaptations that are actually good. This origin story for Marvel Comics' ""Mighty Thor"" has a decent script, good special effects and a simple story arc, with a beginning, middle and end that (hooray!!!) doesn't try to pack too much into one movie. We meet our hero, he faces difficulties, discovers who the enemy is, and defeats them, with modest character growth along the way. Although the bad guy is beaten, they aren't explicitly killed right off the bat (as in so many other super-movies) and by an large the original Thor scenario is preserved from the comic book format.

There is some minor tweaking of the Thor and Jane Foster characters (he's not stuck magically switching bodies between the disabled, mortal Donald Blake, and she's a feisty modern career gal, not a wimpy, lovelorn nurse) and although I didn't sense tremendous chemistry between the lead actors, I'm okay with the retconning of their characters: the old '60s soap opera was one of the elements that made the original ""Thor"" comic a bit dull. This is a welcome change of pace.

Most of all, I appreciate the simplicity of the script, as well as the genuine humorous beats and groovy special effects. I also like that this is a superhero movie that was consciously made to link into another film (""The Avengers"") later on, with plot continuity and room to leave a few loose ends dangling. What kills all the other super-movies is the perverse urge to cram everything in all at once - tell you too much and kill off major bad guys in order to give us a big Hollywood ending. We don't want that: we want The Joker and Loki and Magneto to come back a bunch of times and make life miserable for our heroes. That's how these things work. And, that's what they did in this ""Thor"" film. Kudos. Hope they can get Kenneth Branagh and his crew on board for the sequel or sequels. They did good. (Axton)",1326585600,,1940,4.604046242774566
4577320,5,B0055EAJ7A,"It's a rare movie that provides a sense that every scene is done perfectly. I think Branaugh did that here. I thought it far superior to the Spiderman, Bat-man series that it has been compared so negatively to. It has the ability to merge the two worlds (the super-hero world of Azgar with our contemporary Planet Earth) in a fun way - with Natalie Portman effortlessly showing why she's an Award-winning talent. I thought she had great chemistry with Hemsworth, and Tom Hiddlestone almost steals the pic in one scene with Anthony Hopkins along the way. There is the cutting back and forth between the two worlds in a fun way with a fascinating plot. The cast is winning with Hopkins shining, the effects are some of the best, and I thought the hero earning his way back in the manner done was feel-good and fun and the dialogue between the brothers well-written and the fight scenes unusual and also well done. Idris Elba (The Wire) did all he could with what was given him, and could well emerge into a next level dramatic presence if given the proper role.",1326499200,2,1059,4.578947368421052
4577321,3,B0055EAJ7A,"The film opens in a realm and/or planet far removed from Earth and human existence. We're given a brief overview of the major events in its history and then we're introduced to its royal family battlefield conqueror, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). After disobeying his father, Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is banished to Earth and stripped of his godlike abilities.

  Enter Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not-so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth.

  I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least. The ""earthlings"", are good enough as are those from Thor's home planet and the story is about what I expect. It's not amazing, it's not awful. Basically, it's just a good time at the movies.",1326499200,,1275,4.990566037735849

4577323,1,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was just plain bad for lack of a more colorful word and it missed the mark utterly and pathetically on all accounts and then some. Thor is absolute, computer generated, cgi-visual eye candy garbage of the premium kind. I had to finish it in three sittings because I couldn't get through it in one. The plot is unbelievable (even for a fantasy super hero movie), the acting lousy, and I mean LOUSY, even by Portman, and Chris Hemsworth seems to have OD'ed on the steroids or something as apparently all that brain mass seems to have wandered into his muscles the size of tree trunks, leaving him a vacuuous moron who is the intellectual equivalent of a Disney cruise.

Everything in this movie is so painfully right on formula it makes you wanna puke. I could imagine the briefing the director and writers must have had with the studio execs who were rubbing their hands with greed, ordering them to seek out high profile stars (Portman, Hopkins) and some patny creamer of the season so as to put together an ensemble for a movie they can then boost up with immense cgi shots to generate huge profits at the box office. This movie was created by the marketing department. Ok the acting wasn't just bad, it was embarrassing for everyone involved. Portman and Hopkins must either really be hurting for money or just like the producers must have found a very easy way to secure astronomic salaries doing substandard projects. I guess a 50 million dollars a year income is just not enough for Portman.

The story itself is so dumb and cheeky and uninspiring, not to mention comatosely boring. No twists, no surprises, no intelligent conversations or thoughts - just trite cliches and banalities delivered right on time with lousy acting and predictable all the way. The ""love story"" was dumb and totally unbelievable as well. I don't see how these people could fall in love. They never exchange one intelligent sentence. Their ""conversations"" consist of Thor grunting a line, flexing his muscles or reciting some dumb poetic line shoved into his face by the writers, and which I doubt Hemsworth even understands, and Portman looking all dreamy and concerned. This was like watching a bad Michael Bay rip off. I genuinely fail to understand all the good reviews as objectively really this was a bad movie in every way possible. The only reason I can recommend to anyone to waste their time on this piece of junk is to see for themselves just how truly bad it is. I thought I had seen my share of lousy movies but this one tops the list. If i could give it zero stars I would  - but even that would be too generous.",1326326400,11,2619,4.627956989247312

4577328,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Not Natalie Portman's best role, but not her worst, either. Best super hero movie in the world? Maybe not, but it's a witty, action-packed movie the whole family can enjoy. Unlike a lot of movies rated PG-13, after viewing it, I felt it was safe enough to let my 7 year old watch with the family. Not a lot of harsh language, fighting but no spurting blood, etc. No sex other than a 15 seconds of a shirtless Thor and a kiss towards the end. Nothing risque in terms of sexual innuendo, drugs, etc. Not even grown up jokes found in some children's movies which go over the kiddies' heads.

Although I've described this movie as mild in terms of adult content, it's not a bore. I'm reviewing this as someone unfamiliar with the series, etc. So, with no back ground other than who Thor was in mythology, I didn't find the movie too predictable. Some movies are great, but you're not likely to want to see them again anytime soon.

The film has great cinematography and the wardrobe and sets blend with the CGI to make the world believable. The story is compelling and the acting WAY above what I expected. Of course Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin but I never saw Tom Hiddleston coming as a brilliantly manipulative Loki. The lead Chris Hemsworth fits the bill as action hero who catches us off guard with his humor. He also has a couple of heartfelt moments with Natalie Portman whose Jane Foster finds more depth in this one film than Padme did in 3 Star Wars flicks.

4577333,4,B0055EAJ7A,"A good job with a difficult property. Having to establish the villain and set up some plot elements for the Avengers movie besides telling Thor's story made it an even more daunting task. An impressive job, though not a great movie. The obviously post-converted 3-D didn't help any; making the movie dimmer and less sharp that it would have been in a 35mm film presentation and creating odd post-conversion digital 3-D effects. I may try to catch it on film to see if I like it better in a good sharp 35mm presentation than in the degraded digital presentation I saw.

And doesn't Asgard look a whole lot like the Emerald City (but in boring gold)?

Update: I saw Thor again on film and it looked very good. I enjoyed it a lot more.

The end credits, which were obviously created for 3D after the decision to post-convert the rest of the movie to 3D, are the only time 3D was used to good effect and the rest of the movie looks SO MUCH better on film. I hope that the DVD and Blu-Ray presentation looks more like the film than the digital theatrical presentations.",1325462400,,1064,4.446153846153846

The legend of Thor calls for big and grand anyway, but then you throw in Mr. Branaugh and his team and you wind up with a movie that some thought was too melodramatic.  I loved it, but it's not a typical superhero movie.  Thor isn't wisecracking all the time, he doesn't have amusing sidekicks next to him nonstop, and the love story isn't anguished.  Natalie Portman plays a competant, spirited, scientific Jane Foster (rather than the paramedic like the cartoon) and has some friends along for the ride who provide some laughs, but the majority of the story is fairly serious.  The visual aspects of the film are great, and it's a film I can watch multiple times because of the quality of the story.  And yes, for all you skeptics out there, I will admit that Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman make a very good looking couple that doesn't hurt the watchability of the film either.  :)  It was a no brainer for me to buy but it's not for everyone.",1325376000,7,1054,4.481675392670157

4577337,4,B0055EAJ7A,"With ""The Avengers"" due for release in 2012, there might have been a temptation on the part of Marvel Films to not be thorough with the two releases of 2011, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".  The first of the two releases...did much to eliminate that line of thinking.
  ""Thor"" plays well on two levels--as a story of intrigue and betrayal among Norse Gods, it seems as if it is ""Hamlet"" on steroids; but carries some moments of surprising humor and pathos.  The humor strikes many who have known the Marvel character as surprising--after all, Thor and the fellow Asgardians have been primarily known for their Elizabethan English (The usage of ""thee"" and ""thou"") and Thor's own rather severe nature.  Which is why credit must be given first and foremost to Kenneth Branagh.  Branagh has certainly had a history with The Bard's works, having directed ""Henry V"" in 1989 and ""Hamlet"" in 1996.  Certainly the Asgard part of the story--Thor's ascension to King of Asgard subverted by his half-brother Loki, and Loki's ascension to Odin's throne--plays as a Shakespearean tale...
  But the earthbound part of the story--Thor's banishment to Earth, developing his relationship with the astrophysicist Jane Foster, and learning that a true leader will make sacrifices for the greater good--comes in a part of the tale which is at points humorous (If not laugh-out-loud funny), touching...almost endearing in many ways; while mixing in the action that superhero movies have to have.
  Branagh mixes both elements of his Shakespearean training and more traditional leanings quite well here, and creates a very good introductory story.
  Of course, it helps that the cast doesn't sleepwalk this out.  Chris Hemsworth pulls a magnificent double in this movie (For that matter, Hemsworth and his wife--Elsa Pataky, who played the Brazilian police liasion to Dewayne Johnson in ""Fast Five""--probably rolled in a bunch of money this past summer).  Hemsworth captures a headstrong, willful, quick-to-anger warrior at the start; when cast out of Asgard without his powers he comes off as arrogant and spoiled--and maybe a little bit touched--but grows in the story.  But Hemsworth also provides charm and a pretty good gift for physical comedy that enhances the characterization.
  Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It is a brilliantly nuanced character that plays all sides against each other for his benefit, but Hiddleston gives the character a unique soul--angered at his origins and feeling deprived of his birthright, and willing to take out his anger on both his Asgardian family and the Frost Giants.
  Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo bring regality and power to Odin and Frigga--it is particularly nice to see Russo back at work after about a ten-year absence...Stellan Skarsgard plays Erik Selvig with a bemused look, but honest concern for Jane Foster; and Kat Dennings is a riot as Darcy Lewis.  Among Thor's fellow warrior gods, Jaimie Alexander's Sif is a delight--she seems to lead the Warriors Three (Including Ray Stevenson's Volstagg--Stevenson seems on course to become a member of ""The Mighty Marvel Movie Players"", people who have done different roles in Marvel movies, since he played Frank Castle in ""Punisher: War Zone...).
  Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is notable..touching, and brilliant.  Given that it follows her dark turn in ""Black Swan"", Portman has to call on a lightness and humor that hasn't been seen much with her.  Her Jane is a brilliant woman with a bad dating history, and when she has Hemsworth's Thor drop out of the sky onto her RV, she's a little overwhelmed by the mystery and the slightly imperious (Though charming) behavior.  The key sequence of the movie--when Thor proves himself a hero worthy of Mjolnir, the mighty hammer--is Portman at her best; sad at Thor's initial sacrifice to The Destroyer, but her shock at what happens when the hammer returns to Thor--her ""Oh...my...god??!?"" is priceless, as is her comments about Thor's usual clothing after defeating The Destroyer.  To paraphrase that line, Jane is a good look on Natalie.
  Notable among the special features is the ""one-shot"" where Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, the SHIELD operative from the Iron Man movies does a little manipulating in a side-story (Which also explains a scene from ""The Incredible Hulk""...).
  Again, Marvel Films could have been very sloppy with this story, figuring that nothing really counts until the summer of 2012.  But Kenneth Branagh didn't allow that, Chris Hemsworth couldn't allow that, and Natalie Portman wouldn't allow that.

Wouldn't the whole movie just come across as cheesy to mature movie-goers?

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie came across as much better than I had expected.

4577343,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I watched Thor and Captain America back-to-back and I think Thor was better.  I'm not saying it was ""good"", just better than Captain America.  SPOILERS.

Thor is basically your classic Cain and Abel story.  Odin has two sons... one good and one bad.  Thor and Loki.  One tries to kill the other... you know, the usual stuff.  Does it matter that this is inconsistent with Norse mythology - guess not...

Stick with me here - I expected less from Thor in terms of plot because the entire concept was wrapped up in Norse myth and legend.  On the other hand, Captain America was a story about soldiers in WWII.  Given the context of each story, I'll give Thor a little more wiggle room in terms of plot details making sense or not.  The whole story is more ""fantasy"" in the first place.

The only part I found myself really questioning was when Loki travels to Earth to visit Thor while he is being held captive.  How does he do that?  Where does he come from?  Is he Puff the Magic Dragon or something?  Why doesn't anyone see them talking or hear them talking?  How does Loki get back afterward?  One minute ""Poof"" he is there... the next ""Poof"" he is gone.  Did he use the magic stargate thing?  Obviously not because everyone would notice the giant tornado of clouds and light coming down out of the sky.  Soooooo?????

You know what this sequence reminded me of (of course your do)?  It reminded me of the part in The Matrix when Cifer meets with the agents and plots his betrayal.  Wait - how did Cifer get into the matrix to do that?  Someone has to jack him in.  Someone has to monitor him while he is in the matrix.  Soooo... how does Cifer get in and talk to the agents?  It makes no sense.  He can't.

Same thing here.  Unless Loki got beamed down from the Enterprise, there is no way he could have just appeared and then disappeared.  There is also no way he could have run around the complex without being noticed -  unless he can stop time or something... which he can't... and even if he could he obviously didn't.

Sorry - this stuff just really irritates me.  Hollywood spends million of dollars to make these movies and no one asks these questions?  Are you telling me that none of the producers or actors stopped for a minute and said ""Hey wait a minute... how does Loki just appear like that?  That doesn't make sense...""  Doesn't that happen?  Isn't there someone checking this stuff for consistency?  On the other hand, perhaps the directors, producers, actors, etc just don't care.

I sort of thought the same thing regarding the fact that Loki was really a frost giant baby that was adopted by Odin.  Apparently, Odin can touch frost giant offspring and make them look human?  What?  Is this some sort of Midas touch that turns monsters into Norwegians or something?  So Loki is a frost giant, but doesn't know he is a frost giant, but when he figures out he is a frost giant he suddenly learns to use frost giant powers?  Huh?

Well, the penultimate question here is where is all of this going?  Obviously Thor's Earth woman is going to use her research to recreate the wormhole, right?  I suppose that will happen in the upcoming Avengers movie - guaranteed to be lame btw.

Oh!  Almost forgot!  What's up with the Shrike?  Is that the Shrike running around and blasting people with its face?",1324512000,,3315,4.465661641541039

4577345,4,B0055EAJ7A,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I saw ""Thor"" on Monday, May 16, 2011 and I was generally pleased. Consequently, I should forget filing a future Mensa membership application. So be it. The movie probably lacks that precious moralistic profundity the Academy Award Committee purports to seek in its cinematic viewings. Nevertheless, I found it intelligent, competent, engrossing, AND respectful of its source material - namely Stan Lee's interpretation of Norse Mythology.

""Thor"" is not a mindless fantasy romp. It addresses various themes such as simmering sibling rivalry, filial fealty, overweening presumption and haughtiness that comes with power, resentment, self-sacrifice, and the wisdom of self-restraint. The overbearing, overreaching warrior Thor is thrust upon the road to humble self-redemption, and what better place to do so than upon an unassuming New Mexico hamlet on Midgard. Perhaps a tad too quickly (but that's all right), he learns of a warrior's, a god's, a being's true worth - forgiveness (of Loki's tortured treachery) and self-sacrifice (to protect Jane, her friends, and the New Mexico town) from the Destroyer juggernaut. In short, I found ""Thor"" ultimately uplifting.

Flaws do exist. Occasionally the luscious, staggering Asgardian and cosmic backgrounds seemed like scale-model work. Thor becomes acclimated to Midgard customs a bit too easily; more ""Fish Out of Water"" encounters would have rectified this. Some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. security personnels' behavior was implausibly lenient. Nevertheless, ""Thor"" serves as a more than adequate introduction to the God of Thunder and Lightning, the devious but surprisingly conflicted God of Mischief and Evil Loki, the imperious but circumspect Asgardian lord Odin, the Asgardian dimension (NOT planet) and the richness of Norse mythology. It takes itself seriously enough, but not too seriously, because it's a rollicking, energetic adventure, too.

Furthermore, the very last end credit whetted my appetite for ""The Avengers"" movie. Overall, ""Thor"" is a quite satisfactory accomplishment.",1324425600,4,2077,5.690322580645161

4577347,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I've enjoyed most of the Marvel movies very much, but this is my hands down favorite, not only among the Marvel movies, but I mean this is my favorite movie period. I can't say enough about the costumes, the casting, the beauty of Asgard and the soundtrack. Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Odin and since seeing the movie in May when it opened, I have not been able to get his version of Odin out of my head when I read the comics. Chris Hemsworth is perfect physically and in his performance. The rest of the cast is awesome, too, but it would be impossible to say in words how absolutely PERFECT Tom Hiddleston is as Loki. That is the most brilliant casting ever. He brings so much depth to Loki. For me, he makes the whole movie.

My only complaint about the blu-ray is that it just doesn't have enough bonus stuff on it. I was hoping it would have much, much more in the way of bonus stuff. The deleted scenes are great, and the featurettes are, too, I just wish there were way more of them. I also wish they would have added a feature about the comic book history of Thor, maybe something about the Norse myths, and way more interviews and features.",1323907200,2,1153,4.313364055299539

It still had moments that were awful such as Natalie Portman's gal pal who is there for comic relief which means demeaning Thor in funny ways. Thankfully, the gal pal is negligible in the film. The film is pretty decent. Agent Coulson and Jeremy Renner's character were bonuses in the film.",1323648000,,382,4.394366197183099

4577353,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Ok here's the skinny, I love the movie simply because ""Follywood"" did not totally screw it up. I am still pissed as all hell about the fact that when ""Follywood"" gets their hands on a comicbook character they think they can outdo the original writers, sorry ""Follywood"" big mistake, it ain't happenning.  Who say's ain't, ain't a word ohh yeah, english majors, but I digress. Part of the reason comics are so popular is that they are very well written and the people who read really don't want his or her characters to messed up via ""Follywood's screenwriters who think they are staying true to the characters or want to put their own spin on a great story. Thor was a great quick shot in to the world of one of Marvels most mistreated characters. We seem to always want to knock down or degrade our demigods, I'm not touching the real deal equation. The movie was definitely cool from a comic book fans perspective, even if there was no Donald Blake involved in the movie. Although his alter ego plays a very pivitol role in the comics until the year 2000,, and while Jane Foster was not a nurse all is forgiven. I came in to the movie not seeing a single trailer on purpose, as I have read and own about 75% of the Thor comics Marvel has produced. I have been reading them since he first ran in to the Hulk, back in Journey in to Mystery issue 112, and then I got in to Norse Mythology. So I am what Marvel would have called back then a ""True believer"" or Merry Marvel Madman.  I loved the visuals, the timing was almost flawless and for an actor who was pretty much unknown to most Americans I think he did a really good job, and as always I wanted most special effects , especially when it came to what the hammer is actually capable of doing. I would dare say, that I would like to see another Thor movie this time without  his half brother involved. But as most Most comic book fans of Thor know, that's almost impossible though, but Crusher Creel AKA ""The Absorbing Man"" would be a great nemesis for Thor as well as ""the Celestials"". Hell there could even be a subplot feautring Hercules after all Thor saved ""Herc"" from Zeus's brother Pluto. All in all a well put together effort if not completely accurate by ""Follywood"" So yeah, spend your money, put this one in your archives under the ""Fun, Action, and fantasy section"", it belongs there. It is way better than either Fantastic Four movies which were such a dissapointment to many fans of the books, but that's ""Follywood"" for you, Thos is a great little flick, it's a keeper.",1323561600,,2538,4.418803418803419
4577354,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I only watch these comic character movies for visual effects, and the visual effects in this movie were absolutely breathtakingly stunning.  The realm of Asgard was superbly detailed and the characters seemed ""believable"" there. I did not expect to be blown away by the cinematography. Chris Hemsworth was excellent; Anthony Hopkins, as usual, was wonderful; Loki seemed a wonderful character. (I never read the comic series, so forgive my ignorance as to how the movie compares to the real thing)

  Unfortunately, the ""action"" moved to Earth Realm.  That's where Hollywood is and where every movie has to have trite, boring, boilerplate dialogue.  And a totally UNbelieavable heroine/love interest.  There was no chemistry at all between the two characters, Portman was terrible in this role, and honestly - the movie would have been better without that entire setup because it simply did not work.  Did a different person write and produce the Earth Portion??

I watched this on Amazon streaming video, on a big plasma set and the picture was excellent. I doubt I'd pay to buy the Blu Ray disk. It was worth the $1.99 I paid to rent it, but Portman and the Earth Realm Dialogue really ruined an otherwise fine, fine movie. Would have been 5 stars from me were it not for her and the terrible, contrived earth scenes/dialogue.  I hear Thor will be back.  Perhaps they'll bring Loki back.  But please, oh please in the name of Thor's Hammer do NOT feature Natalie Portman again.",1323561600,,1479,4.895582329317269

Great story, action, acting and Kenneth Branagh did an excellent job directing this movie. Too bad he won't be back to direct the sequel because he seemed to really get the characters.

As far as the 3D goes though, it was pretty FLAT. I'm not a big fan of ""converted"" 3D and this movie is a pretty good example of why. Sure there were a couple of scenes with some pretty good depth, but most of the film was pretty flat.",1323302400,,588,3.983050847457627

The film got all funky at the beginning of the movie and said I had a bad connection for some reason but reset or dinked with it and it went back to normal.  Kind of pricy to get  a rental for three ninety nine though to have it instantly made it worth while for this evening.

I have always been interested in Norse Mythology and while the movie does not follow that precisely I can forgive the small changes that they made. The two major male characters, Thor and Loki, each go through a very thorough development during the movie and by the end you can really understand the decisions that Thor and Loki make. Very well done movie, I would recommend to anyone.",1322611200,,555,4.5049504950495045

I am not a huge fan of some of the actors and am not a Thor comic book fan per se but I like other comic book heroes, sf/fantasy, mythology, and Shakespeare and this story delivered all of that.  Tom H. as a sneaky and clever Loki driven by feelings of inadequacy (I am not a psychologist but there's my take) got my attention and my sympathy and stole the show but Chris H. was a great counterpoint as a sort of simple-minded, golden-boy who has to grow up and deal with troubles he has never had to face in all his charmed life.  The characters and plot had depth thanks to Kenneth B. as director --- had no idea he could take Shakespeare off-planet.",1322352000,,769,4.1824324324324325
4577366,4,B0055EAJ7A,"When I was a kid I read ""Thor"" marvel comics as from the first issue, and in fact these comic books ignited my interest in authentic ancient Norse mythology, which in many ways is more interesting than Greek mythology in my opinion.  So naturally, when ""Thor"" made its debut I had to see it, fearing the worst.  Fear not, this is an intelligently made movie that has a linear plot, excellent special effects, and believe it or not, pretty good acting and character development.  The incomparable Anthony Hopkins as Odin the All-Father adds extra zip to the film.

While the special effects in this one were occasionally a distraction, mostly they support and help make the movie, and provide lots of visual treats.  This one rewards the viewer who has a quality TV or video device because the scenes involving Asgaard and Jotenheim are spectacular.  The ending leaves room for more of ""Thor"" (no spoilers here) and this film shows the potential for even better ""Thor"" films in the future.  Enjoyable and recommended.

4577368,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie single handedly explains how mankind is suppose to represent themselves.  Today guys are worried about being polite, making sure they don't hurt anyone's feelings, and always backing down from any challenge and adversity!  NOT IN THIS MOVIE!  Thor is a prince from another universe where being a true MAN is expected.  After watching this movie, I have extreme urges to go around town displaying my shivilry to all woman, and crushing all men who appose me ( almost like Conan ) just with a touch of class.  This is a good thing, however society these days is full of such wimps, if you say the wrong thing to someone or god forbid you challenge a man to a good old fashin fight where the best man wins, not the best man wins and then the loser attemps to stab, shoot, call his friends or the police and taddle on you for being better then him!  So my conclusion... watch this movie, enjoy it, embrace it, then go to the gym, go get in a fight ( and not a drunk fight ), and then after you win or lose the fight, laugh it off with your opponent and joke about how you never really know someone until you fight them, and gain a friend for life!  A REAL FRIEND! not a fake scared one(s) like you more then likey have now.  AMERICA land of the free, home of the BRAVE!

However: I was unable to watch the Blu-ray and 3D versions of the movie. The movie would play, but there were no voices. And a silent version of a comic book action movie? Not a lot of fun.

My BD player is a Sony BDP-S770. This is the only disc I've had any problems with. I've read some reviews here and elsewhere that say the copy protection makes the discs unplayable on some machines. Thanks for that, Paramount.

4577374,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I watched this movie on a whim, because I was bored, and I kept seeing the one battle scene in a commercial. Wow! The character development in this movie blew my mind. I can't decide who impressed me more: Chris Hemsworth in the transformation from glory seeking, self important, heir to the throne. to humble, cares-about-the-little-people hero. Or Tom Hiddleston as the tortured Loki, who really just wants to be his brother's equal, and struggles to fit into a society where he doesn't belong, without knowing why. The betrayal he feels when learning of his true heritage makes his transition to supervillain easily explainable. The weakest performance in the movie, in my opinion, was Natalie Portman. I have seen her in a number of films, and her performance becomes very...stiff, very fake when it comes to a romantic interest. (Just watch her interaction with Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars movies - it was the most unbelievable romance ever, and fairly creepy) The rest of her performance is....tolerable, but only barely. I would have rather seen Kat Dennings playing Jane Foster, because I think she would have made it more believable. Portman did not give me any reason to think that Thor would have been remotely attracted to her. I was rooting for the Destroyer to blow her up, but sadly, she was never really in danger.",1321747200,2,1338,4.898678414096916

The story line is a classic amalgammation of the Thor comic storylines written for the live-action screen.  The acting is acceptable for most everyone, even the actor who performed Loki, but is was a bit overdrawn.  However, this is a film about gods, hence indulgence is the order of the day.  The quaily of the costumes and the sets was impressive when in Asgard.  And shooting the ""mortal"" scenes in the desert provides an almost trite contrast between the two worlds.  However, the movie held my interest because it operates on a grand scale and the production team pulled it off.  Not bad.",1321488000,,683,4.641666666666667
4577378,5,B0055EAJ7A,"IMO, another hit by Marvel. I'm a bit bias because The Mighty Thor was always my favor comic book. I love Thor and his story lines. I also like that his comics were written with him speaking like a Norseman of old...It was different and set him apart from other Super Heroes.

My 2 biggest worries were how Marvel would make Thor sound, and could they produce special effects that were worthy of the Might Thor. I believe they succeeded in both areas. Chris Hemsworth has not only the physique to play Thor, he had the voice...his accent gives that added touch to Thor. Marvel also succeeded in the special effects at reproducing what we have seen Thor doing in comics and on his short lived cartoon program. Scenes like him spinning his hammer while hovering up in the air looked so real (in the real of the movie).

Lastly, on the BD the 7.1 sound is fantastic! And of course PQ is nothing less than great!

I highly recommend this BD for any who was a Marvel Super Hero fan as a kid, and still is.

It was thoughtful, had good character development, and Hemsworth did a great job as the son of Odin.  I'd say this is the second best lead-in movie for the Avengers film in 2012 (right behind the first Iron Man).

The only major problem with the movie is the fight scene between Thor and the Destroyer--it's way too short.  Marvel also did this with the main fight scene at the end of Iron Man 2.  Are they just too tired at the end of production to make the fight scenes more elaborate and compelling?

Keep an eye out during the end credits for an extra scene.  I can't wait until The Avengers comes out next year.

(remember Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler in the Hulk films? You get the picture) Anyway, I never cared much for the comic book character to begin with and I was hoping that the movie would improve on the blonde-haired beachboy from Asgard. It didn't.

4577396,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is a phenomenal result of source material, strong thematic elements, and amazing set design. Fan of comics or no, the Norse mythology is in your face, and the world suffers not for the god's attentions. Despite the difference in themes and settings, you are caught in the epic-ness and are given just enough time to get carried away with it. And maybe a bit longer for you to enjoy an epic in a quiet New Mexican town.

The characters and plot are point for point stories that have happened in the comics throughout the ages. Arrogant son defies father, younger brother manipulates the favoured son. The most amazing thing happens - it feels real.

While we're along for the ride, the BD contains a number of featurettes from casting to props (esp. the Hammer), make-up, music (my least favourite aspect of the film) and settings. Unfortunately, this series of behind-the-scenes comes across a bit of a forced hand. Stan Lee is featured a bit in the featurettes, and that's awesome. He actually is shown walking and talking alongside the cast and crew. There is an Avengers teaser, which is not really anything special of any sorts. The deleted scenes are, for the most part, not deserving of the cut. The first of these is the best - featuring a close look at the brothers Thor and Loki and their close relationship. You get a real sense of camaraderie between Thor and his fellows (and Sif, too). Personally, I'd throw the lot of them back in the film and suffer the added length with a smile.

Once again, I write this review as listening to the director commentary. So I'll come back and edit for those points later.

For now, the BD is as epic as the titular character himself. That's pretty mighty....",1320537600,5,1712,4.64026402640264

4577403,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor was one of my favorite Marvel comic superheroes growing up so the release of the 2011 film `Thor' was greeted by much long overdue enthusiasm.  While it didn't live up to all my pre-conceived expectations (whatever does?), I found it to be an overall satisfying viewing. ""Overall satisfying""..., what the heck does that mean? Kind of a wishy-washy endorsement but let me add that this was my first viewing assessment. Sometimes you instantly fall in love with a film (which wasn't the case here). However other times an initial lukewarm acceptance of a film may begin to become more fully appreciated several days later, which is exactly what happened to me with this movie.

First Impression: I had been impressed by the visuals from the beginning, particularly the sequences in Asgard, Home of the Gods and the frozen world of the Frost Giants. I also thought Chris Hemsworth lived up to my mental image of the mighty Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. However I found the storyline rather weak and a little bit to comic bookish, particularly the dialogue (imagine that, complaining about comic book dialogue in a film based on a comic!). There just didn't seem to be enough residual `food for thought' in the production to warrant more than one viewing.

Change of Mind: For a movie I thought I was over and done with I surprisingly couldn't get it out of my mind. Images of Asgard, the Rainbow Bridge and the brash and unbridled Thor stayed with me, replaying random scenes from the film before my mind's eye.  By far the most powerful image of them all was the face of Loki. Those haunting eyes, that regal strut and the aura of impending chaos surrounding him was intoxicating. Wow, it took a while but I finally came to the realization that I really loved this film after all. Now I can hardly wait to watch it again!",1320278400,2,1850,4.683076923076923

4577407,4,B0055EAJ7A,"The first Iron Man movie set the bar so high. It's difficult to view another Marvel character movie without comparing it.

I think I'm going to place Thor just above The Incredible Hulk in terms of enjoyment. From top to bottom (so far) they rank: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Incredible Hulk. (I don't count the X-Men movies or Spider-Man as they were made by Fox & Sony)

Thor stars Chris Helmsworth (Captain Kirk's father from Star Trek) as the arrogant god who is exiled to earth where he is supposed to learn some humility. On our planet he meets Jane (Natalie Portman) and supposedly falls in love.

The biggest drawback for me was the humor. There were funny moments that just felt forced. The first time Thor gets tased is chuckle-worthy; when he gets a shot in his butt in order to control him, I start to cringe. When they recreate the fact that Jane hit him with her car, I rolled my eyes.

What I absolutely loved about this movie was the ""villain"". I'm still not sure you could call Thor's brother, Loki, the villain. He is such a complex character in this film. There are plenty of twists and surprises from him as this movie progresses. I thought he was the best part.

Once the movie was over, including the anti-climactic scene after the credits, I felt like I had just watched a placeholder for The Avengers movie. I realize Captain America is advertised with that theme, but Thor just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.

I'd give this movie a B-. Loki was superb. Like The Dark Knight, I was hoping to see more scenes with the villain.",1320105600,2,1558,4.4491228070175435

While Loki is bored and plots and plans to take the throne and with it Odin's power sets in motion a plan to do the very thing.

4577427,4,B0055EAJ7A,"The long awaited `Avengers' project moves forward once more, this time bringing a whole new dimension to the Marvel Universe. From the heavens of Norse legend, comes `Thor'. The God of Thunder awaiting to become the omnipotent leader of the 7 realms is cast out due to his selfishness and left powerless on the planet of Earth. There he has to understand that there is much more to being a God than just sitting on your thrown and getting your way.

For a film that is build around so much grandeur than the past few films linked to this story, I was impressed with how grounded it was. Amongst the action there is excellent character development from a well assembled cast. Chris Hemsworth is truly Thor and the way he portrays the boastfulness is fantastic. Natalie Portman always does a great job and with every new role she brings something different. Tom Hiddleson was a perfect Loki, unknowns always seem to the best when it comes to breakthrough performances. The thing that I loved the most about this film was the fact that it was so relatable and funny. There are some moments that just had me laughing. Kat Dennings while she really doesn't have a significant character has some of the best comic timing in the film and that is what makes her character relevant.

`Thor' is a winner and it was one of the best films that I saw this summer and all the surprises that are thrown into this movie just make me more excited for the day The Avengers assemble.",1319587200,,1464,4.541666666666667

The action scenes are generally able to be followed, and the majority of the graphics are on par with what is being put out today. On the other hand, the plot is not that particularly imaginative, there are scenes where the graphics are sub par, and the characters do not create much of any reason to care about them or their plight. In particular, the chemistry between Thor and Natalie Portmans character is terrible and their interest in each other leaves one wondering where their romance was established. Sure, he's a god. He's super ripped and powerful. But that's about all that I could find as an attraction for Natalie Portman. The dialogue is lacking and quite standard for a hollywood boilerplate script.

I am not one to compare every detail of a 2 hour long movie to a 50 year comic franchise.  As a stand alone movie and introduction to the characters, I thought it worked well.  It was not overly serious and at least the movie got going with some action early on.  A big problem in a lot of these super-hero movies is that you have to create the hero, get the cast of characters together, etc.  While I am not a big CGI fan, the effects here were, for the most part, good and not dark and murky.

4577438,3,B0055EAJ7A,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 30 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 5 around 20%. Almost all OOS effects are short duration during fast moving action scenes. There were only a hand full of flaws in the 3D that I noticed. Most of the in screen 3D was OK with a few scenes being somewhat muted.

All in all, not bad for a post-production (FAKE) 3D film, but don't expect many clearly defined OOS effects. If you watch for the OOS, most of the time you will find yourself thinking; Was that out, or not??? It is easy to see, by the camera work, that this film was never intended to be in 3D.

*** Not a good film to show off your 3D system ***
*** However, one of the better FAKE 3D movies ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4577448,3,B0055EAJ7A,"Branagh's Thor is kinda hard going, and I love science-fiction fantasy when it's brilliantly executed, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Star Wars (the original 3 films).  Thor is pure derivative Hollywood by-the-book script writing.  The acting is television calibre for the most part and the music utterly forgettable.  The best aspects of this flick are the f/x on the planet Asgard.  They are evocative and beautiful.  The earth action is forgettable, and hobbled by a very lame romantic interest in the non-charismatic person of Natalie Portman as Jane.  Her Tarzan (you Jane) is played well by Chris Hemsworth who looks more like and advertisement for Golds Gym than a lead in a major Hollywood production.  But he does well with little.  His brother, Loki, is much more interesting, played by Tom Hiddleston.  But villains always steal the show with a script this weak and sophomoric.

The ubiquitous and versatile Anthony Hopkins is a fine Odin but he spends most of this movie in a coma watched over by Frigga his wife played by the lovely Rene Russo who is utterly wasted in this part.  The other lesser gods are anonymous action hero figures from Diablo II.

Everything about this movie is derivative.  Parts of it reminded me of the great computer game Diablo: Lord of Destruction, mixed up with other computer game imagery.  The earth characters are only half-drawn persons and of no interest at all.  The script lacks humor which is fatal in a comic book story like this.  I remember Tim Burton's Batman films as having that tongue-in-cheek irony that is completely absent in Thor.

Thor was made for the 13 year old market and I fear that any sequels that are spawned from it are doomed to failure.  Pity.
Branagh should stick to Shakespeare, preferably as the brilliant actor that he is.",1319068800,2,1812,4.827922077922078
4577449,3,B0055EAJ7A,"This is one of those small screen background noise films:  the kids can watch it while their parents pay inadvertent attention while occupied with other things and catch a few laughs that are thrown in for them.  Unfortunately, I actually had to watch it in a theatre and was pretty bored for the most part.

THe story is about beings that are in other planes of existence.  You have what were taken as Norse gods, but who are apparently advanced humanoid beings whose magic is their science.  THere are also the ice something or others, who are baddies but held in impotence because King Odin has stolen their frozen fire power source.  So the Norse gods are in a succession battle:  Thor is too arrogant to take over, but his putative brother Loki is untustworthy.  Thus, Odin banishes Thor to Earth and sends his hammer as well, which makes a crater and is unmovable.  Enter a gorgeous and eccentric scientist (N Portman), who discovers him and loves him, of course.  A big fight ensues, Thor prevails while seeing the error of his ways (really, that is a spoiler, but would anyone expect anything different?).  Etc.

The chemistry between Portman and Thor is woefully, even ridiculously, absent.  The god actors are OK, not anything distinguished though.  I also found the jokes that were thrown in to be rather flat, i.e. not funny.  Also, the intrusion of SHIELD, the bureaucratic security group, is botched, kind of between Tea Party comedy at their incompetence to arguing that they are the good guys.  It doesn't work, which adds nothing to the insipid formula.

I first read Thor in 1970 or so and still think it's one of Jack Kirby's best creations. It's nice to see his name on this in spots instead of Stan ""Me! Me! All Me!"" Lee stealing credit from him or Ditko or etc, as has been usual for decades now. It's Kirby's vision that made those books really worth reading, and still is.

This version had me hoping highly, as Branagh's epic-Bard-feel screen rating is usually solid. Sadly, despite some nice moments, I just didn't feel the Thunder God vibe anywhere nearly as much I was hoping to. Hemsworth quite simply doesn't have the gravitas. His acting is abysmal in the first half hour, then gets mildly better; one gets the feeling that Hopkins took him aside and tersely reminded him what acting looks like. Hopkins' Odin is the only role with real edge here, and he gets some strong scenes in. But everyone else left me cold.

Loki was nowhere near the scheming prince of darkness he should be, and Thor's buddies had no real oomph either. Portman and Denning are simply weak at best, and the whole love interest thing was handled poorly; the fireside scene is laughable. They should have had some NKOTB playing in the background.

The effects get better as the film goes on, but Asgaard is in general a huge disappointment. I had to laugh at how they made Valhalla a big suburb; look at how over-developed the whole area is. It looks like LA! Every square inch is built over with huge apartments. So this is what the Norse Gods earn for their bravery? Levittown in space? Ridiculous.

Plus the now-standard quiet dialogue then sudden massive sound effect wall of noise gets worse as the movie goes on; we had to ride the remote the whole movie. Blu-rays need to start coming with a separate non-home theater track for when those of us with neighbors less than a mile away are watching a film after dark. This was simply way too much dynamic range for no real good reason. I used to play electric guitar for a living and even I found this pointlessly loud at moments.

Idris Elba had a good feel for the material and seemed one of the few to really grok the original Thor, even in his minor role. Epic, yet understated. No one else but Hopkins had read the source, apparently. But this is Hollywood, after all. Subtlety is almost a cuss word there in these huge CGI blowouts.

Speaking of which, the effects have some fine moments, the end of the bridge being the best, but in general the good blu-ray transfer made the plastic costumes and sets all too clearly fake at times. This looks good but could have looked SO much better and more non-Hollywood authentic. As with the script, and most of the acting, and even the direction. Frankly, as a director, Branagh is a fabulous actor.

If pecs and abs could act, Hemsworth would be Olivier. But they can't, and he ain't, and as the key to the whole tale he brings this movie down to the realm of merely nice eye candy.

A pleasant diversion, but go check out the Kirby originals again and see how truly epic this tale can really be.",1318896000,3,3041,4.474729241877256
4577465,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor...what can i say about it...it was a good movie I will admit, back when they were on asguard it seemed so peaceful, the development of the ice giants as being these cold hearting being, made you hate them every time you see them, thats whats so good about the movies like this, they make the enemies true enemies, even the people watching start to hate them. at first i thought that Thor was a over heated searching for glory type of hero (yes i know thats how thor is but im yet again new to these movies) later to learn thats just how the Thor is.

4577466,1,B0055EAJ7A,"Oh, how I loathed this incarnation of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's immortal Marvel hero. I have been a huge fan and collector of ""The Mighty Thor"" for many years. Being as such, I longed for the time that special effects would finally bring the odinson to life on the big screen. Anyway, here's my personal feelings towards a film that could have been a thousand times better than the tripe they gave us. Here we go..

1) ""THE ICONIC BATTLE HELMET"". We're teased with it for less than a minute ~ on screen ~ then it simply vanishes, never to be seen or heard from again. Many don't really seem to care. Many still simple accept any bones tossed them. I, on the other hand, ""SAY THEE NAY""! Thor without that iconic helmet is like Superman without his cape, Batman without his ears, or Captain America without his mask. (*I'll save that last comparison for another review*)
Anyway, that really ticked me off. Yet amother example of the directer being ashamed of the source material. It's a glaring fact, especially as a long-time fan ~ that continues to irritate me to no end.

2) Loki is ""THE GOD OF EVIL"". What he ""IS NOT"" is a misunderstood villian (*alla Raimi's Doc Ock or Sandman*) who turns bad through contrived circumstances. Sometimes a villian should simply be born a villian. Loki and Thor have ""NEVER"" been anything but enemies. ""PERIOD""!

3) Heimdel has always been a second banana in the books. Now all of a sudden he's as mighty as Odin himself??? Please. In addition to that, Heimdal's a Caucasian character in the books; not an African. However, what really bothered me with this one was the obvious. Now that they changed Heimdal to a black character, he also had to be at least as powerful as Odin. I found it rascially insecure and contrived. No one is as powerful as Odin in Asgard.

4) I really wanted to see the transformation of Don Blake into Thor. I realize that Don Blake's been out of the comics for some time, but it would have been daring and a sight to see, adding so much more to the storyline. But oh yes, the filmmakers continue to be one dimensional thenmselves.

5) Lady Siff and Thor are lovers in the books. In the film there was nothing. Having a love triangle with mortal Jane Foster and goddess; The Lady Siff would have been very intriguing, and again, added more to the story.

6) Volstagg is one of my personal favorites in the comics. A great comedy relief and fun to watch. In the film he was ""BORING""!

7) Has anyone seen or heard from ""BALDER THE BRAVE""?? He's only Thor's best friend and right-hand man. Alas, thanks to the people behind the Thor movie it's ""where's Waldo"" all over again.

8) Lastly, the 3D sucked big time.

  Anyway, I'm sure to receive tons of hate mail on my review, but really don't care. The film sucked and I'm sorry I went to see it.

P.S. Almost forgot. ""Hogun The Grimm"" simply was not him.",1318809600,27,2861,4.459770114942529

Inconsistencies in the stories, poor special effects, shallow story lines, shallow characters, doesn't have right feel or right power level for the character, etc.  My biggest complaint with the superhero genre was that the Matrix movies were bigger and better than all of them from a ""being super"" perspective, and they weren't even superhero movies.

4577492,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Finally a movie based on a comic book that was based on a day of the week (Thursday) that was based on a Norse god that was based on Norse Mythology.

Thor is one of the latest Marvel movies that is but a piece in the big puzzle that is ""The Avengers"" in which almost every character and their actor from a recent marvel movie reprise their role. Thor has an outstanding cast that features 2 Oscar winners (and a nominee).

The plot isn't that true to the source material but is good enough. Thor, the norse god of thunder, pisses off his father and is banished to earth powerless. There Thor must learn humility if he ever return home.

The special effects as you would expect in such a film, same with costumes. But the scenes of Asgard are magnificent. The movie itself is good but it isn't the best out of the ""Avengers"" tie in movies, it might be the worst but that doesnt make it bad. The Iron Man films and The Incredible Hulk were way better because they stayed true to the comic.

The special features are pretty good:

-Commentary by Director Kenneth Branagh
-A marvel One shot ""The The Consultant"": A short film that takes place between the ending of ""Iron Man"" and the ending of ""The Incredible Hulk"", which shows the events leading up to the ""Incredible Hulk"" end credits scene
-Deleted scenes- with option commentary
-Road to the Avengers: A 2 minute trailer/discussion about the upcoming film
-7 Featurettes:
*From Asgard to Earth: A behind the scenes look at the film
*Our fearless leader: Cast talking about the director
*Assembling the Troupe: A look at the cast
*Hammer Time: Talking about Thor's hammer
*Creating Laufey: A look at the actor and makeup behind the frost giant Laufey
*Music of the Gods: A look at the music
*A Conversation: ""Thor"" co creator Stan Lee talking about the movie

Either way, buy this.

Pros:
-Another piece to the ""Avengers"" movie puzzle
-The cast
-Special features
-Asgard looks awesome
-Special effects are good
-Costumes

Cons:
-They did change too much of the origin
-Not the best out of the recent ""Avengers"" tie in movies",1318550400,,2075,4.619565217391305

I'm getting tired of superhero films. When i was a kid I always wanted to see my favorite comic books on screen. Now, I wish they would all just go away. They're all the same. When I saw the ice creatures and Anthony Hopkins with his throw in ""Lord of the Ringish"" accent as Odin, combined with the ""thees"", ""thous"", and ""nays"" I knew this would be no more than an excuse to show how something this juvenile and superficial would look in 3d.

Thor, himself, is about as hulking and juvenile as Dom in Fast and the Furious, i.e. he exists only to show his big muscles and to fight and to look cool doing it. The first hour of the film is supposed to set up the romance between the Asgardian Thor--whose father emasculated him and banished to Earth--and Natalie Portman who's supposed to be a storm chaser or something, I don't remember. After an hour of getting to know Thor as a human being, he recovers his lost hammer and becomes the god of thunder again and defeats the enemy.

That's what you've got with this movie, and some genuninely funny moments mixed in with the action.

Some of the story telling seems thin in some areas, but the action is pretty consistent and the special effects are fun, adding to instead of overpowering the story itself.

I can see where a sequel could be a foregone conclusion because *spoiler alert* god loses pathway back to mortal girl so there is that whole unrequited love thing going on there, but with the hints of other methods of transport to and from Thor's homeworld, you have to guess that Thor will find at least one of them to get back to Jane...

And this movie did a few things pretty well, while other things could have used some polish, some rewrites and maybe some different direction altogether in some areas. Helmsworth was great as Thor I'd have to admit. The story overall was rushed and I get that there is enough of Thor's back story to easily make two movies (and it is a popcorn movie) but as a comic fan you can only hope for the treatment that it deserves. The love story wasn't developed enough for anyone to care-but that aside--Portman has never looked better. Asgard was interesting but never felt 'real'. The place seemed empty and devoid of a population despite a rather large crowd shot. And the small town where Thor lands in feels a bit to much like a movie set. I also  could have done without the giant metal guy-it reminded me too much of those 50's alien invasion movies-little cheesy.

I'd have to say I'm not sure what I was expecting....Maybe a bit more Braveheart...A bit more Kevin Noland. But all-in-all its not a bad attempt, and while fun and entertaining-- I can't shake the feeling that this film will not age well.",1318377600,,1172,4.549763033175355
4577504,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Like many of my friends, I had written this movie off as just another testosterone-ridden-special-fx-flick for the comic-loving masses.(Ok, I admit, I love comics too). But I was surprised that after 20 minutes into the movie I was actually having a good time! It doesn't try to do anything too ambitious, but what it does do is entertain as a summer movie should. There's lots of special fx and nice battle scenes, and the pacing is spot-on. The subject matter is admittedly over-the-top (with the Norse mythological ties), but the movie doesn't take it too far. It keeps things in the ""awesome-looking"" category rather than the ""campy"" category more often than not. Portman does a good job as the over-enthusiastic scientist and Hemsworth does a surprisingly great Thor performance. Their interaction is just another thing that works well for the movie. If you plan to watch the up coming Avengers movie, you can consider this as required viewing - as it appears one of the key antagonists of the Avenger movie is the same one here. Action is fun, not bloody and overly violent - so I wouldn't have a problem taking a 8-12 year-old to watch this. There are no steamy love scenes either. My one gripe is I wish it were longer.

4577524,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor doesn't stray far from the basic premise of the source material, and like the Iron Man franchise, uses similarly clever writing that attempts to ground its fantasy in something closer to reality. There is sparse, but surprisingly well used humor - even a spot or two of nicely done slapstick.

Thor is a pretty straight forward story of a disgraced son, redemption, dark family secrets, and betrayal. It's done with a nice even pacing. It has enough action to satisfy viewers looking for that, while having some well acted drama that's not too heavy for this type of comic book movie, nor is it so light that it feels awkward or misplaced. I credit Marvel's excellent production and quality control along with Kenneth Branagh's direction. No complaints about any of the casting choices, and even the smallest parts are well acted.

The setting and costumes are vivid and imaginative. When I saw early leaked photos from the set I was afraid that much of the movie would look bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything looked after the movie magic was applied. The score is nothing to write home about, I suppose, but it's serviceable.

I really enjoyed Thor, enough to pick up the Bluray on the day of release. I think it will appeal to a large cross section of movie viewers, enough to make it worthy of your library as something you could pop in to watch with just about anyone.",1318118400,2,1397,4.670731707317073

4577528,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Warning: May contain spoilers

Director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" has a 2011 look, slick production values, and at the same time feels like one of those never-to-be-taken-seriously 80s action fantasy flicks, along the lines of ""Masters of the Universe"" or ""Superman II"".

And like those 80s not-so-greaties, ""Thor's"" storyline is an uninspired snore: In eternal Asgard, Thor acts rashly. Odin disapproves and banishes Thor from Asgard, taking from him his power (Thor's hammer). Thor arrives on Earth. Thor's brother Loki schemes. Odin disapproves of Loki's actions, has a stroke or something, and banishes himSELF into a ""Norse god coma."" Thor befriends a family of earthlings. Loki schemes some more. Thor can't recover his hammer. Thor rescues the earthlings from deadly peril. Odin approves of Thor's act. Thor can finally recover his hammer. Thor fights Loki. The end. Oh, and there are also some frost giants.

No, I never read the Marvel comic, but ""Thor's"" superheroic feats are definitely of the ""boys in their early teens"" variety. The movie is kind of humourous in a goofy way, and not terribly acted, which helps. In fact, the two lead performers, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, are fairly well realized, not dumbed-down characters who show good chemistry; all their scenes together look and feel right. Hemsworth plays Thor totally straight, as haughty and deific as some transcosmic sci-fi overlord might come across, with each of his Jarlsberg-sculpted lines of dialogue wearing its own Asgard style flowing opera cape; and, mercifully, not one stale pop-culture catchphrase comes from between his chiseled jaws. Portman performs her ""amused, weirded-out tolerance mixed with mature, scientific wonder"" with the right balance of gravity and a bit of humour. Perfect score there.

It is in its generic take on a lot of the characters who occupy the story's margins where ""Thor"" loses most of its points, in my opinion. Anthony Hopkins, in the role of Odin, is an outstanding actor, but the character himself is flat. Odin either A.) approves or B.) disapproves of his sons' deeds, and apart from that, he has little to do: another ""stern father"" caricature without nuances or distinguishing personality traits.

That Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is jealous of Thor is established from practically the first scene in which both characters appear. Showing more of an inner battle between Loki's jealous, scheming self and his loyal-to-Asgard self might have created some genuine suspense and drama, but, once again, there's nothing here to surprise the movie-viewer.

The King of the Jotuns (frost giants), played to the hilt by Colm Feore, is appropriately menacing and demoniac, but he comes across as merely Loki's chesspiece, as lacking in self-determinism as a powerful gun, or, say, Thor's hammer. Having an agenda of his own might've generated more suspense among the Thor-Loki-Frost giant triangle of cross-purposes; but again, no surprises here.

And Heimdall (Idris Elba), who ostensibly guards the bridge Bifrost, a bridge between Asgard and other worlds, never appears to actually guard the bridge. Why is the Heimdall character even there, if not to pose some challenge or obstacle, or, in the alternative, to fit key-in-lock into the movie's denouement? He just sort of... is what he is.

The verdict: Is Thor a snore? More than the lore of yore, that's for sure. But if your brain needs a night off, then I say go with it. Hoist a flagon of ale, get hammered and watch this 80s redux; and may the mirth and amusement of the gods be thine.",1317686400,8,3563,5.13103448275862

4577532,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I didn't have faith in Thor before it came out, but I was blown away when I saw it in theaters. I came in knowing that the movie would 1) be very influenced by the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Thor, and 2) would act as the second-to-final tie-in to the Avengers film coming soon, a trend that was started by the Iron Man film in 2008. So the concept of the movie's plot takes half the film to modern-day Earth, and the remaining half takes place in Thor's gorgeous homeland of Asgard. The battle scenes are very well-done, and the acting is just as it should be. It's not utterly incredible but it's not poor whatsoever. And, as with Iron Man and Incredible Hulk, the humor is well-placed and appropriate. The ""culture-clash"" between Thor and the Earth-born humans he comes to befriend is where many of the scenes the film has derives its hilarity from.
However, I feel the problem, if any, is the films relation to the upcoming Avengers film. Unlike the previous Avenger movies--Iron Man 1&2, Incredible Hulk and Cap. America--Thor's primary purpose it would seem is to tie-in to the Avengers instead of having Thor on his own adventure separate of consistent intervention and invasion from SHIELD agents, particularly Phil Coulson's character, who first appeared in Iron Man.
However if that doesn't bother you, the movie should put a smile on your face, even if you know little about Marvel's Thor. I would recommend reading up on him just a little bit on Wikipedia or whathaveyou, and know his more modern iterations within the Marvel comic universe---particularly the Ultimate Marvel version of Thor, aka ""Ultimate"" Thor.
Even without the comic book geek knowledge, this is a fun and fast movie, with fantastic fight scenes, character development, and a great ending.

4577540,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Released in 2011, ""Thor"" is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.

The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).

THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the ""Allfather"" is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.

You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse?

Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.

""Thor"" works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. Then there's the ""fish out of water"" element of Thor exiled to earth and the curious things he does. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure the movie has a comic booky vibe, but that's what ""Thor"" is based on. To dismiss it as a campy superhero flick is grossly inaccurate.

The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.

The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a ""Road to the Avengers"" featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.

FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere. The addition of the Destroyer is a plus

Why is this movie so bad?

I am not a comic book guy, so I can't discuss any narrative issues, but I struggled to keep my eyes open for the last 2/3 of the movie. The story & its characters were weak, and I found the special effects to be bright, shiney, and stuff I saw in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the Dark Knights & X-Men (First Class in particular) and don't understand why these two very successful but different movies aren't setting the pace for those making the Green Lantern, Thor, & Captain America all but unwatchable. I am very nervous about the Avengers.",1317081600,4,894,4.779220779220779

4577544,1,B0055EAJ7A,"This was way different from the comic. Thor is not supposed to remember who he is while he's on Earth (Midgard) If I remember correctly, he inhabits the body of some doctor or scientist but in the movie he knows who he is the whole time. This revolves about Norse mythology so I have no idea why they had a black actor and an asian play Nordic gods. Marvel is notorious for changing the races of characters for movies. Nick Fury gets a pass because he's black in the Ultimates, but older readers who haven't read a comic in decades would be annoyed by this. At least DC replaces a character who is white with a totally different character that is black. I know they did this to be politically correct, but could've used the black and asian actors to be Black Panther and Iron Fist, respectively. This movie doesn't beat the Iron Man franchise. If I want to have Avengers on my movie collection in the future, I guess I have no choice but to get this but I'll wait until it's in the dollar bin.",1317081600,8,993,4.315508021390374
4577545,1,B0055EAJ7A,"Where do I start?  Chris Hemsworth's acting was awful, the set was cheesy, and the writing was childish and predictable.  Even Natalie Portman couldn't save the movie with her over-acting.  Definitely one of the WORST movies I've seen in YEARS!",1317081600,8,244,5.05
4577546,4,B0055EAJ7A,"In Kenneth Branagh's 1995 film ""A Midwinter's Tale,"" low-rent actors labor furiously to stage Hamlet, and one of the funniest subplots involves ""the cuts."" Shakespeare's plays can hold about four hours of story, but modern audiences lack Elizabethan attention spans. But what can be cut, and who the heck do you think you are, editing Shakespeare?

""Thor"" offers the opposite problem -- Branagh must stretch about 40 minutes of worthy story into a summer blockbuster. (Norse gods do not do short subject.) The good half of the movie takes place on Asgard, which is in another galaxy, or on another astral plane, or some such charming nonsense. Thor's father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), rules wisely after having defeated the gods' longtime enemies, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, in a battle which gave Scandinavia its Norse legends and the Tea Party an explanation for the Ice Age.

Then, in a Shakespearean development, Odin must choose his heir between two seemingly worthy sons: the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth, perfectly cast) and the cunning Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When his coronation is interrupted by Frost Giants, who are trying to steal back a holy relic taken from them, the mighty Thor defies his dad and leads a magnificent raid on Jotunheim that shreds the delicate peace Odin had built. For his hubris, Odin banishes the unrepentant Thor to Earth and breaks the bond between Thor and his magic hammer, which lies like Excalibur in the New Mexico desert.

The Asgard part of the movie is first-rate popcorn entertainment, full of terrific special effects and PG-13-level good-versus-evil bashing. In New Mexico, the story flags and is only maintained by the strength of the actors. Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings ably play three scientists who aid the banished Thor. These threadbare characters exist solely for plot development, but Skarsgard is particularly effective as a scientist who was raised on Norse legends, but who gave up those childish stories long ago.

Fanboys who sit through the closing credits will delight in a final scene that explains the real point of this movie, which is to integrate Thor into the Avengers, the gang of Marvel Comics superheroes that includes Iron Man, Captain America, and Green Lantern. Thor falls far short of the bar set by Christopher Nolan's epic ""The Dark Knight,"" but its sights were lower. He may not be Shakespeare's Prince Harry, but Thor deserves a full two hours of story next time around.

Chris Hemsworth plays Thor quite well.  Tom Hiddleston take on Loki is refreshing and the positioning of him as a somewhat tragic figure is inspired.

4577558,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I remember thinking that Thor couldn't possibly be a cool character. He just seemed like such a farfetched and unrealistic part of the Marvel superhero family. He didn't fit in; he was mythology, not Marvel. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimates/dp/0785110828/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimates</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimates-2/dp/0785121382/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimates 2</a>. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Thor. Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor and does the character supreme justice. Kenneth Branagh directs and together the entire cast and crew turn out one excellent film.

For starting a war of the realms in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, Thor is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins), the King of Asgard, leaving Thor's brother Loki as the potential heir to the throne. And something's not quite right with Loki. With the help of mainly Natalie Portman, Thor must find redemption and once again become a worthy defender of Asgard. There's one catch: in Thor's banishment he was stripped of Mjolnir, his all-powerful Hammer that also holds his superpowers.

Much of the movie is spent making a ""good guy"" out of Thor after a relatively rough introduction to his character. In the end it's all worth it, because you're really rooting for him by the film's finale. And the after credits scene suggests that Thor will have no minor part in 2012's Avengers film. So Thor 2011 is a successful and exciting intro the character for events yet to happen in a future film(s).

Joss Whedon is writing and directing The Avengers and I'm not sure whether his plan is to follow Mark Millar's storyline. Personally I hope so. Whedon has done some great stuff in his career and some, well, let's just say not so great. But that's a matter of my opinion and based on the NO votes that I received for my review of Whedon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B000BW7QWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>&nbsp;project, I am perhaps in the minority for worrying about Whedon at the helm. We shall see. In the meantime...see Thor.",1316649600,,2513,5.696
4577559,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This review comes from a long-time fan of comics.  This is one of the very best Marvel movies yet, and Thor had to be one of the hardest comics characters to adapt to film.  I believe they've managed to do such a great job that even people who never really were all that fond of Thor in the comics will really like this movie.  One problem they overcame was the costumes.  The versions they came up with for the film are recognizable, but avoid looking foolish- even Loki's horned helmet.  They neatly side-stepped the ""Donald Blake"" subplot.  They had the wisdom to avoid having Asgardians speak with ""thees and thous"".  They avoided offending viewers (generally) on the subject of ""godhood"", and even got a bit of humor out of it.  And the humor, throughout the film, was done well, and was never forced.  There were pleasant, natural tie-ins with Bruce Banner, Stark, Hawkeye, SHIELD, and Nick Fury.  The set designs were wonderful.  Asgard looks like Jack Kirby with Norse Viking decoration.  The banquet hall looked like Maxfield Parrish painted it, and Bifrost was dazzlingly perfect.  I always wondered what Thor saw in Jane Foster.  Thanks to Natalie Portman, I know now.  Aside from the consideration of being true to its comic book roots, the acting, direction, special effects, wardrobe, cinematography, sound, and music are all consistently top-notch.  HERE FOLLOW SPOILERS!  I loved the way they came up with a visual symbol for the spell Odin cast on Thor's hammer.  The Destroyer was more scary-looking than ever. (And I read his original appearance when I was 12 years old.) Although they didn't explain it in the film, the Destroyer isn't a robot.  It's a hollow, magical suit of armor, activated by and filled with Odin's power.  Using it against the frost giants, then having to charge it back up probably helped bring on the Odinsleep.  Some critics said Thor's change of heart, evidence of an increase in maturity and wisdom, came too rapidly to be believable.  He believed that his careless actions had been partially responsible for his father's death!  He was filled with grief and guilt.  That would tend to calm him down some, I should think.  I was glad that Jane kissed him, instead of him acting like he had some ""right"" to her.  I liked the way you could tell that he was glad that Jane was searching for him at the end.

(1.) Confusing and not clear introduction of who the characters are and what the story is to become.
(2.) Very unimaginative dialogue - stereotypic and sophomoric. So how is it that creatures with technology thousands of years ahead and an unfathomable distance removed should sound and look like 21st century American Hollywood actors?
(3.) Copied Narnia and other fantasy movies with CGI of floating rocking cliffs and ocean/sea water that was too obviously CGI. Same old good god, bad god sibling rivals being sent to Earth and acting more like Neanderthals.
(4.) Worst acting of the year from men-in-black CIA plastic cutouts to, and especially Portman, who spent most of her time acting like a starry eyed teen checking out the bods of her costars. They in turn acted like typical Hollywood's versions of incompetent scientists and godly inhabitants of the other planets could have been better casted in a '30s slapstick flick.
(5.) Costumes that look like plastic Samurai armor with helmeted wings. In fact all the props had that shiny lucite/polyurethane molded look. Typical comic book non-functionality. All the buildings, settings and props had a stylistic overindulgence that only a cloistered comic book artist would think of. And the wormhole device looks like early 1900s art nouveau architecture. This is typical quickly put  stuff together to make a movie without much thoughtful writing & directing.
(6.) Story was a dishonor to classic Nordic myths which have more substance and depth to them than this copycat plot. Horses and lasers and flying through wormholes at multiple times the speed of light and then stop suddenly violates even an elementary student's knowledge of physics. Didn't the writers & director know that the National Academy of Sciences has movie advisors?

  Just watched this with my boyfriend and I am stunned at how good this movie was!  The action is top notch, the special effects are incredible, the man who plays Thor is ripped to shreds (his muscles of course :D ), which is always a bonus if your a chick like me (or a man who swings that way ;) ), and the story is so deep it held my interest the entire time (and that's saying a lot!)!

  I honestly have NO complaints about this movie, I didn't even want to get up to use the washroom while watching it, the story and characters sucked me in and never spit me out!

  If you love a great story, a good amount of action, and enjoy watching buff men fly and kick some serious ass, get this movie, you can thank me later! :)

Much like the first Iron Man during its theatrical run, I had very little, if any, knowledge of this franchise going in. My expectations were set somewhat high by the success and entertainment value of said Iron Man films, but having only seen Chris Hemsworth once ever in any kind of movie and only knowing (not actually experiencing) any of Kenneth Branagh's directorial works I would say I expected to at least be entertained by the special effects and action sequences, if not any more of the small pepperings of Avengers references being thrown in for the eventual mishmash to come in just a year's time. First, I'd like to address the film's setting. On a personal level, I've enjoyed all kinds of genres throughout the years: sci-fi, fantasy, the supernatural, and all other kinds of ""unexplainability."" With that said, Thor pulls off the fantasy element in a surprisingly epic fashion. From the very get-go of the battle against the Frost Giants to the ornately decorated kingdom of Asgard and the lavish costuming of its warriors, I was captivated within minutes. Which isn't to say that the film is all looks. Very much so like the aforementioned first Iron Man, the plot has a strong focus on the ideas of power, humility, and responsibility (something a lot of superhero stories do, but it seems to be a popular style of storytelling, no?). Right before his crowning as new king of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), comes to a point of such vanity and hubris, that his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), strips him of his power and banishes him to earth. And as you can guess, Thor will eventually learn his lesson of humility amongst humans, regain his power, and stop a usurping of his father's throne back in the homeland. Linear plot aside, it's not so much the story itself that manages to impress me, but the way and fashion in which it's told. Coming from quite the Shakespearean background, I would suffice it to say that Kenneth Branagh brings a refreshing kind of Thespian quality to the film's overall atmosphere which, for me, does wonders in terms of the acting, script, and character chemistry. Additionally, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgrd, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Idris Elba give some good performances for what little screen time they have as well. And while the film clocks in at just under 2 hours, it probably could've used an extra 15-30 minutes for some better character development, but oh well.

The film was shot on 35mm but digitally processed, so it should go without saying that the transfer is flawless. A lot of the backgrounds on Asgard and Jotunheim are obviously CG'd, but as a result look absolutely stunning in HD. During it's theatrical run, I only got to see this in theaters on some dinky film projectors (once for the midnight premiere in an older Cinemark that didn't even have stadium seating, then a second time in an AMC with slightly newer projectors but still not near the quality of their digital ones). At any rate, after having the opportunity to sit down and see this in the comfort of my own home and in glorious Blu-ray, I have to say the cinematography is pure perfection. The shots in Jotunheim are particularly dark and as cold as the planet itself, but nary a bit of detail is lost. Black levels are especially well-accentuated and reveal a great amount of depth and delineation from Laufey's jagged and shadowed face down to the little cracks in the ice and even the line texturing of Thor's cape despite all that snow blowing around. When we get to Asgard the film's color scheme is most pronounced with lavish golds, silvers, and bronzes giving off a very shiny look. The lighting tends to feel slightly less natural in order to balance out the contrast for all the computer effects, but nonetheless blend together seamlessly for a very grandiose and ethereal stage design. In fact, a lot of the closeup shots are notably sharp; just look at the hair on the beards of Thor and Odin or the line detail in all the armor. Meanwhile, the shots on earth will probably look the best out of the lot. Aside from whatever visual effects they added in post-production during the action sequences or whatever, everything else in the little New Mexico town is as non-CG as can be and it results in a very fine and crisp picture. Natalie Portman never looked prettier. And if you're a girl, you'll be happy to know Chris Hemsworth's buffness really stands out, too.. Anyway, my favorite shots of the movie are the skirmish on Jotunheim for its incredible blacks and sustainable line detail, then the fight on the Bifrst around the end of the film for its colors and excellent CG integration.

To this point my 3 loudest BDs have been Hellboy II, Casino Royale, and Inception (which even blew out my sub-woofer at one point). Needless to say, I think I've found my new number one by a long shot. I keep reading that people say Thor's sound design / mixing is a little too aggressive for its own good, but I say bollocks. Not only does it make Thor the sonically captivating summer blockbuster it should be but I personally think it fits the theme ""god of thunder"" to a tee. LFEs are easily the best part of the track with booming and thunderous (and literally) ground-shaking rumbles that range from subtle to ""I can feel my butt vibrating."" From the very get-go of Odin fighting the Frost Giants on earth it's a pretty clear cut example of what to expect for the rest of the movie. And when Thor actually gets to Jotunheim to battle the Frost Giants himself its even crazier and louder than that. Discrete effects and separation are there, mind you, but holy crap does the placement and directionality really excel when fights break out. Dialogue stays clear and audible in the center with music and effects being dispersed evenly through the fronts. But my biggest delight is in the fact of how well-placed the rears and backs are in terms of their directionality. Normally, a 5.1 design would have you just at the edge of the ""sound bubble."" However, with 7.1 you're completely enveloped by sound every which way be it from the front, side, or behind. And because of that (in addition to the awesome design / mixing efforts of Michael Babcock and Anna Behlmer), we get a terrific soundscape that has truly brought the comic and legend to life. My favorite scenes would be the battle on Jotunheim (yet again) for its resounding bass, precision directionality, and overall vibrato, and of course, the battle on or any moment that the Bifrst itself is activated. Or, for something a little less boisterous I'd recommend the scene where Thor is breaking into the S.H.E.I.L.D. compound to retrieve Mjlner. There are some instances of thunder crackling in the night sky followed by some discretely-placed rainfall that sound pretty cool.

Extras - 4.0

I'm actually a little disappointed with the amount of behind-the-scenes footage, here. The movie felt very epic in scope and I was hoping it would've been as extensive as Iron Man with at least a second disc of extras approximating around 2 hours. Unfortunately, it only rounds out to something like 47 minutes without the Marvel One-Shot, Deleted Scenes, or Trailers.

- Audio Commentary (Director Kenneth Branagh)
This is only the first time I've heard him do one, but wow Branagh is really informative and knows his stuff. He covers just about everything else you wish they would've covered in the featurettes and does so in a very professional, yet open fashion. It's a quick-paced and brisk coverage of all things related to the film that tells you about: when he was approached to direct the film and what transpired, how he wanted to tell the story when making it, some of the thematic and symbolic ideas he wanted to display with the visuals, his experience with the actors, the prospect of filming in 3D and post-converting it, how they shot and came up with ideas for the visual effects, etc. There's hardly any dead space throughout and the man just keeps bombarding you with a plethora of factoids that are all prevalent to either the movie, the Marvel Universe, or to film-making in general. It's definitely worth a listen for fans of the film.

- Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant (HD; 3:57)
Presented in 1080p and Dolby Digital 5.1, this is a hilarious tie-in between some of the events of Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. We see Agent Coulson talking to Agent Sitwell about how the military is trying to push The Abomination as a candidate for the Avengers. Neither of them agree with the idea of putting him in, so they decide to sabotage negotiations with General Ross by sending ""The Consultant"" as a patsy to screw things up intentionally. It's short, but very much in the spirit of both Tony Stark and the comedic elements of the Marvel Movie Universe franchise thus far. Definitely give this a watch.

Featurettes (HD; 46:59 altogether)

- From Asgard to Earth (HD; 19:42)
This covers a big chunk of the film's production. It talks about things like the atmosphere of Thor, how they wanted to portray Asgard in terms of scope and design, and all the subtleties they went into for the costuming, make up, coloring, and camera work. In addition, this segment also covers some of the research done on the comic books to translate and adapt said material to look as real as possible, but also infuse the designs with enough imagination for that fantasy element. They then discuss Puente Antiguo (the little New Mexican town) and how it was completely built from scratch, as well as the design parallels to Asgard and how a lot of structures represented some of the more symbolic elements of the story's themes.

- Our Fearless Leader (HD; 3:18)

- Assembling the Troupe (HD; 4:44)
Discusses the casting of Thor, Jane, and Odin.

- Hammer Time (HD; 6:14)
Shows the various designs they went through to get the look of Mjolnir (about 200 different sketches), and how they constructed 3 different kinds of hammers for Hemsworth to using during filming.

- Creating Laufey (HD; 5:33)
The make up work and a little bit of discussion about the king of the Frost Giants.

- Music of the Gods (HD; 2:05)
A disappointingly short feature about Patrick Doyle's awesome score. I really wish this one were a lot longer.

- A Conversation (HD; 2:23)
Another short discussion with co-creator Stan Lee, co-producer Craig Kyle, comic book writer J. Michael Straczynski.

- Road to the Avengers (HD; 2:57)
A mishmash of footage from the other films in the MMU leading up The Avengers. It's nothing more than a tease, as there is no actual Avengers footage to be found.

- Deleted Scenes (HD; 24:34)
There is optional commentary from director Kenneth Branagh, and I think a few of those clips actually could've worked for the movie overall.

- Trailers (HD; 7:25)
Teaser, Theatrical, and Avengers Animated.

Overall - 4.5

Marvel Studios continues to churn out these very well-made pre-Avengers films. Up to this point, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor have all managed to be highly entertaining movies and still tell a very good character story to boot (well, minus Hulk, but it's a great action flick). Out of the entire lineup, though, Thor is definitely the most unique with its fantasy element and outer spacey galactic potential if the Studio ever decides to go otherworldly with another franchise (Silver Surfer by Alex Proyas would be a neat idea). Oh, and there's still Captain America to be explored (my favorite of them all, actually), but that will have to wait another month. With reference A/V quality and a decent amount of extras that are only salvaged by that kick-ass- commentary by Branagh, Thor comes highly recommended, especially for fans of the Marvel Movie Universe.",1316390400,5,12149,4.78206962327134

4577574,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Not very often do I say this but,...I wish I had seen this film in the theaters on the big screen. DVD is awesome but my 32"" TV just can't do the movie's grandeur justice.

Oh and before you ask, YES I am a huge fan of the comic books, and read Thor quite often. I think, what this film did best, was to take Thor off the pages of the comics, and place him on the big screen with (and this is important) true realism.
Okay, stop scratching your heads. What I mean is, I know its a fantasy but the filmmakers spared no expense to make it all seem ...real. Yes, there are changes from the book to the movie, but these are natural.
Most notably is the inclusion of a multi-ethnic cast. Changing the ethnicity of some of the characters was genius. It made it seem more true to life.

The costumes are another big chance from book to movie. Hollywood has gotten the message, yellow spandex doesn't work on film. No yellow spandex here. All the costumes are more armor-like, and give a nod to their comic book origins. The sets are spectacularly detailed. Even something as far-fetched as the ""rainbow bridge"" was made perfectly and felt true to the books while maintaining a sense of reality. This movie is action packed, some laughs at just the right moments, good solid story, and great cast. The directing is clean and very clear. Even if you have never read a page of the comic book, you will not get lost or feel left out.

If I had to give one complaint to this otherwise perfect movie, it would be in the DVD itself. There is no long, behind the scenes, ""making of"" Thor bonus on here. There is a very short Avengers tease, but that's it. This DVD needs a full 2 hour making of segment. Other than that, I would still have to say, don't rent, buy it.
And don't forget to wear your authentic Thor replica helmet and hold your realistic plastic hammer Mjolnir while you watch. You're gonna need them.",1316304000,,1900,4.331460674157303

Thor was a GREAT film... Fun for ALL ages... and one of the truly 5-Star Comic Adaptations I've seen in a while.  (and not because of the 3D -- and not solely for the amazing visuals --- the acting was GREAT --- and portrays ALL the characters, exactly how they were MEANT TO BE Portrayed... NOT how a handful of comic-fans, Thought they should be portrayed, based on a ""series/run"" you liked more than another ""series/run"")  ___  Also, if you go in thinking ""most marvel films are going to stink; but Thor should be the best marvel film ever because of Asgard"", as a few, ""fans"", have stated... then you put waaaaay to much expectation into this film --- and NOTHING would have lived up to it, even if EVERYTHING was exactly as you thought it should be!  (because let's face it -- people like you are NEVER satisfied!)
_____
Of all the comic adaptations I've seen... when I saw trailers for Thor, I thought, Oh wow... that's either going to be really good... or REALLY BAD (kinda like Green Lantern) -- I didn't even see Thor in the Theaters because I don't like wasting my money on movies that I'm not at least 80% sure on.... but man, I wish I had... seeing Thor 3D on the Big-Screen, would've had my mouth, gaping open w/ amazement, the entire time. (just from the visuals... never mind the rest of the 5-Star movie)

In the end, if you're still on the fence about this movie, due to all the comic-dorks who are never satisfied anyway.... then borrow it from a friend, or rent it / stream it / whatever... my guess is, you'll be pleasantly surprised, if you go in with an open mind.

It's basically an action movie, obviously based on Viking mythology, with a small romantic subplot tucked in there.  On the positive side, the graphics are pretty good, the acting is acceptable, and the movie did tend to hold my attention.  But on the negative side, it's a rather shallow movie when it comes to saying anything interesting or useful about the human condition, and there are some plot flaws which are nearly bad enough to undermine the whole movie.  In summary, this movie could be a decent choice if you really like this genre, but otherwise you won't miss much if you skip it.",1316304000,,660,4.663793103448276
4577577,4,B0055EAJ7A,"With Kenneth Branagh at the helm, it's hard not to draw comparisons between THOR and various Shakespearean tragedies: brash, arrogant son defies his father, bringing about apocalyptic consequences, only to find that he was betrayed by those whom he trusted most.  It's an age-old story, which works in THOR's favor: it lends the film a firm sense of ethos, a grand backdrop which Branagh manipulates with great skill.

It helps that he's chosen a fine cast.  Chris Hemsworth has solid screen presence; the film sags a bit when Thor loses his powers, but picks up admirably when he regains them.  Throughout, Hemsworth remains, at his worst, watchable, and at his best, thoroughly engaging.  As the devious Loki, Tom Hiddleston is a devious, manipulating wonder (stick around after the credits for what is arguably his best scene).  Anthony Hopkins finally has a role he can sink his teeth into again, and Stellan Skarsgard scores as a doubtful scientist.  Natlie Portman doesn't have a whole lot to do, but she does it well; same with Kat Dennings, who provides some of the film's necessary comic relief.  Clark Gregg is back as smarmy Agent Coulson, and Idris Elba has a grand bit part as a loyal gatekeeper.  Also look for: Ray Stevenson as a Norse warrior; Rene Russo as Thor's mother; Colm Feore as a menacing Ice Giant king; and Jeremy Renner in a thoroughly bada** cameo.

THOR definitely has its flaws, number one being its utter implausibility.  It's hard to bring the mystical wonder of comic books to the big screen; comic fans are much more willing to suspend disbelief than the average film-goer (though the popularity of such films as TWILIGHT and the TRANSFORMERS franchise says otherwise...).  Branagh doesn't try to convince us that all this is real; that tactic works great with heroes such as Batman, but when you're dealing with the Norse god of thunder, it's best to just shrug it off by having your hero declare: ""Your ancestors called it magic; you call it science.  Where I come from, they're one and the same.""  Branagh goes for the implausible epic; he doesn't succeed (to keep audiences interested, the film has to clock in under 2 hours, and it's hard to do an epic is such a short time), but it's a noble effort, and makes for one of the more entertaining superhero movies of late.  Not quite as good as IRON MAN, say, but a few steps above IRON MAN 2 or THE GREEN LANTERN.  It's refreshing to see a comic book film that isn't an origin story, or doesn't try to rewrite ""history.""  It's simply a straightforward film, featuring a solid cast, helmed by a reliable filmmaker.  If that's what you're in the mood for, it doesn't get much better than THOR.",1316304000,,2679,4.724731182795699

4577581,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Before I get to the movie, a couple of points I think worthy of mention.
First of all, if like me you are one of the people trying to embrace the new 3D wave, and have shelled out for the equipment to do so, it's a shame that you cannot buy a bare bones 3D version of the film.
DVD and now Blu-Ray have always given the choice it seems of a standard 1 disc release, and then a 2 or 3 disc ""special edition"" with bonus features etc.
While these are nice to have, it's harsh to have to shell out for the 3D release, with 4 discs, if you have no need for the other copies, perhaps this will change as 3D becomes more mainstream and affordable.

Secondly, watching this movie demonstrates the huge disparity or broad width of the PG-13 rating, with the exception of a few scary images, this film has no sex, no bad language, very little to offend, and the violence is stylized and succinct. One wonders how a movie like this, which I was happy to watch with younger children (7 & 9) after seeing myself first, has the same rating as something like the Twilight franchise? Perhaps this deserved less, others more or we need a middle rating in between?

Anyway, the movie itself.

Both the 3D version specifically and the BD version in this set have phenomenal pictures and sound, the opening part of the movie is quite darkly lit, but that is nothing to do with the reproduction here. The 3D is also nicely done, controlled like Avatar, without the director feeling the need to throw things out of the screen all the time and say ""this is 3D!"" like the rather ridiculous ""Drive Angry"".

The story is an old and has been well told in many formats over the years, young petulant and headstrong Thor get's on the wrong side of his father the King, thanks to some back stabbing connivance by younger brother Loki, and ends up on Earth, to find himself, and learn humility, sacrifice and how to be a king, not just a warrior.
The action is well interspersed and the movie moves at a nice pace, plenty of eye candy, some humor, and enough references to the upcoming Avengers flick next year to keep the comic book fans happy.
That said, and to reiterate the comments of others, this is a stand alone movie, whether you are familiar with the comics, Norse legends or not, and is well directed by Kenneth Branagh.
Good old fashioned storytelling it is, the movie opens strong, builds well, and ends satisfyingly, with enough of a crack in the door for a sequel, or to whet your appetite for the upcoming  aforementioned Avengers movie.
Heroes, villains, battles, betrayal, loyalty, and action abound, even the love interest is tastefully handled and compliments the story.
I for one was very impressed with relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth (I don't really count his cameo at the beginning on the Star Trek remake) and think he will definitely be one to watch.
5 stars for great entertainment, relax and enjoy with the whole family, just remember some of the scary stuff will be too much for very young viewers probably.",1316304000,,3007,4.510091743119266

Somehow this missed the mark, and the main actor had muscles and no ability to convince me of anything.  I would feel punished to ever have to watch this again.  If special effects look bad on a small screen, imagine how they look in HD! All around lower in my mind, and rated high here by fans, but ripped to shreds on many movie review sites along the lines of what I felt.

Chris Hemsworth plays a fantastic Thor, and the remaining cast was great too. The only con about this movie is that the 3D isn't that good (the end credit sequence with cosmic fly-bys was great though). And the main ""town"" used on Earth. It was obviously (by the look of the buildings, and the wide camera shots)... a movie set town. Which ruined it a bit for me. Why go to Asgard when Natalie Portman is on Earth? =] I understand the studio not wanting to show Thor's full out power potential in the first movie, but I hope this explored in The Avengers movie, or in a potential Thor 2.

One other note: each of the deleted scenes, with the possible exception of a small moment involving a dog, adds critical character introductions and depth which were palpably lacking when I first watched the theatrical cut. They should never have been cut from the film. It is a tragedy that the producers did not feel it worth polishing the special effects in these scenes for the BD, nor adding a branching option to watch a longer cut.",1316217600,,698,4.629032258064516

4577587,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Kenneth Branagh is really incredibly talented, both as an actor and as a director. This effort was no exception. Spot on effort introducing Thor to us, in the obvious direction of getting the individual Avenger movies out of the way. I would both expect a Thor sequel and anticipate an actual series of Avengers movies. We've had the Hulk, we've seen Iron Man, Captain America is out there. I am interested to see what comes next.
For this movie specifically, it serves to show why Thor would care about Midgard and also details the reasons behind his rivalry with his brother Loki.
Additionally, a lot of thought went into the imagery and the settings. Midgard in particular looks like an amazing blend of magic and technology, seamlessly blending together. BiFrost is a perfectly foreboding and frozen plane of existence, and the Earth setting (mostly in a desert town) works well. The settings actually serve as both important plot devices and awesome visions of worlds outside our own.
This is really a star laden event as well, so you will see quite a few familiar faces.

The entire Doctor Don Blake as Thor gimmick would have been too much for audiences. The modern version has Odin (Thor's dad, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins) casting out Thor to Earth.  His brother Loki has other plans to take over the kingdom called Asguard.  If you can suspend your disbelief in such a concept, you'll enjoy this take of the character. Thor was a take on the mytholgical character in Marvel comics style.  Without giving anything away; the villian at the end of the film called the Destroyer, made this movie worth watching. I liked the fact that the producers decided to keep Jack Kirby's design of the character. In fact, all of Jack's designs inpired this film. If your a comic book fan, this movie is a must buy.  It's a movie I'd gladly see again.  It has enough depth of character to draw viewers in, that aren't comic fans.",1316217600,,951,4.597633136094674
4577592,4,B0055EAJ7A,"As other reviewers have noted, bringing a Norse Thunder God (and Marvel Comic hero) to the big screen might  be just  a little chancy. Fortunately, Director Kenneth Branagh, veteran Shakespearean and TV/movie actor, embraces the epic quality of the hero and the story and runs with it. The result is an entertaining and eye-pleasing movie with just the right amounts of humor and gravitas, that moves easily between the otherworldly realm of Asgard and a dusty New Mexico town.

As the story opens, the arrogant young warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is banished from Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), for restarting a war with the feared Frost Giants. Ambitious trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is left behind to scheme for the throne.

Thor, stripped of his godly powers, plummets to Earth and promptly collides (literally) with a group of off-beat astro-physicists led by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). The movie milks some good humor from the resulting fish-out-of-water scenario without overdoing it. Thor is meant to learn some humility and wisdom; the path to worthiness will run through an action-filled encounter with S.H.I.E.L.D., a drunken mentoring session with Dr. Selvig, a delicate relationship with Jane, and a dramatic showdown with a monster sent to earth by Loki.

""Thor"" is highly recommended to Marvel Comic fans as a good adaptation of the Thor character to the screen, and as another entertaining step on the road to 2012's much-awaited Avenger movie.",1316217600,,1526,5.237704918032787

But no, sweetie, I had to explain, Kenneth wants us to return to the earth, the boring place with two dimensional characters that made us rent this video in the first place, so we could listen to Thor, God of Thunder, ask ""Deal?"" and then wait an aeon to hear Natalie Portman reply, ""Deal!"" No shortage of painful nonsense sapping the life out of this film faster than a Yodenheim frost jacket.

4577598,5,B0055EAJ7A,"As a man in my 50's, I grew up spending a great deal of time in the Marvel universe. I have taken issue with story line deviations, when the movie alters what I consider to be a key element of the comic storyline. The whole Doctor Doom representation in the Fantastic Four movie for example. Hard to understand why they didn't stick with the original plot premise when the outcome was a less than stellar product. In Thor, however, they managed to balance this with staying true to the original. The outcome is an immersive movie experience that brings the Marvel universe to life in a more contemporary fashion. This movie succeeds on many levels and appeals to people familiar with comic book or those who are not. My wife loved the movie, yet has probably never even read a comic book. From the casting to the costuming to the acting to the scenery to the special effects here is a movie that stands up to repeated viewings. A great deal of credit has to go to the Director as well. One of the reasons this movie works so well is because it doesn't get bogged down with lengthy explanations but provides the viewer with enough background to make the story plausible and fast moving.

The script could have ,as i said, explained more about well, everything. Had it done so, i would have liked this much more...",1316131200,,423,4.5064935064935066
4577602,3,B0055EAJ7A,"I am 58 and was a huge fan of the Jack Kirby Thor comics. Kirby captured the feeling of Asgaard perfectly for me. As with all of the Marvel superhero movies, we realize that most of the bulk of the comics was filled with fighting. That's why I liked Kirby... he made the fight scenes artistic, so I didn't actually realize they were violent. They were visual ballets, artistically designed sparring matches. This never really happens in the films... so far.
I could criticize this film by imagining how it could have been better... i.e. The Asgaardian scenes could have been more Michelangelo-ish, incredibly posed figures, dramatic and dynamic compositions, lyrical sunlit interludes, trolls and monsters and sparring matches, blah, blah, blah. But I realize that the director is only human, he is dealing with actors, and there is a budget... and... the film has to look like a Marvel film. That said... this is a pretty good film. I found myself caring for Thor when he is mortal, wishing he would kiss the girl, thrilled when he got his hammer/power back.
  I will note another movie-making problem here. Remember when they made Spiderman? and the CGI people had to make Doc Oc's arms realistically walk? I read that they had trouble because Steve Ditko had drawn great artwork that worked 2 dimensionally as still shots, but that the in-between action was very hard to visualize. Something like that is going on in the Thor movie. Kirby drew great sets, but we never actually saw the Gods transport anywhere, there was not an actual explanation of how they went anywhere and where that anywhere was. So in the movie we get this kind of science fiction universe, with a giant matter transporter and a rainbow bridge/wormhole. I suppose it sort-of works, and it had to be done somehow... but it all felt kind of forced.
  Now on to my dislikes. I never liked the frost giants in the comics. Kirby could never figure out how to draw them adequately, so I never liked them. In the movie, they are dark and black&blue, and their world is dark and black&blue. They look like bad guys, or like those Borg in Star Trek. They almost spoiled the movie for me. And then on top of that, they are main characters! They have their own realm where they just stand around stiffly being cold!
  And the OdinSleep! It is not explained at all. And it seems forced and unnecessary... it's a plot device.
  And Thor's friends from the comic book are there. But they are not as interesting and they don't do much. Volstagg is not as fat and not as funny. Sif is not as elegant and cool. Fandral is not as dashing. The other guy is now oriental, I don't remember that from the comic, but it's been a long time.
  Asgaard should have been more over-the-top hugely dramatic. With more eloquent speeches.
  Loki has been transformed from a God of mischief into a troubled son of dubious parents who is misguided and then really bad and then violent and then devious. He is confusing. He should have been much more melodramatic. He should have been a scene-stealer. The real star of the film.
  Thor is ok. Just ok. He looks pretty good. They altered Kirby's original outfit a little... it's darker ( what isn't anymore) He should have been more childish, fun-loving, braggadoshilicious, God-like.
  Most of my comments are based on my fond memories of Jack Kirby's Tales of Asgaard, Tales to Astonish, The Mighty Thor. That was a long time ago and I'm sure the Thor comic changed a lot over the years since then. I remember a long series of stories involving Hercules and spaceships and aliens and lots and lots of fun, fun, fun and imagination.
  There are a lot of funny, tongue-in-cheek moments in this movie. And I appreciated them. Stan Lee driving the pickup that tries to pull Thor's hammer out of the crater, The guy from  SHIELD, when confronted with the Destroyer, says to no one "" it's probably one of Tony Stark's, he never tells me anything"" These kind of moments harken back to the good ole days of Marvel.
  Oh, the Destroyer. One of my favorite Kirby designs,,, the empty suit of armor with a death beam. Seems kind of silly nowadays. In the movie it is taller and skinnier, but still scary.
  Again, the worst part of the film is the too dark Frost Giants and their realm. Anything else would have been better. Loki was too evil and confused. Odin was OK, should have been more massive. Asgaard should have been more dramatic. The scientists are pretty good. Nice ensemble group. Better than Thor's friends.

4577604,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Chris Hemsworth wields the hammer Mjolnir as the mighty god of thunder in the amusing superhero adventure Thor. For his reckless actions that reignites an ancient war, the powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Hemsworth) is cast out of the magical realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and exiled to live among the humans. On Earth, he meets Jane Foster, a young astrophysicist who becomes his first true love, and learns what it takes to be a true hero when his treacherous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) seizes the throne of Asgard. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor is an entertaining comic book blockbuster that delivers a fun mix of drama, humor, fantasy and action, but does fall a few notches below such notable big screen Marvel Comics releases like Spider-Man and Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth breakthrough performance as the fallen hero is one of the movie's true strengths. The cast also includes Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Alba, Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo and Clark Gregg.

Thor certainly satisfies all the requisites of a Blu-ray release of a summer blockbuster. The superhero adventure is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not quite reference quality, the video transfer is certainly sharp and truly stunning. Its spectacular DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack is one of the finest of any Blu-ray releases of 2011. Among special features, ""Thor"" includes an audio commentary by director Kenneth Branagh, 25 minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, several behind-the-scenes featurettes (From Asgard to Earth, Our Fearless Leader, Assembling the Troupe, Creating Laufey & Music of the Gods) and a short teaser of the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Thor, to me, is the most visually stunning of all the Marvel films I've seen thus far. Much more epic than X-Men: First Class, sorry to say. Whilst(here I go with Thor talk, lol) I won't go so far as to say that Thor is the Summer Blockbuster of 2011, either.

I am vaguely aware of who Thor is supposed to be, but I have no previous experience with his story so went into this movie with no expectations other than Marvel's prior movies.  I was hoping for something fun, interesting, and with a few unexpected twists--much like Iron Man, Spiderman, or even the newer Hulk, all of which I did enjoy.  This movie, sadly, was nothing like them.  I was mostly bored, just waiting for something to happen.  There were a few halfway decent special effects (most notably the watcher at the gate, peering out eerily from behind his temporary prison of ice).  But the acting and the characters were completely one dimensional.  The blue villians hardly even had one dimension--they were like cardboard cutouts.  Their planet made no sense, and they seemed to have no purpose other than running out for Thor to beat up.  Loki almost had a little depth, but his story seemed to be half untold.  The highlight of the entire movie, for my family, was spotting Stan Lee in the pickup trying to pull out the hammer from where it fell to earth.

4577609,4,B0055EAJ7A,"THOR, based on the graphic novels of old as well as Norse Mythology, was penned as an idea back in 2001 but then went into ""development hell"" for several years before it was moved along into an actual movie for release. And understandably so as the budget for this picture was $150M. Fortunately, THOR's overall box office yielded over $448M as of August 25th of this year so that means there will be a part 2 in July, 2013 (BTW, be sure to watch the end credits for the usual surprise that has Samuel Jackson in it). The special effects are impressive, the acting is above average to good and the overall story, while not brilliant, is good and seems to follow the general idea of the graphic novels (though take that with a grain of salt as I've read a few of them but don't have the whole collection on my shelf). Women who want a pretty boy beefcake get a few shots of the actor scantily clad and Thor fans will get a lot of overview of the Asgardian world (as well as Jotunheim) and a ton of Mjolnir action. The Frost Giants are done well and the play on ice was particularly better than I thought. Thor is headstrong and dumb early on but hopefully gains some wisdom (though I doubt he'll ditch his famous temper). Some people may have been expecting more of a battle epic ending but the focus was more on Thor's character maturing enough to become a great king like his father so the incident with the Bifrost Bridge shouldn't be entirely surprising (even if disappointing to some). Purists might have issue that not all of the Asgardians are white but who's to say those gods can't represent mortals all over the world? After all, who says the old Norse people got it right on skin colors anyway? That said, it's a nice inclusion of non white viewers into the world and this is the 21st century so it's probably a good move just as it's a good idea to have female style action heroes to make females feel more included in the fun. The romance with Portman was ho hum but acceptable. Loki was predictable but better than expected and Anthony Hopkins was a notch below par. I'm glad the franchise will continue as Thor is one of the more interesting Marvel Heroes.

4577611,5,B0055EAJ7A,"When I first heard about Thor after it was announced to be adapted to the big screen, I was skeptical. If you look at the character on paper, that is, in the comic books, he is quite ridiculous looking. However, after taking a step back and realizing that Thor is part of a bigger picture, and that Marvel Studios intended to unite several superheros into one story, The Avengers, I knew that they couldn't possibly get this one wrong. They didn't - Thor was dazzling and wildly entertaining. The CGI and special effects are some of the best ever put on screen. Asgard looks incredible, the costumes, set pieces, weapons, Frost Giants, all amazing. In my opinion, the film was also well cast. Chris Hemsworth tackles both jobs of being physically imposing as well as capturing Thor's personality. Tom Hiddleston really stole the show, however, with his take on Loki. I was really impressed with his performance, more so than the rest of the cast. I think he has done one of the best villains ever! This is a great film for fans of action, special effect, comic books, or the like. I love how the studio is tying all the stories together for next summer's superhero team-up, The Avengers.

4577613,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie.  There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful.  Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously  and that is refreshing.

Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo).  Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired.  Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etc

In addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around  soon.  The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people.  It is surprisingly successful!

4577614,4,B0055EAJ7A,"There have been enough reviews about the movie itself for months now, so this is basically going to be about the actual three-disc combo (though I know I'll probably stray off track).  I will say that I did like the movie on its own, and that all of the actors did a great job making you feel that each group belonged in their respective environments (ie:  Odin, Loki, Sif & the Warriors Three belonged in the heavens, and everyone on earth belonged on earth, and Chris Hemsworth did a fantastic job bulking up for the role.  I still don't know where all of the hate came from originally when he was cast).

I saw this movie in theaters in 3D, and thought that it had just the right mix of 3D to enhance the movie without making it overbearing, and throwing it in your face scene after scene.  Not that there's anything wrong with that (those types of movies are a lot of fun, too), and the 3D was definitely better than some of the other movies I've seen where the 3D was added post production.  The scenes flowed well in the theaters and when I watched it at home, the 3D effects still looked awesome.  I will admit that you can still tell when a movie is originally shot in 3D (Resident Evil looks awesome every time I watch it) versus being converted after the fact, but Thor definitely shows that studios are learning from their prior mistakes (I remember thinking that some scenes in Clash of the Titans almost looked like a pop up book, with a flat surface on top of a flat surface).
I also had a chance to listen to the commentary by Kenneth Branagh, and I have always liked how he is very articulate, and gives insight both on the actual production of the film, as well as his own experience with the actors.  There are several featurettes on the production of the film, a bunch of deleted scenes (which I haven't had time to watch yet), and a short with Agent Coulson having a discussion with another agent regarding events that happened in The Incredible Hulk, and even though it's nothing big, it was still entertaining.
All in all, if you enjoy the novelty of watching 3D movies at home, the three disc combo is a great way to go (the 3D Blu-Ray disc only contains the movie itself.  The regular Blu-Ray disc has the non-3D movie as well as the special features).  If you're not into the 3-D, the movie is still entertaining (I did watch it in 2D for the commentary).  I will admit that I love comic book movies, and I am biased toward them.  I really enjoyed the Iron Man movies and Captain America, and even The Hulk, and Thor was a solid 4, right between Cap and The Hulk.
The quality of these movies is definitely making me hungry for The Avengers next year.  Here's hoping for a 2 1/2 hour movie with a 3 hour special Joss Whedon Director's Cut on 3D Blu-Ray! :)

One quick addition.  I read a few reviews that complained about the 3D (and like I said, you can tell the 3D was added post production, so it's not going to be as brilliant as Resident Evil 3D, but it was still done well), and how during the dark scenes it was almost useless (like the scenes in the lair of the frost giants), so I went back and re-watched those scenes in 3D, and I still say it looks good.  Again, not phenomenal, but still impressive.  I've got a Toshiba 55"" 3D TV, so it's not an ultra high end, and those scenes still looked pretty good to me.  I could still see the difference in depth they were going for, and it looked pretty clear.  Then you have the scenes in Asgard, which are breathe taking in their grandeur.  So I still say, get the 3D version if you have a 3D TV, especially since the price difference is currently like $3.  If it were a lot more expensive, then I could totally see why you consider getting the normal Blu-Ray version.",1315958400,6,3748,4.31811697574893

Being honest I'm not a fan of Portman, however Chris Hemsworth plays Thor well and makes this worth watching.  My rating of 3 would be 4 but Portman's acting as usual drags it down one, too bad her best work was in Leon at the age of 13.

It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is.  I read the comic, but just go to the Wiki page if you need a refresher. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...

Bad doo doo goes down, traitor to the throne, dueling brothers - yeah yeah, it's alright in the beginning.  Then he falls to earth and the movie pretty much is over.  What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.

At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.

I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.",1315872000,7,1297,4.082677165354331
4577621,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor has real emotional depth way beyond what you would expect. It also has action and special effects second to none. After a while and because of the turn in story, you don't really think about those amazing effects, and that's a good thing. Instead, you're pulled into a story about people and that's a great thing.

I like this comicbook anti-hero fallen god.  He's gritty, primal, vain yet noble and somehow more real. The film does a great job of showing us how an arrogant son can come to grips with who and what he truly is. The movie draws the audience in with its confidence and it never lets you go. There's no doubt that Natalie Portman was an important piece of casting because she brings the story down to earth. Thor meets Portman's Jane Foster after he is banished from the home of the gods to live among mortals. The audience can relate to what Jane is experiencing and it grounds the film perfectly. That makes the action seem more real and that's a tough balancing act. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe!  This movie actually has a heart and a soul and a brain and I couldn't have asked for anything more.

I'd rather a movie be too cerebral then too dumb.  This film succeeds on a basic level. It jumps the boundaries of its genre to pull in viewers with originality and inventiveness. Calling it a standard action film doesn't do it justice. It's surprisingly deep and takes the time to set itself up.  A complete movie that really doesn't belong in the summer with the likes of the brainless films you know are going to hit soon.

The Asgard portions do look nice with high contrast colors and depth of perception but for much of the rest, the 3D effect is either hardly noticeable (for all the action on earth) or actually detrimental (frost giant sequences are too dark to be viewed in 3D).

Thor is cast out from his world and lands in present day and meets Jane (Portman).  Together they must find a way to get him home.  This is a rare type of comic book movie...one with an actual story that keeps you interested.  The acting is also the best I have seen in a movie like this in a long, long time.  Next to ""X-Men : First Class"" this is the best comic book movie of the summer, as well as one of the most exciting movies of the year.  Even the little roles are memorable and add to the story.  Anthony Hopkins and Renee Russo playing the mother and father give this movie credibility to being more then another super-hero movie.  If you are a fan of comic book movies you will love this.

From there I Pre-Ordered this Blu-Ray/DVD, my older brother Pre-Ordered, and my fiance Pre-Ordered! 3 separate copies!

Chris Hemsworth (Thor) has everything you want your Superhero to have; he's Charming, smiling, cocky & friendly, charismatic, and confident.  You don't get this from many actors these days, especially actors playing the roll of a superhero.

I was wrong...
Not only did I AND our 9 year old boy enjoy THOR, our 13 year old daughter, 15 year old goddaughter, and two more of our daughter's friends enjoyed it...ALL 3 TIMES WE SAW IT!!!
That's right...I saw THOR with our kids 3 times.  Granted, this is a bit over-killed, but we thoroughly enjoyed the movie every time and plan to purchase it on opening DVD release day.  Here's why:
1. I felt it was age appropriate.
2. Was it violent, sure...was it gory, no.
3. It had clear lines of good and bad, treated well with a myriad of complexities that led people to their struggles...so it felt honest.
4. I thought it was a GREAT play into the Avengers movie that is on the way.
5. I felt Branagh did a wonderful job directing...they should consider allowing him to direct the Avengers.

The most recent trek movie, for example, took every opportunity to fail at science they could (except with the quiet of space, I guess.)  THOR, however... Thor nailed the proper structural visualizations for nebulae like no one ever has in my movie-fanatic experience.

4577633,5,B0055EAJ7A,"""Thor"" is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat saga for the ages. No big surprise, given that it's directed by perhaps the greatest thing since Billy Shakespeare himself, the esteemed Sir Kenneth Branagh. I mean, talk about the ability to milk a scene like a mad cow driving at the teat. The man is a gift to the universe and, at the same time, proof that evolution does not exist.

Fathers and sons are not known to always get along. Such is the case with the rather stiff relationship between Odin and his half-related sons, Loki and Thor. I know, it totally sounds like I'm describing some twink skin flick so far.

But Thor is just a regular guy. He likes kicking back and drinking some brewskis with his bad guy-bashing buds, like our former president. He's just a fun-lovin' regular joe with his trusty hammer (sort of like our lord and savior, Jesus Christ the carpenter) who's not too uppity that he can't make you pancakes in the morning -- at least once he's smitten with a mortal, which is kind of perverted seeing as he's a god; it's like you or me going slumming for amputees.

Anyway, Natalie Portman, as the love interest, turns in her first decent acting since ""Mars Attacks!"" Why can't a girl study her wormhole in peace? That is the ultimate question this film brimming with sexual innuendos poses. Why indeed.",1315094400,5,1321,4.636752136752137
4577634,5,B0055EAJ7A,"There is no need to rehash what the movie is about since so many have done a great job in retelling the storyline. There are always naysayers who have to pick apart perfectly good movies. I am not a fan of comic books nor have I ever read one of them. I am a fan of mythology and especially Norse so I found the movie very entertaining.  The acting was excellent and believable. Chris Hemsworth made the film. He was perfectly cast in my opinion.  The actor who played Loki was excellent as well.  Each of the actors actually did a great job. Nothing can be taken and adapted and be exactly like the source.  The motion picture is a unique medium in its own right. I felt all the special effects were awesome. I liked the way they flashed back to see why Thor fell to Earth. It was a good touch. I caught the in jokes in the movie and it wasn't from reading comic books.

I have probably watched this movie six times now and it is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. I have seen many and series with them as well since I am an older woman. I found it a breath of fresh air that the movie was more than a lot of fast action sequences and battles, yet you do get your fill. It made the story more plausible that even though some of the characters were referred to as gods and had super powers,the characters and their actions felt realistic and that they had feelings and emotions beyond ""look at me and kneel to me,"" which was how Thor first acted with his arrogance when he arrived on Earth. In the end, he learned humility and self-sacrifice, which was predictable but would have caused the movie to fall flat without it.  The theme itself is nothing new but there isn't much new to put in films, so that leaves the way it is presented and the actor portraying the part.  They raised him above a mere brute with powers to a god who gains insight into what it means to care about others without expecting anything in return. The romance issue was very subtle and well portrayed. I thought it was excellent and I have pre-ordered the movie and can hardly wait until the sequel comes out and yes, there is going to be a sequel because despite what some said they are making a Thor 2 because this movie was very successful. It is a good, solid, fun, fantasy movie.",1314662400,8,2276,4.242494226327945
4577635,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I must have waited for what felt like a lifetime for this movie to come out and it was well worth the wait.  I've only seen one movie that Kenneth Branagh directed and that was Frankenstein which I think came out more than 10 years ago. It wasn't great but decent enough.  And I've only seen Chris Hemsworth in one movie, Star Trek for maybe 6 or 7 minutes (I thought he did really well for 7 minutes and for a relative unknown),  Between the two, I thought this should be at least an interesting movie.  But why I was really excited was the fact it was going to be a Marvel Studios made movie, and they tend to be very selective about their directors and main actors.  Really did you think Iron Man was going to be as good as it was when it first came out?  And I thought The Incredible Hulk was pretty good, at least much better than the first version.  I thought Thor was really well done.  Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian background was evident throughout the movie.  It had the right dramatic and subtle touches, all befitting the Norse Gods.  While I thought Chris Hemsworth, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman were sincere and awesome, I thought the skill and subtlety of Tom Hiddleston was amazing.  Unless you read the comic books, which I didn't, in the movie, you see what looks like overt support and respect Loki has for Thor but Tom Hiddleston plays it perfectly by ever so slightly giving you the sense that it's not all as it seems with Loki.  And then there was Idris Elba as Heimdall.  I've never seen him before, but I do look forward to seeing him again in Thor 2 (at least I really hope so).  Heimdall isn't a big part but it's an important one and I really thought Idris Elba played it so well that he made the role even more prominent.  You're wondering why I didn't give Thor 5 stars.  Well, I loved the movie but two things stopped me from giving it five stars.  One, I felt it should have taken a little more to turn Thor from an uncaring, arrogant God to a wiser, more benevolent God.  I mean it just seemed all too fast and easy, it really should be harder than that.  The second thing was the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster.  I think that should have been developed more as well.  At the end everyone saids that Thor really missed Jane Foster, but while I know there was a connection beginning there, I didn't feel like it was ever strong enough for him to miss her like that.  Other than that, the story was coherent and well written, it was well acted, it moved right along and well directed.

4577636,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Great fun! And who cares if Kenneth Branagh has lowered himself to doing Marvel Comics adaptations after having once been in the lofty heights of producing Shakespearean theatre - the film has everything you'd find in a Shakespeare production, including battle helmets and cod pieces. Chris Helmsworth makes a great Thor (blonde, big, lots of doughy muscles and a bit dopey to match), Anthony Hopkins makes a great Odin (grim, imperious and iron-hearted), and Tom Hiddleston makes a great Loki (sneaky, slinky and possessed of a wicked grin). Like most other Marvel Comics movie adaptations, this one bears a lot of similarity with the original comic, while also diverging from it. Sure, Jane Foster was Marvel's most boring character in the original '60s comics, while in the year 2011 she's become an astrophysicist played by Natalie Portman (?!?), and we can skip (for the most part) that whole Dr Donald Blake thing - make fun of it, even - and just carry on with our day.  Hooray!  Thor gets banished to Midgard (our muddy old Earth) and he makes friend (and lovers) with his charm. He confronts some sort of destroyer drone, then goes nutso on heaven and earth in a war on sneaky ice demons. Great fun. Still, though, I don't know who the actor Stellan Skarsgrd is, nor the film character he plays called ""Erik Selvig."" Is he important?

Directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Hemsworth as the title character, Thor is a fairly brisk and wonderfully fun film that doesn't quite feel a major set-up for The Avengers movie like Iron Man 2 did before it.  Exiled to Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) to learn humility, Thor becomes attracted to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and seeks to return home to Asgard, while his nefarious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plots a hostile takeover of his homeworld.  With a wonderful cast that also features Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Colm Feore, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba, Ray Stevenson, and Jamie Alexander as fellow Gods and friends, Thor is a flat-out blast.  Even though it doesn't leave that same feeling of awe-inspiring awesomeness that the first Iron Man did, Thor is a great adaptation of a legendary comic book character, and here's hoping that the next time we see the Thunder God on the big screen, it will be just as good or hopefully even better.",1312416000,3,1228,4.833333333333333

There was a line toward the beginning of the movie I particularly agree with. ""Who's to say beings from another demention didn't come here centuries ago and a primitive culture like the Vikings worshiped them as Gods""? Great line and a nice thought. The choice of Anthony Hopkins to play Odin Allfather was PERFECTION!!!! Chris Hensworth was also perfect for Thor, his brother Liam is far too young.

4577648,3,B0055EAJ7A,"One can't say Kenneth Branagh's Thor isn't ambitious. This adaptation of a comic book based on Norse mythology includes romance, humor, family drama, and lots of special effects. Unfortunately, the film is a confusing mish mash, aspiring to be both more and less than what it is.

The film begins in a New Mexican desert and awkwardly segues into a distant flashback, before moving into a more recent flashback and then back to the present. The recent flashback follows the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the planet Asgard. Thor's arrogance lands him on Earth many miles from home. Confused and frustrated, he stumbles upon a group of scientists, at least one of whom, Jane (Natalie Portman), is willing to overlook his bizarre behavior and help him find a way home.

One section of this film is set in Asgard, a visual creation both kitschy and beautiful. A much lighter section involves Thor's humorous adjustment to Earth. Yet another section involves S.H.I.E.L.D., a group of government agents who are interested in an unmovable hammer which Odin threw to earth.

The script is an odd mixture of genuinely funny and unintentionally humorous. The social and physical laws that govern Asgard are hardly explained, and the pacing picks up when our hero falls to Earth. The agents are present to connect Thor to other superhero films produced by Marvel, and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s role is entirely unrelated to the plot. However, its scenes are some of the most functional in the movie.

The actors seem to be in several different films. Hemsworth fares well as Thor, seamlessly shifting between several genres. His transformation from cocky to contrite to compassionate is far more believable than his love story. Portman's Jane is cute and her attraction to Thor is understandable, but the film implies that they fall in love without showing us how. Watching them giggle at one another is not particularly gripping.

Kat Dennings, who plays Jane's assistant Darcy, is natural in her delivery of amusing one-liners. Thor's friends, The Warriors Three, seem to have stepped out of a science fiction show, Hopkins is low key as the patriarch, and Renee Russo has a thankless, tiny role as Thor's helpless mother. Colm Feore does his best as Laufey, leader of the blue Frost Giants, and a great Idris Elba plays a seemingly implacable gatekeeper to other worlds.

Most baffling (and, in some ways, interesting) is Thor's brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. He appears to be in five different movies. Loki is almost as important a character as Thor. Too little time is spent with him to completely understand his motivations, but because the audience follows his character, the tricks he pulls feel like tricks on the audience. Alternately calculated and extremely emotional, he is more bizarre than intriguingly ambiguous. Hiddleston gives an expressive, even furious performance, making his campier moments stand out all the more.

Patrick Doyle's soundtrack is stirring. Sometimes its high quality only emphasizes what the film lacks. In the end, Thor's numerous distractions prevent it from either remaining lighthearted or developing its mythological elements. Weighed down by special effects, action, and dumb lines, Thor is an original idea that seems determined to be a mediocre film.",1312070400,2,3325,5.146296296296296

You have to give credit to Marvel for pulling it off. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and the story is exciting and entertaining. However, it is in the humour stakes that Thor really delivers.

The film is fun and often makes you laugh.

Hemsworth seems to have some good style and charm but they didn't really give the character too much for him to showcase that.  The sidekick characters were all pretty boring.

4577656,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is one of Marvel comics lesser known heros. So when Marvel decided to make a movie about Thor I felt that they were getting greedy due to the success of Iron Man. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Thor is a wonderful movie. Wonderful for many reasons. First it has a sense of humor. This movie is all about fantasy and fun. Thor is the God of Thunder and Chris Hemsworth looks every bit the part. He is dashingly handsome and buff and arrogant yet Hemsworth's talent is such that you never resent him for being arrogant. He's a lovable cocky big lug. The movie starts with Thor on his home planet of Asgard. Thor wants to confront his mortal enemies the Ice Giants, his father Odin, played expertly by the legendary Anthony Hopkins wants diplomacy to prevail. Yet Thor presses the issue and this breach gets him exiled to Earth without his powers only his all powerful hammer Mjolnir which carries the power of an entire planet. Thor on Earth is both hilarious and arrogant at once. Hemsworth is talented enough to pull this off. I laughed when a nurse draws blood from Thor and Thor bellows: ""How dare you attack the Son of Odin!"" It is that kind of humor that makes this movie so good it's a perfect blend of humor, action and great acting. Hemsworth is a stunning revelation hopefully he will get great roles in the future to make him a huge star because he's a great looking guy with a great body and all the acting talent to back up his looks. Natalie Portman plays the love interest but this love affair is not the overwhelming forced sexfest of most action movies. Instead this love affair is sweet and romantic. It reminds me of the love affair between Lois Lane and Superman in the original Superman movie from 1977. Watching Portman's character and Thor kiss at the end of the movie actually means something. A lot more than all the gritty sex scenes in most action films. Thor is a perfect summer movie full of fun, humor a little action and a sweet romance. 5 stars all the way!!",1311120000,12,1994,4.465753424657534

4577658,5,B0055EAJ7A,"This movie was very, very good from start to finish. If you love comic book adventures, then Thor has a good but different look into the life of a superhero movie. It is more of an introductory story rather than an origin since our main protaganist was born to be a super hero, not some accident-gone-wrong mutation like a lot of the others, which works for them, but not for Thor. Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian, who are beings from another dimension who are far superior in strength and power compared to people living on Earth.
The family drama between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons, Thor and Loki(Tom Hiddleston), plays out wonderfully and is essentially the main driving plot in this movie. Thor is a proud and arrogant warrior prince who is destined to be the King of Asgard whenever his father, Odin, thinks he is worthy of that title. Soon into the movie Thor disobeys an important request from his father that ultimately jeapordizes the peaceful times on Asgard by assaulting the Asgardians ancient enemies, the Frost Giants of Jotenheim. Odin is outraged at his eldest son and quickly strips him of his ""godly"" powers and banishes him to Earth until a time that he learns the error of his actions. Upon Earth, Thor quickly meets a group of scientists led by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who, through some mis-adventures, end up helping Thor to find his purpose behind his banishment. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, King Odin is falling into a coma, a rest he needs to replensh his awesome powers from time to time called the ""Odinsleep"" and cannot continue commanding Asgard, so Thors brother Loki assumes command in his place. But is all good with Loki? He seems to have a mysterious past, and now his motives are a little unclear as to why he wants to rule Asgard.
Back on Earth, Thor must quickly learn his lesson in humility and get back to Asgard and set the things he messed up straight.

Overall, this movie was very well acted. Director Kenneth Branagh deserves many kudos for getting good performances from his lead actors. Many have said that Tom Hiddleston steals the show with his portrayal of the jealous brother, Loki. And he readily does! The set designs in this movie were top notch- the interiors of Odins Throne room, Heimdalls observatory and parts of the frost giants homeworld were all stage built and they looked wonderful. The small town in New Mexico for the Earth scenes was built as well, but maybe this you can tell as it kind of looks simplistic, but it was still more than serviceable for the movies sake.
And I'm kind of tired of people saying Thor and Janes ""Romance"" was to short to be believable. First of all, who ever said it was a full-blown romance gone full circle? I never once heard either character proclaim their love for one another. This was just Thor and Janes introduction to each other. They developed a crush for each other, and the filmmakers are waiting for the sequels to flesh it out even more. Have some patience people, this will pay off down the road.
Buy or rent this movie and enjoy a great adventure with good action, you won't be disappointed! 4.5/5  (rounded up to 5/5)",1310601600,5,3164,4.648214285714285

4577662,1,B0055EAJ7A,"When it became clear that Hollywood was going to try to make a movie out of every major Marvel comic character, my opinion was that they would all be mediocre to bad.  I always thought that the best adaptation would have to be Thor, because the visuals necessary to create Asgard would have to be spectacular.  In 2011's Thor, starring some guy who doesn't do a good job playing Thor as Thor, Asgard is pretty cool looking, but nothing special.  Everything else about this film is stupid crap marketed towards the stupidest of the stupid, aka, the general movie-going public.

Pretty much everything about this movie is terrible, but here are my key points:

(1) LOKI - Loki, whether the Norse myth Loki or the Marvel villain Loki, is supposed to be MISCHIEVOUS.  He shape shifts, disappears, plays both sides, plays pranks, hides and steals things.  Primarily he is the shallow foil to Thor's heroics.  In the movie, he is brooding and whiny.  He quietly contemplates and is jealous of Thor.  The comic book has always shown him to be quite flamboyant and flippant, almost resembling the Joker.  Here he is like a despondent teenager.  This movie got Loki completely wrong.

(2) THOR - Thor should be slightly stupid, the type of hero so committed to being a hero that he comes across as a simpleton.  Above all, he should possess medieval chivalry that seems out of place in modern times.  Here he is like a supermodel whose come to be cool, look good, and save the planet or something.

(3).  VILLAINS - Villains are as important as the superhero in comic book movies; who are the villains in Thor?  Is it Loki? I hope not because half the time they are getting along, and Loki is really really bad at being Loki, so that doesn't work.  Is it the ice giants?  Well, they are gone after the first battle, so it ain't them.  What about the Destroyer? Well, that is really just a mindless weapon of the Asgardians used against Thor in a brief and bland battle.  NO VILLAIN IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE?!?!?! Yep, you heard that.

(4) THE ROMANCE - Natalie Portman really just serves as a prop in this movie. These movies, because of the formula to sell tickets and not hurt the brains of the morons seeing them, NEED a love interest.  Portman serves as a piece of meat to make sure that Thor doesn't end without Thor kind of falling in love.  Everything out of her mouth is some sort of sassy comment that Thor, whose been on the planet for a few hours, really shouldn't be able to understand.  Also, Thor's transition from fallen-from-the-skies god to sensitive human is way to brief and undeveloped.

I could go on forever, but I'll end saying this.  I left the theater surrounded by a large crowd of people who clearly thought this movie was awesome.  I do not think that was their own opinion.  I think what has occurred is they've been trained like dogs to like just about anything that is waved in front of their face in a familiar fashion.  ""Ohhh, we are at a comic book movie.  Comics are familiar, I like comics.  Boy, this is good. I can't wait to see Captain America.  I like comics.""

2) I hated the treatment of the Norse myth. Admittedly I should have expected that from Marvel, but the actual Norse legends are so much more...alive than what we get in this movie.

The actor chosen to play ""Thor"" certainly had the look, but he certainly didn't have the script needed to determine whether or not he has the acting chops to do the role justice.

That's another story though...",1308614400,5,992,4.689655172413793
4577669,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I did go into the theater expecting to love this film, and it far exceeded my expectations. The beginning's a bit awkward--starting with Thor's arrival on Earth, then abruptly backtracking to how he got there and replaying the opening scene, but from there on, the pacing is excellent.

A prince in his own realm, heir to the throne of Asgard, Thor is a young man in desperate need of some anger management counseling. This prince's temper is measured on the Richter scale. When his coronation is interrupted by the intrusion of  beings from another realm, Thor seeks revenge--and re-ignites an ancient war. This leads his angry and disappointed father, Odin, to banish him to Midgard--Earth--to teach him a lesson in humility. Thor must live as a mortal man until he can prove himself worthy. Then, and only then, will his magic hammer, Mjolnir, be returned to him, along with his power and his immortality.

Mjolnir has also been sent to Earth--trapped in a Sword in the Stone-type scenario in the New Mexico desert. (Look for Thor's creator, Stan Lee, in his obligatory cameo as one of a crowd of rednecks trying to withdraw the mystical hammer from the stone. Good thing Stan can afford to buy a new truck!)

The fish-out-of-water aspect of the story is humorous without being over the top. In Thor's first twenty-four hours on Earth, he's hit by a car twice (three times if you count the replay of the opening scene), had a hypodermic full of tranquilizers shot into his butt, gone drinking with Jane Foster's mentor, Erik Selvig (and had to carry him home when he passed out), and takes on a platoon of S.H.I.E.L.D. guards surrounding Mjolnir.

It was those moments of humor I enjoyed most--and that price-of-admission scene of a shirtless Thor (when the film comes out on DVD, that scene's going to get a lot of replay action). Chris Hemsworth portrays Thor with the regal bearing of a prince, the ferocity of a warrior, and the good humor of a regular guy.  The budding romance between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman), however, didn't get enough screen time to convince the audience it was true love. Note to screenwriters: SHOW, DON'T TELL! The audience needs to believe Thor has made enough of an emotional bond with Jane and others here on Earth to overcome centuries of arrogance  on his part.

As Thor comes to terms with his exile, trouble is brewing in Asgard. Odin has fallen into a coma and Thor's younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is taking over the kingdom. Thor's loyal friends, the Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, defy royal decree and head for Earth to find him and bring him home. In a confrontation with a gigantic destroyer from their realm, the five of them join forces to defeat the enemy. And when Thor makes the decision to sacrifice himself, caring more for Jane and the others than for himself, his powers and his immortality are restored.

The dialogue is sharp and witty. In one scene, future Avenger Hawkeye observes Thor's battles with S.H.I.E.L.D. security and asks Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) if he should take him out ""or are you going to send out more guys for him to beat up?""

When Thor's Asgardian buddies walk down the town's main street in search of their friend, a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative reports to Coulson, ""We have Xena, Robin Hood....""

And then there's the scene in which Thor goes to a pet shop to get a horse. When he's told they only sell dogs, cats and birds, he says, ""Give me one big enough to ride.""

There are also not-so-subtle nods to other Marvel superheroes. When the Asgardian destroyer arrives on Earth, Agent Coulson is asked, ""Is that one of Stark's?"" To which Coulson responds, ""That man never tells me anything."" In another scene, a reference is made to a scientist working on the effects of gamma radiation (that would be Dr. Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk).

I won't give away the ending, difficult as it is to resist, but it's both spectacular and bittersweet. If you want a movie that's fast-paced, exciting, fun and even romantic, look no further. This is it!",1308614400,13,4041,4.739316239316239

4577674,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Comic book fans get a lot of flak for being nerds, dweebs and geeks; or at least they used to. Now comics are en vogue as millions of people attend geekfests like Comic Con; although whether that's to see the movie and television stars in attendance remains to be seen. Comic book characters are our mythology, they rival the super powered beings and gods of ancient Greek, Mesopotamian, and Viking mythology. We as humans have always felt this need to look up to higher powers to sort out our lives, believing that the fate of our race is better left in the hands of someone capable of bending the rules of physics. It's only natural then that eventually the worlds of comics and ancient mythology would collide as it does in the new Marvel movie Thor.

Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the arrogant first born son of King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) of Asgard, and the rightful heir to the throne. When Thor commits an act that could lead to war between Asgard and the Frostgiants, with whom they have a very shaky truce, Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth until he learns humility. On Earth Thor is found by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team (Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings) as they study atmospheric disturbances in New Mexico.

Thor is one of Marvel's lesser known properties, despite having been created by Stan Lee back in 1962. An integral character in Marvel's super powered team The Avengers, the movie version of the comic book was announced not long after the success of Iron Man as part of Marvel Studios attempt to bring The Avengers to the big screen. While Marvel has had great success with the first Iron Man movie and to a lesser extent Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk (which is the closest Marvel Studios has come to failure so far), Thor was a risky proposition with the greatest potential for failure. How does one meld the worlds of the mythical Asgard and Earth seamlessly into a movie that is part of a bigger picture with characters that are based solely in our realm?

Enter Kenneth Branagh. The success of Thor can largely be pinned on having a filmmaker with appropriate gravitas to ground the film. Branagh is a star of stage as well as film (for those of you unfamiliar with the name he played Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). The presence of Branagh alone was somewhat curious considering he's known more for directing acclaimed works like Hamlet (1996) and Henry V (1989) and even as an Irishman the English consider him one of the leaders in Shakespearean theater. It's that knowledge of film and theater that really guides Thor as he borrows as much from Shakespeare's Henry V as he does from modern action films.

Also adding to the weight of Kenneth Branagh's credentials are a list of acclaimed and award winning actors and actresses such as Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba. Not only do they have the opportunity to ground the movie, but they also look like they're having fun. Part of why we enjoy this movie is because we can see that they enjoy the movie. No one ever really feels like they're hamming it up or sleepwalking through their scenes, you get the sense that aside from the emotions they convey for their characters concerning their predicaments they all want to be on this set and that feeling is infectious. Also Tom Hiddleston's Loki is a revelation at a time when I have to admit that Marvel Studio's previous villains have been lacking a certain je ne sais que. Hiddleston plays the character with a secret, and a glimmer behind the eyes that slowly unravels like a ripe onion throughout the film holding on to his deceit with the hope of another day. He's more complex than the previous villains that have come out of Marvel Studios, and I'm looking forward to his return in The Avengers.

The real linchpin for why this all works though is Chris Hemsworth. While having been around here and there in blink and you'll miss it parts, Hemsworth got his first big break in JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot in the pivotal role of George Kirk, father of James T. Kirk. While his place in geekdom had been set in a small yet important role, the question of whether he could pull off the Norse god turned Marvel superhero. In a lot of actor's hands this would have been a one note character bereft of emotion and humor. Hemsworth is a magnetic leading man, though, exuding charisma and confidence. His poise commands respect, and he effortlessly flows from emotion to emotion, arrogance to humility, with a comedic timing that leaves the audience in stitches but still doesn't undermine his character.

As with most, if not all comic book movies, this movie tries hard to give you a lot of plot in a short two hour span (I say short because it leaves you wanting more, the way a good action movie should). Naturally, some things are a little undercooked but don't ruin the movie. In the end, as much as I fell in love with Natalie Portman's character (as I do with almost any character she plays) the romantic connection between Thor and Foster didn't ring true because for most of the film he seemed somewhat disinterested only to find his infatuation with her later in the movie. Thor's progression from arrogant strongman to humble hero also seems to be slightly haphazard as it really feels as though it could have used more time to flesh out. Hemsworth does an admirable job making the audience feel each twist and turn of the character, but each twist and turn feels a little too abrupt to be genuine.

All in all though, this was an excellent film: a piece of escapist entertainment that embraces Shakespeare as much as it embraces modern blockbuster pop-art. On the scales of Marvel I'd rate this just slightly under Iron Man and far above Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. The fact that they were able to get Thor right gives me hope for The First Avenger: Captain America and The Avengers. If you're a fan of comic book movies, Iron Man, or Marvel I highly recommend that you give this film a try. Not to mention, this is quite possibly the best use of 3D I recall since Avatar. Check it out!

4577675,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is a fun super hero movie of a son stripped of his trusty hammer (by his father played by Anthony Hopkins) and his powers along with it. His mysterious brother watches as their father casts Thor to earth. Through the help of his earth friends (Natalie Portman) and his team from his home planet, Thor must recover his hammer and defeat the evil pulling the strings of the impending ice-men invasion. A well told story, with plenty of nice action pieces, special effects and good pacing, this is a worthwhile addition to your super hero collection, and the 3D really shines.

3D Review: The foreground pops clearly from the mid and background, resulting in a clear, impossible to miss 3D effect throughout most of the movie. Even though it was post converged 3D made after the film was finished in 2D, this doesn't matter, as the 3D is excellent and worth a purchase for 3DTV owners.

4577677,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Of all the comic book adaptations made, Thor was easily my most awaited. Thor is my favorite comic book character, so I couldn't wait to see him on the big screen. There were some worries though. Most modern adaptations of Thor weren't treated with much respect or dignity. I'm happy to say all my worries were quickly erased.

Like others have said, Thor is easily one of the toughest heroes to adapt onscreen. Thor is a hero who navigates between two connected, but different worlds. I thought the writers did a brilliant job all-around though. Thor has often been shown as a fish-out-of-water on earth, but I thought he adapted and fit-in well on earth here.

This isn't a true origins films as most comic book films usually are. Thors' early life is mostly grossed over, which is probably good. Probably take too much time to tell anyway. The early, but short battle between Asgard and the Frost Giants had me mesmerized from the beginnng.  And as a unapologetic fan of action films and/or sequences, I've got to say by action expectations were easily filled. Thor managed to get about 5-6 action sequences into a fairly complex storyline.

The story was quite complex but very good overall. Great casting choices all-around. Great villian in Loki. Much better than I expected actually. Always thought he was one-note in the comics, but the actor really fleshed him out. Our hero Thor was played beautifully I thought. Made me proud to be a Thor fan. Odin was just as regal and imposing as I've always envisioned him. Much respect to Sir Anthony Hopkins! Now I can sometimes do without the love interest aspects of these films, but I gotta say Natalie Portman as Jane, was very much appreciated and welcomed by me. She did a great job, plus I think she's kind of hot. Loved the Warriors Three, and especially loved the awesome and baeutiful warrior Lady Sif. Hope to see more of Sif in the sequels. Also enjoyed Thors' other earthly friendly, especially the one with Norway roots.

No complaints here at all. Well other than it being in 3D. Just felt the 3D wasn't needed, plus I never liked it. Others seem to like the 3D just fine though. I was thoroughly entertained by this film, and would have probably seen it 5 times if it wasn't in 3D. Can't wait until this gets released on blu-ray and dvd, and especially can't wait until the sequel comes out.",1308096000,29,2357,4.642685851318944
4577678,4,B0055EAJ7A,"I've never been a big comic book and thus never a big Thor fan. I'm just the generic guy that enjoys comic book movies.

That being said, this avenger line of comic book movies has been...less than decent IMO. I'm not a fan of the Iron Man movies and the Hulk (Ed Norton Version) was just a hair better than average. And in the greater scheme of things, none of the comic book movies that are coming out these days come close to comparing to the Nolan series of Batman movies.

However, Thor was a breath of fresh air. It was compelling, had superb acting (for the most part) and really kept my attention (without having Iron Man pee on fans...ugh). Overall this movie was really good. Thor is the arrogant God of Thunder and to teach him a lesson, Odin banishes him and strips him of his power. He learns how to be humble and care of others and thus learns what it means to be a true ruler.

The cons...some of the Thor sidekicks looked ridiculous and some of their acting skills left little to desire. I could have used a whole lot more Anthony Hopkins. He had some awesome moments but I felt he was under utilized.

Other than that...it's a great movie when you keep in mind it's a comic book movie. It's a fun time and you should watch it.",1307923200,3,1243,4.276595744680851
4577679,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is a difficult comic hero to bring to the big screen, but director Kenneth Branagh (Hamlet) has pulled it off with ease. What helps though is that Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as Thor and Tom Hiddleston is as well cast as his evil brother Loki. Plus, unlike with Iron Man 2, you get plenty of action to please you as well.
  Roger Ebert hated Thor and thinks that every Marvel film since Spider-Man 2, just hasn't been as good. However, Thor is the way it should be. What is a good comic adaption according to Ebert anyway, was Thor supposed use his powers to deliver pizza ? Was he supposed to spend half the movie pouring his heart out to Natalie Portman's answering machine as she just stands there listening looking annoyed ?
  After Thor loses his powers when he comes to Earth, was he supposed to strut down the street with a smile on his face as the song ""rain drops falling on my head"" plays ? No! Thor works as a magical and macho fantasy and that's exactly what a Thor movie should be!",1307750400,55,1005,4.329787234042553

If you are a fan of Marvel comics and Thor  you will know that he is seen wearing his helmet about 90% of the time.  Yet here he is seen with it on his head about, O, maybe 10% of the time??  Tops.  They just MUST have the pretty boy's face seen all the time for the girly factor.  Come on now.

As for the film itself?  Well the chick factor was MUCH higher than in the books but other than that I can honestly say that it was a terrific film.  The 3D was good, but not nearly as good as a film that I liked much better, Priest.

I would have given it 5 stars if they had the damn helmet on his head at LEAST 50% of the time (It looks so cool when Thor DOES have it on!) and if they had dropped the love factor down about 80%.",1307750400,5,793,3.7804878048780486

Instead what we get a film part X-Men (the opening fight was more danger room than anything else with characters acting more like inexperienced 20 somethings rather than gods) and part Love Story. Throw in the girl power performance of Portman, the near instant transformation of a God of War suddenly in touch with his soft and gooey side and enough over the top 'oooh shiny' and you've been delivered the latest in bland crowd pleasing hollywood bile.

Seriously it was like watching Superman Returns all over again. This film was just another case of Follow the Money Makers. Romance, a shallow plot and a green screen. Here's to hoping Captain America doesn't (completely) follow in this piece of garbage's footsteps...",1307664000,10,923,4.76875
4577682,5,B0055EAJ7A,"So, this isn't exactly the Mighty Thor comic book hero I used to read as a kid.  But Doctor Strange wasn't here either.  As representative offspring of the Norwegian immigrant population, I'm pleased to see one of the old heroes on the silver screen.  And despite the 965 A.D. date scripted to the war of the Frost Giants, that story really does have Ice Age roots.  Maybe even 10,965 B.C. if one considers M'jolnir was reputedly a stone hammer.  And like other myths, it became 'forged' after the Iron Age re-telling and possibly before the birth of Norse written language.

How admirably have the producers inducted a stone age myth into the 21st century?  I could have sworn that that New Mexico opening footage was about to insert theme music from the X-Files.  And the government security agency which moved in and surrounded Mjolnir could have been borrowed from Chis Carter's efforts as well.  It's refreshing to see the Marvel Comics adaptation of Cellular and WiFi technology and laptops in their film offerings here. (Devices which didn't exist back when I used to read Thor & Dr. Strange.)  I appreciated it just as much when they released an animated Dr. Strange.  It shows respect to the contemporary audience for their product.

Considering that J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed his 'Middle Earth' (in the common tongue) from the Norse, 'Midgard', I see a glimpse of other dimensions of the Marvel multiverse emerging.  There's no Hobbits here, just a reckless immortal who suddenly learns the frailty of mortality, and it's nobility.  (This isn't the original Donald Blake alter ego of Thor from the comic series.)

A sub plot of Loki scheming to destroy an entire race (the Frost Giants home world Jotunheim) is truly worthy of the Prince of Mischief.  Comic or not.  Thor is known as the 'friend of man', and for his strength and valor.  Likewise Loki, (blood brother to Odin himself) is known for his cunning and subtlety.  And these roles cast by the Marvel team are outstanding!

I would have liked to see Fenris, wolfen offspring of Loki.",1307577600,4,2050,4.836206896551724
4577683,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Just simply for the fact that they made Thor into a real movie is awesome.  The movie could have done without so many comedic jabs, however the fight scenes make up for the movies slow part.",1307404800,2,190,4.277777777777778
4577684,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Kenneth Branagh's Thor seamlessly blends the epic, sweeping mythos of the Norse gods with the effortless humor dand humanity.  I've been a comic book fan for years, though never a Thor fan, but this movie is accesible and entertaining to a newcomer.

It is a rare creation story that shows the origins of both the hero and the villain, and succeeds in making both believable.  Thor and the villain, Loki, each undergo a transformation- one a redemption, the other a fall from grace.  Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Chris Hemsworth as Thor bring ease and naturalism to their superhuman roles.  Natalie Portman is sweet and intelligent as Jane Foster, scientist and Thor's discoverer/love interest.

Thor is what summer movies are supposed to be- fun, fresh, and grand.",1307232000,11,763,4.968503937007874
4577685,5,B0055EAJ7A,"The summer of 2011 could easily be known as ""The Summer of Heroes"" (especially superheroes) with the likes of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" gracing the silver screen. But before any of those heroes made their triumphant arrival in theaters, the summer was kicked off to the thunderous release of the box office hit, ""Thor"".

After an impulsive act of violence jeopardizes the sanctity of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of his power and banished, by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), to Earth. There he encounters the lovely Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and realizes that there is more to life than glorious battles alongside his fellow Asgardians. With Thor out of the way, his step-brother Loki puts into motion a plan that threatens to destroy all Thor holds dear in Asgard and on Earth. With time running out Thor must prove to be worthy of the power he wielded and once more command the fury of the storm.

Of all the comic book characters that Marvel has either already adapted for feature films or have announced plans to do so, Thor seemed the most audacious as he is hardly one of their most recognizable comic staples to the general public. Not to mention, the choice of Kenneth Branagh, an actor and director known for his Shakespearean background, didn't seem an ideal fit for bringing the mystical realm of Asgard to life on the big screen.

However, after viewing this outstanding summer blockbuster, I must say that Marvel's bold choices paid off brilliantly. Not only is Thor fast-becoming a household name, but Kenneth Branagh proved to be a truly inspired choice for director. No doubt thanks to his Shakespearean roots, Branagh successfully envisioned a nearly perfect blend of the fantastic elements of Asgard, with the realism (or hyperrealism) that has been established in Marvel Studios' previous film releases with which this movie is connected.

Written by the writing duo of Ashley Miller and Zack Stenz (""X-Men: First Class""), alongside Don Payne (""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer""), and based on a story from comic book and film scribe J. Michael Stracyznski (""Changeling"") and Mark Protosevich (""I Am Legend""), the story for ""Thor"" is epic in scope (much larger than most first-attempt comic book adaptations ever dare), featuring incredible action, unforgettable characters, with plenty of drama, intensity, a budding romance, and even some comedy to boot.

Another apparent stroke of genius for this film was the casting, which was spot-on in nearly every instance. Leading the assemblage of characters is relative newcomer (to our shores anyway) Chris Hemsworth as the thunderer himself, Thor. Chris portrays Thor with such bravado, arrogance, and a seemingly unshakable desire for battle that exactly matches his early comic book days.

It is also worth mentioning that upon Thor's exile to Earth, Chris slowly brings out a softer side to the demoted god of thunder. Naturally conveying Thor's gradual embracing of humility and an understanding that violence isn't always the best solution.

With these two distinct sides to the character, we are left with a very well-rounded and believable hero of mythic proportions that feels much more real than I had ever expected.

Alongside, Thor is his step-brother Loki played to absolute perfection by Tom Hiddleston (""The Gathering Storm""). Loki has always been portrayed as a villainous character that went from harmless mischief to ultimately succumbing to his darker side due to his growing contempt for Thor.

In the film, Tom plays Loki as mischievous, but not completely evil (at least not yet). His actions though malicious in nature at times, are laced with an underlying desire for approval from those around him. In my opinion, this more deep-seeded emotional drive behind Loki's actions allowed for the character to be much more relatable and intriguing to the audience.

Rounding out the primary characters featured in this film is actress Natalie Portman (""Black Swan"") as Jane Foster. Some have criticized Natalie's role as being merely the damsel-in-distress. Or that she portrayed the character as head-over-heels in love with a man she's barely just met, rather than a mature woman with an infatuation. Personally, I disagree on both counts.

I felt that Natalie's role was decently fleshed out, albeit not as much as some of the other main characters, but that's where a sequel can come in handy. After all, this was really Thor's movie, and it was pivotal to not only this film, but the impending ""Avengers"" that audiences really come to know and understand him (which seems obvious to me). So, in that regard, some side characters were left slightly short-handed in the story department, but I never felt she was there merely for the damsel role or to be just eye candy.

As for the relationship between Thor and Jane, I felt it was handled naturally as both characters showed they liked each other and that it was merely an infatuation at the moment. Neither played it anything beyond that, as some other critics have stated. As for how Jane acted around Thor; Natalie played her as clearly with a new crush, and it felt very believable. To see the relationship as anything else is reading too much into it at this point.

But I digress. I must mention that there is a plethora of supporting roles in this film, several of which merit a mention, but to do so for each of them would take quite some time. So, let me be succinct by saying that almost every single one of the supporting players delivers great performances.

Each of the supporting cast members brought something different to strengthen the creative process of moviemaking. Plus, in several instances some of them provided brief moments of much-needed levity to break up the intensity and drama unfolding within the story.

Those supporting cast members that are clearly worthy of mentioning due to their importance to the story and/or excellent work in the film are: Kat Dennings (""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"") as Jane's college assistant Darcy (and a major source of the aforementioned levity), Ray Stevenson (""Punisher: War Zone"") as Volstagg, a member of Asgard's esteemed Warriors Three, and Idris Elba (""The Losers"") as Heimdall, guardian of the Bifrost Bridge.

Lastly, two pivotal roles in the film that don't receive a ton of screen time, yet were incredibly vital, are the roles of Odin and SHIELD agent Coulson, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (""The Silence of the Lambs"") and Clark Gregg (""Iron Man 2"") respectively.

Sir Anthony Hopkins was the ideal choice to play Odin, Thor's father and Lord of Asgard. Anthony always elevates any project he's involved in due to his incredible acting prowess, his almost regal demeanor, and the respect that he clearly commands from those around him. For Odin, Anthony brought all of these qualities to bear, and crafted a performance that is worthy of the king of the god-like Asgardians.

Actor Clark Gregg, whose character Agent Coulson, has become a staple of Marvel's feature films, once again steals almost every scene in which he appears. Clark's portrayal of Coulson is so entertaining to watch because in one scene he will appear affable and potentially a push-over, but then he will establish himself as an authority figure with a quiet strength to back it up.

It is this dichotomy within Agent Coulson that has allowed this potentially one-dimensional character to have such staying power. Plus, he has grown, developed, and become even more interesting every time we meet him in these films.

Now, beyond having a terrific story, director and cast, the film also boasted some truly spectacular visual effects sequences. From Asgard's majestic golden spires to the subtly multi-colored Bifrost Bridge (or Rainbow Bridge as it is sometimes referred) to the menacing Frost Giants, every supernatural or fantastical aspect of this film was rendered with such detail and precision that it literally blew away all of my expectations. Every frame looked as if it had been pulled directly from the comic book into amazing reality.

This movie featured Hollywood movie magic at its finest, and the quality on display played a significant role in the believability of the film. Bravo to all involved in the creation of the picture-perfect imagery that blended seamlessly with the live actors and physical sets and backgrounds.

So, if you haven't figured it out by now, ""Thor"" is an incredibly entertaining blockbuster film and a terrific way to kick off the summer movie season. Even for those moviegoers that aren't aware of the particulars for this character, I believe there is still plenty for you to enjoy in this film. This movie is definitely a must-see.

4577688,2,B0055EAJ7A,"Funny. I didn't get bored once during the course of ""Thor"". But if i start to think about it, most of what i have is complains. Not so much for what's on the screen but mostly for what is not. The music, especially the main theme, of Patrick Doyle was awesome and the charisma of the actors literally saved the day, that i can say. But too many questions are left unexplored and too many occasions are missed in order for me to fully appreciate this film.

The religiosity of it all disappointed me. The lack of it, to be more precise. What is a typical day for a God or a half-God? Do they simply sit on thrones and say important things? Do they simply stand still and look at space? The everyday nature of things was not clear and i do feel that this is an important point if you want to understand why those Gods love their home and their role. I would much rather stay on Earth, with the beautiful Natalie Portman, then return to Asgard. I never felt like i wanted to be there in the first place and live their lives.

And Gods cand die? Is that it? And they're capable of showing childish jealousy? What happens when we, ourselves, die? Do we go to Odin? So then, Jesus does not exist?

When you want to install a universe as a background for a story, don't you need to know every little detail even if you're not going to use them? In ""Avatar"" or ""The Lord Of The Rings"", you really do feel like you're in a ""real"" world with its complexities. Not Asgard. It feels static, like if every little place was built only because the script required it. It exists only for the duration of the scene.

On another level, super heroes have big cities to play in. Thor has... what? A small rural county lost in the desert? No headlines or media coverage? No chance for us to witness the heroism of our Hero through the eyes of the world? And is it normal for the character of Natalie Portman, a scientist, to believe so rapidly in Thor?

Basically, i feel like this movie wasn't taken seriously and that the universe and characters weren't really ""loved"" by the auhtors. Even the end was a let down. First, with the hammer (that simply ""goes"" to Thor ratter than being pulled from its plinthe, like the Excalibur sword) and second, with the ascension of The God of Thunder himself.

This last one (the ascension) is personal to me but darn it! The last track of the soundtrack is called ""Earth To Asgard"" and is simply glorious. Knowing the story, knowing that it's the last track, i would have thought that the last image of the film, accompanied by that great theme, would have been Thor flying with all his newfound glory to the sky while smiling and/or winking at Jane. A perfect way to end on a high. And boum! Fade to black. Instead, we have Thor sit around and laugh with his God-like Friends in a God-like Cafeteria.

I feel that this isn't the way you leave characters you truly love.",1306713600,13,2888,4.346938775510204
4577689,3,B0055EAJ7A,"On the plus side, Kenneth Branagh's Thor fulfills its intended purpose: to introduce the comic book character Thor to audiences prior to the release of the upcoming Avengers movie. The movie draws on the original Marvel comic book's background for Thor's origin as the Norse god banished to Earth by his father, Odin. While it preserves most of the relevant Asgardian characters (Thor's scheming brother Loki; his comrades Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg; the warrioress Sif, the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall; and others), there are some variations to the original storyline that fans of the comic will notice. That said however, the differences really won't matter to anyone not familiar with the comic and so aren't worth going into here.

Note: for those who are not familiar with the classic Marvel superhero team, the Avengers (in the upcoming film version anyway) consist of Iron Man (already introduced in the two Iron Man films of 2008 and 2010), the Incredible Hulk (introduced in the 2008 film of that name), Thor (introduced in this film) and Captain America (to be introduced in a film coming out later this year). Two other Avengers, the Black Widow and Hawkeye, while not being given their own films, have been introduced in the others, the Black Widow in a cameo in the second Iron Man film and Hawkeye in a cameo here in Thor.

I can't say that Thor is a great film. It's watchable and fulfills its mission, but I think less would have been more. The back-and-forth plot that keeps switching between Earth and Asgard makes it hard for the film to really build up any momentum. The beginning is, quite frankly rather slow as it fills in a lot of background, and the film doesn't really seem to hit its stride until almost an hour in. This is definitely a case where less would have been more. A slimmer, more focused film would've allowed for more character development and more heart.

The casting is something of a mixed bag, though to be fair to the actors the script's frequently banal dialogue doesn't really allow for much character development. The good news is that Chris Hemsworth fills the bill as Thor, and looks awesome when he's in full armor (though they thankfully ditched the stupid helmet from the comic). Anthony Hopkins is a decent Odin, and Tom Hiddleson actually manages to imbue Loki with some surprising depth.  The two most pleasant surprises were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Josh Dallas as Fandral. More than any other actors in the film, Elba and Dallas seemed to really _get_ the whole heroic comic-book feel that the film called for, Elba in his solemn, duty-bound but conflicted guardian Heimdall, and Dallas in his dashing, reveling-in-the-fight Fandral who really lights up the screen when he's on.

On the down side, Natalie Portman was wasted, mainly again due to the script, which limits her to a brilliant-female-scientist-who-falls-in-love-with-muscular-hunk-because-the-plot-demands-it role. Ray Stevenson, whom I've loved in other rolls and who can be heroic and wickedly funny at the same time, was also wasted.  He's well cast as Volstagg, who is _supposed_ to be funny, but the script never lets him actually _be_ funny. And Tadanobu Asano as Hogun is just _wrong_; Asgardian warriors should _not_ have Japanese accents.

There are a few cameos to watch for.  Stan Lee, the writer who essentially created the Thor character for Marvel comics back in the 60's, is in there.  J. Michael Straczynski who wrote the story for the movie (not the script - can't blame that on him) is in there. And a recent two-time Oscar-nominee whom I won't name but who you'll immediately recognize, gives you a hint of what he's going to be like as Hawkeye in the upcoming Avengers film.

As for the 3D, Thor is a classic case of why retrofitting a film into 3D is usually a bad idea. It makes a film darker, literally, and this effect really shows up in Thor. Some sections are so dark they'll have you instinctively squinting. And quite honestly, I can't recall a single scene where the 3D was even really noticeable, let alone noteworthy. You won't be missing a thing seeing this one as a normal film.

4577690,4,B0055EAJ7A,"The God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) is banished to Earth to live as a powerless human in payment for his arrogance, where he befriends mortals (Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings) and comes to the notice of SHIELD, unaware of the cataclysmic political situation playing itself out back on his homeworld of Asgard.

This is a rousing adventure and a very successful adaptation of the comic book.  Hemsworth has the size, the arrogance, and the charm that his role requires.  Anthony Hopkins is imposing as Odin and Tom Hiddleston makes a surprisingly sympathetic Loki.  The complex relationship between the father and his two sons is one of the film's greatest strengths.  Unfortunately, the earthly segments are the weakest.  Even though the filmmakers had a lot of story to get through, Thor seemed to settle into his exile on Earth a little too quickly.  I also didn't believe his romance with Jane Foster.  I could understand why she might fall for a charismatic god who fell out of a wormhole, but it was harder to see why he would return the feeling when she was really nothing more to him than a kind stranger with a pretty face.  Fortunately, the film moves back to Asgard for its rousing finale.  Viewers with the patience to sit through the lengthy credits will be rewarded with a final scene that teases the Avengers movie.",1306627200,,1352,4.813852813852814
4577691,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Guilty as charged - I go to the movies for a sense of escapism and ""Thor"" did not disappoint me.  The Norse tales are all built on perception and Branaugh took the challenge and made something both entertaining and a tribute to a bygone age - at least for me, he gave Norse mythology and folklore a whole new dimension.

The dialog is solid.  Thor is believable - if you choose to - and his ""friends"" display a solid chemistry, as well as loyalty, that has you cheering when the good guys win.  And yes - I did cheer.  Nothing quite like a good story that reaches out and pulls you in.

But don't listen to the critics, or to me - go see it for yourself and decide for yourself.

4577692,2,B0055EAJ7A,"When I watch a superhero movie, I generally expect memorable heroes and villains, good action, a solid plot, and the heroes in question somehow being recognized by the public. There are other things that should be striven for, such as an interesting supporting cast, but I think a movie in the superhero subgenre can get away with leaving that out, just as long as it focuses on the first things I mentioned. But Thor doesn't have any one of them.

I think Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddelston did their best with the material they were given as Thor and Loki respectively. Loki is definitely the better character, being proficient in magic and being adopted. However every time it seems like he's going to turn out to be a complex character, it just doesn't happen. Also, he's reputation as a trickster is told rather than show and he's so incredibly smarmy you'll know he's the villain from the very beginning. I don't hate Thor so much as I'm dissapointed that he doesn't become anything great. He's a hothead with a heart of gold and nothing beyond that. Hemsworth plays him likable enough and he gets a fine scene where he explains the Nine Realms to love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), but I feel unsatisfied. In any case I guess he's (eventually) an okay moral center to latch onto.

There's a total of about four action scenes in Thor. In the first, Thor, Loki, Sif, and the Warriors Three fight the Frost Giants in Jotunheim. The Frost Giants are boring, and it's hard to believe that their entire species would live on a world so dark and lacking in any evidence of civilization.
Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) strips his son Thor of his armor and sends him and his hammer Mjolnir hurtling to Midgard (played by Earth) so that he may learn his lesson. Thor infiltrates a small S.H.I.E.L.D. base set up around Mjolnir's landing spot to get his weapon back and punches some mooks. These first action scenes are hindered by awkward cuts and close shots. Then there's the Destroyer battle, which sees the titular metal giant stopped by a sword through its spine, a spine it wouldn't actually make sense to have. The underwhelming climax has Thor fighting Loki and stuff blowing up.

Throughout all of this, Thor never truly becomes what I would call a superhero. He is never acknowledged in the public eye. Everything he does revolves around him. Saving a suspiciously film set-looking town from the Destroyer isn't enough to convince me that Thor has ""learned his lesson"". It was refreshing that he was actually willing to sacrifice himself...only for him him to start fighting the thing moments later. He's basically just dumb muscle that S.H.I.E.L.D. can call on.

But what about other stuff?
Like the supporting cast, for instance?
When Thor lands on Earth, he is found and taken in by astrophysicist Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). I really liked Skarsgard's performance. He and Thor get an awesome drinking scene (just about the only genuinely funny scene in the whole movie). Kat Dennings' character seems to exist solely for failed comedic relief. Natalie Portman is completely wasted as a character that endlessly flirts with Thor in a ""you can have me ANY time!"" kind of way (this is supposed to be a believable romance). She makes no impact on Thor's character nor the story.
I couldn't care less about Sif (Jamie Alexander) and the Warriors Three; Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano). I never got a sense of camaraderie between them and Thor, and they do nothing but get smacked around during the Destroyer battle.

On the artistic style: The special effects don't do much to paint a living breathing Asgard. We see no homes or citizens, and it doesn't look like the gods have much to do either. The costume design is usually pretty good, but the armor can look too plastic, and no matter how hard I tried, I simply *could not* take those capes seriously. Did anyone else think that the Destroyer looked just a bit too Power Rangers-y?

So there you have it, Thor failed to accomplish things it absolutely needed to, and failed to accomplish anything else. Is this even a superhero movie? Well, it certainly sucks as a movie.

4577693,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Honestly... just WOW. I saw this a few weeks ago and I'm still shaking from what an incredible movie it was. I tried many times to review it but I gave up each time because I was afraid words wouldn't do the film justice... and now that I've had a bit of time to digest the movie, I guess I can write a review now.

I was stoked about this movie right from the get go. I am a fan of The Avengers, and have seen pretty much every movie that has led up to the upcoming Avengers movie. OK, The Incredible Hulk was tedious and forgettable, but looking past that, I enjoyed Iron man I and II, and when I heard Thor was being made, my excitement level was turned up to 11. Not to mention Captain America is coming this summer, and I am extremely stoked for that movie.

Thor is more of an origin movie than anything else, really- we learn of Thor's past on Asgard, and how he was castout for disrespecting Odin's Honour, and relieved of his powers with the Hammer. We then go to earth, where a group of scientists have found him, study him, and in a way, try to protect him from a rival research group, who have set up an expedition centre surrounding the hammer. Furthermore, Odin is dying, and in this respect, Thor's brother Loki has been handed the throne, thus creating a potential conflict between Earth and Asgard.

Not many people knew of Thor- Thor was a b-list hero in his day, as was Iron Man. But I feel that thanks to this movie, Thor will become the new Iron Man, and it will develop a cult following of its own someday. Kenneth Branagh takes the director's chair here, and manages to produce a very theatrical, shakespearian production. There's even tilted camera shots in this, which gives it a cool 90s Flash vibe. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor, and has adapted his humourous and quirky mannerisms well. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin as well, and Natalie Portman hams it up- in a good way of course, Portman is an incredible actress and really knows how to carry a film.

If I had one complaint, it's the 3D. I would strongly advise against seeing it in 3D- it wasn't filmed in 3D to begin with, it was converted in post. There are a few pretty Asgard shots worthy of the 3D treatment but just a handful of shots isn't enough. It looked flat, and darkened the look of the film.

That being said, this movie is a clear reminder of why we go to the cinema. Branagh has given us a fantastic adaptation of Thor, and has gotten me excited for Captain America and The Avengers. Oh, there's a Jeremy Renner cameo as Hawkeye, and stay through the credits for a great teaser for The Avengers!!!

OVERALL: 10/10

PROS:
-Great acting
-One of the best scripts of 2011
-Awesome cinematography
-Thrilling Action
-Movie is appropriately paced, allowing equal amounts of action and character development

CONS:
-See it in 2D. 98% of the film's shots are unworthy of 3D. There is no depth in the 3D and it looks terribly dull.",1306368000,2,2934,4.400369003690037

Effects are only soso. That ""Bifrost Bridge,"" for example, might have looked awesome before anyone ever played Myst, but looks a bit steampunk by today's standards, and the rest of Asgard rises to the same unimpressive standard. (That assassin-bot was pretty cool, though.) Acting? Well, technically, I suppose that's what you'd call it. Thor and Loki both came across as shallow, childish, and mercurial. In fact, among the Aesir at least, the only one who really interested me was Heimdall. Given such weak central characters, even very good work in the supporting roles (and there was some) couldn't save this.

Branagh's done a fair job with Shakespeare's work. That skill just doesn't transfer to what should have been a glorious and heroic effect-fest. I don't recommend this one.

4577698,4,B0055EAJ7A,"When I first heard that the comic-book Thor was in line for cinematic treatment, I shuddered to think how truly awful that film would be. I assumed it would be hokey beyond compare, as the comic itself often is, and the announcement of Kenneth Branagh as director mollified my fears only slightly. So I was beyond pleased to see a film that actually took itself seriously, rose above its source material and gave us a story -- with all-around good performances from the cast -- that we could believe in.

It's a shame, then, that the overall success had to be marred by an overabundance of cheesy special effects and a 3D transference that distracted more than it improved. From the start -- after a brief prelude that gave us a touch of humanity -- the movie presented well the arrogance of Thor, the nobility of Odin and the secretiveness of Loki ... and it looked more like a video game than a film. And it was good -- if I was talking about a video game, I'm be impressed and singing its praises. But as a movie -- the look was disappointing.

For our pan-dimensional Norse gods, the beginning of the movie involves a host of fighting on a very large scale. First, there's a war on Earth, then Thor's ill-conceived journey to Jotunheim, with six gods against the full might of the frost giants. Then Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who's been working out since his memorable appearance on Star Trek) oversteps his bounds and is hurled to Earth for his hubris -- stripped of his powers and his magical hammer Mjolnir -- to learn humility. Then Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is incapacitated, leaving his dark son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to rule in his place. And Loki, who was second choice to succeed the All-Father, wants to be sure Thor is never coming home.

Meanwhile, on Earth, Thor makes the abrupt, bruising acquaintance of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her storm-chasing team, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). But when mystical hammers fall from the sky and imbed themselves, Excalibur-like, in the rock, you can be sure government spooks will soon be involved. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) follows up his abrupt departure from Iron Man 2 to lead the operation here. He probably wasn't expecting to encounter a mindless Norse simulacrum that belches flame.

Hemsworth has the difficult task of embodying a diety, and he handles the arrogance and power of his position well. Some might think he adapts to well and to easily to the modern human world he finds himself in, but I guess some guys will do just about anything for Portman. Sadly, although she too displays her usual skill, the romance between them feels flat, motivated by little more than, well, they're both hot, they're both there and there's no much else to do in a small New Mexico town.

Back in Asgard, Hiddleston plays Loki as cooly, deliciously evil. But the big battle we all know is coming at the end looks and feels fake. Again, we're back to Thor's video-game world, and it throws the audience right out of the film.

All in all, Thor succeeds more when it's working on a human level -- less flash, more substance. Still, the movie works simply because it's fun, and sometimes that's all you need in a comic-book movie. Score another one for Marvel.

4577699,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001C08RHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B00005JKCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>. That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.

Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Noon/dp/B0016MLIKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Noon</a>-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.

Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgrd gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than ""Bridesmaids"".",1305590400,2,3639,5.724584103512015
4577700,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Who would have thought? One of Marvel's more difficult challenges to bring to the live action film turns out to be their best effort since the first Iron Man film. I know purist will have a hard time with Dr. Donald Blake not being anymore than a name and nothing to do with the God of Thunder here, but with the way this film ended, I can see an interesting way to introduce him as he should be.

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

 Now that the bridge from Asgard to Earth has been destroyed, maybe the only way for Thor to return to earth is to project his being into a earthling who is worthy?  and that someone will need a a certain item to conjure up the Norse God.(a staff maybe?) It would be nice if they could introduce Blake as Thor's alter ego to add some dimension to the role and give ""old goldilocks"" a breather.

******END OF SPOILER******

Now on to the film, it works! Mainly because the three H's (main actors) are exceptional in their roles. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins are completely committed to their roles and they pull off what could have been a disaster. Portman is also very good, but I didn't feel she was irreplaceable, though quite nice to look at, she isn't given as much to do as she could have been if Thor's alter ego was involved.

The action is great, but a little too sparse for my taste, with Thor's Mjolnir his impressive weapon of choice. I'm glad that they did use some of his signature uses such as the helicopter spinning hammer and various others.

Hemsworth seems born for the role and I can't wait to see The Avengers movie..... as for Captain America? well, I am having a hard time with Chris Evans in the title role after he completely owned his role as the Human Torch. I'm mean really? wasn't there another blonde-ish guy with a great physique they could find to play Captain America? He seems a little boy-ish to be playing Cap. I guess I'll have my answers in a couple of months.

Thor isn't perfect, but it is everything it needs to be and more. It is one of the most entertaining comic book films of all time. I saw this at IMAX in 3-D and it looked great, I'm not completely sold on 3-D, but it has improved a great deal.",1305590400,4,2171,4.340740740740741
4577701,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Very interesting movie.  In spite of several misrepresentations, it was good, even humorous, to see the many distortions from the Sagas.  First was the loss of Odin's eye.  That was not a war wound, but a freely given sacrifice to gain insight and wisdom.  When you see Odin in the movie, he lacks his constant companions, the two great wolves, Geri and Freki, and his ravens, Huginn and Muninn.

Thor is red haired, not blond. In the movie, he rides to the Byfrost gate on a horse, not in his chariot, driven by two great goats.  Most may fail to find the humor in Thor's request at the pet store for a dog or cat big enough to ride, but such creatures are very present in Norse legends. It would have been a very reasonable request for him.  It was one of the best parts of the show, if you know the background.

In the film, Sif seems to fully understand Thor's love for a human woman. Sif is Thor's wife!  Could a even a goddess show such ""understanding""?  Thor will never be the ""King"". He, and his father, are doomed to fall together in the final battle, Ragnarok, to save the universe.

All in all, a great entertainment movie, but it has many ""glitches"".

This is obviously a ""comic book"" rendition.  In the future, someone may have the backing, and backbone, to tell the ssgas correctly.

The great power of the Norse Religion, is the fact that of all the gods humans have ever worshiped, only the sir and their kin the Vanir, have to face the prospect of failure and death.

4577702,5,B0055EAJ7A,"You get a feeling sometimes, a feeling of hopelessness as summer comes along, the same old stuff in new package is in 3D, sometimes it explodes a lot, but most of the times it is, inevitably, crap. Talking about movies of course. And other times, you get a really good summer blockbuster. Thor belongs to the latter category.

Summer blockbusters have traditionally been a money-fest, rushed 3D releases with lot of lacklustre performances and lots of explosions to keep the popcorn cracking. Very few directors try to take the next step in actually weaving in a good movie storyline or plot or inspire their actors to at least deliver their lines properly. Kenneth Branagh is one director who does all those things. And more.

It seems Hollywood and comic-book movies have found their ticket to ultimate success. Hire an English director, get a non-American actor and make producers shell out lots and lots of money. But there is something different about Thor, making it unique from recent super-hero movies which have performed commendably. It is hard to point out that abstract something, so I will list all the good things about the movie and hopefully imbibe you with that intangible quality the movie possesses.

Firstly, Asgard's design. We have come across many CGI landscapes and planets now, but nothing the computer animators have ever made (with an exception of Pandora) comes even close to Asgard's design. This is the ultimate fix for an escapism--junkee. I felt Asgard was a separate entity of the movie, in all its glory, shining like a beacon of hope for good movies. It looked so great that the scenes taking place in Midgard (Earth) felt like they were biting into the movie minutes, long minutes when they could have offered more of Asgard. One of the few things I'll ever criticise as ""There is just not enough of it"".

Now the acting. Chris Hemsworth really brings the Norse God of Thunder into life and coats him with a sense of inexplicable charm. Every scene that he is in, especially the ones with the costume on, is transformed from mundane to exquisite art. Anthony Hopkins is the obvious highlight. I think I can safely say that calling the actor the highlight of a movie is like calling chicken the highlight of Chicken Steak. If there was ever an Odin, he was Anthony Hopkins. Tom Hiddleston completes the trio of awesomeness with his wit and talent as the mischievous Loki. At times, he felt like the main character of the movie.

A minor gripe is that the supporting characters were not given enough highlight. Idris Elba brought his own as Heimdall, every delivery worth every cent I paid. I think Kat Dennings' lines were humourous, Skargard played an amazing character. Last but not the least, Natalie Portman, was good, but her talent felt a bit underused here. Sure, as the female lead in a pre-dominantly male super-hero movie, you don't get much focus, but she was a fresh Oscar winner, guys! Give her emotional lines!

Lastly the direction. This is where it gets fun. Mr. Branagh is director of Shakespearean plays. If any director, after seeing this movies says ""This is exactly how I would have done"", I would say ""Don't kid yourself"". Branagh is the next Nolan and that is saying something. Converting the well-set movie universe with down-to-earth scientific and technological aspects into one which had Thor, Odin and Asgard (gods and magic) was a Herculean task, as evidenced from the development hell the movie went through. I would say no-one was a better choice than Branagh, and I fear after making Thor, there is nowhere to go but down for Mr. Branagh. Prove me wrong, man! (Hopefully he does all the Thor movies). This guy is so good, in fact, that I can't wait for people to bitch about how he got snubbed at the Oscars. That's really saying something.

And the 3D? Go  for it! This is not your average money-making gimmick. The action sequences, already phenomenal and gargantuan, really shine in the 3D. All the shots of Asgard get a new dimension of depth as well as reality with the third dimension.

A must-see for everyone.

The Australian actor, Chris Hemsworth, does such an awesome and convincing job as The Mighty Thor from Asgard, that all the exceptional talent surrounding him only brings the picture from already Grade A quality to Grade A+ quality. Natalie Portman was perfectly cast, as was Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo (as Thor's mother, Frigga), and Tom Hiddleston (as Thor's brother, Loki). And let's not forget the powerful presence of the almost-unrecognizable Sir Anthony Hopkins as Thor's father, King Odin.

The arrogant and careless, Thor, is cast out of Asgard and sent to live with humans on earth, where he falls in love, finds compassion and understanding within himself, and becomes the defender of humans. But ultimately, he must defend his world of Asgard against the evil Frost Giants.

""Thor"" is an awesome and fun time for the whole family, 13 years and up, depending on maturity level.

Well done and kudos to all! FIVE STARS! *****",1305072000,6,1573,4.5836298932384345

The story is quite predictable which might not be bad for which is based on a comic.

No regret for spending time and money for it.

The action sequences are good.

They have chosen a good actor for Thor. He does look like the Thor I can imagine of.",1305072000,,280,4.12962962962963
4577710,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I recently saw ""Thor"", and really enjoyed it. It had well-drawn characters, good action, and imaginative production design. I also liked the way that it was sit-up-and-take-notice epic yet also surprisingly intimate. The characters genuinely mattered here, which always makes a summer blockbuster better. With the big summer movies, it's not all about the special effects, and never has been.

One thing made me smile, though. In the old ""Thor"" comics, which debuted in the early 1960's, Marvel's story conceit was that, ""hey, you know what-- Thor, Loki, and all the other mythical Norse gods were actually real, and here are new stories about them!"" And the comic book took off, still being published to this day. To my knowledge, no one at Marvel worried, at least with any fervor, that certain groups of people (like Catholics, southern Baptists, devout Jews etc.) might be offended by the notion that the Judeo-Christian God was apparenly being rejected, by a kid's comic book no less, as the only true God out there.

Oh, one thing Marvel did eventually do was insert a scene like the following into the comic book every fifty or sixty issues or so:

Catholic priest: Thor, thank you for rescuing all our students from their burning school! You're a true hero, even though your very existence flies in the face of the Christian beliefs I hold so dear in my heart!

Thor: Verily, thou should not allow thy heart to be troubled, good Father! Thor and his compatriots in noble Asgard have never claimed to be the ultimate forces in the universe. The noble idea of your own Christian God watching us all from above is one that indeed comforts the denizens of Asgard.

Catholic priest: (walking away, faith restored) God bless you, Thor!

So, you see? At least Marvel threw a small bone to traditional religion by noting that even though the Norse gods were real in Marvel's comic book universe, they didn't claim ultimate supremacy. And that seemed to placate the occasional Marvel editor who presumably was concerned about some kind of backlash from traditional religious quarters, a backlash that never really occured, as far as I know.

So, what made me smile in the movie? It seems, almost fifty years after Thor's debut in the comics, now there WAS some genuine worry about offending people with the notion of pagan gods being presented as real beings, or at least as wholesome movie heroes. The movie, you see, goes out of its way to convert the comic book's mystical, magical realm of Asgard, the home of Thor and the Norse gods, into a realm of technological, scientific wonderment instead, with Thor and his compatriots being presented as simply noble, technologically advanced, long-lived beings from another world (albeit with a proclivity for Shakespearean-type dialogue) who were only PERCEIVED as gods when they visited the ancient Norsemen on Earth centuries ago.

I mean, it all still works in the movie, and in some ways things are more interesting than they were in the comic book. For example, in the original comics, Bifrost, the majestic, magical Rainbow Bridge that connects Asgard to the physical universe, was just that: a rainbow. Epic, but kind of bland. In the movie, the rainbow bridge is a mighty engineering achievement, crackling with powerful electricity under its ever-churning rainbow coloration, and which connects to a sharp-looking, golden transport chamber, which can shoot Thor and his fellow warriors to any point in the universe. Much more fun.

But, yeah, it made me smile that it was probably Hollywood cynicism and fear that for once resulted in better, more interesting story and production elements in the final film. That's not something you see every day.

Anyway, Thor is worth a trip to the movies. Its epic grandeur and entertaining, charismatic characters are definitely worth catching on the big screen.",1305072000,3,3857,4.984447900466563
4577711,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorite Marvel Comic movies! There is never a dull moment, and is filled with action, comedy, suspense and Norse Mythology. The city of Asgard is beautiful. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for the role as Thor!

Thor is about to become King of Asgard, until Frost Giants ruin the ceremony. When Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront the leader, Odin takes away Thor's powers and sends him to Earth, where he comes across a beautiful scientist named Jane Foster. 50 miles away from the town is Thor's mighty hammer, Mjolnir, which no one can pick up. Until Thor becomes worthy, he won't be able to pick up his hammer.

Back on Asgard, Loki becomes the new King, and sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor. Will Thor be able to save the town without his powers? If you want an awesomely epic superhero movie, you'll love THOR!!!",1304985600,,880,4.528301886792453
4577712,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is based on a lesser-known character from the Marvel Comics line. Thor is undisciplined and therefore his father, the king, is reluctant to see him ascend to the throne. Thor is thrust into another realm, in this case, earth, where he encounters some scientists.  A romantic connection ensues between him and the lead scientist, played by Natalie Portman. The visuals in this film are stunning and the 3D effect enhances them. However, this film is more than just a comic superhero movie. There are elements of romance, comedy, and drama present, making this a motion picture that will appeal to all audiences.",1304985600,,615,4.970873786407767
4577713,4,B0055EAJ7A,"In Thor, we are presented with an otherworldly hero of extreme power who hails from the planet Asgard. Thanks to his reckless arrogance, he is stripped of his strength and cast out from his home world, forced to live as a mere mortal on the planet known as Earth. Before he can regain his hammer and his power, he must overcome his faults, thus proving that he is fit to be king. Thor's comic book plot and over-the-top fantasy could have made it unrelatable, but Chris Hemsworth's grounding performance saves it from such a fate. He's chiseled enough to fill schoolgirls' dreams, but more importantly, he really nails this role. He manages to be spoiled and conceited, yet charming. He is a powerful prince and warrior but somehow hilarious. By the end of the film, he's the kind of hero you love to root for. And then there's Natalie Portman, every nerd's dream. She's as cute as always here, but unfortunately her character is not particularly relevant.

In fact, Earth itself isn't particularly relevant. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard, the Asgardians are the main characters, and all the drama and conflict is between their world and J&ouml;tunheim, land of the evil frost giants. Earth is involved only tangentially, connected to these other realms by Yggdrasil, the world tree. A whole bunch of mythology is thrown at us, and though I tried my best to catch it, a great deal went over my head. Although I liked all the Asgardians simply because they were attractive and wore shiny clothing, I found it a bit hard to care about them when my old standby, humanity, was left out of the mix. I mean, Earth is never even in any danger! The trailers make it look like all sorts of evil creatures are going to start flooding our cities, threatening to destroy us with robots that shoot fire from their faces. In reality, only one villain ever comes to Earth to destroy anything. And in fact, its only purpose is to capture Thor--it's got nothing against us puny humans!

And man are we puny. Natalie Portman's apprentice tazes Thor, but that's about the most any of us evolved apes does. Portman herself is just in the movie as a shallow love interest to fulfill the hero-learns-humility-by-falling-in-love trope. Not to say that I wouldn't fall for her immediately, but Thor spends only one or two days on Earth, and there are very few scenes of him and Portman interacting at all. He does appeal to the scientist in her, however, saying ""The answers you seek shall be yours, once I claim what is mine."" (Which, incidentally, is how I'm going to be hitting on all women from now on.) Their romance just didn't hold water for me, especially since [Minor Spoiler Alert] the movie ends with them worlds apart, longing for each other. There simply wasn't enough time for their relationship to go from whirlwind romance to the ""I'll spend my life searching for a way to travel through space so we can be together"" phase. [End Spoiler Alert]

While those faults keep this movie from achieving true greatness, they certainly don't prevent it from being basically awesome. Thor is a great character, the other worlds are breathtaking, and there's a good balance of action and comedy. Plus, Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard, is undeniably badass; he wields a giant golden sword, sports a matching horned helmet, and has bright orange eyes that can see across the cosmos. Also, he's literally immune to being frozen to death.

The only actually bad part of the movie was when Thor supposedly dies. [Spoiler Alert] The main character DOES NOT DIE! I know it's shocking, but it's the truth. He's lying there, all dead like, and the camera just keeps lingering and lingering on a close up of his face. Finally, he grabs his hammer and surges back to life, more powerful than ever now that he's proven he's willing to sacrifice himself. The moment is painfully cheesy, and yet, somehow, I found myself cheering. [End Spoiler Alert]

When it comes down to it, Thor is your basic superhero movie. Even though it's not too original and there's little sense of danger, the characters are eminently likable, the CGI is stunning, and the action is fun. It's a lighthearted film, and  unless you try to follow the mythology of it all, you won't have to think too hard.

3.5/5 

Most worthless character: Hogun, the token Asian Warrior. All he did was repeat what the other characters were saying in a much more ominous, Asian-y way.

The acting was very good, especially Christ Hemsworth(Thor) and Natalie Portman(Jane).Although you could see this in regular 2D, it would make it even better if you saw it in 3D. I saw it in 3D and I thought that they used 3D technology really well( especially when they were in Asgard). So my suggestion to you is to actually listen to the critics(78 percent have given Thor a good review on RottenTomatoes.com)and go to movies or buy the DVD when it comes out. I know that I will definetly add this to my movie collection in the near future.",1304985600,,650,4.46218487394958
4577715,5,B0055EAJ7A,"And so begins the summer; not with a whimper, but with a bang. Yes, Kenneth Branagh's super-hero epic has arrived, and it's... really quite good, actually, provided you just put your brain into neutral and let the sheer energy of it all roll over you.

The story tells the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who is certainly not the worst-looking man ever filmed), a young Asgardian about to be made heir to the throne by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins). In the background his younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who looks very familiar despite my not having seen him in anything before), seethes with jealousy. During the ceremony to invest Thor with his titles, the Frost Giants attack, trying to steal a device that was taken from them after the last war between Jotunheim and Asgard. They're stopped, but Thor vows revenge. He rounds up his friends, crosses Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, and launches an ill-fated attack. In the end, war is declared and Odin, who had hoped to maintain peace, is forced to send his son into exile on Earth.

Now that story alone could have made for an interesting film, but that's only the first act. After arriving on Earth, Thor meets up with an astrophysicist (Natale Portman, whose own scientific background lends her credibility to this role). He's lost his powers and lost his way. The two quickly bond and, well, you know where that's heading. Meantime, SHIELD is investigating a mysterious, unmovable hammer that seems to have dropped out of the sky and hit the ground hard in New Mexico...

Like I said, I really enjoyed this movie. There's quite a lot of humor, lots of action and wonderful acting. Idris Elba, who plays Heimdal, is the real revelation here, as he does an exceptional job in what's really a fairly small role. The story also does an excellent job incorporating the various elements of Norse mythology. As both a super hero fan and a mythology fan, I really appreciated seeing the version of Asgard that was put up onto the screen.

I must say, aside from some of the overall silliness of the story, I can't find much anything to complain about, though the movie seems to sort of just stop rather than actually end. It was wildly entertaining and the brief appearances by the likes of Hawkeye and Nick Fury, both of them there to help set up next year's Avengers film, were enough to make the fanboy in me make all sorts of happy noises. I really cannot recommend this movie enough, and if this is what the other summer super hero movies have in store for us, well, we're set for a great summer!",1304985600,2,2559,4.654867256637168

Even though the costume was WAAAAAYYY wrong in The Incredible Hulk Returns, Eric Kramer was a much better Thor than this guy. If you have already seen this and enjoyed it I won't dispute your opinion, but if you are like me with a basic knowledge of the Thor character and his comic book and/or cartoon mythology this one may just disappoint.",1304899200,2,690,4.3984375
4577717,5,B0055EAJ7A,"The Review:

The last several years have seen a renaissance of the superhero movie and there's never been a better time to be a comic book fanboy.  This is in no small part due to Marvel Studios pulling out all the stops in its efforts to bring its stellar list of heroes and rogues to the big screen.  Now it's Thor's turn and it lives up to the hype.  It brings a cosmic element to the Marvel films and conitinues setting the stage for next year's Avengers movie.  Thor is action packed, and has stellar performances that showcase a tremendously talented cast.

Directed by Kenneth Brannaugh and starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor overcame a lot of naysayers who questioned how Thor would fare on the big screen.  Marvel has tweeked and updated Thor's origins to better suit the 21st centrury audience. In the comics Thor is the Norse god of thunder who wields the magical hammer called Mjolnir.  In his movie incarnation, Thor and his fellow ""gods"" are actually super advanced beings, who as Thor explains, come from, Asgard, a place where science and magic are one and the same.  We mortals dwell in the realm of Midgard, one of the nine known realms.  The frost giants of Jutenheim have been at war with Asgard for a millenium.  That war occasionally spilled out to Midgard and the Asgardians led by Odin defended our primitive ancestors, who perceived the Asgardians as gods.

In our time Thor Odinson is a brash young god, hier to the throne of Asgard.  He's Asgard's greatest warrior, but he is also arrogant and headstrong.  Thor's rash actions result in his banishment to Midgard, where he is powerless, but not helpless, while back home Thor's dysfunctional family is engaged in cosmic political intrigue with consequences on an interplanetary scale.  Fantastic special effects and art direction bring the story to life.  Besides its amazing action sequences, Thor succeeds in bringing Asgard, home of the gods to gleaming life.  Part of the set was on on display at the San Diego 2010 Comicon, which was impressive, but on the big screen it's truly unique and awesome.  When you see the halls of Asgard for the first time you will be suitably impressed.

The film is split equally between the more cosmic settings of Asgard and Jutenheim and the more mundane Midgard.  I've seen some reviews that have taken issue with the lack of action in the more earthbound parts of the movie, and I could not disagree more as much of this is devoted to genuine character development.  Thor is not an ideal hero, and in true Marvel tradition he has his faults, which in his case, are arrogance and rushing into things with a disregard for the consequences of his actions.  Thor's actions while he's grounded on earth are some of the most entertaining parts of the movie.  It provides for some comic relief and genuinely funny moments as a six and a half foot god used to flying from place to place has to cope with hitching a ride like us mere mortals.

Finally, the performances are worth a special mention.  The actors here all brought their A-game. Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and is now as synonymous with this character as Robert Downey Jr. is with Tony Stark.  Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Odin is brilliant and he steals scenes like a master thief. Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki, also does a tremendous job.  As with all modern Marvel movies, stick around until after the credits roll. There's always an important scene that sets the stage for the next movie.

Thor is a winner and has set a thunderous pace for the summer movie season. Fortunately, Marvel will mostly be competing against itself with the impending release of X-men First Class and Captain America.",1304899200,2,3736,4.741486068111455
4577718,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Background

Firstly it should be noted that Thursday is derived from an Old English word, which effectively meant: ""Thunor's Day"". This in turn was influenced from another Old Norse word which effectively has the meaning ""Thor's Day"". In Germanic paganism, Thor is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, destruction, fertility, healing, and the protection of mankind.

In the early 1960s Marvel Comics introduced Thor into their line up of fictional superheroes. The Norse mythology character made appearances in several publications, and he became a member of the superhero team the Avengers. It is based on this comic book character that this film was produced. Next year, this character will also be featured in film called the Avengers.

The Actors

Veteran actor Anthony Hopkins takes up the role as Odin. This was an excellent choice. His role was somewhat similar to his role in Beowulf. Natalie Portman (Best Actress Oscar winner 2010) plays Jane Foster, Thor's eventual earth bound sweetheart. The rest of the cast including Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are not as well known, however, their performances are quite acceptable.

Storyline

Odin has a secret, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is not really his son. His real roots end up making him a pretty nasty bad guy, which he portrays quite well. The action unfolds on Earth, Asgard and on another world where there was an ancient war. The sets are very well designed (and loaded with tons of computer graphics, especially Asgard). Thor develops and matures during this story. It is really a very extensive case of sibling rivalry.

Conclusion

This film is quite enjoyable, but you get the feeling that something was missing. This maybe because a lot of time was spent trying to establish the whole concept of realm of Asgard. However, it makes a good launch pad for next year's Avengers Movie. There is a lot of drama elements included, but this seems to have taken the edge off of the action sequences.",1304899200,2,1999,5.054711246200608
4577719,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Judging by the trailers, I thought Thor would be a complete mess. Then I began reading some very positive reviews and that was enough to get me to fork over the $11.00 to see it in IMAX 3-D.

I wasn't amazed by it, but I didn't feel I wasted my money either. The story was okay, though somewhat laughable at times (I knew the source material would be hard to convert to a film without sounding cheesy), the acting was good and the CGI was adequate. Maybe it was the 3-D, but some of the visuals looked blurry or flat out cheaply done. I almost didn't see it in 3-D because it was done after the fact, but most critics had said that it was used properly for a change.

There are a couple of mentions that link this character with the other heroes for the upcoming Avengers movie, which was sort of neat in Iron Man and Iron Man 2, but now it seems like just a ploy to hype up that future film. We get it.

Thor is fun while it lasts but ultimately ranks somewhere in the middle of comic book adaptations. There is nothing to really hate about it, but there is also nothing memorable enough to warrant a sequel or repeat viewings.

4577720,5,B0055EAJ7A,"(I am not a fan of the former Thor comics, so this review is based solely on the movie.)

I LOVED IT!  I saw Thor in the theater in 3D and it was wonderful.  It was excellent in 3D and on the big screen, so if you get a chance, catch it while it is still in theaters.

Natalie Portman, and several others, are in a desert area looking for lights in the sky when they see a huge tornado-like funnel.  They start driving to get away when SMACK!--Natalie runs right into Chris Hemsworth.  She did not know he had just fallen from the sky, crashing to earth.

We jump back in time to find that Thor was the 1st son of King Odin of Asgarth and heir to the throne.  Although King Odin had brought peace to the Universe, the bad guys were still waiting to get revenge.  Right before Thor can be pronounced King, the bad guys attack.  The King forbids Thor to go after them, but he disobeys and is banished to earth, where he meets Natalie.

Of course, the plot thickens and we learn of the lies and deception from power hungry beings.  Sir Anthony Hopkins plays an outstanding role throughout the movie(as always) as King Odin.  Renee Russo (whom you may remember from the Lethal Weapon flicks) plays the Queen.

This is an inter-planetary action plot with lots of action scenes (fighting/blowing up).  The CGI is awesome!  We even have a rainbow bridge portal from one area of the universe to another.  Stay with the flick when it ends and watch the shots of the universe while the credits are showing, too.  They are also awesome.",1304812800,,1525,4.366548042704626
4577721,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I just got back from seeing Thor and thought it a fantastic yet emotional film, even better than Spider-man 2 or Iron-Man (two other excellent Marvel outings).

Plots:

I won't go too much into plot summary since that has already been done by other critics and writers on this site.  I will say that the general themes of arrogance and betrayal give way to love and honor in a way that I've only read in the actual Thor comics.

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, many years ago now, created their Marvel version of Norse mythology with Thor -- a brash, arrogant son of the mighty Odin (well-played by Anthony Hopkins).  The comics painted Thor as a man-god in dire need of humility.  And of Loki, adopted son, whose distinctive black hair and clever manner portend the story -- a jealous son who only desires the pride of his father.

Father and Son:

It has been pointed out that this is a father/son story.  True, but I'd take that a step further and say it's a story of family.  Odin, regardless of being the most powerful being in the Nine Worlds (yes, initial caps!) has two boys to take care of, to groom to be worthy of king.

Thor, after screwing up with the Frost Giants' world, is banished to Earth. There we meet Jane Foster, a scientist studying the wormholes she suspects are there, and her friend Darcy who is studying Thor's abs.

Humor:

There is enough to go around but is certainly not the slapstick humor of the Green Hornet film!  Loki's apparent regard for his father and the build-up of his betrayal was well-played and smooth.

Thor's now-depowered body takes a beating and he finally comes to realize his own faults and arrogance.  But his dealings with the hospital staff, his fights with SHIELD, and his growing friendship with Jane, show that he is human after all.

Fights:

The Frost Giant's battle, the defeat of the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall, and the camaraderie and battle with the other comics characters (Sif, and the Warriors Three) were nearly directly out of the comics story, but it was not ""comic bookie"" if you know what I mean.  Not a lot of explosions, just some honest swordplay and kick-butt action!

Easter Eggs:

Only fans would have spotted a few things that are not a deep part of the story at all, but just a nod to fans.  The first man to try to pull the magical hammer, Mjolnir, from the ground was none other than J. Michael Stracynski, author of this film (whose been writing some great comics scripts lately and is also author of the former TV series, Babylon 5).  Another is the inevitable Stan Lee appearance.  And Jane Foster's former boyfriend (only mentioned,  never seen) is ""Donald Blake"" *(which is the comics was Thor's alter-ego).

There's a scene after the credits are done.  Be sure you wait for it.  The excellent soundtrack will keep you rocking up to that point.

Changes:

I really appreciate a film that does not require early comics knowledge to understand what's going on.  I truly feel anyone who enjoys some decent fantasy, with its codes of honor and loyalty will greatly love this film.  There are several changes from the comics, but it does not matter.  It's all good!

Bottom Line:

Straightforward, not too pretentious.  We get our quota of subtle bad guys, unstoppable forces and immovable objects, and the story moves along without being rushed or having any real boring pauses.  I mean even Thor makes breakfast!  A must-see.

4577722,4,B0055EAJ7A,"As Marvel continues their quest to create an entire film universe for their heroes to run around in, their latest effort at expanding this ever-growing library involves the god of thunder himself, Thor.  Compared to many other comic book hero films that have come out over the past several years, can ""Thor"" stand up?

""Thor"" follows the titular god of thunder, and his mischievous brother Loki.  On the day of his ascension to the throne of Asgard, fabled home of the Norse gods, an old enemy manages to infiltrate Asgard and nearly make away with a dangerous weapon.  Overreacting, Thor sets out to prove his worth, only to set in motion a disastrous series of events that could lead to a mythological war, and his own permanent exile from those he loves.

Unlike the other films set in the Marvel Universe, ""Thor"" takes a heavy mythological route with it's story, which is a tried-and-true ""Fish out of water/Coming of age"" story.  While the plot itself is predictable, the movie benefits from it's production values and a good sense of humor.  Marvel put a lot of time, effort, and resources into the film, and it shows:  Asgard is big and beautiful, easily a realm of gods, and the costumes, weapons, and creatures are beautiful to look at.  And to make things even better, ""Thor"" has a great sense of humor, with some very funny jokes fitting into the theme of Thor being out of his element on Earth, especially with a scene set in a pet store.

However, Thor does suffer somewhat from being a bit short.  While the film has a run time close to two hours, the second and third acts of the film move from one beat to the next at close to breakneck speed.  By the time the film finishes, it's hard to believe that's it's actually done, leaving the feeling that there's too much story crammed into too short a running time.

But despite it's pacing issues, ""Thor"" is an excellent comic-book film that features a large mythological scope, great comedy, high production values, and engaging action.  All of it combines to create a film that, while slightly overstuffed, is still great fun, and well worth watching, making it arguably one of the better Marvel films to date.",1304812800,,2174,4.657068062827225
4577723,5,B0055EAJ7A,"By all rights this movie should be a huge flop.  It's essentially a costume drama set in modern day, a sword- and-sorcery-in-the-stone epic with Thor as Arthur and Mjolnir as Excalibur. But much to my surprise, Thor is a hilarious monster-bashing fish-out-of-water tale with a six-foot-tall chiseled Viking at its center.

There's so many things about Thor that shouldn't work but do: he wields a hammer that boomerangs back into his hand, that he can spin at high speed to whip up a whirlwind, that allows him to fly, and that can only be wielded by someone worthy.  This is a hammer we're talking about.

There are some concessions to make the film palatable to non-comic fans, but they are surprisingly few.  Thor (chiseled-from-rock Chris Hemsworth) has no alter ego -- although the film takes a stab at creating a hilariously useless cover identity for him that matches his disabled persona in the comics; Asgard is meticulously explained as a highly advanced scientific civilization from the stars; and a considerably diminished Thor returns to Earth.  But everything else - the epaulets, the bright red cloak, the ""forsooth""s and ""thou""s -- are all here in their glorious cheesiness.

Director Kenneth Branagh knew exactly what he was doing when he collared Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga, and Natalie Portman as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Branagh makes Thor palatable by highlighting the very ridiculous nature of it all. Thor gets run over, tasered, and beaten up multiple times to demonstrate that Thor is learning a lesson of humility. And who doesn't want to see a gorgeous white alien (a Nordic?) with bulging muscles get a great big heaping of humble pie?

The action flickers back and forth between Asgard where Loki (a sneering Tom Hiddleston) and frost giants plot Asgard's downfall, and Earth where Foster struggles to convince everyone that large, sustainable Einstein-Rosen bridges are real.  This conveniently explains the Bifrost Bridge, because both titles have the word bridge in it.  Although Foster has been upgraded from her role as a nurse in the comics to an astrophysicist in the movie, her scientific contribution is solely to complain about the government taking her analysis equipment, make goo-goo eyes at Thor, and look pretty. If there's a flaw in this movie it's that Foster's relationship with Thor is too brief. It's hard to believe an Asgardian deity would swear to return to defend Earth solely because of one dreamy night spent on a rooftop gazing at the stars. Then again, I just used the words ""hard to believe"" and ""Asgardian deity"" in the same sentence.

There are a host of ancillary characters and all of them provide humorous contributions. There's dour Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who grabs a bow instead of a sniper rifle; warrior maiden Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three (Josh Dallas as Fandral, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Ray Stevenson as Volstagg) who are described as ""Jackie Chan, Robin Hood, and Xena""; and best of all there's Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) a political science major intern (""the only one who applied,"" mutters Foster) who knows nothing about Nordic myth and mishears ""Mjolnir"" as ""meow-meow.""  That line still cracks me up.

Thor is essentially what happens if a Dungeons & Dragons character walked off a character sheet and stepped onto Earth for a jaunt. I learned a lot about how to correctly pronounce Nordic phrases I've been mispronouncing for two decades, learned absolutely nothing about Einstein-Rosen bridges, and loved every minute of it.  With its clever mix of drama, myth, and superhero sensibility, Thor knocks it out of the park...with a hammer.",1304812800,9,3658,5.054817275747508
4577724,5,B0055EAJ7A,"I agree with all the praise everyone has already heaped on this movie. it is the best.  I'm an old fanboy and I couldn't wipe the silly grin off my face for the whole movie.  All I'll add is if you have the chance to see this in 3D at an IMAX, it's worth every penny.",1304812800,9,267,3.75
4577725,4,B0055EAJ7A,"What a fanboy dream! Shakespearian Actor/director Kenneth Branagh  directing the epic tale of the God of Thunder.

The film tells the story of Thor's exile to Earth or Midguard. To learn how to rule the All Father Odin issues this punishment with the ultimate goal for Thor to lose his hubris and gain so insight before returning to Asgard, but there's more at steak than he or Thor realize. Needless to say the effects, costumes and art direction are all you expect from Marvel.

Chris Hensworth...Dug him as brief appearance as kirk's dad, but he was flipping awesome as Thor! The lovable arrogance, Nordic look and the scary body sculpting made him seem born to play the part... Can't wait to see The character return for Avengers (May 4th, 2012)

And Sir Tony is all ways great I remember being druggies by one of his break out roles in Magic, he even made Wolfman palatable but he was a natural as Odin in Thor!
He deserved to be in the halls of Asgard as do Thor's cohorts.

Great as Loki in Thor! Added more that just the slickness you need for The Trickster god, but made him a sympathetic character too. Interesting looking guy...

Portman is likable as a mortal scientist ( of course ) who aids and reacts appropriately to the shirtless Thor after hitting him with the car, twice. Kat dennings was fun as Portman's sidekick grad assistant. As is Stellan Skarsgard as Prof Selvig (who we shall see next year in the Avengers too).

Watch for comic cameos by Avengers' Hawkeye to Black Panther... And don't forget for you leave early you'll be FURY-ious.
Next stop Captain America...",1304812800,3,1590,4.637010676156583
4577726,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor is Marvel's best superhero movie yet.  It is even better than the first Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk films.  It is also the most visually stunning of any Marvel film, with gorgeous fantasy settings, great costumes, and spectacular special effects.

In the same way as Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight worked just as well as a crime drama as a superhero movie, Thor works just as well as a standalone fantasy film.  Even if I had not known that I was watching a comic book movie, I would have been just as happy with the story.  In fact, I would say that you don't actually need to be familiar with the characters or the comic mythology to enjoy the film.

The story is set half in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and half in our world, Earth.  Thor, the son of the king of Asgard, the wise Odin, is a proud and arrogant king-in-waiting.  He makes a foolish mistake that brings his world to the brink of war and his father exiles him to our world as punishment, and maybe to teach him how to be a better man.  On Earth, Thor makes some new friends and even begins to fall in love with a pretty scientist.  Meanwhile, in Asgard, his brother Loki begins to put into motion a plot that may threaten Thor's home.

Two things about the film really stood out to me.  The first is the absolutely beautiful settings and solid world-building in the movie.  Asgard looks amazing, with settings such as the Rainbow Bridge, a crystal structure with colored lights running through it, spanning a sea that flows into a massive waterfall, cascading down into the open cosmos.  Also, great costuming really makes the gods stand out, and adds to the film's epic feel.  The second thing was the character of Loki, the film's antagonist.  Watching the trailers, I expected a greasy, honorless villain (someone like Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings).  Instead I got the story of a hero, told in reverse.  Loki's story mirrors his brother Thor's, but where Thor starts out as an arrogant royal brat and through his time on Earth comes to realize what it means to be a hero, Loki begins the story as a mischievous but honorable man, and over the course of the film turns into a really bad guy.  As Thor rises, he falls.  And when his final plan is revealed at the end of the film, it totally fits his personality and everything you know about him.  In other superhero films, we're used to seeing the bad guy go on some kind of mindless rampage at the end of the film.  We saw it in The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, the Spider Man movies, the Fantastic Four...but not here.  Loki acts like a man with a purpose.  Actually he has two purposes, both very personal to him.  One is to do commit a terrible act of destruction, partly out of self-loathing and partly out of a twisted sense of honor toward his father.  And the other is simply to beat his brother, proving himself Thor's equal.  He is easily the deepest villain of any of the Marvel films so far.

The film is directed by Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart!), who handles the epic material perfectly.  More than any Marvel film so far, this one focuses on the hero's journey.  Even more than a comic book movie, this is a fantasy film about a hero.  Expect father-son drama, palace intrigue in the realm of the gods, and an epic confrontation between two brothers who have been become very different people over the course of the story.  There is also plenty of humor, with a few real laugh-out-loud moments.  And there is a very sweet, almost cute romance woven into the story.  It carries an innocent, young-love kind of feeling.  It also takes the two characters, one a god more concerned with war and glory, the other a scientist more concerned with solving the mysteries of the universe, and brings them down to earth in their budding love for one another.

I would recommend Thor to any lover of fantasy films, as well as any fans of comic book movies such as Marvel's Avengers lineup.  It is solid fantasy fun with a strong sense of the epic and the heroic.  And when you see Thor finally wield his hammer and summon the lightning, you'll want to stand up and cheer.",1304812800,512,4143,4.489304812834225
4577727,4,B0055EAJ7A,"Thor, the latest superhero flick in Marvel's Avengers property, starts the Thunder God cum comic hero on the path that will lead to him becoming one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  Starring Chris Hemsworth in the title role, it also boasts Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Colm Feore as Laufey, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.  Rounding out the cast are Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, Ray Stevenson, Clark Gregg, Joshua Dallas and Tadanobu Asano.

It opens with Jane Foster and her small team of storm chasers on the trail of the latest in a series of unusual meteorological occurrences and they nearly run a man down in the process.  Flashback to the Dark Ages where Odin narrates a montage explaining the Nine Realms and the Asgardians war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, resulting in a fragile truce.  Skip forward to Thor's ascension day when on the verge of being named Odin's successor a trio of frost giants breaks into the trophy room trying to steal the Cask of Ancient Winters, a powerful jotun artifact taken during the war.  Enraged but ordered by Odin not to retaliate, Thor and his brother Loki, along with their friends Sif, Volstagg, Hodun and Fandral, slip away to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, the frost giant king.  Laufey goads Thor into attacking and only Odin's personal intervention saves the group from destruction, but not before Loki makes a chilling discovery.  Thor challenges his father's inaction and Odin realizes his hotheaded son still has much to learn.  He strips Thor of his power and casts him down to Earth, also sealing away the power of the hammer Mjolnir until Thor is worthy to reclaim it.  Loki confronts Odin about what he's learned- which Odin confesses to- but all the combined stress forces him into the Odinsleep, a hibernation state which replenishes his power.  Acting as regent, Loki devises a scheme that will end the war, as well as serving other purposes.

The script is good with some decent jokes both obvious and insider, but stretches paper thin in some places.  Mostly based upon the Marvel Ultimates storylines it draws references from different aspects of Thor's comic book history, including the creative runs of Walt Simonson, J. Michael Straczynski and Ralph Macchio (no, not that one).  Certain things could've used a little more development or exposition, but that would've gotten in the way of a good SFX shot.  But it does a great job maintaining the Avengers continuity that's being established, as well slipping in an intriguing cameo.  It even ties in the Mjolnir teaser clip from Iron Man 2.  And yeah, you need to stay after the credits for this one as well.

The FX are as good as we've come to expect- mostly.  The frost giant battle has some nice moments with Thor wielding his hammer in classic comic book form- whipping it around to create storm effects as well as the seminal return to his hand after being thrown.  Asgard is modeled on some form of organic technology that works hand in hand with magic making for a shining, heavenly realm that's just a little too perfect.  Golden spires, gleaming halls, burnished armor- paradise never looked so... fake.  The Bifrost Rainbow Bridge looks like a bunch of LiteBrites low on batteries.  And of course, the frost giants have misshapen forms, glowing red eyes and dwell in the eternal chill gloom of Jotunheim.  Why?  Because they're eee-vil.

Chris Hemsworth fills the role like he wrote it himself.  Thor is brash and boastful, even flipping Mjolnir around like it was a toy.  On Earth when he realizes what Odin's done, his angst isn't sappy or whiny, but confused and resolved to make amends.  The best character in the movie is usually the villain, and Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It's Loki's character arc that actually drives the movie; his machinations and personal conflict are engaging: at the risk of being geeky, Loki pulls a Batman Gambit- maneuvering people and events while exploiting everyone's natures to do what he wants, but if it fails...  The only problem is initially he's all over the place, doing things that appear to contradict his goals.  But even then there's clues as to what's going on with him, and the payoff delivers.

Thor's lifelong friends, The Warriors Three- as they identify themselves- are kind of one-dimensional and cartoonish, but then they were often portrayed that way in the comics.  The only one of his buddies that gets any measure of characterization is Sif, for the obvious reason that she may still end up as a potential love interest.

Thor hits all the right notes and should be the first blockbuster of the year.  It does everything it's supposed to and leaves you hungry for more- i.e., Captain America and XMen: First Class.  Can't wait.",1304726400,6,4792,4.857142857142857
4577728,5,B0055EAJ7A,"Look, lower the hammer, I gave it 5 stars.  I was going to give it 5 stars anyway.  Man.
Thor is standing behind me, breathing down my neck.  Luckily, he can't read English.  Oh, drat, he can.  Okay, okay, self ""don't type anything bad about the movie, don't type anything bad about the movie.""  Alright, I'm getting on with it.

The ladies will certainly like this movie, as the actor playing Thor is a well-built hunk of man who is shirtless for about a minute.  (Good, now he's smiling.)  In fact, Chris Hemsworth clearly is the best actor ever to play a comic book character, sorry, um Norse God, alien (what are you again?)  He wants me to write ""being from another realm.""  Okay.  (He's still not smiling.  Probably thinks I went overboard with the ""best actor"" bit.)  Although the character starts off a bit immature (calm down!) about 2/3 into the movie, he becomes a true hero, by any measure of the word (Well, at least he's not frowning, but he's not smiling.  I don't do my best work under duress, you know.)

He is a very honorable character throughout.  Although any human woman would love to be his companion due to his incredible good looks, impressive build, wit, charm, and humor, he takes advantage of no one.  In fact, he won't even take the initiative to kiss a woman on the lips, and charmingly kisses her hand instead.  And he can drink any human male under the table. (Smiling now, wrap it up, quick).

All in all, one of the best comic book films in a long time.  Much better than Green Hornet (don't hit me!)",1304726400,9,1534,4.446043165467626
4577729,5,B0055EAJ7A,"""Thor"" is great! This is how the story goes: Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior, is sent down to Earth as punishment for reigniting a reckless war.
