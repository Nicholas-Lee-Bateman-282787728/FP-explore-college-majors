8301187,5,B001F7Q4KM,"I have pre-ordered this DVD as well as Volume 1 for my nephew. He is almost 4-years old and loves the Magic Cellar series shown on HBO Family. This is a great program for children. It is very educational by teaching children through storytelling about fundamental values. There is a lesson to learn in each of the story episodes that involves the consequences, of not sharing, selfishness, being untruthful, not caring for the nature and the environment, and not being respectful of others in addition to many more. This is the type of programming that you would expect to see on PBS or Noggin.

The episodes in vol. 2 are episodes 6-10. There was no information about each of the episodes above, so I looked online and was able to find a synopsis for each of the Episodes 6-10

Episode 6

Episode 7

The hunter realizes what he has done and returns the stone to the snake and learns not to be selfish.

Episode 8

The lesson: respecting and obedient behavior is rewarded in the end.

Episode 10

The Lion King decides to give all the animals something special to make them unique. He gives Eagle some feathers so it can fly; Elephant receives a long nose and strong tusks; Rhino receives a short, sharp horn; Hyena receives a silly laugh and Zebra receives black and white stripes. The children learn not to regard their outer looks as overly important.

As I wrote in my review for Volume 1; I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with children ages 3-years to 10-years old. The children love it and the stories are great as well as the 3D animation.",1227052800,,2767,4.564516129032258
