724931,5,6303911579,"I bought this tape for my son a few weeks ago, and he has watched it 3-4 times every day since I bought it for him.  He loves the music and all the dancing.  He has learned to say half of the alphabet from just watching the video.  I also see no problem with the way Baby Bear talks.  I know a little girl who talks like that and she gets picked on all the time.  This will show her that there are a other people out there who sometimes talk alittle different.",971136000,5,460,3.903225806451613
724932,5,6303911579,"My daughter loves this video.  She's been watching it for over a year now,  and has known all of her letters since she was 15 months old.  I never felt  guilty for letting her watch her favorite bird teach Baby Bear about the  alphabet since she made it clear she was learning right along with him,  identifying some letters even before she could say them!!
I don't agree  with the comments about Baby Bear's speech impediment, since I think it's  important for kids to see that not everyone learns to speak perfectly right  off, nor does everyone sound the same at any age.  I think it's great that  the folks at CTW make a point of representing different folks in all  aspects of their presentations, and hope my little girl grows up more  tolerant of others because of what she sees in videos like this one.",968630400,16,810,4.465753424657534
724933,3,6303911579,"I too do not care for Baby Bear's speech impediment. In general, Baby Bear is one of the weaker Sesame Street characters. They should stick with  monsters. Otherwise, the video is decent and our kid likes it. She is up to  E at 18 months.",967939200,3,238,4.266666666666667
724934,5,6303911579,"My daughter received this video as a Chrsitmas gift when she was 18 months old. She watches it often, and having just turned two-years old she has  picked up on the rythym of the alphabet quite well.
Most of the video  appears to be clips from other CTW broadcasts that have been edited to make  this video. We like it very much, and feel we have gotten our money's worth  for it.",965433600,3,380,4.236111111111111
724935,5,6303911579,"Forget what the others say about Baby Bear's lisp!  Kids lovehim.  He is the central character in a fun story about the alphabet. If you want your child to be watching an entertaining, giggly 1/2 hour of educational video, buy this one!  He or she may not be saying the alphabet by the end of first viewing, but they will recognize it!  I bought this when my twins were six months old.  They are still spellbound by this video, dancing and laughing, and not by many others--even after twelve months of viewing pleasure.  That's not bad for the life-span of a kid's video at this price.
Thanks again to Sesame Street video.",964396800,11,622,4.508928571428571
724936,5,6303911579,"My son has loved this video since he was 12 months.  He is now 16 month and dances to the songs and trys to say letters.  It is a great way to re-enforce the way you teach the alphabet.
AND IT'S FUN!",951868800,6,199,3.7142857142857144
724937,2,6303911579,"While this video does have catchy songs, i did not like it that much. So far my 3 year old daughter has not learned the alphabet from it, although she watches it very often. This video spends too much time explaining why  the bear wants to learn the alphabet and not enough time actually learning  the alphabet. The video is 30 minutes long and i guess they only spend 15  minutes actually learning the ABCs. Although I have to admit the children  enjoy it very much, for the catchy songs and the familiar characters.
I  suggest Dr. Suess's ABCs. My 4 year old learned the whole alphabet from  watching it just a few times. I also like that it mimics the book. My son  is thrilled that he can read the Dr. Seuss's ABCs book.",945820800,22,724,4.318518518518519
724938,5,6303911579,"I watched this video with my friends 2 year old daughter. She was singing the songs, jumping up and down and having fun; at the end she sang almost the whole alphabet. My friend commented that this was the first time she  sang almost the whole alphabet, and she always rents this video because her  daughter has learned so fast from it. I believe children are our future.  Buying this video is my investment in the future.",917136000,2,422,4.454545454545454
725138,5,6303911579,"We bought this video when our oldest daughter was 2 1/2. We had been trying to teach her, but she is very stubborn about learning things when she knows someone is trying to teach her.  After casually watching the video while playing, she knew her alphabet 3 days later!  Our youngest daughter started trying to sing the alphabet in the car with her sister at 22mo., but was having problems understanding the letters, and keeping groups of letters in order.  So we broke out the video again, and after just watching 1 time, she learned the alphabet completely and in order, and has done it perfectly ever since.  No matter what your child's learning style is, this video does amazing things!  Even my husband and I found it entertaining!",1025740800,2,736,4.674418604651163
725139,5,6303911579,"My 3 year old and I love this video. My sister purchased it about four years ago for my nephew. She passed it down to me once my nephew no longer needed it and believe me when I say I have become eternally grateful. You will find this video very cute as you watch Baby Bear dodge the ""Nosey Posey"" Goldilocks to say the Alphabet without her assistance. I found it hilarious that Baby Bear could not say the whole alphabet but used the word REGRESSED correctly in a sentence. (This video helped to make Baby Bear one of my favorite Sesame Street characters)
This video is great. Not only does it teach the Alphabet, but I also found that the songs that are sung for certain letters are the letters that my three-year old had a hard time remembering...UNTIL THIS VIDEO!!! Songs range from, ""Alphabet Jungle"", ""Let's Sing a Song about J"", and ""The D Song"". My son sings along to all the songs, he even gets up to do the Alphabet Exercises!!
I would recommend this video to any and every parent of a young child. Not only is it educational and fun, but it will also give us parents 40 minutes of peace!!!
* I also recommend Richard Scary's Best Learning Video Ever, and Sesame Street: Learning About Numbers*",1014249600,4,1204,4.427927927927928
725140,4,6303911579,"My daughter, the Sesame Street fanatic, has begun singing her abc's because of this video.  She's 21 months old.  Big Bird and Baby Bear work on learning the abc's. Baby Bear wants to learn them because Goldilocks gets on his nerves, butting-in and finishing them for him when he gets stuck.  When Goldilocks pops in, it's pretty funny.  Not a good video if your child only craves Elmo though.  He does NOT appear in this video.  For everyone else, this is a cute way to learn the abc's and have fun with them at the same time.",1013990400,4,527,4.381443298969073
725141,5,6303911579,"My 22-month son absolutely loves this video.  He watches the entire video without getting bored.  Sometimes he laughs and claps his hands.  Thank you, Sesame Street!!!",1013385600,,167,5.346153846153846
725142,5,6303911579,"This video is a great, fun way for kids to start learning the alphabet. It's filled with good and catchy songs, entertaining cartoons about the different letters, good ""live"" segments (as in using real people instead of being a cartoon), and a great story to tie it all together.
My 16-month old daughter is already starting to sing along with the first song (ABC-DEF-GHI), dances along with the ""T-dance"" skit, and beats her hands in time with the jazzy ""Alphabet Blues"". She still isn't really able to talk (not having a decent set of teeth yet makes it hard to say certain letters), but I have a feeling that once she does she'll be saying the whole alphabet in short order.",1012867200,3,677,4.603305785123967
725143,4,6303911579,"My 17-month-old loves this video. She sings with the songs (as well as she can!) and dances and requests it (""Bird! Bear! ABCs!"") constantly. Other reviewers are probably right that it's not the thing to get if you have an older child who needs to actually learn all the letters (the show is great for that) but for smaller toddlers this is a great start. She particularly loves the piggies at the barn dance.",1010448000,2,409,4.54054054054054
725144,1,6303911579,"My kids, ages 1 and 2, are Sesame Street video junkies, but they won't sit still for more than 2 minutes of this awful video.  The opening sequence where they set up the ""plot"" (such as it is) is way too long and features the lamest character in the lot -- Baby Bear.  The skits and songs themselves aren't bad, so my husband and I are thinking of taping them to another tape and editing out all the garbage in between.  We don't have any other alphabet videos so I can't recommend an alternative, but if you're just looking for a good Sesame Street video, my little ones love the 25th Anniversary Celebration, 1 2 3 Count With Me, and Elmo's Sing-Along Guessing Game.",1008460800,3,668,4.370967741935484
725145,5,6303911579,"This video is the best!  For my 2 year old son, this video surpasses Blues Clues, Bear in the Big Blue House, anything around.  My son has a speech delay, but after watching this video every day for 3 days, he was soon saying his ABC's and requesting ""Big Bird"" every time I asked him what he wanted to watch.  I would recommend this for every toddler.  Stick with the classics - this one and 123 Count with me beat them all hands down for pure entertainment and educational value.",999388800,,481,4.311111111111111
725146,4,6303911579,"Besides Baby Bears talk, I think my 15 month old enjoys the video very much.  I don't really think that Baby Bear's speech would have any affect on another child's speech.  I think its very educational and easy to learn from.  My daughter seems to get upset when Baby Bear tries to remember the alphabet and forgets; it's like she is trying to help him out.  Overall I think it's a great video.",975110400,6,394,4.3561643835616435
725147,5,6303911579,"I'm here to buy my second ""Do the Alphabet"" video.  I've had the first one for approximately 5 years and it went through my first three children watching it over and over and over again!  I had my fourth child in June and started playing it for her around 2 or 3 months...  to my surprise she actually watched the entire movie!  I play it for her so much that it is starting to drag and wear out...  so I'm buying her a brand new one!  She's 5.5 months now and rocks back and forth and tries to sing along with it!",974592000,8,514,3.9901960784313726

7854847,5,6303911579,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable, and make the process of learning the alphabet fun, not just a task for kids.

Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his ""lisp"" should not have been the focus, are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show, I guess they should not be on the show either????

So, I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters.",1109808000,6,882,4.33939393939394
7854848,5,6303911579,"We purchased this video about 6 months ago for my daughter who just turned 2.  We do have another letters video from Baby Bumble Bee, but the Sesame Street one is her favorite.  She has learned every letter from these videos and can tell us each letter by looking at it.  I think this is quite remarkable for just turning 2.  It is a very active, fun video and has truly helped her to enjoy the alphabet.  Highly recommend!",1074643200,,423,4.30379746835443
7854849,3,6303911579,"Our son has been singing the alphabets since he was 18 months, but we wanted him to become familiar with associating the names of the letters with what they look like.  I loved Sesame Street as a child, so we hoped this video would be a good introduction.  For his short attention span this movie does a good job at keeping him interested.  We like the short skits about some of the letters--they're pretty creative and catchy.  However, we were really annoyed that baby bear couldn't say his ""R""s.  Especially when our son, who is 3 1/2 with excellent vocabulary and word pronunciation, started saying words without the Rs after seeing the video for the first time.  After some explaining he started saying his Rs again, but he still 'slips' into baby bear talk now and again.  I'm disappointed that a movie that is supposed to be focussing on the alphabet can't even teach the correct pronunciation of a letter that so many children have a difficult time pronouncing anyway.  I feel it's poor planning that the main character is not able to say his Rs--repeatedly and annoyingly.  Although I give it an A for having creative ways of teaching/introducing letters and being able to keep a 3-year-old's attention, I give it a D for teaching incorrect letter pronunciation and the failure to accurately present what the movie is all about.",1073952000,8,1337,4.753246753246753
7854850,5,6303911579,"My 2 1/2 yr old son loves this video!  I kid you not, he is learning the alphabet.  He may skip over a few but atleast he is trying!  He hops, skips, and dances around the room and imitates all the kids on the screen.  When the letter J is introduced, my husband and I sit back and are entertained by his enthusiasum.  Then, when Billy Joel sings the ABC song with the neighborhood kids, my son gets in his serious mode to try and replicate it exactly. A quality video!",1069372800,2,469,4.1098901098901095
7854851,4,6303911579,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet, while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.
This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like ""J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans,"" and, my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing ""D.""  An incredibly funny clip.
So, this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!",1031702400,3,683,4.581967213114754
