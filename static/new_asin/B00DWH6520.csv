5861984,4,B00DWH6520,"I love the series...hate the price.  I just put the individual seasons in my cart and discovered I could get the entire series for $40 cheaper. This has no bonus content so why the price hike? So double check before you buy, in case the prices change.  Enjoy a great series!",1447200000,16,274,4.352941176470588

8598763,3,B00DWH6520,"I was so disappointed to find the second season was not even Law & Order, it was some kind of Oriental movie!!  Everyone has had a good laugh, because I thought I was getting a deal.  I did not bother to return them, because I had no faith that it would be corrected without a hassle!!! Definitely, not a good deal.",1526860800,,315,4.147540983606557

8598767,3,B00DWH6520,"Not a set nicely packaged in a display box, as one reviewer described it. Instead a collection of dvd's representing each season of the show. I was disappointed. I love this show, but was unhappy with this group of dvd's not in a display box but crammed with a lot of packing materials into a recycled cardboard box. Not what I expected.",1513900800,3,337,4.451612903225806
8598768,5,B00DWH6520,"Haven't opened these yet but I love the show.  Each season is separate, unlike the original Law and Order I received in a boxed set.  I've not opened any one CD box yet as I also ordered the regular L & O series so I have a long way to go watching.  They appear to be new in original wrapped cases.  All seems to be in order and shipping was quick.  I love this show!",1508803200,,367,3.84

8598771,5,B00DWH6520,"L&O Criminal Intent is one of those shows that you can really get into and follow the stars as they do their acting thing.  They seem to really BE those characters - a sign of good acting skills, I guess.  The stories are interesting and challenging to figure out what is actually happening since the story starts out from the criminal's point of view.  Generally speaking, what you first see is not what actually happened so it's always a surprise to see what and how things develop.  Vincent D'Onfrio really does seem like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes.  He really made the show.  But, adding Jeff Goldblum, who already has ties to a psychological source (his Dad) as another investigator, added another layer of interesting characters to the show.  Chris Noth was good, too, and I missed his character when he decided to leave Law and Order (the original one).  Great stories, surprising developments, more insight into the minds of criminals without being too deep with the psycho stuff, and great acting by all makes this a wonderfully entertaining set of videos to enjoy.  Just wish the series could have gone on even longer - it was that enjoyable to watch.",1494115200,7,1163,4.775
