2442450,3,B000BVM1SC,"First off, Rachel McAdams is a real stunner.

Had to get that out of the way.  I'm sorry, but it had to be said.

Moving on.....

Director Wes Craven has taken a rather pedestrian script with stock supporting characters and little originality and elevated it to a reasonably tense thriller.  Well, it was reasonably tense for a little while, at least.  The scenes on the plane work rather well.

Beyond that, however, it is largely formulaic and forgettable.

Actress Suzie Plakson is in this film as a flight attendant.  Plakson is a wonderfully talented comic actress and theatre veteran.  She deserves better material than this.

The two leads in the film play well off each other, but once the film changes into a series of chases and cat-and-mouse sequences in the third act it feels like something we've seen a hundred times before.

**MILD SPOILER -- but relax, it's not too much**

As Cillian Murphy's character exits plane to chase after McAdams' character at the Miami airport, he grabs a scarf off a female passenger to wrap around his throat wound.  He wears it like that for the rest of the film.  But when he ends up chasing/stalking McAdams' in her father's house, he looks in several shots like Paul Lynde in a neckerchief.

Ooh, now that's scary.

One of the few moments in the film that seemed original to me was a brief bit of business on a fishing boat.  How does one hide weaponry on a boat from a Coast Guard inspection?  Find out in this film.

And the Security team that ordered the search referred to the inspection team as the Coast Guard, but their vests read ""Shore Patrol"".  Limited costume budget, perhaps?

And having that neckerchief cover up the throat wound all the time sure saved time and money on special effects make-up too.  Not decisively proof of a budget decision, but it was the first thing I thougt of.

Worth seeing?  Maybe once.

Worth buying on DVD eventually?  Hard to say.  The film runs less than 90 minutes so it at least is spared of any fat.  The ""fat"" is what tends to drag down suspense movies on repeat viewings, so ""Red Eye"" has the advantage of avoiding that problem.

The premise for this film was interesting but not inspired.  In the hands of a lesser director it would probably have been completely forgettable altogether.  At least Craven instills it with a degree of filmmaking cred.",1124496000,4,2347,4.635036496350365
2442451,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" is a tight, efficient little thriller that has a simple goal and achieves it well. That goal is, of course, to play up the horrors of flying coach.

Not really, of course, but it might as well be; I have always thought the cramped quarters and general wretchedness of flying ""steerage class"" remain largely unexploited by film. Wes Craven, a filmmaker whose other work I have managed to avoid, proves himself capable of delivering thrills and a few very good scares in ""Red Eye"", without ever going quite over the top. (One scene involving a pen comes close, but we are spared anything graphic.)

The plot is simple: Lisa Reisert, a workaholic hotel manager, is trying to catch the red-eye flight back to her job in Miami. Hanging out in the airport after her flight is cancelled, she Meets Cute with Jackson Rippner, an attractive young man who seems to know a lot about her and has an extremely effective way with people. They talk, they drink, they flirt. She is surprised to see that she's seated next to him when they do finally get a flight. He is kind and understanding of her fear of flying, and distracts her during takeoff by talking about her family. He seems the perfect person to sit beside on a late-night, long-delayed flight.

As all who fly at all frequently know, this is not how flights, especially in coach, go. And so it is here. After the initial takeoff turbulence subsides, Jackson unleashes a little of his own when he reveals he has a bit of a mission for Lisa: using her official capacities as hotel manager, she must switch rooms on high-profile government official Keefe - Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, no less! - to make an assassination easier for Jackson's employers. If she refuses, Jackson tells her, a man with a long knife will make sure that Lisa's homebody father will have to be ""buried in a closed casket.""

Things progress fairly rapidly from that point, and the usual elements are all in place: aborted alert messages, chase scenes, telephone glitches, a couple of very nifty explosions, and yes, even the cat-and-mouse chase through the house, complete with the Man with a Knife and the Shower Curtain Surprise. These are all effective in delivering scares and suspense, particularly as the movie is for the majority of its running time an airborne kidnapping movie and there's nowhere for the characters to go. This sense of claustrophobia is one of the film's strongest elements and works well to support (and sometimes camouflage) the somewhat flimsy premise.

Really, though, it is the performances that make this movie worth seeing. Rachel McAdams is capable as Lisa, a workaholic with no personal life and that meddlesome sort of wide-eyed cheerfulness that service-industry workers always seem to have. However, ""Red Eye"" really belongs to Cillian Murphy, the remarkable young Irish actor who also delivered thrills and chills as the Scarecrow in this summer's ""Batman Begins."" Here he exudes a particular sort of scary sexiness that is quite engaging onscreen: his villain is the kind one finds oneself inadvertently cheering for, just because he's cool and confident. With his icy blue eyes and strong features, he is interesting to watch, and he is capable of radiating boyish charm at one moment and cold pragmatism the next, without ever losing credibility. And Brian Cox, who seems to be in everything, gives a nice turn as Lisa's worry-addicted father.

The intricacies of the plot start to fall apart upon closer inspection, such as how quickly Keefe's security squad agrees to the sudden change of plans, or why Jackson has seemingly planned everything out to the last detail except for the part about having a back-up plan. And there were tantalizing hints that never developed, such as an unsatisfactorily explained scar and Jackson's accusation that Lisa is neither very honest nor very nice. But at 85 minutes, the movie's pacing is fast and tight, and there is little down-time to think about such things while one's watching it. It is a competent if not outstanding thriller, and is short enough to entertain without dragging. The ending is a little tidy, but given the subject matter (government defense officials threatened with assassination, violent acts on an airplane) what else could one expect in this day and age?",1124496000,3,4324,4.916438356164384
2442452,4,B000BVM1SC,"Fasten your seatbelts, sit back and remember most flights end well... but you've got some turbulence to get through first. Wonderful staging, directing and acting made Craven's flight a non-stop thrill ride. He has you sitting in glorious tension as several calm and seemingly sweet scenes go on between Cillian and Rachel. But we know theres more... and Craven flips the switch at just the right moment with chilling dialogue and ensuing action.
Rachel McAdams surprised me with her realistic sobbing reaction and continued to keep me(ok, I AM a girl) near tears throughout many scenes. Cillian Murphey is the perfect villian(proven with his role as the ONLY good thing in Batman) gorgeous and sinister as he plays his role with icy yet edgy preciseness. I'm glad that he saw through all of her plans - it made it more realistic.
When she first started kicking butt, I was a little bit worried we'd get Tomb Raider feministic fop action, but she maintained her shaky terror fairly well. Also, the fact that she'd been attacked before gave her reason to be prepared and have the ability to execute some clear thinking and action amidst such trauma(her previous attack also explains her jittery relations with Cillian in the airport before she knows who he is).
The two things I might have altered: 1) That Cillian didn't get a little more depth of character. There were a couple moments where you saw him swallow hard or look at Rachel a tidge differently, but mostly he was pure evil. A little bit of subtle struggling with his mission would have given the film a little more edge and Cillian could have more than handled it. 2) The cop-out ""hollywood ending"" scene. Urgh. They kept it so real up to the last scene where McAdams DID succumb to putting on the tough girl pants and going back to work MINUTES AFTER HER LIFE HAD BEEN BRUTALLY THREATENED to deliver some sassy lines to cranky customers.
But I can forgive for a movie that delivered very solid acting, very creative filming, very intense action, and very edge-of-your-seat-grab-your-boyfriend-scream-in-the-theatre scares.
Red Eye is worth seeing, and is probably even worth seeing in theatres if you get the chance.",1124409600,3,2179,4.876010781671159
2442453,4,B000BVM1SC,"Who knew watching two people on a plan for 20 minutes could be this gripping? Red Eye has delivered us not only the best Thriller of the summer, but also one of the best films of the summer. Rachel McAdams, who is most known for Mean Girls and The Notebook, proves to us that she's one of the rare actresses with not only beauty, but the smarts and raw untained talent to back it up. Julia Roberts better watch her back, because this girl is coming and will rip that Hollywood crown straight from her head. The other amazing actor Cillian Murphy is both crudely evil and disturbingly sexy as the villian Jack Rippner. This is a class A seat clencher that will have you sweating with suspense until the films end. The story of the film isn't anything new, but the way the film is executed is unique and satisfying. I must again say that the reason this film works so well is because of the wonderfully tense performances by the two leads, Rachel and Cillian. They are fine actors who should have long lasting careers. Wes Craven has once again proven why he's the leading man in creating worlds of horror and panic, this movie is excellent.",1124409600,3,1139,4.454545454545454
2442454,5,B000BVM1SC,"this movie was awesome. wes craven starts off with a suspensefull opening scene and it never lets down.

rachel mcadams plays a young woman who is forced by cillian murphy to assist him in killing the united state's secretary of homeland security or he will have someone kill her father. from there on, the movie keeps adding suspense and goes out with a bang.

this is craven's best work in a long time, and he goes back to the scenes that made scream a great movie itself. cillian murphy gives a great performance and rachel mcadams (god shes beautiful) gives another great performance.",1124409600,4,588,4.699029126213592
2442455,3,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven's 2nd movie this year...the other one was the failed werewolf flop Cursed which came out in late February. Red Eye is much better then Cursed and is a Craven diversion from his usual gore scare fest. Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, Mean Girls) plays Lisa who is taking the Red Eye back home because she just had her Grandma's funeral. She is going back to where she works which is a Hotel in Miami and also to her Father, played by the great Brian Cox (X2: X-Men United, Troy). In the airport she meets Jack Riptner, played with sinister ease by the awesome Cillian Murphy (Intermission, 28 Days Later). McAdams and Murphy hit it off sharing things with one another and having drinks. She then winds up ironically sitting right next to him on the plane. But it's not a coincedence because he is there for a purpose and that purpose is for McAdams to do somethings for him otherwise her Father dies. Murphy wants McAdams to have her Hotel switch rooms for a rich man and his family because he is going to be killed. So, McAdams tries everything to stall him and escape but he sees right threw her. Eventually, when the plane lands she escapes and he follows her to try to stop her. The two leads give good performances, especially Murphy who is playing yet another bad guy this summer alongside the hit Batman Begins where he played The Scarecrow. The end showdown scene in the house kinda felt a little bit Scream-ish. Also starring Colby Donaldson...and if you don't know who is he, he played one of the rich guy's secret service suits and he was also in the second season of Survivor...dont ask me how I know this...I just do.",1124409600,4,1641,4.5286195286195285
2442456,5,B000BVM1SC,"While I prefer John Carpenter in terms of horror directors, Wes Craven deserves credit for A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream (1st one only), and now this little gem. The two performances that the movie focuses on almost the entire time is that of Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy. Rachel McAdams is a cutie with a gorgeous smile, but she also shows a wide range of emotions here (she goes from just a regular nice girl to a kick butt action star by the closing of the film). Cillian Murphy is really perfect here. As in Batman Begins, he hits all the creepy notes dead on and is probably one of the most believable villians to come on screen in a while. Without these two in the roles that seem written just for them, the movie would likely have been less effective in more ways than one. Red Eye runs a little under 90 minutes and never lets you catch your breath once the plane is off the ground.

4.5 out of 5 stars",1124409600,3,919,4.281609195402299
2442457,3,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye is Wes Craven's attempt at making a suspense movie and he pulls it off fine. This isn't the first time he proved he can make more than just horror movies though. He also made a drama with Merryl Streep about 4 or 5 years back. Anyway it's called Red Eye because that's the name of the plane Rachel McAdams takes. Some trailers make the movie look supernatural. With Cillian Murphy eyes turning red like he's a demon or something that's taunting McAdams. No though this is just a thriller and he's just a normal guy. Well if you call a hitman a normal guy.

  Anyway McAdams meets Murphy when the flight is delayed. She seems to like his company andc this could've became one of those romantic movies about a chance meeting. Since they have good chmestry. After getting on the plane she finds that she's seated next him as well. Soon after take off he reveils that he's going to have someone kill her dad if she doesn't do what he says. Since she has authority at an airline, she can move his targets room which would make him an easier to target.

  Cillian Murphy (Batman Beging, 28 Days Later) and Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers) give fine performances. He shows how evil and manipulative he is and she shows it's not gonna be as easy as he thought. She turns out to be both tough and smart. Unlike Murphy she'll go on to more romantic comedies and dramas and he'll probably be stuck type casted a villian. He is great as one though and probably even better here than he was in Batman Begins as the Scare Crow.

  Brian Cox (X-2, 25th Hour) is a really good actor but here he's weak as her father. His performance is like something you'd get from a straight to video movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually Brian Cox. Guess it's not really his fault. He wasn't really given a part worthy of him. Here he just answers the phone through most the movie and gets disconnected before she can warn him that he's in trouble. McAdams and Murphy give the best performances by far. They both are likeable. Murphy charms you and her in the beginning of the movie. Then he makes you afraid of him.  This isn't a bad movie for Craven either. Certainly better for his resume than Cursed.",1124409600,3,2230,4.417073170731707
2442458,4,B000BVM1SC,"No knife-wielding gloves or masked/robed killers; RED EYE is a suspense film.  Horror is his niche, and horror has gotten him a long way.  Horror has also been done (pardon the pun) to death!  RED EYE is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller, that manages to free itself from predictability, and put a nice new spin on the genre.  After reflecting back to the movie, you realize just how different the characters and situations are from most thrillers.  The audience jumped in all the right places, cheered a couple times, and applauded at the end.  How often does THAT happen in movies these days?",1124409600,5,601,4.622641509433962

The movie itself is about a woman named Lisa (Rachel McAdams, from The Hot Chick and The Notebook) who is the manager of a hotel called The Lux Atlantic. She meets a real charmer (Cilian Murphy, from 28 Days Later and Batman Begins) at the airport on her way back from her grandmother's funeral, and at first there seems to be a nice spark between them. Some cutesy banter is exchanged, and he ends up sitting next to her on the plane back to her home.

While on the plane, he reveals his intention to assassinate a high-profile guest at her hotel, and he requires her help in doing so. She tries to refuse, as her family is apparently close with this person. She is black mailed, and she has her hands tied. However, she fights back, and the rest of the movie is a nice action-thriller.

I like girl-power movies, and I like action flicks with substance. This has both. These actors are really good at what they do, and it actually gave me new respect for McAdams after The Hot Chick. I thought I wouldn't be able to take her seriously, but she does an amazing job at being in the character zone with every movie she appears in. Murphy is the same way; he's an excellent villain.

Forget his Batman roles--this is a serious stage and film ACTOR. If you doubt it, see him in the BBC show ""Peaky Blinders"", or the films ""Peacock"", or ""Breakfast on Pluto"", or ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"", or ""The Edge of Love"".  He never plays the same role twice and brings a haunting  intensity to everything he does. His performances have been so real and emotional, so subtle and complex, that I have been moved to tears. I was moved by this all right, but not in a good way, since I was cringing the whole time!  I didn't even finish watching the film. Bad writing, cliched dialogue, bad plotting, pedestrian TV-movie-style cinematography. Cillian WAS the best thing in it and clearly was not taking any of it too seriously, and Rachel MacAdams acquitted herself well. But eh--skip this one, and watch one of the Cillian movies listed above. ALSO--I do NOT understand all these reviewers who think he's creepy-looking, or ugly, or weird-looking. I guess if you've only seen him in villainous roles, you would think that because he becomes the characters he plays. But you owe it to yourself to see him in more serious roles, like the ones listed above.

It wouldn't be nice for me to give away the plot line, so I'll try to get you to see it without revealing too much.
It is set in the Hitchcock style, the main star gets in deeper and deeper with no seeming way out. You are brought into Rachel McAdams world as she is trying to get home after a funeral. She meets Cillian Murphy who turns out to be the middle man for some very bad people.  Now for most of the movie they are trapped on an airplane.  Wes Craven, who is the master at scaring you, directs this little thriller.  Wow what an awesome job.  He pulls you into their lives and your heart is pounding to see how she will get out of the dilemma she finds herself in.
Brian Cox does an excellent job as her dad. The way they move when they are talking on the phone, for example, really lends to the ""reality"" of the relationship.
It has just enough action to keep your attention but the story is where this movie finds its strength.

2442527,3,B000BVM1SC,"Famed horror director, Wes Craven (RIP), takes a stab at the thriller genre with moderate success.  Busy, luxury hotel manager (McAdams) meets personable young man (Murphy) when her flight is delayed.  Soon, however, she is informed theirs is no chance encounter.  The leads are fine but the ridiculously short running time hints at studio interference and/or production problems and plot points are underdeveloped; reference to an earlier attack on McAdams becomes a pointless aside.  Like the recent Cellular the film is also hindered by its viewer friendly MPAA rating.....it's simply not tough enough.  That said, it is fast-paced and entertaining, but you wonder if a longer, superior, movie was originally intended.  Cox, as the father, is wasted.

2442566,5,B000BVM1SC,"This movie does not really explore the invasion of privacy issue and how that will simply destroy the target if it gets publicized and becomes public property.  SHE will become public property and it's going to take a lot of soft blankets and sound proof views of the green rolling meadows to balance her out.

This is an awesome movie and Rachel McAdams is super likable in it.  She is really good at enduring injury while providing good if not excellent customer service to the killer in the next seat played by Cillian Murphy who uses his hooded blue eyes to great effect here.  Those eyes should get their own paycheck for this movie.

So this is a performance of good manners vs unbelievable rudeness on the part of Cillian Murphy's character -throughout he is disrespectful while chatting her up and she never lets on but his rudeness and self confidence is created from the fact that he has invaded her privacy.  And so tenuous is his confidence and sense of self and so required is that unauthorized surveillance to bolster him, that he very nearly stabs her when she doesn't behave according to plan - probably because she senses something unnatural and unfairly disadvantaged about the scene at the bar hence her ""going off script.""

So much is pointed out but not explicitly described in this film.  Its yummy.

The wikipedia entry for Sea Breeze even CITES the Red Eye scene.  That's how ridiculous and in character, Cillian Murphy's a-hole is about HONESTY.

He's been INVADING HER PRIVACY and he's OUTRAGED that Rachel MacAdams' character did not behave as predicted after ""watching [her] for EIGHT months.""

Cillian Murphy plays a suave terrorist who intends to use McAdams's character's position in a hotel to carry out a plot to assinate the United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (theere's a mouthful.)  McAdams's character is motivated to cooperate by the fact that her father, who remains unaware of the plot, will become very aware of what's going on, right before he's killed.  That's a nice twist...usually the father is ""motivated"" by his daughter's possible fate.  Murphy's character is truely terrifying, a testiment to the man's acting ability, and we are reminded of how terrifying when he so creepily reminds McAdams (and us) of how brutally honest he has been from the beginning.

2442605,3,B000BVM1SC,"Okay, first the things about RED EYE that bugged me, as they kept getting in the way of my overall enjoyment of the movie.  A flight from Dallas to Miami would take about 3 hours--not all night.  I fly, a lot, and believe me, a conversation such as the two main characters were having in their seats would be easily heard by other passengers.  And the periodic violence in the seats would most certainly be noticed.  I realize I'm nitpicking, because overall, RED EYE is a nice thriller with a predictable, over-the-top ending.

The sizzling Rachel McAdams plays Lisa, the manager of a luxury hotel in Miami. Lisa is flying back to Miami from Dallas following her grandmother's funeral.  While at the gate she crosses paths with a man with the interesting name Jackson Rippner (the always-creepy Cillian Murphy); Jackson buys Lisa a drink, they board their flight, and to Lisa's delight they're seated next to one another.  But. . .once they are airborne, Jackson quietly tells Lisa the truth:  there is a hit man across the street from her father's home, and unless Lisa contacts her hotel to relocate the Director of Homeland Security to another suite (making the target more accessible to some waiting assassins), the hit man will kill her father (a bewildered looking Brian Cox).  Naturally Lisa feebly attempts to resist, then get the word out to other passengers she is in danger, but Jackson thwarts her at every turn.  So the room is changed, the plane lands, and a breathless ending ensues, as Lisa tries simultaneously to save her father and the Director.

Again, this Wes Craven thriller is taut and tight, and at 85 minutes it's the perfect length.  McAdams turns in an enjoyable performance as her overwhelmed character finds a way to come through at the end.  The ending is absolutely lame; the Murphy character becomes some sort of human punching bag.  (Not to mention a little throat wound that will guarantee a wince.)  Predictable and uneven, RED EYE is still sufficient entertainment for those who like their heart rate to spike while watching a movie.

She meets a guy (played by Cillian Murphy) who seems all right at first but turns out to be a lot more than she bargained for and as you can imagine things go bad.

I'm used to seeing McAdams in other genres but she does a good enough job here as the female heroine. There are some interesting and memorable sub characters in this film.
In fact, one could argue the characters are much more interesting than the actual plot.

Cillian Murphy, who I remember mostly as ""Scarecrow"" in ""Batman Begins"", plays his usual nice mix of Mr. Nice Guy and ""he seems creepy or off but you can't quite figure out why"".

The film stars Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) as a manager of a very nice hotel and Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later & Batman Begins) as the man who gets on the plane with her.
If you need any more help, he's the man with his hand holding hers in this picture.
And if you need to promote the film by using the quote, ""killer of a thriller"" you must know this is going to be a bad-bad film.
Would you do whatever the bad guy tells you if you're flying at 35,000 feet and your dad's life is at stake?
That's the plot of the movie. Add in the assassination attempt of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security and you get the horrible Red Eye.
The casting was awful. I enjoyed these two in their earlier films, The Notebook and Batman Begins but in Craven's world, these two do not act well.

Especially Murphy. His character is downright goofy. And that's not a good thing when you're trying to be a cold-hearted killer.

2442629,5,B000BVM1SC,"A movie about a cold-blooded terrorist named ""Jack Rippner"" played by an actor named Cillian (pronounced KILL-ian). How perfect is that?

This is a movie about a victim who fights back. Like her attacker two years earlier, her assailant holds a knife to her throat only this time it's a metaphorical weapon that keeps her in check. And no matter what she does she will remain scarred for life. Or will she? Her previous attack occurred in a setting where presumably there were people around who should have been able to help her but didn't. Nor do they here.

First the bad.

The plot is thin and Craven is not Hitchcock.

The assassination plot is too complicated; the writers should have watched Scarface and learned how a nuisance and his family can be taken out with far less effort.

McAdams is terrorized and abused for 3 solid hours and the only person on the plane who seems to notice that anything is wrong is an 11-year-old child.

I usually enjoy Wes Craven's movies, but his film-making style has a tendency to patronize the viewer. In the pursuit of thrills, he seems to only ask ""would the audience like it?"" and not ""would the audience buy it?"" The lithe and delicate-looking McAdams possesses Rambo-like strength and fighting ability, impaling her adversary's body with blunt objects and firing a vase at him with the force of a meteorite. Are Bob and Marianne Taylor ---holes? Yes. Would any respectable employee tell them to ""shove it""? No. I don't know why it was necessary for Cynthia to take the elevator all the way to the top floor to warn the Keefes; wouldn't a phone call from the Front Desk have saved time and been safer for Cynthia? Why does Keefe trust Reisert with his life and how does Reisert know what kind of a person he is?

Clich elements and dialogue. At times the acting and screenplay appear mechanical and scripted. This does not happen with the two main characters, however.

Now the good.

The casting of the two leads and their acting. Both Murphy and McAdams are brilliant in their roles. Whatever problems the plot may suffer from on the ground don't really matter because this movie is about what goes on between two people in the air.

Can you kidnap someone on an airplane? Ten years ago some people might have thought it ridiculous to make a movie about a group of terrorists who hijack a couple of airplanes and fly them into high-rise buildings, but they wouldn't think it ridiculous today. In any case, this movie was not about kidnapping in the usual sense. It was about threat and coercion which can happen just about anywhere. Rippner didn't get on board with a box cutter, only a stolen wallet and for the purpose of persuading the heroin to make a phone call. He was holding her hostage psychologically; he told her if she told the flight attendant her father would die. So she was forced to spend the flight trying to deliver messages surreptitiously and it never worked. Truth is stranger than fiction and there are situations that make headlines around the world every day that you couldn't make up. ""Man coerces woman in plane in murder plot; woman escapes""? I don't have a problem with it. Plausible or not, this is a very effective thriller. Not a second of screen-time is wasted and the suspense never lets up.

For her role as victim, McAdams completely sells it. And Murphy seems to understand well the mind of the sociopath. Anyone who has ever known one knows not only how they are able to rationalize their evil deeds but the strange way they seem to interpret situations and events, always through the lens of their own inflated ego and self-serving agenda. Jackson quotes Dr. Phil to Lisa as she regains consciousness, lectures her about honesty and the importance of getting the job done to keep customers happy. The senseless makes sense in his dark mind.

Unintended comedy in a movie is often a bad thing, but you've got to love it here. A flashy, high-profile terrorist winds up chasing a woman around her house with a lady's scarf wrapped around his neck and angrily pulling the heel of a woman's shoe out of his leg. McAdams' character mocks and emasculates him in the process which only serves to fuel his rage. Movies in which abused women fight back have been popular since the 80s. But not since Farah Fawcett shoved a can of bug spray into the face of a would-be rapist in Extremities have I found it so satisfying to see a scoundrel get what's coming to him.

One gets the feeling that Rippner's frustration and rage is as much about wanting Lisa and not being able to have her as it is about the possibility of his life going to s---. No wonder Cillian Murphy fans are checking the internet daily to find out of Red Eye 2 is in the works yet. There is even a petition for it somewhere on the internet. The villain isn't the only one dealing with inner conflict. In my opinion, men who abuse women are cowards. So what is it about Rippner that makes him so appealing? It can't just be his good looks. If any prequel or sequel is ever made, I will be the first one in line outside the theater the day it opens. But Jackson-and-Lisa fanfiction readers who envision them running off into the sunset together should realize that this villain is a VERY bad man and the script writers have big hurdles to get over if these two are ever to appear on screen together again. Want to know what Rippner does for a living? He already told you. Want to know how his parents died? He already told you that, too. And, remember, Jackson Rippner ""never lies.""",1275264000,6,5526,4.569696969696969
2442630,1,B000BVM1SC,"Don't blame an excellent cast for this story told by idiots.
Rachel McAdams, as the heroine and Cillian Murphy, as the creepy, oily villian, are both standouts.
It's the crazy script and direction by horror master Wes Craven that turn this cat-and-mouse thriller into hysteria.

I've always been a fervid Craven fan and his Nightmare on Elm Street movies are among my favorites.

But something went wrong here. Although the idea is original, it quickly deteriorates into a gooey mess.

McAdams is trapped on a plane by the creepy monster who sits next to her--played deliciously evil  Murphy. She has to obey his every wish or else her father will be killed. This is where the plot falls apart.  Even after Murphy head-butts her and knocks her out, she never fights back.

One would think that she could scream: ""Man with a bomb!"" After all, the plane is packed with plane staff workers and many others. Only after the plane lands does she finally injure her captor but then she acts even more illogically. Instead of trying to get help, she races from the plane and through the terminal without ever calling 911 or asking any of the many security guards for help.

Her enemy follows her home. Never does she run screaming into the streets. She runs all over the house, passing by open doors to the outside. When the killer is hot on her trail, she runs through the den--but instead of heading outside, she runs up the stairs to the second floor! If she had just stopped one secrurity officer at the airport, she could have avoided all this danger.

If she could have just called 911, she would have saved herself, her father and the homeland security officer who is the object of the terrorist wrath.

But, of course, if McAdams had done any of these logical actions that most of us would have done, there would be no movie and I wouldn't be muttering here about the idiot actions of characters who wuuld never make it for one second in the real world.",1274572800,3,1953,4.589080459770115

2442635,4,B000BVM1SC,"Horror specialist Wes Craven's Red Eye (2005) is a thriller that despite some logical snags, and an unlikely conclusion, is still effective and exciting.  Brushing the flaws aside is not too difficult, when Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls) delivers a marvelous credible performance that evolves from engaging to riveting.  McAdams plays Lisa Reisert, a traveler returning from Dallas, back to Miami.  Because she works in reservations and hospitality at a luxury hotel, Lisa becomes the key player in an elaborate plot to murder a VIP guest.  A random meeting at the airport with a charming stranger (Cillian Murphy), seems quite innocent, even when the quiet Jackson Rippner winds up in the seat next to Lisa on the red eye flight to Miami.  The two seem to be getting along wonderfully, but the light conversation comes to an abrupt end, when Rippner tells Lisa that her father will die, unless she makes a call and gets the targeted guest relocated to a specific room.

This rather weak premise is the lynchpin for everything that happens from here, and though quite tenuous, it still seems to fly.  Lisa's world becomes one of fear and anxiety as she tries to find a way out.  Most of the screentime is of the pair sitting side by side, engaged in a deadly drama, which somehow remains a private matter between the two.  At the opportune moment, Lisa acts decisively, but Jack is quite relentless, leading to an unexpected and violent confrontation.

The inspired performances by Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, help to smooth over some of the absurdities, and make the film worth watching.  The dialog is quite good for a film in this genre, and the action and fighting scenes at the finale are pretty slickly executed under Craven's direction.  Rated PG-13, Red Eye has few wasted moments.  There are some nice extras that include a couple of featurettes, and a commentary track with director Wes Craven, producer Marianne Maddalena, and editor Patrick Lussier.  The film also benefits from Marco Beltrami's effective musical score.",1253318400,3,2036,4.967551622418879

""Red Eye"" is a thriller!  It's creepy and may make you not want to fly on an airplane ever again.  At the very least, it may keep you from talking to a complete stranger in the airport or next to you on the plane.

""Red Eye"" follows the life of a young woman, Lisa, who is on the way home after her grandmother has died.  She works for a high end hotel and ends up getting called while she's gone.  While waiting in line to check in, people complain and since she's from a customer service background she tries to calm the crowd.  Being irrate isn't going to get them anywhere.  She ends up getting help from one other person in line and he asks her if she'll meet him for a drink before the flight.

Lisa ends up going to meet up with the guy even though she wasn't going to.  He tries to guess her drink order and almost gets it.  They end up boarding and sitting right next to each other.  Once the plane is in the air, he reveales to her that he needs her to do something or he's going to have people kill her father.  He wants her to arrange for a special high profile guest to be relocated to a different room, so that he'll be easier to kill.

Lisa resists for a while and with the storm blowing them about, the phones on the plane go in and out.

Eventually, Lisa ends up having them relocate the guest, but she isn't about to give up, especially when she realizes that the guest she relocated will be visiting this time with his family.  She doesn't want to see the wife and two children killed as well.  She tries to leave clues, but he finds them before anyone can see them every time.

When the plane touches down, Lisa takes action to get away.  She makes it all the way home and finds herself in an all new battle.  Saving her father isn't the only thing she has to do, she has to save her guest and his family at her hotel as well.",1250899200,2,1911,4.099730458221024

In this taut suspense-thriller, Murphy plays a charming stranger that our protagonist, Lisa, meets on a Red Eye flight to Miami. Their chemistry is immediate and she finds herself drawn to the attractive guy with the intense blue eyes. The first part of the movie misleads the viewer into letting down their guard and joining in their flirtation.

But their meeting was not happenstance instead it's part of a larger plot involving a political assassination that Murphy's character ""Jackson Rippner"" (yes, even Jackson is in on the joke) has orchestrated as a ""manager"" of government overthrows and high profile assassinations.

What follows in the second half is an intense mind game/power struggle between Lisa and her tormentor, all on-board an airplane. This claustrophobic scene plays particularly well and both actors should be commended on their performances. They are so real that the instances of violence really shock. (particularly the knock-out scene)

The last part of the movie amps up the action and pushes our characters into a showdown. While at this point it becomes less realistic, it does offer some fun action including an explosion thrown in for good measure.

While I fully expected Murphy's suave, arrogant character to get the beat-down that he so deserved, I did find the shift from the ultra-controlled, condesending assassin to the less than effective killer to be a bit ""off"" but I was the only one in my family that noted it so it just must be me.

2442658,5,B000BVM1SC,"I've always been a fan of Wes Craven's films. He brings a wonderfully dark sense of humor, a deep sense of literacy (the man was, I believe, an English professor before he started making horror flicks) and a great storytelling ability to whatever he does. While his track record is imperfect (Cursed is pretty wretched), his duds are few and fade out in the great white glare of classics like Last House on the Left and A Nightmare on Elm Street. He has the rare ability to create total environments in which to house his stories; even when the material is fantastic, as with the Elm Street films, Shocker or Serpent and the Rainbow, it's grounded in a psychological reality everybody can recognize. It's the human dimension of his movies that lift them apart from a lot of the shlock horror fare that's out there, in which two-dimensional characters exist solely to be ripped apart in gooey ways.

Which brings us to Red Eye, which is not a horror movie per se, although it contains horrific and timely elements (the fear of terrorism, with its randomness, informs and heightens the claustrophobia). Red Eye is a taut Hitchcockian thriller in which a young professional woman played by Rachel McAdams (The Wedding Crashers) takes a red eye flight back to her home in Miami after attending her grandmother's funeral. It develops that her seatmate (the Irish actor Cillian Murphy, playing an American hit man with hypnotic, creepy brio)is finessing an assassination plot on a high-ranking government official who's staying at the hotel McAdams manages. The entire second act of the film takes place in the plane, a daring contrivance that Craven brings off with great form. What makes this movie Hitchcockian is, of course, the close-quarter threat (Lifeboat, Rope, Rear Window) and the bomb in plain sight/ticking clock element, as McAdams races against time to prevent the assassination and foil Murphy's designs.

But what really stands out about the movie, and I think the reason I bought it after renting it a couple of years ago and forgetting much of the plot, is the incredibly strong female lead. McAdams is sexy, smart, self-reliant and ingenious, and much of the fun of the film is watching Murphy's cocksure assassin lose control of the reins, as McAdams not only fails to be intimidated by him but actually shows herself to be the craftier--because more imaginative, and flexible--of the two.

2442685,5,B000BVM1SC,"`Red Eye' was a real surprise for me.  It's one of those thrillers that keeps you tense until the very end and even manages to live up to the task again upon repeat viewings.  I think the short run time really helps this movie for it never lags long enough for you to forget why your frightened or lose interest in what your about to see.  The movie spends a few minutes in the beginning establishing our heroine Lisa, giving her a personality, a career and a dilemma.  We are also introduced to Jackson Rippner, a mysterious man who charms her, buys her a drink and then coincidentally lands himself next to her on the plane.  He's affectionate, compassionate and has the odd good looks of a man who knows he can woo any woman he desires.  This takes all but a few minutes, but their minutes well spent.

Soon after the plane is off the runway though, Jackson's charm fades away and his true intentions are made manifest.  He's here to persuade Lisa to make a phone call, a life altering phone call into the hotel where she works, having a very important man moved into a room that will ultimately cost him his life.  If she refuses to play along her dear old dad will be murdered.  Lisa seems to have no choice, but she's a strong willed woman, and a smart one at that, and so you know she finds a way out.  The section of the film taking place aboard the plane is nicely paced and edited well, adding layers of claustrophobia to the already tense atmosphere, and once they leave the airport and make their way to Lisa's home things get even more intense and Jackson becomes even more tyrannical.

The script is tight and enjoyable, intense and smart and the direction is great at the hands of Wes Craven considering that he's had a long line of flops recently.  It's the chemistry between the two leads though that really makes this movie as great as it is.  Rachel McAdams actually delivers a well thought out and mature performance here.  She's never out of her league, never out of her comfort zone.  She's completely authentic and a natural talent.  Cillian Murphy is even better.  He's proven that he can play the villainous character before but here he ups the ante and delivers a stone cold killer in every sense of the word.  Props to Carl Ellsworth for writing a superb script, and to everyone involved for making `Red Eye' one of the better suspense thrillers to hit the big screen in a long time.",1183680000,3,2410,4.44874715261959

2442687,2,B000BVM1SC,"It's summer, well almost, so instead of shelling out a few hard earned dollars for this atrocious film, get an ice cream cone and enjoy it, as you will tremendously more than this B-Movie thriller. I remember seeing Blockbuster littered with the Red Eye boxes when it first came out. I mean it was a pluthera all over the place, you couldn't escape the jaded hand image on the box, it would like follow your every look around the store. I should have rented it instead of purchasing it, a fool and his money should never have been brought together from jumpstreet.

Brian Cox is always a delight. I do follow his work, and he was superb in Running with Scissors and L.I.E., however he is very bland and boring in his role as Rachel's father. In fact in the scenes near the end when she plows her car through the front door area (go ahead and recall it), I almost for a minute, thought he was in on it. It seemed like his role in this was just a leasurily stroll through Central during an idle Sunday.

Wes Craven, I am sure, has some die hard followers, and even if the film sinks lower than that vile nastiness in between the rails at the 42nd street NR stop, they will hail his work as a Modern Marvel.

Clearly not the case with Red Eye. It is suppoosed to be a thriller and I would assume sort of scary, edge of your seat kind of stuff. No? Believe me, its not scary, its not suspensful, and they do not make it believable in the least. I watched it with my mother, who I bring over a flick for once in awhile, and although she was losing interest after the first 40 minutes or so, I really tried to get into it. Sadly I could not. It was ""NOT"" a good suspense thriller. It was an ""alright"" suspense/thriller. It had it's moments, the lipstick on the bathroom mirror was very predictable, albeit decent. Everything else seemed rushed, unrehearsed and generic. I mean the girl is crying and in desperation and hysterics almost and people are RIGHT UP CLOSE NEXT TO THEM in those non roomy airline seats, and no one catches an eyesoar or in earshot of whats going on. Poorly crafted.

The biggest criticism of all, is the very key, important dialouge which brings about the films energy when Cilian Murphy tells Rachel who he really is and what he needs her to do. It was just not belivable to this reviewer. In fact, in acting classes as an older teenager in Manhattan, there were more emotions and responses from tense scenes in our Improv class, than these two really had in their on screen chemistry, which was not that Four or Five star.

Brian Cox was bland, Wes Craven is just bored and throws out his acerebral films every once in a while to let us know he isn't buried six feet under yet, which, by all relative standards, is where this film deserves to be placed.

2442701,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" is an airborne thriller about a young woman (the stunning Rachel McAdams) who meets a stranger (Cillian Murphy) in an airport, and sparks instantly fly.  A short time later, she isn't too upset to find that they're seated together on the same plane.  The initial attraction isn't helped along too much, though, when the stranger whispers a dark secret about himself.

  The initial set-up has so much potential it would almost be hard for the filmmakers to mess it up, but the question was would it be able to hold up that edge-of-the-seat tension with the entire next hour (approximately) of the movie taking place with the two characters aboard a plane, usually seated right next to each other, without a high level of physical action.  Fortunately, the answer was an unequivocal Yes, with things not dragging or losing momentum for one minute.  It took a lot of skill to put this together, and McAdams and Murphy both deliver standout performances.  ""Red Eye"" is consistently innovative, quicker-paced than one might think by its premise, and believable.  It makes some nice swerves along the way, and nails the finale dead-on.  Among director Wes Craven's best in years and years, this one gets a strong 8.5/10",1179792000,2,1224,4.898058252427185

The plot is believable - which makes it more thrilling. This is one movie that you will not get bored during. I definitly recommend it!

I give Red Eye * * * * because it encapulates all that is good in a movie - suspense, deep characters, deep plot, and the urge to change the way you observe the world.",1174435200,2,526,4.25
2442703,5,B000BVM1SC,"Sometimes you don't need deep meaning in a movie, you just want to be entertained.  If you like suspense thrillers, this is one of those movies.

Rachel McAdams plays Lisa, a super organized manager of a luxury hotel without much of a personal life.  She is on a red eye flight from Texas to Miami, and meets a friendly guy in the airport, Jack Ripner (heh heh).  There's already indications that another shoe is going to drop and it does once the plane gets in the air--Jack is a bad guy, and he is threatening someone Lisa loves, to get her unwilling assistance in a government assassination plot.  Of course some of the details are a little far fetched, but the internal coherence of the plot keeps everything ticking along nicely and with a fair amount of suspense.  Although LIsa has some emotional moments, she's not a wilting violet heroine and keeps trying to figure out ways out of the situation.  Cillian Murphy plays Jack.  I don't know if it's his huge freaky eyes or the fact that the only other movie I've seen him in is Batman Returns, where he played the uber-creepy Scarecrow, but I found him much more believable once he turned nasty than when he was trying to win Lisa's trust with low-key nice-guyness.  But hey, he's VERY good at being bad.

This isn't a movie that will ever win awards or even get a lot of attention but it's very good at what it sets out to do.  Wes Craven is a master of atmosphere and every routine moment of airport check-in and later, of the airplane flight is imbued with a heightened level of tension.  I was hooked in, I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about, and rooted against the ones I was supposed to not like.  And aspiring screenplay writers take note:  it's very impressive how little time and few details are wasted in this movie.  Virtually every cameo character or briefly glimpsed item, from pens to a Dr. Phil self-help book, come into play.  There's nothing amazing about the movie except that, given how many B-movies are tossed into the marketplace with little care or craft, that time and care were spent on this movie.  It's a piece of craftwork rather than artwork, but it's a piece worth spending 90 minutes with.",1172880000,5,2198,4.538071065989848
2442704,4,B000BVM1SC,Wes Craven said that he made this film because the script was good but the story line is a bit absurd and the dialogue is nothing special. What saves the film is excellent directing by Craven who is a master at creating suspense. Rachel McAdams does a nice job as the heroine. She's so cute.,1169424000,3,291,4.3090909090909095
2442705,4,B000BVM1SC,"I purchased Wes Craven's Red Eye with some trepidation.  The reviews had been mixed, plus I hadn't enjoyed the other airplane movie, Flightplan, with Jodie Foster.  Still, I liked the star of the this movie, Rachel McAdams, having seen her in The Notebook, and the plot was somewhat intriguing.  I'm happy to say that the movie proved to be more noteworthy than I'd originally anticipated, and the film seemed to fly by like a twister moving through east Texas.  Though the ending was just a little predictable, the movie still held me by the seat of my pants, and I found myself rooting for Rachel McAdams to kick some serious butt.

The plot of Red Eye centers around Lisa (Rachel McAdams), who manages a luxury hotel in Miami, and her flight back from her grandmother's funeral.  On the flight, Lisa encounters a fellow passenger named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy--think of a young Eric Roberts), who appears nice and charming, but has deadly intentions.  Sitting next to Lisa on the plane, Jackson explains to her in a soft, calm voice that if she doesn't do exactly as told, her father (Brian Cox) will be murdered.  Jackson wants Lisa to call her hotel and see that a particular VIP, who's on his way to the hotel with his family, is switched to another room so that he can be killed.  Lisa finds herself in somewhat of a dilemma.  On the one hand, she doesn't want her father to die, while on the other, she doesn't want to set up a hotel guest to be murdered.  It becomes even more crucial when she discovers that the guest and his entire family will be killed.  What to do is the question.  Lisa tries a number of different things to alert fellow passengers, or the crew of the airplane, but to no avail.  All she ends up doing is upsetting Jackson, who quickly grows tire of her little games.  As the minutes tick away, Lisa realizes that a decision of some kind will have to be made.  Is she strong enough to do what's necessary? That's the real question which faces her, and it's one that had me glued to the TV screen as I awaited a solution to her dilemma.

Running at only eighty-five minutes, Red Eye is pretty much a non-stop, edge-of-your-seat thriller from a director who's better known for his horror movies.  Rachel McAdams is the perfect actress to play Lisa.  There's something very special about McAdams that shines on the screen.  Though she's young of age, there's still a strong sense of maturity about her that causes her to seem much older than she actually is. Add to that a physical beauty that's subtle, yet mesmerizing, and you have a woman who could easily become a major movie star in the next few years.  Cillian Murphy, while both handsome and menacing in his role, seemed just a tad too young for the character that he was playing.  I would've expected somebody else in his mid-to-late thirties to play the character of Jackson.  After all, this is supposed to be an experienced, professional assassin.  It usually takes a few years to develop the necessary skills for this type of profession.  Still, he did an adequate job of terrorizing Rachel McAdams.  One other person I'd like to mention is Brian Cox, who played Lisa's father.  I think I've seen Brian Cox in maybe thirty movies or more since he played Hannibal Lector in Manhunter back during the late eighties..  Almost every time I see him, I fail to recognize who he is because either he's lost weight, or put on weight, or disguised his facial features in some way.  It's his voice that always gives him away.  I would recognize his voice anywhere.  I wish that he were more recognized for his acting ability by the movie community.  This man can play any role he sets his mind to.  To sum things up, let me once again say that Red Eye is a well executed, fast-paced thriller that delivers far more than expected for a B-movie.  Even the minor characters on the airplane are given more to do than just fill the background like window dressing, as is usually the case.  Rachel McAdams does a superb job of playing a person caught between a rock and hard place, and what she's able to do with an ink pen brings back fond memories of Joe Pesci in Casino.  Definitely a good Saturday night movie!",1167955200,2,4196,4.548
2442706,3,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" is a fast-paced thriller directed by Wes Craven, who also directed the fabulous ""Scream"" trilogy. In ""Red Eye,"" a young hotel manager named Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is kidnapped by a man (Cillian Murphy) she encounters on a late flight to Miami. The strange man is part of a plot to assassinate a Homeland Security official (Jack Scalia) at the hotel where Lisa works. Lisa is instructed to call the hotel and arrange to have the government official's room switched, making it easier for the assassination plot to be carried out. There's a hit man sitting outside the home of Lisa's father, and if Lisa refuses to comply with her hostage, her father will be killed.

Overall, this is a pretty decent movie. It clocks in at only 85 minutes long, which is brilliant: Craven constantly keeps the action moving, and there isn't a dull moment in the film. Both McAdams and Murphy deliver excellent performances in their roles and have great onscreen chemistry together. I was pretty turned off by almost every other actor in the film, though: all the other performances seemed very overdone, which must have been a deliberate choice on Craven's part, but I found it kind of annoying.

This is an entertaining and suspenseful film. It's not up there with my favorite thrillers of all time and I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but ""Red Eye"" kept me thoroughly entertained for 85 minutes of my life.",1166400000,3,1399,4.753086419753086

2442728,3,B000BVM1SC,"I wanted to like this. I generally love Wes Craven. I generally love suspense. And while this was ""an action packed thrill ride"". It was a very flawed movie.

I did enjoy it. It's not by any means unwatchable, but it is implausible to the point where I couldn't stop laughing at the insane twists by the end of the film. Unfortunately, since the first 2/3 or so of the film were set up so well - very gritty, realistic, suspenseful, and very evocative of helplessness, that made the last part of the movie that much stupider. Suddenly we've gone from a creditable Hitchcock pastiche to a Warner Brothers cartoon. If it had been goofy all the way through, it would have been better than switching styles in mid-stream.

Also, while I like Wes Craven, he's got some serious issues - for one thing, the main two characters look AND ACT almost exactly like Sydney and Billy from Scream, and the dichotomy (she good/he bad) is identical, it just becomes clear a lot earlier. Wes needs to play with his own stereotypes and make a BAD brunette GIRL for a change.

RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm. It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.",1165104000,2,1267,4.476190476190476
2442729,4,B000BVM1SC,"If you like psychological thrillers, this flick is worth checking out.  It was directed by Wes Craven. You remember him, right?  He used to mainly do horror flicks such as the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series.  This movie proves that his talents are more diverse than some may have imagined.

The star of the show, however, is Rachel McAdams.  She is an up-and-coming starlet in Hollywood and I'm a HUGE fan of her's.  She is absolutely gorgeous, AND she has remarkable acting abilities AND (on top of all that!) she has  a genuine screen presence.  In the latter two regards, she's basically the antithesis of Paris Hilton.  Also, every time I see her in a movie I have this insatiable appetite to give her a great big hug as she's so adorable.  :)

In this film, she plays a vulnerable hotel manager who has a very rude person sitting next to her on a redeye flight.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, right?  Well, in this case she finds out that she must decide matters of life and death.  If this piques your curiousity, pick up the DVD!

I do hope that Ms. McAdams flourishes in Hollywood, and I see no reason why she shouldn't.  Of course, I thought Tawny Kitean had a lot of potential early in her career too, but she never made nearly as many movies as I would have liked.  Hopefully Ms. McAdams will be around for the long-haul.  Too many Hollywood film stars base too much on their physical good-looks and too little on their acting skills.

2442730,2,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye is a prime example of the fallacy of many, many thrillers: a strong start gives way to a dissapointing last act.  Through two thirds of the film, Wes Craven manages to engage the audience with an intriguing premise and some strong performances by the both McAdams and Murphy.  Sure, the terrorits plot, as is the case with most terror plots in movies, seems a bit too complicated to execute.  However, the pace of the film and the acting keep the audiences interest.  Then, once the plane manages to land in Miami, we are rushed through a thoroughly unsatisfying ending.  The final confrontation between the two main characters is ultimately anti-climactic.  The films leaves several important questions unanswered.  We never understand why the terrorist group wanted to dispose of the Homeland Security Official.  We never really understand the motivation of any of the characters in the movie.  A clever plot twist (and resolution) would be to find out that the intended target was actually an evil entity, and the people trying to stop him were actually trying to prevent a greater tragedy.  Something to that effect would have provided the audience with a better ending.  As it stands, a potentially great thriller turns into a mediocre one.",1164412800,3,1253,4.975961538461538

From the Scream trilogy to the debacle that was Cursed, it seemed like Craven had lost his edge.  The man who brought us terrifying, exploitation films like Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes, along with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street, may not go for the throat like he used to, but Red Eye is as close a return to form for the director that we'll get for a while.  Hottie Rachel McAdams stars as a hotel manager catching the red eye flight back home, and soon enough she turns the tables on the psychopath (Cillian Murphy, more menacing and eerie looking than in Batman Begins if you can believe that) looking to assassinate her father (Brian Cox).  There's really nothing we haven't seen before in Red Eye, but under Craven's guiding hand the tension and suspense are superbly crafted.  McAdams and Murphy are quite good as well, and the film is short but sweet, clocking in at under an hour and a half.

2442733,1,B000BVM1SC,"I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""The Last House on the Left"", but alas ""Red Eye"" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes.  I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few.

  As soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head, yeah it's that predictable. The main character Lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport. Her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight (creative title, huh) to visit daddy. Immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line, and he is obviously more than a destination point. While on the phone with Pops, Lisa puts him on hold to speak with Cynthia, a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip. Cynthia has to somehow be a victim.  Next Lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane; he is obviously the bad guy. Not just because of the random circumstances, but he has those bad guy eyes. The movie is over from my point of view, besides a few inconsistencies, the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if Lisa and Cynthia don't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel. Now we all know that this won't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings. That is why seven was a splendid film by the way, the villain was triumphant. The guy that sits next Lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie. It's all expected, and it's all dribble. Which may be why they made the movie PG-13, no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it.

 This movie could have been saved, if the villain had a better plan, if he was more convincing. If the protagonist wouldn't be so heroic if her morals wouldn't be so goody two shoes. If the movie wasn't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable.",1161907200,10,2516,4.273109243697479

Wes Craven, even though I love his other movies, has proven that he can do other things besides slashers and be amaazing.

The acting in the film was really well done and I wasn't disappointed at all with who I was watching this movie for, Cillian Murphey. He is one of the most talented recent actors to emerge. No matter how many times I see him in a movie, he always amazes me. As in Batman Begins, he makes an excellent villain. Rachel did an equally amazing job in the movie. Like I said, I tried to figure out what I would do in her place and it shows the acting talents of both the heroine and the villain.

Overall, if you are a fan of thrillers and movies that put you in that situation, this movie is for you.

I kept waiting for the other shoe to fall, for her to explain that she feels stronger since her tracheotomy (or whatever it was), and that's why she won't take any more guff from international terrorists.

She is so beautiful, you can't take your eyes off of her, and certainly those who question why such a young woman has such an important job at the hotel, well, a, of course she does, and b, on the other hand, is her job as important as all that?  She just seems to be some sort of glorified customer service flunky, making sure everyone gets mints on their pillow.  It's not like she's a brain surgeon.  OK, I was the first one to yelp when Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Lois Lane was played by Kate Bosworth, who looks all of 16, in the recent SUPERMAN RETURNS.  But indeed I think Rachel McAdams is ideally cast.  Bottom line, of course, she can do nothing wrong.  She could have played her own father too, and I would have been nodding my head, remarking for the 1000th time, she is so admirably versatile!

It's Cillian Murphy who seems stuck in a rut, first BATMAN BEGINS, then this, which is the same part, except, not as scary.  What will he play next, someone of the same ilk who actually doesn't commit any crimes?  Or mild ones, like jaywalking or not rewinding videotapes?  Well, if Rachel McAdams is in it, I'm there.

Looked like they had Brian Cox for one afternoon and managed to film all his scenes in rapid succession, thereby freeing him up for his eleven other 2005 releases.  You got to hand it to the man, he's everywhere, like brie.",1160524800,,2047,4.477088948787062
2442748,2,B000BVM1SC,"The Premise:

Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is travelling home on the last flight of the night (the red eye) to Miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is.

Rippner's reason for travel is strictly business. It so happens an assassination is planned on the Secretary of Homeland Security while he stays at Lisa's hotel. Rippner needs Lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the Secretary to stay in a different room. If she doesn't comply, he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him.

Thoughts:

This was one of my few experiences with Wes Craven's (Director) work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films I despise. I had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought, and when I finally saw it last night I knew next to nothing of what it was about. From what I vaguely remembered of the previews, and given Craven's reputation, I was honestly expecting Rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire. In hindsite, I think 'Vampire on a Plane' woulda been a much better foundation for a film.

To call this film's premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair. It's unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller. The problem with this film is how it executes those points. A hotel manager? The Secretary of Homeland Security? Give me a break! Make it the Deputy Director of the FBI and the President of the United States and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo. The concept of this film has potential, but how it was staged is just too ridiculous. Are we really to believe that the Secretary of Homeland Security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place. Are we really to believe that the only way this assassination (which involves missles did I tell you? I won't say anymore) can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the Secretary to stay in a different room? And who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed? And why?

The premise isn't only shaky, it's totally gutless. It sickens me that Hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people, situations or beliefs. It forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great Jack Ryan thrillers by Tom Clancy, The Sum of all Fears. In that film, instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by Isreal (which truly is something to fear), they decided to go with Nazi's. Heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are. I digress. My point is simply that Red Eye doesn't even go that far. It has no voice. It doesn't tell us anything, and worse, it's too spineless to put a face on fear.

There are some good things about the film. First and foremost is the cast. While Rachel McAdams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious Miami hotel, that part of her character is more of sidenote and it's a fault of casting more than her acting anyway. Cillian Murphy is very talented, and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next. I still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though. Finally we have the legendary Brian ""Better than Anthony Hopkins as Hannible Lector"" Cox. He's such a great actor, but in this film he's relegated to the most menial of roles. Almost every scene he's in is him answering the phone, being woken up by the phone, or picking up the morning paper.

The film is ok in it's first two acts, with the second act being the strongest part of the film where Rachel and Cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane. It's here that the tension builds, and the performances really hold the scenes. Then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness. The story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller. Instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type.

The Verdict:

Red Eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director. The actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat. If you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network TV thrillers, then you may find some enjoyment your first time through. It's not horrible, but neither is it really good.",1159920000,2,4846,4.566168009205984
2442749,3,B000BVM1SC,"...then you can be like me and rent this movie. But I have to say I disagree with anyone who calls this a top thriller. Hollywood has definitely had better offerings.

The story sounds interesting enough. Lisa Reisert goes to the airport, meets a suave gentleman who goes by Jackson, and finds herself sitting next to him on her flight.  Much to her dismay and horror, the man turns out to be an operative in a sinister plot to murder the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.  The catch is he needs Lisa to play a part in the plan otherwise a hitman will whack her poor daddy at home.  Lisa finds herself playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse aboard the plane and that's pretty much the gist of the film.  There's not much more to it.  No twists, no turns, just a straightforward flick with no surprises.

The acting was good. As in Batman Begins, Cillian Murphy made an excellent villain.  Rachel McAdams also did a good job in playing the emotional but independent hotel manager.  The script wasn't bad either.  Two thirds of the movie is shot on the plane, so the dialogue really carried the story.  The problem is the entire thing was just so predictable.  I was expecting more and was left wanting.

If you want an airplane thriller I would suggest Flightplan. Mentally it's more stimulating and it keeps you guessing until the end.  Not to mention Jodie Foster is an amazing performer.",1159833600,,1397,4.5582329317269075
2442750,2,B000BVM1SC,"More times than not you see a movie where you are dumbfounded how a storyline/script made it past the first trash bin by a studio executives desk.  Heck, with this masterpiece I was wondering how it made it out of the doorway of the screenwriters apartment.  This gives hope to all aspiring screenwriters, though....anything is possible.

Wes Craven is better than this, but he is joining a long list of quality Directors who are past their prime (John McTiernan, Oliver Stone, John Carpenter...the list could go on and on).  I figure he must have lost a wager somewhere down the road and had to pay up by putting his name on this film.

Rachel McAdams is kidnapped by a Cro-Magnum humanoid (that guys brow is impressive) 35,000 feet in the air and is forced to help him move the Secretary of Homeland Security into a penthouse/ocean view hotel room so that terrorists can blow him away with a rocket launcher.  She needs to do this or he has folks that will murder her father...and she just lost her Grandmother...so she has to do it.

Once you know the storyline, you know exactly what's going to happen, but it's pretty funny to watch unravel.

The movie loses what very little credibility it has when she uses a girthy Uniball pen to get off the plane.  I don't know about you, but if I were sitting remotely close to that scene, I would notice a violent arm move, a guy grasping his throat for dear life and a girl jumping out of her seat right as the seat belt sign is being turned off.

The fact this guy continues to run around even though he would have lost numerous quarts of blood is even more hilarious.  He wraps a scarf from TJ Maxx around his neck without a hint of a stain and he's off like Superman.

The last 3/4's of the movie is just horrendous, but I am giving this two stars because you can't beat the entertainment value of guys shooting a missile from a boat (the only boat on the water, by the way) and then tossing it into the ocean after blowing up the target even though there's a smoke trail 2 miles from their boat to the building.  Good plan, guys!!  I'm sure nobody saw that...and unless your boat has wings or submarine capabilities, it's not one of the better plans ever devised.

Add to that the actual explosion at the penthouse...dramatically shot from a low angle at the base of the highrise...where it basically looks like someone poured a lot of lighter fluid on a old Weber grill and set it on fire and you've got roughly five minutes of comedy that makes the previous hour and fifteen minutes tolerable.

A side note:  Too many Close Up's of Rachel McAdams.  Talk about pimples.  Man alive!",1159315200,2,2632,4.457202505219207
2442751,4,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven's contribution to the horror genre has been a lot of hits and misses. Several of his films have become classics of the horror genre; ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" are the two best examples of this while ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Last House on the Left"" have become cult classics but let's not forget some of his other failed attempts such as ""Deadly Friend"", ""Shocker"" and ""The People Under the Stairs"". ""Red Eye"" differs from most of Craven's previous work because it's not a horror film. It's a slick, well-crafted thriller that features a great cast, some genuinely intense scenes and heart-pounding suspense. Craven can gladly add ""Red Eye"" to his hits list.

Rachel McAdams plays Lisa- a young busy body who works at a chic resort Hotel. After attending her Grandmothers funeral, Lisa takes the ""Red Eye"" flight back home to Miami. At the airport, she bumps into a charming stranger named Jackson who offers her a drink and good conversation. As luck would have it, she ends up sitting right next to him on the flight. As their conversation progresses, it is soon made clear that the nice stranger isn't nice at all and his true motivations are exposed. His diabolical scheme involves an assassination plot and the frightened Lisa becomes his unwilling accomplice.

Finding a film that last under 90 minutes nowadays is a rare occurrence and one of the reasons this film had me glued to the screen was due to its rather short running time. There never really was a dull moment. The film didn't give me chance to get bored, get popcorn or even blink and the performances from the two leads were impressive. McAdams commanded my attention even during the film's less intense moments and Cillian Murphy proved he can be a mighty good villain.

Like Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"", ""Red Eye"" is a fast-paced, well-executed, well directed time-waster where normal people are suddenly thrown into a violent, diabolical world of murder and mayhem. With a running time of just under 90 minutes, it hardly gives you a chance to catch your breath. Recommended.",1159142400,,2078,4.831460674157303

2442753,4,B000BVM1SC,"Horror master Wes Craven did himself proud with this one. Red Eye is a lean, suspenseful thriller. It benefits from a snappy script, fine acting by Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, and, of course, competent, no-nonsense directing by you-know-you.

The film's plot centers around hotel manager Lisa Reisert (McAdams) taking a delayed redeye flight to Miami after attending her grandmother's funeral. At the airport, she meets a helpful charmer by the name of Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) and some kind of spark is lit. But, because this is a Craven film, all the flirty shenanigans soon give way to horrific cat-and-mouse tension as Lisa quickly becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate a high-level Homeland Security muckamuck (and his family) who happens to be staying at her hotel.

At a fleet 85 minutes, Red Eye contains no excess fat. We are propelled from scene to purposeful scene as Lisa and Jackson meet kinda cute and indulge in an airport flirtation, and then, whoosh!, the rug is pulled out from under. Even though the first two thirds of the film is pretty much a two-person character study, comprising of a playful-then-tense chatfest between Lisa and Jackson, it never gets dull for the audience.

Craven knows how to put the screws to ya. We feel Lisa's despair and helplessness in the face of Jackson's sudden heel turn. And, because these scenes take place inside the coach cabin, in front of other unknowing passengers, Lisa's attempts to maintain composure is all the more nerve-wracking and the more frustratingly felt by the audience. When Lisa locks herself in the restroom and finally has a chance to let go and cry it out, it's remarkably cathartic. The film's stressful atmosphere is heightened during the airplane scenes, due in large part to the confined surroundings. There actually is an easing of tension when Lisa disembarks (and subsequently goes into full-blown action heroine mode). Another factor in the film's favor is that Craven pays attention to detail with regards to the other plane passengers. Yeah, they're essentially background filler, but he just the same gives them throw-away context. It makes the premise seem more real.

Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy deserve great credit for their nuanced performances. Murphy, with his icy blue eyes that can shift from charming to menacing, translates well into a villain (but we already knew that from his role of the Scarecrow in Bats Begins). His character has enough calculated charisma that his ""chance"" meeting with Lisa and her resulting attraction for him are entirely plausible. If people weren't yet convinced that Rachel McAdams can act, well, this is another character she fully sinks into. So far, I haven't seen her repeat a role. And, even more than Murphy, she carries this movie. Her Lisa Reisert is resilient and resourceful and immensely likable. Also worth mentioning is wide-eyed Jayma Mays as the beleaguered hotel clerk Cynthia, who, before the end credits roll, informs Lisa, ""I think we had a really good night, all things considered - just that one incident, really."" Brian Cox, however, is wasted here in a, for all intents and purposes, ""damsel in distress"" role.

As for the special features, Red Eye has your typical ones: film commentary by the filmmakers (including director Wes Craven), a gag reel (the little girl is the funniest), a making-of featurette, and a segment focusing on Craven and his directing of Red Eye, ""Wes Craven: A New Kind of Thriller.""

Red Eye is a study in brisk, exciting, professional filmmaking. I doubt it won any awards but I betcha it gains a cult following. My male-driven, fact-based logic tells me so.",1158192000,,3666,5.031301482701812

Rachel McAdams was excellent, playing a woman who was capable of taking care of herself withour being a marshall arts expert.  Don't want to spoil anything, but the only disapointment I had was when 'dad' came to the rescue in the end.  After all she had handled on her own without help, I was hoping she wouldn't have to be ""rescued"" but would resolve things on her own.  I think she would have too had not dad shown up.

2442755,2,B000BVM1SC,"Can a movie be called a ""thriller"" when you always know what is about to happen?  The producers of ""Red Eyes"" must think so.

A slick criminal (Cillian Murphy) boards a plane with an unsuspecting woman (Rachel McAdams) and forces her to take part in an assasination plot.

The movie failed to ""thrill"" because it is the woman, and not this feared criminal that always seems to have the upper hand.  The feared villian comes off as an inept and weak and never really forces the woman to take part in the plot.  It might as well have been Ashton Kucher from ""Punk'd"" playing the villian.

The way the movie unfolds is very unimaginative and has no surprises at all.

Most of the movie amounts to pathetic begging on the part of the criminal for the woman to take part in his plot.  He repeats the same threats over and over again whenever she refuses.

There are no surprises or twists in the movie, and it arrived exactly where I thought it would, with no bumps or turns on the way.  The final action scene is laughably cliched and poorly done.

Despite the bland plot and lack of surprises, the actors were somewhat convincing (for at least the first 20 minutes anyways).  Of course, being convincing for 20 minutes when the script is so mediocre doesn't make a great movie.",1157760000,3,1274,4.491304347826087

And it does this mostly on board an airplane in scenes that pull off one of the great ironic puns in cinema history. This because the airline the heorine and bad guy are flying on is called Fresh Air.

Some nice scenes at L.A. International Airport and in Miami add realism to the storyline, which is pretty familiar but carried out very well by the actors. Craven's direction and strong film editing also star in this little movie, which delivers quite a wallop in a short stay.

The story concerns a young heroine (Rachel McAdams) and a really good looking bad guy (Cillian Murphy) who play tug of war on an airliner as the bad guy tries to help off a government official. Our heroine tries not to be extorted and to save her dad at the same time. The bad guy has an associate ready to delete her father if she doesn't cooperate.

The story becomes pretty predictable but still continues to surprise as it goes along. Scenes from the very beginning of the movie, cast under the weight of opening credits, come back during a fishing trip that really help deliver some action.

2442773,2,B000BVM1SC,"Accomplishing a successful thriller is not an easy thing to do. You've got to have a good script, great acting, a threatening atmosphere, and adequate directing. Pulling off a good psychological thriller is even tougher, most of the aforementioned items needing to be ratcheted up a few notches. The standard by which I use to gauge these types of films is (no surprise) THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Perfect in every way, this film is a top-shelf example of the genre.

Director Wes Craven is better known for his slasher-thrillers (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, etc.), but here he's taking a shot at something a bit less bloody. And while RED EYE succeeds on a few levels, it fails miserably in several others.

The story: Lisa (Rachel McAdams, THE FAMILY STONE) is flying from L.A. to Miami and is about to meet up with a psychopath, Jackson (Cillian Murphy, BATMAN BEGINS). Their first meeting is in the airport prior to boarding and it appears as if a romance is blooming between the two. But once aboard the Red Eye flight, Jackson quickly reveals his true scheme for getting so close to Lisa. Lisa is the manager of a high-profile Hotel in Miami and many politically active people stay there. One of these people must die, according to Jackson and whomever he represents. Jackson also has an ace up his sleeve: he's got a man with a gun sitting outside Lisa's father's house and if this politician doesn't die, Lisa's father will. So Jackson orders Lisa to move this political figure to another room, one with a more exposed balcony. Lisa calls the hotel (while they're in the air) and orders the room switch. But what will become of the politicians family? And Lisa's father?

The good. Compartmentalizing the story in an airplane was genius. This forced close-up shots of the actors in this constrained environment and leant an explosive atmosphere to the movie. You could feel Rachel McAdams' character wanting to burst free of the plane. Cillian Murphy is just flat-out creepy. He can play the bad guy extremely well and I hated his character (that's a good thing).

The bad. Once they leave the plane, the story gets a bit silly. We lose the compartmentalization feel and get into the standard chase scenes which were pretty weak. There are also side stories which we briefly glance but are never given insights to. The one that leaps out at me is the little girl flying alone for the first time. What was her purpose in the movie? I also thought the older lady that Lisa gives her book to was a bit forced. To ramp up the excitement, I would've liked to have seen Jackson kill the old gal on the plane then try to hide it. And, again, after we leave the plane, the story devolves into a standard storyline that is completely predictable. Does Lisa's dad survive? Does Lisa? Do the politician and his family get away without being assassinated? Will Jackson get away with his plan? If you know predictable films, you know the answers to all of these without ever watching RED EYE.

Finally, let me say that Mr. Craven needs to stick to his chosen genre and not try and branch out like this unless he's willing to go all the way. And by all the way, I mean give us a story that we don't already know the ending to.",1152662400,2,3224,4.590277777777778
2442774,4,B000BVM1SC,"`Red Eye' is a good example that proves you can make a riveting thriller with moderate amount of money if you have A) more than one talented actors and B) first-rate director who knows the genre. Here we have Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy for A and Wes Craven for B, and none of them would disappoint you in this above-average thriller.

The film's intriguing premise (by the first-time writer Carl Ellsworth) is simply this; Lisa (McAdams) sits next to one charming guy Jackson Rippner (Murphy) on a delayed flight to Miami. Nothing is wrong with this bumpy flight except that Jackson is actually a freelance assassin who orders Lisa - obviously a very competent but otherwise ordinary working lady -- to do something that concerns national security.

The lean film has only 85 minutes, and has no sub-plot about, say, Lisa's boyfriend. Her daddy appears, played by Brian Cox, who plays an important role by mostly staying out of the screen, but the film's best moments happen in the claustrophobic sequences on the airplane, heightened by the convincing acting from the two leads. The fact is `Red Eye' is most powerful when the camera decides to show the close-ups of the two in the confined space of the flying plane, which was totally missing from `Flight Plan.'

`Red Eye' has lots of conventions of thriller, but Craven uses them cleverly without trying to hide that fact from the audiences. Instead, he embraces them, and even enjoying doing them. That's exactly what we need because we are watching this film for fun, and Craven knows it. The long wrap-up part looks to me rather silly, with our heroine holding a hockey stick, but even then the film remains watchable thanks to the excellent performances from the two rising stars of the film.",1151366400,2,1757,4.811258278145695
2442785,3,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye has many good points that make it exciting, interesting, and worth watching, however it has a few aspects that make it seem implausible, unrealistic, and ultimately not really worth seeing more than once.

First, the good:

- Red Eye is fast-paced at less than an hour and a half, making it clock in at the lower time requirement even for films of its genre. Its fast pace ensures that events happen quickly and that the film has little chance to get too boring

- The special effects/stunts are good, particularly those involving the stinger missile launch, the SUV crashing into the house, and people falling down stairs

Then, the not as good:

- Red Eye seems to be one of those films whose tension translates better when shown on a big screen, in a theatre full of other people on a Saturday night. Watching it at home on DVD with only one or two other people makes the film feel a lot weaker. Sequences that should be suspenseful or scary come off as kind of formulaic and cliche (example, a man enters a house weilding a knife instead of the more obvious and effective automatic pistol, chases after a woman who screams, runs upstairs, locks herself in a bathroom, screams some more, etc.).

- Cillian Murphy, while certainly possessed of a sharp-featured, good-looking face and piercing blue eyes, is physically not very imposing or threatening. Murphy is good at acting in a frightening way, and the way he speaks in the movie at times makes him seem scary, but overall he seems simply too small to be a real tough guy. This might be counterbalanced if he seemed like an evil genius, but his character really doesn't come off as being a genius in the movie -- instead he comes off more like a smug jerk who orders people around and eventually he can't even adapt to a changing situation when his initial plan fails. These do not look like the actions of a genius.

- Some of the movie's attempts at humor seem forced and unfunny. Example, Rachel McAdams' character has a coworker at the hotel who is charged with taking care of some important business in the manager's absense, but the coworker manages to bungle nearly everything, and her incompetence and total lack of knowledge and professionalism are supposed to be funny. They aren't.

Overall Red Eye is an okay movie to watch once, but it really isn't as exciting as it thinks it is, or rather, as many people think it is. It might have been so awesome if the main villain could have been Ralph Fiennes or Kelsey Grammer (complete with clipped, aristocratic accent), and the main heroine was Diane Lane or Audrey Tatou or somebody like that, but obviously such actors are priced too high for a film like this.

Red Eye is a film strictly for rental; owning it and watching it collect dust will only remind you of a foolish purchase.",1150675200,,2806,4.596

This is a one trick movie, the plot is just what you expect, there are no twists and turns.  Still, its not a bad film.  The strenghth of the movie is between lead actors Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers) and Cillian Murphy.  They meet while their flight from Dallas to Miami is delayed.  They hit it off and have a great relationship and even end up sitting together on the plane.  Coincidence?  No, of course not.

Murphy quickly reveals he has alterior motives.  His job is to force McAdams to call the hotel where she works and have a important political figure's room changed to one easily accessible to assassins.  To make things worse, bad guys have McAdam's dad and if she doesn't obey, he'll be killed.

2442789,5,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven's latest offering is also his best, imo (better than ""Scream""). ""Red Eye"" is taut, tense, and terrific, clocking in at a lean 85 minutes. It is engaging throughout - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, despite most of the movie taking place on a cramped airplane. Very well-acted, smartly-written, and thrilling throughout, ""Red Eye"" is the perfect summer movie. (It's also a great date movie, because it's fun to have someone to grab onto during some on the scenes.) Lisa Reisert (terrifically played by Rachel McAdams) is waiting around to catch a much-delayed red-eye flight to Miami, to see her father and return to work as a hotel manager after her grandmother's funeral. She meets Jackson Rippner (an excellent Cillian Murphy), who, at first, is very charming, but later reveals his sinister plans for Lisa - if she doesn't comply with his instructions to make some hotel rearrangements, he will have someone kill her dad.

The movie is well-written - infused with black humor, wry observations of airplane travel (annoying/rude passengers, loud kids, etc.), and even an added dimension to Lisa and Jackson's relationship (I don't know - I thought there was something more to the cat and mouse thing, but my friends disagree with me).

Besides the terrific writing, it is also a testament to the acting skills of McAdams and Murphy that they were so terrorized of/terrorizing to each other, since they are seated within a few inches of each other for most of the movie. McAdams is awesome, effectively capturing the intelligence, charm, and strength of her character. She is really blossoming into a major actress. Murphy is just as awesome; he radiates intense creepiness and a weird kind of charm. He and McAdams have amazing chemistry together, effectively playing off each other's strengths and weaknesses. (On a vain note, they are really hot together on screen - and I'd love to see them in a real romantic comedy or another thriller as good as this one.)

In a summer of big, dumb blockbusters, ""Red Eye"" is a welcome and pleasant surprise. Out of the many movies I've seen this year, this one had the best audience participation, which was half the fun. Don't miss this winner! 4.5/5",1149033600,3,2218,4.862433862433862
2442790,1,B000BVM1SC,"I had better say frankly right from the start that I loathed this film. It seemed to me like a bad melding between the soap-opera ""Friends"" and a badly made thriller from the 70s.

With that in mind, I'll explain the elements of ""Red Eye"" which led me to be gravely disappointed by it.

1. A young woman named Lisa Reisert (played by Rachel McAdams) holds the pivotal position in a hotel which caters for important persons for whom security is an absolute must. In fact, so important is her position that whatever she says goes. To go even further, what she says goes even when she is absent and making a phone call to her ditzy assistant. This is so unlikely as to have me rolling my eyes.

2. The ditzy assistant is in charge while the super-powered young woman played by Rachel McAdams is away, having had to attend her grandmother's funeral. Ms Ditzy has no confidence in herself, hasn't the experience or expertise to run a hotel, and is more likely to be (realistically) someone's secretary, given a month's warning to gain a more professional look and attitude. As someone with an authoritative position, even temporarily, in a major hotel dealing with senators and such... no. Absolutely no.

3. The assassination plan used by the assassins in this film is incredibly unlikely, complicated, ridiculous, ludicrous, expensive, and flawed. There are easier ways, and more likely-to-succeed ways.

4. While on her way back to work (having caught the last plane that night), Lisa Reinert is able to make a phone call to have  William Keefe (assassination target) moved from one room to the other, without its being challenged or questioned other than a ""Why?"" and an agreeable ""Okay"" at the weak explanation. No one seems to question this.

5. The threat held against Lisa is that unless she co-operates, Jack Ripner the pleasant-faced assassin sitting next to her (played quite nicely in a charmingly menacing way by Cillian Murphy) will make a phone call to a killer sitting outside her father's house. The killer will murder Lisa's father upon receiving that call. Well... why did Lisa not simply punch her fists into the assassin's temples or otherwise incapacitate him, explain the situation to the aeroplane crew, and tie up the assassin so that he could not MAKE that phone call? This glaring plot hole had me looking with disbelief at the screen while the DVD played merrily on.

6. The entire ludicrous chase after the plane reached the ground... words fail me. Whatever tension was ever created in the claustophobic confines of the plane is lost irrevocably.

The characters of Lisa, Jack and the ditzy assistant look as though they strayed out of a ""Friends"" film. Nothing about the cinematography conveys the thriller aspect which the film is supposedly intent upon conveying. The characterisation is poor (even Jack's character, although nicely played, is terribly stock-clich - we've all seen the nice-guy assassin type before in many, many films). The story is full of holes. It just... doesn't look or feel right to me.

The title ""Red Eye"" has really nothing to do with the film. It gives the impression that the film's nail-biting action occurs on board the flight, but I can assure you that most of the film occurs on the ground, and nail-biting tension is remarkable for its absence, not its presence.

To be candid, even had the storyline been ""patched"" so that it no longer had the plot holes I've mentioned, I still would have loathed this film. It was the look and feel of it by which I'm most deeply antagonised. Wes Craven has done much, much better things - I doubt he'll do worse.

In short... I cannot recommend this film to anyone. If you want a tight, gripping thriller, well acted and shot in a way to increase the tension, look elsewhere.",1147996800,12,3774,4.78923076923077
2442791,2,B000BVM1SC,"**1/2

""Red Eye"" is a so-so friendly-skies thriller that starts off fairly well but becomes increasingly less plausible as it rolls along.

Rachel McAdams is a hotel manager, deathly afraid of flying, who is returning to Miami after the funeral of her grandmother.  Sitting in the seat next to her is a seemingly pleasant young man (played by Cillian Murphy) who turns out to be part of a plot to assassinate the director of the Department of Homeland Security who is staying in McAdams' hotel.  The plan is to get her to switch the director's room so that the killers can get a better shot at him and his family.  As a way of securing her help, the assassins are threatening to kill her father if she doesn't cooperate.

Although this is little more than a standard-issue potboiler, the scenes in the plane are reasonably effective at creating a modicum of suspense and believability, given the claustrophobic nature of the setting.  But once the jet lands and McAdams and Murphy start chasing each other through the airport and, eventually, all over greater Miami, credibility flies out the window and we're left with a silly little thriller that spins completely out of control and that provokes laughter from us in all the wrong places.

Like the plot itself, the film stays airborne for awhile, then crash lands.",1147564800,3,1317,4.79646017699115
2442792,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table. At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen. We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States. Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected. Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on. If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the ""Halloween"" episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid. That does not mean that director Wes Craven (""Scream/2/3"") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent. The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the ""end"" because ""X"" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.

The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell. At this point many of you will be thinking back to ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence. Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams, who suddenly appears to be in every other movie being made) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral. Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates. He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.

I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about ""Red Eye."" Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and ""Batman Begins,"" Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles). But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists. Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table. But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).

The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams. In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress. After being the blonde Queen Bee in ""Mean Girls"" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did ""The Notebook."" Then in 2005 she made ""Red Eye"" in between ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Family Stone."" She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting. Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim. There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.",1147478400,,3770,4.390557939914163
2442793,4,B000BVM1SC,"After reading some less than glowing reviews of Red Eye (though most were good) I was tempted to give the movie 5 stars since I really though it was a very good to great movie.  But in reality, thats what four out of five means....very good to nearly great.  The movie starts fast and as most have said, with just 83 minutes of movie time, the pacing is fast.

This movie works for many reasons.  One thing I like about it is the absence of a 'superstar' such as Jodie Foster from ""Flightplan"".  The acting in ""Red Eye"" is just as good or better than flight plan and the lack of a star only adds to the characters instead of the actors.  Another thing-along those same lines-I like about Red Eye as opposed to Flight Plan is the fact that the characters (and the plane) on Red Eye are or seem to be regular people.  Lisa Reiser is a hotel manager...a bit of a yuppie but far from elite.  It shows how decent everyday people can get involved in extraordinary circumstances.

After the landing the action get more predictable and less creative, but it still makes for a good overall movie.  I have some points that maybe others thought of too.  Not to overanalyze the movie, but assume a situation like this in which the victim (Lisa) was not able to stop the assassination after she (under duress) put the steps into motion.  Would she be charged as a terrorist??  Afterall, she still set it up.  This is a tough question and there are others the movie avoids by giving us a happy ending.  It is a heck of a ride that is worth purchasing.  To me it is by no means a ""B"" movie as someone called it.",1147046400,2,1596,4.287625418060201

Director Wes Craven, whose films I generally don't like, has pared away everything that isn't absolutely necessary.

2442816,4,B000BVM1SC,"Over the years I have been more than a little bit dissapointed with Wes Craven Directoral works, it's not that I thought that he had lost his edge or ability but more that he was just in some what of a slump, though the movie was not flawless or spectacular like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""The People Under the Stairs"" or the ""Scream' trilogy, it was simply a good prototype of an exciting thriller. Obviously Mr. Craven changes his movie making style to a more suspenful thriller type and somewhat leaves behind his slasher roots, I think one of the reasons that I was so pleased after seeing this movie was because I thought that it might be bad just like every other movie he has made since ... well ... ""Scream"", I mean come one have any of you people seen ""They"" or ""Cursed"" ..... BARF!

One of ""Red Eyes"" strengths was it's cast, Rachel McCadams was very good in playing the lead role while Cillian Murphy nails his first shot at being a Villian, (I mean he is interesting enough trust me when I say that he is a very believable in this role), not only the to lead charactors but as a whole everyone did their part to make this movie successful.

Something that did bother me SOMEWHAT was that the movie seemed way too short ... I thought that if the movie would have been a little bit longer, the middle of the film and the climatic ending could have been even more suspencful, thrilling and even all around better as a film.

I thought that the story line was very well put together even though it was pretty cleshea, everything seemed to fall in place pretty well and there was alot of falling action that led up to the climax very well. I think one more bad thing about this film is it's predictability

Overall I must say that I was pretty impressed with Wes Cravens new style and directoral effort in this roller coaster suspence ride ... I hope that ""Red Eye"" will lead to more good films by Craven the near future, Recommended to all ... well most.

Perhaps you're sitting on a park bench and you see a jogger coming toward you and you wonder if maybe that jogger has a knife and is actually running aiming for you. That's the feeling I got when watching Red Eye-- an imaginative nightmare in which one bad thing leads to yet another bad thing. Someone's imagination apparently got the best of them when writing this movie. Yes, it's far-fetched, though that seems a petty reason to dislike this fun Friday night flick, as most movies are generally far-fetched.

Rachel McAdams stars as Lisa, a hotel manager who's on a red eye flight back to Miami, the locale of her hotel as well as the place her father lives. In the airport, a friendly gentleman named Jack Rippner, ignore the silly, contrived name, (Cillian Murphy-- frightening in his aspect) buys the nervous flyer Lisa a drink before the flight. They part ways as their plane begins to board. But what do you know! Jack and Lisa are sitting next to each other. I love the trailer for this film. It's made to look like a romantic comedy, until the camera zooms in on Murphy's evil and powerfully piercing blue eyes. That's exactly what we get here: Jack is not a good person. As a matter of fact, he's going to kill Lisa's father if she refuses to authorize a change of room in her hotel for a politician, whom Jack is looking to assassinate.

Very thrilling movie, great performances, especially from Murphy, though I don't expect anything less than creepy from him. The man radiates creepiness. Pictures of him make me cringe because I feel like his bright blue eyes are burning through my skin.

Red Eye is a thriller in the classic sense. Most  of lt takes place on a closed plane area...Think Lifeboat in a plane! It is psychological melodrama with a twist of political thriller. Under the  skilled direction of Wes Craven, this thriller ride takes flight. Craven  seem to take a page or two from the playbook from the Master of Thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock with a twist or two of  his own added in.

Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from Batman  Begins) is extra  creepy here as he sits next to Lisa (played by Wedding Crasher's Rachel McAdams). Murphy threats Lisa in his soft cooing voice with her father's death if she doesn't move a poltico pemarked for death  into a  special hotel suite. He does his threats  in such a way that anyone would be scared of him. The film is scary and supensiful due to Murphy's quiet anger. The political thriller angle  seem slightly taken  from the film ""Nick of Time"" with  Johnny Depp

The setting is tense and claustrophobic on the plane where Lisa cannot escape the threats that Jackson continually hounds her with and Cillian Murphy is thoroughly menacing as a terrorist who is driven to finish his mission.

But one truly has to suspend their disbelief in order to buy into it.  More happens in the space of this couple of hours than in most people's lifetimes, which is okay in a thriller.

However, what inspired me to write this review is one of the special features on the DVD: ""Wes Craven: A New Kind of Thriller.""  I started to watch this and couldn't get through it.  The title alone is so ridiculous it makes one laugh.  This is definitely NOT a new type of thriller.  There is NOTHING new about this movie.  It is like 10,000 other movies out there, from the pedestrian plotting to the hackneyed characterizations.

As I said in the first graph, it's on okay thriller.  It is certainly not the worst.  But, hype or not, to be so removed from any semblance of reality as to even suggest this is a new type of thriller is beyond belief.

Can anyone tell me what's ""new"" about this thriller???  What makes it different from just about any other thriller out there?

""Hollywood,"" in article after article, constantly complains that there are no good scripts out there.  Not so.  But, as with this movie, they more often than not prefer the safe rather than something truly original that might be called ""a new kind of thriller.""",1143504000,,1499,4.526119402985074
2442838,3,B000BVM1SC,"I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but Wes Craven's thriller ""Red Eye"" kept me at arm's length and didn't quite click.  And that's despite having so many elements that I admire and enjoy in a film.

Even though I refrained from checking out all reviews before seeing ""Red Eye"" (recommended strategy for avoiding ""spoilers"" before seeing certain movies), I was disappointed when the DVD itself acted as a spoiler of sorts.  Before you get to the opening DVD menu, the DVD shows several brief cuts of scenes from the movie.  I knew enough about the movie to know that it takes place largely in an airplane, but there is one snippet from DVD's ""menu cuts"" that gives away a huge clue about the action that's going to take place later in the movie and not on the plane . . . and it frustrated me -- why bother avoiding the spoilers from film critics if the DVD's going to have its own spoilers?  (This is, obviously, a criticism of the DVD rather than the movie itself.)

The plot of ""Red Eye"" is well-summarized in other reviews.  The movie asks you to suspend quite a bit of disbelief.  First, the two leads, Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, are very young to play the characters they do.  Are we to really believe that McAdams' character, who looks all of 25, is really the most trusted, powerful figure for one of the ritziest hotels in Miami?  Not that I'm a hotel expert, but she seems quite young.  And Cillian Murphy must be one heck of a prodigy to have his job, given that he also looks to be in his rakish late twenties.  He's an excellent actor (""28 Days Later,"" ""Batman Begins""), as is Ms. McAdams, but couldn't we find some actors who, you know, look 30?

""Red Eye"" has some clever moments, and they are very enjoyable.  But there are also some very obvious moments.  First, it's a Wes Craven movie, so it's a given that you're going to have a damsel-in-distress running around her house being chased by a madman.  Mr. Craven -- how many times have you written that scene?  Isn't it time for something new?

Also, there's an early scene where Ms. McAdams takes an unusual amount of guff from whiny ""ugly American"" hotel patrons.  If you would be surprised to learn that (mild spoiler alert) she later tells these two twits to go stuff themselves, well, then ""Red Eye"" is your ""Speed.""

Don't get me wrong -- I admire much about ""Red Eye,"" including its courage to only go 85 minutes.  (Too many movies these days outstay their welcome, even at 90 minutes -- ""Red Eye"" feels just about right.)  But with a couple of half-baked moments and so much potential, I couldn't help feel like ""Red Eye"" didn't even try to reach its full potential.",1142899200,,2652,4.492693110647181

2442840,5,B000BVM1SC,"This movie does what it says it's going to do. It is a throat grabber, a movie where the unexpected happens. McAdams is convincing as a young woman in an important job who keeps her cool. We know that something is a little off with her because we see a scar on her chest. She's a customer service maven, a manager of the wealthy Miami Lux hotel, and she's afraid of flying.

Murphy on the other hand is a good villain, fairly amoral, not interested in money or companionship, but willing to kill to get his target acquired and then resolved.

The other roles are even handed and while they are certainly peripheral, we get a chance to see them interact with McAdams when times are smooth and later on when things become unglued.

Kudos as always to Wes Craven who keeps us on the edge of our seats as he weaves the tale one by one closing the doors that lead to any escape of the heroine.

It's not a slasher movie. It's just a good old fashioned scary mystery. It does seem to come apart and unravel a little at the ending. But it's not Tolstoy nor does it have any pretentions. Mr. Craven gives us a few hints along the way of what's going to happen: the aforementioned scar.

2442842,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" deserves three-and-a-half stars more than four, but I graded it up for one simple reason:  It isn't boring.  So many of today's so-called ""thrillers"" are just dull.  With ""Red Eye,"" Wes Craven manages to create a bit of suspension by skillfully building up our primary characters in Lisa(the lovely Rachel McAdams) and Jackson(the sinisterly perfect Cillian Murphy).  When we are first introduced to Lisa, we learn that she's the one solid rock in a world full of chaos.  She helps a co-worker, talks with the taxi driver, and has a phone conversation with her father all at once.  She appears to be very control of not just her life, but the world around her as well.  Jackson's the typical gentleman, almost too nice.  He handles a situation that could have gotten nasty in a very nice and toned down way.  He is precise and calculating.  With these aspects of our primary characters fleshed out, we get on the red eye flight to Miami with them.

Calculating as ever, Murphy's character makes sure that he and McAdams end up seated together.  As the plane takes flight, Murphy makes a proposition to McAdams.  It's a proposition that can quickly tear her world apart.  Does she give in to Jackson, or does she try to outwit him?  I can't say much more without giving away the conclusion of the film.

Just know that this is an above-average thriller.  It won't make you fear flying anymore than you already do, but it will hold your attention for its brisk running time.  It's worth a look, and perhaps a purchase.

Though, after this one, he might be typecast to do roles leaning more towards villians.

It all starts with a normal, everyday, hotel manager who's flying back home. Whilst waiting for the plane she meets a friendly stranger who instantly clicks with her.

2442864,3,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye (Wes Craven, 2005)

Wes Craven released two movies in 2005; Cursed was the flop, and Red Eye was the hit. What I find interesting is that the two movies aren't that far off from one another: full of young-and-beautifuls doing their thing, while we, the audience, are invited to watch.

The main difference between the two movies is that Red Eye does not, thankfully, have a Kevin Williamson-penned script; most of Craven's troubles started when he hooked up with Williamson, and since 1996, Craven's movies have, to a one, been better when Williamson is not writing them. Here, teleplay writer Carl Ellsworth adapts his own short story. The good news is, it's not Kevin Williamson. The bad news, which isn't so bad, is that Red Eye reads, as one might expect, like an episode of your basic TV thriller.

In this episode, Lisa (Rachel McAdams, of Mean Girls fame) is returning home after a funeral, rushing to catch the red eye. Typical airport stuff. She runs into a stranger-- I don't want to say handsome stranger, though I'm sure some folks will find him such-- named Jackson (28 Days Later's Cillian Murphy, who looks far better with a beard) a couple of times, then finds out he's got the seat on the plane next to hers. While every trailer, ad, and copy has told you what Jackson's deal is, why should I?

There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away, and actually, you've seen a good deal of it before. Craven, in his prime, could have still turned such a derivative work into a blissfully stylish Craven masterpiece; here, while his touch is certainly felt, it still comes off rather like a particularly brilliant episode of Magnum, P. I. ***",1141171200,2,1667,4.659863945578231

It is about a man and a women who get on a plane and the man is organising a murder. He bribes the women to do different things for him.

2442866,4,B000BVM1SC,"There's not a whole lot about this movie I can say without giving things away. I really enjoyed it, as did the rest of my family - which is rare because we all have different tastes. It kept us all on the edge of our seats and I really don't think any of of us lost interest once. My dad even managed to say awake the whole time which is a big deal because my dad falls asleep during his favorite shows much less something he's never seen before.

Okay, this is about a young business woman named Lisa who I think is a hotel manager. She's something big for a fairly well to do Miami hotel. She's had a death in the family and is coming back from the funneral to her home in Miami via the red eye. While waiting on her delayed flight, she meets Jackson, a seemingly clean-cut, nice guy. Anyone who's seen the previews knows Jackson's not really so nice and he poses Lisa with an ultimatium - call her hotel and tell them to move a senator who's coming to a less secure room or they kill her dad. Once the senator is dead, they'll leave her dad alone.

I highly recommend this one. It was alot of fun to watch and I was actually rooting for the heroine - even though she does slip up and do the sterotypical thriller heroine stuff such as trip and fall during a chase scene and trap herself several times.",1140912000,,1304,4.150197628458498
2442867,2,B000BVM1SC,"The first half of RED EYE is fairly suspensful and absorbing mostly due to the excellent evil-doer acting of Cillian Murphy, who ""kidnaps"" our heroine, played by Rachel McAdams, on a red eye flight in order to assassinate a Home Security bigwig. Thriller movies like this rise or fall depending on the quality of the actor playing the villian (and the script backing him or her up). Reference is made to DIE HARD as an example where a strong and interesting villain character made the film. And for the first part of RED EYE we have a suave, clever, smooth, manipulative, dangerous bad guy in Mr. Murphy. Then, suddenly, all that falls apart. Murphy's character becomes a pathetic victim of the super woman heroine. But we won't give away any more plot information. The point is, it went from scary believeable to laugh-out-loud unbelieveable. Wes Cravens, the horror film vet, directed this non-horror effort. Perhaps he should stick to the horror genre in future.",1140825600,3,965,4.890243902439025
2442868,2,B000BVM1SC,"I do not expect all thrillers to be works of pure genius, but I do expect most of them to be smarter than ""Red Eye,"" a marvel of idiotic set-ups, asinine plot turns, and ridiculous pay-offs. This is a screenplay so unbelievably bad that not even two very fine young actors and a director known for his knack for suspense can salvage it.

The premise: hot young hotel employee Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is returning home to Miami after her grandmother's funeral. Trapped in the web of airline travel, she befriends hunky, mysterious Jackson Ripper (Cillian Murphy) and finds him charming, unaware that a name like ""Jackson Ripper"" is about as subtle as a brick to the skull. (Why not just get it over with and name him Evil McSneakyton? Stabby O'Kidnapper? Willie Killus?)

Anyway. The idea of having a thriller disguised in the first act as a quaint romance of sorts would be clever, except: a) the trailer (which, by the way, somehow contains more thrills in its two minutes than the feature does in ninety) already gave away the surprise, and b) the film is populated with so many outlandishly hackneyed side characters that it's impossible to focus on the main event. Why, there's the little old lady who's not very bright but is so nice to Lisa! Hey, there's the eleven-year-old girl who's flying all by herself for the very first time! Look, it's the cranky rich guy who complains about everything! All we're missing here is a singing nun, or at least a jive-talking Barbara Billingsley.

Anyway again. It turns out that Bad Guy Q. Villainy is part of an elaborate plot to assassinate a top government official. The movie begs us to accept the idea that this entire plan revolves around a hotel desk manager, who must phone work and order them to movie said top government official to a new, unchecked-by-security-or-Secret-Service room for no real reason, and if she doesn't, some guy will kill her dad. Oh, and Dastardly J. Scoundrel is required to force her to do this while sitting in the busiest section of the airplane, with a good twenty people in earshot. You'd think he'd at least bother to whisper.

Now, of course none of this is supposed to matter. We're supposed to be so caught up in the danger of it all - how will Lisa outwit her stalker? - that we're not supposed to quibble over the finer points. But these finer points are so sloppily handled that it makes no matter how well McAdams and Murphy come across. (For the record, they do the best they can with the ridiculous material, and watching them not drown in all the stupidity showcases their talent. It's a thankless film, the stupid action thriller that they do in between better projects, just to keep their stars rising. In a few years, they'll both be superstars, and nobody will bother remembering this lame early effort.)

As for director Wes Craven, well, he sleepwalks through this one enough to provide a serviceable effort, but he never overcomes the script's faults. In fact, at times, Craven seems to revel in the stupidity. He does well enough in the film's middle section - the part in which Lisa and Gary Hitler square off on the plane - and while these moments are pretty stupid, at least the movie's not falling completely apart. Then we move into the third act, where they get off the plane, the action ramps up, and we have a big, dopey guy reacting to the sight of a missile flying right at him (funniest part of the movie, by the way), or we have the Grumbling, Self-Absorbed Hotel Guests finally getting their comeuppance, or we have forty other things happening that suggest the story should've stayed on the plane through the whole film. (The Johnny Evil-stalks-Lisa-through-dad's-house bit is quite the yawnfest.) Craven can't keep up with everything the script tosses his way, and he eventually gives in, figuring people that like big explosions will have a good time anyway, so why bother trying to make it good?

Maybe I wouldn't be so hard on ""Red Eye"" had I not already seen ""Flightplan,"" another stuck-on-a-plane thriller with more than its fair share of questionable logic. That film got right what ""Red Eye"" got wrong: its thrills are tight and effective, its characters interesting, its situations increasingly involving. ""Red Eye,"" on the other hand, relies too heavily on undercooked ideas and laughable developments.

Wes Craven has disowned his earliest, most twisted works, and his career since Nightmare on Elm Street has been a quest to break out of his horror film cubbyhole. The Scream series was a respectable compromise; he could churn up plenty of rent money by reinventing the slasher film, while demonstrating that he was above it all by cleverly sending up the genre.

This movie is not clever, or imaginative, or much of anything other than a waste of time. The plot points are contrived, the director cheats with lazy jumps in the action which undercut any real suspense, and there is nothing we haven't seen done before, and better. Except maybe one scene, and that's not worth the price of admission.

But what distinguishes ""Red Eye"" from the latter is some really profound characters' study. For some reason Jody Foster's film was a one night stand for me, but I really enjoyed ""Red Eye"" and I think I'm gonna enjoy it again one day. The script is very well written, the characters are vivid and lively, and director's work gives away a real professional. Wes Craven is a true professional, although he used to make low-budget horror movies that sometimes were silly and naive. But now we see that given if not a megabudget, but a pretty decent one, he can make good cinema without a lot of effort seemingly. Once he already made an excellent film with big money involved (I'm talking about ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"") and now he proved he can create an interesting and exciting flick in other genre. Craven works great, I'm sure he'd shoot an awesome love story if he has to.
""Red Eye"" is everything a good thriller should be - it's intense and gripping, it's surprising and very well crafted. The moment when you realise what's going on is done so perfect, I felt shivers down my spine.
The casting is just outstanding, and that's another Craven's merit. The film could have done much more worse with big stars, so Craven took rather well-known actors, but not THAT big. Rachel McAdams is very pretty on one hand, on the other she can really act, and you feel some inner strength in her. Cillian Murphy is just beyond any praise, I sincerely think this guy has a tremendous future as an actor.

The theme of a global paranoia, that anyone anywhere could suddenly be ensnared in a deep dark plot, is the basis of Hitchcock's career.  This is not a theme of Craven's 'work', which occasionally has risen to classic status.

There is little left undone here, no loose threads, as there is not only no time in this film for meandering, but McAdams is able to play her otherwise bland role (a hotel manager, how exciting) to perfection.

Like the film that followed it, ""Flightplan"" with Jodie Foster, ""Red Eye"" pits a resourceful hero (Rachel McAdams) against foul villainy in a plane at 30,000 feet. A little girl, a helpful man and flight attendants play pivotal parts in both pictures. And both women ultimately triumph combining superior intelligence with physical prowess. Foster knows her way around a psychological thriller, but for Craven, principal of Slasher High, this is new territory.

His fluid camera, relentless pace and acute take on the genre pay off in performance, even in the supporting roles. Boyish Irish actor Cillian Murphy has a dreamy jawline and is charming until his close-up (those chill blue eyes.) McAdams looks lovely but too young to be managing a luxury hotel. No matter; both nail their characters with economy and suspend any disbelief. Seasoned pro Brian Cox, as her father, comes to the rescue.

Wes Craven is perhaps known for cheesy teenage type movies, and while this is definitely in his character it was pretty entertaining and it was enough for me and my boyfriend, who liked it even more than me, to sit back and watch it and then to agree that we both liked it.

Rachel McAdams was genuine, fresh and pretty: she conveyed many emotions with her face and tear streaked eyes, as Cyclops like with his polarizing blue eyes Cillian Murphy went from a friendly fellow passenger to a heartless man who held her and her fathers future in his palm. He knew how she liked her eggs cooked at 3 am, who broke her heart, what her father watched on TV and where she lived, as he knew exactly how to control this one person in order to carry out a grander evil plan.

Since there are only so many things that she could do on the plane, it's up to her wit and personal strength to try and save the day. She doesn't give up, while we did watch her fail in many attempts, and how Murphy made her pay for it, it was a great movie.

2442894,3,B000BVM1SC,"As much as people complain about Hollywood dumbing down its films, it has become harder and harder to find a straightforward movie at the multiplex. If a film isn't laden with at least one (un)predictable 180 degree plot twist, it is simply far too long, with many presuming they are worth more than two hours of my precious time.

It should come as no plot twist that I found Wes Craven's Red Eye deeply enjoyable, if only in the ways that an efficient thriller should be. In a year where I avoided the supposedly fantastic King Kong over fears of its length, Red Eye weighs in at under 80 minutes, if you don't count the credits. Directors should take note; simplicity is effective.

Red Eye begins with hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) heading to the airport. Waiting for the delayed plane, she meets Jack Rippner (Cillian Murphy), a uneasily charming fellow passenger who just happens to have the seat next to her. As soon as the plane takes off, he casually informs her that his associate will kill her father (Brian Cox) unless she uses her position to change the hotel room of a Homeland Security official. Thus, our hour of terror begins.

Unlike other thrillers of the cat-and-mouse variety, the two leads spend most of the time mere inches away from each other. McAdams plays Lisa as terrified but calm and quick-thinking, a role light years ahead of the stupid Mean Girls or the apocalyptically terrible Wedding Crashers. Murphy is infinitely creepier and more villainous as Rippner than as the Scarecrow in Batman Begins. Rippner isn't omniscient or invulnerable to injury, instead relying on a sharp eye for detail and menace to get what he wants.

Red Eye never degenerates into the jerk-off twists or impossible effects that most contemporary thrillers do. The plot may be ridiculous, but not any more than it has to be. Film fanatics will recognize every cog of the story the second it they are presented, but will be pleasantly surprised at how well they fit together.

Ironically, if the film has any major problem, it may be that it is too efficient. The characters and story move along so briskly and with so few superfluous details that we don't have time to care much for the characters. It is a film teacher's dream, an A+ screenplay transformed into a B-. Red Eye plays all the right notes, but after the climatic battle, I should have been thinking something other than ""Gee, Brian Cox sure has lost a lot of weight.""",1139356800,,2453,4.72196261682243
2442895,4,B000BVM1SC,"Rachel McAdams plays a hotel manager flying back home to Miami after her grandmother's funeral. She meets a man in line and begins a flirtatious conversation. When she boards the plane, it seems serendipity has placed them in seats aside one another. After the plave takes off, however, the man reveals that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate a high ranking government official who just happens to be arriving at the hotel McAdams manages. She is the only one with the authority to change the official's room to the specific one the killers want him in. He also reveals that their is a man sitting outside her father's house. If she doesn't cooperate, her father will be killed. McAdams spends the flight trying to find a way to keep her father alive, but also not comply with the killers.

Red Eye is short compared to most movies these days but is just the right length for a thriller like this. There are no wasted scenes and a lot of talking that doesn't get you anywhere. There is just enough character set-up so you can feel for McAdams and Cillian Murphy does a nice job of underplaying his hitman character. He's nasty enough that you believe he could hurt you, but he doesn't chew the scenery the way some actors would have.

2442898,4,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven's ""Red Eye"" is one of those movies that embraces its simplistic nature, but yet excels beyond the usual cliches because it's more honest about what it wants to do, and also how entertaining this kind of movie can be.

Watching this movie reminded me of ""A History of Violence"", in that this movie begins as one movie, then ends drastically and powefully as another type.  Rachel McAdams is Lisa, a hotel manager who's about to catch the last flight available back to Miami.  Cillian Murphy plays Jack, a charming man who knows all the right words to smooth over, and intimidate, Lisa for his sinister intentions.  I cannot emphasize enough how Murphy and McAdams could've fooled me into thinking I was watching a romance, because Craven is patient with his setup, and the two lead actors bring a sense of conviction and reality to these roles.  Murphy chillingly tells his co-passenger that if she doesn't do what he says, a hitman will murder her father.  After that begins a series of suspenseful set pieces, and some previous exposition that pays off in effective form.

Credit must be given to Craven and his photography department, because this movie is well-shot and well-edited.  You'd think the confines of an airplane would minimalize a director's playbook of camera tricks.  But there are eye-catching tracking shots; and even when the camera isn't moving, one can't help but feel a little claustrophobic and trapped.

What's so cool about this movie is that the actors don't try to overshadow the material, but embody it.  Rachel McAdams does not steal the show with her acting genius; this is a woman who captivates us by revealing how good the story can be, rather than showing off how she redeems a story's faults.  Cillian Murphy really has to be careful about being typecast, but he nevertheless commands our attention with a slithering whisper.  Very rarely does evil take shape in such a cool presence.

Much has been discussed about the ending, and how many viewers are disappointed by it.  I actually like the concept of how this movie concludes, because the somewhat-cliched final act is still thrilling and heart-pounding.  I will agree that the third act of ""Red Eye"" is a little rushed.  This 90-minute fun-flick could've easily been drawn out to a masterful 2-hour film.

""Red Eye"" is a good movie.  Wes Craven finally redeems his directing career by tackling a different kind of project.  ""Red Eye"" was probably never meant to be more than a popcorn thriller, which it likely will be more most viewers.  But for those of us who like a little sophistication in our entertainment, ""Red Eye"" is a well-acted and geniously-shot movie that embraces its conventions and delivers above expectations.

A hotel desk clerk gets finds herself trapped in a deadly situation on what should be a peaceful late night flight. Her charming seat mate at first seems like a possible catch. Things start to get ugly, though, when he turns out not to be what he seems.

This movie has all the clichs: opening a door to find the heavy standing behind it (twice in one movie); foiled attempts to get calls for help out to the people around her; a pursuer for who always manages to be right behind her and know right where she is, etc. Characters quickly become cardboard cutouts of those in every other ""thriller"" you've ever seen.

2442916,5,B000BVM1SC,"Often times in Hollywood, film directors are forced into a rut in terms of the genre of films they direct.  It seems that a lot of times once a director directs a kid-friendly movie, a science fiction movie, or even an action film, that director will be branded that type of director for the remainder of his/her career.  The genre that is most notorious with this effect on director's careers would be the horror movie.  John Carpenter and Wes Craven being the two most popular directors that have always been branded horror directors.  Carpenter with his horror classics, ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"", and ""The Thing"", any time you hear the name John Carpenter you automatically think horror director.  Wes Craven is the same way, thanks in no small part to ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""New Nightmare"", and the 'Scream' trilogy.  However, sometimes there are exceptions to the rule, and a director is able to escape the genre that has been his trademark for years, when this happens you know you'll be in for a unique movie-watching experience.  Because it is with these films that you get a new blend of two genres, the genre the director is most familiar with and whatever genre they are experimenting in for the first time.  Sometimes though it would be best for directors to stick to the genre they're best at; however, this is not the case for Wes Craven.  In 2005, Wes Craven stepped outside of the confines of horror films, and directed a white-knuckle thrill ride, ""Red Eye"", proving to critics and audiences that the difference between horror films and thrillers is merely a walk across the street.

""Red Eye"" takes place over the course of one day and night, when a very successful hotel manager, Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is forced to take the red-eye flight from somewhere in Texas back to her hotel in Miami because of a Homeland Security official who is coming into Miami and is staying in her hotel.  As the flight begins, the person sitting next to Lisa on the flight, a man named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), strikes up a conversation with Lisa that quickly turns from casual to creepy.  Jackson as it turns out is the middle-man in a plot to assassinate the very Homeland Security official that is staying in Lisa's resort, so he and his cohorts have devised a way to force Lisa into arranging everything at her hotel in a way that will leave the government official exposed and easier to assassinate.  As Lisa tries to outwit her apparent stalker, she is shown the one piece of leverage that the would be killers have that will stop Lisa in her tracks, her father will be killed if she will not comply.  Now, Lisa is in the fight for not only her life and the life of a government official, but also her father's.  All she has to rely on are her wits and courage, but will they be enough to save them all.

Stepping outside of one's comfort zone has proved to be true box office gold for Wes Craven.  With incredible young actors Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook"") and Cillian Murphy (""Batman Begins"" and ""28 Days Later""), alongside veteran actor Brian Cox (""Troy"" and ""The Bourne Identity""), fleshing out these characters in this well-written, incredibly tense thrill ride, Wes was sure to hit the bullseye.

Though ""Red Eye"" does have an unusually short running time of around 82 minutes, it's probably the appropriate amount of time.  Since it's so short it allows Craven to constantly keep the atmosphere tense, and hardly allows for any down time for the audience to catch their collective breaths.  Sometimes keeping the intensity so high throughout the duration of a film works against the movie, for ""Red Eye"" it works to its advantage because of the shorter running time, and any sort of lull in the intensity would probably lower the thrill value of the film.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for an intense thrill ride, that will leave you on the edge of your seats for the entire movie.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!

""Red Eye"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1138838400,,4009,4.703862660944206

The movie is about a hotel manager by the name of Lisa (Rachel McAdams) who is flying back to Miami aboard a red eye flight. While she is waiting in line to check into her flight she briefly meets a guy by the name of Jackson (Cillian Murphy) who invites her to have a drink with her at the airport bar. At first she declines his invitation, but later decides to join him. They start having a conversation and it seems like they are getting along great. It is finally time to board the airplane and coincidently they end up sitting next to each other. After the plane takes off soon Lisa finds out that Jackson is not the person she tough he was. He tells her that he needs her to call the hotel where she works so that she can help him get the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, who is a guest at the hotel where Lisa works, killed. Lisa then has to face the fact that she needs to choose between saving her father's life or endangering the life of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security.

2442918,2,B000BVM1SC,"Was this supposed to be a suspense thriller? If so, they really missed the mark with this mess. Let me start by saying the only reason I am giving this vile excuse for cinema two stars is for the acting. McAdams and Murphy did well with what they had to work with. Which only leads me to believe that the only reason they acted in this mess was to pay off a cellphone bill.

The plot was as holey as swiss cheese and there was way too much talking and not enough action in the beginning. The cheap special effects didn't fair well with me either. At one point, they showed the airplane (which was abviously a model airplane) in flight and all I can remember thinking was ""Are they sure they spent 25 Million to make this mess"" ? Oh and they also could have kept that scene where McAdams stabs Murphy in the neck and he merely slaps on a flimsy scarf to conceal the wound. That part was so unrealistic it was laughable.

And although the antagonist's acting was adequate I felt that he was miscast. If he was supposed to be threatening it wasn't believable. Would you be scared of someone that looks to be about 5 pounds bigger than you sporting a Condoleeza Rice-ish hairdo? I think not. Then he was supposed to be a big time killer but spent the last 20 minutes of the movie getting the crap beat out of him by a woman. Umm...no thats just a big mess.

If you ask me a runtime of 84 minutes was too long for this wretched film. I would have rather spent 84 minutes trying to scoop out my left eye with a tablespoon that sit through this unrealistic crap again.

It follows the standard 'thriller/ suspense' formula of heroine facing impossible situation, coming up with a clever way out, and then a showdown with the badguy. The ending in particular is SO formulatic, I guessed EXACTLY what would happen 15 minutes before it happened!!!

  There are a few original elements to the film, though. The 'badguy' is not a formula villian, and the heroine is a very able character, not the typical 'scream helplessly' type you see in most horror movies. This helps the film from becoming a total Hollywood thriller stereotype. In addition, Wes Craven does milk some nice suspense out of the fairly cookie-cutter script.

The trouble is, you are still deceived.  It gives the promise of being a horror film (especially with Craven directing) but it is really a thriller.  It is not a bad thriller, but it is not an especially great thriller either.

Instead of turning out to be her next boyfriend, he turns out to be a terrorist-for-hire, who is forcing her to make a phone call that will help kill a diplomat and his family.  If not, they will murder her father.  Most of the movie is occupied with the plane flight and the battle of wills between them.  Of course, in a concept movie like this, there has to be all sorts of distractions and unlikely happenings in order to give the movie momentum.  In the end, logic breaks down and it devolves into the standard ""knife-weilding-bad-guy-chasing-the-heroin"" picture.  Subtlety has never been one of Wes Craven's strong points.

2442933,2,B000BVM1SC,"On the whole, this is the type of movie that falls somewhere between being mediocre and really bad.  It has a few moments (an unmistakable product of the now common ""the trailer was better than the film itself"" phenomenon that Hollywood execs skillfully employ to keep raking in the bucks), but it is worth a full watch just for the performance of Cillian Murphy, who may be our next Christopher Walken if he makes the right career decisions.  So far his talent has been wasted on self-addressed directorial loveletters like Sandra Bullock's ""Murder By Numbers"" and  pointless spots in crapfests like ""The Village"", but it seems he is smartening up: his performance as Scarecrow in ""Batman Begins"" left no doubt as to his psychopathic potential.

He almost saves this bungled psychodrama which degenerates into an unredeemable mess after his character Jackson Rippner (gee, wonder who that's a reference to Wes) boards the plane with the stomach churningly ""heroic"" Rachel McAdams.  Her character was so sweet, so together, so plain wonderful that I wanted to throw up.  But even his shark-eyed charisma can't bear the weight of the script and Craven's insistence on always being goofy.  I wonder if he's aware of this or not: he has become such a joke that maybe he knows no one will ever take him seriously again, hence the self-degradation-via-failed-camp in movie after movie.

That said, Murphy running around like the velvet menace with the hole in his throat and an unstoppable fury makes it worth enduring.  This is an odd Irishman with a lot of potential for being an actor we won't forget, if he sticks with films like ""Begins"" and ""28 Days Later"".

The two leads are fine, Rachel McAdams, who is everywhere these days, plays Lisa. McAdams is very pretty and a decent actress, she played this well, but the script really didn't let her do much. Most of the credit goes to Cillian Murphy (If you remember he was the scarecrow in Batman Begins, another yawn inducer) I liked that he played this evil character with a slight human side, not all terrifying and cold like we usually see. But, even his cool performance couldn't save this from being just boring and not very suspensefull.

I found it really hard to believe that this movie could waste the talent of one of Hollywood's most under-rated and one of my personal favorite actors, Brian Cox. This man always brings it to his roles, specially when he plays a baddie. But this time he plays Lisa's dad and had very few scenes, and worse yet, the few he was in were weak and pointless. If you ever want to really enjoy Brian Cox, I strongly, strongly recommend an X-Box game called Manhunt, he does the voice for Starkweather, a real low human being, it's mesmerizing, I swear.

The plot revolves around Lisa taking a Red-Eye flight to get home after the funeral of her grandmother only to be sitting next to a  highly intelligent, yet very dangerous 'hitman'. Seems he was hired to kill the head of Homeland Security, who just happens to be staying at the hotel Lisa is a manager of. If she does not help him, he will have his partner kill her dad as he is stationed just outside his house sitting in a parked BMW. Of course she attempts to let someone on the plane secretly know what's going on, but Murphy catches her everytime. This all leads to a very poor ending with no suspense build-up at all.

I love and own almost every single Wes Craven title, I think the first Scream and the Nightmare series are some of the finest horror movies ever, but I will not buy this, and I know it did fairly decent at the box-office (58 million for a horror movie is pretty good) But I hope Craven is not planning a sequel, like he usually does. Maybe we could get a sequel to Cursed, which was a far better horror movie then Red Eye. Upon returning this and Serenity, I rented Venom and Transporter 2, so I'll see all of ya real soon..........

Moments after takeoff, Jackson drops his act and reveals himself as a man who is involved in a plan to kill the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, and it's Lisa who must set the plan into action... or else her father will be murdered. And at 30,000 feet, there's no where to run and nowhere to get help.

This is where Craven's film really takes flight (so to speak), becoming a gripping and edgy claustrophobic suspense thriller in the mould of Hitchcock, while making perceptive use of intruding close up shots to penetrate the audience deep within the heroine's estranged predicament. Told she must make an air phone call in order to move a political figure closer to death's door, or else her Father will be appropriately bumped off, Rachel frustrates in her attempts to play Rippner at his own game. Whilst on board there's a comical array of Airport type passengers who unintentionally complicate Rippner's decadent ploy: stand outs include a voluptuous middle aged women, who constantly seeks Rippner's assistance with her overhead luggage, a friendly but interfering old lady, (reminiscent of Helen Hayes in ""Airport 1970"") and a resourceful beady-eyed child on her first flight.  But its Cillian Murphy's slanderous turn as Rippner - his unusually chiseled features and watery blue eyes used at first to charm, then terrorize Rachel in a sadistic turn of malevolence - that dominates the screen with a cool and creeping exterior presence. McAdams also fairs well in the resourceful heroine role, forced to flex her action muscles once the ball slides into her court, while successfully anchoring the film into believability with her homely emanation.

Once the pivotal flight sequence is over however Craven is on disappointingly familiar stalk and slash territory, as Rachel proceeds to run from a now vocally impaired Rippner, (metaphorically morphed into a monstrous persona -a sly nod to Craven's Freddy Kruger creation), with the film beginning to lose some of its momentum following a predictable array of genre cliques, which finds Rachel becoming trapped inside her family home armed with hockey stick, with the sinister Rippner lurking around somewhere in typical psycho killer defiance.  On the whole ""Red Eye"" remains an engrossing if routine thriller, which should banish memories of Craven's recent disastrous werewolf outing ""Cursed"", while keeping you buckled to your seat with high-octane tension.  Craven is obviously starting to get away from his teeny-bopping, ""let's make the big bucks"" thrillers (""Scream"","" Cursed"") and has decided to lean toward films that made him famous in the first place (""The Hills Have Eyes"","" A Nightmare on Elm Street"") with ""Red Eye"".  Although it lacks characterization and has some plot mishaps, it is a deadly serious thriller that doesn't have tongue-in-cheek humor or cater to pre-teen audiences-it's goal is to just flat out scare you with its shocking (used very loosely here) twists and intense reality and while it only moderately succeeds in these departments, at least it was an adequate effort back into the realm of serious thrills and chills.",1138406400,,4073,5.114457831325301
2442938,4,B000BVM1SC,"In 'Red Eye', we have Cillian Murphy starring as a Seemingly-Nice-Ne'er-Do-Well, alongside newbie Rachel McAdams' surprisingly fluid portrayal of an anally retentive hotel manageress, whose devotion to her job and her father make her the ideal scapegoat for a team of assassins intent on ending the life of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. With Wes Craven taking the directorial helm, one could be forgiven for writing this off as an obvious and unrewarding cash-in on the new paranoia surrounding airline travel - but, surprisingly enough, Craven, alongside the excellent pairing of Murphy and McAdam, has managed to craft a tight, tense and wholly captivating thriller out of what could so easily have been 'Flight Plan's poor cousin.

Cillian Murphy is just like Johnathan Rhys-Myers; he's Irish, he's beautiful, he's great at accents, and he's able to turn on a dime from hero to villain. There's one major difference between Murphy and Rhys-Myers, though: Murphy has talent, he can act. He makes for a compelling villain here - the script offers no explanation for the actions of his would-be terrorist character Jackson Rippner, but Murphy's superior characterisation skills make for an enigmatic and menacing sort of villain. McAdams as the hapless-yet-plucky heroine Lisa Reisert is excellent - for a new star, she certainly displays a wealth of talent that belies her relatively scant experience. Sympathetic, energetic and totally watchable, I'm very interested to see just how the next few years of her career turn out - if this movie is anything to go by, she, like Murphy, seems to be headed for great things.

Wes Craven is something of a revelation behind the camera here - personally, I haven't seen him do anything really original or standout since 1996's 'Scream' - but his fast pacing and skillful management of the action scenes make 'Red Eye' a definite success. There's a real sense of claustrophobia in the on-board turbulence and take-off sequences, and the penultimate scenes at the hotel and at Reisert's home are totally compelling. Not in the same league as ""Fatal Attraction"", perhaps, but top-notch stuff nonetheless.

All in all, 'Red Eye' is a great movie, and does what any good action thriller ought to do: it's fun, fast and riveting, and is a very definite recommendation.",1138320000,,2318,5.126984126984127
2442939,2,B000BVM1SC,"Ok, I'm gonna be live-blogging this one.
7:29 PM I got my beer (Murphy's Irish Stout) and pizza (homemade, mushroom and pastrami toppings) and I'm upstairs watching the movie on my laptop...
7:31 Ok, there's lots of ominous music, though all that's happening is a guy has dropped his keys and wallet on a table and he's gone inno the bathroom to take a cr@p.  Very spooky.  Oh, wait, somebody's swiped his wallet.  Apparently a guy was waiting in the closet or something and now he's swiped the dude's wallet.  A person isn't safe.
7:37 Ok, I'm about 5 minutes in and I already hate all of the characters.  The main character seems to be a young woman who talks on the cell phone alot.  In other words she is a very unusual young lady.  She tries to look fetching while on the phone, listening with glossy, parted lips and a vacant look in her eyes.  She seems interchangeable with any number of vacuous young women.
7:46  Ok, she's just met up with a young ""man.""  He is irritatingly smarmy from word ""go.""  He insinuates himself gracelessly into her life, saying, ""You'll have a drink if I can guess your drink.""  He then goes on to say, ""I'm feeling... vodka.""  Any young woman who thinks this guy has any substance deserves all she gets.
7:52 Ok, these people are all garbage.  Everyone in the movie is a piece of garbage.  Translation: the writer's a piece of garbage.  The ""Deputy Director of Homeland Security"" is on TV.  He's saying, ""Don't get me wrong, I believe diplomacy can work, but first you have to have their attention.""  I would imagine directing foreign policy is a little out of the purview of the Deputy Director of Homeland Security.  But I guess we're not supposed to notice.  We're supposed to furrow our brow and say to ourselves, ""Political, eh?""  Then we're supposed to feel real sophisticated, ready for the next adult happening in the film.
8:05 Ok, the ""plane"" is taking off and what you see is a computer graphic of a plane instead of a real plane.  They spared no expense on this one.  Over and out.
8:52 Ok, post script: the problem with this movie is you don't care about any of the characters.  You don't care if the main character's dad gets killed.  You don't care if the Sub Regulator of Fatherland Purity gets killed.  You just don't care.  In fact, you want them all to die.
10:24 Ok, back watching this turkey.  Right now the secret service, which seems to be composed of guys in their mid twenties, is ""clearing"" the hotel room that the Deputy Inspector of Hometown Integrity and his used-up trophy wife and ridiculously angelic children are about to occupy.  The lead agent, maybe twenty six years old, says, ""Clear the room"" and next you see a guy in a suit waving a little metal box with knobs and lights on it over a glass vase.  Its unclear what this device is supposed to be detecting... if the room is bugged?  If the vase is made of C4?  You're just supposed to be uncritically letting all this wash over you as you noisily slurp from your giant soda and think about pretending to stretch and then letting your arm fall on the shoulder of your date.  You're not supposed to be wondering how exactly this activity you are witnessing constitutes ""clearing the room."" THEN one of the other agents looks from the penthouse balcony over the ocean through binoculars and sees a lone yacht about a mile away.  He calls this to the attention of the lead agent who says, ""Call it in.""  I see.  So the vicinity of the hotel is now restricted air land and sea space?  Like if there's a fat guy about to go off the diving board... ""Call him in.""  I'm REALLY rooting for the assassins at this point.
11:06 Ok, done.  Very depressed.  Movie absolutely ludicrous.  Night shot to hell.  IT seems as though the film-makers are counting on the viewer hoping Dad doesn't get killed and the Vice Secretary of Homeland Infiltration doesn't get assassinated because.... we cherish human life?  It is taken for granted that we think the dude is right as rain, and ditto for dear old dad who seems to do nothing other than sleep in his chair.
1:00 PM, next day: Lemme see if I got this right: the fiendishly clever plan is as follows: waylay a girl who works behind the desk in a hotel, threaten her with her father being killed if she doesn't move the target to a different room, then some guys in a boat retrieve a bazooka from the ocean floor with a fishing pole and blow the room sky high, all for the purpose of offing this ""politico""?  This plan really stinks.  Ever hear of the KISS principle?  All you need is one guy with a sniper rifle.  He puts a bullet through this A-hole's head and... pack your bags fellas, war's over.  What's that you say?  These ""secret service"" guys are muy professional and they'll totally detect los sniper?  That's nonsense.  Just think of the number of locations our man could be in, the hundreds of office buildings, etc etc.  Besides, if that's not dramatic enough for the Hollywood fast set who know so much about warfare, why don't our assassins just show up in a helicopter armed with miniguns and process the dude to the tune of 4,000 7.62mm rounds a minute?  That's good viewing.  I'd pay double admission just to watch 10 minutes of slo-mo of the dude getting hosed down.  In fact, I will personally volunteer to direct the mission to kill this fictional character.  Just give me a minigun-equipped little bird and I will be inbound hot.  To paraphrase Tennyson, The dude will be at the quiet limit of the world... and the joyless end of the minigun.  Or how bout they just take out the motorcade with some LARS rockets?  What's that you say?  The motorcade is composed of ""armored Escalades??!?""  Ohhh, I'm scared.  You think the screenwriter would like to take a direct bazooka hit while sitting in an ""armored Escalade""?",1138320000,2,5796,4.52504816955684

But what makes this a movie that I will eventually buy instead of just rent is the gag or joke section in the special features.

2.  The passenger who started singing(and got everyone else to go along) during a filming of turbulence.  They were violently rocking from side to side, and you hear a voice start singing the gospel song---""Swing low, sweet chariot--comin' fore to carry me home!""

2442942,4,B000BVM1SC,"Cillian Murphy does good ""bad guy"". Rachel McAdams does good ""smart girl in peril"".

As I watched this film, I was reminded of Hitchcock and ""Dial M for Murder"". I think the two films are very much alike in a couple of ways, not in all.

First of all, McAdams is not a weak woman, whereas Grace Kelly's character was. However, both are women who are wooed by unscrupulous men and fall for it.

Second, Cillian Murphy is a charming pretty boy who turns on a dime to become one heck of an evil guy. Ray Milland is a charming guy who turns out to be evil too.

Finally, the movie does Hitchcock proud. It sets us up for the events to come by letting us believe that we are witnessing one thing, only to turn everything all around and mix it up.

Wes Craven, the film's director, is NOT known for subtlety, which is why this film is all the more interesting. Craven actually takes his time developing his characters and delivers a sinister plotline with care and timing. His previous films have been horror and gorefest films that were as subtle as a sledge hammer.

Craven does a darned good Hitchcock imitation. Murphy and McAdams deliver darned good performances.

Personal note that has nothing to do with the review: McAdams and Murphy are not Kelly or Milland and Craven is not Hitchcock. Somehow, Milland and Kelly managed to provide a depth of character that this film's stars don't quite deliver. I don't know how to put my finger on it, and it's really not so much a criticism of this film as it is a yearning for the the actors of the 30's through the 50's. They just did it a bit better, in my opinion. Watching Dial M for Murder, you can just see the wheels turning in the people's heads as they think through what has gone before. Also there was just a higher degree of terror when Kelly is attacked. Was it Hitchcock's direction or the actors or was it both? I don't know how to discern that. Regardless, there is no one out there today that can do a real thriller like this very well. Craven has done a stand up job and I think this film warrants four stars.",1138060800,,2070,4.347150259067358
2442953,4,B000BVM1SC,"Completing my Rachel McAdams weekend was the in the air thriller Red Eye which was just a slight departure from the other film of hers I saw this weekend, Wedding Crashers. In Red Eye, McAdams is a manager at a prestigious hotel who is returning home from her grandmother's funeral. But back at her hotel, they are preparing for the arrival of the head of Homeland Security with McAdams' replacement who really doesn't seem ready for the extra responsibility and brings some good comic relief to a very tense movie.

Playing the antagonist to McAdams is Cillian Murphy last scene in Batman Begins as the disappointing Scarecrow, granted that wasn't really his fault as the screenwriters had him as Dr. Crane more than the Scarecrow. But Anyways. Red Eye is really a two person movie with the rest of the cast getting very little screen time but be sure to be on the look out for Beaver Casablancas as Headphones Kid Brother and Colby of Survivor fame as Keefe's Head Bodyguard and try not to laugh went he makes his hand singles.

Spending most of the time on just the two main characters has its drawback because the lack of screen time to the two people the terrorist are targeting we don't have enough time to have empathy for them if fact the head Homeland Security comes across as callous early in the film when he is seen giving a speech on a new channel. Plus we never learn why the group was targeting him either. I don't know why they had Murphy use an American accent when his natural Irish accent would have made more sense. And there is something to say about a movie named Red Eye that doesn't get exciting until the plane lands.

But even with all those complaints, a lot of credit goes to McAdams and Murphy for being able to hold the interest during the flight when not much could happen. It was just great watching McAdams' expression change when she realized that the charming guy she just happened to meet in the airport and was seated next to wasn't lying when he says he job deals with nation overthrows and high profile assassinations. Credit should also go to director Wes Craven who camera work is able to keep us on the edge of our seats. Also it was good how, like many movies of this type with a meek female protagonist, McAdams doesn't turn into Buffy the Vampire Slayer all of the sudden and everything she does in the film is very believable for her character.",1137974400,,2390,4.515011547344111

The story was differnt from what I have seen before, and the acting was simply put-great!  I was hooked on this movie until all the way to the end.  Spoiler!  I also liked the fact that the female lead character did not act like a typical feamales depicted in the movies.  NO, she stood up to the bad guy, and even put in few puches, which I could not help but cheered her on.

Another thing I liked about this movie was, it had people that I have never seen before.  I am so sick and tired of seeing the same actors and actresses like, Brad Pitt, Angie Jollie, Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lopez, Katherine Zetta Jones, Julia Roberts, Colin Farrell, Nick and Jessica Simpson, Pam Anderson, that lady who was in Crouching Tiger Hidden Drage and the House of Daggers, etc.  I cannot understand why so many directos keeps using the same actors and actresses over and over again.  Why can't we see some new faces in movies.  No wonder less and less people are flocking to the movie theaters anymore.  Then again, I'm not one of those people who purchases People magazine, Stars or National Enquirer, etc.  I don't understand why people talke so much about so called ""stars"" and so called ""super modles"", and buy magazines with them in it.  Don't people have a life?  I know so many people who knows so much about ""stars"" and ""super modles"" personal lives, that I actually pitty them.  Can't people find things interesting in their own lives, instead of rely totally on Hollywood movie stars or super modles?  I hope that more and more movie directors and t.v. producers would put more and more new faces in their movies and t.v.

It is about the same as an episode of 24 or Lost.

The trailers for this movie are misleading.  They make it appear as if the heroine starts a love affair with a man who later turns out to be evil.  But, in the movie, this guy is bad and creepy from the start.

The movie starts out with an introduction of the heroine, her job and her family.  That takes about 15 minutes.  Then there is 15 minutes of being stuck in the airport and trying to catch a flight.  It isn't until 30 minutes into the movie that the heroine is first put into danger.

There's nothing brilliantly new here, but it was refreshing to see a movie that was born to manipulate the audience with slick twists and real reactions than try for cheap scares or, worse, take itself too seriously. Even though you know the outcome as soon as the plot is born, the fun of these movies is in the ""yeah, but how are they going to beat the psycho, and who has to die along the way?""

The leads are great. This movie will have a long shelf life because it never takes the easy way out. I personally hope this is a career change for Craven and that he ditches shlock like ""Cursed""!

What made it so brilliant was its Hitchcockian gimmick--the movie was an extremely tight, claustrophobic thriller. Really frightening and fun. All the action was confined to two little airplane seats.

Then, all the sudden...what's this? they're getting off the plane? Well, trust me, you should leave too, because from this point on the movie turns into a pile of idiotic action/spy movie cliches.

What happened here? Did Craven lose confidence in his movie halfway through filming and decide to go for the cheap thrills? I don't need to see planes flying into buildings and people being run over and enormous explosions to have a good time at the movies, it's quite the reverse.

I'm only 15 and even I realize what a cop-out the last act of this movie was. And don't even get me started about the ending...It's a shame, it had the potential to be a great movie. It averages out to just be a watchable one.",1137542400,,1107,4.810526315789474

Yet RED EYE is precisely that.  This a tight conversational duet for two actors with accompaniment that slips up on the viewer so surely that the terrifying climax is somewhat of a relief from the preceding tension.

Rachael McAdams as the heroine proves she can sustain a fine character development from first appearance through the suspense to the last screen frame.  Likewise, Cillian Murphy uses not only his talent as an actor but also his clear blue-eyed innocence to foreshadow the evil underneath.  Since the majority of the film takes place aboard an airplane in flight (the red eye from Texas to Miami), the tension for the story rests heavily with these two actors.  They succeed in every way, as does Craven in turning his directorial skills to intellectual rather than physical terror.  Well done! Grady Harp, January 06",1137456000,8,985,5.04320987654321
2442977,5,B000BVM1SC,"When I first watched Red Eye I thought it was just all right, mainly because I wasn't paying too much attention to it throughout. But I liked it enough to buy it and when I did again watch it one night I was blown away by how much more entertaining it was than I gave credit for.

Almost right away the movie dives into the plot. Cillian Murphy's character cuts right to the chase about what he wants McAdam's character to do and from then it turns into a fast- paced and satisfying thrill of a ride that doesn't end till the credits.

Cillian is just an amazing actor and was perfect for his role and McAdams was great with him. Their dialogue together throughout the films keeps you interested and the ending, although predictable, is also satisfying. The entire movie is short but rather exciting, with two talented actors that fit their roles like a glove, and the plot itself carries well.

Overall highly recommended. One of my favorites to watch. 5/5",1137369600,,957,4.520231213872832
2442978,2,B000BVM1SC,"The only reason, and I do mean the 'only' reason to watch this ridiculous film, is the standout performance given by Rachel McAdams.  She shows some incredible range of emotion from helplessness to defiance and I was immediately enamored with her talent as well as her beauty.  Director Wes Craven, know primarily for his groundbreaking work in the horror film genre, takes a day off to try his hand at suspense, Hitchcock-style.  The pace of the film is speedy and sometimes distracted me from the fact I didn't care what was going on, but in retrospect this turns into an incredibly dumb movie.  Nobody here could save a script that starts off promising but eventually veers off onto the shoulder then crashes into a large oak tree.  The plotting goes down far too familiar roads, and I often felt bad for Rachel McAdams trapped inside this predictable story.  She is the saving grace that keeps me from throttling this film down to a 1-star rating.  The more characters that become involved in the plot, the more convoluted the plot becomes.  Early on in the story there are just two characters in an intense situation that may or may not be true.  Perhaps there is a hidden agenda?  The beginning is ripe with possibilities.  But as all is eventually revealed the whole mess becomes just plain ripe.  This movie stinks.  With any other actress in the lead role I am certain I would not have even bothered to finish watching the film at all.  However, keep an eye out for Rachel McAdams.  She is a starlet on the rise.",1137369600,,1521,4.623134328358209

I say this because the movie is about 90% dialogue between the two of them, especially in the first half-hour or so, and to not have such good actors at the helm could've spelled disaster for this film. It is surprisingly short (about 1 hour and 20 minutes or so), and on top of that moves along very quickly. The script is very good, and you enjoy yourself watching this movie.

Let's get right to the main course of this movie.  The villain ""Jack Rippner"" is the most incompetent criminal one could ever imagine.  This guy could not even manage to rip himself off.  In my opinion, the ""bad"" guy of this film is a complete embarassment to the crime industry.  From the first moment he communicated his demands to Rachel McAdams on the plane, like a blundering nincompoop, he committed one foolish mistake after another and for some reason was never once able to deliver on his word.

And why, after the ten minute cat and mouse game at the end, does Brian Cox have to save the day? The whole movie was about setting up how cunning and resourceful Rachel is. So why can't she off the bad guy herself?

2442997,5,B000BVM1SC,"I think Wes Craven is a good filmmaker.  However, I would only consider myself a fan of two or three of his films.  Other than A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream, Craven has stuck mostly to cheaper films, that don't scare as well.  Such as Cursed and Vampire in Brooklyn.

However, I was still excited to see Red Eye when I found out that Craven was directing.  Also, the teaser trailer that was first shown did an amazing job.  You thought the whole time you were about to see a preview for a romantic comedy, but then the music and look changed and all you were given was the title and some catch phrases, with no plot revelation whatsoever.  From the moment I saw that trailer, I wanted to see Red Eye.

The movie itself is very, very good.  Not just plot-wise, either.  This thriller is brilliantly acted, directed, and (most importantly) paced.  Just about anyone can agree that most thrillers are dragged out to around 2 hours or more trying to make the story more in-depth when they are really just boring the viewer (Constant Gardener, anyone?)  Red Eye does no such thing.  At a brisk 80 minutes, Red Eye gets straight to the point and never lets the viewer go once the thrills have started.

Basic plot overview: Lisa Reisert is the manager of a luxury hotel in Miami, where a new Homeland Security official is a regular.  On her way back to Miami from Dallas (grandmother's death) she encounters Jackson Rippner at the airport and, after a drink, finds him sitting next to her on the plane.  Once takeoff is over, Jackson reveals himself as a ""manager"" who wants Lisa to call her hotel and change the official's room number when he arrives at the hotel.

What unfolds after that point is a thrilling, entertaining cat-and-mouse between Lisa and Jackson on the plane.  The confined atmosphere of the airplane cabin really adds a good element to the film, as well.  Craven uses mostly close-up, intense shots of the characters, so the viewer can really feel like they are right there, experiencing everything along with Lisa.

Rachel McAdams does a good job of playing a vulnerable, but yet strong-willed woman who is not willing to give up control of herself for any reason.  Cillian Murphy plays his second straight awesome villain (after Batman Begins) and does a great job of exuding a calm, inviting presence before the flight, and an intense, professional, brutal personality once he gets down to business.

A great psychological thriller with great performances, and a couple of good action sequences near the end, Red Eye makes good viewing for any Friday night.",1137196800,2,2581,4.701559020044543

There is a definite chemistry between the two and the adversial nature of their relationship is combustible.

2443001,4,B000BVM1SC,"No, this movie isn't about some horrible bacterial scourage related to ""Pink Eye"". This tidy little thriller from director Wes Craven (""Scream"") will make you realize that wading through the bodies at security isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) juggles her responsibility as a manager at a Miami hotel with...nothing else. She IS her job. She doesn't have a social life and she's not sure that she wants one right now. Returning from the funeral of her grandfather in Texas Lisa finds herself trapped with Jackson (Cillian Murphy in a wonderfully creepy performance) an assassin who blackmails Rachel into helping him murder the new head of Homeland Security. Through 85 nail-biting minutes we travel with these two as Lisa tries and to figure out a way to warn those around her about Jackson and his plan.

Featuring taunt no nonsense direction from Craven, ""Red Eye"" is the type of thriller that Hitchcock might have made if he were alive. The only thing missing is the blond hair for his heroine. The screenplay by TV writer Carl Ellsworth (""Cleopatra 2525"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") pulls out all the stops to milk the suspense for all its worth. In fact ""Red Eye"" would probably have worked almost as well on the small screen except for the annoying interruption of commercials. Filmed on a paltry $25 million budget ""Red Eye"" proves that the best film making comes not from outrageously large budgets and CGI effects but from a well written script, strong direction and two appealing leads. Make no mistake this isn't ""Vertigo"" nor is it ""Munich"" but Craven's film falls into the ""entertainments"" such as ""North by Northwest"" that Hitchcock made.

Luckily watching ""Red Eye"" won't leave you with the bleary looking eyes of someone who has taken an early morning plane trip. The colors are nicely reproduced with natural skin tones. The stormy and menacing lighting adds perfectly to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film and Craven keeps most of his camera work deceptively simple except for one or two memorable exceptions. The film is enhanced for 16x9 TVs so the 2.40:1 aspect ratio shouldn't be a problem for most folks with widescreen TVs.  The stormy soundtrack puts you right in the middle of the turbulent flight that the two main characters are on. Surround speakers are used very effectively throughout most of the film.

As far as extras go they aren't all that spectacular. We get a gag reel that's presented in widescreen (but not in anamorphic widescreen) as well as a couple of featurettes that are so-so. The first ""The Making of `Red Eye'"" is pretty standard fare. The cast, screenwriter, producer and Craven are interviewed about what attracted them to making this thriller. ""Wes Craven: A New Kind of Thriller"" has Craven discussing what attracted him to making the film and how he never intended to be a ""horror"" director just a film director. He mentions this was an attempt to step away from horror although not too far so that he wasn't in completely unfamiliar surroundings. We also get previews which you can skip.

Craven's commentary (there's also participation by Producer Marianne Maddalena and Editor Patrick Lussier) is the most interesting extra here. He mixes on set anecdotes with observations about the film now that it's completed and technical issues he faced during production. It's a solid commentary track well worth listening to after you've watched the film the first time.

""Red Eye"" is an enjoyable B-movie thriller. Craven restrains himself throughout the movie keeping gore to a minimum and focusing on creating a suspenseful film instead. It's not a profound or ambitious movie but it doesn't pretend to be. It's an enjoyable romp that will keep you entertained during its 89 minute running time.",1137110400,2,3797,4.971653543307086

But plausibility problems start simmering early and blow through the roof by the end.  I won't spoil anything, but after a decent setup the wheels completely fall off.  The end of the movie is AWFUL.  We're asked to believe that the heroine is smart but her behavior is utterly stupid at the end.  The smallest degree of common sense would solve everything, but she insists of doing everything the hard way.  To top it off, the conclusion wouldn't be possible if not for Murphy's ability to keep exerting himself despite an injury that would be completely disabling in the real world.  That's fine in a horror movie or a straight action flick, but an ostensibly intelligent suspense film needs a tether to reality.

2443014,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table.  At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen.  We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States.  Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected.  Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on.  If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the ""Halloween"" episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid.  That does not mean that director Wes Craven (""Scream/2/3"") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent.  The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the ""end"" because ""X"" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.

The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell.  At this point many of you will be thinking back to ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence.  Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral.  Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates.  He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.

I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about ""Red Eye.""  Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and ""Batman Begins,"" Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles).  But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists.  Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table.  But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).

The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams.  In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress.  After being the blonde Queen Bee in ""Mean Girls"" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did ""The Notebook.""  Then in 2005 she made ""Red Eye"" in between ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Family Stone.""  She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting.  Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim.  There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.",1137024000,4,3731,4.3895348837209305

2443016,4,B000BVM1SC,"RED EYE serves as sort of a primer on the rising stars of Rachel McAdams (who plays Lisa, the heroine) and Cillian Murphy (the notorious Jack Ripner).  McAdams who has appeared in such varying roles in THE HOT CHICK, THE NOTEBOOK, THE WEDDING CRASHERS and MEAN GIRLS is a very competent young actress.  She milks the role of the damsel in distress to perfection, evoking a sense of terror, determination and guilt.  Murphy who has appeared in COLD MOUNTAIN, 28 DAYS LATER, BATMAN BEGINS and BREAKFAST AT PLUTO's plays the sinister and outright evil villain with a twinkle in those darling blue eyes.  Smoothly moving from the nice guy at the airport into the cold blooded killer seems second nature to Murphy and he's scary!

The movie's plot is rather far-fetched but in this kind of movie, one just sits back and lets the talented director Wes Craven take them on a pretty suspenseful ride.  Fans of SURVIVOR might recognize studly Colby Donaldson as the Defense Secretary's head bodyguard and Jack Scalia is the target of the assassination.  Brian Cox, usually a dynammic presence in any film, doesn't put much into his role as Lisa's father; would have liked to seen a little more passion on his part.

2443018,3,B000BVM1SC,"Ever since noticing Cillian Murphy's piercing blue eyes and devilish good looks, I became interested in seeing Red Eye. My expectations were pretty high considering it is a ""thriller"" that got decent reviews. Usually films that fall into this particular category do not even register on my radar, but this one seemed almost perfect.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, there were many great things about Red Eye. For one thing, it was short and sweet and to the point immediately from the get-go. It didn't spend endless minutes trying to build up uninteresting back stories for the characters. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is...and I appreciate that. Also, Cillian Murphy as Jack Rippner (interesting name, huh?) was captivating...in a charming, beautiful psycho kind of way. Rachel McAdams, who played Lisa, also managed to not fall into the typical female role in these types of movies. She came off very real and strong, and unlike many other actresses that could have played her character, she brought a kind of appeal that was not based on her physical looks alone.

My main problem with this movie is kind of my fault really. Before popping this one into the DVD player, I didn't read the case or anything, so I had my own ideas of what was going to be the plot. I hate to read the case before watching a new movie, but I probably should have this time to avoid the disappointment of finding out that Jack's motive was NOT that he was purely a psychopath, but he was attempting an elaborate plan to asassinate a political figure. Granted, he was still a psychopath, but I would have preferred it if he was just nuts (like Norman Bates in Psycho, for instance). I also would have liked there to have been a little more character development on his side because Cillian Murphy is an intriguing actor and I think he could have used a little more to work with.

The ending of this movie was lackluster for me, too (like many other reviewers have mentioned). It was a letdown, to say the least. It seemed that once they landed and ended up in Lisa's father's house, it became too cliche. Crazed madman chasing desperate heroine through the house until the final confrontation and triumph--haven't seen that before. Plus, Jack was outwitted by Lisa at almost every turn and his demise was pitiful. I had hoped for more from a character I had grown to really like.

Oh well. It's still worth watching and enjoying for its own sake. The simplicity of the plot and the way it unfolds so quickly will keep you enthralled for the most part. I think Cillian Murphy's watery-eyed beauty did it for me.",1136937600,,2625,4.650862068965517

2443031,4,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye is a fast paced suspenseful thriller from the director of the Scream movies, Wes Craven, and starring Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins).

McAdams plays hotel manager Lisa who is on her way to see her father when she meets a mysterious man named Jackson, played brilliantly by Murphy, at the airport right before boarding. While they're on the airplane, Jackson reveals to Lisa that he is plotting to assassinate a homeland security official that is staying at the hotel where Lisa works, and that if she doesn't cooperate with him to move the official to the floor where the killers can get him, her father will die.

The movie's fast action and short running time makes it a successful thriller. And it's definitely McAdams and Murphy that turn this simple film into a worthwhile spectacle.

2443032,3,B000BVM1SC,"I was misled by the trailer that this film was going to be a horror film since it's Wes Craven's work, but it turned out to be more like Before Sunrise meets Flight Plan. Considered that Red Eye doesn't have star powers like Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard, it still managed to be a pretty watchable thriller. Yes, I must admit that I am glad to see Canadian darling actress Rachel McAdams rising beyond her Mean Girls images and playing some heavy-duty emotional and physical scenes opposite Cillian Murphy, the ultimate villian player these days. Murphy is very convincing as the evil and vicious hyjacker. McAdams is very good playing her role which goes from totally confident and in control to becoming terrified and vulnerable. Brian Cox is rather wasted with insignificant role and underexposed as McAdams' father. There's limited amount of special effects and action taken place during this film and it's the headgames between the two leads that makes this film more worthwhile, but the ending is the part that failed to satisfy.",1136851200,2,1038,4.937142857142857
2443033,2,B000BVM1SC,"I saw ""Red Eye"" at the theater, namely because it had Cillian Murphy, and I had just seen ""Batman Begins,"" in which he plays Scarecrow. I figured, any movie with Murphy playing the creepy villain he has played before would be worth seeing.

And Red Eye was an entertaining slice of B-movie type cheese, held together with the performances of its lead actors -- Murphy and Rachel McAdams. (hey, Murphy and McAdams).

The setup was better than the eventual conclusion, but it was a nice two-hour diversion. And if you haven't seen it yet, it's probably worth a rental, not a purchase. The movie doesn't have enough substance/depth to it to warrant a deeper look. There's really nothing you can't grasp on a first viewing, and under greater scrutiny, there's at least one glaring plothole.

2443034,3,B000BVM1SC,"the young actress is one of the most talented young actors and a good news to the movie viewers. she's a very enjoyable image. but there are lot of big holes and bad leaks in this not-bad movie:

1)the scene she carelessly watched directly at the camera didn't delete.

2)there is no immediate response when the young girl reported to the stewardess that a man got into the restroom where a woman was already inside. what kind of training that stewardess really got?

3)the 911 operator and police responding times were both ridiculously long

4)so after the rocket blast, no one questioned her and just took for granted? nobody questioned her why she changed the room? and the victim just came up to her and said 'thanks'?

5)yeah, in order to make the young psycho looked bad, you just casted a young man who looked so obviously like psycho and still made the heroine like to talk to him in the airport? that guy's goofy and spooky face would turn every normal woman right away from him, albeit talking to him, having a drink with him, and didn't try to change seat right away. a terrible casting mistake.

6)did you ever open yourself up and confess so much of your personal life to a stranger, a fellow traveler, just because he coincidentally seated next to you?

there were so many loose ends that just didn't sell, yet the director and the editor simply did nothing and let them go.

How could the bad guys plan the plane delay and what if the Homeland Security person simply refuse to move?  Plus the darn missle nearly knocked out the whole floor.  Seems to me that it didn't need to be that exact room.  I liked the fact that heroine had a steel backbone and didn't need any rescuing.  It's also very scary how both parties were able to escape the airport after landing after she stabbed him in the neck.  9/11 hasn't changed much (which is probably closer to reality than I like think).

2443053,4,B000BVM1SC,"Director Wes Craven, the unanimous `master of ceremonies' for many within the horror genre, started his filmmaking career back in 1971 with the drama Together, dubbed in German and a rare find in the current film market. This is not the sort of hollowed beginning one would expect from the man who would go on to be credited for creating one of the most terrifying movie monsters of all time, Freddy Krueger, and for revitalizing the horror genre itself with his now venerable Scream franchise. Critically and publicly acclaimed work in The Hills Have Eyes, Swamp Thing, and The Nightmare on Elm Street are the types of films which have made him infamous throughout Hollywood. However, for reasons which may never be explained - perhaps out of personal interest, who knows, he has chosen to shift his directing skills away from the slasher flicks which have made him essentially a household name and more toward ordinary dramas. But this is Wes Craven after all. Is anything he has done ever ordinary, let alone normal?

The story for Red Eye is easily discernible, nothing startling enigmatic about it, but director Wes Craven, infamous for breaking with the conventional, takes the concept of aeronautical hostage taking to a whole sinister new level. At first glance the premise is not that entirely incalculable - terrorist henchman takes woman hostage and threatens to kill a loved one unless she cooperates in helping him commit an assassination of a US governmental official, she escapes, and he gives chase. Clear enough, right? As the film progresses, however, it intricately evolves into an impertinent, sophisticated thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. What Steven Spielberg did for sharks and the beach with Jaws Wes Craven and Red Eye will do for airplanes, hands down. There are undoubtedly fears that this film will inadvertently cause people to conjure up harrowing memories of the September 11th hijackings but rest assured that the premise deals secularly with one woman and not the idea of using an airliner for the purposes of committing an act of terrorism. Nonetheless, the concept of a hostage being taken, to the awareness of everyone else on board or not, remains apprehensible. It is far more foreseeable that an individual who has been the victim of a carjacking will be shaken by Red Eye, in which case it would be advisable that such individuals be prepared when viewing this film.

Rachael McAdams is a far cry from what one would characterize as a damsel in distress. Beyond the distinguishable observations that she is indeed a woman trapped within a horrendous situation, essentially caught between a rock and a hard place to be quite frank, McAdam's character breaks with the conventions of a typical Hollywood heroine at around the half-way point in the picture. For the first half of the film it would appear as though she has done everything within her power to draw attention to herself while on the plane so as to be rescued from the clutches of Jackson. Proprietary thinking on the theatrical feminine clich would lead you to assume that she would simply give up, but instead she takes action and fights back. This clear cut break from the conventional role of women in thrillers is a welcome change, although this has been evident in Hollywood for at least the past decade. Not that the `damsel in distress' clich is not without its charms; it is just a relief to see a change in pace for once.

Cillian Murphy, known earlier this summer by audiences for his supporting villain role in Christopher Nolan's smash hit, Batman Begins, evidently has a knack for playing intimidating and deranged individuals onscreen. Murphy's quite demeanor and absorbing personality just within the first few scenes audiences encounter with him make his character trusting and endearing to us. As the atmosphere shifts slowly toward that of the dark side, Jackson puts all his cards on the table and the transformation all the more shocking to us, though to be quite honest this should not have come as a surprise in the least. This is truly a credit to Murphy's brilliantly stark performance. The single tragic flaw evident in his character however is at time, specifically near the end of the movie, he comes off as though he is the `Energizer Bunny' of crazed assassins. Rachael McAdams stabs him in the throat with a pen, which he proceeds in due time to pull out of his throat and simply ties a scarf around the wound, has numerous thrown at him, falls down a flight of stairs, is stabbed with a high-heel shoe, and yet he keeps on coming. After awhile it gets a little tiresome. Luckily daddy steps in and puts a few bullets in him to end his little tirade.

Overall, underneath Red Eye's intelligible and rather conspicuous exterior boils a penetrating, emotional suspense drama that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats till the very end. There is quite a bit to enjoy about Wes Craven's intricate psychological thriller, yet adversely there are certain aspects within the context of the film that help bring the quality of the picture down a notch or two. There is this continuous discussion of terrorists and assassinations and yet there remains so little known about the main motivating force behind all of this. Who are these terrorists? What reason do they have to assassinate the director of Homeland Security other then to show off to the world that they can knock a governmental official who can just as easily be replaced? Presumptively these components were left unanswered by Craven in order to maintain the complexity of the script but they remain nagging questions that deserve at least an explanation. And the other negative connotation this film possesses is the build up of clichs which reaches a breaking point in the storyline just as the picture is in the final stretch to its conclusion. The inclusion of the `low-battery signal on the cell phone just when the hero has evaded her pursuer' trick will likely be the most noticeable and irritating clich for audiences to swallow, but given that this is Wes Craven we are talking about here it should not honestly come as too much of a surprise. With that said though, Red Eye remains a smart, sophisticated thriller on such a level which has not been seen by movie audiences since the bygone days of Alfred Hitchcock. As limited a storyline and as confined as its environmental space is, Red Eye surpasses in intensity within the course of a mere few minutes what it takes a big-budget, marquee star picture an entire hour to do.",1135123200,4,6570,4.842526690391459

She is going back to where she works which is a Hotel in Miami and also to her Father, played by the great Brian Cox (X2: X-Men United, Troy).

Red Eye was a good movie. It has romance, suspense, and action. You didn't know what was going to happen. Both Cillian Murphy (as Jackson Rippner) and Rachel McAdams (as Lisa Reisent) starred in it. Other movies that Rachel has starred in are Mean Girls and The Notebook, and Cillian has a role in Batman Begins.

It all started when Lisa went to the airport and met Jackson, who was standing behind her. Rachel thought Cillian was a good and pleasant guy, but she found out what he was really like on the plane. When they got on the plane it took you a few minutes to figure out what he was really like, and what was going on. All the suspense and action that was going on was exciting. I think you would like it because this movie has so much drama and action. Also, Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams did a wonderful job on acting out their parts.",1129680000,,865,4.300613496932515

2443065,4,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye might defy reality with ideas that border perilously on campy -- an airlines called Fresh Air for instance -- but it knows itself well enough to have its say in 90 minutes and move on.

Our two protagonists face off in the claustrophobic confines of an airliner en-route to Miami. We manage to compress some gripping inflight suspense between a credible hitman sent to assassinate a government official and his family, and his grossly underestimated co-passenger and threat target, a young female executive of the swank Miami hotel where the official will be staying.

I recommend not reading too much of the plot but this private little drama between hunter and prey plays out rather well as the plane careens towards Miami. Sadly, soon as we land, all the twisty onboard suspense culminates into a horribly pat wham-bam climax straight out of the screen writer's fantasy. The film is perhaps partially saved by a taut script, and some well delivered action.

2443067,3,B000BVM1SC,"This scary film was directed by Wes Craven, and had real actors instead of animated characters.  John Risman's wallet is stolen as he packs up the things at his office so he can retire.  His daughter, a manager at a fancy hotel, gets the 'red eye' special -- the last flight out-- attend her grandmother's funeral in Florida.  She was a dynamic 91-yr-old woman whose motto was ""Always look forward.""

Lisa meets a stalker, who calls himself Jackson Ripner, and turns into Jack the Ripper.  He has strange-looking blue 'killer' eyes and a very ugly mouth, a person with an attitute. He has a bad hair style and turns into a monster right before her eyes. It seems that fate has put her beside the thief of her dad's billfold, but fate had nothing to do with it.  He had it all planned and knew of her innate fear of flying.  He terrorizes and roughs her up on the plane with a death threat against her dad.  As fate would have it, life changes and things happen.

He is a part of an assassination plot against an important government man who will be staying at the hotel where she works.  He tells her, ""I do my part and move on.""  He's a hit man and out to kill her and her dad when the explosion does not kill the target.  From a 'fishing' vessel called Rapture, the assassins used a high-powered mechanical device to cause the explosion which looked like the 9/11 disaster in New York.

The Keith family are saved.  Lisa stole a van at the airport and got home just in time to save her dad.  In the end, he is the one who saves her life.  Jack is there to finish that part of the job.  ""You failed, Jack.""  She tells him that he is pathetic.  Such a frantic on-going fight ensues throughout the house and the interior is destroyed.  He was a crazed killer who got his just desserts.

Rachel McAdams looked like a young Ashley Judd, and her addled assistant at the hotel, Cynthia, played by Jayme Mays looked like a young Goldie Hawn.  She could be Kate Hudson's sister, or perhaps it was planned for her to play the dumb blonde type based on Goldie's movie roles.

Jack told her on the plane that ""bad things happen to good people.""  I once sent that book to Lois Keys who had moved to Georgetown, Kentucky, to be near her daughter's family and had a bad neighbor.",1127606400,,2266,4.327790973871734
2443068,4,B000BVM1SC,"I already reviewed this movie a few weeks ago elsewhere, but I will stand by what I tell everyone else; there are worse ways to spend your time at an air conditioned theater, but this isn't it.  Wes Craven films aren't usually my brand of entertainment, but the promotion for this film got me into the theater for the first time since Love Actually.  Okay, we've established I don't go out much and need to get a life.  No, it's not brilliant, but it's entertaining, if just a bit too tidily wrapped up and predictable, and for the price of a Saturday afternoon discount ticket, you can't really complain.

I don't like spoilers unless the movie is old, and even then one has to hesitate.  What I can tell you is that Lisa (Rachel McAdams from The Notebook) and Jackson (Cillian Murphy, a hot Irish newcomer who's actually got quite a body of work behind him) have a chemistry that makes all the shortcomings of this movie click.  One would even think they would get together as a couple if it weren't for the fact that he was threatening the murder of her father if she doesn't call the hotel where she works and have a politician moved from his favorite room to another where he and his family will be assassinated by a bunch of foreigners on a yacht.

This is a fast-paced movie that will keep you from looking at your watch, but it's also a bit too contrived.  As others have said, you may have to suspend your disbelief (Just a few teeny spoilers here):

1.  Why can't the other passengers on the plane hear Jackson threatening Lisa?  Maybe it's just the Dolby surround sound in the theater, but I thought they were loud as Hades.

2.  Why, when Lisa has to wait to get into the bathroom to vomit, does he stand in the middle of the filled up plane for 3 minutes, and the only passenger that thinks it's strange is a 10 year-old girl?

3.  I love it when he attacks her in her own home, pushes her down a flight of stairs and, just as he's coming down to stab her, a gun is handy right there on the floor.  My family always leaves guns laying all over the place too, doesn't everybody's?

Minor grievances aside, I recommend this as a good movie to check out, be it a date or anything else.

2443070,5,B000BVM1SC,"Having heard so much praise for `Red Eye' I finally decided to go with my friends to watch this movie, and after watching it, I was not disappointed one bit!

The story is about Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams), a hotel concierge, who after going to Dallas for her grandmother's funeral is stuck in the airport, because her flight from Texas to Miami is delayed. She runs into a man named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) a number of times at the airport, and they get better acquainted with each other each time. When she finally boards the flight, she finds it an odd coincidence that Jackson is the one sitting right next to her. However, her feelings for him change, when he tells her his true intentions for boarding the flight and sitting next to her.

These days, suspense/thriller movies are becoming harder to understand since the writers want to put an intellectual surreal storyline which makes the audience think a lot (like `Exorcism of Emily Rose', `Skeleton Key'). Not that its a bad idea, since I like those kind of movies, but watching `Red Eye' felt like watching one of those old-fashioned horror movies that doesn't involve you to think that much, but will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. The movie is slow for the first 20 minutes, but it `takes off' once they get on the flight. Even the critics were raving about how good this movie was, which is rare since they are very harsh on movies of this genre.

Coming to the cast, Rachel McAdams acted wonderfully as the terrified Lisa. I have seen her in movies like `The Notebook' and `Mean Girls' and I knew she could act well, but in `Red Eye' she did a great job. Cillian Murphy also did well in playing Jackson Rippner. Wes Craven once again shows that he can be a master filmmaker. Although I did enjoy watching `Cursed', I feel like `Red Eye' really shows off Wes Craven's potential.

If she doesn't comply, her will order her beloved father murdered.  Oh, and of course, the clock is ticking and time is FAST running out.

Upon reflection, it's a pretty silly scenario.  This is the BEST plan these A-1 killers could come up with??!!  But McAdams and Murphy are far too watchable to think about those things while watching the film.  That's what you want from a suspense film...to be able to suspend all disbelief and actually go along with the thrilling proceedings for 90 minutes or so.

McAdams tries several tactics to thwart her tormentor.  Some might say she is a ""spunky"" character, but she has a bit more grit than that.  McAdams makes her very appealing and we root for her immediately...which is important...the film doesn't have time to slowly make us warm to her.  McAdams has a winning smile, intelligent eyes and isn't so outrageously attractive that we hold her at arms length.  Murphy has the important knack of making his eyes go empty of all emotion, which makes him instantly unlikeable.

Brian Cox, one of the finest character actors around, plays the father and he's good in his little part as well.

It doesn't sound like much of a film, does it?  But within its 80+ minutes, you get more heart-quickening moments that your average 2 hour thriller.  It's a small movie that makes the absolute most of its limited resources.  Wes Craven obviously hasn't lost all his skills as a filmmaker.  And he was SO lucky in that his two leads are fast emerging as popular favorites.

Also, since it's PG-13, it's not bad for kids.  A few mild swear words are thrown out, but mostly the rating comes from the intensity of the sparring between these two.  I liked it a fair amount...it won't be remembered as an all-time great, but it's really one of this year's more pleasant surprises.",1127260800,,2895,4.603515625

Great performances by Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls) and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) whose chemistry of screen is undeniable. Red Eye is not a typical Wes Craven film in terms of the horror factor, which doesn't really exist in this non-horror thriller.

Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is a successful manager at a prestigious hotel in Miami, FL. She flies to Dallas, TX, to attend her grandmother's funeral and on the way back she takes the red eye out only to get haunted by cold-blooded villain Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) who tells Lisa that her dad will die if she doesn't help his boss assassinate the Homeland Security head official before the plane lands.

The old man has lost it. A trite, predictable wanna-be scare flick, it does nothing more than bore. What's worse, public reviews compare the foul flick to Hitchcock. What a sad generation of film goers we must be training if this poorly conceived trick flick ranks, in their eyes, with Hitchcock. What's even worse than that, is the scare tactics the trailers and advertising for the film used to promise me the threat of death, danger, and devastation at 35,000 feet and instead, some prissy girl is merely threatened by a smarmy man.

No, it did not have the suspense of a Hitchcock thriller, nor was it was particularly well made, but it was suspenseful and entertaining and well worth the $18 bucks we paid to watch it.  I have to admit, that the first third of the movie was a little slow.  I sunk down into my seat and said to myself, ""Well, here is another remake of airplane."" They had the hero (heroine), the teen-agers, the obnoxious doctor, and the rowdy teenagers.  They had everything but the nun.  But then Craven left these characters behind and the movie took off.

Particularly  appealing was the use of the venerable heroine.  Rachael McAdams does not play the superwoman who can defeat males twice her body weight with a single blow, but a wounded woman who is seemingly at the mercy of a ruthless killer, who at last finds the courage to stand up to those who would take everyone away from her whom she cherishes. If you are looking for a cinematic  masterpiece, Red Eye is probably not your movie, but if you are looking for a white knuckle movie and an enjoyable evening's entertainment, Red Eye is for you.",1126828800,,1135,4.470873786407767

Yes, good does triumph over evil at the end of the day - this is, after all, Hollywood - but only after the viewer is taken on a roller coaster ride of emotions.

A brief synopsis of the film is that there is a complex plot to assassinate the director of Homeland Security while he is visiting Miami.  A key to achieving this end is that his hotel room must be changed from one that is deemed secure to one that the assassins believe they can breach.  To make the room change, the hotel is manager is threatened while returning from Texas to Miami.  She must arrange the change over the phone otherwise her father will be killed.

Director, Wes Carven, whose background is in films of the horror genre, deftly adapts to a more mainstream production.  Indeed, it is Craven's cinematic skill that permits this film to soar above lesser films of the same genre.  Craven shows some skills of a Hitchcock nature particularly, yet subtly, the clever use of music to heighten moments of suspense.

I recommend this film as top quality escapist drama.",1126396800,,1170,4.559808612440191

Then, while waiting for her delayed flight, she meets Jackson Rippner (Murphy).  They have a few drinks in the lounge, and then find themselves sitting next to each other on the plane.

They have hit it off and things are going well for Lisa.  Then she finds out that Jackson is not what he seems, and his ulterior motives are going to make this an awful flight for her.  It seems that he has a task for her to perform, or her dad will pay the price.  Now, trapped on a plane with her dad's life in danger, Lisa must figure a way out of this crisis that could have far reaching consequences.

""Red Eye"" is a fast moving, edge of your seat thriller.  Director Wes Craven keeps ratcheting up the tension until the very end.  Murphy is perfect as the crazed Rippner, especially when all out craziness is required.  McAdams is believeable as the woman who is used to being in control of everything.

Not thinking much of it, you befriend this person, only to find later on that you are both on the same flight and sitting next to each other. It's fate, it seems. However, things go very sour. You find out just why he knew a little too much about you -- it appears he has been following you for the past eight weeks, and he is threatening your father's life in exchange for one phone call. Thing is, this phone call will assist in the murder of a high-profile politician and his family, but, it will spare your beloved father's life. What would you do?

And that's all you need to know about Wes Craven's excellent new thriller, ""Red Eye."" In less than an hour and a half, Craven packs in more action than any overblown blockbuster twice it's length would and more thrills than his last few movies have. This is the comeback Craven has so desperately needed to get his career back on track, especially after the terminally flawed ""Cursed,"" just earlier this year. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, as the main characters in a bare-bones cast, are truly exceptional. Murphy is devlish and convincing as always, while McAdams manages to outdo herself yet again, just like she did in 2004's uber-drama ""The Notebook."" In typical Wes Craven fashion, her character is an exceptionally strong and resourceful female lead and McAdams lives up to the task. As for Craven, his film is a very tightly knit piece. Like mentioned before, it's very brief, but packs a lot of punch in it's time. It's not exactly a horror movie like the intitial previews made it look like, nor is it a ""political thriller"" of any sort with some hidden agenda (although they really could have milked it). Wes Craven proves that he can still make a good film, even with a small cast and a small budget, and (thank God) without Kevin Williamson. In the end, the movie has no outstanding flaws. It moves at a brisk pace and you shouldn't take your eyes off the screen. Every frame seems to advance the story just that much further.

2443084,5,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" has so many plot-holes that, given the oppurtunity, you could fly a cargo carrier through them. But the movie is so much fun that it doesn't matter how big they are. For example, in a scene towards the end of the movie, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) drives recklessly down a freeway attempting to call her father to warn him he is in danger. When her phone dies, Lisa keeps on driving, not bothering to stop to use a pay phone. She gets to her dad's (Brian Cox) house and, after a violent but you-go-girl (the women in the audience were clapping, and a little ten year old with her big sister and friend shouted out ""Yay Regina!"") confrontation with the hit man stationed at the house she runs into the house to tell the father what happens, who seems to already know exactly what's happening. When did Lisa get a chance to call him? Did Scarecrow, the villain from ""Batman Begins"" played by Cillian Murphy, call her dad to warn him that Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) was coming for an early morning visit? Wes Craven, directing his first thriller (unless you think of ""Scream"" as a thriller and not a horror movie), directs the actors very well in the confined five-foot space of the airplane seats. What is dwelled on in the movie is the hesitancy of the passengers around them. An older woman (Angela Paton) that Lisa runs into in the terminal keeps trying to talk to Lisa and highlight parts of a survey that Lisa likes. Jackson does not like this and believes that Lisa is trying to write a message to her and hopefully get help. When Jackson beats Lisa up in an airport lavatory and then comes out after her a flight attendant believes they just joined the Mile High Club and calls them trash, but not before telling them that the airplane is not a hotel room. Other memorable characters include a little girl who unwittingly knows too much about Jackson's plan.

Jackson's plan of course, is very complex. Lisa, a high-powered Miami hotel manager, is flying back to Miami from her grandmothers funeral. Flying out of the Dallas airport, her flight is delayed two-plus hours. She meets Jackson in the airport bar. He buys her a drink and they talk for a while. When the plane finally boards, Lisa finds that her seat is-suprise suprise-right next to Jackson. Even though it is the red-eye flight, and Lisa hopes to get some sleep, she still is enthralled with Jackson. After a minute, Jackson reveals that he has followed Lisa for close to a year. He pipes off Lisa's nightly habits like he is her best friend or husband. He then tells her that is she does not help him kill a wealthy executive named William Keefe (Jack Scalia) he will call his paid assassin from the plane phone and have him stab her father with his hunting knife. By the way, this is a great movie for the kids, almost as appropriate as ""Four Brothers"". Anyway, Jackson makes Lisa call her hotel where her friend and employee Cynthia (Jayma Mays) is working. She switches Keefe's room to a different side of the hotel, and when him and his family arrive they are not happy since their usual room has been pulled away from them because of ""septic trouble"". When the plane lands, Lisa goes back to her fathers house where she begins a fight for her life, her father's, and Keefe.

Mays is a very good actress, and she makes a good firstimpression in her first feature film. Previously she has had bit parts in the gimmicky and all around un-funny HBO show ""The Comeback"" and has had a recurring role in the funny and clever HBO comedy-faux reality show ""Entourage"". What the movie fails in is the presentation of a clear story line. Although that is a big problem, it doesn't really diminish the content of the story. Out of the 25 movies (""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Layer Cake"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Madagascar"", ""Bewitched"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", ""The Longest Yard"", ""War Of The Worlds"", ""Crash"", the IMAX movie ""Mystery Of The Nile"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"", ""Skeleton Key"", ""Red Eye"", ""Valiant"", ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", ""March Of The Penguins"", ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", ""Broken Flowers"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Broken Flowers"", ""Four Brothers"", and ""Transporter 2"") I have seen this summer, ""Red Eye"" is the best thriller. Not in the way it is done or the way it is written, but in the way it shows how an evil person can take advantage of such a nice person. Lisa seems like the kind of person that would bend over backwards for somebody to get something done for them and Jackson's extreme mistreatment and abuse of her seem evil and all around wrong.

2443085,5,B000BVM1SC,"In Red Eye: On a routine flight, because of the potential killing of her father a woman is forced into taking part in a plot to assassinate a homeland security official by a stranger who is a middle man in the plot.

Our blue eyed exquisitely beautiful and sexy leading actress is Canadian Rachel McAdams (from Mean Girls, The Notebook and Wedding Crashers). McAdams is as wonderful ever and truly brings across the idea of a strong female. Her character actually has a backstory of having been raped, and since then she has promised never to be as vulnerable again, thus making her very self-sufficient here. The blue eyed antagonist is Irish actor Cillian Murphy (who you may not recognize from Batman Begins since he was covered in make-up for much of the time as the scarecrow). They are ably supported by various supporting characters that are weaved into the story- these include a frustrated passenger, a flirting blonde woman, a suspicious little girl, a nice old lady (who Star Trek fans may recognize as one of the farm people from the pilot episode of Voyager), Rachel McAdams' character's co-worker Cynthia and her Dad (played by Brian Cox of The Bourne Identity, X-Men 2 and The Bourne Supremacy).

The film is well directed by Wes Craven. In fact there's nothing I can fault with this movie. The acting, writing and directing are all good, the score (from composer Marco Beltrami of the Scream trilogy and Terminator 3) is appropriate and the editing (by Patrick Lussier of the Scream trilogy and Dracula 2000) keeps everything moving at a nice pace. I'd say the movie is just the right length. The tension is maintained throughout and the action isn't overdone- in fact I think Wes Craven does well to restrain himself from going over the top.

Giving this movie 5 stars may be a little generous since I don't think of it as the greatest movie of all time or anything close to that, but it is what it is and it does it well. I can't find anything wrong with this movie at all.",1125878400,,1991,4.63456090651558

Then I saw the name WES CRAVEN come on the screen and I thought OH NO...What's going to happen? Everyone knows beautiful girls never survive in horror films. This thankfully is not a horror film but a thriller. Rachel McAdams is a real cut above your average actress in previous Wes Craven films, that should keep her career soaring and really give Wes Craven something he needs if he intends to make movies that leave a lasting impression in this new millennium. Cillian Murphy is also a real asset to this film.

Five years ago in the year 2000, amid worldwide panic over the unforeseen you might have believed that the most terrifying scream is always the last. However, if you were at all disappointed by Scream 3, and had wondered what had become of Wes Craven's promising Scream trilogy, the wait is over. Wes Craven is back and he'll have you screaming again like you never have before. This is no Scream movie. This is better.

Wes Craven takes one of our greatest fears of the past few years since September 11 2001, and locks us in our seats like a missile. It's then when you the traveller come into focus. Riveted back in your seat you know all Wes has to do is fire, but fear starts to rise and the impulse to grab the arm rest of your seat clouds your better judgement thanks to the before flight drinks you had with a charming young man you wouldn't mind getting to know better. You have no way of escape in such a cramped claustrophobic space as an aeroplane. People are around you, but you've never felt so alone. You better stay calm and savour every breath you take as if it were your last. If only your heart wasn't so taken by a stranger you met in line during your flight being delayed due to terrible weather conditions. Purhaps you wouldn't have felt so flusted and cold and seeking warmth and comfort from someone who's really taken your eye. A young man who had taken your heart earlier and given it wings is now sitting beside you and watching your every move with his heart-stopping piercing blue eyes. You might press your hand desperately against the window of the plane, but this is no act of passionate love making as seen in 1997's 'Titanic'. It could be the last desperate attempt at help, but if you could beat yourself out the only way back to earth is down. You'll have to sit the flight out through to its conclusion or spend the rest of the flight wheezing. You better have a caffein drink handly like Red Eye, because you'll have to keep your wits about you if you're ever going to get through this flight alive...

I can see this film becoming an aeroplane favorite as you travel. Just as 'Phycho' turns everyone off showers with Check in. Relax. Take a Shower. 'What Lies Beneath' has you fearing baths. This movie will have you seeing red like classic films as Terminator and Star Wars. Enjoy your flight everyone. Get to know the person beside you well and become really close. You could be seeing so much of them, the only option could be termination. Be careful at the terminal. Fear really does take flight and with Wes Craven as your captain, you never know where you're going to end up.

Purhaps 2005 is the year we must fear most of all. With J.J. Abrams TV hit Lost, as a prime example of intelligent, but always limitless possibilities anything is really possible if you watch closely.",1125792000,,3485,4.4834645669291335

The plot is thin excuse for the preposterous events in the film to happen and the political sub-plot is so vague and transparent it almost isn't even there. See if you can swallow this. Some hit-man (Cillian Murphy), part of a larger group, wants to convince a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) to have a VIP move to another suite so he can fire a rocket at him from the ocean that the suite faces. He does this by cornering her on a late night flight (the 'Red Eye') with the threat of one of his henchmen parked outside her unaware dad's (the brilliant Brian Cox) house waiting to kill him if she does not comply. It's very pointlessly contrived. Why do they not just aim at the VIP from a different position and take him out from his original room rather than stalking and planning to scare a hotel manager for 8 weeks?

Sixty minutes of this eighty-five minute film are spent on so-called 'mind games' with McAdams and Murphy trying to outwit each other on the plane. It's not thrilling and Craven fails to add any sense of hard edge or unbearable tension to it. McAdams and Murphy give half-hearted performances, totally aware that they are starring in a generic, mundane film. Brian Cox is completely and utterly wasted in a thankless role that requires him to do no more than sit around in a living room speaking single-word lines of dialogue. I can only assume he had a credit card bill to pay off that starring in this bore would settle.

The subtext of the oppressed McAdams fighting back against Male tormentors is obvious and actually quite labored. How many more movies must we sit through where females face great (male-driven) opposition and pull through by relying on sheer women-only courage. In the last twenty-minutes McAdams does nothing but beat-down and mutilate Murphy. Fair enough he head-butted her and choked her a bit, but this part is played down and forgotten quickly while Craven makes a point out of Murphy's pain and suffering. I understand that women are easy to feel sorry for in movies (a bit sexist and narrow-minded if you ask me, but hey...I hate PC) but I would like to see a film where a man fights back at a woman who has made HIS life hell. It does happen in real life you know. But men are worthless, violent, evil pigs according to films like this getting real tired of it.

Red Eye pretty much fails at everything it sets out to do simply by having a weak script and tepid direction. The teeny-bopper crowd, that this film was undeniably made for, may get a kick out of it but us older and wiser viewers who have been around long enough to appreciate Craven's stronger work will be seriously disappointed. It's worth absolutely none of your attention or hard-earned cash, but at least it's better than Cursed.",1125705600,2,3853,5.332236842105263
2443088,4,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven's ""Red Eye"" is a quick, tense, efficient little thriller, all setup and payoff. It works because it aspires to pump your blood, and does. At ninety minutes, you can do dinner-and-a-movie and conceivably get home before dawn.

The plot is thankfully spare. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), an operative for a terrorist group, forces plucky hotel manager Lisa (Rachael McAdams) to help assasinate the podium-pounding chief of Homeland Security. How? By putting a hitman outside her father's house, Rippner offers Lisa a choice: Call her hotel from a red eye flight to change the chief's room assignment; or hold a funeral for her dad.

Carl Ellworth's script milks what it can out of the first suspense - Lisa making the call - and then erects a chase when the plane lands to save the chief and Lisa's father( the estimable Brian Cox, who probably spent a whole day on the set, and invaribly will be the guy all the other actors were honored to meet in the DVD commentary). The script is clever and concise - it cares not for the motives of the terrorist group, nor does it dawdle on Lisa's personal life. If you want to read into Rippner's casual misogyny, and Lisa's eventual response, go ahead. ""Red Eye"" tacks a footnote onto the gender debate but doesn't berate the point.

Instead, it enjoys the lead performances. Murphy is fine as one of those bemused, malevolent types who talk in complete sentences but would really like to crush skulls. He becomes one of those limping caricatures of evil in the final act, his state perfectly underlined by a single line from Lisa.

McAdams does a lot of face acting - she produces some serious waterworks - and generally represents the cute, casual everywoman. Pretty. Fashionable. Loyal. Sweet. Courteous. Good with a weapon.

Combine this with her role in ""Wedding Crashers"" and she's the big winner in an average summer movie season, casting a surprising shadow on her ""Mean Girls"" co-star Lindsay Lohan, who generally become a walking tabloid since that film. There is precedent for this: Justine Bateman was the young star of ""Satisfaction"" way back when.

While the movie has some good action, I wouldn't characterize it as ""scary"".  Based on the hype, I was hoping to see a classic horror film.  Instead, you get an action film with a few scary moments.

2443093,3,B000BVM1SC,"The trailer for ""Red Eye"" makes it seem like it's going to be a taut and engrossing suspense film, and while the film is well-made and the acting, particularly by rising star Rachel McAdams, is top-notch, somehow the film never delivers on the promise given by the trailer.

What you see in the trailer is basically what you see in the movie:  a woman's (McAdams) father will be killed if she does not comply with a psychopath's (Cillian Murphy) demands.  That's really all it is; the trailer has spelt it out for you so when you watch the film, there is no real suspense.

But the film is entertaining, thanks to the direction from horror master, Wes Craven, and the strong leading performance from Rachel McAdams.  She is extremely appealing, and gives us a character worth rooting for.  Cillian Murphy is okay as the villain.  Sometimes he is a bit too hammy, and oddly, seems a bit wimpy when matched with the resourceful McAdams.

Red Eye is a decent thriller, predictable but entertaining.",1125187200,2,995,4.710982658959537
2443094,4,B000BVM1SC,"I liked this movie quite a bit, and would give a ""B +"", as a fond teacher gives a good paper that clearly shows good effort, a better-than-average essay that exceeds expectations. However, that's a school grade for a good job; this is not a ""B"" movie, and reviewers who so define it both do it an injustice and misuse a term of art.

Wickipedia defines ""B movie"" thusly: ""any low-budget movie with lesser-known (and generally considered inferior) actors (B-actors). Usually the films are formulaic and campy, with cheap special effects, uninspired dialogue, and gratuitous nudity, sexuality, and/or violence. B-movies of the horror movie genre are especially popular. B-movies today are often not even released in theaters, instead going direct-to-video.""

Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are not B actors. McAdams' recent reviews have said ""Watch out, Julia Roberts."" While I would expect Julia Roberts to be offered the role of Rachel McAdams' mother in some upcoming screenplay by an age-crazy Hollywood, the camera loves Rachel's face with less necessary favoring of  her ""good side"" than was ever true of Ms. Roberts. As sexy as the iconic Jerry Ryan, as lithe and fun to watch as the charming Jennifer Garner, McAdams (""The Notebook"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Wedding Crashers"") may ultimately show more range in her career than either of those two have yet managed. Cillian Murphy is also having a stellar year with ""Batman Begins"" and the upcoming ""Breakfast on Pluto"". With an easy charm which he uses as his first weapon of terror, Murphy's enjoyment of the effect of his dispassion when he first describes his ""real job"" to his seatmate on the plane is a wonderful understated acting job: he hasn't turned off the charm; he hasn't added too much to his nonchalant delivery; yet the coldness of his view of other people and his obvious pleasure in delivering terror is all right there on the palette.

Creating a taut thriller at 80 minutes of playing time, Wes Craven (the director) cleverly focuses our attention at the beginning of the movie on bit characters who are going to play a role in subsequent events, tipping us to upcoming plot development and letting us feel as smart as our heroine Lisa (played by Rachel McAdams) when she realizes it's up to her to fight the nightmare in which she's trapped. Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner (gotta love that Wes Craven touch!) is charming and chilling and terriyingly manipulative.

Making the manipulation of one glorified hotel clerk the lynchpin of a terror plot, the drama is made intimate. The small idiosyncracies of individuals lace the plot together, and very good editing raise this film above B fare.

Yes, there are some plot holes, but the briskness of the pace minimizes them. The production values are very good, not at all B-movie fare-- with a couple of long shot exceptions that were unnecessary to the movie. The humor in some of the devices (gotta love that voodoo pen!, the red scarf as ascot, and even the referential music in points of high tension) are played with a wink toward the audience who recognizes them as symbols, and no condescension toward those who don't. And then, of course, there's the REAL reason I went to see this movie: it's Colby Donaldson's (my favorite Survivor competitor's) first real movie role. He's still pretty cool, in my book.

While not a masterpiece, it shows some maturing of Wes Craven's style. At the least, it's a darned satisfying Saturday night at the movies.",1125187200,,3476,4.921501706484642
2443095,4,B000BVM1SC,"This flick is certainly carried by the acting performances of the two leading actors, McAdams and Murphy. Both play excellent. In a way, this movies seems like an adaptation of a stage play, but the last part of the film, off the plane in the city of Miami, changes that idea a bit. The general plot of this film which creates the threatening situations for Lisa (McAdams) is somewhat interesting, but plays a secondary role. The emphasis is clearly on the initiations, responses and reactions of the two leading actors. The soundtrack is also well done in the beginning of this flick, but becomes less prevalent as the film moves on.

It seems as if this movie is too short and most moviegoers may desire the film to be expanded by another 10-15 minutes.

My husband and I had the privilege of seeing Red Eye at a sneak preview showing in town, and we were both blown away.  Frightmeister Wes Craven has managed to put out a film that is so engaging and edge-of-your-seat thrilling that it could possibly catapult him to new heights as the master of the psychological thriller.

Rachel McAdams turns in a great performance as Lisa, the young manager of a resort hotel in Miami who is on her way home from her grandmother's funeral when she meets this handsome stranger in the line for her flight, which has been delayed because of bad weather.  Seemingly weak at first, Lisa, when home and father are threatened, busts out with a don't-mess-with-me-or-my-family attitude that heightens the tautness of this film.

Cillian Murphy, the young Irishman who portrayed Jim in the British zombie flick 28 Days Later and Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in Batman Begins, is excellent as Jackson Rippner, the handsome stranger who turns out to have an agenda of his own -- the assassination of the Homeland Security secretary; the means to accomplish his goals -- a container located underwater near the Lux Atlantic, the hotel where the secretary is staying, the men who can launch the missile, and Lisa, whom he needs to move the secretary to a top-floor suite where the men will have a clear target; and a hostage -- Lisa's father, whose house is being watched by another man that's ready to go in and kill if Lisa fails to do what Jackson tells her to.  Murphy's star is definitely on the rise, and this movie is proof of that.

All in all, Red Eye is a first-rate thriller from the mind of Wes Craven, and one that's not to be missed.",1125014400,4,1871,4.614457831325301

At the outset of the picture you meet Lisa, a young manager of the LUX hotel in Miami.  She is flying back from a funeral in Dallas when her plane is delayed forcing her to meet the charming Jackson (never Jack) Rippner.  He wines her before their flight and upon entering the plane they realize they are seated next to each other.  The trailer I though did a great job of deception because your forced to think that your about to see a romance comedy type movie and then your tossed into a thriller of all thrillers.  You see, Jackson is using Lisa to carry out his sceme of assasination and unless Lisa plays along her father is going to be murdered.  It's edge-of-your-seat the entire film, frame by frame and Cillian is the reason for the movies intesity.  He captures his charactors fierceness and forces the viewer to hate him.

2443099,3,B000BVM1SC,"Wes Craven (""Nightmare"" series) is an astute director of films with a large catalogue of thrillers: he knows how to ferret out our worst fears and use them against us.
In ""Red Eye,"" he once again pries away the veneer of safety we all hide behind and makes us acknowledge those everyday things (Craven has learned well from Hitchcock) that we fear the most: of flying, of rape, of losing control, of losing our parents and finally of terrorism in all its myriad forms. In fact the target victim of this film is the US Chief of Homeland Security, Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia).
Craven also has the casting savvy to pit the Miss America Beautiful, patrician, all-american girl with an edge Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook"") as hotel concierge, Lisa against the strange looking, scary, Irishman Cillian Murphy (""28 Days Later,"" ""Batman Begins"") as Jack Rippner (!) in a physical as well as a battle-of-wits that takes place mostly within the confines of an airplane bound for Miami.
 Mc Adams (once and for all she loses the tiara and gives an angry, psychically centered and driven performance) and Murphy are so terrific that we ignore the fact that we've seen much of this story before. But we've never seen it done this well before...that's for sure.
Craven has directed this film at a fast clip and every inch of every frame pops out at us carefully seasoned with his patented tongue in cheek wit. There are much worse ways to spend a couple of hours this Indian Summer, believe me.",1124928000,22,1480,4.714285714285714

The plot is full of holes, but the movie is so well-paced that you don't notice.  And it features a number of winning supporting performances, all of which round out the fun.",1124928000,,454,5.191780821917808
2443101,4,B000BVM1SC,"""Red Eye"" was a pleasant surprise for me.  With Wes Craven's reputation as a horror genre director with the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series and then the ""Scream"" films, I thought this would be a stalker flick, but the previews looked interesting.  Craven has proven he can change pace as with Meryl Streep in ""The Music of the Heart"" and ""Red Eye"" is a taut suspense drama.  I loved the compression of having most of the film set in the tight confines of an airplane.

Rachel McAdams is certainly one of Hollywood's new bright lights.  The daughter of a Canadian truck driver, she's come a long way from ""The Hot Chick"" & ""Mean Girls"" to Ryan Gosling's love interest in ""The Notebook"" & Owen Wilson's love interest in ""The Wedding Crashers.""  As hotel administrator Lisa Reisert, McAdams demonstrates both professional confidence and personal vulnerability as she worries about her father.

As Jackson Rippner, a Jack the Ripper pun, Irish actor Cillian Murphy is entrancing.  At first convincing as a flirtatious stranger, we soon see him metamorphize into a dangerous and committed terrorist.  With his appearances in ""Batman Begins"" as the creepy villain Dr. Jonathan Crane and as the peasant boy who loves ""The Girl With the Pearl Earring,"" he's shown the range as an actor that was glimpsed in ""28 Days.""  In short, he's the kind of guy you love to hate.

Brian Cox who was so wonderfully seedy in ""The Bourne Identity"" & ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and also played in ""The Ring"" & ""Troy"" does a good although not very demanding part of the father who for most of the movie sits in a recliner watching TV.  Then when the action hits at the end, he gets knocked out and lies unconscious.  He looks like a daddy!

A couple of other wonderful cameos are also part of this film.  As the hotel clerk filling in while Lisa Reisert attends her grandmother's funeral, Jayma Mays plays Cynthia.  She does a wonderful job of looking confused, trying to do the right thing even when she doesn't quite know what to say or which computer button to push, and then saving the day by getting the Homeland Security secretary out of his room at the Lux Atlantic before the big blow.  It's the kind of break a young actress dreams of & Craven has been very generous in her screen time.

Another lovely cameo is Angela Paton who plays the Nice Lady who gets a book from Lisa, only to have Lisa write a message in it & Jackson to steal it back.  Paton is one of those actresses you know you've seen, first appearing in ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971 & having played in Flatliners (1990), ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) & as Grandma in ""American Wedding"" (2003).  She doesn't have a major part, but she fills her screen time with depth.

I found the tension in the film to unwind at just the right intervals.  The hotel explosion did look a bit fake (computer generated), but the mix of humor and tension work well in this charmer.  It is not an ambitious plot, but what it does is done extremely well.  Enjoy!",1124928000,2,2972,4.574669187145558
2443102,3,B000BVM1SC,"On the outset I'm going to give Wes Craven's new film ""RED EYE"" my wholehearted endorsement.  It's a well-made movie that shows off Craven's talent for gripping suspense.  There were moments that this film grabbed me.  Moments where I gripped my seat and gritted my teeth, and actually interacted with the film.  That is the Hallmark of a good thriller, even if the film itself isn't that good.

RED EYE is the harrowing tale of a young woman named Lisa (Brooke Adams, Mean Girls) and a bright and yet whole heartedly inept ""BAD GUY"" named Jackson (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins), who are brought together on a Red Eye between Texas and Miami. Unbeknownst to Lisa she's caught up in a political plot to kill the head of homeland security, and the only way to survive is to outsmart her captors.  I'd mention more, but I'd spoil the eventual outcome, or maybe not.

The problem is that the whole film is on autopilot.  Everyone in the film is present and accounted for.  They all have a small piece in the puzzle.  RED EYE has one goal to get you to the end.  That's where the film fails.  It fails at a basic level where characters become plot points, and merely spout out dialogue to get from point A to point B.  If you can stand this, you'll be able to sit through the first half of the movie where mysteries are set up and briefly described away.  Where much fanfare is made of characters, who serve very little face time, and whose only goal is to get the story moving.  In fact there is a  little girl in the film whose whole point of being there is to kick a duffel bag.

But wait hold on a sec......  You told me I should go see this movie and yes I agree you should. Does the film work? Sort of.  Do I think the movie succeeds in what it's doing? Yes, but  in a very shallow and one-dimensional way.  Is this film going to make and critics top 100 lists? No.  This is the kind of film you probably find in the $5.50 bin at Walmart two years from now.  It is utterly forgettable.

But up there on the big screen, the suspense works.  The last 30 minutes of this film work perfectly.  It also includes one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a while, it's actually quite scary, and for once you feel for the Characters.  That's why you should see this movie.

Cillian Murphy was miscast in the film.  He doesn't have a face you can trust.  From the outset he always looks like something is a bit off.  His character only works when he goes psychotic near the end and because the film doesn't waste time on his back-story and you're not quite sure what he has up his sleeve.  His motivations seem silly.  What is his motive? Why is he after Lisa?  What does fulfilling his ultimate objective have to do with any of this?  And most importantly why get a ton of people involved with a plan that at the very least will fail because it's just plain stupid? Without personal  motive he's just a brash guy who kidnaps a girl, and what's so interesting about that?  The part really calls for someone more charming.  This film needs a Brad Pitt and yet it gives us a poor man's Norman Bates.

But Rachael McAdams shines as the young strong-willed women whose not afraid to talk back.  Some have said Ms. McAdams is my generation's Julia Roberts.  She just may be, but that is because she's good at what she does.  Her scenes in the airport near the end while preposterous work because she's believable.  Her performance overcomes the entire film, and adds some realism in a film that misses the mark so many times.

The other thing the film fails on is consistent tone.  Some scenes are far too dark, and others way to light.  I guess it's the way to handle the material and still hold onto the  PG-13 rating.  But when Craven jumps from drama to comedy, it's a little to jarring for my taste.  It also ends on a dumb joke, that renders the film far silly for its own good.

RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm.  It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.

***1/2 out of 5",1124841600,3,4103,4.310615989515072
2443107,4,B000BVM1SC,"Red Eye has been intriguing ever since I heard about it.  With the mysterious trailer twisting our expectations by presenting a typical romantic movie beginning with a horrific turn of events, I had high hopes for Wes Craven's new flick.  The end result was that the trailer was more creative and tricky, but Red Eye is still a really good thriller with a political twist.

This is also a movie that was hurt by the second trailer that came out.  This has been a problem in current cinema, in my opinion, where the trailer directors show too much.  The first trailer was awesome because it gave you a hint of what the movie was about but then stopped.  It left me wanting to know more.  The second trailer showed basically most of the intense scenes so that instead of being in the moment, I was thinking ""Okay so in the next part Lisa is going to..."".  With some movies that's okay.  But with a thriller, part of the thrill is not knowing what's going to happen next.  And when the trailer clearly shows that Lisa is in her house, tells the basic plot and some main plot points, the sense of thrill is lost.

What helps keep this movie afloat is the director and the two leading actors Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, both of whom are becoming rising stars.  Rachel McAdams was a great choice for this movie; her character's weakness and strength are superbly acted, making Lisa and her situation real.  And Cillian Murphy is excellent at being the handsome man with cold eyes.  When he smiles in this movie, they never touch his eyes and you can tell he holds a malicious intent under his apparently nice exterior.  Finally, Wes Craven has proven in previous films (Scream and Nightmare on Elm Street being my favorite) is adept at manipulating his audience to feel tension and fear.

However, I was disappointed with portions of the film because instead of building a sense of tension, there were points where I didn't feel any real fear.  There were scenes on the airplane where I knew I *should* feel tension but I didn't.  I'm not sure exactly why.  The end of the film also hangs on too many old tricks that Wes has used countless times before.  Heroines running upstairs, throwing vases, chairs, fire extinguishers at their assailants are old hat for Wes and he unfortunately leans on this a bit much in the last 20 minutes of the film.  It almost becomes comical instead of being intense and unfortunately you could put Neve Campbell in the role toward the end and think you're watching Scream.

What saved this movie from being an average 3 star movie was the talent attached.  Even with some of these sore spots, there were moments where the film soared above average, moments of genuine fear that reminded me why Wes Craven is so good.  Even at the end, in the house, there were parts where I wanted to hold my breath with Lisa because I knew her assailant would pop out.  It was just unfortunate that other parts were too unintentionally comical to ruin it.",1124841600,3,2973,4.564150943396227

Her performance, and Cillian Murphy's delightfully believable creepiness, save the movie to some extent at least.  It does hold your attention for an hour and a half, but there's basically nothing to it beyond the will-she-escape-and-save-the-day suspense.  Still, it's hard to depict a believable hostage story in a public place like an airliner, and this one is pretty convincing.  Just don't expect any emotional impact to last any longer than the movie itself.",1124755200,7,606,5.483870967741935
2443109,4,B000BVM1SC,"In a departure from the horror genre, Wes Craven has fashioned a taut, adrenaline-charged thriller that plugs directly into the paranoia of modern life.

Rachel McAdams plays Lisa Reisert, an executive at a tony Miami Beach hotel.  Unflappable and upbeat, Lisa is a facilitator when it comes to guest services.  To her, there are no obnoxious and demanding hotel guests - there are only clients with special needs.

Returning from her grandmother's funeral in Dallas, Lisa encounters a friendly and attractive young man in the airport bar when her flight is delayed.  Once she boards her plane, she is surprised to find this same stranger sitting in the aisle seat directly next to her.  The stranger introduces himself as Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), and in the space of a few minutes goes from a pleasant fellow passenger to an ominous and ruthless predator.  Jackson tells Lisa that he represents a group of individuals who are interested in ""sending a message,"" and that he needs her to arrange for a switch in the hotel rooms reserved for the impending visit of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.  In return for her cooperation, he will instruct the man stationed outside her father's house not to go inside and murder him.  As an offering of proof as to the hitman's proximity to her father, he produces her father's wallet.  Thus, a pitched battle of wits begins.

Taken hostage in plain sight, Lisa is unable to signal any of the other passengers or crew lest she endanger her father's life.  Although Lisa is horrified and distraught, Jackson has seriously misjudged the kind of person she is.  Lisa is no passive victim.  Wily and resourceful, she is a professional problem solver.

Once the plane lands, the film kicks into overdrive.  Lisa proves herself to be as much of a formidable physical opponent as a mental one, stealing Jackson's cell phone and, in a rather horrifying scene, renders him physically incapable of calling on another phone (don't ask).

Any plot holes or predictability there may be in the film are more than compensated for in the first-rate performances of the two principal actors.  Murphy's cool androgynous beauty allows him to shift from boyish and amiable to remote and reptilian in a heartbeat.  You believe this snarling and abusive thug when he says it's nothing personal - he would have to be a person for it to be personal.  Rachel McAdams is totally convincing as Lisa.  She is smart, capable and determined, utilizing any resource at hand.  Brian Cox is featured in a supporting role as Lisa's father.

The terrorist on an airplane scenario may, understandably, be too prickly and disturbing for some viewers.  I personally had a very hard time with the penned-in claustrophobia of the airplane cabin and the violent lurching of the plane during turbulence.  I tend to be a white knuckle flyer, and the big screen and Dolby surround-sound left me feeling rather green around the gills.

If you are interested in a tension-filled thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock, I can recommend Red Eye (although you may want to wait until after you return from any summer vacation trips involving air travel).",1124755200,3,3162,4.918867924528302

Shaking the rain off, she stands in line at the airport terminal and meets Jackson (Cillian Murphy, ""Batman Begins"", ""28 Days Later""). Jackson calms a tense situation with another passenger and then introduces himself, telling Lisa that he will be in the bar, waiting for the plane, if she cares to join him. She politely begs off but does end up having a drink with him. As Lisa boards the plane, she finds that she is sitting next to Jackson. The plane takes off and Lisa becomes nervous, because she hates to fly prompting Jackson to try to calm her, by getting her to talk about her dad, Joe (Brian Cox). After the plane has lifted through the turbulence, he reveals that he knows a lot more about Lisa than he should and he simply needs Lisa to make a phone call. If she does, her dad will not be harmed by the man sitting outside of his house.

""Red Eye"" directed by Wes Craven (""Cursed"", the ""Scream"" films, ""Nightmare Before Elm Street"") is a very good example of the thriller genre.

I think the first trailer released for this film is a brilliant piece of marketing. The trailer paints the film as a nice, romantic drama featuring a chance meeting between Lisa and Jackson. They meet in the airport, they have a snack together, then, lo and behold, they find they are sitting next to each other. The flight will be a pleasant affair. Just as the trailer has convinced you of this, a title card appears announcing ""A Film by Wes Craven"", in red lettering, and the music becomes ominous. The trailer is so brilliant, because it so completely convinced me that the film would be a romantic drama before switching gears, that my hopes were raised for this film.

""Red Eye"" has a lot going for it. Not the least of its attributes is that the film is very brisk and clocks in at about 85 minutes long. This provides Craven with little room for lingering on anything and he keeps things moving. The subplot, which begins before we even meet Lisa, is introduced with a series of brief shots depicting the machinations of a group who need Lisa's help. These shots are quick, informative and interesting. Then the main story kicks in and we leave this group for a while.

When we meet Lisa, you might think the film would seem to slow down a little, but upon reflection, I realized that every scene has at least two purposes in the plot. The initial encounter between Lisa and Jackson, in line at the ticket counter, would seem to serve only one purpose, to introduce the two characters to one another. Later in the film, one of the characters involved makes a brief reappearance. In fact, many of the minor characters are introduced and we learn a little bit about their characters. In some way or fashion, they will all have another moment or two to either help or complicate the journey of Lisa and Jackson.

Because all of these minor characters are given a `history', the film rises above the rest of the pack. Most films don't even bother with minor characters, using them simply as window dressing. In ""Red Eye"", they become a part of the story. An older flight attendant complains to her co-worker about a broken coffee pot and the company stealing her pension from her. A little girl is flying alone for the first time. An elderly woman strikes up a conversation with Lisa about the Dr. Phil book her father loaned her. A woman flirts insistently with Jackson asking for his help with her bag. All of this may seem like busy work, but Craven and the writers, Carl Ellsworth and Dan Foos tie it all back to the plot and make them a part of the story. Because of this level of detail, the film is, ultimately, stronger.

The relationship between Lisa and Jackson is intriguing and interesting to watch. Lisa isn't the normal helpless heroine. She reveals that she may be a little tougher than Jackson hoped and ultimately becomes a more interesting adversary to him. Jackson is also quietly menacing, quick to smile to someone on the plane who may have noticed them, to assuage their concerns, to make them invisible again. Speaking in low tones, he makes it clear that he will carry out his threats.

The movie becomes a bit more standard after the plane lands in Miami. Part of the reason the film works is that the two characters are in the middle of a sea of people in a confined airplane chamber. Once the plane lands, their world expands and there are many other influences upon each of their actions. The finale is pretty standard for thrillers and less than spectacular, dragging the rest of the film down. But thankfully, this section is also very briskly paced and over quickly.

""Red Eye"" suffers from a lackluster final 10 minutes, but it is still far above average for a film in this genre. Definitely worth a bargain matinee.",1124668800,68,4891,4.568985176738883

Lisa, a hotel receptionist, is confronted by her seatmate on an airplane to change the room of a high profile businessman/politician (so that he can be assinated) or her father will be killed.

2443116,5,B000BVM1SC,"""Red-Eye"" is great! This is one of Wes Craven's best films since ""Scream"". Rachel McAdams (Lisa Reisert) and Cillian Murphy (Jackson Rippner) are great in their roles. The screenplay by Carl Ellsworth and the story by Ellsworth and Dan Foos is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also composed the score to the Scream movies and Cursed) is excellent. The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is great. The film editing by Stuart Levy & Patrick Lussier (who has also edited the last 7 movies of Craven's) is great. The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting for the Scream movies and Cursed) & Sarah Katzman (who also did the casting for Craven's Cursed) is great. The production design by Bruce Alan Miller (who also did the production design for Scream & Scream 3, and also did the production design for Music Of The Heart and Cursed) is excellent. The art direction by Andrew Max Cahn (who also did the art direction for Cursed) is excellent. The set decoration by Maggie Martin is excellent. The costume design by Mary Claire Hannan is excellent. This is a suspense thriller that is well-executed and gives Craven an excellent chance to do more suspense thrillers. I, somewhat, was not surprised by Craven's transition into suspense thrillers, because of his ability to make people think and his ability to scare people.",1124582400,3,1338,4.847161572052402
2443117,1,B000BVM1SC,"If you want Hollywood to start making worthwhile films again, the movie going public must stop spending money on junk! Affecting the bottom line is the only message Hollywood understands!

This film has all the feeling of a really bad, 1980's television movie! It's shallow, flat, campy, boring, low-budget, tedious, silly, very formula, irritating, and did I say - just plain dull? The perfect date movie! No need to be distracted by what happens on screen!

The funniest moment of this Wes Craven disaster happens when a terrorist just lets go some huge bazooka round from a rather small boat, and shouts, in a very clear FRENCH accent: ""Speed!, Speed!"" Very cute! Sounds more like a comedy than a thriller!

Another humorous component is if you're a very young, 20-something, hotel desk manager with good customer service skills, you can successfully kill professionally trained assassins just by thinking fast, like you do at work! Keep that in mind the next time you feel like yelling at someone behind a hotel desk who is trying to find your reservation! These folks are specially trained to deal with disgruntled people like you!

If this movie had the slightest bit of character development, or the story was remotely plausible, then, just maybe, it would be salvageable. But no! Red Eye is so ridiculous and low-budget, you have to wonder if Wes Craven bothered watching it when it was finally completed. One has to wonder!",1124582400,6,1432,4.929460580912863
2443118,4,B000BVM1SC,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was stunned.  Was Wes Craven actually making a serious movie again? Apparently so.  However, I'm actually more forgiving of Craven's recent material than many  serious horror fans, as I actually liked all the 'Scream' movies (Even though they're about 1/10 as clever as they think they are), and found 'Cursed' to be passably entertaining, even if it was undeniably crappy.  Still, quasi-parodic horror films have never really been my bag, and I was definitely getting pretty tired of them, so it's nice to say one of the main purveyors of that sorta thing has gone straight, again.  Now, 'Red-Eye' isn't great, by any, means, but it's well made and well acted and tightly plotted and paced.  That's enough.

As you probably already know, 'Red-Eye' is about Lisa Reisert, a hotel manager whose accosted on a plane by Jackson Rippner, a terrorist who wants her to move Homeland Security chief Keefe to a different room, presumably to allow him to be assassinated more readily.  If she doesn't do this, Jackson's cohorts will kill Lisa's father.  That's really about all there is to it, and it's, naturally, about Lisa's trying to prevent either deaths, and communicate her situation to others etc.  As noted before, this film is extremely efficient, as  it's about 75 minutes long if you don't include the credits  Most thriller or horror films have a bit of tiresome filler, somewhere, but 'Red-Eye' has virtually none, setting up the premise cleanly and giving us little information we don't need.  (For example, I like how we never learn who Jackson is and why he wants to kill Keefe, because, seriously, what difference does it make.)  Yet, it also avoids making Lisa a completely hollow, faceless character, unlike so many thriller or horror protagonists. (And she's certainly more likable than Neve Campbell or Christina Ricci were in Craven's last few films)

The key to the film is Cillian Murphy's fantastic performance as Jackson.  I first saw Cillian in the brilliant movie '28 Days Later', where he was the protagonist, but he's moved onto villainy now.  He was pretty cool in 'Batman Begins', but he definitely takes it to the next level here, providing your classic menacing, but also charismatic and cool villain, all while still seeming to be essentially human. Of course, this leads to a minor caveat: Jackson is more charismatic and intriguing than Lisa, so I was generally rooting for him, making it somewhat frustrating when he's repeatedly foiled.

Many have complained about the final act of this movie.  It takes place on the ground, at Lisa's home, and is fairly conventional.  Frankly, this  could easily pass for the  ending of a slasher film, where Lisa runs about the house and fights Jackson with various household items.  Again, I have seen this ending plenty of times before, but it still works. And, it is particularly well done, if for no other reason than the characters involved are better drawn and more interesting than they'd usually be. (And, for once the film has a reason why the protagonist wouldn't just run the hell outta there. i.e. if she does, her unconscious father will be left at Jackson's mercy)  And yeah, some of the events leading up to this are highly unlikely, but I've seen plausibility stretched plenty further a hundred times before.

As usual, Craven's direction is nothing particularly flashy, just with lotsa tight, claustrophobic close-ups while they're on the the plane.  And, when they actually get back to the house, the scene is a lot more coherent than that sorta thing usually is.

Lastly, the film has a few attempts at humor, most of which are extremely lame.  But again, there isn't much.

Well that's it.  Not a brilliant film, but a sufficiently intriguing scenario and a great performance from Murphy.  Definitely worth checking out.

2443119,3,B000BVM1SC,"Look, I love Rachel McAdams, she is the next big thing.

This is a good vehicle for her in some ways. However, this movie is not suspenseful, one or two scenes maybe. McAdams rises above an otherwise by the book ""thriller"". You do care about her character. Brian Cox quite literally phones in his performance.

Cillian Murphy is creepy admittedly. It is timely with regards to its terrorism angle. Not even going to say this movie could have been much better. It's just a weak plot all in all. Sorry, but thumbs down.",1124582400,3,517,4.548387096774194
2443120,3,B000BVM1SC,"This is a very fun end-of-the-summer thriller. Wes Craven truly proves his ""master of suspense"" title with this one. For Wes Craven fanatics, this one is quite different from his other films. You won't see Freddy Krueger come out of the airplane and start killing people! lol. Craven does a good job of keeping the tone in the airplane very tension-filled for the audience.

Rachel McAdams seems like she's been in a lot this past year. (The Notebook, Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers) Everything she touches his box office gold! She is a very talented actress. She plays an excellent victim role in this one showing real fear and anxiety while this killer sits next to her threatening to kill her father.

The real star of the movie is Cillian Murphy as the killer on the plane. This is one of the creepiest performances of the summer. Just by watching him, you get a little frightened b/c he just has this look in his eye that gives off pure terror. In Batman Begins, he was good and creepy as The Scarecrow, but that was just comic book stuff. Red Eye is where he truly takes shape in his acting abilities. He plays the role very subtle and terrifyingly. He nevers goes over the top, which is what I was hoping he wouldn't do.

So for a great ride of suspence and so much edge-of-your-seat terror that you'll end up screaming for Rachel McAdams to get free, this one will surely fullfill your needs.",1124582400,3,1398,4.5396825396825395
2443121,4,B000BVM1SC,"Red-Eye is the best straight suspense movie since Hostage (that is, not horror or sci-fi).  It's about a woman (Rachel McAdams) terrorized by a terrorist on an airliner.  She's the manager of a hotel where the deputy director of Homeland Security is going to stay.  The terrorists want to kill him, and they need her to change his room assignment at the last minute and make it look innocent.  The one who accosts her on the plane (Cillian Murphy) threatens to murder her father if she doesn't make a call from the plane to change the rooms.  He says they're watching her father, ready to kill him.

Most of the story takes place on the plane, so if you like suspense films of the Airport variety, you'll probably enjoy it; I did.  There is also some humor that's not inappropriate about the new girl on the job at the hotel, who has to deal with the situation from that end.

There are a few plot points that don't add up, and that could spoil the movie for some.  I won't spoil it by specifying, but while you're absorbed in the suspense and action you won't have time to think about the logic, so it probably won't bother you if you just want to be entertained; only if you want to treat the movie as a serious proposition and analyze it afterward. Anyway, it's certainly more plausible than Mr. And Mrs. Smith, or Collateral with Tom Cruise last year, both entertaining in spite of plot holes.",1124582400,2,1397,4.447058823529412
2443122,3,B000BVM1SC,"This movie does some things right. First, Cillian Murphy (who you may have seen in Batman Returns as the scarecrow) is terrific as the villian. Cillian is like salt and pepper. He makes any film taste a little better. I also enjoyed the music (classic pysho thriller music). Wes Craven also did a good job creating a world of interesting characters (none of the characters are the same or boring).

Red eye does seem to be clich'e (in a psycho movie sense). I found myself thinking ""havent I seen this all before"". Anyone who gives this movie 5 stars obviously hasn't seen many movies. Ravenous, Fatal Attraction, American psycho are thrillers worthy of 5 stars.  Collateral with Tom Cruise was a solid 4 star psycho thriller in 2004. Anyone with a brain can figure out that Red Eye doesn't measure up to Collateral or the other movies I mentioned.

(ABOUT THE ENDING)
The ending is way too predictable (you see it coming from like 10,000 miles away). Also I hate when movies aren't consistent with the characters. Rachel McAdams is a sissy mouse the whole movie. Then at the end she turns into the terminator. Cillian Murphy who is a violent psycho the whole movie turns into a punching bag.
