7013536,1,B00TPL8DXQ,"I love the first two Jurassic Park movies. The third one was terrible. The fourth one looks promising, but I have to say that I hate how Universal Home Entertainment have botched the design of this series. Just like the previous Jurassic Park collection, this packaging is terrible and a disgrace to the Jurassic Park brand. The cover art is atrocious. The logo is wrong. This is simply a repackaging of the assets they already released, but with a space for the fourth instalment.",1428364800,6,481,4.738095238095238
7013537,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"NOTE:  When I first submitted this review it was for the 3-D package.  Amazon has now put it with the package that includes a digital HD version but no 3-D for the first film in the series.  Both version are available.  Universal has new packaging of the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy coming out ahead of the fourth of the series in the summer of 2015.  It includes a 3-D Blu Ray version of the original ""Jurassic Park"" as well as Blu Ray 2-D versions of the second and third film.  All are also available on a high definition digital download as well.  It all comes in new packaging which Universal hopes will entice you to spend another $45 or so on yet another iteration of the films.

The picture in each case is 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, so yes that will fill up your wide-screen TV with beautiful, clear high definition.  Each film has a DTS-HD MA lossless 7.1 surround sound...and it sounds great. If you want the full effect of a hissed off T-Rex bellows or his thunder steps this is your baby. Small sounds are equally cool. Check out the 'raptor's claws on the stainless steel cabinets in the first film.

While the technical aspects of the discs are universally excellent, the three films vary in quality. Here are my 2-D reviews of the films:

This review is from: JURASSIC PARK (5.0 Stars)

For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic. For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real. Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell. The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.

Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other. He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago. He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.

Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters. To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.

This review is from: THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (3.0 Stars)

If this film was original, perhaps it would have been perceived to be better than it is. Unfortunately it will always be compared to the original ""Jurassic Park"" from 3 years earlier. This film, also adapted from a Michael Crichton novel, doesn't pass the test but for one exception. The Stan Winston dinosaurs are more plentiful and even more convincing.

In this story we find out that while the original Jurassic Park and its animals were destroyed, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) had another nearby island where the actual cloning took place before the animals were removed to the park. His company is now in bankruptcy and is run by his no-good nephew (Arliss Howard) who wants to capture and move the animals to San Diego. So Hammond recruits Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) again to lead a crew who would photograph and document the animals before the evil nephew gets there. Malcolm (a survivor from the first film) refuses to go until he is told his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) is already on the island. So off he goes with 2 other crew members, Nick (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie (Richard Schiff).

While the original kids, Lex and Tim, show up for a cameo appearance early in the film, they don't make the trip. So the kid factor comes in the way of Malcolm's stowaway teenage daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester). The fact that she's black and Malcolm isn't doesn't come up until Vaughn's character says to another, ""does anyone see a family resemblance?"" So I guess that's addressed.

There are some exciting scenes in this sequel. One involves Sarah and Nick deciding to treat a baby T-Rex who has a broken leg. They take it back to the trailer at the base camp. Gee, neither of these scientists thought that perhaps the infants cries might attract mom and/or dad. After ignoring the phone in the trailer that would have warned them of their obvious peril, dino-dad and mom let the scientists know what they thought of the idea of doctoring their kid.

Except for a few humorous quips from Goldblum's character, the film is hampered by ridiculous dialog and even more ridiculous circumstances. Some of these are the equivalent of the teenagers in a horror movie who don't leave the haunted house when they have a chance. There is enough here however to recommend the film, albeit without much enthusiasm.

This review is from: JURASSIC PARK III (3.5 Stars)

Steven Spielberg does himself a favor by relinquishing the director duties after the letdown of ""The Lost World"" sequel. Fort Worth native Joe Johnston (""Captain America: The First Avenger"") takes over and brings back a bit of the wonder of the original. Even Alexander Payne who directed acclaimed films like ""The Descendants"" and ""Sideways"" gets involved as a co-writer.

In this episode we find a separated couple (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) hiring Alan Grant (returning Sam Neill) to take them to Site B on an island near Costa Rica. This of course was the hatching ground for the various prehistoric animals that was abandon years earlier. Their hidden agenda is actually a rescue mission to retrieve their teenage son (always must have a teen) played by Trevor Morgan. Eric (Morgan) doesn't do high flying gymnastics like Kelly did in the previous sequel but it's pretty clear he is a self sufficient adventurer. He and his mom's boyfriend manage to parachute onto the dino infested island without an easy path to escape.

The filmmakers do a few things right in this iteration. With the various plot points pretty much used up they keep the length at a tidy 92 minutes. Instead of the usual alpha-dino T-Rex as the ultimate eating machine, we get an even bigger and meaner Spinosaurus that eats planes as well as humans. Even better, when a T-Rex does stumble upon the scene, the Spinosaurus shows him who the real king is. Best of all is that the cast is kept small, leaving out the multitudes of testosterone ladled mercenaries we got in part II. Well that is, until the final ridiculous scene. At least we don't get transported to the U. S. with another King Kong-like exhibit. As usual the real stars here are the dinosaurs; especially the Velociraptors who we now know are intelligent hunters with communication skills. Part III isn't nearly as good as the original ""Jurassic Park,"" but it does improve on the second and it has the best looking dinosaurs around.

The package as you might expect is loaded with extras, all contained on the specific disc of the movie referenced rather than a separate disc. Included are deleted scenes, numerous featurettes, behind the scenes stuff, games, commentaries. In all over 2 hours worth.",1426982400,20,7187,4.84257748776509

7013577,3,B00TPL8DXQ,"Back to my impressions of the 4K UHD version of the Jurassic ParK box

This box contains the 4 Jurassic Park released so far in 4K UHD, blu ray (be careful they are the same blu-ray as those of the previous version no remaster) and digital copy

there is a little good and unfortunately the complete crash, it must be said, in this box

Then the picture, we can read everywhere that this is a real master 4K, but certainly old 4K. And well let me doubt strongly, for my part I think there was no remastering 4K on the first film and the 3rd, given the shallow depth of field and the resolution well below a master 4k, it looks more like a 2K remaster and so they reused these old masters from blu ray to make 4K

Jurassic Park: 2/5
The image of blu-ray was not extremely accurate on this first film, the special effects downright blurry and in 4K unfortunately it's worse. Blame it on a 4K remasterisation not done? the question is valid. The images seem more beautiful on the 4K version but when we alternate with the Blu-ray version we notice that the difference is actually more subtle, we just cleaned the image to remove the grain (DNRise as it looks) and rebooster the colors (thank you the hdr), capturing images of 2 versions and comparing it can be seen that sometimes the blu ray is better than the 4K version, a height. A blatant example is the early scene with brontosaurs, no depth of field, smoothed images where is the interest of the 4K? Unfortunately the problem does not arise only on scenes with special effects. Of course the compression is better and some halo due to filters artificially increasing the definition (edge enhanced) have disappeared on the 4K version, proof already that for the version blu ray the quality of the master already asked question. In short very disappointed for this film yet essential that would have deserved a real master recent 4K

The Lost World: 4/5
This is the good surprise of this box, comparing the images of blu ray and 4K version I feel that we are dealing with a real master 4K and not the same as that of blu ray. Incredible depth of field and no or almost no smoothing, in any case much better manage than on the first and third film

Jurassic Park III: 2/5
We are in the same case as for the first part, image sometimes below the blu ray because it was dnrise with the same master

Jurassic World: 4/5
The blu-ray is recent, I have not seen a significant gain with the 4K except the contribution HDR, but the dive is more accurate but not transcendent given the age of the film, nevertheless the contribution 4K is interesting and real compared to the first and third films.

Basically for those who do not have the Blu-ray version, the 4K investment is interesting but if you already have the Blu-ray version you will necessarily be disappointed.",1532304000,,2813,4.48046875

7013636,3,B00TPL8DXQ,This set was suppose to come with a Blu-ray version of all four movies as well as the 3D version of the first and fourth movie but the set I received was missing both the Blue-ray and 3D version of Jurassic World. Instead the place where the movies should be were filled with cardboard disc cutouts. Luckily I had previously purchased Jurassic World on Blue-ray so I still have it. But the fact that all the movies promised when buying this set weren't there still made me rather unhappy.,1530316800,,488,4.49438202247191
7013637,5,B00TPL8DXQ,Awesome deal for all of these movies including 3D versions!,1530316800,,59,5.0
7013658,5,B00TPL8DXQ,THIS WAS GREAT BUY!!! I haven't started watching the movies yet but I know they will work because it was newly packaged BRAND NEW!!!! What I love the most is the hardcover book the movies came in oh and all the digital copies worked... I loved it!!!,1530316800,,249,4.319148936170213
7013659,2,B00TPL8DXQ,Disappointed! Came with Jurassic Park 1-3 and not Jurassic world!! Said it would and has the spot for it and everything... all it included was a cardboard disc!,1530316800,,160,4.75
7013660,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"Its a nice collection of the movies, quality is good. If you can find it on sale its a nice addition for the Jurassic Park fan.",1530230400,,127,3.923076923076923
7013661,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"I got a great deal on the blu ray set. However, of the 4 digital codes, 2 were for the same movie (lost world). So now I'm missing the digital copy of Jurassic park 3. I'm bummed, but still it was a good deal. Just wish it all would have been there.",1530230400,,249,3.8076923076923075

Jurassic Park
Jurassic Park 3D
Jurassic Park: The Lost World
Jurassic Park III
Jurassic World
Jurassic World 3D
The quality is great. I really only love Jurassic Park, but it's satisfying to have all of the franchise so far in one boxset.",1530144000,,296,4.4
7013665,5,B00TPL8DXQ,Love it.,1530144000,,8,3.5
7013666,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"Movies in this package in the order of their coolness, in my (correct) opinion:

1. Jurassic Park (always and forever)
2. Jurassic World
3. Jurassic Park III
4. The Lost World

Fallen Kingdom is *not* in this package (don't be an idiot and think it isit's still in flipping theaters)but would probably take the spot at #3, if it was.

T-Rex will always have a special place in my heart, as will the velociraptors.

The Lost World 3 is rumored to be coming in late 2020.",1530144000,,469,4.4186046511627906
7013667,5,B00TPL8DXQ,Ok so i bought this on Lightning deal the other day for a fantastic price and right off the bat I was really worried that my set would be shorted like a lot of people I keep seeing on the reviews. Fortunately mine was completely in tact. I received all movies including Jurassic World. I also received 2 3D versions of original and World. Now...as far as the digital codes..I honestly would never know if they work because I have never redeemed or used any of my digital codes. It does say it includes 4 codes so I'm going to assume they are ok. It's very strange how some people are getting this box set and have missing discs are no discs at all! I don't know if its because I am a Prime Member and it comes from Amazon only and not a 3rd party seller or what is happening with those box sets! That being said...it is very disappointing to hear that and I am sure eventually it will happen to me. Overall I am very happy with this box set and unlike Indiana Jones box set these sleeves aren't so tight you cannot get the movies out without scratching them up!,1530144000,,1061,4.205882352941177
7013688,2,B00TPL8DXQ,"The box has a huge deep line cut through it. I would normally blame an antsy warehouse worker with a loose box cutter, but the fact is this cut was made BEFORE it was shrink wrapped. That's right, it's underneath the plastic, which is uncut. Weird.

Other than that the movies look nice enough, especially the first and Jurassic World, which are by far the best entries in the movie series anyway.

The packaging, (aside from the deep cut made through my set) is pretty lackluster. I don't really care for this cardboard style packaging. I plan on keeping my optical media for many years to come so I welcome the hard plastic cases instead of this. So, yeah, not impressed with it at all.",1530057600,,688,4.496
7013689,5,B00TPL8DXQ,The best release so far. The book is awesome but wish the quality of the pictures was a tad sharper,1530057600,,99,4.0
7013690,1,B00TPL8DXQ,"Movies are wonderful - of course, but this was supposed to come with digital copies - when I typed in the code, I only received 2 of 4 movies in digital format. I tried to reach out to Universal Digital Copy like the slip told me to - no responses. ARG.",1530057600,,253,3.980392156862745
7013691,2,B00TPL8DXQ,I specifically purchased this for the digital copies.  It was cheaper to buy this package than buying the digital copy. The codes were wrong and I didn't get the digital copy for the 2nd movie at all.  Very disappointing and waste of money since I own all of the movies on disc already.,1530057600,,286,4.377358490566038
7013692,4,B00TPL8DXQ,It comes with everything promised! My only issue was it came slightly damaged.,1530057600,,78,5.076923076923077

7013694,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"Bought the movies during a lightning deal, the price was amazing! To my surprise both Jurassic Park (First) and Jurassic World (Fourth) movie come in blu-ray and blu-ray 3D format, definitely a bonus! Not sure if anyone else experienced the issue I had with the digital code for Jurassic Park 3, it gives me a duplicate code for The Lost World: Jurassic Park. No biggie though, I'm sure a simple phone call to would help. I'm assuming it was previously owned being that the box was a tad beat up and some of the discs had finger prints, no scratches. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and excited to see the 5th one and eventually add it to my collection.",1530057600,,663,4.487603305785124
7013695,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"Good collection to own. I got it as a lightning deal. Loved re-watching the old movies with my kids. We watched them all again in anticipation of the newest one out in theaters (that one is good to see too).

My only issue is with the Digital HD codes inside. I had to contact with NBCU to get it resolved. On my digital insert there is a code for each movie. The code for Jurassic Park III didn't work and UniversalDigitalCopy.com thought it was an extra code for The Lost World when I was trying to input the code. So, just be aware there may be an error with your codes. I'd input them sooner rather than later just in case you need to contact NBCU. A few days after you contact them, they will probably send you an email requesting a photo or scan of the digital code sheet along with which country you are located in. They followed up that with a replacement code that worked!",1529971200,,881,4.244047619047619
7013696,4,B00TPL8DXQ,Got this collection when they had a lightening deal a few days ago ......was hesitant about purchasing because of mixed reviews but decided to go for it for $16. Overall happy with this purchase. Would have given 5 stars but we had an extra Jurassic World and no Jurassic Park 3D but all blue ray discs play perfect no issues and all 4 movies were included as well as Jurassic World 3D as well as the coded to download digital copies of all 4 movies,1529971200,,449,4.294117647058823
7013697,3,B00TPL8DXQ,"I liked everything except for the issue of redeeming the digital copies. All of them worked except for Jurassic Park III's digital code, which brought up an error (it seemed to think the code was for one of the other films which had already been redeemed). Glad I have the hardcopy but kind of wanted to get all of the digital access as well...",1529971200,,344,4.390625
7013708,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"This product was beyond my expectations. The 4k quality is phenomenal on my Samsung 4k TV, the bundling of the films makes it so convenient and quite a beautiful case for the movies. I enjoy special anniversary products such as this because it reminds fans why they've come to love these franchises. The original trilogy alone in 4k was enough for me to snatch this product up. The quality is a step up, sound is stellar. If your a Jurassic Park fan, you will love this guarantee.",1529971200,,480,4.528735632183908
7013709,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"Product was perfectly priced on a lightning deal, an amazing way to own the original trilogy plus Jurassic World. Pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of 3D versions of the First and Latest films! The book form is a very unique and clever way to consolidate a type of collection like this, having footnotes for each film is both fun for the collector or an average blu-ray owner.

Odd Note: I was a little put off by the shipping of this Box Set, as it was shipped loose with no bubble wrap or protection (plastic wrap was also ripped on arrival), but I am keeping the set as the book was undamaged. Just a little rough on the cardboard sleeve it fits into.",1529971200,,658,4.39344262295082

7013713,2,B00TPL8DXQ,"I blame myself for not reading thoroughly but I am disappointed all the way around.  The Blu-Ray set is only 3 movies, not all 4.  And while the ""book"" that they are enclosed in is pretty fantastic visually each disk slides in and out of a cardboard slot and I can already tell they are going to get scratched.  Not cool. I wish I had just bought them all separate so they had their own case.  I may buy some empty disc cases to put them in for safe keeping.

I got almost halfway through the first one (when the T rex is attacking) and it froze up and then 'reset' back on the main menu like I just put the DVD in. I found approximately where I'd been, started watching again, and at the same exact point it did the same thing again. Realizing it must be something wrong with that spot in the movie, the next time I fast forwarded to past that point, but a few minutes in it did the same thing. The movie is unwatchable.",1529798400,,509,4.1

7013799,3,B00TPL8DXQ,"I recently purchased a copy of this at Target, where this item is normally an exclusive. (This matters because that means all of these sets should be from the same core distributor.) When I got it home and opened it, I discovered that there was another copy of Jurassic Park in the Lost World sleeve. (The Lost World was absent from the set entirely.)
I brought the set back to Target and exchanged them. I opened the new set at the Guest Service counter, and lo and behold! The new set had the same exact issue. Two JPs no JP:LW.
The manager grabbed yet another set, this time from the back room. We opened that one at the counter as well. This time all for movies were there in the correct sleeves.

We were VERY lucky and the manager was understanding, so we didn't have trouble doing the exchanges once we opened the second set which had the same issue right there at the counter.

My rating is based almost entirely on this experience, as I've yet to really look over the rest of the included materials inside the set.

Looking at the box, I think it's nice, I like the design and functionality. The sound clip is good quality, and plays a good amount of the iconic theme song.

But yeah. Heads up. You might be missing a disk.",1529193600,,1232,4.343478260869565

7013814,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"Wow! All I can say is if you get the chance to own THIS 4K set of the first 4 Jurassic Park movies, invest in it!
I just watched the first 2 today and they are incredible. The first one is flawless, meaning that it still looks fabulous 25 years from the making of it. There is no dirt at all throughout the film. I have a 55"" Ultra 4K and kudos to Universal for THIS box set!
I think it is much better in design overall than the white Blu-ray version that has been out for the 4 movies.
Some reviews have been attached to this BOX SET below and you can see what I am talking about.
**** The slipcover of the 4K set is actually embossed with the Jurassic Park logo. Very nice touch. The foldout inside has the discs in their own individual sleeves with nicely done graphic photos throughout the ""book"".
THIS IS THE SET TO GET folks! With 4K taking the center stage now in home video viewing, these movies have renewed life in the Ultra Format.
The difference now is the color spectrum that comes with Ultra 4K and the picture is superior to previous releases.
As with any discs housed in sleeve type cases, handle with care is the standard procedure. The inside of the sleeves that house the discs are coated and slick, so it looks as though they should never scratch any surface for years of enjoyment.
Another reviewer says that part 4 in the series doesn't look that good. Well, it does and it is an improvement over the standard blu-ray that's been out for a few years. 4K is the way to go on this series.
A BEAUTIFUL SET !!",1527811200,3,1527,4.232876712328767
7013815,5,B00TPL8DXQ,I've only watched Jurassic World so far and I'm fairly sure the older ones won't look quite as good but WOW! The wide color gamut. The HDR. This is the best looking 4K movie I've seen yet. Absolutely spectacular.,1527811200,2,212,4.461538461538462
7013816,5,B00TPL8DXQ,LOVE IT,1527811200,,7,3.0
7013817,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"Please Note: My review and ratings are based on the quality of the new 4K versions of these films--images, sound, and extras and how these compare to the previously released Blu-ray versions of the films.  I am not rating the acting, direction, set design, etc. which can be found in other places, but instead helping you decide to upgrade to 4K or pass.

The new 4K UHD versions of the previously released Jurassic Park films contains eight discs housed in a DigiBook included in a box.  The DigiBook has limited text, but photos from each of the films and a listing of the special features on each disc.  It is a bound book and better than most releases which typically have just a frame for holding discs.  With this DigiBook you can turn the pages, and slide out the disc of your choice.  Four of the discs are the new 4K UHD versions of the following already-released Jurassic Park films:

Jurassic Park
The Lost World: Jurassic Park
Jurassic Park III
Jurassic World

The remaining four discs contain the standard Blu-ray versions of these films and are exactly as they were released previously. All of the special features are contained on the standard Blu-ray discs.  While there are a number of special features included, NONE are new for this release.  They  have all appeared in earlier boxed sets or individual discs of the Jurassic films in standard Blu-ray format.  The only really new things included are the four 4K UHD discs and the DigiBook and box.  Just so you are clear on this.

I am going to summarize the 4K quality of all four films here.  As these are brought to market individually I will post more detailed reviews of each.  Overall the visual quality of the four films rates about a 4 out of 5 in comparison to other 4K UHD releases.  This has not been a highly-reworked set and perhaps it does not need to be given that these are not films from the 60s or 70s.  If you pay special attention you will still see minor grains, pops, speckles and lines as you will see in the earlier Blu-ray releases.  It is all about getting the original negatives or first prints to start with, and then painstakingly working it to perfection.  If you start with a copy of a copy and do not put in a lot of effort into cleaning things up, the 4K version will not jump out from the earlier Blu-ray despite having four times as many pixels.  Universal put in an average effort with the video conversion to 4K.

Having said that, three of the four films show better overall quality of detail, better clarity, more vivid colors, more contrast (these are HDR-10 films in 4K), and saturation than the earlier Blu-ray releases. However this is an overall impression of the films.  Some scenes in three of the four films show little improvement from the standard Blu-ray versions, but most scenes are improved.  The one film that does not show much improvement from Blu-ray to 4K is Jurassic Park III.  Quite candidly I went back and forth between the two versions but just could not see much of a difference.  Maybe that is appropriate, because this film was the least liked of the four by both viewers and critics.  It is hard to say which is visually best in 4K, but I would say it is Jurassic World with the other two close behind.

As for the sound upgrades, all four films are strongly improved from the earlier Blu-ray versions.  The sound in the new releases is DTS:X Master Audio and it sounds great!  Makes no difference if you are hearing dinosaurs, birds, jungle atmospheric sounds, dialogue, vehicles or whatever.  There is a noticeable audio improvement everywhere with the 4K UHD releases over the standard Blu-ray versions.  Of course, you have to have good speakers and a good amp to fully appreciate this, but I think people with modest audio equipment will notice improvements as well.  Universal did do an excellent job with the audio.

All in all, it is a worthy addition, even if you already own the standard Blu-ray versions of these films.  Particularly since the 4K boxed set retails for less on Amazon than the standard Blu-ray boxed set, at least for now.  If I were interested in buying only one or two of the four Jurassic films in 4K (once they are available individually), I would pick Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, not only because of visual and audio quality but the best story lines, plots and acting.  However the entire set of four is a relative bargain when compared to how they will be priced individually.",1527724800,45,4451,4.609911054637865

Now, all four films have been remastered in 4K and presented in one box set. While some of the SFX in the earlier films do not hold up quite so well in ultra-hi-def, what's here looks utterly magnificent with exceptional color fidelity and clarity. Great stuff from Uni this time around. Let's hope its part of a renewed trend toward quality for a studio whose traditional Blu-ray output has been exceptionally spotty at best.",1527724800,,537,4.977777777777778

There have been some newer UHD 4k releases that look embarrassingly terrible; full of ""linen-effect"" digital noise especially in the shadows (iso jacked all the way up, etc), inconsistent quality, blurry image, terrible digital grain etc. This one is NOT one of those transfers. Each film looks amazing. I sat about 7ft. away from my 65"" display just to pick apart the details on screen. HDR really looks wonderful and the aspect ratio fills up the display really well.

7013831,3,B00TPL8DXQ,"So instead of being the first to submit a 5 star review on release day for just 1 watched movie, I decided to watch all 4 movies to form an opinion on my review.
This review is for the video quality of the 4K 25th Anniversary Collection... I already have all 4 in blu-ray format, and this is my take on whether it's worth it to buy this set. My TV is a LG 65"" OLED65C7P, calibrated, with sound outputted through a Denon AVRX4300H
First of all, if you're a die hard fan of the series, then just get it to say you have the 25th anniversary edition in 4K.
JP1 - Video quality compared to BR is 50/50. 50% being better, 50% being the same.
JP2 - Video quality compared to BR is 80/20. A lot more content had that ""4k pop""
JP3 - Video quality compared to BR is 95+/5. Most of the movie could pass as being produced recently in the 4K format. Movie content was more of a 2 star, as I did not find it that exciting. So kind of a waste of the 4K quality as I probably won't watch it as often as 1, 2 & 4
JPW - It's just plain horrible... 4K it ain't. In no manner what so ever. This abomination is worth asking for a refund and waiting for the first 3 to be released independently for purchase. A 25 year old movie converted to 4K with some graininess is acceptable. However a movie shot just a few years ago should not have way more graininess than it's 25 year old predecessor. For now, JPW is best on plain blu-ray.

In my opinion, if you have the DVD edition of these movies, it's worth the upgrade. If you have the set on blu-ray, not so much. For me, it was having the 25th Anniversary edition on 4K, which I'm seriously considering returning for a refund, mainly due to the crap 4K quality of Jurassic World. It's that bad... My opinion of the JW movie is 5 stars, so I was initially excited that I was going to experience it in 4K.",1527206400,81,1831,4.058011049723757
7013832,5,B00TPL8DXQ,Love this series and it contained ALL the movies!,1527206400,,49,4.555555555555555
7013833,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"I greatly enjoyed this 4K version with the Dolby X soundtrack.  The audio with X made it a totally immersive experience.  I felt at times as though I was there.  I don't generally get frightened watching a movie but I have to tell you that I was generally concerned at times for my safety:).  The DTS X soundtrack is amazing.  The 4K video was substantially better than the the 2K video version for me also.  Though my review is based only on the first movie as I haven't had time to see the others yet.  For me, the soundtrack makes it a worthwhile purchase.  As well as the added benefit of the 4K upgrade.",1527120000,6,608,4.271929824561403

7013837,1,B00TPL8DXQ,"Very disappointed only watched Jurassic Park in 4K and fooled around with the Blu-ray extra content disc so far and I am not impressed. 4K wise its better than original but nowhere near the quality of other 4K discs and I suspect its cause they did a lazy upscale instead of a full conversion. The previous reviewer stated that older films cant look as good but I don't believe that. Jurassic Park came out in 1993 and  Saving Private Ryan came out in 1998. 4k disc wise Saving Private Ryan came out only a few weeks before this set yet is superior in every way. You could easily take someone who had never seen Saving Private Ryan and play the 4K version and make them believe the film came out in 2018 because of how good it looks and also it has Dolby Vision and Atmos support making the battle scenes seem like you really are there it is an event within itself. Than there is Jurassic Park which looks like a slightly better blue ray quality and there is no Dolby Atmos or Vision support which is incredibly lazy. I can only imagine  hearing the T. Rex or later I. Rex roar coming from in front of and on top of me, but sadly this cant happen. The blue ray/extra content disc was even more disappointing. This is because if you play around with the settings on it you can find where it advertises PlayStation 3 controller support and heavily advertises a remote companion app which hasn't been updated in 2 years and won't work on any modern os. They seemingly took the blue ray disc from a much older release and simply painted a new image on it doing no updating on it what so ever.. If somehow the other discs blow me away 4K wise Ill gladly raise the raiting by 1-2 stars but I highly doubt it seeing how lazy they were with their biggest film in this set and no discs show Atmos or Vision support. Do not recommend anyone buy this it is a lazy attempt by Universal to make more money with the 4K update.",1526947200,5,1912,4.279005524861878
7013838,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"This is a stunningly beautiful 4K transfer of Jurassic Park. I have owned various versions of these franchise movies in all formats including available 3D. I started by purchasing Jurassic Park on release day of the original laser disc years ago and have seen varying transfers through the years with ascending formats. I was hesitant when I preordered this set for fear I would be disappointed with the transfer as I am with the 4K release of Die Hard. But I would absolutely recommend anyone to upgrade their collection without fear. Jurassic Park is truly remarkable in its 4K presentation. We all must remember that 4K does not magically change a transfer beyond what the original film maker desired and in this case, Mr. Spielberg does not disappoint. It contains a DTS-X sound  track as well. I viewed this on a 4K 65 inch OLED display and have no hesitation to say to anyone sitting on the fence about this, you will not be disappointed.  I do not say this lightly as I am not a fan who says I love it, no matter what and it's 4K so it has to be great. That said, I have zero regrets and finally have a near demo quality version for my collection. You will find no better version of any movie of this age than this 4K Jurassic Park release. I waited a long time for this and now I have it.

7013839,2,B00TPL8DXQ,"I'm not going to say anything about the movie itself, I think at this point we all know this is a great film. The 4k version however, is incredibly poorly done. Scenes are blurry. They seem to have focused on only upscaling the focus of each scene rather than everything, and it shows. This doesn't have an atmos soundtrack. Everything about this screams that the studio is just trying to make money on a half done 4k rehash. As far as I'm concerned JP2, 3, and JW might as well not exist, I bought this solely for the original. I would not do so again.",1526947200,2,553,4.276190476190476

Also this was after I got the box set and realize I order the version that comes with  only 3 movies. I thought the cheaper price was the lack of 3d. I guess not because the first one still came with the 3d version. That is useless because I don't own a 3d t.v. So label it next time Amazon. Please!",1517097600,3,886,3.868131868131868

However, it came back as an additional copy of The Lost World, so I don't have a digital copy of that movie.  Amazon's only solution was to have me repackage and return the whole set and wait for a replacement, as the digital copies are apparently not their problem but a ""complimentary"" addition to the set.

7013980,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"***Updated***- Digital Code Problem Resolved and review below updated to reflect that

I received all 4 movies on blu ray and the 1st and 4th movies in 3d as advertised.  I've seen a couple other reviews say they got shorted discs. There must be some older SKU's of this mixed in that didn't have Jurassic World yet.  If you get one just return it to Amazon as defective and get a new one.

Its a nice looking box set, I like how they've done it with the scenes from the movie on each page.  Definitely a lot more effort put into this than a lot of other bargain box sets I've seen over the years.  I mean its less than $50 so don't expect too much.  I would recommend maybe adding some thin sleeves to your discs to protect them from the cardboard if you can as that could be a concern.  None of my discs had any scratch marks on them.

I did have an issue with one of the included digital codes (Jurassic Park III).  The code wouldn't work on vudu and when i took it straight to Ultraviolet it was coming up as Lost World.  I put a ticket in with UV Support and they had me send them a picture of my code sheet.  They ended up forwarding it to Universal Support, who sent me a working code within 24 hours.  So despite the problem it was resolved pretty quickly and to my satisfaction.  I've seen a few others who have had this exact problem with the digital code in the reviews so make sure you pursue that with Ultraviolet  Customer Support so you get your full value out of this set.",1499904000,,1488,4.153846153846154
7013981,1,B00TPL8DXQ,Very upset that I just opened up the box and the Jurassic World blu-ray and 3D discs are just cardboard placeholders for when the movies come out in 2015...ummm it July of 2017....it says on the inserts sold separately.....I could have found the trilogy for cheaper....I was going for all 4 movies with this...very disappointed.,1499644800,5,328,4.9818181818181815

I went from this page and selected Blu-ray format without reading that it was a different set. Disappointed because I don't feel I got a good value. Could have picked these up in the Walmart 7.98 Blu-ray bin and paid less and had better cases. Also, cardboard book type case that discs slide into like envelopes. All in all,  i'd look for each of the movies separately rather than buying this set.

7013996,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"This collection is a must for Jurassic Park fans. It's also a must have if you have a toddler obsessed with dinosaurs and needs to see them every waking hour.
 Am I a terrible parent for letting my young child watch PG-13 movies? Possibly, but that isn't what we're talking about here.
 We're talking about an amazing box set with 3D versions of the first and fourth movies. The set comes in a cardboard folio, with excellent cinema pics to distinguish between movies, and is covered by a textured cardboard dust cover. Both of which are trashed because my baby raptor needs to carry the collection around for 20 minutes before deciding which movie he decides the rest of the pack (us) will watch.
 The movie collection also comes with digital copies of the movies, which is awesome. I suggest redeeming the movies through Flixter. Flixter has a way to download the movies with their app so you can take them on the go.
 That way, the tyrant of a child has them at all times on a tablet that looks like a gyrosphere after being attacked by an Indominus Rex. Ultra violet doesn't have their own way to download directly from them, nor do several other options you can redeem with, except iTunes and the occasional choice of Google play.
 This collection is priced very well considering all the extra content you get with it. If you're into all that ""behind the scenes"" chum.
The box is cool!
The digital copies are a great bonus.
The 3D movies, in addition to the regular ones, are a nice option to enjoy and experience in a different way.
I'm sure you'll be pleased with your purchase as long as it doesn't arrive on your doorstep looking like a T-Rex trampled on it.",1495756800,,1667,4.524916943521594

Second movie - Just OK.  Your typical rushed sequel.

Third movie - Pretty terrible.

Fourth movie - Another good movie.  Not as great as the original, but definitely a good move that could stand on its own.

If you don't have $20 to spend on something you LOVE... then there is also something wrong with you.

We watch these movies probably once a year. I love them. Yes it's a dumb idea. Yes everything always go wrong and the dinosaurs go a muck. And yes its FREAKING AMAZING and super enjoyable. It's a movie people. Not an actual idea on shark tank. Its fun and I love it and I love that now I can watch them whenever. But I really love that it was so cheap.

I would like to contact someone about this but I have no idea who to get ahold of.,1481155200,3,346,4.028985507246377
7014198,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"A must have for any Jurassic Park fan.

Seeing the original in 3D was like seeing it in the theater all over again. The 3D in Jurassic World is very good, clean, and has great depth. The original is a 3D conversion. Best I've seen to date, but as always, it's not as good as natively shot 3D.

Took off a star because when I bought it, it was advertised as the 3D collection. However, only the original film and World are 3D. Jurassic Park 2 and 3 are NOT 3D, which was a disappointment.",1481155200,2,487,4.11578947368421

Great action and suspense, great special effects that doesn't get old or overused.
Great Quality Discs and bonuses and all that for a low low price!
It's even lower than one ticket for an adult evening 3-D viewing and popcorn.
Back in the days a VHS would cost $80 that's why many people rented (or pirated).",1481155200,,394,4.8088235294117645

Four digital codes are great! I had an issue with two codes only wanting to redeem Jurassic Park III but ultraviolet/Universal squared it away and emailed me a working code.  Great value! Amazing Movies!  Nothing like watching Jurassic Park on my 65' 4K tv with the surround sound shaking my living room as the T-Rex approaches!!!,1480636800,,488,4.5227272727272725

7014237,5,B00TPL8DXQ,These are great movies (except #2) and this set was a great deal. The 3D is great and the casing and everything is well done. The 3D for Jurassic World is really well done and is the kind of movie 3D was made for.  You can tell they put a lot of effort into that aspect of the film and it makes it worth watching over and over to catch different 3D aspects you missed the first time through!

7014337,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"My wife and I have both enjoyed the Jurassic Park films separately, and together.  Then, one day we decided to have a Jurassic Park marathon, so we ordered this three-in-one DVD collection as well as Jurassic World.

We started with the original Jurassic Park film, and watched them in order, ending with the newest installment, Jurassic World, which is our least favorite.  The first three films are the best, as far as we're concerned.

Perhaps that is mostly because of t nostalgia.  I used to play various video games bases on Jurassic Park.  My wife has always loved going to dinosaur theme parks and attractions.

Personally, I can't decide which is my favorite.  They are all heartwarming tales of adventure, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal.  They all have a certain element of Democratic liberalism, in that they show capitalists as selfish and evil, or at the very least, careless, clumsy, and stupid.",1468540800,,912,4.986754966887418

7014356,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"It's confusing how these companies put out different packages with the same movies.  This one includes four discs: all three movies plus the extra 3D copy of Jurassic Park.
I've watched all 3 movies and noticed no problems, the transfers are all good.
The sound is good and they are all subtitled with English SDH.

The one thing I don't like is the cardboard packaging.  Ever since CDs came out I've not touched the playing surface and only handle them by the edges but these slide into a book and you can't get them out without grabbing the little bit of exposed disc.  And if you happen to get some dirt in the tight slot the disc fits in it will scratch every time it goes in or out.  I wish they had a cutout so you could push the discs out by the center hole.
They included empty places to put 2 Jurassic World discs but I'd rather keep them in the regular case.",1467158400,,868,4.236363636363636

Ignoring whether or not you liked the 2nd and 3rd movie, for the price getting the bluray and 3d bluray discs for the 1st and 4th Jurassic World movie made it worth it. Also, I expected some simple last minute 3d effects from the original movie remade in 3D, and was pleasantly surprised. I think that the 3D from the first jurassic park does a better job at 3D than some of the newer movies I've bought in the last 2 years in my opinion.

7014471,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"Got this as a fantastic lightning deal months ago and have watched them all NUMEROUS times since then. My family loves the Jurassic Park movies but I got this specifically for my daughter, the biggest fan of us all lol. The case itself is beautiful, like a book. It feels sturdy and safe. Upon opening you see that there is beautiful pictures from each film accompanying each of the individual movies. I did not bother to take pictures as I saw that one reviewer already took detailed pictures of each page. Anyways, she absolutely loved this. It is such a nice case. What a spectacular boxed set; all 4 of the movies on Blu-ray PLUS JP in 3D and JW in 3D? And it includes codes to watch them ALL digitally!!

 Before buying this set I had never seen The Lost World or JP3 on Blu-ray and let me say that they look incredible. It's amazing what they can do with picture & sound restoration. I already owned JP on Blu-ray & both copies are beautiful. Really takes your breath away when you've only watched the first 2 on VHS! They really did an amazing job with these.

  There is an incredible amount of special features included with each movie/disc. Hours worth of behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, storyboards, and interviews with cast members. It is VERY cool to watch all of these after finishing the movies. My daughter watches all 4 movies at least biweekly. So this was definitely a great investment lol. If you or someone you know loves the series; this is THE set to own. I had no problems whatsoever with discs being scratched, or items missing.

7014474,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"All of the Jurassic Park movies to date which can be watched individually or as a binge.

Cast members from the first movie are interspersed in the others, with references to what happened in each giving continuity to the plot(s). Each one has the old theme played out in those classic horror movies--""there are some things man is not supposed to know""--in this case the fact that cloning a dinosaur is a very bad idea, which no one ever takes to heart. If they did, we wouldn't have this great series!

There are a few questions still unanswered, even at this late date...such as (kind of a SPOILER) what happened to the pterodactyls who escaped in #3. Are they waiting in the wings to swoop[ down on us from somewhere in the Yucatan jungles, perhaps?

Anyone who loves dinosaurs (and that probably includes most of the child population) will love these movie though it probably won't be advisable for the much younger viewing audience unless they're old enough to differentiate between real and make-believe.

This set was purchased from amazon and also each movie was viewed at a theater. No remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1460678400,,1151,4.768844221105527

7014555,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"My grandson is obsessed with dinosaurs but there's only so many times you can watch 'Walking with Dinosaurs' or 'Planet Dinosaur' I previously had just one of these films, the third one, not because it's the best film because in my opinion it's the weakest one, but my friend ordered it from American when it first came out and it wouldn't play on her DVD player so she gave it to me. Anyway I tried my grandson with it and he loved it and it made such a nice change so I decided to order the complete set, after all they're films which have stood the test of time and I'd not seen the new film 'Jurassic World'
Delivery was very quick, it comes in one box with two cases inside, the three older films are in one case with the new one on its own. The only issue I had was one of the holding grips on the three case was broken on arrival which means it's very difficult to get the middle disk to stay in place but apart from that all is good.
Most people I would imagine will have already seen the first three films at some point, out of the three the first one is the best in my opinion.
My favourite out of the set has to be the latest one 'Jurassic World' this could be partly because it's new and of course the dinosaurs are amazing because it is ultimately just a remake of the original, same idea, same mistakes and while I must admit I wouldn't have actually gone to see this film I did enjoy it way more than I expected on DVD.
This set is good value, well unless you already have the other films I suppose but in my case it's worked out well and I'm so glad I decided to purchase.",1455840000,,1588,4.07667731629393

7014560,4,B00TPL8DXQ,"Overall, the set is great. The case is made of the typical high-gloss thick paper. I haven't had any problems playing the discs. The only thing I don't care for is a little insert on the top/front of the case. It sticks out a bit, but I just used some rubber glue to fix the minor issue. Great franchise, a classic growing up as the first film was released as I turned 13. It was the first movie I saw in the theaters that was PG-13, so there's certainly some sentimental bias going on.",1455667200,,486,4.180851063829787

7014591,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"After the summer blockbuster that was Jurassic World, it was only a matter of months before DreamWorks released a DVD / Blu-Ray package of all 4 dinosaur movies in this franchise.  And it came out just in time for Christmas 2015, with it on sale at certain stores and here on Amazon for $29.99, which is the price I paid for it.  This package comes with six Blu-Ray discs; sorry no DVD or Digital versions...  The six discs are a 2D version for each movie, plus a 3-D version of Jurassic World and the original Jurassic Park.  I have yet to watch the two 3-D movies, but the 4 discs containing the individual 2-D movies themselves makes this purchase worthwhile.  Each of the 2-D discs comes fully loaded with extra features such as interviews, additional / deleted scenes, along with the feature film.  The movies themselves looked great on the small screen; with great audio and visual special effects, and sub-titles in multiple languages.  Granted, in a couple of years this package will become redundant once the next film in the franchise is released, but for now this is the perfect addition to any fan of Spielberg, Michael Crichton, or dinosaur movies in general",1454889600,2,1171,4.71078431372549

Looked at the bottom of the disc to find that it had deep scratches in it.  If you look at the inside of the case, there is one of those security plastic tags where the first disc sits that scratches in the exact location.  Love the movies, can't say much about the company that made the box set.

PRICE: I bought this during Black Friday and at LARGE discounted price so I am not sure I would be the owner of this at the normal selling price. I love Jurassic Park (who doesn't though?) but not sure I would shell out $90 for this. If you do, however, you will NOT be disappointed. Sometimes you have to splurge.

QUALITY: The quality is great! Much nicer than I expected. The booklet has a page for each movie and the pictures are really cool. Also, the last page has the year when each movie was made so that was pretty cool.

7014853,2,B00TPL8DXQ,"Received this for Christmas and jumped on the chance to watch Jurassic World for the first time! It was sadly not enjoyable as the movie skipped along making me miss dialogue and ruining action scenes. The Blu-Ray would also pause, struggle, then speed ahead in fast motion and at odd times. We've never had such difficulty watching discs on our Blu-Ray player with out TV/audio system so my first thought is it has to be the disc. Upon closer inspection the disc is clear and scratch free, not sure what the issue is. We watched a movie on the player the night before, an old disc, that played just fine. Unimpressed with the quality of this disc. So far I've only watched Jurassic World, haven't tried any of the other movies and won't be able to try the 3D versions yet (we don't have a 3D TV yet), so cannot comment on those. However, the issue with the Jurassic World disc has made me afraid to see what the others will do as it has taken away from the quality of the film.",1451001600,2,978,4.3497267759562845

7014882,2,B00TPL8DXQ,"First off, I bought this gift set for $24 over Black Friday.  I really just wanted to see Jurassic World which sells for $19 by itself, while the other three movies sell for about $10 each.  So in my mind this was a deal to get the entire series for essentially the price of the new film.  I give this two stars for the Jurrasic World Film.  For the bundle price deal of getting all the movies that would be 5 stars.  I grew up with the original film and thought the movie was great.  I could have cared less for the the next two.  I knew from word on the street, Jurrasic World was pretty much a reboot of Jurrasic Park and even though there were some throw backs to the original it was pretty much stand alone.  So the movie as a whole sucks.  First off this movie starts with the theme park already built.  Wait...the first movie was trying to open and get the park endorsed and that failed.  The second film tried to bring the park to the mainland and that failed.  The third film was a fluke, but in Jurrasic World, the theme park is already open, has a few years under its belt, and is thieving.  Like I mentioned, it draws upon themes from the original but, big plot hole, what the heck happened that allowed the park to be a success which failed the first two times.  Basically, here are my thoughts.  This movie is a metaphorical representation of what Hollywood is doing and did with this franchise:  Hollywood, ""How can I make more money?"", in the movie, ""How can we make more money,"" Hollywood, ""We can remake and milk the Jurrasic Park films because it has been so long a new generation of people are two dumb to know what is good."" In the movie, ""Lets make a new park with new dinosaurs to make more money to a new generation of people because enough time has passed and people are two dumb to know what is good for them.""  Sorry for the spoilers.  The movie even leaves and ending open for sequel, which I will say right now will not be worth watching.  So in the end this movie is a movie about Hollywood just disguised as a movie.  In fact, when I think about the movie this way, I enjoy it more.  Still worth a rental but not worth paying full price for unless you can find a similar deal as to what is above.",1450310400,,2227,4.192941176470589

7014971,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"LOVE the 3D version. We saw Jurassic World in the theaters in 2D and when we saw it in 3D at home I picked up on so much more of the story line and visual details that I had missed. Love watching ""Star Lord"" play his role as the anchor in the otherwise ""other worldly"" feel that picks up so well where the originals left off. So many people unaware or caught up in their roles that they forget to pay attention to what is all around them.

The collection is great. The pages and discs are well organized and illustrated. It has a nice look and feel to the set. 5 star quality. Love it.",1449360000,2,585,4.043103448275862

7014996,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"What an amazing collection of what the world would have looked like if genetic designed extinct animals were suddenly thrust into today's modern society.  I am sure it would have been exciting along with being extremely terror filled day to day living.  I truly like the progression from the 1st Jurassic Park to Jurassic World to see the new creatures emerge and their fight to co-exist with terrified mankind.  What seemed a flash in the pan to some critics it has proven to be seen by numerous thousands no millions on a yearly basis.  I was one of the original doubters, but all changed when I got caught up with all the effort the producers put into making each film unique on its own and as a series.  I am thrilled to have the complete collection to date, but as others are wondering will there be another Jurrasic themed film for all of us to become excited about.",1449273600,,872,4.493670886075949

The downside with this collection is that the discs are in cardboard sleeves so any dirt is going to get to mess with the reading surface of the disc.

This is why my review gets only 4 stars.",1449187200,,416,4.215189873417722
7015003,5,B00TPL8DXQ,Great gift to get and has all of the Jurassic Park movies and the newest one included with other extras,1449187200,,103,4.2
7015004,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"The boxed collection is actually much better quality than I had anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised. The logo on the boxed sleeve is raised and has a nice finish. Even the scales have a texture on them on the cover. The book inside is very solid and the discs do not move in the sleeves. They do not come with cases, or even a plastic keep sleeve to snap on the discs. They simply sit between the cardboard sleeves. Other reviewers have said they have received the discs badly scratched, but all of my discs were absolutely pristine with no scratching.

We have been adding to our Blu-Ray collection for years and the Jurassic Park collection is a great staple piece. I love the fact that we also were given Digital HD codes for each of the four movies, since we have been building up our Vudu library online as well. I think at this price you get a tremendous value for the money. A lovely case, a book, four films and a 3D copy of one, as well as four digital HD codes.

Jurassic Park has been one of those series that always induce awe for me. The first film came out when I was very, very young, and I remember quite vividly the memories I have watching it in the theater. There is a great sense of nostalgia owning this collection, and for anyone else who has grew up watching these films, this collection is a perfect purchase.",1449187200,16,1337,4.344

7015007,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"Love Jurassic Park, the others are a mixed bag.  They're all exciting and generally good popcorn flicks.  I work on the computer and I like to have the TV on as background noise.  It's pretty cool to take a quick break and look up to see someone getting eaten by a dinosaur.  ""oh, there's Newman, and he's ...oh, that's that.""  :)  This and the Tremors and Underworld series is always solid to have on in the background.  I have netflix and a bunch of old dvds ripped onto a hard drive, but you just can't beat a good blu-ray movie on standby (I don't have 3D or 4K, but I think those are at least a couple years away from being worth it).

I have a set of the first 3 Jurassic Park movies on dvd and watched all the special features and stuff there.  I have no idea if they've changed any for the blu-ray release.  I also have no interest in 3D.  It gives me a headache and so I pooh pooh the included 3D copies of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World.  But, that's my preference.",1449100800,,977,4.138297872340425

Jurassic Park-Steven Spielberg's Crown Jewel of a Block Buster  changed the  face  of  visual effects  driven  cinema  for  better  and  for  worse
  and still  one  of the best  films  of the last 20 years The 3D  is  really  great  too!

The Lost World: Jurassic Park- I don't  care  what  people say  i  love  this  movie!

Jurassic Park 3- Yes  its garbage  but  i  like  watching  it  every once in a while its  a  guilty pleasure nuff said.

Jurassic World- I already reviewed  this  film  so  i  won't  go  into  great  detail, The  subplots  are  stupid,  most  of the  characters  are  uninteresting  especially  the  kids  but  this  movie  is  a  helluva lot  of fun! I just  watched  the 3D edition of jurassic world last night and  i  was really  pleased with  the  results. The depth  of field  is  was  really  well  executed it  really  felt  like  among  these  amazing creatures,  especially  the  helicopter  shot  of the  island  really  gave  this  feeling  of  flight,  it  was  a  nice  3D experience.",1446076800,,1044,4.541176470588235

You need a 3d tv to play the 3d disc so i don't know how that works. I thought that you got 3d versions of all three movies not just jurassic park 1 but thats not the case. Its great that there are two blank spaces fot jurrasic world. Im gonna get the blue ray disk of it and leave the 3d slot open for when the next one comes out.,1437091200,,447,3.817204301075269

For the price, getting TWO copies of JURASSIC PARK (one standard, one in 3D), plus THE LOST WORLD and JURASSIC PARK III, is bargain. JP III might not be the great film ever, but its certainly watchable if you are a fan of the franchise. If not, I recommend buying the individual films that you wish.

7015305,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"First of all this is an awesome series of the best dinosaur movies ever made. Great for a long trip or a weekend that is rained out or snowed in this will please any dino lovers movie appetite. I know this because I love dino movies and this series is the best done series as far as acting and graphics go. The dinos in these movies are so realistic I felt like I was actually watching real dinosaurs. The acting is phenomenal and the movies are just an all-around success. These are a must see for anyone.
JURASSIC PARK:
The movie that started it all. here financial giant john Hammond builds a theme park on remote island for tourists to see real dinos that have been genetically created by scientists who got their dna from prehistoric mosquitoes that have dino dna inside them. Then Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, mathematician Ian Malcolm and his investor's attorney, Donald Gennaro, must go on a tour of the park first so that Dr. Hammond can open with the approval of scientists. Without their approval there is no park opening. John shows them all around and you see some beautiful dinos that are done so well they look real. After the tour takes its start a problem occurs and the dinos get lose and are now hunting everyone on the island. The acting is awesome with real character behind the characters. There is much more to this movie however I do not want to spoil it for anyone who has not seen it so I end there.
THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (II)
The action continues as mathematician Ian Malcolm is forced back to the dinos onto Isla Sorna because his girlfriend dr. Sarah Harding has gone to the island as a part of a team. This team meets up with John Hammonds Nephews team who is there to capture the dinos and start another park. Things go terribly wrong and raptors slice back into everyones nightmares. Then ingen (Hammonds Company) captures one and brings it to the us I will not go any further other than to tell you this movie is awesome with great graphics and acting as well.
JURRASIC PARK III
Dr Grant heads back to the dinos in this one as a wealthy business man Paul Kirby persuades him with tons of money to give them a tour of the island. Little does grant know he is actually there as a guide to find Paul son on isla sorna an island he has never been on.  As this is ingens second island for free roaming dinos. Things go wrong and they get stuck on the island in search of a boy who was marooned there as well. Dr Grant just wants to get off and that is where I will end so that I do not spoil the movie for anyone who has not seen it.  Well done graphics just as you would expect form the Jurassic movies and great acting.
JURASSIC WORLD:
This movie blockbuster delivers far above the expected hype!!! Jurassic park is no more and now the new Masrani Corporation has taken it over and turned it into Jurassic World. Some of the remnants from the other Jurassic park movies can be seen in parts of this movie which was a real treat. The Misrani corp needs to wow people because they became tired of dinosaurs so they make a hybrid dino (the Indominus Rex) which becomes a big mistake. I am not going to spoil the movie so that is enough for that subject. The story is very familiar to the first Jurassic park (and just as awesome if not better) as Claire, the busy park operations manager, is visited by her two nephews and is not spending much time with them as they wonder around the park. Then a catastrophe happens and everyone runs for their lives because of the newly created dino. That is when Owen (former military man and animal expert) steps up and uses his skills to save everyone and there is even a bit of a love story between Clair and Owen seen blossoming. It is everything you would expect from one of the Jurassic Movies and then some more.",1435104000,21,3792,4.346967559943582

I love all three and am really hoping and praying the fourth will be amazing .  This is about the blu Rays themselves.  First off you get the first one in 3d which is pointless if you don't have a 3d TV.  But that's in the product descriptions so get it if you want.  I got this because the packaging looked cool and I don't have these on blu ray so I figured why not .  Anyways, the problems I had were with the first Jurassic park blu Ray. The movie would not play for some strange reason.  I would get past the previews then just a black screen .  Which was really annoying cause I was so excited .  It works now but I don't know how it got fixed, it just decided to work . Also the fourth slot for the new movie is rather pointless because you still have to buy the blu Ray and put the disc in that slot.  So why not just keep it in its original case. Idk maybe I'm wrong.  Anyways now that they all work they look good and the pictures inside the are are pretty cool.  That's why I gave it four stars.  Great movies just have had some problems but whatevs.  Life finds a way! :)",1433635200,13,1212,3.9300411522633745
7015329,5,B00TPL8DXQ,When I heard about this box set I decided to buy it so that I can sell my other discs of the Jurassic Park franchise.  The box is well made and I like the additional spaces that are reserved for Jurassic World and Jurassic World 3D.  If you want to get all the movies in this franchise this box set is the way to accomplish that.,1432771200,3,329,3.9696969696969697

8702491,5,B00TPL8DXQ,"I already had digital HD copies but when I saw the 4K set go on sale for $35 on PrimeDay, I snagged it up.  I've gone thru all 4 UHD 4K discs.  These new 4K versions of the originals are really good.  The first two movies do look a little grainy and the special effects ""aged"", but I think that should be expected with how old those movies are.  With that said, the DTS:X audio is really good on them and a definite bonus to your bluray copies.  There are many scenes (particularly in 1 & 2) with a lot of new overhead surrounds.  The DTS:X is also louder.  The only poor performance with overheads was on the newer Jurassic World copy, there wasn't really anything up top going on.",1534723200,,682,4.2
