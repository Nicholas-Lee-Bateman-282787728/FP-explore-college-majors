3447130,4,B001AD6UIC,"50's Sci-Fi is a special breed...most today think it hokey and fake.  Well, yes, but since they didn't have CGI etc it's pretty darn good.  Movie uses alot of footage from another film..Destination Moon.  Has good story, involving lust, politics, power struggles, disaster, etc so all the elements from today's movies are there....just with a 50's spin.",1337644800,2,353,5.157894736842105
3447131,3,B001AD6UIC,"DVD: : Sinister Cinema 83629 53480
Image quality: Very good
Genre stars worth noting: John Agar; Cecil Kellaway; Robert Cornthwaite
Extras: Trailer for ""The Unearthly""

Surprisingly entertaining TV pilot for a never-made series in 1959. The theme of bureaucrats and cost-cutting vs. exploring space as a continuation of good old American know-how was quite effective, though I can see how it would bore some. Well-acted. Special effects were good seeing as how they all came from George Pal's ""Conquest of Space"" as noted by others. You've probably heard of ""police procedural"" movies; this was a pretty well done ""space station procedural"".",1334620800,2,641,5.346534653465347
3447132,3,B001AD6UIC,"The plot is decent, if you like scientists against the burecrats. Much of the special scenes are from 'Conquest of space, A real super classic.",1334534400,,143,4.76
3447133,1,B001AD6UIC,"I thought this was a feature-length movie. It's a TV job, and not a good one at that. Some of the scenes I've seen used in other movies. At 55-yrs-old, I'm a huge fan of mid-century black-and-white sci-fi films, even bad ones, but this thing is boring, short, & just kinda ends all of a sudden. It's not worth watching.",1331596800,6,319,4.333333333333333
3447134,5,B001AD6UIC,Destination Space is a reproduction of a program originally shown on television about the beginning of space exploration. The cast is top notch and I would definitely recommend this program to others. It shows the emotions experienced by both the crew and the family members left back on earth.,1329436800,,294,5.020408163265306
3447135,3,B001AD6UIC,"When I saw Conquest Of Space and first listened to the majestic music, it seemed I had died and gone to heaven along with poor Ross Martin. It's still the single most mysteriously beautiful thing I ever saw in a science fiction film, and I've seen two or three. This appears to be a failed TV pilot but you will enjoy watching genre stalwarts Harry Townes and John Agar cavorting in the suits and its fun to match the black and white footage with that of the feature. They are not bad bookends.",1321056000,,494,4.32258064516129
3447136,3,B001AD6UIC,"This is a quite well written tv episode (pilot that never took off?) of the building of the first lunar rocket from orbit.  The footage of the space station and vehicles was all taken from ""The Conquest of Space"", but the actors are all original and some well known.  It was a pity that this did not see a wider audience and at least a season of episodes.

Note that this is B&W and has the original Maxwell House adverts as part of the program.

Not a great value for the price, but certainly an interesting curio that was worth watching.",1241913600,28,539,4.306930693069307
3447137,4,B001AD6UIC,"Destination Space is a real sleeper, I was expecting an average silly run of the mill, 1950's ""B"" space movie plot line but boy did I get a surprise. This obscure unsold TV pilot film takes a very realistic approach to presenting the hazards of space travel and the difficulties the space agency has on justifing their expensive expenditures. I especially found this a unique viewing experience since I work in aerospace logistics for the government myself. This film hit home for me and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a dramatic space story that is trying to be as credible as possible for its time. There are no ray gun fights, marauding hostile aliens or rampaging creatures here. Just decent acting, good drama and above average visuals (thanks to the use of stock footage from George Pal's ""Conquest of Space"" mixed with original footage done for this film), in an effort to tell the story of the first space station to be built in earths orbit.
I highly recommend this little known gem and give it 4 out of 5 stars.",1239753600,60,1045,4.593582887700535
3447138,1,B001AD6UIC,"Short, no plot, no action very bad acting. This is one of those movies that leaves you hanging and if you blink you have missed the movie. Don't throw away you hard earned money.",1401235200,,178,4.264705882352941
3447139,5,B001AD6UIC,"Destination Space has an innocent originality (captured on film) that's refreshing. Yes, ""Avatar"", ""Iron Man"" and a bevy of other new-age flicks have their good points. I'll take an old space movie any time over the new ones. Let your imagination fly to space.",1374537600,,260,4.931818181818182
3447140,5,B001AD6UIC,"The DVD was better quality than the instant video.

However, the DVD has a continuous on-screen logo superimposed over the move throughout its entire length. This was a major disappointment and a distraction from the movie which I generally enjoyed.

I have ordered other movies from Sinister Cinema and they normally have there logo go away after about 5 min. I recommend Destination Space but try to find another source.",1372291200,3,422,5.014285714285714
3447141,5,B001AD6UIC,The quality was good and the availability was easy. Thanks for quick service and easy ordering. Any more of the 1950's Sci-Fi movies becoming available will be great.,1370995200,,166,4.964285714285714
3447142,5,B001AD6UIC,"When I watched ""Destination Space"" It was like watching it when I was young. I had felt it would not be enjoyable because of all the recent space movies but I had a blast watching it.",1370822400,3,183,4.111111111111111
3447143,3,B001AD6UIC,"A movie for dyed-in-the-wool space buffs.  While not ""truly awful,"" as are some lower-end space sagas, a grade ""B"" is on the generous side. It helps to know that this was created as a pilot for a television series ... which was never completed.
The movie uses sequences from George Pal's unique flop, Conquest of Space; and obviously, the title ""Destination Space"" is a merger of two Pal movies (Destination Moon and Conquest of Space). Although the technical details are reasonably good for the era (1959), outright goofy sequences are also present. Consider the sequence in which astronauts are towed behind a space tug while holding ropes, and the tug's rocket engine is blasting right at them! There is also a sequence where astronauts jump off from a space ship toward the space station a hundred meters or so away. How are they going to brake their impact? And what if they miss? George Pal was a strong believer in atomic propulsion for space exploration ... which turned out not to be essential ... and in fact has not happened yet.
A side plot involves a congressman who questions the utility of the giant-rotating-wheel  space station ... a concept strongly championed by von Braun. In the movie he is the ""wrecker"" threatening the project. In retrospect, it seems the congress man was right ...  the giant space wheel, while nice, is simply too expensive. Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is the developing love triangle. ... and that says a lot.",1367798400,4,1471,4.8063241106719365
3447144,4,B001AD6UIC,"If you like 50's movies, you'll enjoy this one, it's one i hadn't seen, and it will be added to my collection.",1365811200,,110,4.045454545454546
3447145,2,B001AD6UIC,"If you like movies you can laugh at, this is one for you.  We have the movie ""Conquest of Space"",  The makers of ""Destination Space"" took a LOT of clips from Conquest and merged them into their movie.  The plot is supposed to be serious, but seeing all the clips from another movie makes it mostly laughable.  If you are expecting something serious, you will not like this.  But if you have seen Conquest of Space and want a laugh, this is the movie for you.",1365724800,,458,4.27906976744186
3447146,5,B001AD6UIC,"Interesting, seldom seen film. In step with its time.",1357257600,,53,5.0
3447147,5,B001AD6UIC,"It seems that things I saw as a lad are now being offered more and more (much to my delight).

The premise of the day (ala the needle nosed space ships) makes us think about what was ""certain"" knowledge then is now viewed through the lens of time.  The take away is - don't be so sure that ""certain"" is certain.

Whether the science was accurate or not isn't the point - the point is that it fired the imagination and fired up the brain.

This is Time Trip we can all take and view through our own lens.

In the meantime, enjoy the film for it's own sake.",1351728000,,555,4.055045871559633
8276907,4,B001AD6UIC,"It's truly amazing to me to read some of these reviews. Destination Space made in 1959 was far ahead of it's time. Well thought out material of brain power produced this. Sure, the travel from A-B is not possible in any Earthly space craft, but the true ingenuity of the problem solvers proves just how much smarter we were during this time period. If you are a collector, this is a must have.",1518998400,,393,4.397260273972603
