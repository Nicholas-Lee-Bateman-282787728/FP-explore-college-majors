1845446,4,B00008G8WA,"Of the Brainy Baby Series, Brainy Baby English is truly my favorite because it expands vocabulary. This is great however for the purpose of Art and even goes into detail on things I later learned in Art History like famous paintings and styles of art. Still my 14 month old enjoys watching it.

It is a fantastic Art DVD!",1166832000,2,321,4.440677966101695
1845447,5,B00008G8WA,I bought this for my 21 month old.  She has virtually all of the Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby series.  She learns so much from all of them.  This is no exception.  She requests it frequently and is identifying different lines and colors in everyday things.,1127260800,,257,4.521739130434782
1845448,5,B00008G8WA,"I purchased this DVD for my 2.5yr old son to add to his Brainy Baby collection. He absolutely adores this video! It teaches Primary colors, secondary colors, how new colors are made (red + blue = purple) and much more. It's colorful and of course there's soothing music played in the backround. This was an excellent buy and I'm sure we'll be watching this DVD for a while. You won't be disappointed!",1096675200,13,400,4.569444444444445
1845449,5,B00008G8WA,"We have several brainy baby videos, but this one really seems to have gotten my twins' attention. They are almost 2.5, one boy, one girl, and both adore this DVD. They call out for the ""painting"" DVD several times daily. The video opens some fairly sophisticated worlds for the kids, introducing them to the colors, different types of lines, and other media. Tasteful and clever animation, as well as other kid friendly devices (they love those umbrellas) resonate nicely with our little ones. For example, when the video demonstrates how two paints mixed together form a new color, my twins shout out the name of the new color being formed.
This is an excellent product, good for two year olds, that is effective and informative. Between this one and their ""animals"" DVD, we are pleased with the efforts of this company.",1082332800,22,821,4.829787234042553
7983433,5,B00008G8WA,My little one loves this.  It is quite long but surprisingly holds her attention (from she was just 2 years old).  She watches it while we are in the car. She already knew her colors but this helped to reinforce it.,1485561600,,215,4.219512195121951

7983440,5,B00008G8WA,"I have 4 children ages 2-6 and out of all the Brainy Baby series, this video is their favorite!  They are always asking ""Can we watch Art?"", and would watch it five times a day if I let them! I got them their own watercolors and they are duplicating what they see on the video, and explaining to me that they are ""drawing zigzags"" or that ""brown is a warm color"".  They love pointing out ""patterns"" on their pajamas and the wallpaper. The narrator asks questions to make it a fun interactive experience.  What I love most about Brainy Baby videos is the lovely background music and soothing narrator's voice.  There are no obnoxious voices or loud crashing around like many other children's films.  These videos are so much fun and I would say if I could only buy one of the Brainy Baby series, this would be my first choice.",1283126400,,825,4.437086092715232
7983441,4,B00008G8WA,"I bought several Brainy Baby DVD's for my 21 month old grandson for Christmas.  This one was my least favorite, but he seems equally entranced by all of them.",1264032000,,158,4.448275862068965
7983442,5,B00008G8WA,"I wondered whether a show about art could hold my son's interest, but it is done so well and teaches so many concepts it moves quickly and my son asks to watch it over and over. He is 2 and has learned about mediums, different line forms, primary and secondary colors, and several famous artists names. This is an excellent way to get your child interested in painting, coloring and playing with clay.",1167868800,4,401,4.506849315068493
