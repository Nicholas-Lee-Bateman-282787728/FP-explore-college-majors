7804314,5,6300182932,"Ah yes- Dan the man!  I saw this movie for the first time in recovery after a minor surgery.  I laughed so hard I dumped soup everywhere while my foot was elevated, (and laughed harder after that).  If you haven't seen this flick, you really should.  Dan plays a geeky professor who becomes a pimp, and competes for territory with a gangster named ""Mom.""  He bluffs ""Mom"" by assuming the persona of ""Doctor Detroit,"" in order to intimidate her into leaving him and his ""girls"" alone.  Light hearted silly comedy at it's best.  Trivia bit- the title track was done by DEVO, and Dan met a beautiful woman while making the film, and they were married shortly after that (She's the attractive blonde).

I still can't believe the total garbage out on DVD, when films such as this one sit waiting. PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD!!!",1102550400,2,821,4.575342465753424
7804315,2,6300182932,"Dan Ackroyd's first starring vehicle after the success of the original ""Saturday Night Live"" is a weak disjointed comedy wherein he plays a college professor who must pose as a mob boss. The scenes with a rival crime czar, a woman named 'Mom', are grotesque and funny but Ackroyd never fits comfortably in the role as he did in hundreds of SNL skits.",992822400,,350,4.571428571428571
7804316,5,6300182932,"""Doctor Detroit"" is a comedy that will take many fans back to the glorious days of the early 1980's, when disco was in its' dying stages  and comedy stars from television's ""Saturday Night Live"" were  starting to branch off into film projects. Dan Aykroyd in his the best role  of his life plays Cliff Skridlow, a nerdy college professor who has a  chance encounter with a group of 'professional' ladies.
When Cliff meets  a pimp (Howard Hessman) on the run from Chicago's most ruthless crime boss,  Mom, he must find a way to fend for the ladies who fear for their lives.  Their pimp has fled to Tahiti, and therefore Cliff the college professor  becomes Dr. Detroit, pimp extradonaire.
In a series of meetings with  Mom, Dr. Detroit becomes the most feared and legendary pimp throughout  Chicago. However his professional life is falling apart as the college is  in need of dire funds to continue operating. With the help of the girls and  their assistant Diablo (T.K. Carter) Cliff balances his professional and  social lives. But after being named ""Player of the Year,"" Cliff  must make an appearance at the annual ""Players Ball"" in order to  receive this honor. The problem is that he has another engagement for the  college on the same night and at the same hotel the ball is being held.  With Mom and her goons lurking nearby, the Doctor/Cliff will make this a  night you'll never forget.
Featuring a cast full of past and future  stars, and a soul-filled soundtrack, 'Doctor Detroit' was a showcase for  many talents. Three of the four women playing the 'girls' include a  pre-""Nanny"" Fran Drescher, Donna Dixon (she later married Dan  Aykroyd), and Lynn Whitfield (""Eve's Bayou""). The film also  includes a special appearance by soul legend James Brown as the main  attraction at the Players Ball.
Full of funny scenes including Aykroyd  impersonating a Southern lawyer and his battle with Mom at the junkyard,  Doctor Detroit gave Dan Aykroyd a vehicle to extend his comedic skills to  the fullest extent. The film's most classic scene is the excellently  choreographed opening at the Players Ball where everyone is grooving to the  rhythms of James Brown. Pimps, prostitutes, and crime lords all get  involved in what has to be an ode to the blaxploitation films of the past.
If you are looking for a clever, funny, and hip film, your search has  ended. ""Doctor Detroit"" still remains as one of the 1980's most  memorable comedies.",965779200,58,2442,4.823671497584541
