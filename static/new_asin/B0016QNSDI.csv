8264126,5,B0016QNSDI,"My 3 year old daughter is loving her new Thomas collection.  Vol #1,2 & 3 are watched frequently in our home.  Now if we can get the other volumes at a reasonable price we'll be all set!

Note... if you are trying to teach your children proper safety these videos may not help reinforce those lessons as there are a lot of crashes and accidents that take place on the railway.  My husband, 1 year old and I enjoy watching the videos with our 3 year old daughter... and we often joke about the lack of safety on the railway.  Very entertaining.",1219968000,,543,4.284313725490196
