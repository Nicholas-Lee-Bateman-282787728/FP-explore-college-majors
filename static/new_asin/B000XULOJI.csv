8229844,3,B000XULOJI,"This campy zombie musical is bound to steal your heart.  And your spleen.  Imagine being joyfully serenaded by a shambling dude with bloody decaying flesh right before he chomps on your face.  Song of the Dead is low budget, retarded fun.  With dead people singing...

{Flesh & blood, I want flesh & blood}

Yeah, it's lame.  Still it's hard not to laugh.  Zombies with operatic voices and well-choreographed dance moves.  It comes equipped with lots of blood spray and a bit of nudity to top off the silly songs.  It also has a bit of a political satire as the president warns the nation that terrorists have unleashed JRV (Jihad Resurrection Virus) on the nation.  He proudly sings his little emergency broadcast about the biological warfare causing the dead to rise from the grave.

While not as smart as it tries to be, Song of the Dead pays homage to Romero quite well.  It has good bloody effects with decent acting.  Nothing ground-breaking, but I recommend it to about any zombie comedy fan.",1281830400,,999,4.699421965317919
