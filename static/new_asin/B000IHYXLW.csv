The show is AMAZING the manga is AMAZING and the T. shirt is OK. Buy it before there out of stock.",1365292800,3,268,4.153846153846154
2656639,5,B000IHYXLW,"So far I have been able to find a most of the Eureka Seven Limited Edition Boxsets, for fairly cheap. I really enjoyed the anime, and it is one of my favorites, though I have many favorites, and being able to get the DVD's, a collectors box, a volume of the manga, and a awesome t-shirt, is truly amazing for me. I love the t-shirts, I feel like someone in the show would wear them, its really just kickass. I would recommend this series to anyone who like anime, or even people that aren't really in to it, but willing to try it out.",1344643200,,534,4.144230769230769
2656640,5,B000IHYXLW,I love this show and I will continue to buy this anime show! One of my favorite volumes.,1225238400,,88,3.9444444444444446
2656641,5,B000IHYXLW,"Things take a pretty dark turn in this volume, although it's accompanied by a lot more development of the story and the main characters. There's not much in the way of comedy in this volume, although they still manage to sneak it in where you least expect, but not in any way that feels completely out of place or strange. You really start to feel bad for Renton and what he's going through and how hard Holland is on him. Even when he does right he just can't win it seems.

It's definitely obvious that the next volume is going to see some important developments, which makes sense given that the next volume represents the halfway point and what would've represented the end of this season.

As expected, the show performs strongly on a technical level and retains its quality through this volume.

The extras included in this volume are pretty similar to the special editions released before it. The shirt is back to a size large and is dark gray with Nirvash's head as monochrome art in white on the front with the E7 logo on the back. The manga is decent, but still lacks the charm and style the series has.",1209254400,,1113,4.472906403940887
2656642,5,B000IHYXLW,"In Eureka Seven volume 5 you get four very good episodes of the show. Eureka has been feeling angry and sick for a while now. She takes the Nirvash into the depths of the mine alone. Meanwhile, the military attacks the Gekko again. Eureka is partially absorbed by a scub, a strange creature, before Renton gets to her, but the damage has been done.

Holland takes a mission to rescue a Vodarac priest much to Renton's dismay who believes they should help Eureka. Little does he know that only a Vodarac priest can help Eureka. Renton goes through extreme emotional distress feeling responsible for Eureka's illness and after he is yelled at by Talho, he goes to help Holland and under extreme pressure, cracks and goes on a disturbing rampage.

Eureka has been saved by the Vodarac priest, but no one dares to approach Renton after his ordeal. Unable to take the guilt anylonger, Renton leaves the Gekko. Feeling down, Renton meets two people named Charles and Ray who accept the boy. Elsewhere, the crew try and move on keeping Eureka ignorant to Renton's departure.

 Renton now lives with Charles and Ray and couldn't be much happier, and Eureka starts to cope with her feelings. However, both Renton and Eureka don't know something that will break their hearts...Overall, these four episode are very good and disturbing, as well as heartbreaching at times. The episodes are of a depressing nature as simple misunderstandings cause major problems. Still, these are some of the best episodes of the show. I recommend this disc to any fan of anime, but recommend the first DVD before this one or you will find yourself lost.",1176854400,,1625,4.813620071684587
2656643,5,B000IHYXLW,"The fifth volume of Eureka Seven is all about alienation. Namely, that of Renton and Eureka, who ironically enough, love each other. But through misunderstanding and selfishness, they succeed only in making each others lives miserable. As the crew of Gekkostate desperately try to finish the repairs to their ship, hundreds of government forces surround them. Even as all of this is going on, Eureka takes off in the Nirvash. Renton sets off in high speed pursuit. When he finds her she seems to be on the verge of being absorbed by the cave walls. When he pulls her out she is losing consciouness and her body is coated in some sort of viscous liquid. Will Eureka be able to survive, and will they get back to the ship in time?

The thing that is becoming a bit annoying in this show is that we're almost halfway through the run, and we haven't got the answers to even 1/4 of the questions that are on my mind. What are Eureka and Anemone? Normal girls, androids, clones, aliens? What is the origin of the LFOs? What really happened to Renton's dad? What is the Amita drive? These are some pretty hefty questions and it's not really right to hold off on even the most basic details in such a long show. I don't know if my interest can be held that long. But for all that, Eureka Seven is one of the best anime I've seen. The animation is second to none and the characterization is really honest. It still bugs me that someone as young as Renton is having to experience all these horrible things. Renton should have made just a tad older, maybe 17 or 18, because the story being told her is definitely not for kids. Awesome show.

For more fleshing out of the situations and characters, I would highly recommend picking up the first three volumes of the manga, also published by Bandai. Other anime I would recommend would be Fullmetal Alchemist and Full Metal Panic.",1166832000,,1867,4.504424778761062

It was a bargain at the time with a free T-shirt,a comic book and addictive storyline to follow!
WOW!",1388448000,2,121,4.304347826086956
8145497,4,B000IHYXLW,I got this for my son because he loves the show. I have watched it with him and seen the whole of the series I believe. It was pretty good and I enjoyed the story. It is engrossing and you can get invested in the characters without fear of them going poof by the end. I think the ending was pretty good to and like how they left it so that it could continue. I like a story that has a happy ending. I would though recommend seeing it from the start to finish and not trying to watch out of order.,1376870400,2,496,3.872549019607843
