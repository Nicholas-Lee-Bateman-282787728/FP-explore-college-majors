8189926,5,B000P93BM0,"Not the worst and not the best shot-on-video film, but Mutilations puts the ambition and humor on it's sleeve for all to see making this a fun watch unless you're a stodgy ""oh this could have been that way"" critic (like my sister is, and the less said about that, the better).

So, set your expectations low (and that implies not waiting with a burning anticipation to see special effects that cannot realistically be expected), and you won't even need popcorn OR pills popped (but a PIZZA, for heaven's sake, might come under consideration; not a substitute for a significant other, but in a pinch, a pizza has been known to add a certain elegance to an evening, and I am of course speaking of a frozen pizza POPPED in an oven and properly cooked for maximum low-budget impact).

You might also add some soda pop, but wait for the Iggy Pop or you won't be able to hear the dialogue of the movie, and as much as I like Iggy Pop, he can wait because you'll want to absorb the goings-ons in this one.

Come to think of it, I've never heard of (nor have I heard of anybody whispering a confession of) anyone ever eating a can of corn while watching a DVD. I'm not saying that it hasn't been done or that it could not ever be did (and let's face it, a lot can go on while sitting in one's living room watching a B, D, F, or especially a Z-Movie, but I didn't mean to put any unpleasant images in your mind while trying hard to decide if you want to buy a shot-on-video epic or not), just that one could really change the course of cinematic movie-goer history by eating canned corn instead of popcorn.

It's nonconformist now, but in the near-future, who knows? Trends have been known to be set in quiet waves of near-cosmic change, so don't be surprised if a can-opener and a bib (optional) becomes a required tool for silver screen enjoyment someday.",1516320000,,1848,4.3790087463556855

8189929,3,B000P93BM0,"I am giving this one 3 stars for the laughs. The main character's line fumbling, and his rage-belying gaze while delivering the goofed lines, was enough to make me laugh out loud a couple of times. There is no way on Earth that this is a 3 star movie. You have to like bad cinema in order to really appreciate this one, it's total Cheese. Yes, you probably know what you are getting yourself into if you're picking up this little indy ""gem"". I just don't want you to think you're getting a competitor to Alien or something akin to it. You most certainly are not. This is rubber-suit monster, low-budget schlock from a decade known for it, the 80's. If you are into that, grab this up and kick back. If you are looking for a serious movie to watch, I would pass on this one. You'd likely rather listen to somebody yell at you in a language you doh't understand than have to sit through this, looking for redeeming value of any kind.",1477958400,,931,4.325714285714286
8189930,2,B000P93BM0,"Johns Horror Corner: Mutilations (1986), a 70-minute B-movie with a Claymation Gorn alien monster.
Boring, boring, and more boring.  The best part of this movie was its silly Claymation, and they overplayed it so much that it became more annoying than entertaining.  Hard fail, and not even ""so bad it's good.""

So why am I watching this?  I had never heard of it.  No one had recommended it.  And that is the reason.  I could say the same for the quite obscure Nightwish (1990) or The Night Feeder (1988) which, however poor and boring, did have a most bizarrely interesting payoff in the end with a tentacle-tongued brain-sucking mutant babynot that Id recommend it.  These are the often somewhat regrettable films that I just cant help myself but to need to see from time to time.  And this is another one

We open with an astronomy professor explaining the basics of the thousands of stars visible during an evening class trip with his students, of one which asks if any of those distant specs (i.e., the stars) could have life on them.  The answer is NO.  A burning star (i.e., a SUN) would fry any lifeform!  The planets that we cannot see, however, do have a shot at housing life.  Next question. LOL.

The same night, using the light from his hobo garbage fire, a vagrant reads in the newspaper about recent cattle mutilations as a meteor is revealed to actually be a UFO.  About as casually as approaching the new neighbors across the street, he casually approach the spaceship to meet a slimy-clawed reptilian aliena more menacing Gorn (Star Trek) monster really.

Our astronomy class takes a trip out to the remote area where some lights in the sky sightings have been made and cattle have been mutilated.  They find the most terribly (yet hilariously) mutilated Claymation steer.  Its pretty poor, and you can actually see the green screen separating the actors from the flayed-inside-out steer as it thrashes.  Its pretty goofy.

Speaking of not taking this at all seriously, our professor uses phrases like conduct legitimate scientific research when he really means gaze at the sky with his students, and he identifies his job title, specialty and institution to basically everyone he meets. In fact, almost all dialogue in this movie is exposition, and often needless.

The effects are pretty entertaining (even if dumb). A victim is strangled and his head shrivels and transforms into a sloppy gory mess.  The finale includes some tentacle-armed Claymation aliens (looking like the Gorn and Brundlefly had a baby) against green-screened students armed with harpoons and flashlights.  And, of course, there was that Claymation steer.

Officially listed at 1:07:30 (67.5 minutes), there were 2.5 minutes of opening credits with no scenes taking place in the backgroundjust empty space and theme musicand the closing credits begin at 1:05:00, leaving this haphazard film barely over 60 minutes.  Although that might be something of a blessing considering how boring it is.

This 60-minute B-movie was written, directed and produced by one-and-done filmmaker Larry Thomas (no other credits) and stars almost entirely actors who had never been in anything else, nor would they ever.  The acting is on the verge of robotic, like they were reading cue cards completely unrehearsed and limiting the filming to single takes.

As much as the Claymation scenes made me smile, they were overused and often repeated the same footage several times.  And as silly as the premise was, the movie was too boring to really embrace its badness.  It was almost as if they were trying to make a real movie on a shoestring budget and an inexperienced cast, rather than realizing what this truly was and running with it.

Just terrible.  I recommend this to no one.",1477094400,3,3758,4.93312101910828

8189933,5,B000P93BM0,"This is one of those B films that is, ""SO BAD, it's GOOD"". Horrible acting, cheesy non stop motion monsters, bad script, delayed actor response & so much more. Summing up with the gore FX, they are pretty good, making this flick, ""A MUST HAVE""  to own in your B-MOVIE library. 2 BLOODY THUMBS UP, WAY UP !!",1469836800,2,306,4.275862068965517
8189934,5,B000P93BM0,"It was a hoot to work on. And now, low these many years later, it is a hoot to watch. I remember I had the miniatures camera ready long before principle photography began. So there was no delay from the wrap on live action and the start on the SPFX .Our producer, director was wise enough to shoot on a high grade 16 mm stock to accommodate the rear projection and other effects we would be doing. The star, ""spaced out"" Al Baker was one of the main assistants on the miniature effects work and proved invaluable. We shot all the animation and other miniature set ups in about two weeks or so but ended up only doing about 50% of what was originally story boarded. Somehow, it looks reasonably complete now.",1468022400,,707,4.363636363636363
8189935,4,B000P93BM0,"I can think of only a handful of movies that accomplished their goal of ""intentionally"" making an otherwise seriously intended film very funny, without the comedy approach.  STRAIGHT JACKET aka DARK SANITY, with Aldo Ray (not the Joan Crawford one!), and WINTER BEAST are a couple of others that come to mind.  How did they do that?  In my opinion, they did it by the use of crafty acting and writing, editing, and some obviously goofy special effects.  MUTILATIONS follows a group of students out on a ""field trip"", who encounter alien beings.  That may sound like a typical film of the day, but the interaction between the ""teacher"" and his students is what initially got me into the movie.  The guy who plays the teacher is flat out spaced out.  You won't believe how he conducts himself in some of the most bizarre of ways.  But the big payoff is the stop-motion and other effects of the alien being. Like all of these movies, anyone who calls them ""cheesy"" probably wasn't even born when these were made.  These movies are an art form that transcends any cheap shot that the uninformed may take a swipe at critically, because they just don't get it.  If you are of my ilk, you will love this movie, and cherish it as one that will never get to DVD, making it's rarity a one of a kind viewing event.",1353283200,10,1303,4.483050847457627
