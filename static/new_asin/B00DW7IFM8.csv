8598644,1,B00DW7IFM8,"If you've been collecting the smurfs as they come out on dvd, then you won't have to buy this dvd.  All episodes on this dvd (and I mean ALL episodes) have already been release over the past few years on prior dvd releases.  That is good news, because this is one less dvd on your list of dvds to buy!  Again, this dvd, just released, is a repeat.  do not buy it if you've been collecting the smurfs on prior dvds.  this dvd has:  Fake Smurf,  Baby Smurf, The Smurfette, Fuzzle Trouble, Bewitched Bothered and Besmurfed.  Again, these are all repeats!",1384819200,8,551,4.3861386138613865
