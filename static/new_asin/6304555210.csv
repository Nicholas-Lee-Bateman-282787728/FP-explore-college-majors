899942,5,6304555210,"This was not a championship fight, this was a WAR.  It's was obvious, then and now, that Frazier detested ALI.  ALI always publicly humiliated Frazier, either by calling him a gorilla, chump, uncle tom, etc...  By this time, their third and final battle, this was simply a war of attrition.  Their wasn't much dancing by ALI, and Frazier constantly stalked his prey as ususal.  Simply back and forth action for 14 rounds.  Can't get any better than this!! Other than probably their first battle ""The Fight of the Century"".",970012800,5,522,4.808988764044944
899943,4,6304555210,"Great action packed fight from rounds 1 to 14. All Ali fans (like myself) should posses this video. Both Ali and Frazier went to their physical limits in trying to obtain the victory. As a person who has seen other Frazier  fights I can tell you that Frazier put more effort into this fight than he  did in his whole proffessional career. That includes the ""Fight of the  Century"" (Ali-Frazier I). Ali seemed to bring out the fire in him.
  Also great officiating by referee Padilla. He does a great job of  handleing both fighters (especially Ali who had a habit of holding) thus  allowing for continuous action.
I personally disagree with the other  reviewers who claim that the commentary was weak. Perhaps Flip Wilson and  Hugh O'Brien were not that great but Dumphry and Norton do a fine job.  Especially Ken Norton. I feel Norton offers a rich contribution to this  video. Norton does an excellent job of anylising the strengths and  weaknesses of both fighters. And believe me he's on point. As a boxer  himself who had faught Ali (twice at this point in time) and was a sparring  partner for Frazier it's easy to understand why Norton has such great  knowledge. It's also interesting to note that Fraziers cornerman Edie Futch  was Norton's former handler.
I urge all of you viewers (and future  purchasers) to listen to Norton's comments at the same time you watch the  fight and you'll agree with me that Norton's on point with his anlysis. He  should give Foreman and Vinny Panzianze some pointers on how to to better  commentary of boxing matches. I feel that Norton should seriously consider  becoming a regualar commentator of todays fights. NORTON'S BETTER THAN  GEORGE FOREMAN WILL EVER BE AT BOXING COMMENTARY.
My only dissapointment  was that unlike the ""Rumble in The Jungle"" this video doesn't  have a post fight interview. I felt that the ""Rumble's"" post  fight interview was very interesting (not to mention exciting). I would  liked to have heard what the boxers and trainers had to say. A little bit  of the post fight interview is on the ""Ali:The Whole Story""  series. I had assumed that much more of this would have been on this video.  I was thus surprised when none of it was shown. That's why I gave this video  4 instead of 5 stars while I rated the ""Rumble"" a perfect  5.
One thing is for sure:ALI IS THE GREATEST!",956620800,5,2345,4.6601466992665035
899944,5,6304555210,"muhammad swings with a left,ali swings with a right.and so he did throwing blow after blow,each men putting everything what they've got.it's a heroic classic battle of two men with legitimate claim of the crown. Ali summoning  all his energy,with adevastating lightning combination one rarely sees.at  the end of the epic battle,as Ali said before the fight""it's gonna be  a chilla and a thrilla when i get that gorilla in manila."" prophecy  was fulfilled.at the start of round fifteen Frazier wasn't allowed .as his  manager eddie futch said.""you don't send a blind fighter into a  slaughter house.""very inspiring.you'll see the way  muhammad ali  fought as in old days.",956534400,2,671,5.148148148148148
899945,5,6304555210,"This was simply one of the most brutal boxing matches of all time.  Non-stop action for 14 rounds.  Plus this video has the entire fight and even the pre-fight introductions.  The only drawback are the lousy TV  commentators: Don Dunphy, Ken Norton, Flip Wilson, and Hugh O'Brien. I'd  rather hear Howard Cosell; at least he knew how to properly describe the  action.",948067200,2,367,4.838709677419355
899946,5,6304555210,"The ""Thrilla in Manilla"" is without a doubt the best heavyweight fight I have seen. One of the best feuds in sports. This fight showed the skill, the passion, and above all else, the courage of both men. Neither  man was willing to go down to the other. This fight went back and forth,  each man giving and receiving a tremendous amount of punishment. Yet each  man kept moving foward, neither man ever backed down. This was one of the  hardest hitting, action packed fights of all-time, but because it was for  the world title, and because the two fighters were Ali and Frazier and with  everything between them, that it why it is the best heavyweight fight of  all-time.",944956800,3,672,4.55

7874362,5,6304555210,"This is the best boxing match in history.  No one is clear precisely what drove Ali and Frazier to take each other to hell again and again, but watching this reminds you that Frazier had the worst attitude an opponent can have:  ""I refuse to lose"".  It doesn't matter how many times Frazier gets his mouthpiece knocked out, nor does it matter to him when Ali starts opening up his face like a can of tomatoes.  He absolutely refuses to give up.

Ali employs the rope-a-dope not like he usually did (with absolute ease), but with a kind of quiet desperation.  Frazier keeps bombarding him with shots that sound like huge hands striking bongos.  At times this gets so intense that you expect them to jump out of the ring and start beating each other up.

You can feel how important this is when you watch it.  Ali ultimately triumphs, of course, but what Eddie Futch told Frazier is undeniably true: ""No one will ever forget what you did here tonight"".  Their first fight is great, true, and it isn't a rubber match; but it cannot live up to this final consummation of personal hatred between Ali and Frazier.

This is required material for anyone who loves boxing, also giving us a sense of how underappreciated Joe Frazier was until just recently.",1148256000,,1247,4.572072072072072
7874363,5,6304555210,"October 1st, 1975, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier meet in Manilla for their third epic battle.  NBC Sports put together this special program for its ""Greatest Bouts of All-Time"" Series, which originally aired in the early 1990's.  Hosted by Marv Alpert and the ""Fight Doctor"" Ferdie Pachecho, the two review the bout round by round with commentary from Frazier, Angelo Dundee, Eddie Futch, and the referee Carlos Padilla.  It is very well done, with a good introduction to the fight, the controversy that surrounded it, Frazier's personal hatred of Ali, and of course the exciting bout itself.

The fight is spectacular, Ali taking the early rounds, Frazier taking over the middle rounds, and then the slugfest finish!  Both fighters gave everything of themselves in this their last fight.  Although I personally believe their first fight in 1971 was better, this is certainly a fight worth every frame of film.  It is certainly one of Ali's greatest fights.

Highly recommended for all fight fans.
