As for the film itself: It's a powerful, tense, beautifully made war film, set in Iraq.  Not a political film, it examines the psychology of men in  danger, and how some men become addicted to it.  Mostly critically lionized, but attacked by many, especially soldiers for being inaccurate, I didn't take the film that literally, or think of it as documentary realism, but more a stylized almost poetic look at the insanity of wars and those caught up in them, much like Full Metal Jacket.  This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one.  There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is muted.  Its more a disturbing picture than a moving one.  But it made me think and made my heart race, and images and moments stayed with me for days.",1456790400,,1043,4.4188481675392675
