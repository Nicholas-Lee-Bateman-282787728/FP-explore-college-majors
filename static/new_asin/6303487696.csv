683438,1,6303487696,"Any time you connect the words ""The Walking Dead"" with the Marine Corps, it should only be in reference to 1st Battalion 9th Marine Regiment.  Like the phrase ""Devil Dogs"" it was a title bestowed upon them out of fear and respect by an ENEMY commander.  There is no battalion in the Marine Corps and I'm sure the Army who paid a higher price or served a longer period in combat than 1/9.

While this movie's is a fine walk in the woods, it's title is tremendously misleading, especially since the movie references Vietnam and the Marine Corps.  It's not just being offended that the Marine Corps is portrayed in some weird light and we Marines or veterans can't bear to see that.  On the contrary no one knows more about how whacked the corps or even the military can be than Marines.  The problem is, that this connects the very real Marines, living, wounded and dead, that served in 1/9, with nonsense and, I think, tarnishes the image especially for people who don't know the real story.

All of America should know the story of 1/9 in Vietnam to fully understand the sacrifice that our young people of all services made in that place without asking for justification.  We should be honoring these men instead of associating their sacrifice and glory with nonsense.

All that is just an attempt at an explanation as to why some reviewers are ""over the top"" with their harshness at this movie and the connection.",1316563200,3,1414,4.601593625498008
683439,5,6303487696,"Folks, lets calm down a bit and remember that this is a movie and not a documentary. I enjoyed this film for the entertainment value rather than insight on history. Any movie with Eddie Griffin and Bernie Mac in it will demand a chuckle. I'm a military vet and have much respect for all who served in the vietnam war, but lets not trash the film over inaccuracies... instead enjoy this fictional account of good men in a bad situation having to rely on one another to survive.",1313280000,22,476,4.420454545454546

683473,1,6303487696,"The Walking Dead (Preston A. Whitmore, 1995)

On its face, The Walking Dead wants to tell us the story of a platoon in Vietnam who are sent off to rescue some POWs. And that would probably have been a pretty cool movie. What we get, however, is anything but. Instead, Whitmore (best-known for his next project, the Laurence Fishburne vehicle Fled) uses the flimsy framework of his story to explore any number of stereotypes, conspiracy theories, and flights of fantasy. It's interesting to compare the movie to Dead Presidents, the Albert and Allen Highes film released later that year, which turns this on its head (the Vietnam footage, instead of frame, is flashback); the Hughes Brothers cover much the same ground, but do it far better.

Here we have five soldiers. At the top of the food chain is Barkley (The Inkwell's Joe Morton), current sergeant and former priest, and arrayed under him are wise-cracking Brache (Malcolm and Eddie's Eddie Griffin), studious Cole (House of Payne's Allen Payne), earnest Brooks (Menace II Society's Vonte Sweet), and dangerously unstable Corporal Pippin (Instinct's Roger Floyd). The five of them realize something about the mission stinks from the get-go, but we spend far less time thinking about the mission than we do about how all these characters got to Vietnam in the first place.

I've described a number of characters as two-dimensional over the years, but I'm not sure I've ever seen characters define the trait as well as these do. Everything that happens in Vietnam is right out of a bad superhero comic, while everything that happens homeside is a tale of injustice and woe (except Pippin's tale, which is obviously meant to convey his dangerousness and instability).Even if you did manage to bring yourself to care about what goes on in this movie enough to try and predict what was going to happen, after the first tale of life before Vietnam and the first couple of Vietnam scenes, you'd be more than able to figure out the progression the movie would take; the only suspense becomes what order the tales get told in as they escalate in their woe-is-me status, and how silly the situation will get in Vietnam.

As I said, Dead Presidents covers much of the same ground, in that odd lattice of coincidence that seems to hang over Hollywood (think about The Lost Boys and Near Dark being released in the same year independent of one another, or Mission to Mars and Red Planet). The difference is that the Hughes Brothers understand how to write realistic characters and realistic scenes in a way that seems entirely lost on Whitmore (who also wrote the script). As a result, the Hughes Brothers put out a movie that is one of Hollywood's neglected treasures of the nineties. The Walking Dead, on the other hand, firmly deserves the oblivion to which it has been consigned. You'd do better leaving these bones moldering in the grave. *",1263600000,4,2889,4.842105263157895
683474,4,6303487696,"Did John Wayne show the Green Berets the way they truly were? Of course not. Did John Wayne fight Guadalcanal the way it was really fought? Of course not. In The Red Ball Express, how many of the drivers were black. Do, don't tell me there can't be a movie called The Walking Dead and it has to be about some real soldiers. This was a good movie with good actors. Eddie Griffin gives a good showing in this movie, as does Allen Payne and Courtney Vance.
My only fault with the story was to have them smoking marijuana in the field. That's something that would not have happened in Vietnam. 'Charlie' would have smelled them way way back. Otherwise, I enjoyed this. It is one of my favorites along with Siege At Firebase Gloria.",1255564800,,727,4.392592592592592
683475,5,6303487696,"I always have to debunk those negative remarks when it comes to military movies.  First of all, the U.S. government is not going to allow a true movie to come about any mission.  Secondly, the director got the idea from someone who was obviously involved in this situation so don't blame them, blame the person who told it.  Black Hawk Down contained fallacies itself.  Don't believe me?  The next time you watch a ""military"" movie, watch it with a servicemember:  They will find something wrong.  ACTUAL REPRESENTATION IS NOT ALLOWED.

I enjoyed this movie immensely:  The actors work well together and it imparts the idea that everyone has a reason for joining the military.  It is interesting and I am happy to have it as part of my movie collection.",1184025600,,753,4.723076923076923

This crew unites in The Marine Corps on a rescue mission that turns out to be a decoy mission.  Hoover (Eddie Griffin) makes the movie enjoyable while Sgt. Barkley (joe Morton) keeps it military. Cole ( Allen Payne) keeps it real with the tiki and his insistence on  not calling Muhammad Ali Cassius Clay.

It also showed that even the best of people have a dark past stashed away that most would be shocked by like the squad leader in this movie. It shows why service men may become withdrawn by fear of losing friends like Eddie lost JR Flip after he let down his gaurd and invited him in and showed him the rope.

7850474,4,6303487696,"Review of the movie, not tape or disc quality.

Don't confuse this movie with the TV series of the same name.  This is older by nearly two decades.  The Walkin Dead refer to this small group of Marines unknowingly sent out as a decoy force in Vietnam to retrieve POWs.  As a retired military person I have a special affinity to movies made during my era.  Overall I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  One actor was too over the top for my liking but the rest were quite good.  Each of the characters had their own reason(s) for being in the Corps.

I will point out the audio effects such as guns shooting sounded more like an older Western rather than a war movie.
