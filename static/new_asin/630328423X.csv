628592,5,630328423X,"Susan Powter makes exercise possible for anyone, regardless of age, weight, or physical considerations. This video simply proves it.  If you are used to videos that have loud music, and dance styled choreography, then this one isn't for you.  If you are fat, fit or some where in between this can be modified to help you get the body you always wanted. Susan doesn't intimidate you, or lose you with high-speed moves.  She teaches you, while keeping your attention, and helping you ultimately change your life.  BUY IT!  You won't regret it.  END",902620800,,546,4.817204301075269
628674,5,630328423X,"Great workout, fun and I always have to smile at how crazy Susan is! She gets me motivated, and I always feel like I'm okay doing what my fitness level allows. This is a really important part of Susan's teaching: modify! She's very encouraging.",1336608000,2,244,4.568181818181818

that's the only video that's helped me to lose the  baby wait after 1 year of struggling.

628676,1,630328423X,"I Ordered the tape Burn Fat get fit and also ordered building strength and Lean Strong and healthy...Was excited to get started working out, since I had done these tapes years ago and saw great results.  I am very disappointed that the one tape is not in english and non of them will work in my dved player or x box sytem...it comes up error can not read out of region. SO $19.99 down the drain.

Now I have three great workout tapes that I can not use! BEWARE",1294531200,,460,4.157303370786517
628677,5,630328423X,"Over 55, totally out of shape, hadn't exercised for YEARS. Susan got me going because she adjusts for all fitness levels and is very motivating. Pace is easy to follow. I have bought her other videos for variety and her books too. I am hooked. Been exercising with this tape and her other tapes for 10 months now, eating low fat as per her books, and I have already lost 40 lbs. It was easy! I am well on my way to losing my goal of 68 lbs. Have shared info I learned with friends and they were amazed to learn how much fat they were actually eating even though they thought they were eating healthy. Have not found any other fitness guru's tape that was this easy to follow.",1265500800,,675,4.2
628678,5,630328423X,"I have three Susan Powter work out tapes that I really enjoy. I love her enthusiasum and high energy. She encourages everyone to modify and build thier own strength at their own pace. She reminds me to breath, suck my stomach in whether I feel it or not! I have fit back into my summer close by just firming up through her work outs. Two of my sisters also report they have lost inches by doing the Susan Powter workouts. Thank you Susan!!! Glad to see you have made a come back, and are looking GREAT as ever.",1179532800,,510,4.214285714285714
628679,5,630328423X,"I love Susan Powter.  She has great energy, she really knows what it's like to be uncomfortable and unhappy.  She is passionate about what she does, I haven't seen any new material in the past few years.  I have one video that shows her with a bunch of people of all shapes and sizes exercizing.  She is inspiring to me.  She also makes me laugh with her analogies on the fitness world.  She is truly geniune.  I highly recommend her material.  I'm glad the rest of the fitness world finally caught on to what she's been talking about.  Thank goodness.",1086048000,10,552,4.44
628680,5,630328423X,"I just wanted to add my positive comments on this video.  I am pretty out of shape, and I find it doable.  I know I can grow with this video, because even after the few times I have used it, I have modified the moves to make them more challenging, or less challenging, if I am tired or sore.  I NEVER get sore after doing this video.  Susan points out proper form throughout.  I have definitely felt the different in my muscles while walking up the stairs.  I am more agile now than I was before I bought this video.  I have about 10 videos, and this is my favourite.  Do yourself a favour and get yourself a step.  It just wasn't worth my time to do it without the step.",1079222400,8,671,4.061068702290076
628681,5,630328423X,"I just want to tell everyone out there and Thank Susan Powter for making this video.  My Dad is completely addicted to this video.  Every morning from 8 - 9 he has been doing this exercise program for years.  My Dad was diagnosed with prostrate cancer and then esophacus cancer.  He had a radiation bead for his prostrate to keep that under control as it was caught early.  Then they were checking him at his regular check up and had found a small growth of cancer on his esophagus. He exercised to this video until the date of his surgery.  They told him normally they would not be able to do this operation on a 70 year old man... However because of his great strength from his exercising they felt his heart could handle this surgery.  If he did not have this surgery the cancer would have spread, as this is a very delicate area to have a growth.  We told the doctors we owed it to Susan Powter for his strength.  His surgery was done he ran into complications as he was leaking protein as the tissues were like sewing wet kleenex together... so they opened him up yet 3 more times.  Again they would not have been able to do this if he had not exercised his heart... with this video daily.  He is now free and cancer free!!  I drop in sometimes to see him in the mornings and we all know from 8 - 9 am he is working his Susan Powter Video. We know he will not answer the phone or anything else during this time. This morning he called me very sad as his machine ate the tape...  We now need to get him a new one and mabe even a DVD copy if possible so this does not happen again...  So that is why I am on the WEB site right now to find out how to get him a copy and a back up copy.  He is lost this morning with out it.
Anyway that is my story... His name is Lawrence.. Dad I am so proud of you and your dedication to doing this video daily...  Thanks Susan for my Dad...",1077062400,32,1877,4.032432432432432
628682,5,630328423X,"This is an intelligent workout - one of the best ever, for ALL levels - if you are usually tempted to abandon workout sessions and exhausting exercise videos, this one's for you. Susan is genuinely encouraging/supportive and, as always, full of energy. Everything is basic - you workout at your rythm.  You feel great and oxygenated. What is super with this tape, is that it goes like this: 3 minutes cardio, followed by 1 min. muscular exercices, followed by stretching. Everything is brilliantly combined, so that, at the end of the 45-minute session, you really feel you've covered quite a lot. I am just a beginner, and I feel I can do anything while I train with this - I truly feel ""supported""! Plus, Susan and her 2 teammates really do seem to enjoy themselves. If you want to get back to moving and losing weight, at your rythm, go ahead and buy this!",1069459200,10,859,4.577922077922078
628683,5,630328423X,"I started with Susan after being away from exercising for a while, and now I don't even bother with the other tapes I was using.  The great thing about this tape is that it combines aerobics with strength training in a compact, sensible workout (who has time to do them on separate days? I don't). I add some other moves, like push-ups, while Susan is doing the ""reconnect with your body"" thing at the end. I love Susan's zany, down-to-earth style, and the routine is easy enough to learn quickly, despite a few problems with editing.  Susan's ""Stop the Insanity!"" is what got me serious about exercising in the first place, so I'll stick with her.  It's so nice and refreshing to hear someone talk about strength and wellness, instead of ""thin"" and ""sexy.""  Give this video a try---you won't regret it!",1042502400,7,803,4.633802816901408
628705,2,630328423X,"I'm an intermediate to advanced excersiser and I borrowed this video from the library for variety. I was disappointed. Susan says that the video is for all fitness levels, but I barely broke a sweat. I was so bored because the moves rarely changed. There was only one ab exercise which didn't target the obliques or lower abdomen and if she said ""Oxygen"" one more time, I planned on screaming. She didn't even do most of the workout. She spent most of the time talking to her flunkies. I don't recommend this video. If beginners are looking for a step and toning video, try some of Kathy Smith's workouts.",1036713600,,605,4.559633027522936
628706,5,630328423X,"Hi!  I just did this video for the 5th time and love it because I know I can modify my moves based on where I am fitness wise.  I had gained 70 lbs after a lower back operation a few yrs ago and of course now want to get my body back. I certainly do not like all of the complex choreography type dance steps that a lot of the other fitness gurus use because I just cannot do them.  Powter's moves are definately challenging and it makes me feel good that I know I can modify the moves in several different ways that she carefully explains, so that I can continue working out without having to stop just because it is too difficult.  I think this is a very good video for beginners, intermediate, or even advanced.  Susan, please keep making the videos!! Sincerely, April",1030924800,4,770,4.2465753424657535
628707,5,630328423X,"Some people are put off by Susan Powter, and I can understand why, but when it comes to leading a workout, her technique is tops.  The workout itself is well-designed -- the choreography is easy but varied enough to hold your interest.  It's a complete workout, getting to all the major muscles, and the fact that it uses intervals is especially useful for all fitness types.  While the ""toning"" intervals cannot substitute for true strength training, it's a good sub-maximal workout for those non-strength training days, and it's a good introduction to using weights for those who have never done it.
Powter's mantra is ""modification"" and that's another thing that makes this video useful for all fitness levels.  She is constantly reminding you (and showing you!) that if a move is too difficult, or you are getting tired, you can modify the move but keep moving to keep the heart rate up.  As you become more fit, you can go longer, do the more intense moves, etc., and constantly progress.  This is a tape that will have a long useful life because you can keep challenging yourself and keep progressing.  Unlike so many other ""aerobic instructors"" she also emphasises using proper form and resistance to get the most out of your time in the workout.
It's so refreshing to have a workout by an encouraging, understanding, knowledgeable instructor, not to mention a varied workout that doesn't require an M.F.A. in dance to be able to do it.  Whether you have never done a formal workout in your life, or if you are an experienced aerobicizer, this video will give you a hard but DOABLE workout that will really make a difference in your health and body.",1024790400,10,1656,4.765734265734266
628708,5,630328423X,"Yes, the production value is iffy.  OK, the music leaves a little to be desired.  Please, stop sticking the camera down her throat.  But dang...this is great stuff and it really does work.  Fast paced, challenging without being lethal, enough changes to make the time fly by...it's one of the best of it's kind and it's become the only thing I consistently do.  It's been incredibly beneficial to me - not only with fitness issues but with chronic sciatic-joint inflamation that has virtually gone away since I started this.  I recommend it to anybody that says, ""Oh, I need to start working out...(heavy sigh)"" because I don't feel like that about it anymore - this tape makes it do-able.",1023753600,6,689,4.7478991596638656
628709,5,630328423X,"This is the best tape I have. It's really easy to follow and didn't frustrate me when I first started using it because the moves are pretty simple and I'm usually a klutz when I do aerobics at the gym!
I like the interval training part of it because it gives you small ""breaks"" in between cardio sessions.
I did this tape 5x a week and lost 2lbs a week with no real dieting, just watching what I eat using common sense and drinking lots of water. I lost about 30lbs total in the end. If you are a beginner like I was, I highly recommend this tape. When you get more confident you can add a step to your routine, more (hand)weight etc, so it will still be challenging. I wish Susan would make another video too!",1019520000,11,710,4.1521739130434785
628710,5,630328423X,"I bought this tape just recently and have used it about 3 times now. This is a great tape!! I am a beginner in doing cardio workouts and I am not that coordinated especially with a step (which is recommended but not required for this video). Susan's moves are simple and to the point. She is so motivating and I also loved the fact that she keeps reminding you of how to do the exercises correctly and she shows you how to modify every step. I can see down the road this tape might get boring because of the basic moves, but it is effective and you really burn up a sweat!! I also like how the tape alternates from cardio to toning with the weights. I would recommend this tape to anyone who wants to get a great non-complicated all-around good workout. 2 thumbs up!!",1018569600,,767,4.260273972602739
628711,4,630328423X,Excellent exercise tape. Keeps you motivated. Susan explains what is going on and keeps reminding you to go at your own pace. I use this tape often.,1010707200,2,148,4.518518518518518
628712,5,630328423X,"I owned this video in Australia and when I came to the US I just had to have it.  I bought at least 1/2 dozen others - what a waste of money, this one is the best. As someone previously said the editing is not the best. You overlook that because of the varied interval training that works all your body and is not too hard or too easy. Whatever fitness level you can do it via 'modification'. I am tempted to buy another of her videos but find it hard to imagine another video could be better.",1002672000,,493,4.030612244897959
628713,5,630328423X,"I felt terrible and was in an horrible marriage when I started working out with ""Burn Fat & Get Fit"" with Susan Powter. Following, I had proceeded to joining a gym for a couple of years, not forgetting about my workout tape. I lost 40lbs and went from 165lbs to 125lbs. I have now been single for over two years and still feel great thanks to Susan. However, I have since quit the gym after 2 years.  Furthermore, with Susan Powter I can continue to keep my appearance the way it is. She has helped me raise my self esteem by feeling better about myself while remaining thin still at 125lbs. I would like to personally thank her, also I would like to see her come back to publics eye.  For Susan was helpful more than one way, not only the weight, I have never felt better.
Sincerely,
Lisa Barber",999302400,3,796,4.3
628714,5,630328423X,"I got this video from the library one night, took it home and started watching.  Next thing I knew I was up off the couch and joining in.  It is honestly the best video I have ever purchased, and believe me I have a lot of exercise videos.",980208000,10,239,3.9583333333333335
628793,4,630328423X,"I found this video a lot better than Lean Strong and Healthy. It was quick, easy and not boring. I would find it easy to stick with the step aerobics just knowing I was going to switch again in just three minutes. It  has also provided some early morning amusement too! I have noticed whoever  put the end result of this video together didn't do a good job. Be on the  lookout for moving steps and Eric's disapearing then reapearing sweat on  his shirt. Also Sally NEVER breaks a sweat and her hair is ALWAYS perfect.",960681600,3,517,4.354166666666667
628794,4,630328423X,"I've been exercising (strength and aerobic) with exercise videos for about 6 months now and would highly recommend this tape for anyone, either just starting out or at my own level.  Susan modifies throughout the tape,  showing beginners how to perform the exercise.  I love the way Susan  stresses the importance of ""form"" throughout the workout, because  exercising form is many times neglected in some of the other videos I've  seen.
The blending of cardio and strength training (one minute  strength, 3 minute cardio) makes the time fly, you're never bored and work  up a good sweat.  The only negative aspect of this video was what another  reviewer commented on -- the camera angle will focus in on Susan's face and  shoulders when I would like to see the exercise being performed.",957744000,,787,4.886363636363637
628795,5,630328423X,"Susan Powter is the Workout Diva of the 90s:  she tapped into the audience of folks who weren't itsy bitsy already...those of us who couldn't lift a leg or an arm without huffing and puffing and giving up only to go back to  the same Food Hell.  I have used all her tapes ever since I first saw her  on one of those informericals screaming, ""Stop the Insanity!""  about 7 years ago.
And, as other reviewers have mentioned, her tapes  really work.  They work with modification and tenacity.  And I especially  love seeing people who look just like me, not the me I will probably never  be (the one who wears a size 2).
Whatever happened to Susan anyway?  I  remember her going bankrupt (bad investments) and then resurfacing a couple  years ago with a book that talked candidly about her alcoholism (she  claimed vitamins ""cured"" her).  If you're reading this Susan:  DO  ANOTHER TAPE!  What do Sally, Jeff, and Penny look like now?",949881600,15,930,4.567073170731708

This video is great because you can get a bit  of a rest from the cardo while doing the strength training, while always  staying within your fitness level. I found it difficult to do the middle  level because for the majority of time they all followed the ""double  time"" routine. Overall, this is a great video for all of us Susan  Powter fans.",947808000,5,508,4.351063829787234
628797,5,630328423X,"This video has changed my life.  I've been doing it now for about 2 months and can actually see RESULTS.  I always had trouble with aerobics, but with the intervals you never get over worked and can keep the pace you want.  I  would recommend this to anyone.  I was about 35 pds over weight when I  purchased this and am on my way back to feeling like I am in control and  confident with my looks.  Get it, you won't be sorry.",945043200,27,426,4.048192771084337
628798,5,630328423X,"I was skeptical when I first bought this tape. Some people told me they thought Susan Powter would be annoying. I think she's great. This is my favorite video. I like everything about it. I like interval training. It's  not boring, good set, good music. I get a total body workout. Her moves are  easy to follow. I highly recommend this tape.

7844093,5,630328423X,"First released in 1994- this is still one of the best, most motivating cardio/step/interval workouts out there. Easy enough for when you have been sedentary and out-of-shape for a long time, it will get you back in the groove. Easy to step up the intensity with higher step, heavier weights, double repetition. Nice little encouraging talk at the end where she says ""see you tomorrow"" - and you actually look forward to it! Nice gateway to higher fitness and more intense workout videos- but always nice to come home to, mix up with different modalities like yoga, etc. Very revitalizing, doesnt exhaust you, motivates you to want to add more activity to your day just because you feel so energized.",1389830400,5,699,4.833333333333333
