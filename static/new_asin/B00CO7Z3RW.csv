  I was always a big fan of Shane Douglas. He did his best work in ECW. His Dean Douglas Gimmick in WWE was terrible he was doomed to fail. His WCW time was not too bad but if you can make Jeff Jarrett, David Arquete, and Vince Russo WCW Champion you can make Shane Douglas Champion.

  Like I said his best time was in ECW he had great matches in ECW and left ECW when it was time to walk away. I enjoyed his promos and matches. I thought he was a very under appreciated and overlooked wrestler.  He was one of the main guys to make ECW. It hurt when he left and I wish he would have stayed but it was clear his tenure had come to a close and in WCW they were giving out big money contracts to any wrestler to help shift the ratings in Monday Night War so he probably was right to walk away and get a chance to provide for his family better.

  But Douglas had some great matches. One of my favorite was with Bam Bam. Of course The Triple Threat Match with Sabu and Funk was great. Any work he did with Funk was classic. I remember watching ECW at 2 in the morning and Shane having an awesome match with Funk. Douglas and Sandman had many great matches. Shane and Foley had some real great matches. Raven and Shane were always putting on good matches and together great work.

  In the End it's clear Shane Douglas was The Face and Franchise of ECW from day one and helped build it into the company it became and he left his mark that people still revist his ECW career and matches 16 years after he left ECW. You were the Best Shane! Cheers and Enjoy!",1439942400,,4512,4.47921760391198
