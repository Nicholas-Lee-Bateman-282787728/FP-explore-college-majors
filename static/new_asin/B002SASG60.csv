Andrews DVD Review: ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA, was performed on the 14th December, 1986, in front of 11,000 people in the Sydney Entertainment Centre, and was the last in a series of twenty-seven performances covering the whole of Australia. The tour had begun in Brisbane and had played to capacity audiences everywhere, including Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.

The first half of the show features Sir Elton John and his 13-piece band, on the last night of the tour. The second half of the concert features the 88-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The whole show at the time was also being televised live and via satellite, to an estimated audience of over 10 million.

This rare recorded live concert really captures not only a remarkable performance, but a pivotal moment in the life and career of an artist. This 2003 DVD release ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA and the 88-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra which turns 25 years of age, and documents some totally amazing music as well as a legendary night when  Sir Elton John stared down the destruction of his voice and career, and won.

Throughout his late 1986 tour of Australia, which featured both a traditional rock set and full orchestral set each night, Sir Elton John had suffered pain and vocal difficulties due to polyps on his vocal cords. His surgery to remove those polyps occurred just weeks after the close of the tour, in early January 1987. As he performed this show on the tours final nights, he had no idea whether his surgery would leave him with the ability to sing at all, let alone to perform at a rock superstar level again.

Knowing this, and having serious problems throughout the previous night, Sir Elton John went on to perform a legendary set, with a level of commitment and passion that spoke to his fragile state, but despite this slight set back, it doesnt sound like he has a damaged voice; it sounds more intense, more emotional. This has been called the last recording on which Sir Elton John used his old register, as the surgery and aging have brought his voice down a few octaves while adding a new soulful depth to its timber. But the transition seems to be beginning here; you can hear Sir Elton John leaning harder into the notes, finding new phrasing for songs hed performed nightly for years, determined to wring every last drop of emotion and power out of this music.

Sir Elton John is backed by a full symphony orchestra under the leadership of James Newton Howard, who also contributed some of the orchestral arrangements. James Newton Howard would go on to become a hugely successful film composer, working closely with James Cameron on such blockbusters as Titanic and Avatar. For Sir Elton Johns Australia shows, James Newton Howard developed warm, lush and dynamic arrangements of some of Sir Elton Johns signature tunes, including Take Me to the Pilot and Don't Let the Sun Go down on Me. But when he gets to sing Candle in the Wind I started to get very emotional, as it took me tight back to the very emotional broadcast of the final journey of Diana, Princess of Wales and her public funeral on 6th September, 1997, where the official ceremony was held at Westminster Abbey in London, where During the service, Sir Elton John sang ""Candle in the Wind"" which had been re-written in tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales.

But in the end, Sir Elton John's sincerely expressed affection for such a loyal audience, after all the past turbulent years, completed a circle of gratitude that might easily sustain an 18th or 20th return. ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA is an emotional turning point for Sir Elton John, both personally and artistically. Its the music of a man facing real pain and overcoming it while the world watches and listens in.

DVD Video Quality  This ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA Region Free DVD picture is about average for this 1986 concert and the image quality does have some very grainy image at the start of the concert, especially with all the smoke drifting about the stage, and the images can sometimes now and again can seem a little bit on the soft side, but again that is because of the age of the material that was available at the time, and is of course overall a very average looking picture for this DVD, especially with the technology at the time when the concert was recorded by the Australian ABC Television broadcast in 1986. But as the concert progresses the image does settle down to give as best an image that can only be produced by a DVD. So what a shame they could not re-issue this concert onto a Blu-ray disc, as it would be well worth it. There are no subtitles available.

DVD Audio Quality  This ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA Region Free DVD brings you this amazing 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround audio presentation which is very solid and helps to compensate for the slightly average video presentation. The musical accompaniment comes through very clear and there is a good amount of dynamic range from both Sir Elton Johns 13-piece band; and even more dramatic sounds with the second half of the concert with the 88-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. All in all this audio presentation is great for a DVD disc, especially with its inherent video limitation. Despite it only registering Stereo on the front panel of my Pioneer A/V Receiver, but when set for Dolby Surround Sound, you do get very good pronounced ambient sounds in my rear speakers.

Finally, ELTON JOHN: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA concert took place on the 14th December, 1986 and was in my opinion one of the most significant concerts in his career, especially that you could not detect that problem with his voice, which sums up this real trouper and totally professional performer throughout his career and despite the previous night problems, Sir Elton John somehow through a miracle did not lose his voice that night, and if there had been a problem, then the concert would not have been as significant as it was and the full magical experience is captured here with this brilliant DVD for all to see for everyone in the future. Sir Elton John of course went onto do lots more concerts around the world that can be seen with all this other Blu-ray and DVD releases, which gives the same recognition with all of Sir Elton John fantastic highly entertaining and professional concerts. Highly Recommended!

8379290,4,B002SASG60,"This one of Elton Johns best concert videos.  His incredible talent as one of the best pianist ever is shown in this concert. With Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, some of his best songs like The Greatest Discovery are better than ever. Is a must to have this have this with your Elton collection.",1394582400,,294,4.653846153846154
8379291,4,B002SASG60,"I've had the VHS copy of this concert for years, and was really looking forward to a DVD version to come out.  I was pleased with this product.  My only regret is that this did not have the entire concert as the VHS edition did.  This concert was recorded just prior to Elton having laser surgery on his vocal chords, and his condition is shockingly apparent on the first song (One Horse Town).  As this DVD was culled from several concerts at the Sydney Auditorium, his vocal performance improved.
The best cuts on the DVD are the selections with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.  Especially the older songs arranged by Paul Buckmaster.  Elton at his finest!

This is definitely a great addition to your Elton collection!!",1393286400,3,724,4.744
8379292,5,B002SASG60,This was one of Elton's last concerts before he had throat surgery. His voice is rough in spots. He still manages to put on an outstanding show. Both his band and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra are amazing. Video is a must for any Elton John fan.,1360281600,5,248,4.413043478260869
8379293,4,B002SASG60,"I found this a very entertaining concert. Elton was obviously revisiting the glam/glitter years with outrageous costumes and stage antics on this tour for a final time before he pretty much mellowed out into the 90's.
The dvd itself is made up of two concerts back to back. The first being with an enormous band and brass section show casing his rockier tunes and the latter with orchestra highlighting the more classical backed pieces.
Experiencing throat problems, Elton would eventually go on to have throat surgery shortly after finishing the tour. These vocal problems are most evident in the first two songs in which he struggles to contend with a raw battered voice but rescues the performance with an outstanding extended bluesy version of Rocket Man after which things look to running on par again. Daniel and Bennie and the Jets also deserve a mention as I found myself listening them when normally they would have been skipped.
The first section is one hell of a rock concert but for some reason the crowd seems very much dead or perhaps that's just Australian audience.
The second part is the real gem here. Beautifully orchestrated songs like 60 Years On and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me come to life. It's a real tragedy there isn't a 5.1 surround sound mix on this dvd and it's what I found most disappointing.
As you might already be aware this is not an official release but a previous laserdisc transfer onto DVD so the video quality is not standard but isn't all too bad as I've see much worse 80's concert transfers doing the rounds... The cover is also misleading as it mentions there is surround sound however all you get is dolby 2 channel stereo.

The Extra's are quite interesting. There is an option called Lyrics under audio option on main menu that allows you to select the track list and displays the lyrics of the song that is playing with various slides of the concert in the background.

As I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed this dvd despite the less than standard quality. The performance makes up for any draw backs except for the surround sound that I was really looking forward to. Oh Well you can't have it all.
At least now I have the video to go along with the Live In Australia album I love so much.",1354924800,6,2735,4.506048387096774
