8165223,1,6304075251,"THIS IS THE LAMEST COLLECTION OF EPISODES EVERY ASSEMBLED.  ""OBSESSION"" RANKS AS ONE OF THE WORST EPISODES EVER MADE.  IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH ""THE APPLE"" A BETTER CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN  ""ARENA"" OR ""THE ENTERPRISE INCIDENT"" OR EVEN ""WHOM  GODS DESTROY"" ( A GOOD ONE ) REGARDING TNG ""GAMBIT"" IS OKAY  BUT I WOULD SUGGEST ""BEST OF BOTH WORLDS"" OR ""CHAIN OF  COMMAND"" // THE DS9 AND VOYAGER EPISODES ARE NO BETTER.  HOW CAN THEY  EVEN QUALIFY THOSE SHOWS AS STAR TREK. VOYAGER IS ESPECIALLY BAD.  WHO DOES  JANEWAY THINK SHE IS KIDDING?  IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN GOOD STAR  TREK EPISODES I RECOMMEND ACQUIRING THEM INDIVIDUALLY.  GOOD  RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE TOS:  ENTERPRISE INCIDENT;  WHOM GODS DESTROY;  MIRROR, MIRROR; WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE; AND A PIECE OF THE ACTION.  TNG RECOMMENDATIONS:  BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, THE PEGASUS, DESCENT I & II,  Q WHO, AND ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END. I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VOYAGER  OR DS9.  YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A WEAK SHOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO COPY THE OLD STAR  TREK (TRIBBLES) TO MAKE DECENT RATINGS.  VOYAGER NEEDS TO BE CANCELED ASAP.  IN SUMMARY PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE THIS COLLECTION.  YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU  DO . . .",954979200,10,1173,4.622549019607843
