4896505,5,B005V3LIRK,"This was a wonderfully atmospheric and haunting film with a breakout performance by Florence Pugh. If you enjoy beautifully shot and evocative film making with a twist of magic realism, The Falling will more than keep you riveted to the screen. Obviously, this a polarizing movie but it's worth taking a chance on. Take the leap.",1439164800,6,329,4.892857142857143
4896506,1,B005V3LIRK,"Sad to see Maisie Williams caught up in this confusing, pretentious attempt at The Crucible meets The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Renting it was a waste of $7. Buy yourself a latte instead.",1439164800,4,188,4.5588235294117645
4896507,2,B005V3LIRK,"I hoped this would be an eerie one to watch on a Friday night. Sunday afternoon with my Bridge team would've been a more fitting setting. How could a movie with repressed girls amidst a fainting epidemic be so dull? It was a major struggle to focus attention on what was happening for much of it. My focus kept wandering about my living room. The girls are good, though. Maisie Williams is terrific, as you're well aware of if you watch ""Game of Thrones."" It's not terrible and I probably would've appreciated it more under different viewing circumstances but I question whether the film was worth all the skinned knees it caused when the scenes of these girls fainting had to be shot. Their legs would've required emergency amputation at the end of the shoot if Kubrick had directed.",1439164800,3,784,4.64748201438849
4896508,4,B005V3LIRK,"It was a decent film. Liked the ending especially. Several questions are left hinted at but without any definitive answers, adding to the film's artistic taste.",1439164800,,160,5.1923076923076925
4896509,3,B005V3LIRK,"Despite being excited about this film and the premise behind it, I must admit I did not love it. It was very slow and with a myriad of nuances, but all in all I just didn't enjoy it. Acting was decent and some really beautiful, cool camera shots, but that's about the best I can say for it.",1457568000,,290,4.017241379310345
4896510,1,B005V3LIRK,"Super disappointed in this film. The plot didn't know whether it was about the mental strain on Lydia from her friend's passing, the mysterious fainting at the school, or the terribly ill-defined family tension. The teachers were completely unaffected by students passing out even before they suspected kids were faking which makes them terrible people or the script unrealistically written. The ""fainting"" illness was inconsistent and evolved toward the end to not even involving fainting at all. What the heck?? The score was repetitious and pretentious and I was going to tear my own eardrums out if they started that weird xylophone song one.more.time. Overall, this is $6 and 90 minutes of my life I would love to get back.",1456531200,,728,5.075
4896511,4,B005V3LIRK,"This movie is good for the most part, great in the first part. Unlike most movies of this genre, Carol Mosley has the guts to show the audience a lesbian relationship in it's first stages. Lydia (A TERRIFIC portrayal by Maisie Williams of Game of Thrones) is a student in a strict British girl's school in 1969. Her ""best friend"", Abbie Mortimer (Florence Pugh-Another breakout performance) is the school's ""popular"" girl. Abbie and Lydia vow to meet in front of the school's old tree for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately for Lydia, that doesn't happen, due to circumstances you'll just have to watch the movie to see. It's a pretty damn good movie, well worth the rental fee to watch.",1456272000,2,691,4.7190082644628095
4896512,4,B005V3LIRK,"Interesting film, which promised a tad more than it delivered ... This may be a matter of taste, however, as many reviewers think it is one of the best films of the year.",1454457600,,170,4.181818181818182
4896513,3,B005V3LIRK,"THE FALLING is another film that I heard about courtesy of Mark Kermode, who quite liked it if I recall. Too bad I can't say the same myself. I'm all for ambiguous stories as long as the filmmakers provide some key as to what they're trying to say. This felt like they didn't try at all in that regard, so I was left confused as to why things were happening most of the time. The basic plot is that a girl, Abby (Florence Pugh) meets a tragic end at a British boarding school for girls, and then other girls at the school start having these fainting spells. From what I gather, the filmmakers may have been trying to comment on the sexually repressive atmosphere of 1960's England, as seen through the eyes of girls just entering puberty at that time. However, nothing is really explained and I can't quite forgive the film for that, as I feel my time was slightly wasted. There was also a really weird incestuous relationship between a girl and her brother, which was rather off-putting. Still, despite the weakness of the writing, the performances were really good and the film looked gorgeous. I was particularly impressed with Maisie Williams (who some will know from GAME OF THRONES), who brought depth and a youthful angst to her character. Overall, I can't see the average moviegoer getting much out of this one. Even for me, who normally jumps at the opportunity to watch a film that makes me think, I felt a little cheated. I wouldn't go so far to say this is a bad film, per se, but quite possibly the only falling that happens will be when you fall asleep.",1453507200,3,1567,4.5017543859649125

4896517,3,B005V3LIRK,"The Falling is about a girls school in the 60s with the relationship between Abigail (Susan Pugh) and Lydia(Maisie Williams),two dominant personalities, who have their own cult of female love and adoration of each others musings and thoughts. Abigail worships poetry, quoting Wordsworth in particular, vowing to meet under an oak tree the same day every year for the rest of their lives. Abbie is more sexually advanced and had sex with a young man because he had a fast car, becoming pregnant. She also has sex with Lydia brother. Kenneth, whos into the occult. Lydia feels in awe of Abbies greater knowledge of life. Abbie faints,has a seizure and soon dies. The school sets up in memory of Abbie a poetry prize. They all regale how talented and marvellous she was. The teachers are the ever smoking head Miss Alvarro, the young art teacher, and Saccis prude. The girls start feinting too, following Lydias lead, one by one and in groups, and a young teacher. Lydia is now the popular leader with her own personality cult, who her peers obey against the authorities, using feinting as a form of rebellious protest,she fakes. Lydias own problems stem from an agoraphobic, hairdresser mother(Maxine Peake), from whom the cold winds of indifference blow and eccentric standoffishness from the world and Lydias own strange birth. I loved the use of established older stars like Peake and Sacci.

The film had my attention for the 1st 50 minutes with its fine editing, cinematography, and musical soundtracks. It had superb shots of nature to offset the girls rhapsodies and enthusiasms. However the episodes of the mass feinting were suspiciously like being in a psychiatric hospital in an all female ward. Jung is quoted, the psychologist attempts to bring a little order to proceedings, questioning each girl after a mass feinting episode. We get dropped in the idea of mass hysteria, the wandering female womb, the adolescent sexual longings of the female mind. But the idea of one female with personality disorder(Lydia) with her obsessive wink affecting the whole school seemed to be more in keeping with this film. I liked the fact that one pupil, the Asian girl, doesnt succumb to the mass hypnosis, and reasons it away. I felt like the Asian girl, who wasn't falling for the hokum. I liked this film despite reservations and look forward to Carol Morleys films in the future.",1452038400,,2381,4.937655860349127

4896520,1,B005V3LIRK,"To paraphrase Judge JD, this is the most boringest movie ever. I couldn't even make it to an hour in. It's about a bunch of mopey, dull prep school girls. They stand around and pick at the walls. The other 1-star reviews here are no joke. I love great filmmaking, great storytelling, this isn't it.",1451347200,,298,4.4363636363636365

4896525,4,B005V3LIRK,"I found this movie as an admirer of Maisie Williams, and I am certainly not disappointed by how she pulls off the difficulty of her role. The idea of the movie is certainly quite intriguing, and it has served as a great conversation piece as to whether the condition her character exemplifies is real or how it may be viewed. As some others have said, toward the end the narrative seems to become a bit disjointed and it loses some of its intrigue, but the exposition is still comprehensible and keeps the movie enjoyable as a good psychological study as well as cultural view of this traditional-like British school setting.",1441843200,,625,4.6909090909090905

4896527,5,B005V3LIRK,"An expertly done human drama with terrific ambiance and artistry set in an all girls public school in England in 1969. Introspective and intense Lydia (Maisie Williams- best known for her role in Game of Thrones) is best friends with popular and outgoing Abbie (Florence Pugh) and they inscribe each other name on an oak tree vowing eternal sisterhood.
After Abbie falls pregnant as a result of a liaison with Lydia's horrible sex obsessed brother Kenneth (Joe Cole) who dabbles in the occult, Lydia fears for her relationship with Abbie. Add to the mix some nasty narrow minded teachers determined to force their Victorian morality on the girls (this at the time of the sexual revolution- and opening of the 60s) - Greta Scacchi plays the austere Miss Mantell, and Lydia's reclusive mother (Maxine Peak) this is a coming of age movie, a psychological thriller , a supernatural thriller all in one.
A tragedy at the school leads to the girls having collective fainting spells- is it mass hysteria or is their a supernatural explanation? We won't know half the questions posed by this movie. From the artisicc beginning to the heartbreaking end it certainly held my attention.
Highly recommended the girls were all great -Mention also gos to Anna Burnett as flame haired head prefect Susan. ambiance intriguing, background haunting and music fabulous",1441065600,5,1349,5.026785714285714
4896528,4,B005V3LIRK,"Set in the 1960s at an all girl school we meet Lydia (Masie Williams) who has a best friend in Abbie. They have it all as friends and a love of nature centring around an old oak tree. They have a mixed bag of teachers who seem to adhere to Victorian values and modesty principles - that is despite the burgeoning `summer of love'.

Then tragedy happens and Masie starts to have fainting fits - very soon the phenomenon spreads and she seems to be at the centre of it. Throw in a mum with issues (Maxine Peake) and a bit of the Occult, forbidden sex and deep rooted paranoia and you have the makings of a rather good story.

Maxine Peake is billed starring here, but she is not really on screen for a great period of time; Greta Scacchi as the dowdy Miss Mantel is though pure excellence in a performance dripping with understatement. I have seen comparisons to `Picnic at Hanging Rock' and even the events around Salem and the subsequent Witch trials. However, I think such comparisons may lead to expectations that may not be met. It is though a film that had a great idea and I think it could have been taken much further as it sort of peters out; despite that it is still on I can recommend.",1440892800,3,1194,4.302222222222222
8487253,2,B005V3LIRK,"Very slow & incredibly dull. A lot of the acting was downright bad, not b level movie terrible, but not good for sure. I haven't watched game of thrones so this is the first I'm seeing of Maisie Williams. Not sure if it was her or the character that I found so annoying & not at all watchable. The character progression of Lydia's mother was too sudden & felt forced. It was like the movie wandered aimlessly then suddenly realized 90 minutes in that they had to come up with a conclusion. I'm giving two stars only because of the beautiful shots of the pond and the school surroundings.",1529798400,,587,4.394495412844036
