8362329,1,B00000J318,"Hey everyone, Stay away from this video.  It has been over a year since my first review and I am here to tell you that you are wasting your time and money on this video.  Moreover, all of the reviewers listed (except me) rate videos by Mr. Lyons as great or good videos.  Once again, these reviewers are either hired by Mr. Lyons or they are Mr. Lyons writing under an assumed name to promote his poor product.  Don't be fooled!",1188086400,,428,4.246913580246914
8362330,1,B00000J318,"This is an update to my previous review which stated: There were two major problems with this video. First, as a martial artist, many of the items outlined were very much impractical. Second, the video itself was not a professional production; it looks as if it was shot on a home video camera. Personally, I would not waste my time on this video. If you are looking for practical self-defense, I strongly encourage you to look at tapes dealing with Aikido, Jujitsu, or Hapkido.
Since that first review and upon further analysis, all of the reviewers, with the exception of me, appear to be linked to the following interrelated group of individuals:  Bob Klein, Robert Lyons, and Jean Goulet.  Before you spend your money on this video, review all of the individuals who rated this video.  One of the reviewers is Bob Klein, who is in the video; talk about self promotion!  In short, all of the reviewers are biased and I strongly encourage that you not waste your money as I did!",1081036800,2,980,4.6473988439306355

8362332,5,B00000J318,"I love this video because it is just like being in a class.  There are a great variety of techniques shown and the students are taught the proper  way to use each technique.  The teacher takes the time and care to explain  everything carefully and to demonstrate how to do it correctly.  There is  punching, kicking, grappling, groundfighting and more.  I hightly recommend  this video to learn to protect yourself in the street.",962755200,2,429,4.780821917808219
8362333,5,B00000J318,"This was a lot more than I expected.  The teacher really goes into detail and explains how to use the other person's force against them.  There are so many techniques shown and basic principles taught.  Each one is gone  over & over again with the students until they ""get it"" - and  you can see how the principles work when applied correctly.  Mr. Klein  teaches well and there's a lot to learn here.  It is, indeed, practical.",957830400,2,428,4.467532467532467
8362334,5,B00000J318,"This video teaches you how to defend yourself against an opponent who is larger and stronger than you.  You will see classroom instruction in which students are being shown the techniques and carefully corrected so they  (and you) understand the body mechanics behind the techniques.  Included  are: punching, kicking, groundfighting, grappling and protection against  being attacked with a stick.  You will need a partner to practice this.  These are typical situations you will encounter on the street.  The  techniques are derived from T'ai-chi-Ch'uan (""The Grand Ultimate  Martial Art"") and include evasive maneuvers and unexpected ways of  dealing with force, to allow the force to go by and be neutralized.  It is  very good for children and for anyone not used to defending themselves.",955843200,6,792,5.341463414634147
