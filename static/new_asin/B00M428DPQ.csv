6554889,5,B00M428DPQ,"Osipova is absolutely stunning:  technically, needless to mention, she is absolutely superior, but her amazing acting gives new life to the role.

I noticed I used the word ""absolutely"" twice, subsequently. In describing Osipova's art ""absolutely"" simply comes so naturally... I believe she is  giving another meaning to the term ""prima ballerina assoluta"", as well. Or, let's say she has become an ""assoluta prima ballerina assoluta"" :-))",1425427200,9,439,5.522388059701493

6554892,5,B00M428DPQ,"This new DVD from Opus Arte of ""Giselle,"" one of Adolphe Adam's famous works, is heartily welcomed. The two stars are Natalia Osipova as Giselle and Carlos Acosta as Albrecht. Everything about it seems to to me to be beyond criticism. There is some competition however. A quick (though not exhaustive) web search for purchasable DVDs retrieved five: an old performance with Rudolph Nureyev and Carla Fracci; a different performance by Carla Fracci with the American Ballet Theatre; a 1980 version by the National Ballet of Cuba with Alicia Alonso and Valdimir Vasiliev; a 2006 Royal Opera House (London) version with Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg; and a 2005 version issued as a boxed set from the Teatro alla Scala that also includes a 2004 performance of ""Swan Lake"" and a 2011 performance of ""Raymonda."" (If you find more versions please don't write to tell me!) I also found five versions on You Tube: Dutch National Ballet, undated, excellent but not HD; La Scala, 2005, very good but not HD; La Scala, 1996, good but not HD; Bolshoi, 1998, fair; Brazil, undated, poor.
Lovers of this Adolphe Adam classic should be happy to add this version to their collection!

8670144,5,B00M428DPQ,"I did expet Osipova to be something special. She definitely didn't disappoint me! However, despite having seen a few Giselles - this is the first time I've found Myrtha to be that frigthening and ice cold Wili that everyone talks about. She finally made me understand what Myrtha is about! What a gem! Definitely one of the best (perhaps the best?) Ballet DVD in my collection!",1460937600,,377,4.7272727272727275
8670145,5,B00M428DPQ,"I agree with everything that has been written here about Osipova but I want to write about Albrecht. I have seen many Giselles on stage and TV and never cried before. In the end of this performance Albrecht stands in the middle of the stage with Giselle's white rose elevated as the priest does after the consecration of the species in the Mass. This scene was so touching and heart breaking that I had to cry. To compare, I played Roberto Bolle's Scala version. Of course, Bolle is a very handsome man and also a magnificent dancer, but in the very end he kneels down and drops the rose and then the curtain is lowered too soon. I was also very much impressed about Peter Wright's information bout Giselle having commited suicide. I never heard about this before, but it is very logical to me. I always wondered why Giselle's tomb is found in such a solitary place and the reason is that she could not be buried in a consecrated place having killed herself.",1458777600,7,958,4.48

8670147,5,B00M428DPQ,"I have seen Giselle many times both on stage and through DVDs. However, I must say that this production with Natalia Osipova as Giselle has got to be one of the best! Ms. Osipova is breathtaking in the lead role and definitely is up there with famous ballerinas who have danced as Giselle (i.e., Markova,, Fonteyn, Kirkland, etc). I saw this production on the big screen (movie theater) and fell in love with it!. If you love classical ballet then you will love this production!",1449014400,4,478,4.635294117647059

Her acting is deeply emotional. This is a DVD you can keep and cherish for a life time. Best of the best!",1435276800,6,263,4.617021276595745
