Once the three college students enter the twilight zone around After Dark, you  are propelled into an atmospheric and seedy world. The art direction and  photography is well done, the urban night scenes being lit by pools of  orange and blue to great effect. The cockroach-chewing night club manager  will make you laugh. If, like me, you enjoy this kind of late-night romp,  dim the lights, buy a six-pack and enjoy 'Vamp'.",920505600,3,565,5.032258064516129
845645,5,6304282699,"I cant put into words just how excited I am about the films Arrow and MVD are releasing on Blu-ray.  Many of those released in the past have been titles I consider classics, and yet there have been many I have never seen before as well.  The diversity is impressive, as are the HD transfers and bonus features that accompany each film.

One of their more recent releases is the 80s blood-sucker movie VAMP, starring the incomparable Grace Jones.  VAMP is a film you simply have to see to appreciate.  It is darkly funny, but its also a heck of a vampire film.  And while not necessarily scary, it is certainly a worthy addition to the undead film canon.

Grace Jones is undeniably one of the best actresses who has ever portrayed a vampire onscreen.  Her sensuality combined with subtle animalistic traits she uses onscreen make a frightening yet inviting character.  This terrifying combination creates the perfect vampire queen.

VAMP is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The HD transfer is impressive, particularly when compared to the VHS version.  I remember watching this two decades ago and being frustrated with the graininess of the low-light shots.  The Blu-ray takes care of that problem, offering a nice, clean picture.

The acting is great, with Chris Makepeace and Robert Rusler in the leading roles.  Makepeace is a familiar face, as I remember him from MEATBALLS and Rona Jaffes MAZES AND MONSTERS, two films I frequented in my younger years.  And Rusler is VERY familiar to me because hes been in many movies Ive loved over the years, including WEIRD SCIENCE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2, THRASHIN, and Stephen Kings SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK.  Supporting cast includes Billy Drago, who has to be one of the hardest working B-movie actors in history, and Dedee Pfeiffer, whose filmography is as diverse as Samuel L. Jacksons.  Despite everybody mentioned above, Grace Jones steals the limelight; her onscreen presence is intoxicating, and she highlights every scene in which she appears.

The special effects in VAMP look great, and theres some nice carnage amidst the vampire make-up.  I like how the transformation makes the vamps look like monsters instead of just actors with fangs; I feel this is a more accurate depiction of what a blood-sucker would look like (if they were real, of course).

VAMP is another big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Campy sometimes, but always fun, this is one movie youll probably revisit again.",1477958400,,2459,4.888888888888889
845646,4,6304282699,"I've never seen the movie Vamp growing up, so whether or not it actually holds up today, that I can't tell you. What I can tell you, is that the film is a cheesy, funny vampire flick that gets bogged down by pacing issues.

The usually stellar Arrow Video released Vamp on Blu-ray already back in 2014. This latest release is for North American audiences and unfortunately, it removes some of the Blu-ray special features that were in the original release. The biggest feature you're missing out on is the commentary, but they do list a brand-new documentary. Is it worth the purchase? Read on to find out.

MOVIE REVIEW

The story for Vamp is as follows: AJ (Robert Rusler from A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) and Keith (Chris Makepeace) are planning on joining a fraternity and they promised the frat brothers booze, food and a stripper for a party. They have to drive to LA in order to get the stripper, as the University is inexplicably located in the middle of the desert. They scout out some strip clubs and decide on the one called After Dark. They saunter in and proceed to watch the strippers do their wacky routines and try to decide which one would be best to take back to the university. They are unsure of who it will be until the craziest strip teaser ever comes on stage, Grace Jones with orange hair and white body paint. She gyrates around and humps a chair and for some reason, everyone in the audience is loving it.  I do not really know why, but I'm actually enjoying it as well (I know, I feel weird).

AJ thinks she is the one and goes backstage to ask her to go back to the university with them. He meets up with her and she jumps all over him and then the big reveal happens, she's a vampire!

Once AJ doesn't show back up, Keith becomes worried, but not so worried that he doesn't have time to hang out with one of the girls working at the strip club, who reckons she remembers him from when they were younger. (This little side story doesn't really add anything to the story, but it does give us plenty of time with the cute Dedee Pfeiffer). Keith also has another friend with him named Duncan, played by Gedde Watanabe, who you'll probably know from Sixteen Candles. He seems to be playing the same kind of character. He's a bit of a weird nerd and has lots of money and really, he just wants to get wasted and watch the strippers (Duncan, you the man!)

Keith keeps trying to find AJ, but ends up running around in a city that looks like Joel Schumacher decorated it, as everything looks straight out of a comic book with plenty of purple, green and blue.  Eventually, Keith runs into an Albino gang that end up chasing him into the sewers.  I know, this is one wacky film.

As for our head vamp of the story, Grace Jones, she, unfortunately, doesn't have a lot to do in the film. She has one weird scene,  one cool vampire scene and then she ends up in the background. She eventually gets to do one more neat scene, but that's all. If she is meant to be some sort of Queen of the vampires, they really failed at conveying that.

Vamp is definitely a product of its time, with the clothing, music and the kind of cheesy humour you would expect from an 80s flick. That's cool, as I love the 80s, but I just felt it did not grasp the full potential of the story and go all out. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be gory special effects film (the SFX is pretty cool) or a low-brow laugh fest. The ending seems like it wanted to choose the latter, as it was terribly cheesy. One word: rainbow. Ugh. The film reveals the cool vampire bits quickly, but then pacing issues rear their ugly head and the films stalls.  Not until over halfway through do things pick back up. More vampires show up and the action/horror ramps up.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Even with all the negatives, I still feel like you should check it out, and the best way to do that is with the new Blu-ray from Arrow video. That is if you do not already own the earlier UK release, which, by the way, was region free. Nevertheless, if you want the new release that just came out, you can expect a cool new cover and a new documentary. The video transfer seems to be the same as the original release. There are times where things are a little blurry and there are issues here and there. It is definitely an older transfer from Arrow. Overall, though, I found the video and audio acceptable.

As for the special features, you have the already mentioned over 40-minute documentary featuring several interviews with cast and crew. Also, we have some rehearsal footage of Grace Jones doing some really weird stuff. Rounding it all out are trailers, TV spots, a blooper reel and a short film by Director Richard Wenk. Sadly, I'm disappointed they ended up dropping most of the features from the original release. I personally think if you can find the UK version, that would be the one to get.

VERDICT

Vamp does hit a lot of the right notes, but it also misses a lot of things as well. They definitely could have gone crazy with the vampire strippers idea, making it a pre-From Dusk till Dawn style film, but unfortunately, they chose not to. Instead, Vamp has a little bit of comedy, a kitschy style story and some troubles with pacing. Nevertheless, there is good to be had with Vamp and it is definitely a movie I will check out again. Whether you decide to pick up the new US release or the older UK release, you can be rest assured that you'll have a worthwhile film/Blu-ray in your hands.",1477267200,,5489,4.3858267716535435
845647,4,6304282699,"Vamp is a horror film set in 1986, when the film was made. Two fraternity pledges, Keith (Chris Makepeace, Meatballs) and AJ (Robert Rusler, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddys Revenge), want to make the right impression at college and so devise a plan to get into the best frat house on campus. They head to the After Dark Club where they hope to find a stripper for a party their friends won't forget. Instead, they find themselves among vampires led by Kinky Katrina (Grace Jones, A View to a Kill).

The plot is similar to From Dusk Till Dawn, made ten years later. In both, innocent travelers inadvertently wander into a nest of vampires in their favored hangout. Though Vamp is not as well known as that film, it has its share of treats. The undead are strippers who know how to lure in tourists, transients, and the unsuspecting, and devour them whole. The movie has the look of vintage EC horror comics like Tales From the Crypt and Vault of Horror. The gore is prolific and graphic, and there is a dark, even twisted sense of humor.

The piece de resistance is Grace Jones portrayal of a vampire queen. Her make-up enhances her already imposing appearance. The movie holds up because of a fast pace, plenty of bloody action, and far above average special effects.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include director Richard Wenks short film Dracula Bites the Dust (1979), behind-the-scenes rehearsals, blooper reel, image gallery, and reversible sleeve containing original and newly commissioned artwork.",1476835200,,1518,4.8307692307692305
845648,5,6304282699,"Horror-comedies were like the peanut butter-n-chocolate of the '80s: packaged for easy consumption, the two genres were a good match for a decade more interested generating laughs than genuine scares.  An American Werewolf in London, Night of the Creeps, even the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was sequelized (quite successfully) as a black comedy rather than a bleak slasher.  Lost in the shuffle was Vamp (1986), produced under Roger Corman's New World banner, which took an almost impossibly puerile set-up - college kids, vampires and strippers - and whipped up something cutesy, colorful and unique.

Prospective fraternity members AJ and Keith (Robert Rusler and Chris Makepeace) head into a sketchy part of downtown L.A. to hire a stripper for an upcoming soiree, catching a ride with wealthy dork (Gedde Watanabe) who hires their friendship for the week.  They quickly identify the club's main attraction, Katrina (Grace Jones), as their first choice.  But Katrina and the rest of the on-stage talent, are actually blood-sucking vampires who feed on the dregs of humanity.  Now our trio of horny college kids is worried not just about getting laid...but getting laid to rest!

Vamp's synopsis is wrapped in the dreck of '80s sex comedies, but in execution it's a much more romantic affair, focusing on a meet-cute relationship between Keith and one of the club's waitressess, Allison (played by a perky Dedee Pfeiffer, Michelle's sister), instead of the expected bumping and grinding.  It's never scary, but there are a number of convincing make-up applications from Greg Cannon alongside some incredibly eye-popping lighting effects from director of photography Elliot Davis.  The film is bathed in green and magenta highlights, inside and out, creating an otherworldly feeling during the club scenes and even on the city streets where our protagonists are pursued by a gang of albino street punks (you just had to be there).

But director Richard Wenk's biggest asset is his cast, including Seinfeld's Sandy Baron as Vic the nighclub manager, whose creatively vulgar stage introductions are delivered with just the right amount of world-weary cynicism, and, of course, Grace Jones who's like a brilliant piece of set design brought to life.  At the heart of it all is Chris Makepeace (Meatballs, My Bodyguard), so comfortable as both the sidekick and a reluctant hero it's shocking he left the profession.

Vamp, like its cast of undead characters, has emerged from the coffin looking better than ever.  Arrow Video's new hi-def transfer does wonders with the color scheme and extras include a comprehensive documentary that gathers all the principal cast and creative members (except for Jones, who we hear was a bit of a diva on set), plus a blooper reel, image gallery, trailers and Richard Wenk's 1979 short Dracula Bites the Big Apple, an amusing musical student spoof that repurposes ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" for a catchy new supernatural sing-along.",1475971200,,2971,5.229473684210526

845652,4,6304282699,"How the hell did this fall under the radar? Maybe opening the same day as James Cameron's masterpiece Aliens had a little to do with it. Its a really good and very fun 80s vampire flick in the style of Fright Night mixed with Night of the creeps (which came out a month later) and Martin Scorsese's great underrated After hours. It has a classic 80s midnight movie look and feel, constantly soaked in a purple and green neon lit atmosphere, that really adds a lot to the fun. To top it off it ends with the great Bobby Rydell song Volare during the end credits that was a really nice touch and has a great selection of songs throughout the movie. Chris Makepeace and Robert Rusler are very good, Grace Jones is also great with what strangely little she has with her ""main villain"" role and the very attractive Dedee Pfeiffer is really enjoyable as well. The movie was unpredictable and had some great surprises. I really liked Vamp a lot and if you are a fan of cult 80s horror/comedy flicks (especially Fright Night and Night of the creeps) give it a shot. It really is a lot of fun if not quite perfect. From Dusk till dawn and Tales from the crypt's Bordello of blood owe quite a bit to this obscure gem. Arrow's new blu ray is fantastic with an excellent new documentary and best of all they fixed the apparent glitch from the previous release! It's flawless now.

Two college students are willing to do anything to join a frat on campus so they agree to bring a stripper to their party.

The atmosphere of the club and its surrounding area is quite eerie and I loved the aesthetics of the film. The make up of the vampires was well done and the characters succeeded in completing the vibe of the place. The main vampire was really disturbing to me. I don't know if it was the face, the bright red hair, the body art, or maybe a combination of all? but she was disgusting to watch. I felt the plot could have been better though. Some of the vampires died off way too easy and with no cleverness in the executions.

846045,4,6304282699,"Vamp, a 1986 feature film, is one of the most underrated films of the 1980's. That decade gave us so much wonderful entertainment that it is hard to believe that many really good movies get lost within the mix that it is really hard to keep track of. While Vamp was not a big box office success and received mostly negative reviews, it happens to be a pretty decent flick and very watchable.

Vamp is really not a horror film in the true sense. It is simply a movie that urban slang would call a horromedy, which means a comedy with a horror film theme.

It all starts when two best friends since childhood, AJ and Keith (Robert Rusler and Chris Makepeace), are being initiated into the most popular fraternity on campus. The whole thing goes awry and when AJ makes a really hard to believe deal that he and his friend can provide anything in the entertainment department for their party, they request that they get a stripper for their party that night and then, they will be automatically in. After a few failed attempts, they decide that a professional stripper is needed and they ask an obnoxious Asian American student named Duncan(Gedde Wantanabe)for a car, providing that they take him along on their field trip despite their objections. While on the way there, they check an entertainment paper and see an ad for the After Dark Club and AJ feels that this is the place that they have been looking for. They first have a run-in with the area gang led by an Albino looking guy named Snow(Billy Drago), which ends with AJ and Keith getting the better of them and using it against them. They arrive at the club some time later, and despite that they feel that Duncan should stay in the car, Duncan winds up going in the club despite their objections and that is when the story really unfolds. Unbeknown to our three young men, the After Dark Club is a hideout for a coven of modern day vampires as every one who works in the club, with the exception of two young ladies, are all vampires led by a queen named Katrina(Grace Jones)and that they might be the next intended victims. AJ feels that after seeing Katrina perform that she is the right stripper for the frat party and decides to talk to her to make the preposition, but winds up getting bitten and after Keith accidently puts a cockroach in his mouth to eat, he decides that enough is enough and wants to go home fraternity or no fraternity as he really didn't care whether he and/or AJ made it into that group in the first place. But later, we see that Keith finds out the truth about the club and also seeing that AJ has now become one of them, he now knows that in order for him to survive, he has to get out of the club and the area immediately. During this time, a young waitress and would be hopeful dancer named Amaretto(Dedee Pfeiffer, who has always stated that Vamp is her all time favorite out of all the films that she has done)tries to get Keith to remember her, but Keith really has no clue as to who she is, until later on when she reveals herself to be an old school mate of his named Allison Hicks. With Amaretto and Duncan, they fight to escape the club after discovering the truth about everyone there. But after discovering that Duncan has also been bit, Keith crashes the car deliberately and it explodes only a few seconds later destroying him. For Keith and Amaretto, it now becomes a fight to survive the night and to stay mortal in the midst of the vampire population in that area. As usual, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it as of yet.

Director and co-writer Richard Wenk effectively blends the elements of horror and comedy to deliver a very fun and entertaining romp. The cast all play their respective roles in the film with class and charisma and also, Grace Jones, though she has no speaking lines in this film, steals the show as the vampire queen Katrina. Her character simply growls, snarls and laughs very wickedly and hysterically, but is very effective and does help to keep the film afloat. Sandy Baron also helps in his performance of Vic, a partner in the club ownership. Gedde Wantanabe, who also appeared in other 1980's films like Sixteen Candles and Gung Ho, is a hoot as the over sexed, obnoxious and narcissistic Asian American guy named Duncan. That and the wonderful soundtrack, make this film an entertaining and fun romp that takes the horror element to the limits and also, you will have a few laughs along the way.

The reception for Vamp wasn't very favorable back in 1986 when the film was released. It didn't really play much in many areas. I don't even remember this film even playing at a theater in my hometown. I still remember the TV spots that did get shown on TV a lot, but still, I don't remember this film ever coming to my hometown as I never really saw it in the local newspapers playing at one of the local theaters. The vast majority of critics didn't like this or maybe, they really didn't understand it at first when it was initially released. So, as a result of that, I didn't get a chance to see it in any movie theater in my hometown as again, I have no recollection of it playing in my hometown.

But on one birthday of mine back in the mid 1990's, a friend of mine bought this for me on VHS as a present and since I had only limited knowledge of the film, I decided to pop this in that very night. This particular VHS tape was the initial re-issue of the movie on VHS by the Starmaker company, that was later bought out by Anchor Bay Entertainment, who also later re-issued this movie on VHS again in 1997 with a theatrical trailer before the film started and also, a small featurette where a few members of the cast and the crew talk about the film and their experiences making it. I popped this movie in my VCR and I actually enjoyed the film immensely. I thought that it was a wonderful and entertaining romp and I actually watched it several times after that. I still enjoy this film and it is one of my favorite movies. The film is a hoot and a holler and worth watching. The film is very watchable and laughable. It is worth renting or even owning if you enjoy movies of this type. It is a fun and entertaining romp.

Yes, the film was not a big success, critically or commercially, but it has since become a cult classic and also, a favorite among everyone who admires the actors who starred in this, especially the legions of Grace Jones fans out there in the world. Though she doesn't have any spoken lines of dialogue in this, she still steals the show as the wicked, but you can't help but love, queen Katrina. She alone is the main reason why this film is worth watching and owning. Grace Jones is a multi-talented performer who sings, writes songs and acts. She is still loved by her legions of fans across the world. I happen to be a fan of hers in my own right as I have several of her albums in my ever growing vinyl collection. The movie, as a whole, is considered a ""guilty pleasure"" amongst it's cult of admirers who love the movie and still do.

This debut DVD release of Vamp by Anchor Bay Entertainment has the film remastered digitally from the original negatives for superb quality. The film is very colorful and the audio sounds terrific. The soundtrack also sounds wonderful.

PROS: There are some wonderful special features. This DVD has several TV spots. The theatrical trailer that was used on the 1997 VHS re-issue. It also has a short film called Dracula Bites The Big Apple, that was also directed by Richard Wenk in 1978, eight years before the making of Vamp. We are also treated with a poster and still gallery. Also, the aforementioned colors and terrific sounding audio and also, the soundtrack sounds wonderful. The commentary track is also very entertaining, as the director and a few of the film's stars talk about the film and their experiences making the film.

CONS: While the aforementioned special features make this DVD a treasure, it doesn't reissue the short featurette that was issued on the 1997 VHS re-issue by Anchor Bay Entertainment. If that were included with all of those above aforementioned special features, it would have made this THE definitive DVD issue. Since this has gone out of print, it has been re-issued on DVD by other company's and it is also available on Blu-Ray.

Overall, Vamp is one of the most underrated films of the 1980's and is a very satisfying film in many ways. It is a very fun and entertaining romp that can be watched more than once and enjoyed again and again. It is well worth renting and even owning, especially if you admire any of the films stars and even Grace Jones fans will be satisfied. It is fun if you love horror movies or comedy movies or both. If you haven't gotten this film yet, by all means get it. No horror or comedy fan, or even Grace Jones fan, should be without it.",1326240000,3,8865,4.449846153846154

Here is a great, but forgotten Vampire/black comedy from 1986. Grace Jones (she's scary enough anyway) is the head Vampire in a strip club filled with Vampires. Chris Makepeace, who looks just like a young Mel Gibson, & his buddies are looking for a stripper for a frat party. What ensues is great comedy/horror entertainment, as Chris finds out, he & his friends have entered a nest of Vampires & try to escape with their juglar veins intact!

Smart & witty dialog, great editing, convincing make up, a director with love for the genre, & great chase scenes make this one of the better Vampire films of the 80's! A direct precedent for ""Dusk til Dawn!'",1323302400,,672,4.591666666666667

Over the years I have become an advocate of those in peril, of those who are fighting a losing battle, and of those actors and movies that you never seem to see anymore. Sort of a ""Dead-Poet-Society"" theme, if you will, exist in my movie collection. As I move forward into the nether-reaches of my life...my late 40's... I find I miss many things, both remembered and forgotten. They say 'all things old, are new again',  and that is certainly the case with Hollywood. They can't seem to re-make enough old movies. Or in other words, they have no original ideas from which to create new work. PITY! Sometimes I think I could do better. Remembering a movie like Vamp is easy. Just close your eyes and think of a beautiful, young  naked black woman. Confident and aggressive, powerful in form, and completely no-fat and sugar-free. Grace Jones is a must for any and all collectors who appreciate determination, self-confidence, and overt sexually. This movie is a bit campy and dated, but I love this era. Big- hair, neon-colored everything, and the dominatrix Grace Jones made the 80's a fun fabulous time to be alive.",1271894400,2,1150,4.7164179104477615

846126,4,6304282699,"There's a shocker huh?  No offense to you strippers out there.  Your ""victims"" get what they have coming to them; empty wallets!  Strangely, the vampires/strippers in this film are much more selective.  I can't say that was a big problem with this film.  Oh, it had problems for sure, but none of them stopped me from actually liking this movie.  Let's shimmy into it shall we...

-WE GREATLY DESIRE TO HANG WITH YOU DORKS.
This is the set-up for the whole movie.  It goes like this:
Two guys trying to join a fraternity of ritualistic dorks decide they are too cool to follow the rituals.  Despite this, they are still willing to go to great lengths to gain entry into the dorky club.  The Dorks agree to allow entry into the club if the ""too cool"" newbs throw a wild party for them, including strippers.  So begins the quest that leads our ""too cool"" heroes into the depth of the inner city.  If you don't have a problem with this set-up, then you actually have a chance to enjoy the movie because it doesn't get any better.  I thought it was pretty darn funny in a stupid way.

-GRACE JONES SUCKS AND BITES ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
This is why she does not get any lines.  In all honesty, I never got what the big attraction was with her anyway.  She's pretty darn creepy without the makeup (and couldn't fill a training bra).  Despite my shallow commentary I got along fine with grace in this film.  Being pre-creepy, she makes an appropriate queen vamp stripper.  Character actor Sandy Baron (a guy) carries the day for the bad guys as he does a fine job of playing the inexplicably dumb nightclub manager.
 On the side of niceness are the young people.  Robert Rusler has his charisma smeared all over us.  You would never buy any of his lines, but everyone else does.  His buddy is Chris Makepeace (John Makewar's stepbrother?) a wimpy, benign bundle of nerves who knuckles under to his pals every whim.  Geddy Watanabe plays another dork that will pay for anything (just a little convenient).  The pre-requisite nice girl is Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle's flat-chested sister... ...WHAT!?!?).  Her place in this film keeps you guessing because it defies reason.  The entire cast is exactly what you would expect from a 80s teenage, semi-light, horror film; just better than adequate.

-REMOVING TONGUE FROM CHEEK AND GETTING SERIOUS
I think what kept me in this film was the whole feel of the thing.  As dopey as the setup sounds, this is a very surreal and nightmarish experience.  I really had a sense of weariness as the good guys languished in their sugar coated human flytrap.  Time keeps passing and things just keep getting more and more messed up but nobody but our bundle of nerves seems to be in a hurry to get out.  Have you ever had a nightmare where someone is chasing you, but you can't move?  That's how this starts to feel.  Well, eventually everything hits the fan and our hero starts to move.  But even then, he ends up on a treadmill.  You begin to doubt that there is actually an ending to this movie.  Not surprisingly, a semi-cheap ending is devised and we get a fair conclusion.  However, lot's of implausible but fun action occurs along the way.

-OH, PRETTY COLORS!
I especially liked the over-the-top production values of this film.  The vampire makeup is monstrous and grotesque, not just a couple fangs.  The lighting is like a Halloween stage show with purples and greens and oranges. The sets are limited but effective (how much do you expect to see when you're trapped in a nightmare?).  I happen to like this somewhat campy look.  Visually, this is a fun film.

-PUTTING TOUGUE BACK IN CHEEK TO TALK ABOUT THE STORY.
If you've made it this far still believing you will enjoy this movie then you are ready to face the final test; a story full of inexplicable stupidity and hyper-ridiculous caveats to make things work.  This is a 1980s teenage horror film after all.  It is in the same mood as ""Fright Night"" but not nearly as well thought out.  If you don't laugh at and enjoy solutions to problems nearly falling into our heroes lap then you won't like this story.  You might even suspect that some of the vampires in this film wanted to die; it's that bad.  All that said, I fell on the side of enjoying the stupidity of it all.  This film is not that serious that I couldn't let that kind of stuff slide.

-TONIGHTS FINAL ACT...
... is usually reserved for the one-legged chick with the eye-patch who does something nasty with a dollar bill.  Well, even I'm not that bad.  I liked this stupid movie for its fun production values, campy but effective acting and it's likeably dumb story caveats.  The story does work if you allow the stupidity to pull it together.  If you can't look past these glaring, goofy conveniences in the story you'd better look elsewhere.  I got a kick out of it.  The DVD is pretty standard fare; decent quality picture and sound.  You get plenty for your money.

846129,4,6304282699,"The 80's may have been the decade I grew up in, but I'm far from nostalgic for its (often) mediocre movie offerings. I'm not a big fan
of film favorites like Sixteen Candles or Goonies. There's nothing wrong with these films; it's just a matter of taste.

Until I read the back of the DVD case, I hadn't heard anything about this film. Nothing. The plot seemed fairly standard, ""a group of
fraternity pledges head for the seedy side of the city in search of strippers and discover a sinister spot called The After Dark Club."" It was touted by Anchor Bay as a ""horror comedy."" At $4 how could I say no?

The parts that really impressed me were as follows. First, there was the demon-esque vampire makeup. I'm always a sucker (pun not intended.  I shouldn't have even drawn attention to it, really) for good character designs, even if the film itself is mediocre (EG: Return of the Living Dead 3). The vampires here look really ghoulish. I also enjoyed how it almost felt like a legitimate 80's teen flick due to the antics of Gedde Watanabe (aka the little asian dude) of Sixteen Candles.  There were a few laughs too, even if they're mostly that eye-rolling, oh-my-God-so-80's type of way. Sometimes I felt guilty for laughing.  Last of all, it co-stars Deedee Pfeiffer. Ever since I saw her in The Midnight Hour (at the age of six) I've had a huge crush on her.  She pretty much made the movie (for me).

Let's face it, this is no Lost Boys. But there is enough here for any true horror fan to enjoy. Or if 80's nostalgia is your thing, there's plenty of that too. Definitely worth a view.",1186963200,,1590,4.443298969072165
846205,4,6304282699,"Chris Makepeace and Robert Rusler star as two college guys who have to score a super-hot stripper to get into their preferred fraternity in the 1986 horror/comedy ""Vamp."" The pair induct a third member to their party by recruiting ""16 Candles'"" Gedde Watanabe, an obnoxious and lonely rich kid who can provide them with the transportation they need to get to a strip club and back with the night's entertainment. However, after arriving at their destination, things quickly go awry. When one of the boys is led into the backrooms of the strip club and doesn't return, his disappearance kicks off a wild and dangerous night for his companions and their new dancer friend played by Dedee Pfeiffer. As it turns out, the strip club and the very town itself is a haven for vampires, and the frighteningly seductive Grace Jones is the Egyptian ruler of them all!

""Vamp"" is a highly energized and entertaining 80's horror comedy from director Richard Wenk. Though not without its flaws (like the very idea of Grace Jones being the most desirable stripper in that club), the film delivers with classic 80's effects and humor and a small helping of some really gruesome stuff. The performances are great all around, including Sandy Baron as the sleazy emcee, and the only place you feel slightly cheated is at the climax. Yeah, ha, worst place to feel cheated I guess. It's just that the death of the head vamp is a wee bit anticlimactic. However, this is followed by a surprise ending that puts the film snugly into the ""so bad it's good"" category. Though, most of it actually IS good. It's sort of an interesting balance of ""good"" and ""so bad it's good."" In fact, you'd have to see it for yourself to know what I mean. The DVD is top notch, as the film is presented in a nice widescreen transfer and loaded with extras. In addition to trailers and TV spots, posters and promo stills, and a blooper and rehearsal reel, we even get a commentary with the director and three of the stars, plus the entire short film that earned Richard Wenk the directing job on Vamp, ""Dracula Bites the Big Apple."" As for that short, it has its strong and weak points but is well worth a watch. However, it certainly leaves you thinking that, between it and ""Love At First Bite,"" somebody was ripping off somebody! Anyway, overall, ""Vamp"" is a great bargain and will guarantee you a highly entertaining evening! And, if you enjoy ""Vamp,"" you've gotta check out ""Fright Night,"" ""Vampires,"" ""Bordello of Blood,"" and the ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" trilogy!",1185148800,3,2522,4.693002257336343

There they meet the strange owners, the sexy strippers and the seductive main star named Katrina (Grace Jones)who aren't what they appear to be as they are actually blood-thristy vampires in disguise, can they survive one hell of a night?

An outrageous and sexy horror comedy that has gained a cult following ever since it's release and is one of the most underrated vampire movies ever. Though it's not as awesome as ""Fright Night"", ""Lost Boys"" or ""Near Dark"" i still think this is a charming and sometimes funny movie that co-stars sexy DeeDee Pfiefer (Michelle's sister) as the main hero's girlfriend and Bill Drago (""The Hills Have Eyes 2006"") as an albino man, the make-up and gore effects are outstanding thanks to the wizardry of Greg Cannom (who did the make-up for Bram Stoker's Dracula) and the acting is fine. Grace Jones herself steals the show as the title character and is probably her best role since she played in ""Conan The Destroyer"".

The film is surprsingly stylish with stylish green and pinkish hues adding to a strange landscape. This film reminds me of Martin Scorcese's AFTER HOURS. Like AFTER HOURS this has a surreal world just around the corner from normality where oddballs lie in wait and strange events lead into other strange events.

846214,4,6304282699,"'Vamp' was one of those first R-rated movies I first caught as a teenager after midnight on Cinemax (before the schedule turned into soft-core porn). Thus, if you are under 21 years old, you've never heard of this flick.

Made in 1986, 'Vamp' reeks of the cheesy images one has come to recognize from movies during that decade.  Overabundance of neon lights in bars/strip clubs, needlessly flowing curtains from oversized open windows, wafer thin plot, obligatory nudity ... ah, such was the decade of decadence.

Aside from Grace Jones (whom you think was literally BORN for her title role), Vamp has actors whom you reccognize, but you can't place their names - but it doesn't matter.  If you're in your late 20s or early 30s, Vamp is a nice trip down memory lane.

846270,5,6304282699,"Second in a trio of ""toothy comedies"" which spawned the 80s vampire revival, Vamp was released a few months after Fright Night and preceded The Lost Boys by a year. Of the three, I actually liked Vamp the best. The unique look and feel, offbeat characterisations and solid acting of the film fleshes out and over shadows the admittedly silly premise.
Rather than using old horror (like Fright Night) or fairytales (Lost Boys) as its main influence, Wenk's influences were more the black comedy of Scorsese's After Hours and Landis' Into the Night -- this enabled him to populate the film with amusingly offbeat eccentrics. The leads studied coolness and wit also differed from the hysteria and paranoia of film characters that populated the ""Teen Horror Comedy"" subgenre of the 80s.
Then there is Grace Jones - 'nuff said.
Besides his eye for style, his choice of soundtrack was equally inspired, using old pop standards was another smart/ironic stylistic choice.
Besides the director and the cast, this is also the begining of SFX artist Greg Cannom's long association with movie vampires. He would move onto The Lost Boys and ultimately, Coppola's Dracula.
As for the Anchor Bay DVD,
Another job well done! The image transfer is impeccable, esp. for what is a low budget ""throaway"" fare. The sound is not state of the art but not distractingly so. But the best part of the dvd has to be one of the most entertaining commentary i have heard in a long time, not exactly the most imformative but Wenk and the cast was clearly having a ball, it was almost like watching Mystery Science Theatre 3000!

Then finally I got a DVD player and my very first DVD, Vamp! The DVD is SUPERB all around. The special features, the transfer, and the sound. The movie is just lovely. The actors are cute and funny and charming. Especially the late Sandy Baron, Dee Dee, Gedde, and Chris. The commentary track is hilarious. It's ALL good. It was also great to finally see it in widescreen for the first time (my eyes).

Last, but surely not least: Grace Jones... She is fabulous!!! Her seductive strip dance is to die for.... Grace Jones is a beautiful and wonderful Goddess! And maybe a bit scary, just a lil' bit (or always).
Seriously though, I assure you this movie will grow on you and you'll just adore it, if not... Grace Jones will lunge at you stiletto's first! BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!!! *HISSSSSSSSSS*

846272,4,6304282699,"I tend to rate a vampire film on what I call ""Bite Scenes"" (like the money-shot), a vampire film should have at least one good scene where the vampire feeds on a victim (unlike some American films such as Cold Hearts, where the vampire drags the victim out of site, & turns up later with blood-smeared mouth). Vamp has a great 'bite scene'. Grace Jones plays a very powerul, agressive female vampire who completely dominates her prey. For this one scene alone, I've given the film 4 stars.
Unfortunately, the rest of the film is appalling. There's too much of this that doesn't make sense. Why do the vampires sleep amongst drums of petrol? Chris Makepeace uses these to set the vampires alight. Obviously a good idea would have been for the vampires to settle down for the night in a more secure place.
Billy Drago has a small part as an albaino nutcase, but he's sort of a side-story who is inserted in this film for no real reason.
Too much of this film doesn't make sense.",1039219200,4,976,4.48876404494382
846273,4,6304282699,"this tongue in cheek movie about the undead operating a strip bar in a run down section of a city to lure drunks and other retrobates to their death is an original-if somewhat silly concept for a movie hence the  4 stars instead of 5).but despite this obvious flaw in the movie(i really think it was produced this way on purpose)it makes for a wonderfully funny(if not sometimes kind of gory) vampire movie. the lead vampire played by grace jones is always being hounded by her manager to move to las vegas but she is doing just fine where she is.
  this movie is full of stripping vampires,whiteheaded street freaks and little girl vampires who like to chomp on big persons necks.
  the humour is intentional,the acting is good and the the script is okay.this is another of many strange movies that i just can't help liking.this is another movie that i'm sure the critics didn't like-but the video buying public have embraced.i am so glad they put this out in dvd-we need to just keep pressuring the studios to keep putting out these older movies in dvd.

846274,3,6304282699,This movie is interesting as long as you aren't looking for anything TOO deep.  The premise is two college guys get mixed up with vampires who own the local bar.  One of them gets turned into a vampire while the other spends his time desperately trying to understand what's going on.  It's fun fluff and features singer Grace Jones as the head vampire.  The ending is a surprise but nothing that carries any special meaning or message.  I'd save this one for people who are diehard vampire fans . . . and it might be a little too tongue in cheek for some viewers.  It was nonetheless very different for the time when it was made.  Give it a chance . . . it might grow on you.,1028160000,2,675,4.2265625
846275,5,6304282699,"I will admit that this is not the best movie ever made, but it certainly is my favorite. Grace Jones always looks like she would rip your skin off with her teeth, bit by bit.
The first thing you notice is how surreal the background gets after dark. I love the humor in this movie. I think this movie should be rated as the best cult film ever. The lines are delivered with comic expertise. For anyone who loves vampire movies as much as I do, you will love this movie. Not a scary movie for the squeemish, but extremely entertaining. Once it gets dark, beware. Snow and his followers will get you, if the vampires in the club don't.
My favorite line in the movie (it was hard to choose) is the one that A. J. delivers when he says, ""formica, go figure"". If you see the movie, then you will understand the meaning of that line. Another great line was when the little rich friend asks one of the waitresses what time she gets off. She states in a very husky voice, ""3:30"". He then says, ""can I watch?""
Lots of tongue in cheek, and even a bit of romance towards the end. This is a fun movie for people who don't take vampires seriously.",1026432000,10,1133,4.225806451612903

The cast is perfect for the film and the decision to let Grace Jones say NOTHING is the best thing to happen to the film. If that had happened I think I would have to give this thing 3 or 4 stars. Anyway, in a much happier and fun way than Eraserhead, this film evokes a feeling of ""Where in the hell does a place like this exist?"" It's like a dark corner of the Twilight Zone somewhere. In fact the whole movie is similar, in effect, to a Twilight Zone episode, but with more comedy. Very Nice looking female Vampires...Just makes you want to say...BITE ME!

846349,5,6304282699,"This is an example of a GREAT job by Anchor Bay in packaging a cult film, and loading it with extras as well as a very good transfer.  The blooper reel offers some deleted scenes, the rehearsal footage is hilarious (Grace Jones attacking the director!), and the commentary on the DVD is funny and engaging.
The movie itself is an 80s horror-comedy modeled almost slavishly on AFTER HOURS. The premise is two college buddies end up trying to find a stripper for a frat party, but somehow end up in a weird alternate reality where vampires prey on the homeless and hapless.  Grace Jones has no lines as the titular role and first-billed and maybe 8 minutes screen-time total!  But what a great vampire, and she does make her scenes pop off the screen without saying a word.  DeeDee Pfiefer (yes, sister of Michelle) plays Amaretto (""not my real name"") with a wide eyed glee that counters perfectly the darkness around her.  And Chris Makepeace and Robert Rusler play chums caught in the TWILIGHT ZONE that is the world of VAMP.  Add in a comedic turn by Geddy Watanabe (of 16 CANDLES FAME - Long Duck Dong), and you've got a game cast to do a dark comedy!

With the capable talent of Greg Cannon, Oscar Winner makeup genius, a writhing Grace Jones (A View to A Kill) becomes living artwork and a blood-chilling monster. Character actor Billy Drago (True Blood) adds to the movie's artistic flair by playing a psychotic, white-haired albino gang leader with vengence on his mind. Many sets are bathed in primary-colored lighting. The supporting actors' costumes are designed to emphasize the atmosphere of this campy vampire movie. And the clever lack of dialog for Grace Jones adds to her character's mystique. This movie is fun and at the same time very stylish. Definitely worth a look.",1000339200,2,744,5.208333333333333

846352,3,6304282699,"Vamp (1986) is a movie that was overlooked by many critics. It's obvious that this is indeed a low buget film with its less than extravagent sets but at the same time the film manages to evoke an eerie, atmospheric feel to it that remains consistent throughout. Although billed as a comic-horror, there are very few laughs and you only really sense it's meant to be with the rather at times, caricture performances. However on saying that the cast all satisfy amicably with Chris Makepeace and Sandy Barron being the main players, although Grace Jones gets top billing (even though she doesn't say a single word and parodies erractically throughout the film giving mean, menacing looks). The film holds it's fair share of shocks and jumpy moments amongst the hair raising adventures making this an overly good film. On saying that the film can come across as a painfully obvious product of the 1980's with it's scenery (although its green light is surprisingly effective) and it's performances, but the film is still watchable and entertaining.

846354,5,6304282699,"Visit the After Dark Club... and you won't want to leave. Grace Jones heads up the cast as an over-the-top vampire (though thankfully she never has to speak!).
This movie is about as tongue in cheek as you can get (have you ever seen a vampire staked through the heart using a six inch stiletto?) and thankfully never takes itself too seriously.
Even so, it manages to create it's own style of atmosphere that has you gripped from beginning to end with an attitude much akin to that of Big Trouble in Little China. The set design, though never big budget really makes you feel you are in the underworld, with some excellent lighting effects. And the cast work well together (Gede Watanabe as Duncan is hilarious).
In short, this is a cult classic that you will love if you enjoy 80's movies such as Big Trouble in Little China. Order it now and get yourself a little piece of cult 80's movie viewing.",991267200,9,900,4.4939024390243905

7868171,4,6304282699,"Ive noted before that in the 80s there was a glut of horror films being made. It was like theyd suddenly become acceptable by then, the children hidden away and referred to only on special occasions. The rise of the horror movie at this time has led to the genre becoming what it is today, more mainstream than since the days of the classic Universal horror films.

The only problem back then was that not all of those films were great. Some were but most qualified as mediocre. Then there were movies like VAMP that did well enough but dropped into the cult status rather than box office mega hit.

The story follows two young pledges to a fraternity, Keith (Chris Makepeace) and AK (Robert Rusler). Their final task to achieve membership is to provide special entertainment for the frats big bash. Of course AJ, the easy going slick talker of the two, decides that the best option is to head to the big city and pick up a few strippers to bring back. With rich pledge Duncan in tow (Gedde Watanabe) they're off and running.

The problems begin when the trio find a local strip joint without realizing that all of the girls dancing there are actually vampires. When the vampire queen Katrina (Grace Jones) puts AJ under her spell, he ends up becoming one of the vampires as well. With the help of a waitress named Amaretto (Deedee Pfeiffer) Keith tries to escape along with Duncan. But thing, as they say, don't go according to plans.

The movie was a fun film, offering just the right touch of humor to the horror to make a film unlike any other. This nice blend offered some moments that would make the least regular horror fan jump while the die-hards chuckled at their shock. The laughs were not belly laughs but enough to make you smile and have a good time watching.

Makepeace at the time was coming off of earlier hits like MEATBALLS and MY BODYGUARD as a child and trying to shoot for more mature roles. Hitting a strip club was a change of pace in seeing him. Rusler had already hit the horror market as a cast member in NIGHTMATER OF ELM STREET 2. And Jones we making her mark on movies at the time, something she never really pursued strongly after just a few films.

All in all the movie offered great entertainment which is what they were shooting for. Fans discovered it on cable and video and it was more popular after its initial release than during. Since then fans have been hoping for more and now they have it since Arrow Video has released it with a special version.
Start with the fact that this is a new digital transfer. Included in the extras are the documentary ONE OF THESE NIGHTS: THE MAKING OF VAMP, behind the scenes rehearsals, a blooper reel, an image gallery, DRACULA BITES THE BIG APPLE a celebrated short film from director Richard Wenk and a reversible sleeve featuring newly commissioned artwork by Twins of Evil.

Arrow comes through once again with a solid take on a movie most would find unworthy of special attention. As always it shows why they are one of the best companies around when it comes to material like this.",1505001600,,3062,4.516245487364621

7868174,5,6304282699,"The last time i saw this film was back on VHS tape so i only remember little bits of the film
so i decided to buy this new 2016 reissue by Arrowfilms for a few reasons
1st to check out the film again, 2nd to check the 1080p HD transfer & also the new retrospective Doco Arrow has added to this blu-ray
and i have no regrets buying this new blu-ray just to check it out infact it's been worth the cash
after watching the film well the Vampire characters steal the whole film for sure
especially Grace Jones as Katrina Head vampire & also Billy Drago as Snow
the other Vampire strippers are just for show in my opinion
the Vampire make up looks incredible looks scary as Hell by make up effects artist Greg Cannom
i believe when VAMP was released in Cinemas, Greg did the vampire make up on THE LOST BOYS
Dee Dee Pfeiffer's character is extremely annoying just talks Garbage alot thru the whole film
but Robert rusler & Chris makepeace did Great performances
Arrowfilms 1:85:1 HD transfer was done by Lakeshore ent' which does look amazing quality, No Grain no Dirt
the sound quality is 1.0 mono sound which sounded Good but not excellent a 5.1 mix would've been much better
EXTRAS, Arrow have added a retrospective Documentary for this new 2016 blu-ray reissue
new interviews with Writer/Director Richard wenk, D.O.P Elliot Davis & actors Robert rusler, Dee dee Pfeiffer, Gedde watanabe & Billy Drago
and that's it, tragically no interview with Grace Jones, no interview with make up effects man Greg cannom either
plus the old extras from the old Anchor bay dvd are on this blu-ray aswell
the new artwork of this blu-ray sucks i don't like it so i switched around the sleeve for the 1986 Theatrical poster artwork
which is the same artwork as the old VHS tape which is much better cover to me
there's also a booklet included Arrowfilms include a booklet with all their blu-ray reissues
this 2016 blu-ray is just 1 Disc blu-ray, not a Blu-ray/dvd combo
5 stars for this new blu-ray reissue worth buying for sure",1484784000,,2010,4.55524861878453
