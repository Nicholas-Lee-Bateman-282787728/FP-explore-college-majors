8657685,5,B00KD0OUTY,"This homespun film, probably filmed entirely on a mobile device, is filled with demonstrations of God's love and power. It features several Spirit-led encounters (Tom doesn't randomly approach people) and can change the atmosphere in your home just by playing on your TV. Tom and his wife are examples of what everyone wants to be--and can be--when allowing the Spirit to guide them.",1406505600,,383,5.095238095238095
8657686,5,B00KD0OUTY,"Tom and Ahava are an awesome couple doing the work of the Lord. They have such a great love for people and are examples of how to walkout like Jesus. I have learned so much from them and little by little I too am following their example and praying for people. I love supporting their ministry as it is real and I gain so much knowledge they freely share.
  I have to say my favorite testimony/ healing is from the last couple in this video, so I recommend you purchase their video to see it and be blessed by it. Please make another video soon brother Tom. Peace",1404259200,,563,4.203703703703703
8657687,4,B00KD0OUTY,"Great film, very exciting to see Tom in in action and God touching people. Missed a star for its home-made feel, which is understandable, being filmed mostly on a phone (I believe). However, the content is better than any billion-dollar-budget film, there's no substitute for ""raw"" real life. Overall a good buy, I look forward to sharing it with my friends.",1404172800,,358,4.885245901639344
8657688,5,B00KD0OUTY,"Fantastic!!!! The great power of God,great to see and very inspiring,thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and would definitely recommend to all",1403913600,,134,5.75
8657689,5,B00KD0OUTY,Been following Tom for a couple of years now and am amazed by his street ministry that brings healing and salvation to so many.,1403308800,,127,4.333333333333333
8657690,5,B00KD0OUTY,"I have been watching Tom for some time now on YouTube, and I am ALWAYS motivated, inspired, and rejuvenated (and jealous) to see such Love, Power, and Joy (Tom is the Apostle of Joy!) of Jesus Christ demonstrated on the street. I reassure you- this is what you want to see if you are interested in bringing Divine Healing and Deliverance...
Also, at the beginning of this movie, we see the gospel being shared leading to a Salvation prayer- which, is what it is all about... (well, that, and kicking the devil in the shins)- an awesome Divine Encounter- really a piece of Holy Ghost beauty. Imagine if this was shared at your church, or home group... every one of you would be motivated to reach someone who needs to hear YOU tell them, ""Jesus Christ came for YOU, yes, YOU."" When Tom says, ""God loves you."" - it goes straight to the heart. He certainly is a good steward of his Anointing (Healing AND Teaching), and he certainly is a model for all of us.
The Divine Street Healings with Tom and Ahava's style of delivery are all- MIRACULOUS! All praise Jesus Christ. You WILL be blessed in the watching, amen. (A note to the movie's ""prayees""- my Love goes out to all of you- may God bless you all more and more!)",1400544000,5,1214,4.424107142857143
8657691,5,B00KD0OUTY,"Tom has been an ""online mentor"" to me and really helped me to learn about this style of ministry by demonstrating it on Youtube.  I've personally met Tom and had opportunity to see him in action.  I fully recommend anything he puts out and would encourage you to not only watch this DVD, but also go DO the gospel as well.

Because of Tom's videos and ministry, I have been encouraged to step out in faith myself and have seen results in Jesus' name!  It's all for the glory of Jesus and Tom is making disciples just like we're commanded to in scripture.

Will update AFTER I actually view the movie.  God bless you!  ""Ain't that CRAZY??""",1400198400,8,638,4.401709401709402
