1661596,5,B00005TNES,I ordered this for my daughter who teaches Psychology and Sociology to high school students. She was pleased to receive it.,1411344000,,123,4.904761904761905
1661597,5,B00005TNES,My high school students really like this video.  It expands their understanding of the brain and how that relates to our senses  and personality.,1398816000,,145,5.0
1661598,5,B00005TNES,This is a pretty cool awesome amazing incredible documentary. Goes over lots of curiosities with the mind. I'm happy if i learned something and I certainly learned a lot!,1397088000,,170,4.896551724137931
1661599,5,B00005TNES,Many good examples I can use in psychology class. I love finding good examples that help students understand the material better,1390435200,,128,5.142857142857143
1661600,5,B00005TNES,"So, of course it is good. Ramachandran is an important researcher, and this presentation is quite useful in the classroom as well as for general viewing. If you like the inside look of a neuroscience researcher, this is excellent.",1390262400,,230,4.923076923076923
1661601,5,B00005TNES,"Have not opened the DVD yet, but originally saw parts of the show on PBS and had to watch the whole thing. Love learning about this topic personally and wanted to own it. DVD arrived intact and on time, and I like the content, so 5 stars it is.",1387238400,,244,4.0
1661602,5,B00005TNES,very interesting and well produced.  Explains some difficult psychological problems in a way that even high school kids can understand.,1380844800,,135,5.75
1661603,5,B00005TNES,"The doctor in the film shows the way the sections of the brain are divided into different compartments. These sections, if impacted either psychologically or physically. can cause illusions that can either help or hinder an individual. This DVD helps understand why and how people see the world differently. It provides an understanding that will lead the viewer to embrace peoples' ideas instead of quickly judging them. Keeping an open mind is the key to understanding this film.",1377993600,,481,5.17948717948718
1661604,5,B00005TNES,"This DVD I get it for a very special friend.
She was very happy that I get it for her.",1373328000,,86,3.35
1661615,5,B00005TNES,"This was a very good video, and I particularly thought the phantom limb information was helpful.  This is a concept that students have a difficult time understanding.",1370476800,,166,5.148148148148148
1661616,5,B00005TNES,"Dr. V.S. Ramachandran presents many cases of injuries which affect the human brain. For example: Phantom Limb Syndrome, Blind Sight, Injuries which can cause signals to go to our brain stem, which is our lizard brain (this seemed to be a problem with some former government officials who were known in the US as neocons), Visual Neglect, Oedipus Complex, Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Grand Mal Seizures which could cause a person to think they see God. The finding that there may be a religious center in our brains, if true, could be a positive benefit for a society, but negative if we see the beliefs of others as a threat to us. For example, we see in the news on a regular basis the ongoing war between Israelis and Palestinians, whose gene pools are almost identical, but are separated by religion.",1359158400,,799,4.714285714285714
1661617,3,B00005TNES,I played this in my undergraduate Physiological Psychology class.  It brought to life many of the topics we were covering in class that week.  The level of detail was good.  The students found the video helpful for understanding topics such as blind sight.  I was disappointed in the production value.,1358553600,,301,4.96
1661618,5,B00005TNES,"Neurobiologist Vilayanur Ramachandran tells of some of his most fascinating case studies, and what he has learned from them. His focus is on technological methods to study what was previously (even quite recently) interpreted as merely behavioral or ""crazy."" These are patients with brain damage or, as in the first segment, amputations and the phantom limb syndrome.

The last case study was the most intriguing. A young man with severe epilepsy who interprets his experiences as religious. The research into exactly what is going on in his brain during a seizure raises marvelous questions about the nature of religious experience.

But the study is as significant for what it avoids saying as what it says. Much of what the young epileptic describes is quite familiar to me as LSD experiences. But no mention of that connection is made, possibly because LSD is illegal, even for research. I have long suspected, however, that there was a connection with epilepsy, especially since having close friends who have seizures. And since epilepsy is a disorder which has been known from ancient times, and often interpreted as ""the hand of God"" in some form, we have to ask those hard questions.

I like Dr. Ramachandran very much, and Like NOVA for having produced this documentary. Makes me want to go back and look for more NOVA documentaries that I have not yet seen.",1336694400,,1367,4.960698689956332
1661619,3,B00005TNES,"I had a TBI and almost died. So I started rehab with a speech therapist (that's a thinking therapist) then with math fact pamphlets for 3-8 year olds. My new hobby is brain books & videos. This was just average, I actually forget a lot of it.",1334361600,,242,4.170212765957447
1661620,4,B00005TNES,"Interesting look at the brain and some of the unusual disorders which can occur in it. You can't help but to be drawn in by some of the first-hand stories of reinforced non-recognition of the familiar (""everything here has been replaced by an exact duplicate""), phantom pain from amputated limbs and blind eyes that see. The discussion by Dr. Ramachandran of these cases is absorbing and the computer animation showing what is going on in the brain is very helpful. Well worth watching!",1320364800,,486,4.867469879518072
1661621,5,B00005TNES,I use this DVD as an intro to brain disorders in my high school anatomy and physiology course. It really drives home the idea that we learn more and more about the brain every day from patients who have suffered brain injuries. Interesting and the perfect length for viewing and discussion. Highly recommended.,1296518400,,310,4.867924528301887
1661622,3,B00005TNES,This wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  However it's still worth watching.  The production lives up to the usual PBS standards of professionalism.  It gives some interesting examples of abnormnal psychology.  It also gives some good insight to possible causes.  However you're not going to learn much about the typical human mind from this DVD.,1294444800,,347,5.236363636363636
1661623,5,B00005TNES,"This doctor will take you to an insight into the brain like you have never thought before. He is the quintessential, cutting edge researcher into the brain,his work is scholarly and original.",1265587200,,191,5.0
1661624,4,B00005TNES,"This DVD opens up your mind to try to understand another's mind. You are helped to see the world as others perceive it and some of the aberrations that can occur. The brain is such a complex organ that the more you learn about it, the less you seem to understand it.",1252713600,,266,4.134615384615385
1661633,4,B00005TNES,"I am amazed how the brain functions are configured to work the way they do. Also, the DVD gives us a clear view of this powerful organ which coordinates the entire body interactions. Moreover, I cannot understand how the big-bang theory, or evolution could attribute the complex design of the brain to random selection, evolution, adaptation or similar views.",1247184000,,359,5.101694915254237
1661634,2,B00005TNES,"Watched this some weeks ago and really can't remember it other than to say it was not what I was looking for.  Thought it would give more info about how the mind works, diseases of the mind, basic anatomy and physiology but seems that it only focused on a few stories of people with mind issues.  More of a bio on those few featured rather than an overview of the mind itself.  Returned this one immediately and again got great service/full refund from Amazon.com, thanks!",1238025600,,472,4.529411764705882
1661635,5,B00005TNES,"Received product in excellent condition and in a timely manner.  This product gave interesting observations and insight into what our brains perceive over matter.  Moreover, some interesting insight into areas of our thought perceptions that may or may not be ""REAL"" or tangible, but are mentally REAL.  Parts of the video deal with phantom pain, how real this pain is to those experiencing it, and ways to deal with or aleviate the brains memory path to body parts that no longer exist.",1235779200,,487,4.914634146341464
1661636,4,B00005TNES,This film was very informative and intriguing. The research is thorough and easy to follow.,1235433600,,91,5.133333333333334
1661637,5,B00005TNES,"V.S. Ramachandran is just that.
I found this special to be utterly fascinating. I must admit that I was under the impression that the human brain was more mysterious than it seems to be. There are still great mysteries there but I obviously haven't kept up with our advancements.
V.S. is charming and brilliant. He understands how to comunicate grand ideas to the common man/woman.
This is  fantastic time to be alive. The scientific advances in our time are simply astounding.",1232236800,,477,4.888888888888889
1661638,5,B00005TNES,"Dr. Ramachandran is not only a great researcher in the active field of brain science, but is actually helping people.  This is an excellent feature which illustrates several real life examples of helping people in dire need of medical assistance while doing good research and solid science. Dr. Ramachandran is as brilliant an educator and public speaker as he is a researcher. This was a totally engrossing demonstration of ongoing research applied to people and their problems. Another very interesting DVD featuring Dr. Ramachandran, as well as other important brain researchers is ""Consciousness"", also available from Amazon.",1219449600,,629,5.484536082474227
1661639,5,B00005TNES,"if you are the least bit curious on how the mind works and the infinite mysteries that it holds then this DVD is for you.  Some of the fascinating things that scientists, psychologists and physcians have discovered about the inner workings of the brain is unfortunately the result of brain injured patients. These people are the subjects of this DVD. It concerns their weird symptomalogies after surviving a truamatic, mechanical head injury, all of them real interesting subject matters but ofcourse the star of the show is the charismatic and engaging, Dr Ramachandran.  He's obviously very smart and the top of his field, Nueroscience but he also has the enthusiasm of a keen five year old boy.  His best asset is his charm and the rare ability to transform his own fascination about the brain into an interesting and compelling subject for the average, lay viewer. The camera loves him and he knows how to engage the camera.  He would make a personable science TV host.  The subject matter is interesting in itself for people in the medical field but Ramachandran makes it interesting for everyone.  Highly recommended, it can be purchased by itself or as a set of three DVD's.  But I thought it fair to review each DVD individually.",1214870400,,1237,4.834123222748815
1661640,5,B00005TNES,Item arrived as scheduled.  Information put into perspective and shed more light on mind and the brain according to neuroscience.  Try brushing your teeth with your other hand and see what happens.,1208908800,,197,5.125
1661641,4,B00005TNES,"A very interesting look at the human brain.  Gives you some interesting theories on how the brain re-routes itself to make good on missing limbs and brain damage due to car accidents.  Insightful, but semi-repetitive.  Worth seeing though!",1207440000,,239,5.2368421052631575
1661642,5,B00005TNES,"I highly recommend this video. The brilliant Doctor clearly and simply explains some of the most perplexing neurological problems that have plagued mankind for decades and in the case of phantom pain,across centuries. The explanations offered are realistic and understandable by both the novice student and seasoned professional. This presentation should be mandatory viewing in all Introductory and Neuropsychology classes.",1207353600,,424,6.083333333333333
1661643,5,B00005TNES,Scientific and Medical findings on our Brain and mental function are accumulating fast. This video gives good update.,1202860800,,117,5.555555555555555
1661644,5,B00005TNES,Very very cool.  Sort of like sherlock holmes on the brain.  Interesting and easy to watch.  Its amazing.,1198454400,,105,4.722222222222222
1661645,5,B00005TNES,"In ""Secrets of the Mind"" we gain insights through various tragedies that have affected others, thanks to the logic and insights of Professor Ramachandran regarding what he calls the most complex organized matter in the universe.

The DVD begins with ""phantom limb syndrome"" - pain and sensation in missing body areas.  Ramachandran's reasoning, confirmed through a CAT-scan, is that the brain has a map of various body areas, and that eg. the right arm and right face areas of the brain are adjacent.  Thus, missing body areas can lead to interference by those associated brain areas trying to cope with stimulus deprivation - eg. ""cross-wiring.""

However, we are still left with the problem of treating pain in a body-part that no longer exists.  Dr. Ramachandran found that placing the remaining opposite body part (eg. hand) into a mirror-box fools the mind into receiving feedback from the missing part and no longer sending ever-increasing (and unmet) signals that cause the pain.

Visual activities take up almost half the human brain.  Dr. Ramachandran is confronted with an individual who can ""see"" (detect) movement but not recognize what the object is.  His explanation is that there are two pathways from the eye in humans:  one to the visual cortex that recognizes the object, and other to the brain stem that simply senses movement.  Thus, when the visual cortex link is severed, one would only be able to recognize movement of a fly, but not the fly itself - perhaps the way a lizard views the world.  Similarly, he says to driving - most of the time it is done without consciousness while the conscious brain is taken up in talking of other thinking.

Dr. Ramachandran believes that there are some 30 areas in the brain concerned with seeing - separate areas for color, movement, shape, distance and depth perception, etc.  Interference/damage to any one of these areas can lead to oddities - eg. an individual believing his parents are impostors when the emotional response area is cut.

Finally, viewers are told that some people with temporal seizures have intense religious or emotional experiences, possibly believing they are a prophet or even God, or sensing an intense emotional reaction to everything - even a grain of sand.",1195171200,,2248,4.991957104557641
1661646,5,B00005TNES,"As a high school IB Biology teacher I showed this video as part of a unit on the brain. Students were most taken with Case #1: Phanton Limb. I followed the case with two hands on exercises (from the teaching materials) that allow students to experience phantom sensations. I ended the lesson with a reading called ""The Man Who Fell Out of Bed"" from an Oliver Sachs book, followed by the online actvitiy ""Probe the Brain"" (PBS) which simulates the Penfield sensory motor cortex findings. A very stimulationg little lesson!",1181692800,,521,4.8
1661647,5,B00005TNES,"Intriqued by questions of consciousness and the puzzle of mind boggling brain injuries?

This DVD stimulates an awarwness that - was not there before?

Is seeing believing?

 Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's unique knowledge of neuroscience and his intuitive way to solve the seemingly impossible, is worth the price alone.",1172275200,,314,5.479166666666667
1661648,5,B00005TNES,"First off, they have mixed information on two very different films.  The release date, ""storyline"" information and ""theatrical release"" information are totally wrong. Hopefully, they will have corrected the actor/director information within several days--Stacy Keach has nothing to do with this particular film. The ""Editorial Reviews"" section is correct. This particular video was originally shown in 2001 on PBS and is sort of a brief synopsis, with video examples, of a book by V.S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee about some extremely interesting neuropsychological disorders. The book is called ""Phantoms in the Brain"" (available through Amazon where I have bought at least 2 copies--I keep giving them away to people) Before you say ""Whoa, clearly not for me,"" stop. This is an utterly fascinating documentary where Dr. Ramachandran (neurologist and research Ph. D. at UCSD) illustrates some of the interesting ways that the brain and mind work viewed through the lens of these individual case studies. When I show the video to my classes, as I have for the last 5 years, it purely drops their jaws. This film is not only for those interested in psychology or neuroscience, but anyone who is curious about what goes on in human beings under the hood, so to speak. Further, as a speaker and presenter Dr. Ramachandran is both highly personable and accessible and who also doesn't condescend to either his audience or his patients. If you like science and are curious about the brain, you will like this. I only wish PBS and NOVA would issue a DVD version as well. I'm here because a friend wants to borrow my copy and I won't let it out of my hands without another copy.",1143072000,,1677,4.967971530249111
1661649,5,B00005TNES,"I am a psychology teacher and this video is great of school I think it's one of the best videos I show in my classes all day. I hope all my students go on-line and vote for this review and support it because they like the video so much. Also, the description of the video pretty much lays out what's in the video, so I just wanted to mention how interesting and compelling it is. Also, it's not a boring video for school, it's an interesting video and fun to watch. Enjoy.",1134864000,,472,4.141304347826087
