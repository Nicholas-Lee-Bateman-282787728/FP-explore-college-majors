5972431,5,B00F9JP39A,"This is fitness dvd is like nothing else out there.  It is well thought out, very original, beautifully shot, and accessable to everyone without the intimidation factor that is in so many work-out dvds currently in the marketplace.  This dvd actually allows you to grow with it since you can follow 3 different women, doing 3 different levels of difficulty in all of the routines.  Also, there are no women featured in this dvd who aren't real, everyday women...there are no neckless men who clearly use steriods that you find in fitness dvds all the time and there are no skinny runway models who clearly have eating disorders.  This is a dvd without impossible expectations and there are no screaming meanies like Jillian Micheals or her wannabes to make you feel discouraged or bad about yourself.  This is also a dvd where the celebrity does not try and pretend she is all of a sudden a fitness expert, nutritionist or personal trainer.  Lisa was smart and honest about her choice to let the actual fitness expert (Janice Clark) be the fitness expert and lead the routines.  Lisa is right upfront in the routines but she is there as any other everyday women and she represents you, the person watching the dvd at home.  Lisa's wit, charm and personality really shine throughout the entire program and will have you laughing, having a great time, reminiscing about Blair Warner and The Facts of Life (probably singing the theme song) and doing something good for yourself all at the same time.  There are bonus features on this dvd too and they are amazing personal trainer tips that are extremely helpful....these aren't gym tips, they are everyday life tips.  You won't be disappointted or let down.....you will probably only be asking for Lisa to do another one or ten of these.  Great job Lisa Whelchel  Very Impressive!!",1385769600,112,1828,4.805111821086262

5972445,4,B00F9JP39A,I am of retirement age + and looked for a workout CD to match my abilities.  This tape offers 3 levels of difficulty.  I was able to achieve all but one of the moves (knee replacement) in the warm up and daily routines.  I am very satisfied with this offering.,1423872000,,260,4.16
5972446,4,B00F9JP39A,"To me, it seems like it is harder to find moderate exercise DVDs these days. There are some exceptions, like walking workouts and some of the dance workouts. But, it seems like a large percentage of workouts these days are ""extreme"", ""ultimate"", and/or ""killer"". These workouts appeal to many people, but there are others who want a moderate workout that won't kill them and that will help them just be healthy and fit.

This workout fits that niche and is targeted at beginner to low intermediate exercisers. In her introduction Lisa Whelchel, former star from The Facts of Life, stresses that this DVD is for the woman who doesn't necessarily like exercise, but who wants what it can do for her or who doesn't have a lot of time, but who wants exercise that can be done, so that she can move on with the rest of life. And she, Lisa, puts herself in that group.

This DVD offers two segments that can be done separately or together. These segments are 15 minutes segment and 20 minutes. The DVD menu gives options to do them together or one at a time, with or without the warm up and cool down. I did them together for a pretty good workout that lasts a little over 40 minutes.

The workout is comprised of strength moves, interspersed with bursts of cardio. The instructor tends to start with a simple move and then morph it into a compound move. The pace throughout the workout is fairly slow and deliberate and I had no problem with keeping up with what was happening (picking up dumbbells or putting them down). There are also a number of balance challenges that can be done as well. The cueing was generally well done and the instructor does mirror cue.

There are three exercisers backing up the instructor and they do beginner, intermediate, and advanced modification levels. Lisa does the intermediate level. The thing I liked about them is that they all looked like ""real"" women rather than fitness models. Lisa says that they are friends of hers and I wondered if they really are. She and the lead instructor apparently are friends. Lisa is miked along with the instructor and she talks some. She makes some comments, which some will find inane, and she asks some obviously planted questions, like ""Will using weights make my muscles really big?"" (or something like that). I liked her in this workout, but then I was probably flashing back to when I loved watching Facts of Life (yes, I'm THAT old).

I have bad knees and a bad back and bad hands. I modified separately from all the exercisers once in awhile, but I generally followed one of the three. It worked fine for me. There are a number of squats and lunges and if you try to avoid these, this wouldn't be the workout for you.

The setting looks like a living room in the background. They stand in front of the furniture on the set. I don't remember any music and I assume I would have noticed if there wasn't any, so it must not have been memorable at all. This workout does not require much room.

I think that this DVD is very doable for beginners. It is also versatile enough to appeal to somewhere into the intermediate range of exercisers because of the different levels they offer of the moves. I do NOT think that this workout is for high intermediate or advanced exercisers unless they are looking for an easy workout. It does move at a moderate pace. I found it to be a refreshing change from the general trend of exercise DVDs these days, but some will find it boring.

Instructor Comments:
The instructor was good, especially given it was her first video workout. She mirror cued and gave good pointers and seemed to stick with her plan.",1423699200,3,3618,4.546850998463902

5972451,3,B00F9JP39A,"I am glad I didn't buy this, I would have been very disappointed. I saw an interview with Lisa and they were talking about this workout. Knowing her tv history and reputation, I was eager to give it a chance. There are 2 basic workouts and a few options to make it seem like more. Workout 1, Workout 2, can be done with or without the warm up and cool down, then the option to do both workouts with warm up and cool down included.
These workouts are extremely basic to the point they were boring for me. If I had to choose, I like workout 2 better because of the exercises included like the plank progressions. The clam is one I've done in physical therapy so I was pleased to see that. In my humble opinion, I feel the exercises weren't done enough reps or held long enough for true effectiveness. I wish there was a music only option, not that there was noticeable music, but hearing Lisa's comments grated on my nerves! I couldn't imagine having to hear that each time. The comments sounded more scripted than anything. The progression could've been set up better. There's a lot of getting up and down that some may have issues with.
This can be a great video for those needing not strenuous, basic exercise, without spending a lot of time, to say that you've done something. As for me, I'm returning it to the library.",1408752000,,1322,4.4

5972483,4,B00F9JP39A,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.

This DVD features actress Lisa Whelchel, best-known from her days of playing rich girl Blair Warner on the 80s sitcom ""The Facts of Life.""  Rather than lead the workouts herself, she is just another ""everyday"" woman performing the exercises, whereas one of her ""oldest and dearest friends,"" Janice Clark, a personal fitness trainer and ""corrective exercise specialist,"" is the featured instructor.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction -- Workout Options -- Personal Training Tips -- Biographies -- Also from Acacia -- Credits.  ""Training Tips"" opens a submenu of tutorials featuring Whelchel and Clark one-on-one; the selections here are Play All (17 min.) -- Body Alignment (7 min.) -- Core (5 min.) -- Breathing (5 min.).

Workout Options also brings up its own submenu as follows:

PLAY ALL (44 min.)
(Warm-Up plus Workout 1 plus Workout 2 plus Cool-Down)

WORKOUT 1 (15 min.)
with Warm-Up and Cool-Down (24 min.)

WORKOUT 2 (20 min.)
with Warm-Up and Cool-Down (29 min.)

For each routine, Clark instructs live with Whelchel and two other exercisers, Jackie and Loree, in the background.  The exercises are performed at three levels:  Jackie does the ""foundation"" move, Welchel demonstrates the ""next step,"" and Loree offers the ""challenge"" version.  Equipment needed for this workout includes two sets of dumbbells (for the ""next step"" level and above), an optional chair for balance, and a mat for the floorwork.  I have described each of the segments in greater detail below.

WARM-UP (5.5 min.)
For this sequence, Clark begins standing with the hands on the thighs for belly breathing.  She then performs flowing movements such as arm swings and moves into a nice series of dynamic stretches, including a standing hip flexor/hip stretch.  She concludes with a stretch for the shoulders.

WORKOUT 1 (15 min.)
Clark states that it is important to activate the core to begin, so she moves to the floor for several holds of elbow plank.  The group stays on the floor but comes to their backs for a few sets of bridge work.  Returning to standing, there is a repeater knee series performed on either side.  The lighter weights (2-4 lbs.) are used for a squat with a rhomboid pinch, a standing cobra, and then a combination that starts as a bicep curl, moves into an overhead press, and eventually combines the two moves, adding a squat.  (Clark called this a ""cardio"" sequence, but it didn't quite raise the heart rate to aerobic levels.)  Moving on to the heavier weights (5-10 lbs.), Clark returns to the floor for a chest press, then comes back to standing for a bent-over row, repeating this series.  She concludes the first workout with a short set of squat jumps, which did briefly raise the heart rate.

WORKOUT 2 (20 min.)
Clark starts the second workout with side plank, performing clams between sides.  Moving to all-fours, she continues to work the core with a set of balance holds.  Then the group comes to standing for a front/side lunge series followed by a side-to-side skater step.  Picking up the weights, Clark cues deadlifts, adding rotational punches to the corners between sets.  The next sequence involves raising the weights to the side in a ""T"" and to the front in a ""V,"" and then combining these arm movements with a front and side lunge, respectively.  Putting the weights down and grabbing the chair, Clark demonstrates leg lifts and leg extensions to the side.  She picks the weights back up for punches front but puts them down again to do side kicks.  She finishes the workout with punches, including uppercuts and alternating punch/rows with single knees.

COOL-DOWN (3 min.)
Clark begins with a hip flexor stretch, offering the option of performing this standing or kneeling.  Next is a standing side stretch which also targets the IT band, and Clark finishes with a standing neck stretch.  Although few in number, the stretches are held for a nice amount of time.

Overall, this DVD provides some nice options for its intended audience of ""everyday"" women--that is, women who are short on time, who may have some physical limitations, and who have not been exercising regularly to date.  Being able to choose one of three workouts (e.g., 1, 2, or both together) is a nice option, as is the choice to follow different levels of intensity.

Unfortunately, there are a few negatives about this DVD.  Having the warm-up and cool-down chaptered separately is not really ideal for beginning exercisers, who might be inclined to skip these important segments.  Also, although I thought that Clark did a good job with her instruction, I was less impressed with her sequencing of the exercises, particularly the frequent moving down to the floor and back up again (especially challenging for those who are overweight, those with blood pressure issues, etc.).  However, the main liability of this DVD was probably Whelchel herself.  During the routines, she frequently chimes in with goofy comments (e.g., ""reaching for the cookies!"") which I found to be a distraction rather than any benefit.

In summary, this DVD is likely to hold the most appeal for those wanting to gently ease into an exercise routine; if you are a fan of Lisa Whelchel, so much the better.",1390694400,21,5387,4.93118756936737
5972484,2,B00F9JP39A,"This DVD really only has two workouts, but each one can be played with or without the warm-up/cool-down, so that makes it seem like there are more options.  I didn't like the first workout (too much emphasis on arms, not enough on legs and the rest of the body), so that just leaves one workout that I use.  After a while that gets pretty boring.

My other complaint is the ""witty"" and ""helpful"" comments from Lisa.  I've enjoyed her books, acting, and blog in the past, but after you've heard her comments a couple times during the workout, that gets old.  It would have been better to just have the instructor do the talking, explaining what to do on the exercises, and leave the celebrity comments out.",1390435200,5,705,4.519685039370079
5972485,5,B00F9JP39A,"This is a good 49 min workout if you play straight through and do both workouts plus the warm-up and cool-down.  Shoes, 3 and 5 pound weights, a mat, and a chair are needed.  The instructor is low key and easy going--she leaves the commentary and joking to Lisa, who delivers one-liners with a sweet smile throughout.  These aren't your impossibly bronzed and fit athletes but look like your next door neighbor or coworker--""everyday women"" as the pitch says.  For each move, they do different levels so you can choose to follow the advanced or less advanced versions.  The first workout didn't get my heart rate up much, but I went straight through to the second which was more challenging--used the weights more and focused on speeding things up for some of the moves.  Definitely a keeper!",1390262400,4,792,4.744525547445256
5972486,5,B00F9JP39A,"As a 40 year old woman with Fibromyalgia, I was so excited to find that I can actually do this ENTIRE workout (both of them!) and adjust it if needed according to what is flared up that day.  It is FUNCTIONAL fitness...not get you skinny and buffed fitness.  I love the personal trainer that leads it and the fact that they use ""real"" women.  If you are a fitness junky and looking for a challenge, this is not your workout.

I think its a great workout for those just wanting to maintain their weight and perhaps tone a little.  I'm 41 (would love to be 5-10lbs less always but I'm not overweight at all) ... last year I did a few BeachBody programs including:  ChaLEAN Extreme, Brazil Buttlift & Hip Hop Abs.  Those are great for ""dropping"" the pounds but not something I want to continue to do everyday.  It's just plain too hard to keep up ... I don't always want to be a sweaty mess, feel drain and exhausted when I am done working out either.  So with that being said ... you can't go wrong with the Everyday Workout for Women!",1389657600,,816,4.294117647058823

5972491,5,B00F9JP39A,"I have trouble jumping up and down and dancing due to rheumatoid arthritis. I cant do yoga because my wrists have been fused and I can't straighten my hands for most of the moves or put pressure on them. I saw this video featured on ""The Doctor's"" and thought I'd give it a try. And of course, I loved and wanted to be Blaire in ""The Facts of Life."" lol  At first, I thought this is pretty easy and was able to get through the first workout on the easiest phase with no problem. I could feel my muscles engaging though. Well, a few hours later, I really felt that my muscles were definitely used. I've had this a week and I'm doing it every other day. I just love it. My shoulders feel more relaxed and so does my lower back. I even purchased one for my sister today. Thank you for this wonderful video.",1389398400,31,803,4.147435897435898
5972492,4,B00F9JP39A,"Everyday type women participate, lead by a qualified trainer.  The set is like a lounge room, a bit dark for my liking, but adequate. Not much space is needed and it gives one an overall workout.  Three levels of modifications are shown (absolute beginner upto someone of intermediate level).",1389312000,4,292,4.938775510204081

5972498,5,B00F9JP39A,I love this workout because you can make it easy to do or you can make it harder to do.  It is short and you don't dread doing it.  It is easy to do and so you can do the entire workout and feel good about yourself.  Can't say enough good things about it.,1389052800,5,255,3.685185185185185

5972501,5,B00F9JP39A,"I LOVE this DVD.  I am obese and have a hard time with exercise DVDs.  Most are too challenging for me and I can't keep up and get frustrated.  This DVD only had ONE exercise (in Workout #2) that I couldn't do.  I will say that Workout #1 has you constantly going back and forth between laying on the floor and standing, so if you have mobility issues, you may not like workout #1 as much as I did.  I don't like exercise and have never gotten in the habit of Strength Training, but now that I have this DVD, I am going to be doing a lot more of it.",1386979200,53,549,3.90990990990991
