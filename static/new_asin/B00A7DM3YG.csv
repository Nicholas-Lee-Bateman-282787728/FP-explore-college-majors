8547810,5,B00A7DM3YG,"Conversations about bootleg whiskey connote Tennessee, Kentucky, or almost anywhere in the Southeastern U.S.  So it's a real surprise when Iowa gets outed not only as a source of illegal whiskey during prohibition, but also today.  Kristian Day does a great job of finding the real people behind bootleg whiskey in and around Templeton, Iowa.

The title includes the name of a legal whiskey called Templeton Rye.  And much of this film's focus is the Kerkhoff familys progression to legitimacy.  However, there are a lot of winks and nods from those interviewed hinting there's more than the legal version of ""Templeton Rye.

The history of Iowa whiskey depicted is compelling.  Many farmers from the region testify how whiskey manufacture was used to provide an income for their families. Their fame came when discovered by the infamous gangster Al Capone.  His distribution included speakeasies around the country.  He called it ""The good stuff"" in contrast to other bootleg whiskeys of the day.

The pure heart of Day's documentary is the interviews with the great-grandmothers and fathers of today recalling childhood memories of life on the farm.  One octogenarian recounts how important it was to be ready when Capones gang would come to pick up a load.  Others speak to the ever-present fear of being caught and the ingenious ways they fooled the revenuers.  The film generates a warm feel of family and inclusion.  You will wish you had been there after hearing this wonderful tale of American lore.",1382918400,2,1507,5.048582995951417
