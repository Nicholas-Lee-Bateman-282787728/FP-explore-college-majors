6564973,5,B00M9E5NZC,"I just love these Blondie movies. No one but Penny Singleton could play the role and Arthur Lake is the perfect Dagwood Bumstead. The only it of.casting I have issue with is Jonathan Haleas Mr. Drivers.  Clarence Kolb would have been letter perfect here.  The aunty is exceptional even though the theme song is awful. Ah, the beauties of video zapping.",1430611200,5,352,4.754098360655738

6564975,5,B00M9E5NZC,"Sadly, this only has ten of the Blondie movies and the box set that has all of the movies, is not available at the present time. This set came from Echo Bridge, but the discs are from Platinum Disc Corp. of which I already have. This came with a collection of cartoons and of the few that I saw, the quality is very poor & not worth the money.",1428019200,6,343,3.9855072463768115
