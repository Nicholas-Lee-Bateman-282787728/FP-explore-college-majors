948287,2,6305020817,"Okay... so if you're only interested in the movie, of course this is quintessential John Woo melodrama-action. Chow Yun Fat is the master of matches mouth moving and handgun hysterics. But the DVD is badly flawed.  The subtitles are too big as the other review said, but they're also late  (show up after the dialogue) and inaccurate (its text from the original)  *I'm Chinese so I know--I just turn it off*. In addition, the description  is incorrect--there's no ""additional footage"" or ""behind the  scenes stuff."" Only the lightest production notes on the cast and  crew--stuff you could get from IMDB. Also the transfer is a bit faded and  lacks real richness that DVD is suppose to provide. In addition, the  annoying startup promo (which lasts over 3 minutes) before the actual menu  starts can't be skipped. I had rated this as 3 stars, but changed it to 2.  I still love the movie, but feel a little jipped--especially since I bought  the entire trilogy. Where's Criterion when you need them?",952041600,53,999,4.817647058823529
948288,2,6305020817,"A wonderful movie overall, but the subtitles are terrible and distract from enjoyment of the film.
The letters are too big, and often only four or five words are fitted per line, so an additional line of subtitles is  necessary, taking up the bottom 25 to 30% of the screen.  Can't see the  movie for the words!  The same holds true for the sequels.
I'd buy  another copy if only they'd fix this aweful production flaw.
DON'T BUY  IT!  Wait for an improved edition! Too high a cost for such a faulty  product.",950918400,16,509,4.397849462365591

Chow-Yun Fat is at his best, and unlike Chow's and  John Woo's American films, the themes are clearly defined from scene one.

948472,4,6305020817,"A Better Tomorrow is John Woo's best film on a dramatic level, and runs a hard bargain against The Killer, Hard Boiled and a couple Ringo Lam movies as the quintessential heroic bloodshed flick. In short, it's a masterpiece.

Much like the rest of classic Hong Kong action cinema, though, the US distribution has been less than respectful. The Chinese audio track of the original Anchor Bay release simply copied the one from the previous crappy Tai Seng release, which tampered with the soundtrack of the original film and added music from random Hollywood films in certain scenes. The original Anchor Bay release inherited these defects. To their credit, they recalled the original version and put out a fixed second version with the original (no new music) Chinese mono.

You can tell the difference by looking at the back: the bad Anchor Bay version has stereo Cantonese audio, and the corrected version has mono. On Amazon, there's no way to tell them apart short of emailing the seller and asking.

Even the corrected mono version isn't flawless; there's a 10 second audio dropout at the very beginning, but it's not during anything important, so it's a negligible error if you're not very picky.",1429228800,2,1202,4.911330049261084

948475,5,6305020817,"I know Jackie Chan movies for the most part. I did not know much about Jet Li or Chow Yun Fat. I ordered  Jet Li's ""Once Upon a Time in China"" movies cause I wanted to see what else is out there. Same thing goes for Chow Yun Fat. I knew they were good actors, but I had not seen much of their movies. And I wanted to start off with the earlier movies. I had read that ""A Better Tomorrow"" was supposed to be a great action movie and that it had started Chow Yun Fat off to stardom.  Some of the reviews I read about this box set made me not want to see it at first. The complaints about the subtitles not being accurate and problematic made me think it would not be worth watching. The truth is, in the first movie the subtitles are not very accurate in the translation. The subtitles say words that are wrong. As a result, sometimes the subtitles don't make sense. In the second and third movies, the translation/subtitles are better than the first. I have noticed this in other movies, the early years of English subtitles in movies was lacking at first, but they got better over the years.

As for the storyline and the movies themselves, they are good and now that I have seen them, I like them a lot. Same with the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" movies. I ordered that and the ""Better Tomorrow"" series from this same store, and the estimate for arrival was like over 30 days.... but they arrived like in 12 days. It was incredible.

948570,5,6305020817,"The best introduction i can think of for this 1986 all-time classic action thriller that started the true Hong Kong ganster genre, and its influence over the movie industry, is this: In Quentin Tarantino's own words, this film, along with Ringo Liam's ""City on fire"", was the true influence and reference behind his first masterpiece ""Reservoir dogs"", film that turned the independent ganster film genre upside down, and changed the style of movie-making forever. On top, this is Quentin's favorite movie along with Sergio Leone's masterpiece ""The good, the bad, and the ugly"". My friends, this is way more than cheap magazine trivia, it's a about a whole universe that this movie and Asian action-cinema in general, started and openned for many filmakers untill today. Or were did Martin Scorcesse found ""Infernal Affairs"" to make his oscar winning re-make ""The departed""? Were did ""Infernal affairs"" came from? A-ha!

John woo: A great true Art director, much more than the action director people think. He is all about drama, moral struggle and human values, packed of course in the most violent scenarios ever recorded on film. But why is he such a master? Let's view the character profiles in this movie, john woo's specialty in order to give depth to his films:

-Tse Ho (Ti Lung): A corrupt but honorable detective who loves his brother Kit, father, and best friend Mark, but runs a counterfeit dollar ring. When he gets double-crossed in a trade deal by the rival gang (The POW incident), he got arrested and throwed in jail for 3 years, and his father got murdered in front of his brother in revenge. After that time, he got release and search for an honest life. But now, his brother hates him, his best friend has fallen in disgrace, and he gets pressured and black mailed by the new syndicate boss, his former subordinate Shing. He represents the moral struggle and redemption.

-Mark Lee (chow yun Fat): After the POW incident, the honorable and loyal stone-cold killer detective Mark avenges his best friend Ho, in one the most bloody scenes: ""the staged dinning assasination table"" in wich Mark alone slaughters a whole gang, but got seriously injured. Now a useless crippled, after 3 years he's the humiliated janitor in the Shin organization. His re-encounter with his friend Ho gives him hope to recover his former glory, but Ho declines. He represents the spirit and the ambition to overcome anything.

-Sung Tse Kit (leslie chung): Ho's kid brother was an innocent joyful police academy student, until the POW incident, when his brother was exposed and his father killed. 3 years later, he became violent and bitter, lost every chance to get a promotion and became obsessed in arresting his brother and Shin, to prove himself decent. His girlfriend is the only real backup for his development as a character (the ""stupid"" love story that everybody hated). He represents dissapointment and anger over betrayal.

-Shing (lee chi-hung): The former shy  subordinate became boss after the POW incident, in wich both fouding members of the counterfeit syndicate, Ho and Mark, fell in disgrace. He's not a powerful character as the 3 previous ones, but he serves a purpose. He only helps putting the story togheter. A better villan in this movie was the major critic.

This Hip and elegantly violent tale is, as you can see, a powerful drama. Rousy, stylised, tense, urbane and visceral style is serving a complex emotional story, and we can feel the moral struggle of the characters in order to survive. The loyalty and self sacrifice are implied from spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies, John Woo's influence along with Akira Kurosawa. Even in the criminal world were violence is a mean to achieve golds, brotherhood and honor are everything. That emphasis elevates drama to high levels.

The music score is not only too 80's, but too hong kong for some. Cheesy as it may sound, it tries very hard to set the moods, making it very valuable as an effort. At that time and in these kind of movies, original music scores didn't have the importance they deserved. I hope you could hear what's really important here, and don't get irritated by what you know consider cheesy. I'm talking about the explosion and bullet sounds, just like old days in spaghetti westerns. Yee-haw!

In this masterpiece, we can expect elegant tracking shots, slow motion pyrotechnics, an emotional resonance in the visual beauty over the action sequences. Spectacular tear jerking melodrama and jaw dropping action. A true cinematic show in humanity and violence. And let's not forget the trenchcoat and sunglasses sporting lone hitman legend that was born here: Chow Yun Fat, the killer.

This DVD edition i don't know, i have another one, sorry.
My only intention is to invite you guys to witness such a classic masterpiece, and please pick any DVD edition you may have in hand, cause this classic will blow your minds, and hearts. Hurry!",1205107200,4,4935,4.927797833935018
948571,4,6305020817,"This is the Hong Kong action/crime film that kick started the flagging careers of director John Woo and actor Chow Yun Fat. Prior to this, both were relatively small players in the Hong Kong New Wave, Woo at one point was even seconded to Taiwan to direct desultory comedies and romances, similarly Chow was hardly box office gold. The success of the film lies in its energetic synthesis of local allegorical concerns (the 1997 handover to China, and urban dystopia), its aesthetic merits (Woo's balletic, beautifully composed action sequences) and its referential attitude to western forms (the French new wave, the Hollywood action film.) This potentially unwieldy and fragmented fabric to the film is masterfully controlled by a director and cast who rise wonderfully to the hyper-kinetic challenge of the film. ""A Better Tomorrow"" single-handedly created a new generic hybrid known as ""the hero"" film, as well as presenting action in a new and innovatively edited way, the film also weaves in a nostalgic subtext which endeared it to local audiences. The themes of friendship, loyalty, forgiveness and reconciliation are strong in the film, especially in the light of the familial and institutional breakdown that the films protagonists are surrounded by. The themes of social and urban dissolution are taken to further extremes in later films, most notable ""Hard Boiled"". One could argue that Woo made more polished later examples of ""the hero"" film, but for me ""A Better Tomorrow"" has a special original quality of its own, which has been remarkably popular in the global exchange of filmic images.

Anchor Bay's DVD is devoid of the special features one has become accustomed to from this fine company, however slight compensation is made by the picture and sound restoration. A definitive release of this Hong Kong classic is still required.",1175212800,,1849,5.163333333333333
948572,4,6305020817,"""A Better Tomorrow"" is John Woo's first tense, bloody gangster epic, and while it wasn't his best it certainly shows the potential that would be fully realized later.  It's here that Woo started developing the themes that he later explored further in ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer.""  Like those movies, ""A Better Tomorrow"" is a compelling tale of honor, loyalty and devotion set against the unlikely backdrop of the criminal underworld.  The movie's principal plot, the relationship between an ex-gangster and his detective brother, is ideal for the sort of Shakesperean moral conflicts that are always at the center of Woo films.  And like any movie, this one benefits immeasurably from the brooding, intense presence of Chow Yun Fat, even if his character is often in the background in this movie.  Fat isn't quite the indelible leading man he would become a few years later, but his Mark  does have his moments, most notably when cutting down a room full of enemies early on and later during the obligatory climactic shootout.

Strangely, though, ""A Better Tomorrow"" isn't quite as violent as I was given to expect after having previously seen Woo's later classics.  Aside from the two aforementioned shootouts, the film is generally pretty subdued for something with Woo's stamp on it.  Fortunately, the plot and characterization are more than sufficient to carry things along during the down time.  Much of ""A Better Tomorrow"" explores the relationships among its three central characters.  There's Ho, the ex-gangster and extremely tortured soul who gets out of prison three years after being betrayed by his apprentice to find out that going straight isn't going to be easy.  There's his detective brother Kit, the kind of guy that practically squeaks when he walks, sees everything in black and white, and still bears a grudge against Ho for his criminal past.  And of course, there's Mark, crippled during the aforementioned shootout scene and none too happy about it.  This guy's got plenty of rage bottled up inside him, and you know it's just a matter of time until some unfortunate people wind up on the receiving end.

Unfolding around these three guys, the movie's action is vintage Woo, plot twists and all, as Ho's cartoonishly evil ex-protege Shing tries to consolidate his power in the underworld.  Allegiances shift, the line between good and bad is repeatedly blurred, and bullets fly everywhere.  Played in a sufficiently brooding manner by Ti Lung, Ho eventually emerges as one of the most compelling characters in action movie history, a guy who struggles mighty hard to maintain his dignity and his principles even after his old life has been pulled out from under him.  Kit's sanctimony occasionally gets so irritating that even I wanted to punch him in the face, but Ho still manages to remain loyal to his brother.  The naive Kit doesn't want to see the world in shades of grey, but of course his brother knows better.

In any Woo movie, the plot is all but bound to be resolved with a frenetic shootout, and this one is no exception.  Apparently, there's nothing to help two feuding brothers get over their problems like being in a sustained gunfight together.  Anyway, while not as impressive as the legendary church battle in ""The Killer"" or the full-scale war in a hospital that ends ""Hard Boiled,"" this movie's final standoff does provide an early glimpse at the talent for staging ultraviolent gun battles that would make propel Woo (and Fat) to international renown.  At a mere ninety-four minutes, ""A Better Tomorrow"" is a bit on the short side, and occasionally somewhat amateurish, but it still showcases all of the elements that Woo fans would come to know and love.  It was up to later movies to do a sleeker and more professional job, which they certainly did.",1093132800,3,3801,4.930926216640502

948574,4,6305020817,"This is my second favorite John Woo movie with great touches of action and drama, When I first saw this film (about 5 years ago) I wasn't used to seeing this much violence on screen (And I thought Lethal Weapon was extremely violent at that time) I was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped. This film is VERY violent But compared to other action films this is REALLY tame nowadays. The minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots, some weird cuts and editing, the subs were terrible, as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad, but this is John Woo's first (if you can count heroes shed no tears) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse MUCH worse. Yun fat chow, Ti Lung and Leslie Chung have their good moments to bad moments, most of the good moments goes to Chow and Ti while Leslie had only one or two moments. The plot is like this A cop must confront his criminal brother. That's it. If your the typical Hollywood action goer this is your perfect find. But as I said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one, I'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on. But if your the Hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on. This film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre. I really recommend this film to any action fan!!!!!",1067385600,3,1530,4.207482993197279
948575,4,6305020817,"Here it is, folks: John Woo's A BETTER TOMORROW, the classic action/drama that started it all.  The film stars Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung as two brothers: one a successful counterfeiter, the other a newbie police officer.  Their friendship seems like it will never die; until on one fateful night, Ti Lung turns himself in.  From there it's a violent, double-barrelled gangster flick of a film that remains one of the biggest hits ever released into Hong Kong.  Chow Yun Fat is especially superb, however, and no doubt the highlight of the film, as Lung's best friend and an enforcer.  He has such a star presence to him you can't help but like him.  Woo's directing is also superb in his breakthrough film: the action sequences are rarely rivaled.  Action fans can't miss this ultimate slice of Hong Kong cinema.",1063411200,,812,4.757142857142857
948576,5,6305020817,"One word sums It up ""CLASSIC"". Great acting form the cast. Great story along with action. The movie is very sad and the one scene near the end that shock me. It'll propbably surprise you to cause you don't see it coming. Definately the best action movie ever made period.",1052006400,,271,4.44
948577,5,6305020817,"John Woo has made better films since (The Killer, Bullet in the Head), but A Better Tomorrow epitomizes everything about him that has captured the imagination of both Hong Kong and America.  The influence of this film has been felt in films as far-ranging as Reservoir Dogs, Dead Presidents, Desperado, and The Matrix.
In terms of filmcraft, there are still rough edges to this film that make it less than perfect.  The romance between Jackie and Kit is silly and the humour not as funny as it thinks it is.  Emily Chu overacts badly and all of her dialogue is soullessly overdubbed, and Leslie Cheung has not yet gotten in touch with the simmering complexity that will eventually make him into a fine actor.  He is embarrassing in the first half of the film.
But these flaws are easily negated by the full-grown, powerful mythology that Woo crafted out of his experience in martial-arts film.  Chow Yun-fat and Ti Lung's characters, loosely related to the characters in Woo's best martial-arts film Last Hurrah for Chivalry, are heroic swordsmen trapped in the bodies of gangster gunmen, and in this film Woo debuts the balletic gunplay which becomes his trademark.  The first occurrence of this -- Mark (Chow)'s hit on a traitorous business partner -- is simply exhilarating, both because of its historical context and the meticulous execution, which rivals the best rhythmic action scenes of Akira Kurosawa and Sam Peckinpah.  And Chow and Ti's performances, early corny humour aside, are terrific, sustaining the ultra-romantic sense of honour, friendship and loyalty which is directly interpreted from historical martial-arts epics in Chinese literature and film.  Woo's mentor Chang Cheh was a master at these stories, and Woo himself has enriched it greatly by successfully adapting them to a modern setting.
This DVD edition, despite cheap presentation (Anchor Bay should be ashamed for the chop-suey DVD menu design), is somewhat decent.  Unlike the VHS editions which bear the same artwork, this DVD *does* contain the original dialogue and music track.  A very good thing, for the earliest American VHS editions of this film had godawful dubbing.  Not a danger here, though, and the picture and sound quality I heard on this disc seem quite okay.

A tempestuous mix of gangster politics, love & hate, pathos, guns & flying bullets, ""A Better Tomorrow"" is so electrifying it will give your VCR a meltdown.",1009324800,,650,4.954128440366972
948663,4,6305020817,"It's plain to see that this is a rather old film, but there is no challenging the fact that it has stood the test of time. A Better Tomorrow is simply a good guns ablaze kill-fest, which although is not the most friendly ideology there is an added and certain comedic value due to the need to finally re-load ones gun after the millionth shot is fired.
 Standout performance would have to be that of veteran international action superstar Chow Yun-Fat (Crouching tiger hidden dragon, Anna and the King, The Replacement Killers, The Killer and Hardboilded... to name a minute portion of his filmography). This film set the standard for all other Hong Kong action films to come, as it was one of the most original storylines to screen in HK cinemas for a long time, as Kung-Fu films had been most prominent up till this cinematic turning point.
 Director John Woo, proves himself time and time again that he knows the intricate workings of crime, violence and honour among theives and all codes these imply. There is nothing more than a high bodycount, billions of bullets fired and the possiblity that the bad guy might not win... or will they? John Woo's Hollywood productions have not come anywhere near the perfection in action he was allowed to attain in Hong Kong cinema, which is unfortunate, but the cultural divide will slowly learn to part and free reign will eventually be granted to Woo, allowing him to retain and continue outstanding work such as and hopefully similar to that of A Better Tomorrow for the American masses.
 There is nothing glamerous about violence and crime as most normal humans realise, and this is made perfectly clear toward the films 'fire and brimstone' climax... will crime have paid after the dust and the smoke settles?

I originally bought the VHS for Chow Yun Fat since I had become a huge fan of his work in Anna & The King.  I can see why this film took him to super stardom.  You can't take your eyes off him when he is on screen.  Together he and Ti Lung create a very affecting team - one gangster wanting to go straight after 3 years in prison; and the other who has been horribly wounded in a gun fight that left him crippled and doing menial tasks after being the top enforcer for the mob.
The wild card in the story is Ti Lungs younger brother who is the cop trying to move up in rank, and who blames his brother for their fathers death.  How it all comes to a climax is one great film story and the action sequences are almost too much for the eyes to take in and leave you with your mouth open.

948687,4,6305020817,"While definitely not up to par with their later work The Killer (1989) A Better Tomorrow (1986) marks the first gunplay film of Chow Yun Fat and John Woo.  Chow and Ti Lung play big time Hong Kong hoods in the money making business (literally - they're counterfeiters).  Ti's younger brother Kit (Leslie Chung) is a police cadet and doesn't know what bro' is up to.  Things come to a head when Ti takes a trip to Taipei with an underling and gets nicked (he underling escapes).  Chow gathers some pistols and goes to avenge his pal.  There is a great scene of him ""planting"" guns in flower plots for later use.  Anyway he gets his man but gets clipped in the leg pretty harsh.  When Ti gets out a few years later, Chow is a nobody in the gang, limping around and cleaning the windows of the underling that Ti took the rap for.  Kit won't talk to him cause having a con for a family member has pretty much put the brakes on his career.  A job at a taxi stand won't do it and Ti and Chow decide to get a little revenge!  Great flick followed by two follow-ons.  Decent transfer (looks just like it did in the theatre - which wasn't Hollywood quality but hey that `s not important) playable on all DVD's and subtitled in maybe a dozen different languages (including English).

They're usually sold to travelers & vacationers in Asia since every one comes there looking for HK Kung Fu & action films as well as the occasional Kurosawa flick. The English subtitles and translations suffer greatly because these versions sometimes have up to 11 OTHER languages and dialects on them to maximize selling potential. The English translations and subtitles suffer not always because the translators don't know English well but because some things just don't translate at all and it would be extra legwork to add in stuff off the top of your head(For one thing many of these languages have NO possessive form and English is the planet wierdest language, IT CHANGES DAILY!) .

The acting is very good, and the cinematography is also good, though at times the night scenes are so dark that it is hard to discern what is taking place.  The action sequences are especially impressive, and there's no shortage of realistic wounds or ridiculous amounts of automatic weaponry.  The gun-fighting is not for the faint of heart.
  Unfortunately, the subtitles on the version we saw were not too accurate.  I'm no connoisseur of foreign cinema--I have no clue what is standard when it comes to subtitles--but we had to wade through a translation riddled with improper contractions (""I'll!"" instead of ""I will!"") and some other unintentionally funny comments (""I am not a dumb"").  At many times in the film the atmosphere was obviously supposed to be grave or serious, but the words on the screen made it humorous.

Woo's direction is top-notch. The character relationships were nice and defined. Why not five stars? Because while the movie is really good it does fall short because of pacing problems and the fact the action scenes are not good. Woo had not yet perfected his technique, the scenees here are merely OK but not great. Im sure at the time they were amazing but when viewed w/ Hardboiled they really s***. Just not polished.

What can I say about the movie?  John Woo and Chow-Yun Fat's early work together signalled the start of something greater, and the coming of age of Chow-Yun Fat as an action star and a great actor.

948694,2,6305020817,"First off, I would like to say that I love this movie. The movie is very dramatic, and full of action. This film revolutionized action movies, and lifted John Woo and Chow Yun Fat's career to new heights. It also exsploded the heroic bloodshed genre up through the underground to the main stream. Perhaps without this movie to start it all, there would be no Killer or Hardboiled, ect. So the movie itself is not in question. With that being said this DVD is very disapointing. I am easy to please, to have this film on DVD is enough for me, BUT.....Anchor Bay or whoever changed the audio tracks on this film. At first this seemed like an ok idea, I actually liked how they did the beginning. But that is about it. Part of the greatness of this film is its soundtrack, the hypnotic, dramatic scores John Woo uses are sensational. When you change them, you change the feel of the entire movie. They took out crucial musical scores in certain scene's and added them in ones where it was not needed. After watching this I was throughly disapointed instead of exilarated as I usaully am. (I've viewed this movie about 25 times in the past.) Fortunatly, the changed audio is only on the cantonese lanuage version so the English dubbed version is the original. Being somewhat of a purist though, I hate the lack of realizm and feeling dubbed verions portray. I recently showed The Killer to my girlfriend in the English dubbed version (I was lazy and didn't feel like reading) and regreted that I didn't select the original launage with subtitles because it lacked the emphasis and power that the pure language brings. The picture quality is fine and the sound on this English version is good, the sound on the Cantonese version has ALSO BEEN CHANGED! Why? I have no idea, I was going to give this a 3 star but I am changing it to a 2. I highly doubt that John Woo was for these changes, and the bottom line is that you cannot change a masterpiece, that is like painting stick figures on one of Michaelangelo's paintings.

This movie is a fantastic introduction for anyone who hasn't seen a John Woo movie before that he himself wrote.
But I give this DVD one star for the reason that on this DVD they completely ruin the movie by cheapening the moments which originally had no music by sticking in music from ""Forrest Gump"" and I'm pretty sure during one action sequence they REPLACED original music with music from ""SPEED"" which I find in notoriously bad taste since the music is so distinctive when you hear it. The music ruined it for me and my friends who hadn't seen this great movie before, but couldn't help but laugh at the terrible music that fades in with disgustingly absurd music cues and random fade outs.
Not only do they stick in random music, but they cut off the final song during the end credts which don't exist in this version of the movie! I wanted to see the name of the person(s) responsible for butchering this movie, but alas they felt it more fitting to cut straight to a screen saying who the DVD was authored by.

I watched ""A Better Tomorow"" 14 years ago & it instantly became my all time favourite movie.  I did a test, wondering if it would withstand the test of time. Yes, Chow Yuen Fat was more plumb on his face then, John Woo had a limited budget then, & his skill hadn't refined to his present level but from there, you could witness the testimony of what would come from them almost 15 years later.  Yuen Fatt was riveting & commanding as Mark, Ti Lung who played Leslie Cheung's elder brother & Yuen Fatt's best friend was already a veteran when he took this role & the chemistry between him & Yuen Fatt was obvious.  He played a role, succinctly summarised by one of Al Pacino's movie, as quoted,""I want to get out, but they pull me back in"".  Loyalty, betrayal, family are under scrutiny here & readers might have learnt from Sopranos already that even with mafiasos, there are certain codes that they have to abide by.  So, when the codes are broken, examples have to be set, grudges would have to be avenged or paid.  Readers would have to look closely if they would want to witness John Woo and Tsui Hark in acting.  John Woo played a Taiwanese cop who wanted to capture Yuen Fatt's character for a massacre that he committed after he avenged for Ti Lung's capture in Taiwan for a deal went wrong.  That scene had become an instant classic & would look even more alluring with John Woo's present slow motion technique.  Tsui Hark played a cameo role as a judge for Leslie Cheung's fiancee's cello audition.  John Woo's lack of refinement then was compensated by the rawness & honesty of the whole movie.  Even though the movie could be regarded as simplistic, the bond between the 3 main characters: Ti Lung, Yuen Fatt, Leslie Cheung was unmistakable.  It still gave me the goose bump, or those tingly sensation watching this movie.  Western readers might not realise that the theme song in this movie performed by Leslie Cheung was his all time favourite & it created quite a sensation in Asia then.

948760,4,6305020817,"The relationship between two brothers on opposite sides of the law, and the loyalty of friends is explored in ""A Better Tomorrow,"" an action/drama directed by John Woo.  As with any Woo film there's plenty of action here, but at the heart of the film is the story itself; and that's what sets Woo apart from all other so-called ""action"" directors.  Woo frames the drama with some astoundingly intricate and well choreographed action sequences (gun play and hand to hand fighting), but integrates the story seamlessly, which raises this film, as with all of his films, levels higher than the average action movie.  In this one, older brother Ho (Lung Ti) is a high ranking member of a crime syndicate specializing in counterfeit money; his younger brother, Kit (Leslie Cheung) is beginning his career as a detective.  Complicating matters is the death of their father (Feng Tien) and the involvement of Ho's best friend and colleague, Mark (Chow Yun-Fat), and Kit's girl, Jackie (Emily Chu).  In the end, at the core of the action, it becomes a story of love and loyalty, and the sacrifices sometimes necessary in life to make it work and give meaning to it all.  Woo has impeccable timing, not only in the action sequences, but with the drama as well; he knows how to use the camera to heighten the emotional impact of a pivotal moment, and successfully injects a caesura at just the right time, which maintains the perfect amount of tension that extends the drama and serves to hold the audience enthralled.  That he can employ these techniques equally within the action and dramatic sequences is why his movies have such wonderful flow and rhythm; it creates a ""whole"" as opposed to merely a series of scenes strung together to tell a story.  Directors of all genres would be well served to study Woo's techniques.  Woo gets the most out of his actors as well.  Lung Ti gives tremendous depth to the character of Ho, successfully conveying the inner struggle of this man attempting to make amends with the brother he loves, while the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat gives a riveting performance as Ho's closest friend.  His screen presence is dynamic and commanding.  Woo firmly establishes the depth of loyalty between the two, and skillfully the actors make it convincing and credible, which makes the final heroics all the more believable.  An exciting, memorable film, ""A Better Tomorrow"" is thoroughly entertaining, and a tribute to a truly great director, John Woo, who seems to get better with every film he makes.  For a combination of action and drama, there isn't another director in the history of movies that does it better than Woo.",973728000,4,2640,4.850779510022272

The two biggest issues with the movie are in terms of its language and musical audio. When you go to the language set up you will realize that the audio option that supports surround sound is the Cantonese audio. Some may not find this be an issue, but trust me you will want to watch the film in English. Why English? Because the original soundtrack got horrendously ""redone"" for the enhanced audio. Personally, I think the new soundtrack is considerably terrible when compared to that of the original, not just because the new tracks are garbage but because the placement doesn't make sense both thematically and logically. For example, there is a scene towards the end in which two character are having a conversation ride next to a choir of children. In the original sound mix, the children could be heard as background music while the conversation went on; however, in the remix an entirely different song cuts in right at the start of the conversation getting rid of both the mood and logic of the scene.

It is pretty sad that it was only released so far in China and Korea.

I had to write this review because this version is so perfect that I can almost smell the blood from the set, literally.
The sound was totally well divided through 7 speakers and the base sound was so well done that the gun shot were pounding my ears every time as if they are penetrating my heart.
The music track are crispy clear that they are rocking my house balconey at all times.

The blood color was so red that it almost made me shocked and made me as if I am bleeding or taste that rusty metal like taste of blood.
I thought that this is the best as it can get and there is no way that we can have any better version than this one in the future. This is it.

Only one complaint is that some of the music was replaced and I am pretty sad and I am pretty sure that it is because of the music right problem that cause that replacement. The music that has been replace was pretty sad because the previous music were all so very great.

About the movie.
When this movie was in the theater, it was really dark time for me. I was in school back then and I had no dream, I mean no dream at all.
I was at the last line from my class. My class has 62 students and I was 60 out of 62. They put the score on the board. It was so inhumane to do so.
Everyone looked at me as if I am a monster. I hated to study, I hate school.
My teachers hated me because I disobey everything. I grew hair, ran away from after school study everyday, my score was horrible, my parents never came to school.
More over, I hated going back home. It was like hell back home.
The only exit was watching movies in the double feature theater. To watch movies, I never ate lunch.

At that time, I watched this movie <A BETTER TOMORROW-A TRUE CHARACTOR OF A HERO>.
It was like a myth to me. It saved me from having a suicide.
I had a chance to have a copy of a crapy VHS later, and then a dvd, a horrible one, then a better dvd, then finally a few days ago, this amazing Bluray set that contains all three movies. (The part 3 is a waste but I can handle that.).

The first movie, comparing the second one, was not my personal best since it is more concentrate on boxoffice hit. It has a love story between Leslie Cheung and his girlfriend Emily Chu and that story was kind of cheesy.
But other then that, the movie was so very serious and represents the whole mood of the Hong Kong's caotic moment, being closer to becoming part of the China.

I remember every scene, every shot, every soundtrack, every moment like my personal life experience.

There are a few moments I want to talk about that are

When Chew Youn Fat it being punched on the top of the building by his former younger staff and now stepped up to be a boss. He brutally beat him to death with his colleages and his face becomes all bloody. It was such a brutal moments. There is no heart in this world anymore. No tears, no companionship, no oldfriendship's sake.

The other is the last ending. When Chew Youn Fat is trying to tell Leslie Cheung that you should be good to your brother, the enemy shots Chew on the head and his head is totally blews. We see his face all bloody. I truely smell the blood from that shot. The blood was so red and so real. I know that because of the newly color correction, the shot was more shocking to me and I was totally specheless. A man dies that way. No mercy in this world.

The other scese was happening on the Buddhist temple when Chew Youn Fat is waiting with his friend Lung Ti  for the guy who betrayed him to got the money for the last time and when Lung asks do you believe in god or something, Chew  says I AM THE GOD. You're one. A god can be human. A god is someone who controls his destiny. Sometimes, there's things you can't control. You win some, you lose some.

I will watch this movie with this perfect bluray again and again.

Though I tend to tilt more towards the mindless, stupid action movies like AH-nold films or American B-movies, I actually like the fact that this movie actually tries to be emotional as well as destructive and bloody. No one can do it better than John Woo. So die, b!+(#es!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the Blu Ray (questionable audio) and 4 1/2 for A Better Tomorrow.",1446508800,3,1120,4.512315270935961
