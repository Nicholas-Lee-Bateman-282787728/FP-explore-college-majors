I have been looking for something else that similar to it, that keeps my attention but its been hard unfortunately. Even a remake in Japanese or Taiwanese would be good.",1367366400,,308,4.237288135593221
8550345,3,B00AEBA9I8,"I have been a big Kim Sun ah fan since City Hall, My Lovely Sansoon, and Scent of a Woman but wasn't really into her character in this one.  Really had to stretch why she ended up with who she did - except in K-drama land if they kiss that's a deal sealer.",1364083200,,256,3.830188679245283
8550346,4,B00AEBA9I8,"Loved this contemporary tale of a very modern, career woman whose reproductive biology has been messed with by nature.  She finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with a much younger man. The story starts with her intent to go as far as her talent will take her in her career, and never to marry, much less have children.  This world-celebrated shoe designer is fraught with doubt after learning of her condition and the likelihood that she may never be able to become pregnant again.  Conflict abounds in her choice whether to go through with the pregnancy:  Career OR perhaps no career with much notoriety; marriage pressures by her traditional parents to a loving, intelligent medical doctor OR her much valued independence; and does she, despite her ""bad mom profile"", and prior intent for no children, want to have the life within her in her future as well?  Ending is a delightful surprise, as is the main character's development, and so much fun trying to outguess what comes next.  Great stuff!  Would love to see more Korean drama picked up by Amazon and a careful watch put on the vendors.",1362700800,,1107,4.794736842105263
