8100952,1,B000CR7X6K,"I purchased this DVD mainly for my 15-month-old daughter who loves horses and tv. She gave it about 2 minutes and walked away. My 3.5-year-old son gave it a little longer (7 minutes) in anticipation of funny moments that never came, then turned off the tv and called it Boring Farm. The disk inside doesn't live up to the cute jacket art and name. Quality and narration remind me of a 1970s documentary.",1153872000,2,403,4.534246575342466
8100953,5,B000CR7X6K,"This DVD is composed of real footage of a variety of farm animals.  It's narrated with information about each animal, like when their eyes open or why sheep need to be sheared.  It holds the attention of my 15 month old for the entire hour!  I love it and recommend the DVD for fellow animal lovers...young and old...but mostly young!",1151366400,3,334,4.533333333333333
