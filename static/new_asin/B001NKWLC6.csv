3719432,5,B001NKWLC6,"Wonderful collection of classic fairytales for young ones. There is such crap on TV these days, and these are very gentle but hold their attention. My daughter is 4 and likes it very much. Admittedly I bought this b/c I loved James Marshall's and Tommy DePaola's books as a child (The Stupids, Clown of God).  That said, the first DVD we put in the dvd player skips. Annoying. We have not viewed them all but am hoping for better. I may need to return. I also purchased another as a gift and am petrified THIS one may say skip too?! What to do...",1344643200,,546,4.300970873786408
3719433,5,B001NKWLC6,My grand children love these DVD. It is so nice when we are having some down time to watch them smile as they are watching them.,1332633600,,128,3.9615384615384617
3719434,5,B001NKWLC6,"The entire series of Scholastic videos are great.  They are wholesome and entertaining stories, narrated by varied and interesting voices.  My kids like seeing their favorite books on screen and hearing them narrated to moving pictures. Love this whole series.",1325289600,,260,5.475
3719435,5,B001NKWLC6,my daughter absolutely loved this video. We especially enjoyed reading it with the video. My only wish is that they made the sound available in French.,1325116800,,151,4.846153846153846
3719436,5,B001NKWLC6,"Was looking for a video with Goldilocks and the Three Bears, so we tried this one. My 7 & 4 year old daughters LOVE these movies! They've watched them over & over again, and since there are several DVDs (each with about 6 short movies), they haven't tired of them yet. And the price was SO right!",1316476800,8,296,4.2105263157894735
3719437,5,B001NKWLC6,This is a great collection of stories.  They captivate my daughter.  I love the artwork for each of the stories and the narrators are awesome - especially John Lithgow.  :),1311811200,,172,4.666666666666667
3719438,4,B001NKWLC6,"My kids are watching these over time, though it has taken them a while to warm up to them.  They will work best for kids who are really able to follow a more complex story and language; school age more than toddler or preschool.

Also, since these are traditional retellings complete with all the evil characters of the original tales, kids accustomed to Barney might find them upsetting.

One of those high-value finds that adults might find quite enjoyable along with their kids.",1308528000,24,481,4.771084337349397

3719440,5,B001NKWLC6,These DVD's provided many minutes of entertainment for my 2 grandchildren as my daughter and I took a 350 mile trip with them.  They were quiet and interested and only asked for something when it was time to put a new DVD in the player.,1264204800,17,236,4.2444444444444445

3719448,5,B001NKWLC6,I use these videos as positive reinforcers of social and character traits in guidance lessons. All of the stories are animated and hold the children's interest. There are several opportunities to ask higher-order thinking questions to prompt conversation with students.,1355270400,2,269,5.75
3719449,5,B001NKWLC6,"My girls like these.  You feel better about them watching it cause the words are there.  Maybe it will help them read:)  Most of the stories are good but there are a few weird one.  Repunzel is definitely a bit disturbing when the prince ends up blind and wondering in the wilderness alone for a year while Repunzel has their twins.  Over all there great, just be aware of the stories and choose whether all are right for your kid.",1355097600,5,431,4.3375

8327256,5,B001NKWLC6,"A great set of videos for your child - my 3 and 5 year olds have watched several of these videos countless times. The James Marshall and Strega Nona discs, in particular, are winners - good animation, strong stories, lots of humor. The other 2 discs are more hit and miss - stories and animation styles vary quite widely - but for this price we would have happily paid just for the 2 discs I mentioned.",1438300800,,402,4.302631578947368
8327257,5,B001NKWLC6,"My son and I really enjoy watching the scholastic storybook treasures together. This digital board book collection features timeless fairytale classics that are both educational and entertaining. Instead of being over stimulating, you get more of a ""book comes to life"" sensation while watching this series. The ""read along feature"" even makes you feel like you are attending a live book reading! Glad to see that the digital storybook collection has many more classics to choose from. We will have many more stories to look forward to!",1428105600,,536,5.172413793103448

8327263,5,B001NKWLC6,We have one set of these already and this is my second purchase. I really like that there are fairytale/princess stories on here without being Disney-oriented. I appreciate the simplicity of the animation and the fact that we can check the books out at the library to enhance the viewing for kids by following along in their own books.
