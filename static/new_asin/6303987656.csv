7858874,3,6303987656,"When it begins it is all three: Great, Alaska, and a mystery. As Universal often did its arctic scenes of ships, men, and icebergs  relies heavily on old stock footage but which actually blend in with and fit the action. But once who the good guys are and the bad guys are and all are rescued from the elements, we find ourselves in an Alaska that is the same old Iverson Ranch in North LA County we have seen over a zillion times and its just another serial. There is a brief relief when our good guys are forced to cut fresh timber for their mine and we have real Alpine scenery and a big logger's truck, but only for a chapter. Baby Boomers and seniors will recognize most of the cast, all excellent, veteran players who crossed over both B movies and big budget films, so the story line and acting are first rate. But the overall effect is greatly reduced by the obvious southern California scenery and sunshine... Alaska it aint.",1323388800,3,934,4.398843930635838
