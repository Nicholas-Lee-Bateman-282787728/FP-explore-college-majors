8092825,3,B000BU734K,"Over all a good product but disc #1 did not play on two  dvd players. Already had ""The Youngest Godfather"" which is the same as part 1. Eventually found a player that disc #1 did work on. Disc #2 worked okay on all players.",1347667200,2,223,4.068181818181818
8092826,5,B000BU734K,"This movie was on Showtime recently and I DVR'ed it.  I've watched it several times since, picking up some new detail, connection, or nuance each time.  It is a great real-life account of a mafia godfather.  It is not a documentary and there are some parts of the movie that are pure speculation.  For example, it portrays the assassination of JFK as a mafia plot, recording some details, such as shooter placement, that have largely been disproven.  Also, the attempted killing of Frank Costello is slightly off.  But if you keep in mind that some of the details are fictionalized, you'll see a great movie and learn a bit about the interworkings of the mob.  Enjoy!",1275609600,10,667,4.698275862068965
