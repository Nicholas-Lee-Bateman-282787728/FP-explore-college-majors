6098415,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I didn't plan on seeing this film until I bought both Hunger Games steelbooks that came with two free passes. I was not expecting much at all due to the reviews, but I'm happy to report that Divergent is way better than the critics are saying. It's not quite up to The Hunger Games, but it also strays far away from the awful Twilight franchise, which I was initially afraid it would end up being. The story is interesting and the cast is pretty good, especially Shailene Woodley as Jennifer Lawrence lite. I have a feeling the sequels will be even better since this is really just a long, yet engaging setup.",1395446400,,609,4.446428571428571
6098416,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent was a great ride, so fun, very good looking, and it will only get better, trust me im a doctor....no im not, but the story is so very different than Hunger games if you were wondering, i don't want to spoil it for you guys but keep on this series guys!!!",1395446400,,264,4.096153846153846
6098417,5,B00GQQ77IU,"""Divergent"" will inevitably be compared by many to that other YA book series, ""Hunger Games."" And while both books have strong young heroines, the books and movies are actually quite different. See the movie and judge for yourself. I went to see it with my family, but the theater had audiences of all ages - from older 40-50 something couples, to groups of high school-college friends, to middle schoolers with their friends or families. I would recommend this to the same audience that went to see ""Hunger Games"" - PG-13 and up.

For those not familiar with Veronica Roth's book, ""Divergent"" is the story of Beatrice (Tris) Prior, a young lady living in futuristic Chicago. Due to post-war effects, their society is divided into 5 factions that represent 5 virtues - Abnegation (selflessness/service to others), Candor (honesty), Dauntless (bravery), Amity (peace) and Erudite (knowledge/learning). Those who do not belong to a faction (basically, ostracized from society) are called ""factionless."" When they come of age, they attend a ceremony to select the faction they will join for the rest of their lives. Most choose the faction they are born in, while others may ""defect."" During the pre-ceremony aptitude test, Beatrice is told that her test results were ""inconclusive"", meaning she doesn't see to belong to a specific group. They call this ""Divergent."" Their society views ""Divergents"" as dangerous so Beatrice must keep this secret to protect her life.  When she chooses her faction, she meets her new mentor and trainer Four and the brutal Eric and forms friendships with other new initiates Christina, Will and Al.  The physical and mental training (think ""boot camp"") is intensive and challenging and Tris needs to find a way to survive. She eventually finds an ally in Four, who isn't quite what he seems.

The movie does a great job introducing the faction-based society to audiences, so you don't need to have read the book to enjoy or understand the plot. Having read the book, I would say I am very satisfied with the casting choices and the outcome of the film. I would consider this a faithful adaptation to the book - some scenes were excised due to time constraints and/or continuity/flow, but this is understandable if you take into account the differences between the book vs. film medium.

In terms of casting, I admit I was skeptical about Shailene Woodley (Tris) at first. Physically, she doesn't quite match up to book Tris (who is supposed to be small and waif-ish). But Shailene has the ability to take on this role of a vulnerable and conflicted young woman at the beginning of the film who grows in strength and confidence as the story goes on.  Some would say that Theo James is much older than his book counterpart, but I can clearly see why he was chosen to play the complex Four. Theo plays Four with quiet strength and charisma - he is an imposing authority figure, but there is some vulnerability a well. He won me over from the first scene and he and Shailene have an undeniable chemistry. Kate Winslet (Jeanine Matthews), Jai Courtney (Eric) and Miles Teller (Peter) are also stand-outs. The remaining main supporting cast are Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd (Tris' parents), Ansel Elgort (Caleb - Tris' brother), Ray Stevenson (Marcus Eaton) and Tris' fellow initiates Zoe Kravitz (Christina), Ben Lloyd Hughes (Will) and Christian Madsen (Al).  They capture the essence of their book counterparts very well and, while they are currently relative unknowns, I can see bright futures for the young cast. (And, yes, girls and boys, whether intentional or not, there is a lot of ""eye candy"" in this movie. I get it. Even Jai Courtney's Eric looks good in a dangerous/tough guy sort of way). Four is my favorite character in the book series and I am pleased to see that Theo James more than lives up to expectations.

The film was shot in Chicago so the filmmakers had to perform some digital magic to make it look and feel like a post-war, dystopian society. Costumes and sets all look spot on. It all works. Director Neil Burger injects pace, energy and a sense of foreboding and danger to the film. As soon as Tris leaves her faction, the action kicks off. There are lots of fight scenes between the initiates and among various characters, and yes, there is violence akin to what you would see in the ""Hunger Games"" series. There is also a budding romance - and while it is not as heavy a focus as it is in the books, it is equally satisfying.

As a big fan of the first 2 books (""Divergent"" and ""Insurgent""), I was very satisfied with the outcome. So many books out there get ripped to shreds by the time they make it to film, so I am glad to see that the screenwriters were very diligent in capturing the essence of this dystopian world and the characters that we love so much, and did not feel the need to change the story drastically. The plot follows that of the book and several key scenes are intact (albeit shorter and more compact) - whatever changes are made are relatively minor in comparison. The main characters are there, and there are more minor characters that may have been excised or will make an appearance in the next film. We hope this movie does well enough so that ""Insurgent"" is made, because that follow-up brings us more dimension to the story and fleshes out the role of these characters. For example, Marcus Eaton, Jeanine Matthews, Caleb, Peter and the Candor, Amity and Erudite factions, and Four's background are expanded more in the second book and new characters will be introduced.

My family and I came out of this film having a few discussions afterwards. Overall the reaction was very positive and we all enjoyed it immensely, so much so that we are all planning to see it again. I would highly recommend this movie not just to the book fans, but those who enjoy futuristic, dystopian films. Young and adult alike in my household enjoyed this film so it works for a broad range of audiences.",1395446400,528,5966,4.75
6098418,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I read the Divergent book, and I really enjoyed the movie.  The casting is well done, and the acting is great.  The adaptation is faithful to the book.  My love of the first book made it easy to embrace this movie.

If I were watching the movie with fresh eyes, I think I would probably find the movie a little hokie, maybe even cheesy.  In the midst of the distopian future, there's some real ""high school movie"" influence.  If you're into it, then you should be able to role with it.  But if your girlfriend dragged you to the movie, it'll probably enduce some heavy eye-rolling.",1395360000,,581,4.4245283018867925
6098419,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I just went to see Divergent in theaters and I really would recommend purchasing the dvd. However, I also would recommend to read the books before watching the movie. If you do not have time to read, it would not affect much. Divergent is one of the few  movies that I have gone to see that stay true to the books. The movie is very action packed with a love story. This movie is very unique and I think that many people, young or old can receive a BEAUTIFUL message from it. This movie is very worth the purchase.",1395360000,,514,4.191919191919192
6098420,5,B00GQQ77IU,I just came back from watching this and loved it. The two leads had great chemistry and played their parts well. I can't wait for this to come out on blu ray,1395360000,,157,3.9375
6098421,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Films based on young adult novels are either a major hit or a complete miss.  Each time one of these adaptations is released, the immediate reaction is to compare it to the successful (monetarily speaking, at least) novel-to-film endeavors, such as The Hunger Games, Twilight, or Harry Potter.  But, with so many sub-par box office returns within the last few years from films like Beautiful Creatures, Vampire Academy, and The Host  - these youthful adventures are starting to earn a bad rap.  Why do some succeed while others miserably fail?  In all honesty, it comes down to the feature films presentation and the plausibility of the story  plus it doesnt hurt to have a recognizable face starring in the film.  And, as all of this pertains to Divergent  it would appear (for the moment) the prospects are bright for the future of this potential franchise.

Based on the novel by Veronica Roth and directed by Neil Burger (Limitless, The Illusionist), Divergent stars Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior, the daughter of two prominent members of the Abnegation faction.  In a post-war, desolate world that has been fenced-off from the rest of the world, Beatrice has reached the age where the time has come to take an induced placement exam that is supposed to tell her whether or not she should remain in her current faction or choose one of the other four very different factions  either Amity, Candor, Dauntless or Erudite.

After taking her exam, she is shocked to discover that her test results came back as divergent  a small fraction of the population that think outside the box and are heavily feared, by leaders like Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), due to their ability to ask too many questions and disrupt the system. Keeping the test results to herself, she eventually decides to switch factions  joining the thrill-seeking, fearless Dauntless.  However, new arrivals cant just join the factions  they must prove and earn their place.

Initially, Beatrice (now going by the name Tris) finds it difficult to complete with her fellow new arrivals.  She must learn how to fire weapons, complete in hand-to-hand combat, and avoid finishing in the bottom tier of her class  where she would become an outcast without a faction.  However, Tris forms a bond with one of the Dauntless instructors, called Four (Theo James), who helps keep her motivated and prepared for whatever might come her way.  And, even though it would appear that making Dauntless is her greatest obstacle, she eventually realizes there are far grander issues to consider as the other factions continue to be at odds with one another.

Much like Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games films, Shailene Woodley should be praised and commended for being able to take on such an emotion-filled character and giving her such a dominant onscreen presentation.  Woodley, who is quickly rising through the ranks of young Hollywood actresses, proves that she has the ability to carry  not only a film  but also a franchise.  To call her anything other than exquisite in this role would be a monumental lie and theres little doubt that this film (critical acclaim or not) will propel her character even higher than its current trajectory.

While Woodley is the star of the film and incredibly enjoyable in her role, she is really outshined by the presence of newcomer Theo James.  To many, he will be unrecognizable as his film resume is far from lengthy  but he is currently starring in the CBS drama, Golden Boy.  In any event, James brings a secretive, brooding element to a film that would be completely different with any other actor.  His role, not unlike David Boreanaz from his days of playing Angel, is slightly more powerful than everyone else around him.  As the film progresses, so does his growing (and pleasant) chemistry with Shailene Woodley, and both of these characters find that they have far more in common than you could possibly imagine, at least based on their initial meeting.

The major antagonists of the film include Kate Winslet  whose character is almost a mirror image from the role that Jodie Foster played in the recent dystopian action flick, Elysium.  Still, its nearly impossible to find a role in Winslets career where you can make the case that she performed badly.  No, her character doesnt have a huge role in the film, but her character carries enough weight that it needed a prominent actress like Winslet to sell the part.  And, when Winslet is not around, the film has to rely on another rising Hollywood star to play the aggravating foe  Jai Courtney.  Nearly the exact opposite of James character, Courtney portrays another Dauntless instructor, Eric  who has no problem inflicting his aggression on those that defy him.

The only real major downsides to this film are that it progresses in the same manner as all the other young adult films out.  You have this protagonist that is special  almost like a chosen one type character, who refuses to conform to the rules of society.  The fact that this style of storytelling is far from original hampers it and holds it back from being anything more than your typical popcorn movie.  And, this film does progress at a rather enjoyable pace, it feels like it takes too long to get to the climax, and once you arrive to that moment, the film attempts to do too much too quickly  forcing the film to feel like it has a pacing issue.

Overall, a case can be made for Divergent as being an exciting adventure, but also a case against it as being just another young adult film adaptation with the same old defiant characters and familiar plot progression.  Where you land on that particular side of the fence will likely have to do with whether or not youve read the books and are a fan of those novels.  By no means is Divergent better than The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, but it is eerily similar to Twilight  yet the acting is far superior to Twilight and even as engaging as The Hunger Games.  Since Divergent is only the first film in a set of three popular novels, they likelihood that sequel, Insurgent, gets green-lit for a feature film will hang on the box office success of Divergent.  But, at this state, it would appear the entire trilogy has an excellent chance of telling its full story on the big screen.

6098431,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Watched this with my 10yo daughter. She enjoyed it.
I'd say it was as though the author saw The Hunger Games, The Matrix, 1984 and a few other cliche sci-fi films (or books) and decided to combine them in to one girl-power story.

It was a pleasant watch but left us both saying ""yeah, I'd watch the others at some point.""

The acting was decent but a bit of forced edginess peppered every scene.

Set design looked very ""studio lot"" in a lot of places.

Ultimately it was a basic modern ""B"" sci-fi movie with a tween girl tilt. Worthwhile if you're in a pinch for something to watch.",1524873600,,584,4.330275229357798

It is like 2 movies. The first hour or so was pretty good imo. It had me interested in her character, and her journey with her new faction and making the cut. There was chemistry with one of her ""leaders"" Four, and the action sequences throughout her training were good.

And then it all fell apart. At the point where the serum was used against all of her squad mates the movie devolved into some sort of high school production, it was so poorly done. I actually thought it was intentional, like it was to let us know later how it wasn't real but part of a simulation test or something, but nope...

6098496,5,B00GQQ77IU,"This book adaptation of a young adult, dystopian genre is actually really good.  It gets a bad reputation because of its similarities to other books of its kind, but I don't care.  It's perfectly pleasant and easy to follow, albeit the actual plot is a little confusing.  Who doesn't love a story based around a strong, empowered young woman?  I would recommend watching the sequel movie, Insurgent, which is surprisingly better than the book.  But do not go any farther.  The third book and movie, Allegiant, is absolute trash and you're better off just stopping while you're happy.",1506384000,,583,4.8979591836734695

6098518,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is the first of three , the first one is about  a couple of kids that  to decide on
how there lives are to be in the future,by taking a test and the results will let them know
what side there on and with this , they will have ti leave there family
Divergent is the best of the best and if your test result shows this, most likely
you will be killed, this part of the movie is focused on the test itself
trish(shalene woadley)- passes her test and gets her buttt kicked,
and is saved by one of the leaders and she manages to fight the final fight in this series
against the leader of the whole world, played kate winslett, it will make you cringe and you could say, love was found,
this movie is good and if you ever watched HUNGER GAMES, this will put your mind in the same place, there was more than one part of that series as well, if you liked it, you will love this one!!",1500076800,2,885,4.0227272727272725

Very similar to Hunger Games, but way better as its characters are much deeper in their emotional displays and the groups are divided with a much more complex design than Hunger Games' haves and have-nots.

No character development, almost nonexistent background detail, minimal understanding of the relationship between the characters, had no connection w/any of them. Movie left me empty & emotionally perplexed. Hesitant to watch the next movie in the series, but curious as to how it's going to be played out, due to the major deviation from the book!?!

6098640,3,B00GQQ77IU,"I enjoy watching this but I am not going to pretend it's an amazing movie. There are a number of differences from the book series, which make the movie seem sillier than it needed to be. For instance, the leadership and conspiracy points which are set up here and then, pardon the pun, divergent to the nth degree in the Insurgent movie, were far better explained in the writing. So many people saw this movie and thought it was nothing more than a Hunger Games ripoff, and it's easy to see why they thought that. The movie fails to set up some of the deeper character nuances and relationships and instead just jumps into a sometimes boring story about a teenage girl getting to be completely awesome just because she's ""pretty"" and likes a man who likes her back and gives her support. It's still entertaining to me but it's definitely not of high caliber.",1484092800,,858,4.541935483870968

6098657,5,B00GQQ77IU,"First of all, I love this book and the entire series. Go read it if you have not. Like seriously. Right now.

Now for the Q&A session about the movie.

Question 1. Does this book follow the plot of the book?
Answer: Great question. I hate it when movies do not follow the book. *cough* Scorch Trials. But the movies was decent, the first one was great, and loved the books. Anyways. This movie does follow the book very well, and basically everything is included and fits what happens in the book.

Q2. Is the acting good?
A2. Yes, Shailene Woodley, Theo James, and more do an excellent job in portraying their characters actions, emotions, etc. I also liked how the characters sort of looked like how I pictured them in my head for the most part and that they looked basically how they were described for the most part.

Q3. What ages should see this movie?
A3. Concepts might be hard to understand for younger audiences, might be some language but I do not remember there being any, see one character's back when he shows his tattoos but there is nothing that would prevent anyone from seeing it besides intense scenes and hard to understand content/violence (like the serums, mind control stuff, the factions, the fighting, etc) So PG-13 is a good rating for it, but it's not on the higher end of that scale.

Price: Amazing price. I got this for $4. I do not know how long that price is staying but I am glad I saw this item when I did. SO obviously a great price.",1483315200,,1468,4.4222222222222225
6098658,3,B00GQQ77IU,"IF you liked every installment of the hunger games, this is the NEXT movie for you.  Not at all for guys.

The soundtrack is flawless, the characters are consistent (which is HUGE for me), the acting is perfect, there's kissing but only at the right moments, and because of the setting, not everything is predictable. I also found the main character very easy to relate to because she is always trying to improve herself.

6098750,3,B00GQQ77IU,"The books were fun.  The movies are less so.  Leading actress Shailene Woodley is only somewhat believable as the Divergent heroine at the center of the trilogy, and the love connection between herself and actor Theo James seems like a cardboard cut-out of love.

6099034,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I'm according the movie four stars because it's pretty inarguably moderately entertaining, and because Shallene Woodley is both talented and perfectly cast as Tris.  That said, I feel about Dauntless the way I did about Slytherin in the Potter novels.  Why have a House (or a faction) reserved to the savage, deranged and those most frequently possessed of psychopathically sadistic proclivities?  From *whom* are they supposed to be protecting the citizens?  The most riotously violent people to be found in the population are mostly the members of Dauntless (which is *such* a good quality, because the urge to take insane, violent, suicidal risks and to treat each other homicidally is obviously what you want in members of your law enforcement faction. NOT.) -- so apparently Dauntless exists just to protect society from Dauntless. So the movie's well-acted, the plot's interestingly convoluted, and the presence of a protagonist driven to jump off rooves and glory in rambunctious, simian behavior makes me wholly unable to sympathize.  If she had defected to *any* other faction, I could well have understood, but Dauntless? My immediate reaction was, ""she's deranged and I don't want anything further to do with the character.""",1466726400,2,1235,5.280612244897959

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

Although there are a whole bunch of these dystopian stories out there, we liked this one quite a lot. Trice's character wasn't setup for you to fall down and worship her, like some of the other heroes in these movies seem to be.

6099264,1,B00GQQ77IU,"Really really bad. Not only is it conceptually bad to begin with, but the execution was mediocre and the casting was horrible.  In a fantasy, the key is making the world work within it's own rules. This story has no concern for that ideal.  Characters behave erratically as necessary to move the story in the pre-designed direction.  We're supposed to buy character interaction simply because it's presented to us.  There's nothing that makes you believe anything that is happening.  It's just all around as bad as I can imagine a movie like this being.

6099287,2,B00GQQ77IU,"Enjoying this particular movie depends on how much the viewer has in common with either of the two main characters- the more, the better (age, gender, body type, etc...). This production is built specifically for teenagers, and I say that as a fan of the Hunger Games. Here's the difference: the plot in The Hunger Games centers on correcting injustice far and succeeding in the face of loss and change. This movie, however, is more about about finding a place to fit in, how parents just don't understand, and how the young people are the only ones who really ""get it."" The teens (and maybe twenty-somethings) should love this movie, but beyond them, there's a bit of a disconnect. Sadly, this production got boring along the way, and I hope the next installments are better.",1459209600,,776,4.7555555555555555
6099288,5,B00GQQ77IU,It was an amazing movie. It was my second time watching it and I really enjoyed it again. I loved the storyline it never gets old.

6099335,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I can't say how disappointed I am in this movie.  I always make a point of reading the books first and I'm glad I did with this because the movie has none of the fierceness, strength, danger, raw emotion, adventure, and complexity that the book did.  As an adult, I loved the book.  It had strong female characters, a complex plot, and some of the characters were even frightening in the book.  The movie is just the opposite and seems silly and unreal.  Although the basic premise, a society divided by factions and Divergent being one that can't be controlled and the names of the characters/factions are the same, the similarities end there.  So much was changed that the story isn't even the same and what replaces it is a weaker, disjointed tale with little substance to keep the viewer interested and entertained.  Key characteristics of characters were even changed.  I would still highly recommend reading the book but skip this movie altogether.  It will frustrate you to no end.  They ruined what could have been a really awesome movie.  I suppose it's because they wanted to keep that PG-13 rating for teenagers but honestly, there were creative ways around that.  This was a failure in all aspects.  I expect if I hadn't read the books first, this movie would have put me off to it.  Even the main character was made to seem much weaker overall than she does in the book.  One of the worst book adaptations I've seen.",1458691200,,1429,4.637450199203188

6099358,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Four INTRODUCTORY Stars. ""Divergent"", based on the novel by Veronica Roth, is a post-apocalyptic movie along the lines of ""Hunger Games"" but very confined in location, themes, and conflict. After a terrible world war, only some in the world survived. Hundreds of years later, survivors are living and thriving inside Chicago, surrounded by a wall, and split into 5 functional, allegedly harmonious factions, except for the factionless. But there is an internal power struggle and there are secret 'divergents' who don't fit any faction and could be a threat. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior emerges as a focal point and leader. Early on, it seems more time than necessary is spent on ""Dauntless"" and their rituals and less on other factions, but it helps the overall conspiracy and storyline since we are following Tris' development. Directed by Neil Burger. Starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zo Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet.  Well acted, well plotted in a unique universe and Very Definitely Recommended. Four DAUNTLESS stars (Summit Entertainment and Red Wagon Entertainment. PG-13. HD Color. CC. X-Ray. 2:19:40. Note: This movie ends on a minor cliff-hanger leading to the next installment, ""Insurgent"", which I was intrigued enough to buy. Two more movies are planned after that.)",1458000000,4,1384,5.348623853211009

6099407,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Coming from a parent's perceptive this movie was really well made for the teenage age group.  There was no unnecessary trashy language that seems to be in every movie these days.  This movie is nothing like the awful ""Hunger Games"" movies.

PG13 is the correct rating for the movie because there is minor killing in the end, but for a good reason.

I would prefer to see more movies like Divergent than a group of kids killing kids.  When Hollywood producers make movies where every aspect of the movie is portraying to teens that it is okay to kill other kids then you have kids bringing guns to school.  As God says in the bible ""teach your child in the way you want your child to go"" and if we had more God baring parents who would teach their child that killing other children is wrong then our society would be a better place for our children.",1457136000,,848,4.369426751592357

Especially when it comes to movies in a series, I like to watch them again before seeing new ones in the series. We rented Insurgent (the second movie in this series) tonight and watched this one first so that we were watching the sequel with fresh eyes. This saved me from renting an additional movie or buying a copy of this movie. It's great, but I recommend you read the book before watching the movie.",1456272000,,543,4.3861386138613865

6099572,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is a dystopian science fiction that finds itself suffering from the stereotype Hollywood has created for recent book adaptations. It is a very formulaic and predictable storyline that is immersed in an intricately-built world. However the acting is insanely good, particularly Shailene Woodley, who makes everything feel much more real. The only issue was the repetitive theme of 'Chosen One' fights against oppressive government force.

6099582,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Having just read the book as usual the movie is a disappointment. Not that it's a particularly bad movie, but because of necessity it cuts so much of the detail that made the book such a good read. Don't get me wrong, Theo James as Tobias is handsome and Shalene Woodley as Beatrice is impressive but so much of their interaction including their romance is truncated in the movie. As usual certain scenes are altered to move the plot along. No matter how good CGI and stunt actors may be your imagination is always better. Mind you the ride down the zip line is spine-chilling.

The remainder of the crew are not as well cast and most of the other initiatives play background roles.",1452124800,,682,4.5

One of my biggest complaints is that quite a few important scenes were changed or left out completely - scenes that would be necessary for character development and subsequent movies. While that isn't a deal-breaker, it definitely annoyed me to see how much certain aspects were changed. But again, this is all because I read the book before watching the movie.

My husband, who didn't read the books and had no background other than watching the trailer, was thoroughly confused as to why the Dauntless were ""running around doing hardcore parkour"" in every scene.

6099594,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This movie, although fairly enjoyable, was only a pretty good adaptation from the book, and for those who have not read the book, this film may be confusing. If you have read the book, I would give this movie four stars, and if you have not, then I would give it three, or maybe even two. These two alternate reviews are as follows.

If you have read the book:
In this case, I would give this movie a four star review. I would give it five, if it were not for the facts that the adaptation from the book to the film, and even though the  book did give the main story, it was still slightly confusing, even after reading the book. That being said, this was a pretty good movie, and it was entertaining to me. I thought that most of the people were cast pretty darn well, except for Tris, who should have been cast much different. I also thought that it was interesting how Tris and the person who played Caleb both co-starred in The Fault in our Stars. Just thought that it was a strange coincidence. Overall, I thought that if you have read the book, this is a good movie, and you will enjoy it. But it is a whole different story if you have not read it.

If you have not read the book:
If you have not read the book on which this movie was based, I recommend that you do not watch it. It may be entertaining just because it is movie, something to look at, but it will be confusing, you won't know any of the backstory and who anybody is, and what is going on will seem strange and will not make sense to you. I guess that I am not saying do not watch this movie,  I am just saying that it will be confusing and you may not be able to follow it very well.

It is unfathomable to me that anyone would actually like this movie. I went in thinking it was Sci Fi (which it resembles a high school cafeteria cliques more than science fiction) only to learn it was young adult. It's not a bad thing, I guess, since Harry Potter was pulled off well and The Hunger Games (while not as fantastic as the media would have you believe) was also ok.

No character had depth, the story was convoluted (again, high school cafeteria), the acting was bad, etc. The only saving grace was I watched it on something that let me fast forward through the cliches, which turned out to be large swaths of the movie.",1451779200,,731,4.53030303030303

She gets a tattoo, and the hots for some guy named Four. She then plays paintball, before going zip-lining. She drops some form of futuristic injectable LSD, and has a bad trip involving Crows. Later she begins to realize that she has superpowers. She grows a pair and marches into the nerd school to visit her jerk brother. Some big bully tries to throw her off a cliff, but her boyfriend sweeps in and saves the day. The insecure bully who tries to kill her decides to commit suicide. Her schoolmates all turn into zombie-millitary-pawns, and she chimes in on the party and murders one of her friends. Her mother comes running up wearing a burlap sack and carrying a gun, and they enjoy some quality mother/daughter time shooting her classmates. After her mother gets shot and killed, she has an epic crying tantrum before picking weapons off the dead and running away. Then she preaches to her friends that the best course of action to stop the war, is to shoot as many people as they can. She and her boyfriend decide have a major fist-fight with a few WWF moves, to express how much they care about each other.

It's easy to portray the rise of fascism- Hunger Games does it also- but, from my point of view as a leftist Christian- these stories end up praising weaponry (like bows and arrows) and praising the military faction- Dauntless. Even Trtiss mother was originally in Dauntless. Dauntless seems like a bunch of subhuman world federation wrestlers. Navy Seals or ISIL.
We fought for, and continue to, the ideals of non violence in the 60's- do these authors never go beyond the agenda of- two lovers, humanity, caring, love for humanity?

6099663,3,B00GQQ77IU,"This isn't a bad movie, though the influence of 'The Hunger Games' is very obvious. The action is good, the acting is acceptable and although it is set in the future it isn't overwhelmed with computer graphics. The main drawback I found with it (apart from being half an hour too long) is that nothing much is done with the central idea of the heroine being divergent. It doesn't stop her from joining a faction, it doesn't appear to help her with her chosen career and although there are dire warnings throughout the film that she must not tell anyone there is no plotline dealing with her disclosure or unmasking. In fact, the only reason for calling it 'Divergent' at all seems to be a single line near the end of the movie.

In watching it I was reminded of the late great sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov, who wrote a story back in 1957 called 'Profession'. In that story, the failure of the system to assign the hero to a suitable profession is made the centerpiece of the plot, with a twist which seems obvious once it is revealed, but is hard to anticipate and leaves your mind buzzing. This movie needed a writer with Asimov's capacity for lateral thinking.

6099677,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is a movie about a futuristic rundown Chicago where everyone's divided into five factions based on their virtues.  Shailene Woodley stars in this movie, and it would seem she's an outcast and doesn't belong to any faction but has tremendous skills and knows how to defend herself, which places her in a top category of elite fighters.  The idea is that you must eventually commit to one of the five virtues, and those five virtues are the following- Candor (honesty), Abnegation (selflessness), Dauntless (the bravery), Amity (peacefulness) and Erudite (intelligence).  The movie does a pretty good job bringing out each one in Shailene.

This movie clearly takes several notes from the Matrix based on the special effects, which is sort of an aggravating approach in my book because the film often settles for an exaggerated storyline and appearance which often interferes with the plot.  Anyway Shailene isn't travelling on this dangerous adventure alone- she brings along Theo James (who of course cares deeply about Shailene- what else is new), the guy who doesn't contribute much (Ansel Elgort) and the tattle tail rat (Miles Teller).  I personally wouldn't save Miles at all because he's the one responsible for forcing Shailene and others on the run from the gunmen early on, which basically starts all the chaos.  Later on when the group is stuck in a tricky situation and Miles is forced to join up with them... nah sorry- no forgiveness on my end!  I'd have shot the guy the moment I was free.

Also Kate Winslet is in charge of organizing the faction by placing people through intense tests to see how they handle it, and later makes Shailene face five tests.  Each one is basically a test to see how powerful and courageous Shailene is.  The Matrix comparisons are REALLY strong here but admittedly makes for enjoyable storytelling (especially watching Shailene swing from ropes around buildings being lifted off the ground and watching the ground crumble below- heh, I couldn't help but notice flying over such a rundown miserable looking city was the only way to make it look pretty!

The movie has a way of being most entertaining in the beginning when Shailene and company hang around villages out in the country, and it picks up the pace even more when gunmen storm into the place and look for Shailene prompting her and her friends to run away and board a train (with MORE troubles!)  This, along with the way Shailene goes through with thodse dangerous tests near the end, are the two high points of the movie.  Unfortunately Divergent tends to drag on occasion.  After the train ride the pace slows down drastically and forces some confusing storytelling into our brains.  However I think Hunger Games fans would enjoy this movie.  Also Maggie Q plays a part, but isn't shown enough to make an impact.  Her importance wasn't clear to me.

I don't know, Divergent has its moments, but the storyline often ventures down confusing paths (hey what else is new when it comes to science fiction, the most confusing genre of movies there is!) and lacks a consistently high-octane pace and prefers settling into slow-moving grooves from time to time as a means to further the progression of the characters, but this isn't exactly executed with ease or excitement.  You have excitement for a little while, then you have slow parts that require close attention on the viewers part to grasp it all.  Back and forth between the two the whole time.  Actually Kate Winslet is probably the best character in the movie based on how determined she is to squeeze out the best in Shailene, and how she's willing to kill without any care in order to go through with it.  Still, decent enough for science fiction lovers I suppose.",1449878400,,3739,4.853543307086614

By: Alaina Arens

So today I am here writing to you about the movie Divergent, but first I wanted to ask you what your favorite type of movie genre is. If you said dystopia, you're in luck because Divergent would be exactly what you're looking for!

Divergent is a movie about a town and people who are put into what are called factions and are labeled by what their strengths are and what defines them, the 5 factions are: abnegation, erudite, dauntless, amity, and candor. The main character, Tris is one of the Divergent people and there is only one person who can be fully divergent and Tris is 100% divergent.

Tris has a brother a mom and a dad and also a boyfriend later in time, named Four he is also one of the main characters in the movie. Both Tris parents get killed by abnegation people because they were trying to find Tris because shes the Divergent person and she was hiding so her parents basically had to risk her life for her.

Getting to the point though, there is a lady who controls everyone and everything and she is the one still looking for Tris and Four because Four is also half Divergent. So Tris and Four have to go through a lot of things and risk their lives almost to find the lady to wants Tris, they end up finding her but the rest is a mystery! Youll have to see for yourself.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie if you absolutely love dystopia movies because I know I do! Also if you don't want to watch it you're in luck again because there is also a book of the whole Divergent series and I recommend reading it too, I haven't read it before though. Well I hope you get to watch this movie or read the book sometime thanks!",1449792000,,1687,4.309148264984227

6099699,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I loved the book and I enjoyed the movie (even though it misses out on a lot of the details).

This movie plays out like a lot of movies in its category. The lead character in a different world from our own is forced to make decisions about her future at a young age and finds that her choices lead her to unexpected truths about the world. Add in the love interest, the friends, the tension and the strong plot and it is a great product. I absolutely fell in love with the book and enjoyed the movie as well. The acting is great and I just love the premise of being forced to choose a trait that I am supposed to belong in. After watching the movie, my friends and I had long conversations about what factions we would belong in and found that each of us seemed to find a fit with our personality traits. It is an amazing movie that is totally worth watching.",1449187200,,860,4.149700598802395

6099701,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Originally saw this movie on opening night in the theaters, and haven't watched it since, until now. I still love it so much. Often it is criticized for being ""too much like The Hunger Games,"" but that's just not true. Although they both involve a dystopian plot, that does not make them the same. Differences include: basic plot, factions (based on a person's ""inner self"" and beliefs) vs districts (based on a person's birth and job), the overall objective of the main characters, etc.",1449187200,,487,4.809523809523809

6099716,4,B00GQQ77IU,Divergent felt like a coming of age movie. The main character has the ability to choose any path she wants in life and chooses the group that least fits her and becomes accepted through hard work.

6099722,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is a great film because it has a balance of action, romance, suspense, and the story line really makes you think ""what if?"".

I gave this film 4 stars because the actors did a very fine job and the story line stayed as true to the book as the Big Screen can.  Kate Winslet and Miles Teller are brilliant, Shailene Woodley was a good fit for Beatrice Prior, and Theo James...he is a skilled actor and so easy on the eyes!  The special effects were also done very well.",1449100800,,477,4.277777777777778
6099723,5,B00GQQ77IU,"It appeals to exactly the audience the studio had hoped. That would be young people and their youthful parents. It is an action film based in possible reality if only our lives were governed by a different set of leadership values. In this instance, young people have to test to learn which walk of life they have to pursue when they come of age. This story is basically about what happens when you are not a fit for anything. It's exciting. It's fast moving. It has a good plot. I think it was enjoyable.",1449100800,,505,4.382978723404255

The premise was amazing and intriguing, the plot was very similar to a lot of post apocolyptic scenarios but was well put together.  The character development moved very well and I was impressed with the quickness of the story as it progressed.  The main character seemed likable but also seems very distant from the audience as she sometimes seems disinterested in what she is doing.  I like how her search is growing and she seems to know what she wants still has that ""lost"" feel to her as she moved along in the story.  Overall, I was very impressed by the movie and the cinematography as well.  I really liked this movie and can't wait for the remaining to play out to see what transpires.",1449014400,,824,4.46

6099821,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Love the book and the movie, but Inwish they had kept closer to the book. I'm confused as to why the took out Edward's character, he was really interesting and plays a roll in the other books. And am disappointed that they took out Tris's rape scene and made it an attack instead. There was a real opportunity to try to eradicate the US rape culture by having a heroine who defeated her rapists and refused to be a victim. I loved everything else tho, the casting and acting was phenomenal! Especially since I went in HATING Shaline and now I LOVE her and think she makes the PERFECT Tris!!!!",1449014400,,592,4.390909090909091

6099900,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Coming from a Guy, I would say that this movie delivers for those who are either forced to see it with their female companion or for a channel flipper who is just looking for something that is on. The story is very rich and the acting is believable enough to feel like the events are really happening. Reminds me of a certain other book-to-film series... It does have thrills and action for the guys, but is a little too long and full of dialogue for me. As a movie fan, I learned that a lengthy movie can cause the audience to lose attention and this is exactly what happened to me as I watched the movie in theaters. To the producer's credit, all book-to-film movies are long and winded and most people will take a compelling story with well directed scenes over length any day. I was tossing back and forth from 4 star to 5 on this one, but after watching it on Amazon versus seeing it in theaters, I quickly brought it to the 5th star. The Quality of movies on instant video is Amazing. I will grabbing the sequel at some point and see where the story goes.",1448841600,,1061,4.2835820895522385

6099908,3,B00GQQ77IU,"As many others have said, if you've seen the Hunger Games or any other YA dystopia sci-fi made in the last decade, this will be basically more of the same.
The story was presented too simply, with the only questions it leaves being due to its inability to properly set up its world, but acts like there's something deeper. The characters are hardly fleshed out, being sort of generic character types for most of the movie, until the screenwriters realized there needed to be character development and suddenly thrust tons of development into one or two scenes. The character relationships are not believable or even attempted to be. They're just suddenly in love one scene. The story attempts plot twists, but for anyone paying attention to any movie in the past decade will be able to figure all of it out before the movie wants you to. The villain comes out of nowhere, given two short scenes before she becomes the big bad, and has no development to lead to a believable villain. The final confrontation with the villain comes out of nowhere, suddenly the love interest tells main character of this thing happening, then they're all being mind controlled by a macguffin that comes out of nowhere, then they have to get guns and save the day.
There was nothing great in the movie, nothing wholly original or fantastic. There's one scene where Shailene Woodley acts, after seeing someone she cares about die. It was the one scene in the movie that anyone felt like they were acting, but she was really good in it, and made me realize that she is actually an actress and not just a cute young face. The fact that Loscil had some music in the movie was pretty great, too, since that dude is great and needs to be represented more.
There was also nothing offensive in the movie. Nothing in it was so bad I felt insulted, or so bad that I felt the story was trying to rip off better YA stories.
I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't tell people to avoid it. If I had paid any money for this (got it free with the Amazon Thanksgiving thing) I might care a bit more, but for now, Divergent is just kind of... there.",1448668800,,2112,4.502604166666667

For reasons that become clear later in the film, ""Four,"" is a just a nickname, but for Tris, it becomes something that saves her very life at a crucial point later on in the film.

Loved the first book and only picked it up because my wife and I met in Chicago.  Granted, each successive movie was less engaging and now they are just outright boring (hell the third book took nearly 2/3 of the book to get to any plot line that didn't revolve around ""ooo, I love him/her, and ooo I'm pining for them"").  This, at least, was a pretty good video.  Never mind I feel I can't look at Shalene Woodley straight in the eyes with that lazy eye thing going on, but Four is pretty much how I imagined him as were most of the other characters.  Solid acting (except for hers) and believable emotions.  Can't complain with a free download because of some Verizon promo.",1448409600,,800,4.482758620689655

I tried watching it on the recommendation of a friend who thought I'd love it because I enjoy films that depict post-apocalyptic scenarios. I really wish I would have read through some of the critical reviews before taking her recommendation at face value! For starters, the whole faction thing is completely unrealistic to the point that it can't be taken seriously. The cheese factor and immature emotional overtones are out of control. I stopped watching after what's-her-face chose to join the Dauntless faction and they all bust out of the Choosing Ceremony jumping and smiling and running down the street like a scene straight out of West Side Story. If you're not a pre-pubescent girl, you might ought to think twice about wasting $6 and 2 hours on this.

It's worth noting that I thought The Hunger Games was quite good even though it was written for a younger audience, so I'm not judging on that basis alone.",1448150400,,1036,4.6923076923076925

Of course, you can never really capture ALL the nuances of a book, which is why I say read the series first.

Wonderfully exciting, thrilling ride to the very end!  The casting is spot on - the story is almost identical to the book;  I can't imagine anyone who read the book being disappointed with this movie.  I've watched it several times and it's just as stimulating as the first time!
If anything, I think the movie tweaked some scenes, brace yourself, for the better *gasp* *ohmahgawdnoshediint*

For example, the breathtaking zip line scene and the scene where Christina gets punished.

The casting was great, the movie was spectacular. All in all, I was more than pleased and would recommend this movie to anyone who read the book or anyone who didn't read the books but wants an action packed, thrilling movie with a little bit of romance thrown into the mix!

6100018,2,B00GQQ77IU,"It's not really a good movie and it's not anywhere near the book.  It's just sort of meh.
They decided to ""save"" some time and assume that everyone who was even considering to watch this had already read the book, gotten Veronica Roth mania and right away bought the dvd for the movie.  I feel like without reading the book first anyone who tries to watch this movie will be completely lost as far as figuring out what's going on.  Therefore this movie fails to tell a story anywhere near the quality of the book.  Or any story at all.  The book has a very grounded feel to it, and that is thanks to it being told from Tris's pov.  It relies on that point of view so much, that without knowing Tris's thoughts about everything and how she sees things, it just falls apart.  And all of the important plot points that help to shape Tris's journey, are turned into a handful of random unimportant events that contribute nothing to the story.  Tris's friends aren't really all that important either, Tris needed her friends to help her get through becoming Dauntless, but here she feels like she's already become brave and she's already who she needs to be.  She doesn't need anyone else.  The zip lining scene is still awesome!!!  It's by far the best part of the movie.  Tris and Four's relationship doesn't have any character to it, everything that made it happen was removed, here they don't seem to have any chemistry, much less be able to fall in love.  And the worst thing of all, my favorite part of the book, the scene where in the dorm Edward gets stabbed in the eye, is not in the movie.  I was disappointed about that.  It's very jumbled and not very coherent.  This story does not translate well to film.",1444521600,,1713,4.4423076923076925

6100091,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This is a trilogy by Veronica Roth. It is not in the same vein as the Hunger Games trilogy but remains quite close. It is a science fiction film that is set in a futuristic community after wars have destroyed most of the world population. In this film, societies are divided into five separate factions, representing different virtues. At 18, children have to decide their particular faction based on a test that highlights their inclinations and they have to choose a faction for the remainder of their lives. The protagonist, Beatrice (Tris) Prior has to make a her choice that surprises everyone. This is a good thriller, not as good as Hunger Games,set in a place where people have to pick factions before blood.  Tris is warned that she is a divergent, meaning that she does not fit into any slot. Along with Four, a character from the Dauntless faction, she has to unearth a conspiracy by Jeanine (Kate Winslet) to eliminate all divergents. Tris has to understand what makes divergents so dangerous. The character development has been handled well by Director Neil Burger. Good performances by Shailene Woodley as Tris and Kate Winslet.",1440979200,,1142,4.88659793814433

6100128,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I enjoyed this movie. It had an interesting premise and the acting was good in the film. We all know that people have different personalities and the logic to sort people out into groups after a catastrophic war shows what extremes society may consider to prevent another war. I wondered where the group of people prone to violence and total disrespect of any control were. The divergents were part of that personality but they still exhibited humanity in their personalities.

Ultimately the plot exposed that like most governmental controlled concepts it really is manipulated to have some group have all of the power. Greed and control always are part of the human mentality of some people.

While I liked the movie I wondered why no one left the confines of the city. What was the world like outside of the wall. It was a good story but the holes in the story bugged me. The film was obviously set up for sequels so perhaps some of the questions will be answered in the future. I obviously hav... Read more",1439769600,,1010,4.636871508379889

6100154,3,B00GQQ77IU,"I liked the premise and the action. I didn't go for five stars for two reasons, one plot driven and one probably petty.
One: the movie seemed to take a long time building up to the action. It was clearly going to be a series because so much time was spent on how society was set up and how the characters ended up in the guilds they did. There were moments when I was sitting forward in the seat urging the characters to get busy and do something.
Two: come on; it's an action movie. How many girls in life-and-death struggles can run a hand through their hair and have it fall into perfection? And keep flipping that hair into perfection? She has functional hair until the hero shows up and then all of a sudden it's flowing and every hair in place. And I guess the makeup must be hardcore waterproof because it seems like most girls would be either a) smart enough not to wear makeup to a battle or b) sweating it off in rivulets while they jump from trains and climb tall buildings.
But if you're not petty like me, or can look past petty, the movie was fun to watch. Not sure I'd watch it a second time, but it wasn't a waste of time.",1439251200,,1138,4.177272727272728

The movie takes itself kinda seriously... it's an obvious knock-off of Hunger Games and stars an obvious knock-off of J-Law to really send it home. It makes some nice points about conformity and stereotypes in a sledge-hammer style that makes it easy for 12-year old's to understand. I don't knock it for that. They're playing to that demographic and it pretty much works for what it is. Not much subtlety on any level but it's reasonably entertaining.

6100259,3,B00GQQ77IU,"While browsing movies on Amazon, I found this four-star rated sci-fi film and dove in.  While the premise was nothing original - people being assigned to a certain class (or faction) based on their naturally-occurring characteristics and talents - the movie kept my attention for the first 20-minutes or so.  However, as characters failed to develop, different factions demonstrated over-the-top stereotypical behavior, and young love blossomed, I started to think to myself, ""Is this a teen movie?""  After the conclusion of the film I googled ""Divergent"" and learned that, sure enough, it is.

I can't fault the film for being oriented towards teens.  However, when compared to the other recent big Sci-Fi teen film - The Hunger Games - Divergent doesn't compare.  Hunger Games takes the concept of pre-determined destiny in an original direction with the Districts, while Divergent seems like something out of an old Twilight Zone.  As an adult, the originality of the The Hunger Games, the uniqueness of the universe, and the quality of the acting has intrigued me enough to return to the movies several times; once is enough for Divergent.

Though I have never watched any of the Twilight films, I suspect that Divergent is closer to these than The Hunger Games.  In summary, I imagine the movie appeals to many teens, but if you are an adult looking for something to keep your attention for 2 hours, you'll want to look elsewhere.",1437264000,4,1435,4.995798319327731

6100307,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Good story, poor execution. I loved Limitless but Burger's directing is just a poor fit here. Really disappointed because the books were bad enough that the opportunity for improving on them had so much potential. The script is obviously weak and I think too much attention was given to things that don't matter at the cost of things that could have made the movie stronger. I love Shailene Woodley and Theo James in these roles though, by far they are the draw of this movie, and James' acting nuances really steal the show.",1435622400,,525,4.655913978494624

It is a combination of action and sci-fi rolled in one.  It has a very creative story line on a socialist society and shows how there will always be a group that will not conform, can not conform and will not conform.  Shows how we all must choose our own path, but we are responsible for these choices. I liked how it showed that based on these choices you left your previous life behind, no belongings, and no contact with anyone from you past. Many of us sometimes wish this could happen in our own lives.  If you love scifi and a great original story try this one. Can't wait for the sequel!",1435449600,,758,4.236111111111111

The plucky young girl/boy in a dystopian future finding an unconventional way to break the mold and save the community from the ""big bad"" while discovering adventure and true love along the way. However, Divergent the movie just didn't live up to other offerings in the genre. It was very colorless in both literal color and dialogue. Some of the acting was stiff even from the experienced supporting cast. The pacing was unnecessarily slow and drawn out - the entire movie was about 45 minutes too long. Watching at home on streaming we made a snack and let the dogs in & out without pausing the movie and were able to step back in without missing a single key plot element. Hunger Games and others are lively, action filled, and colorful with excellent acting throughout - Divergent just doesn't live up to the standard.",1432771200,5,910,4.588957055214724

I thought this movie, for the most part, was an excellent adaption of the book and the movie itself I thought was very good. The acting was good to great and I especially liked Woodley's performance as Tris and Winslet's performance as Jeanine Matthews. My only complaints are that they didn't include the scene where Peter stabs Edward in the eye which was in the book and that Al's character didn't get as much attention. In the book there was much more focus on Al's character and the build-up to his suicide which they did include in the movie. And Jeanine getting attacked and knocked out by Tris didn't happen at all in the book and that's what happened near the end of the movie. I know it seems like I'm criticizing it a lot but those are really just minor complaints. Other than that I thought the movie was great and I totally do not agree with all the Critics' review on this. Yes Divergent has a few similarities but they are really two completely different stories and personally I think I enjoyed divergent more than Hunger Games. 5 stars.",1432512000,,1203,4.3991031390134525

I have noticed many negative reviews. The only thing I can conclude is they must have read the book first before seeing the movie. The movie cannot possibly capture the details in a book. I feel - in most cases - the book is always better.

The acting by all of the cast was outstanding and very believable.

What starts out to appear a very sedative beginning increases steadily into a very surprising, action-filled movie! The viewer is on the edge of his/her seat the majority of the time.

It is, sadly, very realistic. It is the direction our society is going if the population does not ""wise up"" and stop this direction through supporting those politically who will turn the governing forces back to democracy and freedom.

This is rated PG-13 for violence.

To me the story of a dystopian future is not nearly as appealing to me as that of a utopian future, but it is what it is, and the movie does track the book pretty well.  If you're into the good individual vs control-freak government struggle, without a lot of blood and gore, you will enjoy this flick.  The actors all did a great job, and if you have read the book, you will enjoy the well done imaging that enhances the storyline found in the book.",1431388800,,784,4.393103448275862

6100465,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is a somber, slow-paced post-apocalyptic teen adventure with an absolutely ridiculous premise.  In this world, all people are divided into five ""factions"" based on specific personality traits:  Abnegation (for the selfless), Candor (for the truthful), Amity (for the compassionate), Dauntless (for the brave), and Erudite (for the intelligent).  The suggestion is that by dividing its populace into these five separate groups, and by drilling into them the mantra ""Faction Over Blood,"" the government can control everyone.  Anyone who can't cut it in their chosen faction is tossed out into the street to live as ""factionless,"" basically meaning homeless vagabonds who huddle around burning barrels in dirty clothes.  And those rare individuals who fit into more than one of the five factions (imagine that, someone who might actually be intelligent, brave, and compassionate all at the same time!) is labeled ""Divergent,"" and becomes an enemy of the state, since they can't be controlled.  Ha!

The story is told from the perspective of sixteen-year-old Tris, who was born into Abnegation and now must choose whether to stay with her parents' faction or choose one of the others.  Psychological tests are administered to the teens before the ""Choosing Ceremony"" to help them make a wise choice, but Tris's tests are inconclusive - she's Divergent, a label she's advised to keep secret lest she be targeted for extermination.  So she wavers between following her parents' lead (and spending her life selflessly helping others and never looking in the mirror), or joining the Dauntless faction (where she can jump out of speeding trains, climb to the top of humongous scaffolds, and practice hand-to-hand combat in the Pit).  It's no big surprise which one Tris chooses.

But why is she given a choice at all?  If this society is so set on keeping its citizens locked up in separate factions, surely the tests would reveal which faction is right for each person.  Why give them a choice?  Because just about any sixteen-year-old kid is going to choose something fun (like Dauntless) rather than something rooted in self-denial (i.e. Abnegation)!  It makes no sense.  In The Giver (which also divides its people into groups - but groups based on aptitude), there is no choice.  In Brave New World (which also has five factions, although they aren't called that), the people are genetically bred to fit into designated castes.  In the case of Divergent, the groups seem random and purposeless, especially since the kids can pick whichever one they want regardless of the results of their psychological tests.  And what ultimately happens reveals how random and purposeless it all is.

Since all of the leaders of this society come from the Abnegation faction (since they are supposedly selfless, and thus won't ever be greedy or power-hungry), it's not surprising that the other factions might start questioning whether this is quite fair.  And it's also no surprise that it's Erudite that challenges things first - after all, they're the intelligent ones, right?  They'd be the first to wonder why a bunch of selfless sheep are running things when there are smart people out there who can do it better.  And they can do it better with an army of brave Dauntless behind them, an army they've figured out how to control (since the Erudite are the only ones in this society with any brains!).

Which leaves Tris in a sticky situation.  She's a member of Dauntless, but she's really Divergent.  That means she can't be controlled in the same way the rest of the Dauntless are.  And it also means she can see what's coming, because she's got a little bit of Erudite in her.  And she feels bad for her parents (because she's got a little bit of Amity, too).  And she wants to help people (she was born in Abnegation, after all!).  It's just lucky she's not a full-fledged Candor, or she'd be blabbing all of this to everyone she sees!

Ultimately, the movie is about Tris's efforts to make it in Dauntless (think Ender's Game), her discovery of an insidious plot that needs to be resisted (think Hunger Games), and her growing love for eighteen-year-old Four, another secret Divergent who's hiding out in Dauntless (think any teen romance between star-crossed lovers).  Had the premise made any kind of sense, this might have been a watchable, if somewhat slow, science fiction adventure.  But it doesn't.  It's impossible to be any one of the five factions in this film without also possessing elements of the other four - that's just what being human means.  Some of us are more intelligent than others, braver than others, or more compassionate and selfless - but what good is a selfless leader without the ability to reason?  And what good is a brave soldier without compassion, intelligence, and a willingness to help others?  You can't ""protect and serve"" if you couldn't care less about those you're protecting and serving!  No, the premise is flawed.  And what remains is a rather tame YA sci-fi story that never quite rises to the level of a really good film.",1430956800,,5070,4.955029585798816

6100474,1,B00GQQ77IU,"To keep it short, the wife bought this and I watched it with her since I know she enjoys the books. The discs and features all work well enough, but I strongly disliked the story and set pieces. You've seen the film and you know what happens, it's a dystopian teen drama flick and it seems pretty poorly slapped together; the acting isn't terribly good and the young people on set don't really add much to the film other than add to the pervading sense that there aren't enough rational adults around.

*SPOILERS* There aren't enough rational thinking people around b/c the whole town is a big setup designed (and I **** you not) to see when all the people will stop being mentally handicapped. Yes, everyone in this film (unbeknownst to the audience) is mentally handicapped and not able to have more than a few personality traits. What the royal F is this?? Somehow this is supposed to make sense b/c radiation made everyone dumb  i.e. they don't have human personalities but the film never mentions any of this. *SPOILERS*

This movie is HUGE cash in by Hollywood executives searching for another big Hunger Games pay out and it wouldnt be so ham-fisted and obvious if the movie (and book I presume) weren't themselves hanging from the teat of the Hunger Games. Look Im not a huge HG fan but they worked and were at least something new to the Hollywood scene. Bad acting, bad plot, and poor adaptation do not a good movie make.

6100495,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Hello, I'm the Ranting Usher.  Let me talk you to your seat.
  In this sci-fi action film that is the first installment in a series based on the novel by Veronica Roth, society is divided into five factions which it's citizens must choose to conform to.
  The main character, Tris Pryor, carries a deep secret that, if exposed, could get her killed.  The more she struggles to keep her secret, the more she is physically and emotionally challenged within her chosen faction.  What I like most about Divergent is that, despite borrowing tropes from other classics, it delivers a riveting tale of survival.  It maintains themes of self-actualization and control while creating engaging character development, and builds tension and suspense that will keep you watching from beginning to end.  It's hard to take your eyes off this film.

6100498,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I had avoided this series based on some early reviews that claimed it was no more than a Hunger Games clone. Wrong! There are some similarities in the premiss, but Divergent can stand on its own and is worth viewing. Good effects, decent acting and an interesting plot make for a film to view. I'm looking forward to the rst of the series and have added the books to my reading list.",1430265600,,383,4.333333333333333
6100499,5,B00GQQ77IU,Divergent is a complex adventurous movie. It is about the coming of age and finding your true self. It shows strength and relationships that are bonded. The best part is the actors and actresses. They do an AMAZING job with telling the story and portraying the characters. Also Shailene Woodley is a beautiful and talented actress! And Theo James is one hot hunk!,1430265600,,363,4.777777777777778

6100504,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I was asked to review ""Divergent"" and watched it half-heartedly, having been told it ""is a lame ripoff of 'Hunger Games'.""  I learned a valuable lesson - make up your own mind - because ""Divergent"" won me over in the first ten minutes.  I can't wait to read the novel!

""Divergent"" may have been targeted to the Young Adult genre, but ANYONE of ANY age, can appreciate its messages of morality, dangers of pigeon-holing of personalities, appreciating those who are different, the pain of moral choices, and its rich fantasy world in futuristic Chicago.  It's a fabulous coming-of-age story, as Tris learns who she is, develops her moral code and makes often painful moral choices.  There are SO many levels to this movie!  Any sci-fi, fantasy, and post-apocalyptic story fan can appreciate ""Divergent.""

Shailene Woodley is a fabulous actress who gives depth to her young character.  Her romance with darkly-handsome and mysterious Four is believable and I can't wait to see both characters continue to develop. It's wonderful to see a movie give an age-accurate portrayal of teens and teen romance; so many screenwriters (who are of course adults) make kids act either too old or too young for their actual depicted ages.  Zoe Kravitz proves herself as talented as her famous rockstar dad, and I look forward to seeing more work from Jai Courtney and Miles Teller, too.

The special effects are awesome. I've never been a fan of CG effects, which make many movies look more like a cartoon or an XBox game than a live-action movie.  ""Divergent"" takes state of the art to its fullest, and futuristic Chicago looks real and gritty.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""Divergent"" and can't say enough good things about its actors, storyline and technical achievement.  I will be purchasing and reading the novels, and eagerly await the next installment in this trilogy.",1430092800,,1853,4.957928802588997

My bet is that if you read the books, you might like the movies more than on the movies alone. So much potential, but it lapses into focusing on the devices and themes we've seen too often in recent films out lately, making it look and feel trite. While watching it, the scenes and dialogue kept me thinking ""Matrix meets Hunger Games"" until the movie had no identity of its own.",1428364800,,534,4.404040404040404

I like that I can redeem the digital copy on iTunes and have it with me on my iPad while traveling (if I want).

6100630,3,B00GQQ77IU,"If you like the Hunger Games, Maze Runner or Harry Potter, you'll like Divergent. For me and my wife it's just OK but for our 20 year old daughter it was great.

Divergent, based on a trilogy of books by Veronica Roth and follows an all too familiar tween movie formula ... young, innocent, compassionate, female teen who doesn't quite fit into society's and is faced with an event (in Divergent's case ""The Test"") after which the teen must quickly grow up, discover themselves and their special skills, lose their innocence and ultimately become a strong willed heroine who saves the day.

Of course along the way our heroine is tormented by others around her for being weak as she constantly struggles with herself to do the right thing. Then there's the inevitable romance which starts out with uncertainty, then transitions into awkwardness (does he like me?) and eventually turns into a mutual attraction between a sexy girl and hunky guy ... who knew that would happen?

Yes Divergent is a formula movie ... the story is old and the plot is predictable but that doesn't make it bad.

Divergent probably won't win any Oscars, but the story is entertaining and the acting and cinematography are good.

Overall Divergent is worth watching, I'm just not sure it's worth buying. I'd recommend renting this one.",1427846400,5,1311,4.834821428571429

6100663,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent (2014) is a thrilling, dystopian, action movie based on a book of the same title by author Veronica Roth. The book series is simply called Divergent as well, and consists of three main books, Divergent, Insurgent, and Allegiant; plus an additional few short stories.

  So, in the movie Divergent (2014), we meet Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl who lives amidst a precarious faction system within the walls of a great city safely cut off from the ruins of what once was America. The factions are Erudite, the knowledgeable ones; Amity, the peaceful crop-tenders; Candor, the honest; Dauntless, the brave protectors; and Abnegation, the selfless. Beatrice's parents are part of Abnegation, which makes Beatrice, and her brother Caleb, part of it too. Until they get the test and choose a faction at the choosing ceremony. The test tells teens what they're most like (it helps them choose right at the choosing ceremony). ...But to some, like Beatrice, it tells something entirely different. Some dangerous. A condition punishable by death.

  This film brings us along with Beatrice as she struggles to cope with being divergent, and live in spite of it. After joining a new faction, she begins to realize that some things are very wrong with the way her city is living, and she has to decide whether to stay undercover, or take a stand.

  First off, I found Divergent (2014) to be thoroughly entertaining; interesting and captivating. The whole dystopian thing has really captured my attention of late, and that element of this movie doesn't disappoint.
  We have the strange faction system. Crumbling, abandoned ships and skyscrapers. Fascinating concoctions that stimulate the part in a person's brain that processes fear... when is injected into a person, along with little things that allow your fearful hallucinations to be seen on a computer screen. Yeah, crazy technology or something. :P But it's very interesting to think of.

  There's a strong family theme. It's easy to see that Beatrice and her brother and parents love each other. In some cases, this love is shown as certain ones put their life on the line for others. There's hugs exchanged, I love yous spoken, and sacrifices made.

  No spiritual element to speak of since Divergent (2014) isn't a Christian movie (or book). I read somewhere that Veronica Roth is a Christian, so... I don't know. *Shrugs* Some good values are still captured in this film though, such as standing up for the innocent even when it'll hurt (even kill) you, and putting friends and family above yourself as well. There's lots of shooting and deaths, especially in the latter part of the movie, but I didn't feel those parts were too glorified; and there were several scenes of characters grieving over someone's death. It's seems evident that Tris (Beatrice) is shocked, horrified, regretful over all the deaths, and the fighting she herself has to do. You can see it in her eyes and a scene where she says she's not sure she knows who she is anymore.

  That all being said, I will still note that some of the violence creeped me out. There were smaller things, such as the fighting rounds during Dauntless training, that didn't creep me out, but it wasn't too fun to watch, I'll admit. There were at least four intense fighting scenes, (girl on girl and boy on girl) in which one of the pair gets beat up pretty bad. There's punching in the face and stomach, some shoving and kicking and whatnot. The part that creeped me out really though, was when the fighting with guns/fighting against the government started in earnest... armed men are chasing a teenage girl, and loved ones start to die. I got over it after awhile, but it definitely made me stop and go, wait, this isn't a pg, fluffy romance or anything. So yeah, stop and realize this is pg-13 for intense violence before letting any younger children watch it. I would say viewers should be at least 13, preferably older (16 or so and up). If not because of the violence, then because there's definitely some mature themes that younger children and maybe even some teens can't really grasp.

  Such as intense competition between the Dauntless, which results in a suicide. And some of the stuff the Dauntless leadership try to teach their trainees, like obeying even when you don't agree with what's being done, or are even horrified at what's being done.

  Divergent (2014) was really interesting that way. It made me think of how some leaders/rulers really try to manipulate their people, as the society/dauntless leadership were trying to do in this film. ""Human nature is the enemy,"" says one of the leaders, Jeanine Matthews... (which is true in a sense because it IS human nature to sin, to be selfish, to protect yourself even when it hurts others, to seek pleasure at any cost, and so on.) But the society's solution to human nature being the enemy, was to wipe out free will, wipe out thinking independently, wipe out emotions, wipe out the tie between family members. Faction before blood! is their quote. So yeah, its an interesting, thought-provoking theme overall.

  The romance of Divergent (2014) was touching and heartfelt at points. A little too much at other points. There's an extended kissing scene as well as a few other little moments that perhaps didn't need to be added. Also, there's a brief hallucination of a girl getting attacked. Some immodest dress and inappropriate comments also are downs of this movie.

  And there's some swearing. Some misuse of God's name. Perhaps four or five of each throughout the film.

  In conclusion, I'm not really sure what to think of Divergent (2014) yet. Like I said, it entertained me. The dystopian world fascinated me. For the most part, Tris had a sweet romance. There were no really twisted ideals being promoted that I can see as of now. But there were still teens pummeling each other, and lots of shooting. The end of Divergent (2014) leaves me really wanting to watch Insurgent (2015)...but, we'll see.

  For the most part, the dystopian world, the action, the crazy stunts, the intriguing story of Divergent (2014) really pulled me in. It's a thrilling watch in that aspect! :)

6100683,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I am not a fan of the YA genre in general. But I decided to give this a try since I found the Hunger Games: Catching Fire surprisingly intelligent and well-done. Unfortunately, this film was disappointing. More so because the premise and the acting was good. But the screenplay and directing ruined it. There was no exploration of why Tris chose to leave Abnegation or how she felt about leaving her family forever. Did she just want to be with the ""cool"" kids? Who knows. In fact, Tris' motivation throughout the movie was ambiguous if non-existent. The film never gained a consistent tone. When the Dauntless crew began whooping and leaping through the streets I swear all I could think of was West Side Story. I expected song and dance at any moment. Then they turn into bullies and psychopaths, more stupid than brave. And after 100 years, you think they would repair some buildings. Seems like they needed a construction faction. The romance part was also too predictable and lacked the subtlety found in the Hunger Games. It should be a backstory, not THE story. The sheer oppression of being told exactly who or what you were going to be should have been the tone of the whole movie, yet it never even gets explored. A perfect example of how a poor screenplay and directing can ruin a film even if the premise is there and the acting is decent.",1427241600,,1351,4.609958506224066

6100706,1,B00GQQ77IU,"Vampires are out and the new  literary-industrial book-to-movie-to-t-shirt product is dystopia.  Unfortunately Divergent is more of a mash-up than a movie.  The choosing of classes is a bit like the reaping of the Hunger Games and a bit like Harry Potter choosing a frat via the magic hat.  The Dauntless caste that she joins seems more like a gang from West Side Story than an army as it trains for no obvious purpose by running around the city doing parkour. The nadir of this pandering film comes when one of the teens ( everyone is a teen) exclaims ""let's get tattoos!"" thus checking all of the boxes of what the target demographic might want.",1426896000,15,647,4.649122807017544

I was a huge ""Hunger Games"" fan, but feel that divergent is a lot better. The story-line is well written, keeps you on the edge of your seat and Shailene Woodley plays an excellent part.

Shailene Woodley really turned in a good performance for a relative newcomer to the large and small screens. The story line has some interesting twists and keeps the violence down to an acceptable minimum while still telling an interesting story about the choices we must make when we are young and the classic corruption and ambition of those who think that because they are highly educated, they know what is best for all. The movie is long but keeps you interested right up until the end. A good Saturday night movie.",1426636800,,619,4.7407407407407405

And what about the shopkeepers, lunch counter workers, taxi drivers - is there a group for them, or are grocery stores and such just a thing of the past? And how many of these stories about unexceptional teenage girls saving the world do we have to stomach before this brand of entertainment plays out? And just as a matter of curiosity, what possible purpose can a faction of people with ""candor"" serve, especially since the smart folk have a faction all their own?

If im rating the movie, it is 5 stars, but if im rating it compared to the book, well, i would give it a 1. the book is so much more in depth, like all books are, but there also a whole lot more of Tris and Four in the book which would have been nice to see in the movie. The movie doesnt compare to the book, but what movies do? As a whole the movie is intense, pleasurable, exciting, shocking, and beautiful. The actors are great and the sets are just like i pictured. I fell in love with the divergent series by watching the movie and as long as i don't think about the book i only get a little mad at the screenwriters and directors and producers that made this movie different from the great book that it is based off of",1425340800,,843,3.935672514619883

The acting was very good. The story was interesting. Keep in mind this is part 1 of a planned trilogy. So this is not a complete story. It does not get all nicely wrapped up at the end. Divergent is basically just exposition to the rest of the story.",1424995200,,319,4.145161290322581

Although this happens to many movies, Sci-fi seems especially susceptible to this.  A lot more of this should've been left on the cutting room floor.

Bottom line:  Falls apart and drags on.  Pass it by.",1424908800,,346,5.089285714285714

Decent movie that offended me through and through with their commercials trying to make it look like this was a supernatural/superhero-type movie but it's really just an action/drama and the implication of special abilities/powers/etc. doesn't get conclusively shut down until about the end of the movie.

If they had just promoted it as what it is, a thoughtful action drama with a sci-fi setting I'd have given it probably 3-4 stars.  But I don't accept being misled.",1423785600,4,480,5.128205128205129

6100931,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I enjoyed this very much. I miss a little more of an involved plot for the more serious minded yet the acting is very good from all concerned. The background, layouts in the scenes are interesting from a bleak point of view. Unfortunately the script in my opinion would have been a whole lot better where it to explain HOW the folks survived- from grouping to grouping. I would very much so have enjoyed learning more about the divisions of the groups. There could be a sequel and I would watch one should there be one made.

The acting is very good from all the cast members- great and small and the co-stars manage to carry scenes very well.

An original tale- five stars for this.

For instance- where are these folks coming up with hair dye, fancy make-up and fancy clothing? Nice designer wear clothing in an aftermath of a war? Why are those who are supposed to value virtue and modesty wearing make-up? Would have lent a lot more to the film if the star females were NOT wearing make-up nor had highlights in their hair. The acting however made up for a few of these flaws.",1423440000,,1080,4.417085427135678

6100963,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I would like to begin my review of this book with an analogy. (Mild spoilers)

You meet this girl that you are immediately attracted to. Like instant love, movie sort of stuff. You ask her out and amazingly enough she agrees. You really want to impress her, so you get reservations at one of the finest restaurants in town. You go all out (i.e. get a tux, rent a limo, etc.). You pick her up. The date goes great. You think she may be the one, and she seems really into you. Finally, at the end of the night you walk her to her door to kiss her goodnight, at which point she pushes you away and says ""I had a lot of fun, but I just want to be friends.""

This movie left me as unfulfilled as this scenario. I've never read the books, but I went into the movie with a certain level of excitement. I mean the hype for it was insane. But the movie itself was just...empty. Admittedly I found the whole premise of the story absurd, but that's really the least of my issues. All of the plot elements had either already been done before (Harry Potter's hat choosing ceremony anyone?), were poorly explained (so the security force that's supposed to protect everyone acts like a bunch of monkeys?), or just made no sense at all (so he's not affected at one point, but then he's suddenly affected when the plot demands it?). The only good parts were the pseudo-Matrix scenes, and they really didn't fit with the story at all. Perhaps the story would have made more sense if I'd read the books. Maybe some things would be explained better, but I doubt it. As it stands, I have zero desire to see the next one.

On the plus side, my 15 year old daughter loved it (LOOOOOOOVED IT!!!1!!1). I guess that explains the high ratings.",1422576000,,1716,4.3229813664596275

6101010,4,B00GQQ77IU,"I enjoyed this movie. It had an interesting premise and the acting was good in the film. We all know that people have different personalities and the logic to sort people out into groups after a catastrophic war shows what extremes society may consider to prevent another war. I wondered where the group of people prone to violence and total disrespect of any control were. The divergents were part of that personality but they still exhibited humanity in their personalities.

Ultimately the plot exposed that like most governmental controlled concepts it really is manipulated to have some group have all of the power. Greed and control always are part of the human mentality of some people.

While I liked the movie I wondered why no one left the confines of the city. What was the world like outside of the wall. It was a good story but the holes in the story bugged me. The film was obviously set up for sequels so perhaps some of the questions will be answered in the future. I obviously have not read the book and now that my interest has been peaked I will have to get it to read.

I'm okay with a story based on a future society and with a young person's perspective on it. That's all fine. But the actions of the characters too frequently made no sense. The motivations of the characters were illogical. The whole story was simply off kilter. What I would call Fluff entertainment. Check your brain at the door and don't think too hard about what's going on. The dots don't connect. I can see where the movie would be big with the Justin Bieber teeny bopper crowd and that's great.

6101025,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Let me start off by saying that in my experience, it is very difficult for me to like a movie based on a book that I've already read.  I have too many expectations of what the movie should be.  (Anyone remember Eragon?  Super horrible!)

The movie felt rushed and I feel it may have been difficult to understand exactly what was going on if I hadn't read the book.  But that's normal for book adaptations.

That being said, it was still a decent movie.  It is exciting seeing a book come to life, even if I don't agree with everything they did.  There was some cool scenes and I thought the acting was good.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.

I'd just like to comment on one specific aspect of the movie that I remember.  (It was a couple months ago that I watched it)

SPOILER ALERT:

I thought that the two scenes in which Tris' parents die were poorly done.  In both cases the book makes it clear that they died to save Tris.  If memory serves, the mother holds some guys off from Tris and is overwhelmed; and the father draws the guards away in the other direction making it safer for Tris.  Both of which create a bitter-sweet moment that added to the book.  The movie didn't convey that, at least not very well.

Maybe a small detail but I just wanted to comment on it.",1421280000,,1273,4.233333333333333

There are very good stars in the movie like Shailene Woodley, Ashley Judd, Ansel Egort, and Kate Winslet.  Tris's (Shailene Woodley) good friend Four (Theo James) is very good in it as well, and good - looking!  Overall, great movie that's definitely worth owning!

6101033,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I have never read the Divergent YA novel.  I had no preconceived notions of how a character should act or look.  So everything on the screen was completely new and I did not mentally go over the plot differences from the novel.  I must state I loved this movie.

The premise is that after an apocalyptic type of war, people are grouped into five different factions.  These factions all have differing functions and personalities and once people choose a faction, there's no changing.  It's how people are categorized for life.  To be factionless, is the worst fate imaginable, you are without a home, uncared for and unwanted. Young adults choose their faction based on an aptitude test which happens through a mental dream like state.  Heroine Tris discovers she has abilities and talents in several factions making her different and Divergent.  She chooses the faction Dauntless which acts as the police/military for the city.

Dauntless is a brave group of warriors and Tris has her work cut our for her.  The training is difficult and intense.  One of her training instructors, a man named Four, becomes both mentor and love interest.  Tris is smart and curious and when she discovers that her parent's  faction is at risk (they do not belong to Dauntless), she takes great risks to save her old faction.

This whole totalitarian theme with a bit of romance and fast paced action was supremely entertaining.  The leads had fantastic chemistry but also vulnerability.  Shailene Woodley hits the right note in just about every scene.  She is spunky and brave but also there is a quiet control to her actions too. She is believable in all her emotions from feeling insecure about her ability to survive Dauntless training to her growing romantic feelings for her instructor.  Theo James who plays Four is also good. He represents both strength and fairness.  He is the perfect man for a woman who has those same traits.

This movie is the beginning of a trilogy and I look forward to the next installment.",1421107200,,2006,4.8240469208211145

It was diffidently different from the book but not my much really. Well okay a lot. Well more of with Four since Four was described totally different in the book but he was still good as Four.

I am just so happy with the way that it turned out since it turned out really well. I love this book and I love this movie just as much and I can't wait for the other three movies.

6101070,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I loved this movie.  It was way better than the book...although to be fair, I read the book after watching the movie...perhaps that made a difference.  I liked how the characters were portrayed better in the movie than in the book.  There were times in the book where I didn't understand Four's character or even like him (he really did seem a bit sadistic at times in the book).  The same could be said for Christina and Will.  I also think the script writers take on the simulations made more sense than the author's.  The movie did a great job of taking what was great about the book and making it even better.  I can't say that about many movie adaptations of books, but this was superbly done.

*Possible Spoiler Alert*
The only thing I liked about the book better was the explanation of her bird tattoo (one bird for each of the family members she left behind) and the glimpse into her mother's background (her mom was originally dauntless, but was also divergent.  She was saved because her mom...grandmother of Tris...was a dauntless leader and told her to choose a different faction for her safety.  She chose abnegation).  There were a couple of conversations/meetings that happened between Tris and Four in the book that weren't included in the movie that I did like (For example, he was the one who told her about the hamburger and to put Ketchup on it and there were a few more kisses between the two in the book), but they weren't really important to the plot and it made sense the script writers wouldn't include them.",1420588800,,1533,4.5787545787545785

6101076,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This is an interesting story, with a good (although simple) plot, as well as good screenplay, direction, cinematography, effects, and acting.  The premise of the story is interesting:  that people choose to belong to one of five social factions; and if you don't fit into a faction, you're considered an outcast - and possibly a rebel, so to speak.  This is not far off of our present culture, where most people conform (even promote) the status quo, where most people are followers (and even seek leadership from others), and where most humans do not know who they are and cannot think for themselves.

In this story there's an interesting character, Beatrice (or Trice) who is a non-conformist.  I enjoyed her character arc, beginning as an uncertain girl, not knowing where she belonged, and ending the film as someone who because . . .  well, you decide.

This is a simple plot with few interesting nuances.  It is somewhat predictable - although I nonetheless enjoyed the unfolding of the story.  This film also took me out of my comfort zone, because I found myself uncomfortable with the pervasive 'zombie-type' behavior of the culture.

It is nonetheless an enjoyable story, and I recommend it primarily to the younger generation.",1420502400,,1238,4.93719806763285

6101134,5,B00GQQ77IU,Divergent is a must see movie. It has good amount of action and romance. Shaliene Woodley did an amazing job! She is a amazing actress. Theo James also did an amazing job. He is so hottttt! I have a major crush on him now and watch this movie everyday! He talked less in the movie than he did in book. But it was ok he used very good facial expressions. Everyone should see this movie who is 13 years older.,1419984000,,407,4.1

6101167,2,B00GQQ77IU,"Being a fan of the Hunger Games films (and books), I figured I would give this one a try as it seems to be in the same vein. Of course, lightening doesn't always strike the same place twice and this one was a miss.

I don't know anything about the books, and the film didn't give me any interest to read them either. It just seems like another attempt for Hollywood to cash in on the young adult, dystopian wave that has become so popular. Hunger Games, Divergent, The Maze...

The movie did explain the concept going on, but I just didn't care about the story. It wasn't really engaging or even interesting past a certain point. It felt like they rushed to include so much content. The movie went from dragging to rapid pace. Less than half-way in, I was ready for either a point to get made or for the thing to just go off.",1419724800,,825,4.248407643312102

Wouldn't happen.  I'm sorry, it's just biology.  Men are way bigger and stronger no matter how bad Hollywood or women in general would like to wish it.

It's an exciting movie with some good science fiction illustrations of computer and mind control drugs to wonder about.  I have to object to movies however that show a man fighting with a woman as if it is a fair fight.  This movie has a scene where the main female character - a slender woman, goes up against a man in a boxing ring style fist fight.  Are we really supposed to believe she had a chance?  Who wants to see that?  In the sports world of competitive boxing no one would even want to see a man her size go up against another man so much bigger!  Of course she apparently recovers from her beating in no time at all and the man who did it apparently feels no shame for engaging in such brutality.  This scene went beyond science fiction and injected a huge dose of dramatic farce.",1419552000,,924,4.2701149425287355

I'm glad to see more homely girls getting a shot at carrying a movie, but even that Hunger Games chick could not have saved this. Weak, implausible story, with character development virtually non-existent. It embarrasses me to admit that I sat there watching for as long as I did. I mean, I was trying as hard as possible to like this dang movie, because I did thoroughly enjoy the first 2 Hunger Games and this one had so many similar elements that I thought, perhaps, it might at least turn into Hunger Games Lite. Alas, it wasn't even ultra-lite. I shed tears when the little girl in HG died. I had nothing but apathy for any of these characters. My only tears came from the realization that I had been suckered into watching this by the sheer numbers of 5-Star Amazon reviews. It's mind blowing. COME ON, PEOPLE!!! You canNOT sit there and tell me this movie was as good as it gets. That IS what 5 stars means, ya know? Yeah, buddy. This one here ranks right up there with the greatest films ever!!! Under no circumstances should this thing get more than 3 stars.

And, no, I did not read the book. Didn't know there was one, for that matter. I do get weary hearing from reviewers who say the movie was terrible compared to the book. Good night, if you read the book first, do NOT go to the movie, because 98% of the time, you WILL be disappointed.",1419033600,,1524,4.310104529616725

6101235,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I read the first book of this series and liked it alright so I thought I'd watch the movie.  I did not particularly care for it.  To begin with, Shailene Woodly, who I've liked okay in other films didn't work for me as Tris.  She seemed far too delicate to portray a person capable of being a fierce warrior, nor did her character seem to be particularly intelligent.  She was actually rather bland which is not good since she was the main character.  I don't blame her.  I assume she was following what the director told her to do. There seemed to be more concern with keeping Woodley's hair looking fabulous than giving her a realistic warrior persona.  There was virtually no development of the relationship between Tris and Four.  He went from being abrupt to favoring her in the blink of an eye for very little reason.

Secondly, the script was terrible.  The dialogue was stilted and the story jerked and skipped along in a less than coherent fashion. Had I not read the book, I am not certain I would have known what was going on.  There are some good people in the cast, they just didn't seem to have much to work with when it came to the script.  There was far too much time spent dwelling on less important parts of the story only to suddenly jump to major conflicts with little or no explanation as to why they were happening, just POOF!

6101247,3,B00GQQ77IU,"I've never read the books and I'm not a movie critic. The movie's pacing seemed to be off to me, and the lead actress didn't seem to be fit for the role - she seemed too passive to me. Compared to other women who have excelled as dystopian leading ladies, or action heroines, she does not seem to fit into this category. I think she'd be very good in another role though. However, to her, and all the other actors in this film, credit it also didn't seem to be very well written to me. I was deciding on whether this is a fun, casual popcorn flick, or a well made dystopian picture with deeper themes and meaning. I'm somewhere in between. Still, it was enjoyable to watch especially if you have no prior knowledge of the books, characters, or actors.",1418688000,,751,4.333333333333333

6101270,5,B00GQQ77IU,"One of my favorite fantasy movies of late.  Strong Christian symbolism--poses strong questions about what makes a moral decision and how to balance differences in society.  The romance is passionate and beautiful but respectful; both men and women can relate to it.  Touches on family and work privileges and disadvantages.  Deals with sacrifice and--a big issue today--managing feelings of helplessness and fear.

6101274,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Speaking as a former psych therapist.. and avid Sci Fi fan/critic.. I find Divergent worthy of high regard. Many critics tore it apart, but I often view most critics as wild wolves roaming the alleyways of entertainment. The story is a good watch for adults and young people alike.. though if you are someone who does not want your child seeing violence of any kind.. please keep that in mind. Theme of the Movie... without any spoilers.... In the real world we often want to protect our kids from adult themes as long as possible. But is that possible today? And is it wise, considering how we are devolving as a species this Millennium? The positive messages of this movie outweigh ANY negatives. The message is simple - that it's good to be different and it is good to appreciate our differences.. that there are always bad people who will try to rob us of our gifts and punish us for our differences. It is okay to lead 'the good fight' and it also okay to just follow.",1418169600,,973,4.47191011235955

6101298,5,B00GQQ77IU,"When I first heard about Divergent, I though the first Hunger Games rip off was upon us, and besides that the whole story seemed somewhat confusing. It is Science Fiction and Directed by Neil Berger, the mind behind Limitless, so I decided to give it a shot, and it was the best idea I had in a long time.
In a post war America, the city of Chicago is fenced off from the rest of the world, and has split into five factions of people. At the age of 18, all citizens must take an aptitude test, to determine where they belong. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) is one of the girls taking the test as the movie starts, and her results show that she has an aptitude for all five factions, making her Divergent. Divergent's are highly intelligent, rebellious, and seen as a threat to the Government, so she hides her results and joins Dauntless, the equivalent of the National Guard in Chicago. During her rough training, the now renamed Trice, meets up with Four (Theo James) who she has an instant connection to, but who is also a threat to her secret identity. One thing that was never explained is why these people have to take the aptitude test, if they are allowed to join whichever faction they choose. It's a major plot hole and the only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars, as I really hate plot holes. Shailene Woodley stars as Trice, making the jump from TV to film, and she has done it with a bang. In much the same way Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect choice to play Katniss, Woodley was perfect for the role of Trice, and brought so much more to the film than I ever thought she would. Theo James is also terrific as Four, the mysterious trainer and love interest of Trice, and together the team is the perfect pair. Divergent is highly original, really well written, and introduced Hollywood to a whole slew of new stars, not to mention it's Director, Neil Burger, is on one hell of a successful run of films. Divergent has everything I look for in a film and in my favorite genre, and for that it is now one of our must see movies!",1417910400,4,2042,4.3905013192612135

I am not sure how I missed this movie when it originally released, but I have it now! I did find a few times the movie strayed away from the book, but both were worth my time.",1417305600,,456,4.010989010989011
6101361,3,B00GQQ77IU,"As a standalone movie, it's a good one, hence the three stars. As an adaptation of the book it fails and I'll tell you why.

First and most important annoyance: In the book, Tris is a very strong female character. Personally, I think this series gets that right better than any other YA series out there right now. Especially when you read the stories from Four's point of view you realize that he is consistently amazed at how smart and strong she is. That's lost from the movie where it comes off as him helping her all the time. My favorite scene from the book is when they go through Four's fear landscape because it shows that - Tris helps him through each step and when the landscape ends he is looking at her with awe and admiration. In the movie, it's all about him helping her prepare for her final test. He doesn't seem the least bit scared when it starts with them on the windy beam when fear of heights is one of his greatest fears.

Second annoyance: In the book, the romance is so tentative and slow. There are many small moments where he just touches her back as they're walking or they carefully move closer to each other just to see what it would be like. In the movie there are only a couple moments like that and then BOOM they're making out on his balcony. Four is just as inexperienced as she is with the other sex but the only time we see that is a flash when she touches the tattoos on his back (which, if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't even realize that's why he startled). The scene in his fear landscape for confinement in the book is so much better than in the movie both for her lack of taking the lead with helping him through it (instead of him telling her how in the movie) and the awkwardness of being so close to each other for the first time.

I'll leave the age difference out of it because Shailene Woodley and Theo James have such great chemistry.

I still look forward to the next movies where I hope they can make up for making her seem weak in this one but the romance part is already ruined for me.",1417305600,3,2046,4.2384615384615385

I watched in horror as they beat women, with women and a man, and lets not leave out the rape e scene. If you grew up watching movies, you would agree, that the director should take a collegiate level film course, just so he can say, I put in a few hours examining the mechanics of a movie. I struggled to watch this movie. There were so many ways this film could have developed the best parts of the book, and yet they didn't. I mean who was the director's intended audience?

6101395,3,B00GQQ77IU,"So here we have yet another movie that has an evil person or group who is trying to take over the world, or whatever is left of it, and the only ones who can stop them are a couple of super attractive teenagers with impeccable hair and make up.  And yes if you are thinking that this is basically the plot of the Hunger Games with a few changes made, then you are absolutely right.

It's also like a lot of other teen movies in the fashion that this incredibly powerful evil person can only be stopped by a couple of teenagers.  Also there is their version of the ""Reaping,"" from the Hunger Games and the ""Sorting Hat"" ceremony from Harry Potter.  Also just like in those other movies, being sorted or reaped doesn't matter because you can just ask to be put in a faction.  Just like Harry asked to be put into Griffindor and Katniss volunteered to be tribute for the games.

And speaking of these 5 factions, what teenager in their right mind would choose any faction other than Dauntless?  I mean if any teenager had the choice between the 5 of these groups they would see these guys and think they are the coolest thing ever and instantly want to join.  I mean seriously, what teenager in their right mind would want to be a farmer?  Or live a life of what is basically suffering to help others?  The others are what I can only describe as brainiacs and paper-pushers.

Not to mention that during this ceremony, they are only using one knife to cut the hand of every teenager there.  One kid with any kind of disease like Hepatitis, and they are all screwed!

The story itself is kinda interesting and it does keep you watching, but it does have it's flaws.  For example, every five minutes someone is talking about, their rankings and how their rankings will effect them or how if they don't get good rankings, they will be cut out of Dauntless.  I will admit that Beatrice is a much more interesting main character than Katniss ever was and she does actually have some good motivations.

For those who watched and enjoyed The Hunger Games, Divergent will certainly appeal to them as well.  Conversely, if you did NOT like The Hunger Games, you might find yourself drawn to Divergent.

Many years from now when mankind has yet screwed itself up again through wars and ignorance, society suggests divests itself into five recognized factions and the factionless.  Different factions control different functions.  For instance, the Erudite are the thinkers and Dauntless are the protectors.  Those outside the norm who embrace two or more qualities are known as Divergents.  Being a Divergent is not a good thing.

This is the story of Tris, name shortened by herself from Beatice, upon choosing her faction, Dauntless, and the trials and tribulations she faces during her training and initiate period.  To say much more would be to spoil the plot.",1416441600,,958,4.9748427672955975

6101459,2,B00GQQ77IU,The book was amazing. What made it so was the depth of characters that was based largely off of descriptions of their body language and demeanor and being inside Tris' head from her perspective. It was a richly written and well thought out society that doesn't pull punches. It can be brutal and unapologetically somber. It plays with ideas of human nature and corruption as part of the human condition. It is beautiful. The movie was none of the above. They took too much creative license to alter the book. The casting was flat to say the least. There was no sense of what Abnegation was truly or any other faction for that matter. It broke good writing 101 and told the viewer everything instead of showing and revealing. Tris' parents were completely off as were her friends and foes. Four in the story was full of depth but Theo James fell short of this role. It was a tired and pointless plot where they tried to do too much with too little and left out the true meaning. It was plain awful. Skip this drizzle and read the book instead. Please don't judge the book based on this film. It is truly an insulting rendition.,1416182400,,1126,4.470873786407767
6101460,3,B00GQQ77IU,"First sign you are watching a movie geared toward 21 and under is the conspicuous absence of violence along with the heroine going up against men bigger than her yet somehow suffering MINIMUM brutality. I can't even start on the mellowness of Theo James. Only proves in my book Milla Jovovich, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson are the few women in Hollywood who can sell violence. Second sign of this movie that it is geared toward a younger crowd is a quiet revolution following a quiet hostile takeover. When was the last time you saw that? The premise doesn't break new ground if you've seen the likes of Equilibrium, The Matrix or Elysium. Familiar tale, familiar theme and a weak 'romance' don't really flesh out the rest. My kingdom for a movie for young adults that doesn't coddle.",1416182400,,793,4.753623188405797

6101462,3,B00GQQ77IU,A solid adaptation of the best-selling novel. Shailene Woodley is too attractive to be Tris but I can look past that because she plays the role well. I think it would be enjoyable even if you didn't read the book.,1416182400,,213,4.35

6101466,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I suppose that with all the hype about it I should have realised that it had no merit of its own, but I didn't.

When I finally got the copy from the library and finished watching it, I was sorry I'd wasted my time--and glad I hadn't bought a copy!  Predictable stock plot, characters that don't appeal, and a forgettable ending (really!  I can't remember how it ended, it made so little impression).

Now there's apparently a second film in the same series, which made me think of the third Crocodile Dundee film, where a crooked film company made ""Lethal Agent"", which bombed, so they made ""Lethal Agent II"", which also bombed, and were in  the process of making ""Lethal Agent III"".  I doubt that this ""Divergent"" sequel is a coverup for skulduggery the way the ""Lethal Agent"" ones were, but judging by ""Divergent"" it won't be any more appealing.

I'd say maybe it's just that I'm very far outside their target demographic, but I quite like the Hunger Games trilogy, both the books and, so far, the films.",1416096000,4,1007,4.592178770949721

6101488,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I didn't read the books so I don't have any thoughts on adaptation

Among dystopian movies this one should be placed in the bottom half. Not the worst but doesn't add anything to the genre

The society is ordered as I imagine many 12 year olds believe the world is organized, nerds, tattle tails, nice people, and tough guys.
I was doing okay and playing along with the writers logic until I saw people whooping and jumping off trains. I'm fine with the teeny message of finding yourself instead of letting others define you,  however the execution of this message was shallow and sloppy.

I'm seeing a trend in movies where it seems like they have a solid idea of how a movie will go up until the last third, when it just becomes a rush to wrap things up with a bang. The story went off the rails in the last 30 minutes and became a mash of action  movie clichs and eventually just ripped off I-Robot for villain motive.",1415836800,3,921,4.362573099415204

But anyway, my only other compliant was the throwing of the knives scene. The sound effects were phenomenal but the knives were so obviously fake, and looked like it, that it drove me insane! On another plus, the scene with Shai flying was very well done. As were other scenes here and there. Overall, for myself, the movie was one I have already watched 3 times and will watch again.

Is it even possible in this day and age to make a dystopic science fiction film without it feeling somehow derivative of so many earlier, better works? I tend to doubt it.

Take ""Divergent,"" a futuristic tale based on the book by Veronica Roth, itself just the first in a series of  novels aimed primarily at young adults. Right off the bat, one can see that ""Divergent"" owes a great deal to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" both being set in a society built on a strict caste system, where every member of the community is assigned a social level and a specialized task from which there is basically no escape. The difference is that, in Huxley's world, one is engineered from ""conception"" to be a member of a certain caste, while, in Roth`s, individuals are, theoretically at least, free to choose, at one crucial point in their adolescence, the group to which they will forever belong.

In ""Divergent,"" there are five categories or ""factions,"" as they`re called here, only two of which have any real significance in the film: Abnegation, whose principal function is selfless service to the community, and Dauntless, which serves, essentially, as the police force in this walled-off, post-apocalyptic version of old Chicago. Caught in the middle is a young woman named Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who, while raised in Abnegation, finds that she may actually be what is called a ""Divergent,"" a rare individual who fits comfortably into more than one category, making her an existential threat to the stability of this homogeneous society, where everyone knows his or her place and role. Beatrice opts to join Dauntless, a decision which leads to innumerable training sequences that seem to drag on for a minor eternity.

Par for the course for the dystopic genre, our divergent heroine soon finds herself on the run from diabolical government forces (led by Kate Winslet) bent on destroying her lest she throw a monkey wrench into their ""peaceful,"" ""well-oiled,"" ""harmonious"" society.

And that's pretty much all the movie is about. Throw in some dreamscape elements straight out of ""Total Recall"" and ""Inception"" - both much better films, by the way -  and soon we find ourselves heading down the rabbit-hole into incoherence and confusion from which it becomes virtually impossible to extricate ourselves.

Even decent - if pretty much standard, at this point - production values can't rescue a generally drab film.",1414972800,2,2428,5.022388059701493

The story finds us in a dystopian future Chicago. A good portion of the city is in ruins and it is surrounded by a wall. The citizens are divided into five different factions. When the children come of age they must select which group they will join.""Faction before blood"" is the motto.
Woodley is the lead character and when her time arrives she chooses the ""Dauntless""faction;an ersatz police department which resembles a group of parkours than anything else. She has been tested beforehand and it was found that she was the film title""divergent"".That is,she fit in to no particular faction. She was told to keep her mouth shut and tell no one. She enters the Dauntless group and she is put through three separate tests, along with all the other initiates. Tests can involve anything from plain fighting and  shooting skills to psychological testing. In fact psychotropic drugs are used in a variety of ways to either test or control. The latter is what eventually brews as Woodley is completing her training into the ""Dauntless"".It seems the leader of another faction led by Winslet is preparing to take over the city. To do that they have injected each ""Dauntless""member with a drug with which they can be controlled.
Winslet and company direct them to go to an area of the city in which Woodley's parents live. There they are forced to start eliminating the population there. Woodley and other different faction members who have rebelled, join her and storm the facility where Winslet is. After a struggle they overpower them and Woodley injects Winslet with the same drug the latter used on the ""Dauntless"".After a quick wiping of the computer program, the slaughter of the innocents comes to a halt. Woodley boards an El which she and her friends ride to the end of the line;to the wall. They are now factionless, but have each other.
At no time in the film could I get up enough empathy to care about anything I was watching .It was like being injected with the same psychotropic drug used on the screen. I felt like I was sleep walking. Woodley has about as much charisma as a tree. It was like watching an even more sober Katness Averdeen(Hunger Games).Unfortunately the tone/dynamic/vibe we get with her character bleeds into everyone and everything else and it is.........borrrring.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include trailers,commentary and deleted scenes.
All in all an approximately 140 minute yawnfest of monumental proportions. I think they were going for a similar Hunger Games type lead character, but Woodley does not have the acting chops to get there. That coupled with the somnambulistic plot,and we have a film that will engender not one feeling of....anything,one way or another. Forget engagement or excitement of any kind. In fact,forget it altogether.",1414886400,,3090,5.03515625

There is also the strong feminine hero in this story.  However, this is where the similarities end, except for the fact, that she will--most likely--bring the government down.  The movie did foreshadow this.  Divergent is a dystopian societal story that seems to be a combination of many classics from the past.

The characters are believable and the story intriguing.  After watching once, I couldn't wait to see it again.  Moreover, I can't wait for the second in the film series.",1414540800,,653,5.037383177570093

The trailers I saw seemed to make the movie out to be something it wasn't. I was prepared for a different movie experience, something a bit supernatural, mystical, something like that. The trailers seemed to me to make the ""Divergent's"" out to be somehow significantly different, somehow dangerous like a mutant with power that scare the establishment.  What did I get? An altered ""Hunger Games"" with some elements of ""Logan's Run"" added in and over all done poorly.

I do agree with issues mentioned in other reviews but plot simplification along with staying true to the story put severe limitations on all the production staff.

I would have rated the movie lower as a stand alone product instead of an appeal to fans of the novels.",1412985600,,507,4.419354838709677

Instead we have the heart rending family trauma as both children freely choose leave their parents' faction.  They will live totally different lives, cut off from everyone and everything they ever knew.  There's no turning back.  These choices are 'forever'.  Really heavy stuff here. Boy chooses, oh, nevermind.  Girl chooses warrior!  We got brutal training in kevlar leotard armor, cold and cruel to conceal forbidden love.  Not enough action for a guy movie.

What more do you want for entertainment?  The film reflects many aspects of today's societies worldwide and is extremely plausible.  Strong rulers take power and control the masses through all methods of manipulation, and we, the people support them in doing so through our laziness or ignorance.  But the real power lies within the people and the hands of those people who take the responsibility to act.  Within the humanrace, it is the 'divergents' who are the free thinkers, recognize that there is no set reality other than what we create (""it is not real"").  They are the ones who break out of or away from the status quo in an attempt to awaken the masses to understand that with a bit of awareness and willingness, we can live healthier, more compassionate, responsible and peaceful lives.

Not the greatest of sci-fi movies and I've not read the book so, I have nothing to compare it to except other movies...  that said, it's always nice to see women in lead roles but it's typical of this genre and very very predictable.  I liken it to a coming of age movie... teenage girl wants to find herself and go her own way, goes on a dangerous adventure, falls in love, saves the world and comes to realize mom and dad weren't so bad after all.

A common complaint of mine with a lot of these sci-fi futuristic movies... if the civilization can create sophisticated machines and devices that can see into and control the human mind or travel at the speed of light why don't they also improve or at least show an evolved kind of living condition... just seems like they scrimp on the set to save costs but to me it just screams lack of commitment to a quality movie.

6101906,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I believe we should put the ""movie"" Divergent into a time capsule and bury it deep in the Earth's crust. When the new inhabitants of Earth arrive, they can discover it and understand quickly why we wiped ourselves from the face of the planet.

If it's not clear, this movie is terrible.  Hunger Games was watchable, this movie is a poorly devised knock-off with almost zero redeemable qualities.  To guarantee to ruin the experience of this movie, I suggest you notice how often the ""cool"" faction hoots, hollers, and otherwise ""woos"" and ""whoots"" when performing only mildly interesting activities, e.g. running, walking quickly, running up and down stairs, and high fiving.  You will immediately hate all of them and go back to watching something far more valuable, like the puppy channel.",1412121600,,791,5.015267175572519
6101907,3,B00GQQ77IU,Tried to be futuristic but ended up being completely senseless and boring,1412121600,,73,5.166666666666667
6101908,3,B00GQQ77IU,"First off I am going to start with, I did not read the books.  I am only going by what I saw in the movie.  So I can only assume I am missing a few things.  Maybe if I read the books I would care a little more about what is going on.  Maybe the story wouldnt be so bleh.  Maybe you couldn't poke holes in everything, or the plot wasn't so in your face easy to figure out.  This made it difficult for me.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the danger they were in, and I didn't really care about the love story either.  That being said, I didn't totally hate it.  The movie just felt like it was going through the motions.
To give you a little bit of what I am talking about, my wife and I like to talk about the movie after it is done to see how we both thought of it.  We both came to the same conclusion, and just didn't understand why a society would willfully create a utopian like society by creating factions which segregate people into 5 faction (6 really, but I will get to that later).  They are:
1. Abnegation (Selfless) Always help those in need
2. Erudite (Intelligent) The engineers
3. Dauntless (Brave) The military or teenagers getting to do what they want
4. Amity (Peaceful) The Buddhists
5. Candor (Honest).  They just never lie  whooped dee-doo
The movie made it seem like these factions couldn't intermingle or dont.  Im not sure which.
You are born into one of these factions.  However if you do not like the faction you are in, you could choose to leave and join another faction once you reach a certain age.  Before you do so, you go through a ""test.""  This test is to determine what faction you would be good in before you choose.  A fail safe to not choose poorly.  Once you choose, there is no turning back.  Choosing the faction you were born into would be easiest as you already know what is required of you, choosing a new faction becomes difficult and requires you to go through the trials.  If you fail these trials you become factionless (6th faction).  A dystopian group of homeless faction rejects, the janitors, bus drivers, servants. Now comes the divergent part.  Detergents could be good at all factions and is seen as a threat to the way of their societys norm.  Or as the movie calls it, someone who doesn't think like everyone else.  (Woooo special)  So back to this factionless 6th faction.  Wouldn't this factionless be classified as a faction then?  This faction does not seem to have rules and guidelines like very one else does, a faction with all factions intermingling together to strive (though in poverty).  A faction full of people not thinking like the segregated factioned utopian society.  What this movie seems to call divergent?  (I don't see a huge plot point coming in the following movies, nope not at all)
Now I won't ruin the whole movie by explaining other examples as I am really starting to ramble but this movie is meant to be watched with your brain off.  A movie for teenagers, as this faction that the main character, Beatrice (later to be just known as Tris) chooses, does not have adults.  I think I saw 1, maybe 2 once she chose to join Dauntless.  The movies ""Military"" force.  A faction of teenage heart throbs having to live co-ed, jumping, laughing, and running around all parkour like everywhere they go.  ((((*** This section contains some spoilers - With a captain that of course hates the lead character, and a co-captain that loves her who is also a hidden Divergent (if you didn't see it coming a mile away then please start using Lumosity.  You brain could really use some exercise)))
I think I will stop now.  If you want to watch this movie, watch it without expectations.  Watch it with your brain off.  Watch it if you are a parent and your teenage daughter wants to watch it with you, or if you yourself are a teenage daughter.  Otherwise you will be a bit disappointed.",1412121600,4,3879,4.453125

At certain age all young adults are committed to choosing which faction they wish to join and once they have made a choice they are stuck in it for the rest of their lives.

6101938,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I gave it as much of a chance as I could stomach (about 25 minutes).  It's definitely a movie aimed at girls who are not yet old enough to drive and who lack a fair amount of sophistication.  The imagined society of the future seemed like the product of a 15 year old's imagination, and some of the concepts were downright nonsensical to the point of being absurd.  (I had to laugh every time the ""Dauntless"" faction was featured; they're an over the top bunch of buffoons who always seem to think everything is ""super rad, man"" and who take all sorts of unnecessary risks for no apparent reason other than to ...well, I don't know; there really is no reason for most of what they do.)

Too much of a thinly disguised attempt at social commentary on coming of age and trying to chose one's place in society.  A theme that I just cannot identify with anymore, and even when I could, this movie was just too dumb to have had much appeal for me.

Skip it and wait until it's free and you are literally dying of boredom.  Or, if you're a 13 year old girl, beg your parents to let you watch it; it's about your speed.",1411948800,6,1112,4.266666666666667

6101982,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Loved this movie- can't wait for Insurgent!  My husband and I are not typically ""action"" movie watchers but gave this a try after reading the books. It's definitely not as good as the book, but what movie is?  I thought it felt real, and accurate to the book. I expected Tris to be smaller and more ""frail"" as described in the book, but Woodley did a nice job otherwise.  I thought Theo James gave a great representation of Four- tough, strong, cold when needed, but showed a soft spot for Tris.  If you enjoyed the book, I don't know why you wouldn't enjoy this movie.  Without reading the books I think there could be some confusing parts, but that's what rewind is for right?",1411689600,,678,4.435483870967742

6101985,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Although lacking in certain areas, Divergent is a decent start to a franchise. Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Kate Winslet, and Jai Courtney constitute the best scenes of the film. Woodley and James, in particular, have a fiery chemistry.  However,  for such a large cast, too few supporting characters are memorable. A lost opportunity indeed. The second installment is sure to step the game up.",1411689600,,395,5.15625

6101990,2,B00GQQ77IU,"Maybe it's an age group thing. Maybe it's a gender thing. My 16-year-old daughter didn't want to see this until she'd read the novel, so I (male, 54) watched it by myself. I can't believe I sat through the entire film, waiting for something new and fresh to appear, or even something re-done, but re-done well. Ah, well...

If you're familiar with Brave New World, Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang, or even Aeon Flux or Gattica, save your money; you've seen this before - better.

I won't delve into the story beyond the above. Perhaps the novel is different; I don't know (and likely won't read it). Suffice it to say that I was unimpressed with the explanation of how Society reached the point where this film started, whether (spoiler alert) Chicago was just isolated or the last urban area left (almost) standing, and why the City was sort of half modern metropolis and half post-apocalyptic ruin. <sigh>

As for the film on its own merits, other than the heroine, all of the other characters - to a person - fell completely flat for me. Even her compatriot seems more than a little two-dimensional. Ashley Judd can - and does - act better than she did in this film, though the script surely didn't help (I think she might have done better had she had more to deliver beyond a dozen lines).

I'm glad that I opted for SD on Amazon instead of HD on FiOS for this, saving a couple $$ in the process.",1411603200,,1400,4.45703125

6102063,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This is another instalment of the latest teen fad in literature of a post war world where everyone had been divided up (for our own good) into culture groups, in this case they are based on personality lines.  The storyline is granted predictable, but is quite action packed and holds your interest.  Shailene Woodley does a great job in the lead role, and it doesn't hurt that she's quite attractive.

Divergent's set up is when teens reach a certain age they get to choose which cultural group they will become a part of.  The catch is that they can never change their mind.  Obviously the beginning of a series of movies this one mainly tackles the main character Tris' experience in her chosen group, where everything isn't as exciting as it seemed it would be, and to her horror, she is not automatically part of the society, she in fact has to compete to be worthy of staying, which amongst other tasks includes violent fights with other teens (although being a teen aimed movie, no one ever bleeds or breaks bones etc as would be the case in real life).  If she doesn't qualify in the top part of her intake, she will be kicked out and forbidden from joining any other social group, forced to live amongst a group which is pretty much the same as being homeless in our world, where of course safety and food are scarce.  Tris is of course (as is usually the case with this genre) different, she questions things, doesn't blindly want to follow orders, and can see the bigger picture of the evil of her fellow human, that is growing around her in relation to the wider world.  This is of course a pretty dangerous way of being.

I enjoyed Divergent a lot more than similar genre recent movies based on teen books such as Ender's Game and the Hunger Games.  There is obviously a lot more story to be told in this movie's world, I just hope the sequels can live up to this one (how boring was the second Hunger games film!).",1411171200,,1928,4.451704545454546

6102131,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent was a film that was something else.  Based in a world which is divided by factions based on your way of thinking, Tris learns that she doesn't fit into any of them and that she is actually Divergent which means she won't fit into their way of thinking.  With the help of fellow Dauntless Four, the two of them discover a plot to destroy Divergents.  The two of them must stop this plot before its too late and they are all destroyed.  This film is based on the novel written by Veronica Roth and the screenplay for it was written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor.  Neil Burger was in charge of directing this film and prior to this he was known for films such as The Illusionist and Limitless. This film is based in the future in Chicago where the society has divided into 5 factions because they believe that is the order which is the best way to survive.  Those factions are Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful.  There is also one group that roams the streets because they do not belong to any of the groups and they are Factionless.  When the teenagers come of age which is 16, they must chose if they want to stay with their birth faction or move to another faction.  If they chose to move though they are not allowed to go back and the rule is Faction before blood so you are forced to forget about your family if you leave them behind.  After watching her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chose to leave his faction, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) must make the decision to stay where she knows she doesnt belong or transfer and leave her family behind.  She chose to go to Dauntless and leave her parents Natalie (Ashley Judd) and Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) behind.  She is not a full fledge Dauntless yet because there is a highly competitive initiation that she must pass to stay a Dauntless or get kicked out and become Factionless.  When Beatrice became Dauntless she chose to change her name as well and she is now known as Tris and she must make some tough decisions, but being a Divergent means that she has to keep a secret that could mean death.  All of these struggles are minor considering the struggles that her mentor, Four (Theo James) seems to be hiding. Four and her grow to love each other which helps when things get worse which they do, because there is something bigger that nobody seems to know about that threatens to tear the city apart.

The film was very enjoying to watch and I loved the scene above.  Everyone that changed factions is told that the only way into the city is to jump off the building.  Its awesome because you are forced to take a leap of faith or leave the faction immediately and Beatrice is the first person with courage enough to step up and do it.  After she does it of course she is safe because there was nothing to harm her at the bottom because there was something to break their fall.  There are so many scenes that are extremely thrilling in this film that if you are not a Dauntless at heart this may not be the film for you.

 Overall I give this movie an A.  This is one of the best films based off of a book that I have seen since Jurassic Park.  I really had a connection with the characters and believed it because the chemistry was there with the whole cast!  When they were sad you really wanted to shed a tear, if they were mad you got mad with them.  I wanted to jump in and help which is what I want from a film.  I want it to bring me into the environment and this one did.  If you haven't seen this one yet I definitely suggest that you go and check this one out!!",1410912000,,3623,4.328888888888889

6102159,2,B00GQQ77IU,"In the future, when you turn 18, Hillary Clinton will put you in one of 5 categories, the jocks get to bully people, the nerds read books in big glassy buildings, the stoners get to farm the land (and we all know what they are growing) and two types of political casts, one for the liberal arts majors and one for the preppies, but don't worry they are all very attractive people and while society went to pieces over some unexplained cataclysm this has seemingly emboldened people to take better care of themselves...

Anyway, the preppies, lets just call them 'Conservatives' about had it with how shoddy the arts majors, or 'Democrats' have run the place and they decide to do something about it by using the Jocks for a coup, preventing this entails lots of tiresome and predictable running around and shooting at things.

Like all movie this one, just as Hunger Games will in retrospect reflect a time in which people were obsessed with looks and appearances and a growing unease with the establishment without the ability to impact true change, because just like in real life while a crisis was narrowly averted, no real change came, the caste system is still in effect with our main protagonists having simply left a system that doesn't work for them.",1410825600,,1258,4.713636363636364

The special effects were good.  I wish they had spent more time explaining the significance of the simulations, and less time with filler.  The teacher / student relationship is a bit more exaggerated in the movie, more inappropriate than in the books, she looks like a child, he looks like an adult ten or more years older.

6102186,3,B00GQQ77IU,"I wanted to see this movie as i have heard some good things about it. The movie strikes me as more a ""made for tv"" movie than a ""movie"" movie.

The plot is good, the characters are a bit single dimensional (i.e. the good guys are always good, and the bad guys not really bad, they are just miss guided).  I won't provide any spoilers in this review, but will say the show does not feel like a completely story.  It could have ended a few minutes before it did, but instead it ends more like a TV pilot; ready made for ether an on-going TV series.

If you have not see this yes, i would recommend renting it first.  Its a fun watch, but its not substantive, or visually complex enough to be something I would watch more than once.",1410739200,,729,4.141843971631205

6102189,5,B00GQQ77IU,"the movie is very close to the book story, who read the book will agree....",1410739200,,75,4.066666666666666
6102190,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I have very mixed opinions about this story. The tense atmosphere amongst the divided factions works well, but the romance is incredibly predictable and unnecessary.

Woodley strongly asserts herself as Tris, someone who defies conformity and is shown to be very brave in harsh times, but I felt that the (budding) connection between herself and 'Four' (Theo James) was forced and only there for the contrivity of having the two lead characters get together. He makes sense as her brooding mentor, but I question if anyone would have been so interested in Tris and Four getting together had Mr James not been British or so attractive. Don't get me wrong, he's fine as the generic action lead male, and I can see why he was chosen (despite being much older than the actual book character) but his swift change to being her love interest did not work for me.

The other problem with DIVERGENT is that it doesn't bring anything new to the table in this era of Young Adult adaptations, it merely depicts those same cliched ideas already covered in a vast majority of movies and television shows. A basic summary: the lead female character longs to break free from a world she does not relate to and be with her brooding boyfriend who is burdened by daddy issues. Nevertheless, it's that same storyline that seems to draw in big box office numbers, so somehow, the younger generation's enthusiasm to see the same storyline over and over again amongst different movie franchises keeps these YA series popular in the media.

Some pros of the movie: the energetic score, which elevates the pace and emotion of the film; Tris' inventive ways of escaping the hallucinations; and the down-to-earth dynamic of the Prior family - although even this was marginally ruined by how the parents' journeys reach their conclusion. The underground feel of the Dauntless faction also works well, as does the superior styled setting of Erudite.

Reportedly, ALLEGIANT will be divided into two movies, and this only adds to the repetitive structure of YA adaptations as I have mentioned. I will probably watch INSURGENT, if only out of curiosity as to where the train takes the surviving characters.",1410739200,,2175,4.9021739130434785

****** spoiler below:

 I wish they hadn't changed Tris' fear of being intimate with Four to him trying to overpower her or even rape her; that was totally unnecessary. I can kind of see why they did it because since she didn't narrate except at the beginning and the end, it'd be hard to explain all her feelings of not wanting to become intimate with him.

**** end spoiler.

It's really crazy how even a longer-than-average running time movie like this can still feel like  a skeleton of the book itself. But I think they did a very good job with those 2 hours and 20 minutes. No huge things were changed, no enormous plot points were left out, nothing stupid was added. I thought the casting was terrific. Shailene Woodley did a fantastic job, and is a great actress.",1410652800,,1007,4.451086956521739

For the first 2 hours, I kept asking: ""What will happen next?"" I could not guess what was coming. It's suspenseful and interesting. Shailene Woodley `s and Theo James's acting were convincing. The plot is original to me. I have never read the book on which this film was based.

The director took time to develop his characters. Even though it's more than 2 hours long, it was never boring.

The hand fighting scenes between Shailene looked forced but it's just a minor thing.

According to boxoffice mojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:
Release Date: March 21, 2014
Production Budget: $85 million
Domestic:  $150,947,895
+ Foreign:  $123,997,344
= Worldwide:  $274,945,239

So, it's popular both domestically and internationally.

It took in approximately 189 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.

In short, it's one of the most ORIGINAL and SUSPENSEFUL movies of 2014. I'm looking forward to watching the sequels.",1410393600,,1105,4.9890710382513666

6102283,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Quick Story recap:  In a futuristic world where people are separated into life paths in a sort of harry potter/hunger games fashion (oh you are a pacific go live with the farming people, oh you are aggressive you will be the warriors)  The power struggle between factions becomes a war and the characters must fight.

I feel like this movie is a cheap Hunger Games knock-off with the female lead not even living up to a Jennifer Lawrence like performance.  I wasn't impressed with this film by any means. It was decent enough to watch it to the end, however, nothing I'd watch again or recommend to any one.  I thought every facet of this movie was average at best (acting, pace, script, cinematography).  There are better ways to spend a few hours than watch this movie.  I'm still trying to figure out how this movie got 5 stars on Amazon.  If you are reading reviews before you watch please don't get sucked in by the people who rated this WAY TOO HIGH.  There are sequels, and I definitely won't be watching those.",1410393600,,1018,4.51912568306011

Most of the movie is spent on the training of these young people to protect against...what?  There was so much that wasn't very believable including the zombie-like killers at the end.

I'm not sure why people are comparing this movie to The Hunger Games other than the fact that the book was written for a YA audience. This does not even come close to the story of the Hunger Games, in terms of writing, directing and the plot itself. I will say that I have not read the book and probably won't as a result of the movie. I will also say that I am a fan of Shailene Woodly, I loved ""The Stars"" movie and her acting was great.

This movie really lends itself to using internal dialogue, 1. because there was a lot of internal conflict that could have been shared, 2. actors/actresses were not the best at non-verbal communication using facial expressions.

How would I fit into this world?  I purchased this movie after I had already seen it in the theater and knew I would want to watch it over and over.  The bonus features were new though.  There was a ""making of"" feature that had to have been 40 minutes long, lots of extra content there and it was very interesting.

Making each book a single movie might have been a better idea.  A couple so similar looking you can't tell them apart.  My husband loved the movie and hasn't read the books so it's obviously a good movie (he actually wanted to watch it two nights in a row - something he's never done before.)

Things that I liked about the movie are:

- Was a good pace.
- Had a good storyline.
- The romance was not over done, but it was a little awkward.

Things that I liked about this particular purchase:

- Contains digital copy (on iTunes)
- Contains a decent amount of special features

Like I said above, I would give this a 4.5 star rating if I could, but I cannot.

My wife originally LOVED this movie. But that was before she read the book. If you cannot enjoy the movie without separating it from the book, then you probably shouldn't watch the movie (although you most likely already have if you read the book anyway). From what I hear, there are a good amount of changes between the book and the movie (nothing major, but just that she doesn't say I love you in the first book but she does in the movie, etc.)",1409875200,,1077,4.153846153846154

I couldn't place the storyline at first, but eventually it hit me.  THIS IS A STORY ABOUT JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL!!!  It's not a bad movie, but reading between the lines, its High School kids, complete with love story.  All separated into factions, with one group trying to control everyone.  Sort of like, West Side Story without the music and a little more hip and science fiction-ny.  Personally, I was a little bored, once I figured out the storyline.",1409788800,,637,4.625

6102513,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Good, but seems a bit close to Hunger Games. You will wonder where Donald Sutherland went. The genre (young folks fighting an evil government) is being reborn from the 60's and 70's pollution pics (Soylent Green, Silent Running, Them) where non conformers save the world. Only these few farsighted folks understand how to save the planet.

This is strictly an entertainment vehicle. There is not much thinking required. I have not read the trilogy, so I may be a bit hard on the first installment. Maybe it will develop in a sequel. And maybe that is why I had a problem with it. I have never enjoyed movies that had intentionally ambiguous endings. Either have the story stand on its own and make us want to see the next one because it is so good, rather than making us go see the next one because you want to find out what happened in the last one. Having a movie so there can be a sequel is unfair to movie goers and the industry as a whole.

While the acting was good, I think the main characters lacked depth. The development of the characters was fast and then very slow. You can probably guess where things are going (just the title should give you a clue).

The special effects are very good and integrate well in the story. I think teenagers today will identify with the leads, but overall, it seemed formula but I am happy we are finally getting strong female leads instead of the boy saving the world...",1409788800,,1414,4.4517374517374515

The movie is similar to Hunger Games in that it proposes an alternate world with strict conformity, factions, and the main character is female.  The movie is not similar to Hunger Games in that the plot is not well explained, characters aren't developed much besides the two main characters, and frankly it's just plain bad.

From the characters living in prison like conditions, even having no mirrors, but waking up from dead sleep with blow dried hair and makeup; to roll your eyes moments every 15 minutes; this movie's target audience must be for semi comatose people.  Too heavy for children, and to predictable for adults.  NOT RECOMMENDED",1409702400,,688,5.0

6102602,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Set in a future, dystopian Chicago where society has been divided into five factions depending on virtues, young Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) - when tested - learns she is Divergent, a mix of more than two or more factions, really fitting into no one group.  Problem is, for some reason the governing society is threatened by and seeking to capture and destroy all who are Divergent, so after joining the wild Dauntless faction that holds guard over the city, she changes her name to Tris and tries to navigate her training into her new life, all the while trying to hide who she really is while avoiding the unwanted scrutiny of the hardened, mysterious Four (Theo James).  This movie seems like one people either really love or really hate, and if so I'd lean toward the former; shutting off my brain, I just enjoyed the ride, finding it much more entertaining and involving than, say, the oft-compared The Hunger Games, particularly with Woodley in the lead.  I guess one good sign I liked it: I bought the book almost immediately after watching the film",1409529600,,1062,4.760869565217392

6102612,4,B00GQQ77IU,"The story is similar to the book. Society is divided into 5 categories and human nature with the need to control power produces a megalomaniac taking advantage of the security faction to overthrow the government faction with the typical heroine and hero take down the bad guy. The acting is decent with the characters well portrayed. Four was solid throughout. Tris did better with action and excitement and was not completely believable in the sad emotive scenes such as her mother's death. The film is very action oriented.

Although I am a big science fiction fan, I didn't feel the need to buy the books. This movie is good entertainment but I do not feel the need to own it either. Something in this series just did not hit the mark for me. Nothing felt ""new"" about this story.

Maybe I was hoping it could give the Hunger Games a grand run for the money, but it disappointingly fell short. I so wanted it to be awesome and it just was mediocre. Sorry Divergent.

One of the requirements is that I could probably watch it tomorrow and still enjoy it, and again within six months.  I have no doubt that's the case with ""Divergent"". I watched it alone, but probably would have enjoyed it even more with family.
Other movies that fit this category were some that have already been mentioned, ""The Hobbit"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, both ""The Hunger Games"", both recent ""Star Wars"", and a very few others.
Those giving ratings of three stars or less must just not like this genre, or are just too critical.
It may have had a similar story line as ""The Hunger Games"" and some other movies, yet it was vastly different, definitely enough to hold it's own.
Similarities are the young heroine and factions/castes.  However, the caste system is far different than what is seen in the ""The Hunger Games"".  And almost everyone is satisfied with the faction they're with.
I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the ""The Hunger Games"".",1409443200,,1047,4.7103825136612025

The actors lived it and I had several remember able lines that was stand stood out for me, if I can use that word. ""What make you think you can talk to me."" Well delivered by the actor.

If you are under 25, you'll likely thoroughly enjoy the this post-apocalyptic fantasy world that features characters you can cheer for and perhaps relate to. If you are over that age, you may still find the whole movie charmingly naive escapism...or not....The person who wrote it, is undoubtedly in the age range of the movie characters, so I don't want to chastise the movie TOO bad. Some of the hilariously goofy movie premises I though were 'awesome' and 'kick-ass' when I was in my early 20's, I look back at and laugh at their sheer sillininess of today. Fun escapism, as long as you don't hold the movie up to the scrutiny of anything to the 'would this really happen' magnifying glass of plausibility (for which the premise and 95% of the movie is so ridiculous you would need to shut off that part of your brain to enjoy it).",1409443200,,873,4.602564102564102

6102632,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent
 The Twilight films and then the Hunger Games series has set off a run of adventure films with teen age girls as the protagonist.  The producers are hoping for an out of the park hit with a new billion dollar franchise.  Along the way to the bank they sometimes make something that people want to see, to trade their hard earned cash of a couple of hours of solid entertainment.  Divergent fits the bill on all marks.  It has a story we can follow and a cast of young actors that we can enjoy watching.
 In the future, 100 years after the war is as close as a date that we have, the city of Chicago evolves into an isolated island of sanity and civilization.  We don't know what goes on outside of the city, but there is a gigantic wall to keep whatever it is out and the people in.
 The society within the enclave of order and peace involves elements of great virtue.  Five casts dominate the social order, each with a particular function and personality.  The Dauntless clan protects the society from internal disorder and from nameless outside enemies.  Peace loving Amity sings and grows vegetables.  Erudite thinks about things and figures out the solutions to societys problems.  Candor runs the courts with hard edged truth telling.  Abnegation, the selfless do-gooders, is deemed moral enough to form the government and administration.  There are outcasts, homeless, hopeless bums who live precariously beyond the boundaries of the five groups.
 At 16 youngsters choose a clan, a choice that is irreversible and lifelong.  Naturally, this cannot bring anything but squashed dreams and rigid government enforced conformity.  The goal of this set up is order rather than the expansion and exultation of the human spirit.
  Divergent puts the action in some distant future so criticisms of historical accuracy do not appertain.  What quibbles we have with the fantasy/reality tension disappear in the fast passed narrative and the charm of the characters, particularly Tris, the young girl at the center of things.
 16 year old Tris is played by 23 year old Sharlene Woodley.  Viewers will remember her from many TV roles and especially in her portrayal of the younger daughter in Descendents, the recent saga of the Hawaiian dynasty staring George Clooney.  Even at 23 she can stand close

ups with no apparent make up.  She is believable as a fresh faced 16 years old.  She will continue her role as Tris in the next two episodes which are already in various stages of production.
 He co-star in Englishman Theo James as an older fellow named Four.  I saw him in a small but perfectly executed role in Downton Abbey, the immensely popular TV show.  The handsome 30 year old once said I know I often get a job because of how I look.  I hope that I keep the job because of how I act.  He can act, as he proved in Downton Abbery.  He is not asked to do so in Divergent which is a shameful waste of talent.  He is tasked with looking good (or yummy in the lexicon of the teen age girls that form the core demographic for the audience) and frowning to indicate various degrees of concern.
 Ashley Judd plays Tris mom.  The best acting nod goes to Kate Wisnlet in her role as the evil leader of the Erudite faction.  Also watch for Zoe Kravitz as one of Tris gal pals.  Kravitz is the offspring of singer Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet.  Her beautiful parents blessed her with wonderful features.
 Novelist Veronica Roth is only 26 years old.  The three books in the Divergent series have sold in excess of five million copies to date.  Her target for the young adult novels is the demographic that begins at age 12 and continues through high school.  She knows what her audience wants and just how to give it to them.  The translation to the silver screen succeeds in spades.
 There is a deft undertone in the work about Teen Alienation that the movie brushes over lightly but definitely.  The five groups might easily be compared to the High School clans of Jocks, Hippies, Brainiaks and so on.  In one scene, a chemical induced nightmare, young Tris is shown separated from the other kids by an actual glass barrier, a symbol of the eternal yearning of young people to belong and fit in and the panic inducing sense of being outside the herd.  I thought is a nice metaphor, done quickly and without fanfare.
 Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor adapted Veronica Roths novel to the big screen.  Daugherty is best known for his script for Snow White and the Huntsman.  That film attained a spectacular success and his negotiating skill garnered Daugherty a stunning $3.2 million writing fee.  Taylor penned the touching and also successful look at middle age marriage Hope Springs.
 Director Neil Burger exercises himself in Divergent and makes a craftwork film with interesting shots and techniques.  He leaves out any movie magic moments that might interfere

with the story.  Sometimes a director cannot help himself and allows the direction to become the focus of the film.  Not here, Burger keeps the audience fixed on the story, not fancy director stuff.  He also directed Limitless and The Illusionist.  Both of his best known films received good marks artistically.  Both gathered the monetary devotion of satisfied watchers.
 Divergent is on the road to a smashing box office success with a strong opening weekend domestic gate of $56 million on a budget of $85 million.  The strong three saw blade film is properly rated PG-13 for some violence.  The actors utter no bad words and while the youngsters smooch, they manage to stop there.  You get your moneys worth time wise with this two hour and 23 minute movie.  Most people will enjoy this film, especially the young teens but parents and grandparents will also like it.
 Fun Fact-Kate Wisnlet filmed her scenes while she was five months into her pregnancy.  Director Burger used his subtle director tricks to hide the bump.",1409443200,,5903,4.733791748526523

No big-time impressions on any level. Sets and story are humble.
The end comes about in war. Although everlasting peace is a fine ideal, in reality it is elusive and war as the prelude to periods of peace.
Reworking and shedding of skins are eternal necessity. Study history and NOT the rewritten Lib Agenda Version being taught too often in every media form and every public school.

6102650,3,B00GQQ77IU,"While it's not a ""bad"" movie, it is realistically just another ""oh look how cool my computer effects guys are"" movie.  The story concept is interesting, and had a lot of potential; however, the actual story treatment in this movie left a lot of holes and implausibility.  My wife and I paused several times to say ""huh?  Didn't they say something else before?"" or ""now in a society like this how would what they just did even be possible?""  I mean not at the end, but all through the movie, it contradicts itself and really is incoherent... and leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.  That said, it is a visually stunning movie.  Though probably 98% of the sets and background in this film are obviously computer generated, which although sad is the lazy movie maker norm in this time, it is very well done.  It looks nice, there isn't pixelated poorly rendered distant background, the lighting an shadows are kept consistent with one another and the environment is imaginative and realistic at the same time.  The acting is pretty good as a whole, they cast all the parts very well (though Ashley Judd is a serious disappointment) and no one seemed to be phoning it in for once.

In the grand scheme of things I'd say this:  Did I enjoy it?  Yes.  For what it is, it was entertaining.  Would I watch it again?  NO.  It was sloppily written, and no matter how pretty it is to watch, how 'cool' the effects seem to be, the story sucks and I won't subject myself to that again.",1409443200,,1483,4.481343283582089

6102652,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I hope the book is better than the movie. The movie does not sufficiently establish the reasons for the existence of the factions system. It is presented pretty much as a given - sort of the way that the paper money system is blindly accepted by most people in the world. The reason for the existence of a ""factionless"" group is not established at all. It merely seems an arbitrary cruelty. The villains in the movie are cardboard comic-book cutouts. They are presented as evil psychotics lacking in any real motivation for their actions other than the typical lust for power over others. I suspect the book goes into much greater depth. I hope so.

All that said, it was obvious to me that certain factions represented political groupings or groupings of people in the U.S. The abnegates are obviously the social idealists, which in the United States means liberals. Other countries which have an actual left would include social democrats and socialists. The erudites gave me the impression of being libertarians who want to hack the state down to a tiny size so as to give unfettered freedom to business owners. The factionless obviously represent the homeless. I'm quite sure that the book is a political allegory. The movie, however, is so shallow that the allegory is just barely visible.

All things considered, Divergent (the movie) makes ""The Hunger Games"" (movies) look downright deep and intellectual. I wish I had bought the book instead of the movie.",1409356800,,1463,4.895161290322581

6102660,4,B00GQQ77IU,"One thing is certain when it comes to movies being made in Hollywood. If it's at all possible any movie made will come down to marketability and the chance to spin it off into a series if at all possible. Now when someone can find a series of books to turn into movies it just makes that so much better for them. Does it mean movie goers will get something special? Well, some times yes and some times no. The first two major franchises in the teen/action genre, TWILIGHT and HUNGER GAMES, have both been pretty good. But what about DIVERGENT?

After the great wars things changed and people were segregated into five factions, groups that all contribute to the greater good of the whole by performing tasks set for each faction. Abnegation believes in public service for the greater good and taking care of others. Erudite are the intelligent group built upon knowledge. Amity is the peaceful group that takes care of food. Candor handles legal matters and deals with total honesty. Lastly is Dauntless, the warriors and protectors of the whole. There is actually a sixth group, Factionless, composed of people who fit into no group.

Shailene Woodley stars as Tris, a teenager in the future living in this world, what is left of Chicago. Her family is part of the Abnegation faction but she dreams of being in Dauntless. As teens reach a certain age they are tested to see what faction they naturally belong in. The woman giving Tris her tests is stunned at the results and tells her to let no one know what they were. Tris is divergent, meaning she possesses skills in all five groups and is considered dangerous to society.

When the chance to choose arises, Tris picks Dauntless and begins life as a trainee in the group. The challenges they go through are incredibly physical and demanding but she carries on. She catches the attention of two very different leaders: Four (Theo James) who attempts to help in her training and Eric (Jai Courtney), the main leader of the band who tries to find ways to eliminate her when she displays leadership skills that might one day rival his own.

The storyline here runs down two paths, the first being the training of Tris and her trying to hide what her true nature is. To show she has too much aptitude would be to reveal herself but if she doesn't make the cut when the final test comes about, she could be eliminated altogether and sent out into the Factionless group. The second story line runs alongside this one with the Erudite planning something big that is revealed near the last 45 minutes of the film. I won't spoil it by letting you know what that is. How Tris handles both paths as they converge into one makes for much of the drama here. How she handles Four and falls for him inserts the romance that these teen franchises crave.

So does it hold up in the long run? I would say yes it does. The movie offers and entertaining action film in a world of the future. Like both TWILIGHT and HUNGER GAMES it features young people in roles once populated by middle aged males. Instead the action becomes theirs as do the romances between characters. With teens making up the major portion of the movie going audience this should make it a guarantee to fill seats. But don't let that prevent older movie lovers from enjoying this film as well. It delivers the goods from start to finish and you'll find yourself cheering for Tris before the end of the movie.

While I sometimes think the whole concept of franchise films has potential the fear that Hollywood will exclude anything else remains. Thankfully the star of this film, Woodley, has been given several great roles in the past few years including starring in THE FAULR OF OUR STARS and THE DESCENDANTS. It shows that there is some faith in her ability to not only star in a series but in independent storylines as well. As long as that continues I'm all for the franchises to carry on. With three more movies already in the works for this series I'm sure we'll be able to see what happens down the road.",1409356800,,4016,4.563106796116505

6102665,1,B00GQQ77IU,"I think you can tell how good this was by the speed with which it went to Netflix, Amazon, video, etc.. I know I wish I had the two hours of my life back that I wasted watching this video. Like David Letterman used to say, ""People Are Hungry For Entertainment,"" and they must be. Poor character development, acting talent that was nonexistent, and a story? who knows. I think the writers were trying to develop something of a  Hunger Games theme, but they appear to have missed the mark badly. And, there wasn't anyone with the strength of a Jennifer Lawrence to carry this story.

Obviously, this movie must have appealed to someone, maybe the Young Adult market. However, I think that what this story lacks is the breadth of appeal that the Hunger Games had, it drew you in. This was too focused on the YA market, it lacked convincing execution and did not have the complexity to draw in a more mature audience. Of course this is why I recognize it as a ""copy of"", an ""imitation of"", a ""knock-off of"". I know I won't be viewing part II, that is if there is a part II, but I'm pretty sure there will be.",1409356800,4,1104,4.328502415458937

Many performers seem to do well with their parts,but I just couldn't bring myself to like hers as she wasn't convincing enough.

6102780,1,B00GQQ77IU,"Far more boring than the trailers would have you believe, this film/storyline is just another weak attempt to break into the wildly popular and lucrative young adult market. The main character is essentially a two dimensional caricature of other popular teenage heroines, and every plot point is painfully predictable. The soundtrack is a laughable trainwreck with poorly chosen songs so terribly synced to the story that it really pulls attention from the rest of the film. I haven't seen much of the lead actress (Shailene Woodley) in her other roles, but her performance in Divergent was surface level and boring though in all fairness, her character ""Tris"" doesn't give her much to work with. Of course, the real problem lies in the completely idiocy of the underlying premise of this world. The social structure of the world is ludicrous at best and so unbelievable that I find it hard to see how there could possibly be more than one book/movie set in it. I'm guessing this trilogy was a big hit with Twilight fans, but everyone else, save your money for something with at least a bit more substance...or at least something more entertaining.",1409011200,8,1148,4.922680412371134

6102782,2,B00GQQ77IU,"So here we have another teenage girl movie in which the heroine is the only one who can save the world.  Very little back story is presented so the motivations of the characters are hard to discern.  All of these movies are becoming repetitive.  This was a great concept when you had a good actress like Sigourney Weaver in a good movie, but Shailenes' acting is average.  This movie is too slow in its build up which robs the audience of the suspenseful ending.  Aside from the lack of suspense, there plot holes a truck could drive through.
The plot is basic at best. I spent the movie trying to guess what would happen and when. I could guess what would happen before it happened.  I suppose if you have not seen dozens of movies like this one you would be entertained.  I however found the movie boring.  The only thing I am happy about is that I did not find myself divergent of money by watching this a a theater.",1409011200,,919,4.333333333333333

6102807,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This movie described a highly structured, communistic world of a future dystopia.  I think the movie is directed mainly toward a young audience, but it also has some points of interest to contemplate for people who are older than teenagers, or outside the 20 - 30 age bracket.  Neuroscience in this future is extraordinarily advanced, and is used to place young people in the available groupings, the ""factions"" (which are not ranked hierarchically), that make up this society.  Despite the knowledge of the particular ""breed"" of person, and such extraordinary ability to select for a young person's life, after testing, the young adult is still permitted to select for his or her group, which is usually the group defined by the test.  The test also identifies, to some extent, what are called the ""divergent"".  The ""divergent"", the people who can adapt and survive, and receive the benefits of a culture's resources in bringing them to adulthood, but who do not fit, are a serious threat in this structured, closed world.  Why?  It is a question that I believe applies not only to this fantasy world, but to the broader world of reality.  What makes the ""different"", the ""individual"", a threat for the group hives we humans create?  In this movie, part of the answer is pretty obvious, but partly it leaves us with something to ponder.  I read some of the serious criticisms of this movie, and they seem to miss the point a bit, although some criticisms have merit.  The movie is a bit too flawed to warrant five stars.",1408924800,,1521,4.789272030651341

6102810,1,B00GQQ77IU,"Apparently, teen novel adaptations are all the rage right now.  This year alone we have the first part of the conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy (or is it a quadruplet or some other made up word like that?) as well as films like The Giver and The Maze Runner and earlier this year everyone went crazy (or at least a bunch of teenage girls did) when Jennifer Lawrence 2.0 (a.k.a. Shailene Woodley) starred in the big screen adaptation of Divergent.  I initially had no desire to see this, considering that I kind of loathe Woodley as an actress, but I used to hate Jennifer Lawrence too, and The Hunger Games was partly to blame for my shift in opinion of her.

Beside, this also stars Kate Winslet, and Ive been in love with her since forever so Ill stoop to watching just about anything in order to see her school everyone around her.

Its a shame that Divergent is a ridiculous, lazy, halfhearted, underdeveloped and over stylized absolute mess of a film, because it had the makings of something that could have been halfway decent and yet, well, this was outright awful.

I have so many issues with this film that Im not even sure where I should begin.  I felt almost ashamed to be hating every second of this film, because I was in a room with my best friend and his wife and my wife and his brother and his brothers wife and they were all kind of glued to the screen and loving this movie and I was hiding in the corner of the couch Tweeting about how awful this movie was.  I mean, I had this awkward smile on my face the entire film because I couldn't for the life of me understand how anyone could find this remotely entertaining in a serious fashion.

It was comical in its depiction of teen life and almost reminded me of a modern-day set Nicholas Sparks adaptation (because he just CANNOT write for modern culture).  It all feels so put on and overtly obvious.  The depiction of the Dauntless felt so early 90s, but not in a good way.  Think Hook and then laugh because they are serious with this mess.  I also couldn't really care much for the films description of futuristic life and those factions mostly because it felt so Hunger Games lite.  Like, weve seen all of this before done much better, and while I cant say that The Hunger Games is a relatively smart piece of literature (because, well, come on), the film (and the novel, to a degree) understands the absurdity and uses it as an advantage, dissecting it in order to present a near satire at current pop culture.  Divergent is almost too serious minded to be taken seriously as much of anything, and it is so stale in its presentation, thanks to an absolutely lifeless performance by Woodley.

I wanted to shoot myself about three minutes in while Woodley was talking at me, explaining what her world was like.

I don't care.

Shut up.

Please turn this off.

The production values aren't any better, really.  I mean, so much of this was so obviously shot against a green screen that it becomes awkward to watch (that train jumping scene, both of them, were just preposterous and ugly to watch).  No one is remotely interesting, and the pointless backstory created feels wasted on this film.  I understand that this is the beginning of yet another trilogy, but at least give us something to care about here.  Instead, we have visions of beatings that aren't explored and a family that feels divided almost immediately, for no reason presented at all.  It doesnt help that the only performance here with any real life is Miles Teller, who has a thankless bully role and is pretty much abandoned halfway through only to get a small shot at more screen time in the end.

Winslet does fine here, truly, but her villain couldn't be more bland.

I guess that is the bottom-line here; this movie (story, book, whatever) is so incredibly bland.  There isn't anything interesting at play here.  The story feels borrowed, heavily.  The ideas feel marginally developed, with no real spice or detail.  The characters are one note and disengaged.  The performances are a bore, the music is so horribly overplayed and overbearing (like, SHUT THAT MUSIC OFF, PLEASE!) and the finale is so swift it feels horribly lazy and almost rushed.

Another real issue I have here is the amount of time it takes to get to the point.  This is probably the films largest downfall, because by the time we actually get to the actual Divergent issue, weve already checked out.  Who cares?  Whos still paying attention?  I wasnt, or at least I wish I wasnt.  I mean, I understand that this is building a foundation for more films to come, but taking over an hour to get to the meat of the story was wasted celluloid and created content that felt like filler, and if your film is filled with 50% filler then you have a real problem.",1408924800,,4776,4.530921820303384

The 'fear tests' which supposedly are so important to the film have absolutely no bearing to the rest of the plot and seem like they are inserted just to make the movie longer. the acting is pretty good, but the disjointed plot line makes everything else pointless. I don't think I can recommend the movie even as a way to way to pass the time when there's nothing else to watch: it simply is mediocre and not worth your time.",1408838400,,462,4.383720930232558

My wife actually liked this, even though she isn't a big Sci Fi fan. Going by the positive comments, most are from females. So maybe it's more a lady film than for guys.
Acting and story line was starving for more and pretty weak.
Originality? Hunger Games beat this one to the punch and was more exciting.

I'm just glad I got this one on Amazon for $4.99 in HD rather than Comcast's $6.99 HD version.

6102897,3,B00GQQ77IU,"The film is ok.  Having not read the books prior (Seeing the film before reading the book lets me not be prejudiced against the film because of the way the screenwriter opted to adapt the story)

First the bad.  The film starts off painfully slow with a lot of character development some of it useful, but there's a lot of padding.  Finally the plot starts to unfold and lead character selects her faction.  But then we stop again with overkill in the character development department.  Again the plot seems to start moving forward and the challenges and threats start.  Finally the lead is accepted by her faction and things start to happen  but alas we now spend a good amount of time on fight scenes.  The film finally finishes, but is left obviously open for a sequel.

6102899,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Theres no way to avoid a comparison to Hunger Games, so here it is: I consider the ""Divergent Trilogy"" to be a strong runner-up to the ""Hunger Games Trilogy"" -- they have many similarities and both envision a dystopic, distant-future United States with highly factionalized populations.  The Hunger Games movies are extremely well done with phenomenal young and adult actors.  Similarly, the Divergent film has been casted and produced very well, however the story is just not quite as strong as the Hunger Games (in my opinion).  Thus, like the books, Divergent was a strong 2nd place to the original Hunger Games movie.  Even still, it was very good and I really, really enjoyed it!  Definitely recommended for fans of the dystopian/sci-fi genre and/or fans of the books",1408838400,,772,5.0

Why did the 'police' or 'enforcers' or whatever they called themselves act like a bunch of hooligans running and jumping and screaming through the streets? Why did the heroine pick them to become a member of their sect? What was the role of the divergents except to look miserable old and dirty?

They didn't even try to build character relationships or develop any sense of reality. Please watch Hunger Games if you want to enjoy a movie of this theme.  I do feel bad for one actor that plays Four. He made it at least passable to the end as eye candy. Save yourself and your money. Keep scrolling. Don't fall for it.",1408579200,5,638,4.361344537815126

6102963,2,B00GQQ77IU,I don't usually do reviews but having read the book I felt compelled to provide one.  The movie left out several key parts that are instrumental to character development.

6102967,2,B00GQQ77IU,"Monstrously incomplete and totally boring 3/4 of the way through. I literally didn't finish watching it. How does a society divided up into values keep the peace when it so obviously would end up in conflict? Why did the main character pick the warrior caste (the movie makes it appear to be pure caprice...which I doubt). Would anybody seriously believe that a caste based on goodness and simple values is orchestrating large-scale theft of resources successfully? And how do you pick the bad guy these days? They either have a heavy accent, or they are affluent and attractive. Good guys wear jeans, skimpy tops, and have tattoos.

No, I didn't read the book, and I get that many of these questions may have been less annoying if I had. But I don't think that's acceptable as a reason; I know a lot of people that never read The Lord of the Rings and loved all three movies. I didn't read the Hunger Games and thought the movie was decent, in fact I watched it twice.

6102971,3,B00GQQ77IU,"This movie is ok. The beginning is the most interesting, but like many of the now-day ""ADHD"" type movies it begins good and starts to move too fast and leaves the viewer to put the pieces together in your own mind. ""ADHD"" type movies = any and all movies that just jump through the motions and force the viewer to rely on previously produced films and / or your own imagination to put the sequences together. Like the mind of someone who's hyperactive - they seem to think that you are connected with their thoughts with some magical mind link and you just naturally know what's happening without actually seeing and experiencing the actions and sequences in the movie. It's like the producers are saying to themselves ""Cut ! We've all seen this in 100 other movies, the audience will figure it out... let's just shoot the next scene.""

6102981,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Better book adaptation than most.  No blatantly poor acting.  Smarter than the targeted audience expects.  The music is entertaining without being harsh or dull, particularly during the end credits.  Also appealing is the lack of gratuitous cursing, nakedness and sex which the vocal sci-fi crowd demands of every production.  Every once in a while a sci-fi film comes out which attempts to tell a story with characterization rather than effects, and this is one of them.  This is often because the budget could not afford it, but in this case, it's because the characters and story are strong enough without the lavish effects.  While the story concepts are admittedly well worn in this genre, the book author's slant using a multi-caste social system with strongly divided lines allows a little wiggle room to explore two castes which are forced out to live in scorn or distrust; the ""factionless"" and the ""divergents.""  School age viewers will identify with the clique parallels.  Most will identify with the risks associated with departing from social expectations.

Was a fun movie I love Four perfectly cast although Tris not so much would it destroy Hollywood to put a strong woman in a roll, she seems too girly to be Tris.  And Eric was not sceevey enough he was just brutal the book character was deeper.

If I was them, that is where I'd go.  I guess they will have to make a sequel and take us outside the wall.  Anyway, I'm divergent for sure as I totally relate and do not conform.  I enjoyed this movie. It was a little bit of a call for us to wake up a little to what too much government can do to a society... especially a corrupt one.  Where power is desired, there is nothing the evil in a human won't do.  I can see America becoming like this if the people don't take it back and remind our government in America that they work for us.  Good reminders.  Good running theme.  A lot to think about and to discuss.  It is one that will have you thinking for a few days after watching it.  I hope you enjoy it too.

This is young adult fiction about a dystopian future, so don't expect sophisticated drama.  On the other hand, it had pretty good character development and dialog.  The story is well adapted from the book -- mostly what is left out isn't missed. (I do wonder if someone who did not read the book would ""get it"" quite the same way we did, since we knew the backstory.)  The plot is solid and the story has very few gimmicks or loose ends.

The actors don't really act, it's as if they all are reading from a script in rehearsal.  The writers took too long to get to what the movie was about, horrible acting.  The movie is unnecessarily long, drawn out, uninteresting and boring.  The advertising and trailers hype up the movie.  If you've seen Transcendence and Lucy, it's all the same premise.

Your no-talent, failed attempt speaks for itself. Leave the movie making to the professionals. Give up your egos and go back to your day jobs. Or maybe you just have too much money and nothing else to do? Please do it somewhere else.

Divergent was a great read, lots of action, moral questions, great characters, a story that you wanted more of when you reached the end.  I was afraid the'y'd change it too much for the movie, but mostly, they stuck to the story and picked some of the greatest scenes for the movie.

But in the bond movies, the reason was out of respect and because this is hollywood.  In this move, the 'hollywood' excuse just isn't enough and its really so bad that it ruined the whole movie for me.  Not that that's the only problem.  The concept was good enough that it deserved a little more reasonable plot.  The screenwriter and director should have thought more about it.

In fact, it basically IS the hunger games with different names.  Same futuristic society with completely unbelievable social rules, same plucky young woman who is somehow supposed to be special, same sexual-tension-but-chaste-hugs-only... if you're a Twilight fan it might be insipid enough for you.  Apallingly crappy acting, zero budget, insane confusing plot filled with inconsistencies and loopholes, a warrior caste that plays wargames with razor darts but no goggles....

6103196,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Maybe it was because the movie followed what I remembered of the book well enough that I just wasn't surprised by anything, or maybe it was too slow.  Or both.  I do remember the book feeling very exciting, and the movie somehow doesn't bring that across.

Unfortunately it tries to liven things up by mimicking Twilight's style of adding pop music to scenes that really don't need it (e.g., eating in the cafeteria). It was distracting to such a point that I'd turn to my husband and ask if one of the characters had turned on a radio and I missed it.  And Tris just doesn't come across as the strong person the book portrays her as.

Seeing the movie did make the book's story seem more juvenile to me too and reaffirmed the fact that I don't care to read the rest of the series: She's special; she can't be put in a category like these other dopes! Dauntless is crazy-- they get tattoos and zipline! etc.

I can't say the acting was terrible (not great, but not terrible), and there was nothing about it that was egregious, so I give it a 2.75. I can't quite bring myself to give it a full 3.",1408147200,,1095,4.29126213592233

A big issue for me is the setting, if this post-apocalyptic war, how is it possible that everyone resides in one location--or why?  Also there is a subway train that run through throughout the city, yet its only used by the d-people who wear black.  And the train runs conveniently whenever the plot calls for it. Plus the strength of the leading woman is pretty exaggerated, especially given the un-athletic physique of the actress.

If you are in the mood for a couple hours of mindless child-coming -of-age in a FM antenna filled Chicago hell hole then this is your flick. I, on the other hand, would prefer that you instead dedicate those 2 hours to developing a mind erase devise, which I can then use to ""divert"" this movie from my memory banks.

6103314,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Hunger Games inspired, glossy-magazine-model-cast, modern-contemporary-furnished apocalyptic future not far from now.
Good fun, albeit a bit too ""perfect"" in some ways. For example all the factions had tailored designer clothing, a dystopian future beset with G-Star clad ""Dauntless"" in matching outfits, including the Derelicte inspired factionless. I wish that there were more people with scars; a bit more ""gruff"" and ""real"". It's reminiscent of the latest Star Trek movie series in its overly-polished squeaky-clean appearance. In fact, it should just be called Detergent since there is not one iota of dirt on any clothing other than the stage-dirty Derelicte factionless. The only thing that diverged was my interest and the movie at various intervals.

The story line is fairly similar to the Hunger Games female lead's journey to self-discovery and resistance to the system which holds society in a dystopian, fascist lock-down. It's an easy-on-the-eyes watch which is enjoyable as long as you don't expect any intellectual prodding from its plot.

6103324,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I am a fan of science fiction and some fantasy so it is not too surprising that I was intrigued by this movie. I had first rented the movie and then watched it three times during the rental period; I have now ordered the Blu-ray and the entire series of books including ""Four"" so this will suggest my level of enthusiasm for the story. I am also a fan of ""The Hunger Games"" series and have read those books many times.

As I watched the movie for the second and third times I began to see some interesting parallels between the story and the situation in the United States today; I wonder if the similarities are intentional or coincidental; it is something to ponder.

The general outline of the story is a post-apocalyptic society located in what had been Chicago and has become an isolated community divided into five factions. ""Factions over blood"" has become the standard to which all should adhere. The heroine of the story is a young girl, Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, who encounters a dangerous problem with which she is compelled to deal.

The movie is well paced and never failed to hold my interest as Tris meets the challenges that are thrown at her. The characters are sympathetic and the viewer can develop a concern for their well being as the story progresses.

There are four novels about the ""Divergent"" world and chronologically this is the second in the series. Based on the success of this first movie it is likely others will follow.",1407974400,,1460,4.6038461538461535

I'm indifferent to the Hunger Games- didn't like the first movie and didn't care enough about the plight of the people to see the sequel. And I tried watching the other YA adaptations in between but it all sucked as well. I'm probably not their demo anyways at the ripe old age of 30ish!!  Lol! Anywho, I enjoyed it much more than I expected ( lowered expectation usually yields above average rating!) Tris started out a little meek but through out the movie she became a stronger person - both physically and emotionally. I like movies with character arcs that show growth, so it was nice to see that in this movie. Also, Four was a strong counterpart to Tris - he was intelligent, strong, and capable as well. It's always good to the see both male and female leads be equals. The story was fast paced but interesting, although not really new ides but it still felt fresh.  The only issue I really had was the abrupt ending - but I supposed that is the pitfall of trilogies.",1407974400,2,1087,4.457286432160804

6103353,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Tris in the book was strong and opinionated to a fault. She talked to much,  was proud and stubborn. The Tris in the movie makes me want to cry. She was weak. She had no fire, no substance, no depth, she was just weak(didnt I just say that). I didn't feel this was until I read the book.  I blame the director, this was poor directing at its best.  Shailene's acting in the movie had no variation- maybe there is a technical term for that, I don't know, but this is the directors fault.  I loved the actor who played Will, he was funny. The actress who played Christina did good, as well as the guy who played Eric. Theo James did good as well. I just thought the director failed to capture the essence of the book.

I also blame myself. I watched the movie-absolutely loved it. Purchased the movie. Then I messed up. I read the book. The book was wonderful in every way, but it made me change how I felt about the movie. The relationship between Tris and Four was so wonderfully intense. The movie failed to show just how much they were endeared to each other. Movies are not like books I get it, but the director missed the mark on this one. It wasn't that he did not put in certain scenes, understandable, but he failed to show the depth of their relationship and feelings for each other-just in this book. Maybe the second director will do better",1407888000,,1350,4.299212598425197

It was a very good adaptation and a lot of people giving it bad ratings probably haven't read the books to even remotely understand the story. The romance is not overbearing or sappy like most new books and the movie does the book justice! Would I have liked more detail in the movie? Of course!

Slow at times, but still intriguing. Very fine sets, costumes and special effects. Shailene Woodley does a decent job (much better that Stewart in the Twilight series, and she certainly has more depth!) Theo James...well,.. I don't see what all the fuss is about.

As always the book is better but usually that has more to do with being in the character's head instead of watching someone portray what was in the characters head. We only get about half of it. I did like how you could see the strength of Tris portrayed by Shailene. She really did have a way of demonstrating her conflict between trying to make people happy by conforming to what was expected of her and her inner strength. And Four... well let's just say he is the reason I bought the movie. He' the perfect bad boy - but not really - character.

The movie lacked the on the edge of your seat tension the book had. I think that is because it was a little 2-dimensional compared to the book which had many sub-plots going on and interactions between Tris and many of the other characters.",1407888000,,809,4.322368421052632

6103442,3,B00GQQ77IU,"It was alright the bit that I saw, I did not read the book buy my girlfriend did. She fell asleep 1/2 through it, so what does that tell you.

But It was very close concept to the hunger games, I feel if the story was stronger and was not ""competing"" with the hunger games style of Factions. The actors are alright, the main character is the only one you like, and the rest of the cast are %#@# and you could give a rats butt if they all just died.

You could tell it was a low budget film. Wait it had a higher budget than the first Hunger Games (Sad). In comparison to the other large book franchise such as LoTR and Harry Potter, its is about on the same level of Hunger Games and had over 12 million more to spend. Witch makes it even more irritating because it was not any better, I hate comparing the Hunger Games to Divergent because they are not all all similar, its not a group of teenagers killing each other (nice roll models there) its groups of people that are ""segregated"" into 5 groups and the 6th group are the Faction'less. And then there are those

SPOILER: STOP READING. That are Divergent, witch in the English language dictionary means: tending to be different or develop in different directions. So in this story some people 'don't fit in"" with just one Faction. SPOILER OVER.

The Story Just drags on and on. Its one of those movies you might watch bits and parts of if your flicking through the TV or it pops up in Amazon Prime, or Netflix and you have nothing else to watch. I would give it a 2.5 Star.

But eventually I had to shut if off because of the way they fight. What? Yes The way they fought. As a Mixed Martial Artist I could not stand there hand to hand combat scenes in the movie. From stance to execution. Lets just say I am glad they kept punching each other in the face because your not going to block anything with your arms crossed.

The way society was portrayed didn't seem viable; what purpose did having 20% of the population be ""candor""? Speaking the truth doesn't seem like an occupation, they didn't seem to have any connection with the government. Who manned the stores, picked up the trash, who were the doctors? Being ex military the training seemed very wasteful in that 20% of all recruits had to fail and be thrown out in the waste pile on non factions? What society can afford to waste so many young adults? Too much of the movie was spent on brutal training that didn't add anything to team work and seemed destined to kill some of the recruits. There was no explanation about why the Mom changed factions, why the brother selected a different faction, the movie didn't make any sense.",1407801600,7,915,4.414201183431953

I usually don't like compare them anyway, as you can never make a movie from a book and be, ""verbatim."" The acting overall was good, not excellent, but good. The 'adults' -if you will- roles did seem to be a bit hesitant and shallow. It's hard to explain - I just didn't see a lot of depth of character in the parental-type figures.

As far as the ebb and flow of the film, there seemed to be more ambling than any kind of real momentum. It wasn't just the absence of true 'action' scenes like you'd think there would be, but just a lack of real momentum in the story. I was never really sure what kept the storyline moving forward. Without discussing in detail each scene or character, I'll just say there was a whole lot of answered 'whys"" to character actions, societal and cultural portrayals, and, for me, a huge 'why' about the reasons for one faction to suddenly become so militant and 'evil.' I know the movie gave reasons, they just didn't make sense and certainly didn't have enough back-story to explain the explanation.

In conclusion, I was glad I only rented the movie. I realized this when I clicked on the movie to see how much was left to watch and despaired that I still had over an hour to go before it ended.  Here's to hoping any sequel has more movement and reasoning to it.",1407801600,,1372,4.3515625

What a great role model Shailene is...she is pretty, but not perfect...how refreshing to see a non plastic person (young or old) on screen. The casting of this movie is flawless...well except for Mekhi Phifer...nonessential role that did not call for a well known actor.

If I were a pre-teen girl or Twilight mom, I'd probably love this.

 The second part was utterly disappointing because how can you be a heroine if everyone has to save you? Second act is pretty much summed up by zombie soldiers, people around Tris dying and her loverboy, and her parents coming to the rescue.

While the digital version have some really nice extras, with interviews and commentary,  the dvd comes with very few interesting extras. The only part worth watching was the deleted scenes. Everything else was very underwhelming. While I love the movie and for that alone it's worth for me to buy it, had I known what the extras would be, I would have stick to just the digital version. I heard thw blu ray format has some nicer extras. I don't have a blu ray player so I can't attest to that.

Ender's Game was good and heck, even Twilight was at least entertaining to watch with my kids. The problem with this movie is that it just didn't make any sense. Why would anyone fit into one category of personality unless they were genetically modified to do so? The story just isn't plausible, which made it very difficult to watch especially since I think it is categorized as a drama, I can't really put it in the sci-fi genre. The story had too many holes and was not that entertaining. I love fantasy but the plot in this one was just stupid, I rather watch gentlemen broncos if I want to see dramatic silliness.

It was very predictable, it tries to force a love story that it doesn't need, female heroine that is special from everyone else, separated from parents and must grow up quick.  These movies are metaphors for going to college.  The film was still watchable, i finished the 3 hours but halfway through i felt dissapointed with the direction the plot was going.  The worst thing about this movie is that its 3 hours long but doesnt have anything realistic about it to get you into it.  Example would be everyone lives in a grungy bunker with no showers but everyone has perfect hair, notably the girl, seriously you will notice how good her hair looks to the point its distracting.  A sci-fi or action movie should be over the top unbelievable and hour n a half long or believable at 2+ hours.

Neither the story which was too long, you could get rid of half, and it would lose little. The characters had little  interest to me.

It was one of those books where the end was so convoluted and rushed that it not only felt like an after thought but made me wonder if the same author even wrote the ending. I kept thinking that the book had the potential to be so much more if only the author had taken a few more months in revision. I wondered if perhaps the movie would have picked up where the author failed and in some ways they improved the inconsistencies in the plot but they left out the violence and rage and danger that the initiates faced in training which is the most compelling part of the story. I kept asking myself if this was about the ratings. Did they need it to be G rated to bring in more viewers? Totally flabbergasted by both the book and the movie. Both left me feeling like they had the opportunity to be significant but failed.,1407542400,,862,4.2303030303030305

Maybe it's because I am nitpicky, maybe it's because I am a super book nerd, or maybe it's because this movie was just terrible. This movie was just not likable. I completely understand that almost 99% of the time, there is no comparing the movie to the book, the book is always better (except One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I hated that book with a passion, but that movie is a classic!! go ahead, judge me)! There were just too many differences, too many things left out, and too many changes. The ending, that's all that really needs to be said, it was awful! I hated that simple things were left out or changed completely in the movie. Yes those things were simple and minor, but they were also important to the plot of the book. If you have not read the book and are not a huge fan of the series, you can probably enjoy the movie. If you enjoyed the book and the rest of series, watch the movie with an extremely open mind to change and differences, otherwise you will hate it as much as I did!",1407542400,,1107,4.177570093457944

6103672,5,B00GQQ77IU,"This movie delivers a powerful message about being an individual and not conforming to a category defined by society. It is not a new theme, some other reviewers have suggested The Hunger Games movies as being similar, however, I disagree and feel they deliver a different message, a ""hate the rich"" or ""the rich are evil"" theme, which Divergent stays clear away from. Initially this movie reminded me of Anthem by Any Rand (if you like this movie you'll love Anthem, you can read it in a few hours and it too brilliantly portrays the message of being yourself in society). I very much enjoyed this movie, especially the celebration of individuality. If you are the kind of person that prefers hiding in groups or hates people that stand out as exceptional, don't waste your money on this movie because it will make you angry; be guided accordingly.",1407542400,,849,4.743243243243243

I saw the DVD knowing what to expect , so I was not disappointed when I saw a lousy movie with cheesy acting.  Though I never read the book it is based on...I have seen Hunger Games with Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley (lead actress) is no Jennifer Lawrence.  She looks similar, but the raw talent is just not there to make her believable in this movie.  There are scenes that are great, but then the director says ""cut"" and he goes and chases after another subplot...leaving the concept of the moment loss.  What you end up watching is a ""hodge-podge"" of the Matrix, Hunger Games and a little bit of every futuristic science fiction movie ever made.

6103709,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Not nearly as good a transition from book to screen as the Hunger Games series so far.  Major rewrites of the story in places.  Starts off pretty good but not as well matched at the end.  The lead actress is better than I expected at playing Tris, but we are also dealing with studio the clearly wanted this to be her ""Jennifer Lawrence"" moment so they keep her too clean and her hair to well groomed.  Same problem with NBCs Revolution.. its a bad genre I call  ""Salon Punk"", post apocalyptic but with perfect hair... you may not be aware of the cameras in every scene , but you are aware of the hair stylist off camera.
With all the rewrites at the end of the movie, they still left it just a bit unfulfilling.  If you like the books, I think you will still enjoy the movie, Kate Winslet nails Jeanine Matthews, in general the casting is really good.  I liked the first 2 books, 3# is slow slog to get through.. but I was still was entertained by this movie and will rent it next year when it hits Amazon or Red box.  If you like the movie at all, the books are better fire up the Kindle and read them.",1407542400,,1104,4.150234741784038

6103714,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Not sure where the ""bad acting"" comments are coming from. I thought everyone was wonderful! I cried when Tris cried toward the end- very moving. I also thought the chemistry between the main characters was perfect - not overdone with instant sappy, romantic love like some other, ahem, Twilight, ahem, movies.

Great book, better movie, in my opinion. The book felt slow in places. I feel like for the sake of time, the movie actually ended up streamlining it. Yes, it's similar to the Hunger Games . . .  what's so bad about that? I'd take 10 more variations of that story to keep having the pleasure of experiencing it. That goes for Harry Potter, too.

You also have to suspend reality for awhile. It is sci-fi, after all. That's the point of movies and books sometimes. Don't try dissecting everything - what a waste of you're time. How can you enjoy anything if you come at it with such a cynical eye?",1407456000,,906,4.54601226993865

The movie though I felt was lackluster.  Flat.  The actress playing the lead did okay and I think it was the script that was to blame, but while we see Tris' determination to see things through, we never actually see her strength and bravery in the movie version.  The chemistry was off too between her and Four.  This is one of those if you read the books you will have a barely enjoyable time watching the movie but if you hadn't then you would probably really like it.  Other issues regarding Peter, Edward, and Al.  I think the movie strayed too far.  I won't buy the movie.  This one is a one view wonder.",1407456000,7,771,4.328671328671328

While Divergent is a little disjointed, it was easier to follow along.  There are some little holes in the storyline, not too disturbing for me though am sure others who have read the book will find them bothersome.

I found some of the dialogue did not flow well, like it was all forced and out of place.  I don't know if it was because some scenes were moved around or if the actor's had that hard a time selling it.  I'll pay more attention during my second viewing it might be I was just distracted by the scene(s).

While I gave this film 3 stars, I enjoyed it, was entertained by it and would not turn up my nose to view it again (where as I'd have to be really hard up to watch The Hunger Games ever again).

I felt compelled to write one here because I believe that for those, such as myself ,who have not read the book (LOL I had never even heard of it), the trailer does not do this film justice.

Merely from viewing the trailer I got the impression that it was your typical, hokey, run-of-the mill, simplistic, not credible dystopian flick.

Contrary to my expectations I found the film to excellently and beautifully paint a realistic post-apocalyptic world requiring little,if any, suspension of disbelief.

6103729,2,B00GQQ77IU,"This review is about the DVD quality not the movie. I put the dvd in to play it and it hung up on the coming features section playing over and over again the same movie promo. I had to force it forward by selecting the menu and then telling it to play movie. Also, at scene 8 it hung up on that scene playing it over and over again without moving forward. I again had to go to the menu and force it into the next scene by selecting the scene after where it hung up thus missing a bit of the movie. It was purchased brand new from Amazon and I have contacted Amazon about replacing it. Hopefully I will have not issues they are usually good about this kind of thing.  Do not know if there is a problem with a block of the copies shipped but wanted to alert people to the issue I had. My rating is due to the problem with the DVD. The movie itself is good but not great. Was not the same as the book in fact an important scene from the book was omitted from the movie which I think helped portray the characters psyches very well and explained things better by utilizing that scene the movie omitted. Also Caleb  did not go to his parents side during the rising of the faction Erudite via control of the Dauntless as they showed in the movie. In the book Caleb was a sniveling self centered superior acting jackass and in the movie they portrayed him as more sympathetic and caring which he was not throughout the book or the subsequent 2 books. (Spoiler alert for those who have not read the books- read at your own risk) In fact I never understood why Tris sacrificied herself for her brother at he end of the third book. Which I thought was the worst ending ever and I think I am supported in this belief by many who read the series. It was a horrible ending no matter how you sliced it and much was left unsaid and unexplained as to he issues for the encampment in the enclosure in Chicago were divulged. I know why they set up the encampments but why they continued  after what was happening on the outside or why the outsiders (not the controllers of the camps but the embattled civilians themselves) did not rebel and crush these ridiculous camps I do not understand. I liked the first two books ok but did not like the third one. It seemed a waste of a powerful and influential character to kill of Tris and the return of the people to Chicago after what they found outside seemed cowardly and a waste of what they knew and what they could do to effect possible futures.

While the movie didn't answer these common sense questions, it did give us more of an inside then the book did.
I don't know what all the bad reviews are for. I thought the acting was above average. The movie kept me interested from beginning to end. Also, the love interest wasn't overbearing. The movie also skipped a lot of pointless violence that I did not like in the book (a kid stabbing another kid in the eye with a fork for fun). So I give it 4 stars cause the movie was fun to watch.

6103734,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is in fact divergent.  It has elements of stories that may remind you of some other movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunger-Games/dp/B008602KQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunger Games</a>.  That said it is unique and engaging, and still keeps the action fan in us happy.  If you enjoy Science Fiction movies that are philosophical about a utopian society you will probably be pleased.  I found it exciting, emotional, and intelligent.  It isn't easy to combine those into a theme that doesn't seem either over the top ridiculous or mushy.  It is successful in making us see a society of people divided into five factions.  Although it seems perfect, inevitably someone gets the idea they are better for ruling the rest.  In this case the supposed intelligent lawmakers.  Was this a jab at lawyers?  The peaceful agrarians that have been the decision makers are now in danger of being overthrown by the treacherous cold and calculating leader of the lawmakers.  These lawmakers shouldn't be capable of such treachery and yet the leader somehow has convinced others like the leader of the law keepers it is for the greater good.  Now to add a twist there are those in the society that could fit in anywhere they want because they have the makings of all, but this divergence is considered a threat and so they are ostracized and are killed or forced to flee the protection of the city.  Perhaps a jab at our worldwide societies having difficulty finding rulers that have intelligence, compassion, and strength of character to stand up for everyone.  I had heard mixed things about the movie, but I'm glad I decided to rent it.

That's my two cents worth.",1407456000,,290,4.538461538461538
6103743,5,B00GQQ77IU,"A lot of folks compare Divergent to Hunger games, and they're right! I saw this at the theater on opening week and wanted to go back, but never made it. So I've been waiting anxiously for it to come out on DVD. In the interim I began to wonder if I was going to enjoy it as much on the small screen. I've gotta say, I love it at least as much now as I did then, if not more. The characters are solid creations, the writing is fabulous, and even the sets are easily believable. You can look at this future Chicago and say ""yeah, I could believe that's how things could look in 100 years. Shailene Woodley is fabulous as Tris. You can believe that this young woman is just that good, and has the strength and courage to face the things she does. And Tris' relationship with Four is genuine and strong, without it taking over the plot. Not to mention that Theo James, as Four, is a handsome young man! They learn that they can trust one another early on and that trust deepens throughout the movie. It's very nice to have a relationship that just grows, without the soap opera angst that you so often see in this type of movie.  Kate Winslet, as Jeanine is a very low key, driven villain, quietly frightening as she creates her own version of hell on earth. One actress/role that I fell in love with instantly, was Ashley Judd, as Tris' mother, Natalie. She was very much the earth mother type, but shows her fangs and claws when things got rough. I just wish she had a bigger role in the movie! Finally, as this is the first role I've seen her in, I have got to say that Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet created quite a lovely, talented child in Zoe Kravitz ;) Finally, Jai Courtney, as Eric, is the embodiment of cold, heartless evil!

I could go on and on, but I'll simply finish by saying, see this movie!",1407456000,3,1802,4.2507288629737605

If it is following the books, then I would say they don't make sense. Spoiler Alert: If you take a test to find out what ""faction"" of this futuristic society you fit, then why would you then be able to just choose what ""faction"" you wish to belong to? That makes absolutely no sense. Then we learn our lead character is a ""divergent"" who supposedly doesn't fit into any ""faction"". Again, what does it matter if you just choose? The movie is a sleeper at best. I don't believe it was worth the price of a rental. As usual with crappy movies they took the few ""good"" scenes to create a trailer.

Some action scenes, especially the gun battles, were handled very poorly showing action of about the quality of thirty years ago.  Some of the sets were fake looking.  With a budget even higher than the Hunger Games, the director did not achieve a quality result like he did in the Illusionist.

6103803,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Okay, so first off, before I go on, you must realize i hated the book. Well, actually, more than the book, I hated the heroine of the book - Tris. I so wanted someone to kill her and put her out of my misery.

That said, I was still intrigued to see the movie. I mean, how could they ruin the book when I hated it, right?

I have to say - except for the final fight scene, I thought they did an amazing job. I actually liked Tris. They followed the book relatively closely - which is funny considering how much I hated the book that I liked the movie version.

In the movie, Tris was likable, Four was...well, YUM! But if they hadn't changed the final scene - if they had kept it relatively close to the original - I might have been able to rave about it completely. But changing that final scene is one of the things I absolutely hate about Hollywood. If you are going to stay SO close to the storyline, why throw it all out at the end? (Don't get me started about their bastardizing Breaking Dawn's ending.) They now don't have the harddrive which is a major issue with Tris at the beginning of the second book. (Of which I was only able to get through 1/3 of that book before giving up. Now I have high hopes for the movie.) Not to mention injecting Janine with the meds to have her destroy the program? Ugh! That was Four's job (and I do prefer the name Four to Tobias). We all know that was his job.

All-in-all, though I gave it 4 stars. It kept my attention. It only took me 2 times to watch it all the way through (most movies take 5-6). And, like I said, I actually liked the heroine in it.

Certainly the moral vanity of identifying oneself as morally superior is just as great as identifying oneself as intellectually superior for the purpose of using violence or the threat of violence to substitute your faction's judgment for the individual judgments of everyone else. It is logically and as a matter of history just as destructive of liberty. The Communists Socialists and the National Socialists murdered en mass to create a morally, racially and  ""inevitably"" better society that the polylogisms of racism, ethics (minus the do no harm dictum) and historical inevitability ""showed"" them to be the correct path -- ""we are the people we've been waiting for""  The movie was everything it tried to be though and I admire good craftsmanship. Remember though Stalin, Envir Pasha, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao and other government thugs justified oppression and mass murder with their moral and intellectual superiority as well as a belief in biological or historical inevitability. They were the people they had been waiting for. More people have been murdered in the name of ""progress"" than for any other cause.",1407369600,,1488,5.274261603375527

Positive were unique graphics and well done sets.  Negative were:  The movie is a combination of: ""Enders Game"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Harry Potter"" and a Harlequin Romance novel. The storyline feels used up and 10 minutes into the movie I felt like I had been sitting there for an hour...actually I felt like I was at the DMV waiting to get my license renewed.  I mentioned the previous movies as the: costumes, vignettes and oratory seemed like they were directly lifted from other movies....it is all predictable to the extreme. The main character does not come across as a smart and tough young woman...instead she comes across as a Mall Rat who misses her IPhone while being truant from a PE class.

6103844,5,B00GQQ77IU,"This is the first of a dystopian trilogy; similar in concept to ""Hunger Games"" in that the protagonists are youthful warriors. I haven't read the popular novels by Veronica Roth, so I don't know how faithful this portrayal is; but I do know I liked it. While it doesn't measure up to the depth of character development in ""Hunger Games"" or to the complex and intelligent story line, it is still an excellent sci/fi actioner, with superb performances by the two main protagonists; a fine support cast; and a good performance behind the camera by Neil Burger. The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic version of Chicago...how appropriate...where society is organized into five distinct factions based on personality types, each understanding and playing its role in order to maintain sociopolitical balance. These are Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite, the names are rather self-explanatory. Youths are tested at the age of 16 and based on results, they pick one in which they choose to belong...for the rest of their lives. There is one other personality type, which you no doubt have guessed is ""Divergent"", which means the youth can fit into more than one faction. They must keep this secret, however, during their training period, or risk being destroyed. The two protagonists are Divergent, one a veteran leader in the Dauntless faction, Four, played by Theo James; and a new Dauntless initiate, Tris, played by Shailene Woodley. During her training period, Tris uncovers a sinister plot by one of the factions that will play havoc with their perfect society...watch the film to see how she handles this discovery. In addition to Woodley and James, look for Kate Winslet in the off-type role of a villain; and Ashley Judd as Tris' mother. If you like the ""Hunger Games"" concept, you should like this one...looking forward to the sequel.",1407283200,3,1867,5.064935064935065

Little Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of the deviants. She survives puberty with help of her mentor Four (Theo James). But will she still survive in a society that is making tad of an adjustment in leadership; will she gum up the works?

I was not familiar with the books that this movie is based and actually didn't know the movie was based on a series of books until after I watched the movie.  Although the movie follows a formulaic plot that reminded me a lot of Hunger Games, I was actually very surprised and enjoyed the story and the movie much more than I expected.

The movie does start out a bit slow as it does take its time to tell the background and set up the main story which are like most movies that are set up to be a trilogy but if you hang on past the backstory that the movie must tell to get you involved, it ends up being worth watching.
Divergent tackles themes similar to Hunger games like should I conform or be an independent thinker, bravery and cowardice and the issues and angst of growing up with a less than perfect family or family expectations that are not your own.

Woodley, James, Judd and Winslet all play their roles well and Woodley and James have good onscreen chemistry with your typical onscreen romance midway through.  The movie does a good job with the action part of the movie without getting overly bloody or graphic, rare these days in an action sci-fi movie.

A surprise to me that made me look forward to not only the sequels due out in the next couple years but interested me in the books because if they are half as good as the movie they will be worth a read.",1407196800,3,1570,4.305084745762712

However, I was puzzled by the basic premise.

Why would anyone think that separating people by occupation, interests, castes or class, in an already dystopian future  would work any better  than it does now, or has in the past?

Additionally, my interests now are quite different than they were as a teenager, or even a 40 year old.  The idea of basing one's entire life on a test administered and a choice made in the tumultous teen years seems rather ridiculous and doomed to failure.",1407196800,2,603,4.486238532110092

6103883,2,B00GQQ77IU,"With the flood of teen lit-inspired movies on the scene today, it can be all-too easy to unfairly shuffle them all under the same leaky roof. Often, that short-sells the more gleaming examples of the genre. Not so with Divergent, a ruthlessly narrow little bit of phony escapism that confirms every ugly stereotype. Dim and wooden, it's a thoroughly hand-holding bit of tack that can't seem to get over how breathlessly important it thinks it is. The generic core storyline has nothing to offer, over-familiar and rich with the scent of manufactured drama. Its cast, thin and transparent as they come, spends most of the bloated runtime reveling in their own majesty at the expense of actual character development. Not that the actors seem capable of exploring any such depth, were they given the material to work with. Shailene Woodley and Theo James, beautiful people without so much as a single spark between them, seem to have been chosen exclusively for their pouty appearances on the promotional materials. Likewise, an awkwardly mismatched sparkle-pop soundtrack stands at odds with the bleak, dystopian tones that the plot stretches for. At least the visual effects are well done, for what that's worth. It's a real waste of time and effort, an insulting vehicle to cash-in on the latest craze and promote a few of the parent company's tunes while they're at it.

6103925,2,B00GQQ77IU,"This movie was so slow it was ridiculous, which is fitting because the premise is equally bad.  If believing the premise Hunger Games movie was a stretch of the imagination, this movie will require a lobotomy to be believable.  Basically, for unknown reasons the world has ended, and presumably the last civilization on earth is contained to New York city, which I would assume would be the first place to go in the event of the end of the world.

.A small group of survivors has broken themselves down into middle-ages style Indian Class system.  The main ones to be concerned about are the Abnegation, who govern things, the Erudite whom are their scientists and the Dauntless who are basically their military but act more like a gang straight out the Warriors.  We also have the classless which are people that belong to no group.  The Divergent on the other hand is someone who doesn't really belong to a class but can work in all classes.  Divergents are feared because they break down social order, but its a very irrational fear that makes absolutely no sense what so ever.  It seems pretty simple to just take a divergent and let them choose a class, but nope, the Erudites feel they have to be killed, for reasons that are never adequately explained.  Our two main characters are Tress, a divergent who leaves Abnegation for Dauntless, and Four, a trainer at Dauntless.

So the plot of the movie is basically the Erudites have decided to take over the city by mind controlling the Dauntless.  Simple quest for power should have been enough of a motivation for the reader/watcher, but instead the writers try to convince us that the Erudites just have misplaced good intentions because they believe the Abnegation are breaking down the social order.  Irony is of course lost on the Erudites because breaking down social order is exactly what they are doing.  For a group of people that are supposed to be the smart ones, they have a pretty stupid concept of social order.

I am getting ahead of myself here because none of the above actualy happens until the last 35 minutes of this 3 hour movie.  Our main Character is Tris, who is divergent but training among the Dauntless.  This is literally 2 1/2 hours of the movie.  Its not until the last 30 minutes or so do we learn the Erudites are trying to take over, and only after they mind control everyone.  Of course, this is when the flaws in the movie start.

1.  Divergents for reasons unknown are immune to the mind control.  No idea why, other than the watcher/reader is expected to accept this as fact.

2.  These people have some extremely advanced technology for a civilization limited to a few city blocks.  Where are they getting this technology with little to no resources?

3.  Somehow by taking a shot in the neck, and taping a wire to your temple, you can see a persons dreams.  Very specific dreams btw that are tailored to the individual class and fears.  No idea how this is done.  This of course can be accepted as fact within the confines of the story, but somehow by shooting someone else nearby with the same chemical allows them to enter the others head.  Okay, there is no wires linking them.  They aren't connected in anyway, but are somehow able to interact with each other.

4.  The brain control drug is an injection that makes people highly susceptible to suggestion.  The problem is that no one is given any suggestions.  A machine somehow remotely issues commands, but there is no link up, or means of transmission.  Furthermore, the interface is extremely complicated and makes no sense, but apparently it can be shut down with a few buttons that aren't labeled.  I thought the Erudites are supposed to be smart, but apparently they missed the lesson on User Interfaces when programming their machine. Later when the bad guy is injected with the serum, she is simply commanded to turn off the machine, but up until now, it was assumed it required the machine to issue the commands.  If voice suggestions works, wouldn't it be simple to just tell the Dauntless, ""Don't shoot me.""  It is also shown that the serum doesn't work if the subject is forced to go against their nature, which allowed the character Four to break its control.  It would be reasonable to assume that many of the Dauntless would have broken the control when ordered to murder children and other innocents.

5.  Tris and Four pretend to be mind control and when their cover is broken, they are given the opportunity to kill the bad guy leaders, but instead shoot one of them in the leg and run.  Of course they don't kill them, because that would end the movie prematurely.

6.  Too much tragedy.  For the final 30 minutes of the film, Tris's mother is killed, she then kills one of her friends, and then her father is killed.  The mother's death was traumatic enough, but after killing her friend and dad dying, I really stopped caring.  This made me feel like the director knew he spent too much time on Tres's training (2 hours), which in no way furthered the plot, and not was now rushing through the book that the movie is based on.

7.  After shutting down the brain machine, they are given yet another chance to kill the main bad guy, to which they don't.  This of course is forgivable, because there is nothing else to win, but they are forced to quickly flee before the rest of the co-conspirators arrive.  Rushing outside, they are quickly joined by the no longer mind controlled Dauntless at which point you'd think they'd work to restore order to the city.  Wrong.  Instead they jump on the first train out of town to the unknown beyond the city walls, abandoning the city completely.  They even take the  Abnegation leader who turns out to be Fours dad.  You'd think the guy would have some work to do being governor of the city, and Four would be needed to rally the Dauntless to restore order and arrest the conspirators, but nope, they just simply leave.

8.  It is explained that the classless are people that don't fit in to society, but it is later explained they are also made up of people that washed out of their chosen class, which seems to be an extremely high bar for the Dauntless who immediately cut anyone in the bottom 20%.  This seems to be a tremendous waste of resources as surely these people could be made to contribute elsewhere, like Sanitation or rebuilding the city, a function that doesn't seem to be a responsibility of any of the classes. For whatever reason, they aren't allowed to move to another class.  This makes even less sense when you consider that many of them grew up in classes not of their chosen.  Instead the classless are left to be a dependent, handed food, clothing and shelter by the other classes instead of being allowed to contribute to the society.

9.  There doesn't seem to be any old people.  Most everyone seems to be under the age of 35.  There is a select few people in the movie that appear to be in their mid-40s, but most everyone appears to be between the age of 20 and 30.  The Dauntless particularly have no old people.

In truth, this movie is only 30 minutes of plot, with 2 1/2 hours of scene setting.  An immensely implausible scene.  While the Hunger Games required the suspension of belief that a society would allow such an event, the society depicted in Divergent is completely non-functional and moronic.",1407024000,2,7347,4.602771362586605

Visually, there are some fun special effects and stunts, and the CGI post-apocalyptic Chicago is much more interesting than other landscapes weve seen. The whole point of ""Hunger Games"" was survival, but survival here is a by-product. The real issues are questions of identity and societal structure: family vs. society, knowing the self, having to make a decision that basically pigeonholes you for the rest of your life at a time when you DONT know yourself, and, of course, the theme of divergence""of having the inclination or desire to have more than one virtue or impulse.

While the love story fell short compared to twilight, it more than made up for it with a unique and thought provoking story.

I just recently completed listening to all three books in the series on Audible.com

Movies are typically cut down from the book versions, but many stand well despite this.  The Green Mile is an excellent example of an adaptation that stayed fairly faithful to the book version with a few alterations that were not significantly missed (though one was).  But character relationships that translate to plot points that aren't translated to the movie might cause alterations of the plot that many will be disappointed by.

One example in this movie is the budding relationship between Christine and Will.  Gone in the movie, this will have an impact on Tris's killing Will.  Either the death will not cause Christine to hold a major grudge against Tris, or there will be that emotional conflict without a movie understanding of why.

The characters as individuals just don't have the same strong impact  in the movie that they do in the books.

6103976,5,B00GQQ77IU,Outstanding movie translation of the Amazing Divergent novel by Veronica Roth. As a lover of the entire Divergent series I was at first nervous to hear this novel was being made into a movie. As one who has been disappointed countless times by movies based on novels I've loved I was on cloud nine after watching this movie and so very pleased on how well the movie was done and how true it was to the novel. Not a single disappointment here and I deem this a MUST WATCH movie. Loved it so much I even bought the movie and was surprised at how interesting I found the behind the scenes bones features were. Just thre last short comments after I got off cloud nine from watching this movie: 1. HOT DANG! Four (Theo James) is a sexy piece of man candy. 2. Where can I get a pair of Tris' pants??? and 3. I hand no idea how young and beautiful Veronica Roth was!,1406764800,,859,4.212121212121212
6103977,5,B00GQQ77IU,"GREAT Movie! Nothing else to say. It was based off the books by Veronica Roth and to say she was in any way lacking imagination would be a sin. Great basis of reality (for the time in the movie). The way it followed the book with slight changes (as Hollywood always does) was great. For, or Tobias as it is and Tris are awesome characters.

And now that I've read the entire series I am able to compare it. I definitely noticed the film deviations from the book but it all worked well so I didn't mind them. I do hope that Four's character remains as strong as it does in this movie because the Four portrayed in the rest of the series disappointed me. Can't wait for the next one...

6104055,3,B00GQQ77IU,"The trailers showed a rather ham-fisted ""they don't like us 'cos we're different"" story in the works. I wasn't too keen on another two-hour sermon written by teenagers.

But it was compelling, and it didn't feel overlong.

It's another take on Brave New World, but where you're given a choice where to belong. You may have to forsake your family if you switch clans (a creepy and nasty requirement).

Government is given to the Abnegation faction, which seems like a good idea. However, the ""intellectual"" crowd, led by Kate Winslet thinks that the smart people should obviously rule instead, and want to take over.

We generally enjoyed the movie. Even with its somewhat predictable turns, there were some interesting ideas (although the flag capture bit was oddly simpleminded).

But I had a problem empathizing with Tris. Shailene Woodley may have been good in other roles, but here there's something repellent about her. She seems cold, calculating, privileged, the Wonder Girl everyone is supposed to gape at. It's not that that here - she does get pummeled and such - but that's the vibe she gives off. I just didn't like her for most of the movie.

Viewers may be confused by the movie's message. On the one hand it's another tiresome sermon on being different. On the other hand, it's about the dangers of the self-styled ""intellectuals"" wanting to be in charge - which may be seen as a criticism of the current administration, and of socialist fascism in general, where government controls everything. When you see Kate Winslet's character, you immediately think ""Hillary"", which I did not expect for such a movie. It will certainly offend her supporters, if they realize this.",1406505600,,1686,4.939929328621908

6104068,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Had it been made with some more originality - or ten or more years earlier perhaps - ""Divergent"" would have received more positive reviews. Everything in this sci-fi fantasy action (based on Veronica Roth books) is so familiar, especially for those who have seen ""The Hunger Games"" and other young adult themed films, that you can almost predict what is happening next.

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where the entire population is divided into five factions based on their dispositions. Shailene Woodley (""The Descendants"") is Beatrice Prior, 16-year-old daughter of an ""Abnegation"" family, who decides to be ""Dauntless"" at the Choosing Ceremony.

We don't know why she should choose that group whose sole interest seems to be doing parkour. That doesn't matter; the point is, renamed as ""Tris,"" she struggles to survive the tests, and finds herself slowly attracted to the mysterious instructor Four (Theo James).

Directed by Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"" ""Limitless""), ""Divergent"" is 140 minutes of very average fun. The lead players are both very good, but the concept of ""Divergent,"" those who can think independently, is not fully explored. I hope the studio will come up with new ideas that are more interesting for the planned sequels.",1406419200,34,1268,5.236453201970443

As for the movie:  Awesome adaptation.  The casting was perfect, with the only exception being Christina.  I imagined somebody taller for her character.  It was obvious the producers had to leave out quite a bit due to time constraint.  Maybe it would have been better if it had been a two-part movie.  It was good though and I'm glad I saw it (and rewatched it) so don't feel like I wasted four hours of my life.

6104077,3,B00GQQ77IU,I expected more. Better soundtrack. More charismatic cast .. Tris in particular. There seems to be no connection between Tris and Four. They act as they are drown to each other but it seems very stiff.,1406419200,,201,4.611111111111111
6104078,1,B00GQQ77IU,"Based on what I heard from friends/family, I had great expectations for this movie.  The story line had the potential to be great, but was ruined by the horrible and atrocious acting, the lackluster fight scenes that looked completely staged vs. realistic and the main actress was just bad, bad, bad!  Actually, all the acting was bad.  They needed someone like Scarlett Johansson to pull this movie off.  Whoever directed this film lacked the vision to make this a great film.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and am upset we paid $19.99 to own it, but there wasn't an option to just rent it.  Ugh!",1406419200,7,609,4.644859813084112

6104080,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Truly 3.5 stars. I did not read the book. This movie reminded me of The Hunger Games since its youth face huge challenges early in life that have lethal consequences.

The people of the world in the future have specific roles that are classified into five types - Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (Intelligent), Dauntless (Brave), Amity (The Peaceful), and Candor (The Honest).  Children participate in the faction to which they are born but when they reach age 16, after taking an aptitude test, they choose the faction that they will serve for the remainder of their lives, during an annual ceremony. Decisions are irreversible and if the teens choose a faction different from the one they were born into, they must leave their families to reside with their new faction.

The female protagonist is Beatrice/Tris (Shailene Woodley).  She was born to the Abnegation faction (not allowed to view themselves in a mirror for very long to discourage vanity and dresses in modest dresses of muted grey) with female long hair kept to a certain length and drawn back into a bun). This faction serves others particularly the homeless and hungry masses who have no faction (factionless). Beatrice and her brother choose a faction and realize that all is not what it seems behind the scenes in the factions and in the world.  There is a love match for Beatrice with a man in her faction that presents great challenges for both of them.

The book/movie's name is derived from a group of people whose aptitude test results are inconclusive. These people are known as Divergent. They can control their fear and so realize that their testing scenario (hallucination) is not real and alter the manner in which they resolve perilous challenges within the testing matrix. Divergents are usually killed since their brains are different and allow them to take risks (in real life) and they are therefore considered to be dangerous. They are impervious to mind control.

I did not engage with the female protagonist's character since she seemed to be one-dimensional. I did not feel as though I knew her at all so the movie failed to portray her character with enough depth and I, therefore, could not empathize adequately with her. The romance between Beatrice and her man lacked heat so the bond between them seemed contrived and strained. Perhaps the reason for this was that the target audience was too young for much else (movie rating).  Perhaps viewers who had read the book were more invested.  I would not watch this movie again.",1406419200,,2516,4.9011764705882355

6104092,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Having read the first two books twice and then the last book recently, I was really excited (and not too surprised) to see that they made it into a movie.

Shailene Woodley was new to me and I wasn't too sure about her at first, but she very quickly became a perfect Tris to me. Her scene with her dying mother was very moving.  Theo James had just the right amount of toughness and tenderness.  Great choices.  The set was fantastic - really transported me right into the setting of the story.  Very believable.

Parents beware!  Your kids are gonna want to start jumping onto and off of trains and gettig tattoos! Good luck with that!  I DID love how the sense of vitality was created for Dauntless though - kudos to the director.

I'd get the cr## beat out of me in Dauntless, but I'd love the zipline!",1406332800,,805,4.348993288590604

I felt that they did not spend enough time on character development. We went through the movie barely knowing anything about any of the characters.  I did not feel invested in their struggle at all.

And the main female lead was so under-whelming that I was wondering when she was going to STOP getting her butt kicked every time they showed her ""training"".

Basically the show jumps from one concept to the next, without fully developing the first.  For example, at the end of the movie I was still wondering what the hell was special about a Divergent, since even the ""peaceful"" guys that were supposed to be unable to change or have free will picked up guns and fought at the end.

Each faction represents a different aspect of society: academics, the military, charity, etc.  A ""divergent"" is someone who doesn't fit into a particular category based on an arbitrary test.  Other than said test there really is absolutely no explanation as to why we (or the world's characters) should be interested in divergents.  It isn't clear how this society is so oppressive.  Oh no... you have to have a job when you grow up?  This is like a story about the tyranny of a personality test.  It is silly.  The story itself is a long plodding training movie, with the main character joining a military faction.  The action isn't good.  There is a cheesy romance stuffed in that doesn't serve the story in any way.  This is just a bad, bad movie.",1406073600,12,875,4.640522875816994

The story was changed to remove the parts I did not like.  And best of all for those of us who hated the final book, the movie has changed that book in every way.

This movie was fast paced.  It was exciting, and it ended in a satisfying way.  This is what the books should have been, but they were not.

6104183,4,B00GQQ77IU,"The background
Classically, after a huge event like a global war, a new order has risen.
Now, in fence protected Chicago five factions exist, based on their virtues.
Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave,
and Erudite the intelligent. And of course there are those that do not fit any of those,
the faction less, the place that everyone dreads to be.

The plot
At the age 16, all young people go through a selection process that is based on a serum,
in order to see in which faction they should belong too (kind like the Shorting Hat in Hogwarts).
Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley, ""The Descendants"") goes in to have the test, but there
in no definite conclusions, and she shows traits from various factions. She is a divergent!
She eventually chooses the Dauntless and goes into training where eventually she does great,
because we already know that there is something special about her. And this will only
bring about problems, since divergents are hunted down by the rulers.
Add to that that the Erudite want to overthrow the Abnegation from ruling,
and we finally have some real plots in the movie other than training.

The story is based on the books by Veronica Roth, and of course it is a trilogy, a Hollywood
fashion in these past year.
Of course it is a rival series to the Hunger Games, and , but I am not sure that Woodley would
like to have the same fate as Jennifer Lawrence.
Still, it is a good futuristic sci fi movie, despite the girly feelings and stuff
It is an action movie and that is what you should expect, although the 2 hours plus duration is a little too much.

In IMDB they gave a 7.4 rating and in Rotten Tomatoes a 5.4, if you are interested in such things",1406073600,2,1729,4.535256410256411
6104184,2,B00GQQ77IU,"I don't see how anyone who loves the books can enjoy this movie. I saw it in theaters and almost left as the number of inconsistencies increased and, in my opinion, key points were changed or left out completely. I stayed hoping it'd get better... I should have asked for a refund. I have seen tons of movies (probably averaging one a week for the past 10 years) including book-to-film adaptations, and I am not so impractical as to think that it would be possible to match the book exactly. But I was so surprisingly, incredibly impressed with the book that the movie version crashed and burned infinitely harder than anything the Dauntless could dream of. The Dauntless themselves were mild versions of the book descriptions. Hard for 90% of the people, even just those in the background, to look pretty with the extreme hair, tattoos and piercings depicted in the book. But that's typical Hollywood, especially for a film with teen romance. But in my opinion that doesn't excuse Eric missing half his piercings which the book repeatedly gave detailed descriptions of. And speaking of tattoos, of course they had to change Four's... The ending was the worst - COMPLETELY different from the book, and I can't fathom why. To me, the specifics there were very significant to the story as a whole; it seemed very important the way it happened in the book. The changes to some of the fear landscapes were almost as bad. But I won't go into detail and give spoilers. My curiosity got the better of me, but I wish I had skipped the movie and not tainted the amazing universe and story that Roth created purely with words.

My conclusion is you might like it for two reasons: 1. If you haven't read the book, you might like it if you can catch the wisps of what the book contained (the psychology). But if you think it's good, you're better off treating yourself to the book. 2. If you're looking for a dystopian teen love story, probably while suffering Twilight withdrawals, this might hold you over for a bit. (And if you saw ""Fault in Our Stars"" and think Shailene Woodle can carry this movie, don't hold your breath.)

2/5 stars because 1 star is reserved for only those purely bad movies, and as I said this has wisps of what makes the book so great. And because by definition, an adaptation is not an exact replica. It should have tried harder to be, though.",1405987200,8,2359,4.587677725118484

Its just one writer aping another series which ripped off its main concept from s Japanese movie=)  Female heroine, check.  Good looking brooding love interest. Check.

Woodley was good.  That's about it. She certainly gave Triss a lot more meat then I ever got out of the book.

6104195,3,B00GQQ77IU,"And here we go, another YA novel adapted into a film. They never seem to slow down. After the major successes of 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight', they did a test run with 'The Hunger Games'. And after that film became a huge success, other studios decided to test their strengths at making young adult novels into films, creating the likes of several disasters including that of 'The Host', and 'The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones' as well as several mediocre yet not completely tasteless films such as 'Beautiful Creatures' and 'Enders Game'. They never seem to slow down. Even when those four films flopped completely, studios still went on thinking they could make that next 'Hunger Games' or 'Twilight'. And after another flop this year with 'Vampire Academy' they finally did. And that success is 'Divergent'. A film that is very much similar to the other adaption's yet somewhat better. Not that better in narrative but in a few other traits. My review of 'Divergent'.

In 'Divergent', a post-apocalypse setting, Beatrice Prior (Played By 'Spectacular Now' star Shailene Woodley) must decide what she wants to do with her life. At a certain age, she and others her age, must choose one of five fractions (sorta like the 'districts' in The Hunger Games) based on their personality traits, to live in the rest of their lives. Learning she is Divergent (Divergence, is in which the person doesn't fit into one faction) Beatrice decides on Dauntless, people who guard the city, and protect the fractions. Leaving her family behind, Beatrice, now called Tris, must survive the initiation process, and try to mask her divergence, or risk being killed at the hands of the cruel Erudite leader Jeanine (Played by Kate Winslet).

A simple plot formula which is used in almost every other YA film adaption. Director 'Neil Burger' doesn't try to expand the interesting world, and try to make something different of the idea. As my father said 'It plays out like Hunger Games'. It does, nothing about it comes out as unique of any kind. You would think with almost 2 and a half hours, you would be able to do a little with the idea, but no, instead we are bombarded with plenty of tests. Which is ok, they were fun enough to watch and showed Tris slowly evolve from a weak and hopeless girl, to a strong and radiant woman.

The plain and predictable plot isn't so hard to sit through when you get the likes of a formidable cast, who dauntlessly (As the characters would say) fought the formula with their talents. 'Shailene Woodley' plays the lead with ease. She is easily believable, and is good eye candy for the audience. Her strengths and weaknesses are portrayed realistically on screen, and she projects a glow whenever she's on screen. Surprisingly, her co-lead 'Theo James' does a better than expected performance as Tris's mentor and future lover. He isn't as useless as you'd expect a male co-star in a YA adaption to be. He plays out more than your average heartthrob. Being there to do more than make out with the lead, and say romantic wooden dialogue. He holds his own and has great chemistry with Woodley. Other than them, the rest of the cast doesn't have much time to shine. 'Miles Teller' does fine, and 'Kate Winslet' plays a civilized villain in a more miner role.

It's too bad that the actors didn't have much stronger characters. Other than Tris and Four, the other characters are lifeless. They are just there. Tris's trio of friends include the suicidal Al, the smarty Will, and the tough as nails Christina. They are all the shallowest characters I have ever seen. None of the three get more than 10 minutes of screen time each. Barely, and that's not even of them speaking, mostly of them just standing there watching events or whatever they do. It's too bad, they had time to improve and become more solid then they had become. I mean, again with an almost 2 and a half hour film, why not spend a little bit more on character development and a little less on constant action. I mean it was fun, but I'd liked more than to characters to leave an impact on me. Peter, the bully, is known at the end as a bully, for no reason whatsoever. I know he's not the main character but why not give him a more clear reason to be such a jackass jerk. And Al, one of Tris's friends, why'd he turn on her? Just because he could? He had to have a reason to do so, so why not explain it. Take a dang moment and explain why. Why?! Gosh darn it; don't slack off on your characters just to satisfy your action hungry hearts.

With a modest 80 million budget, you would expect the film to make good use of it, visually. And they do, the visuals look crisp and clean. And with most of the budget going towards marketing, the film had even less money to use on visuals and I believe they succeeded in making better than average effects. Let's take the City of Chicago for instantance. It looks dystopian and futuristic. The buildings and houses look dystopian, ok, I'll admit some of that want toward good sets but most of the touch ups used to really make the city look the dystopian setting was due to visual effects. Some of the visual effects look abit rough then others but in the end it works fine.

A particularly interesting scene was involving a zip line. I felt the angles and shooting worked perfectly well for the scene. The camera work, was just fine, shooting different angles, that show all the necessary details and action, and that is good.

What bothers me was the rough editing. The film is quick paced, which makes for a pretty fun joy ride, but the editing kind of upsets the fun. Cutting crude, and quickly from one shot to the next, and it kind of hearts your eyes. It's not even small edit mistakes, it's pretty big ones. You're at one area and then at another, and back to the same area, and it just doesn't flow with the pacing. It's alittle too much. The pacing makes the film out to be a fast roller coaster, but with the editing, it became a bumpy roller coaster. And not for the best.

The script includes some moments of pure intellect, but is quickly turned off by some pretty bland instances of wooden dialogue. I mean, the dialogue was in no means cringe worthy, but somewhat tasteless and seemed filled with too many of the same words and phrases. Nothing that makes you think hard, all just one liners.

The costumes are pretty to the point, and in the simplest form, but what makes them stand out, are the slight changes that you see to differentiate each fraction from each other. The costumes define each fraction. Let's take for instance, the Abnegation fraction and the Dauntless Fraction. The Abnegation fraction members wear heavy layers of simple grey clothing. And the Dauntless members wear tight, showy, black clothing. When looked up, the color black means protection. Which in fact defines the jobs of the Dauntless. They are the guards, the protectors of the city.

All and All, 'Divergent' doesn't add anything to the YA adaption genre (yes, it now qualifies as a genre) in plot points, which weakens the film as a whole, but the sold cast and visuals make up for that, not by much but they fix the predictable formula and the shallow characters at least enough to make this film sit - through able. C 3/24/14

P.S: Let's see if the other YA adaption's to be released this year can succeed in accomplishing what 'Divergent' did, or even better, be better then 'Divergent' was. That would include 'The Maze Runner' and 'The Giver' both scheduled for late summer and early fall releases. Until then, we can only hope they do more to the characters then simple have them there, and add a twist or two that don't follow the genre's own playbook.",1404691200,2,7692,4.603209336250912

They would not like the idea of 'thinking' people who do not belong to a certain faction only till the rest of their lives, i.e. divergent ones.

6104202,2,B00GQQ77IU,"In many ways, ""Divergent"" has the familiar trappings of a romantic fantasy picture - the shy, feckless girl swoons over the handsome, distant alpha male and both fall head over heels for each other. But the mold is broken by the plot, which has the girl go through a series of basic training tasks to join a futuristic marine corps. The tasks include fighting her recruits, jumping onto rooftops from moving trains and taking a hallucinogenic drug that simulates dangerous situations. I can't imagine why any of this would appeal to a teenage girl. Do young women really fantasize about going through basic training? It's like someone crossed the plot of ""GI Jane"" with a romance novel. The best way to characterize ""Divergent"" is a feminist spin on teen romance pictures. The girl gets the handsome guy, but she also has to prove herself in a masculine way. To succeed in Dauntless (the name of the marine corps-like clan the main character joins), she has to display masculine qualities like strength, bravery, and marksmanship.

The movie propagates the feminist lie that men and women are the same except for their reproductive organs. In just about every scene, you see as many women in Dauntless as men. But when you see what the recruits have to go through to join Dauntless, you realize that few, if any, women would make the cut. There are physical and psychological differences between the sexes that would skew the difference lopsidedly in favor of men. In one scene, the film breaks from feminist non-reality when the girl is beaten senseless by a muscular young man in a test of hand-to-hand combat. All of this happens while the drill sergeants watch on. Why would they encourage her to fight a man, as if she stood a chance against him? Either the drill sergeants are sadists, or they're woefully ignorant of human physiology.

I don't know who this film is made for. It's like a cross between a teen romance picture, Full Metal Jacket and Logan's Run. Apparently this is what appeals to teenage girls now.",1400976000,8,2021,4.787965616045845

6104204,2,B00GQQ77IU,"There is no shortage of young adult novels that encourage the individual and warn against conformity; Divergent is one such novel. However, the film based on the massively popular Veronica Roth novel ignores those lessons and aims to have absolutely no originality or individuality from its acting right down to its execution.

The film opens a la Twilight with a brief and information-rich voice-over that gives us the low-down on a dystopian and futuristic Chicago. Society has been segmented into five personality-based factions: Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, Candor, and Abnegation from which our heroine Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) hails. At the age of 16, Beatrice, later known as Tris, must take an aptitude test, which all young people must take in order to discover which faction they would be most apt to join. The test results in a recommendation, but it is ultimately the decision of each individual to select the faction they want to join. The catch is that once a person selects a faction, there is no going back and a rigid training session begins that if not passed results in that persons dismissal and the shameful label of being factionless.

After Triss aptitude test comes back inconclusive, she resolves to join the Dauntless faction, dedicated to fearlessness and bravery. If this process sounds similar to another YA novels categorization element, thats because it is absurdly similar to the sorting ceremony in J.K Rowlings Harry Potter series. Harry Potters uniqueness is a cause for one particular recommendation by the sorting hat in The Sorcerers Stone, yet he disregards it to declare his allegiance to another house. Triss inconclusive test is actually code for her being a unique anomaly within society called a Divergent. Simply put, this means that her aptitude is not wholly within one faction but a combination of them all.

The films opening act is relatively interesting and does a passable job of explaining the world these characters inhabit. The problem is that there is not enough newness to this story and while the film is just another adaptation of another beloved young adult novel, that doesnt mean it shouldnt be held to the same originality standards as any other genre. Furthermore, once the Tris enters the world of the Dauntless, a whole new bag of issues emerges that sink the film even farther.

Most of the film from this point forward is an excruciatingly long and played out training set-up piece for a lackluster climactic finish. Triss struggles at Dauntless are pitted against her secret identify as a Divergent. Will she be discovered? Are there other Divergents? Will she hook up with the hunky I don't want to be just one thing, Four (Theo James)? These questions will be answered, just don't hold your breath. The film gets so caught up in its own mythology, that it never really even considers convincing the audience why these Divergents are so dangerous. Divergents are people who can think for themselves and have multiple skills and talents. It becomes increasingly clear why Erudite faction leader Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) is not fond of Divergents, but why does the rest of society view them as dangerous? A few tacked on lines of dialogue towards the end attempt to answer this, but not to any satisfaction.

A few words about Shailene Woodley. She has emerged on the scene with great success in films like The Descendants and The Spectacular Now. In Divergent, Woodleys performance is quite bland and well, wooden. She broods, she emotes with deep and hyperventalative breathing, she conveys confusion at the right times, but she never quite achieves a connection with the audience worth rooting for. Director Neil Burger is at least partly responsible for this flavorless and wishy-washy performance. His direction involves running back to the well of successful YA novel adaptations and hand picking the qualities he thought worked in other places.

6104206,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Given that this was geared specifically toward the YA market - I'd say this was not bad.

A great war has left Chicago as the only known civilized city left on the planet. Walled off from unseen enemies, society has rebuilt itself along five castes - or 'factions' as writer Veronica Roth defines them.

Each faction representing the distilled prime qualities of humanity - Kindness, Logic, Honesty, Bravery, and Peacemaker. As each young person reaches their late teens, a neural psych test is given - revealing the inner essence of their strongest quality. Life after that point is a choice of Faction. Choose one and you're forever bonded to them - one can never go back and one can never choose again.

The story opens with Beatrice, daughter to a pair of followers of Abnegation, representing the generosity found within humanity. Their lives are devoid of ego. Their purpose in life to serve those who fell through the cracks - people who are without a faction; essentially caring for the homeless, family-less, and downtrodden. Interestingly, they have also been chosen as the leaders of the city. It's their gentle touch that insures society never again repeats the mistakes of the past. Think Amish.

Beatrice and her brother are about to embark on their life journey as their Selection Day is finally at hand.

Their parents, who have devoted their lives to humility and charity, believe they have instilled in their children the right qualities to also choose Abnegation. It comes as an ice cold bath to watch each child select something completely different. Their son opts for the cold logical world of science - Erudite. And Beatrice? Out of nowhere she chooses to become a warrior and selects Dauntless.

Each child abandoning their parent's core beliefs and even their parents themselves.

But unbeknownst to the greater population - a secret and deadly struggle is underway. One that will make everyone's choice moot if the dark powers behind the movement succeed in their twisted plan.

Was the plot routine? Yeah. The acting? Sufficient with moments of excellence. The filmmakers put together a tight enough weave that kept the various threads from spiraling out of focus.

My experience with the resurgent 'HG' franchise has shown that some executive producers can indeed right an unsteady ship by having adjusted the problems of a mediocre first film.

Am a fan of young Shailene Woodley - have been since the incredible film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descendants/dp/B007JRU2UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descendants</a>'. But I'm not entirely sold on her portrayal as Tris. Again, it wasn't bad. But there was a noticeable lack of depth to her character. I attribute that to the uninspired plot, a script which really doesn't offer strong word play, and in my opinion, a surprising lack of firmer direction from Neil Burger.

Still, I'm hopeful.

For this initial effort - a very solid 3 stars.

Personal Note:

- The basic concept that author Veronica Roth writes about - of choosing a life away from one's family, completely cutting them off in favor of some idealized social group, is actually pretty creepy. Very much the means by which cults and gangs recruit and control their ""believers"".

Again - creepy.",1400284800,17,3287,5.152255639097745

Basically, 'You are innately good at this, you belong in this particular group' and this other group of people based on their personalities and abilities are in another. Later what follows is that egos of human nature sometimes get inflated and want to act out. ""My utopic vision is better than yours."". What I have grown tired of is these many types of stories, at least played out on screen is the 'fight, kill, domination...' idea of obtaining a better society.
What I feel would make a more refreshing story line in this particular film is to see the various factions actually succeeding on various levels and then later at the end to illustrate that utopia will always be elusive and ultimately an illusion, time permitting.",1399852800,,1063,4.846153846153846

I remember coming across the book while searching for something to read a few times, but couldn't remember why I'd decided against it. So after seeing the trailers, I decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad I did. I thought everyone involved in the project did great.

After seeing the movie, I decided to read the book - compare and contrast the two mediums. Honestly, I think the movie is much better. The screenwriter took the book story's potential and fleshed it out on the screen. The dialogue was tighter and better written in the movie, and Tris didn't come across as judgmental and rather selfish as she did in the book. She seemed to form a real friendship with Christina and Will in the movie, where in the book she viewed them more as competition and didn't seem to care about them. The characters came across more realistic than they did in the book.

I thought Shailene Woodley did very well in portraying Tris, the main character. And Theo James also did very well in bringing Four's mysterious & dangerous presence to the screen. Their chemistry was evident. Kate Winslet was a great choice to play Jeanine, the main antagonist. Jai Courtney and Miles Teller were great for the two mini-antagonists Tris encounters during her training.

A lot of people complain that Divergent isn't original. So what? Every story in some way shares a similarity with at least one other story. What's the saying? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

The acting had it moments but the love story was great and the progression of Four and Tris were perfect. It wasn't rushed, no swooning - thank goodness.

They spun  it and flipped them, and then crammed it all down our throats.
The film based on the novel by Veronica Roth  never explains its premise and rips off far too many better books, stories and movies. Trying to desperately compete with the popularity of the Hunger Games, the Liberal Media and the Hollywood Elite has produced a mirror image of themselves.  People that can not produce a original or creative idea if their lives depended on it. They can only produce stolen goods. This is more that a movie audience should be forced to tolerate.

There is a aptitude test game involved.  The test is to see if media propaganda and  $50 million spent on advertising, marketing and brainwashing for the Divergent movie is adequate enough to make the viewing audience dumb enough to spend money on rubbish.  At the same time they want us to pretend that Jennifer Lawrence in the Hunger Games does not exist.  Or, maybe Suzanne Collins stole all her ideas from Veronica Roth?

She enters a unisex ""Starship Troopers"" dorm where she will train and either make the grade or get cut and join the factionless beggars.

The production steals from a number of different pop culture iconic films/books. At times it was groan worthy. Having said that, I did enjoy the film, even while groaning through so many scenes. This was clearly aimed at teens, especially teen girls.

6104233,4,B00GQQ77IU,"This reviewer missed the book series this movie is based on, showed up with no expectations, and really enjoyed the movie. ""Divergent"" is a syfi thriller set in a post-Apocalyptic Chicago, where the population has been divided into five factions based on personality type. Teenagers are given an aptitude test before picking their lifetime faction. Failure to pick a faction, or failure to stay in one, dooms a person to a marginal existence.

The heroine is young Beatrice Prior, raised in the Abnegation faction, whose aptitude test is strangely inconclusive. When her time comes, she breaks from her parents to join the Dauntless faction of warriors. Boot camp for the Dauntless is quite challenging, but Beatrice, who now calls herself Tris, gets a helping hand from her handsome instructor Four, who has secrets of his own. Tris' rite of passage is a suspenseful and entertaining story all by itself, but there is more to come. Tris becomes aware of a secret plan by one of the factions to take over Chicago, a plan that involves wiping out another faction. She will find unexpected allies in her race against the clock to stop the slaughter of the innocent...

The movie runs two and a half hours, but some of this is required to set up the storyline. The cast is well-chosen, especially Shailene Woodley as the independent-minded Beatrice/Tris, and Theo James as the stoic and mysterious Four. Kate Winslet has an intriguing role as head of the Erudite faction, who takes an interest in Tris.

The fight scenes for the most part were entertaining. The training for dauntless was neat, and if anyone had seen Starship Troopers they will see a similarity in the training.  One of the disappointments I had with this film is the predictability of scenes. I know it not a real thinking moving, but we should not be able to tell what will happen for most of the film.

6104236,3,B00GQQ77IU,"Let's examine this without providing any Divergent (DV) spoilers...
First, why compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunger-Games/dp/B008602KQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunger Games</a>&nbsp;(HG)? It is difficult not to. Both are post-apocalyptic, take place in dystopias, ultimately embody the same messages, and target primarily the same viewership age. As a side note, I find it somewhat hopeful (rather than pessimistic) that the popular YA novels these films are based upon are set in these circumstances; it provides the opportunity for critical thinking about what our society should become, or more importantly, not become. Anyway, on to the contrasting...

 Action 
If action is what you want, you'll get it in DV, although you'll need to be patient. DV isn't an action film per se, so if action is what floats your boat, maybe consider another movie.
The Hunger Games had some intense fight-to-the-death scenes, but Divergent wins in the action category.

 Emotional impact 
Whereas HG tugs at your heartstrings with the death of Rue, DV somehow just didn't pull this off. Sure, people important to the protagonist are killed off in DV, but there was no parallel to the spreading flowers over Rue's body that worked so well in HG. Divergent does have more feel-good moments than HG, as when our heroine passes her many tests and wins her many battles.
Overall though, The Hunger Games wins in the emotional impact category.

 Plot 
The first hour is not all that impressive. It starts to come together after that (DV is a long film at 139 minutes; oddly enough, HG is almost exactly the same duration). They do an acceptable job of keeping you guessing about who is wearing a white hat and who a black hat, which is one reason the 2nd hour is more engrossing. It is difficult to tell from either film which underground movement (against the powers that be) is stronger. The resistance in DV seems weaker (as only a tiny percent of the population is divergent), but neither film goes into enough detail about this. I guess that's part of the problem with doing trilogy films based on books: we can hope more will be revealed later, but they may not be able to squeeze it in. If you are looking for a love story, DV will be your cup of tea. The central theme of HG was very creative, but ultimately the plot of DV is just more complex (and thus more engaging, at least for me). Despite its teen vibe and the unshakable notion that I've witnessed most elements of it in numerous sci-fi productions, Divergent wins.

 Actors 
Divergent did okay with casting, but HG did better. I have the benefit of being able to judge this without the bias of having read either of these YA novels. Jennifer Lawrence (HG) is difficult to beat as the central character, but Shailene Woodley (DV) also excels in her role as the girl who didn't ask to be a hero. It's practically a toss-up between the two films when taking into consideration all of the major and minor roles, but the caliber of actors seems to me superior in HG.

 Cinematography 
HG arguably had the better cinematography. DV did okay in its sets and locations, but the CGI distracted from the story at times.

 Urge to see next in the series 
I saw the sequel to HG as soon as possible, but I have to say I am looking forward more to the DV sequel due to the plot possibilities. HG feels limited as to where it can go, being based around the games.

So, which film is ""better""? That depends on what you want out of a film. If you are looking for an exact reproduction of the books on screen, then I have no idea. In the end it doesn't really matter which is better, since both films are worth watching. I rate them at 3.5 or 4 stars, with Hunger Games being marginally preferred.",1396569600,15,3798,4.770992366412214
6104237,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Not that that's a bad thing, especially since this and recent like it have been very well done (*). The dystopic society has been split into five ""factions,"" apparently forgetting just how badly that ""separate but equal"" thing has worked in our world. This system has built-in tensions, as one faction has control of the government, but a second faction takes control of the military, which itself is another faction. That all plays out well enough and, without the frustration of real cliff-hanger, paves the way for a sequel. Then there are those like our heroine, Tris, who lies outside any of the neatly defined roles demanded by the social power structure ...

Good one, on the whole. Plenty of action while staying close to the ""humanly possible"" range, interesting portrayal of the evil intellectuals, gritty ""basic training"" sequences - but I found the segregation of newcomers and natives inadequately explained. Likewise, the lack of hormonal involvement when teens of both sexes are thrown together in privacy-deficient living quarters. Especially when those young men and women are so whole-heartedly devoted to their physical selves, and to physical awareness of others. Oh, there's more than a hint of something simmering for Our Heroine, but it's surprisingly chaste - well, that's better than the pasted-on romantic involvements that so many movies suffer.

Good entertainment, but not one for the ages.

This movie is like a made for TV movie but with better visual, however, the story is predictable and tired...someone wants to take over the world, seen that a million time, nothing original here, big movie studio making a big deal out of nothing.",1396483200,2,629,4.26890756302521
6104239,5,B00GQQ77IU,"I read a lot of YA novels and I watch almost all of the movies that go along with the books and this has to by far be the best one. The casting was amazing. Shailene Woodley and Theo James did a great job as Tris and Four. They were pretty much exactly as I pictured them from the book.
I thought they did a really good job picking which moments from the book to put into the movie and that it would be pretty easy for people that have not read the book to figure out what is going on.
The only thing I wished there was more of were the little scenes here and there between Tris and Four. There were a few missing from the movie and I think if they had included a few more that it would have been easier to see how their relationship developed.
Overall the movie was full out just the right amount of action with a love story that did not overwhelm the rest of the movie.",1396483200,8,871,3.9545454545454546

I was happily surprised to find that, in this case, I actually preferred the movie to the book. While the book bogged down at times, the movie was nicely streamlined and entertaining and the chemistry between the two main characters was much more palpable than in the book.

The movie is set in a not-so-distant future where society has been divided into five factions, each with a principal driving philosophy. The amity are kind and grow the food, the erudite are intelligent and conduct research and science, the candor are honest and manage justice, the dauntless are brave and act as soldiers, and the abnegation are selfless and conduct charity and run the government. While it sounds like a utopian society, there are also the factionless . . . those that have no faction and roam the streets without purpose. And then there are the divergent . . . those that don't clearly fall into any of the factions. Do they represent a threat to the utopian society?

The acting was very good but Shailene Woodley was too physically big for the role of Tris (as bad as Tom Cruise being too small to play Jack Reacher even if he did a good acting job as did Woodley).  The film adaptation was bad in that if I hadn't read the book the film would have been hard to understand.  Too much was left out or sketched too lightly or just plain changed.  The pacing wasn't even either. The burgeoning relationship between the two main protagonist was just plain hokey though to be fair it was better than the book in that they spent a lot less time sighing, kissing and hugging -- teenage girls might love it but it was too gushy for me. I didn't see the film in an IMAX theater and I thought the focus was really fuzzy though cinematography was generally very good.  If you're a fan of the book(s) do go see it.

Ok. So I got back from seeing Divergent with the kids and a friend and I have to say I do not understand the hype. It's formulaeic with a silly premise. Fortunately, it's also really long.

The movie was just silly, I thought. There was so much that was just plain goofy... like why would these five factions create stability? Why would someone's personality make them immune to a drug? Why would you be banished (factionless) if you wanted to switch? Why can't you have a job and still talk to your family? I could go on, but the more I think about it, the more I think this was an awful movie made just to capitalize on the Hunger Games... kinda like the vampire craze that hit a few years ago. Perhaps the most ridiculous part of the movie was the conclusion: They just exposed a plot by one faction to eliminate another and saved yet another faction from becoming mind-controlled mass-murderers. So why do they have to run as if they are criminals? Because they are 'divergent?' For this being the core of the whole movie- and the title- it was never explained even a little why this is a bad thing.",1396137600,2,1139,4.444976076555024

Anyway, so seeing this movie without reading the book for me. This was really good.

6104249,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

While long removed from the film's young adult target audience, I like a good movie.  In particular, I'm always on the lookout for some science fiction opportunities.  In a not particularly new premise established here, we are set in a somewhat distant future Chicago.  The world, or at least Chicago, is in a crumbled state.  We're not sure what happened but the city is encircled in a giant electrified fence.  The humans have been living and working together but in 5 unique and distinct sects.  Each of the 5 are characterized by their primary human traits.

For example Dauntless or The Brave are the warrior-soldiers who protect the population.  Abnegation or The Selfless essentially run the government.  Erudite or The Intelligent are the scientists, the thinkers.  The others are Amity or The Peaceful and Candor or The Honest.  I found it interesting that each faction had to have its own dictionary definition to go along with its name.  Each year a group of teens are tested to determine which faction they are best suited for.  They don't have to go there - they can go anywhere - but there they must stay.

Our heroine, Beatrice/Tris (rising star Shailene Woodley), resides with her parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn) and her teen brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) as part of Abnegation.  After being tested by a sympathetic Tori (Maggie Q), it is determined that Tris has no specific faction she is cut out for.  People like this are called Divergents and are considered problematic by the Erudite.  These people are prime contenders to lead rebellions against the current way of life.  Tori advises Tris to keep the results to herself.  She would be in danger if found out.  Once at the decision point, Tris surprises everyone by choosing Dauntless.

She heads off for training immediately on the outskirts of the city.  She and others who defect from other factions are placed under the training tutelage of Four (newcomer Theo James).  The middle section of the film deals with the trials and tribulations of Tris's adaptation to a soldier lifestyle, something she obviously isn't prepared for.  But she is determined and smart and then there is Four.  He's also smart, tough and real cute.  The filmmakers don't hide much, showing that Tris has a big crush on her trainer.

The final act digs deeper into the Erudite's desire to control both the government and the people.  This means an overthrow of the Abnegation including Tris's father who is a councilman.  A serum has been developed in secret that will cause the Dauntless to mindlessly follow the orders of the controlling Erudite headed by Jeannine (Kate Winslet).  Tris and Four are unaffected by the serum and work together to pull the plug.  ""Divergent"" is an entertaining enough film.  It will certainly draw comparisons to the ""Twilight"" franchise and more closely to ""The Hunger Games.""  Is there room for more?  Well, we'll see, but I suspect yes.  Woodley and James work well together and are believable in their roles.  Sequel(s) are coming.  As far as this film.  It is much better than any of the ""Twilight"" films, but falls short of ""The Hunger Games"" in terms of content and production value.",1396051200,3,3225,4.878228782287823

The movie would be entertaining for a wider audience than just adolescent females; although, I imagine younger women would be able to relate better to the story and the protagonist.  I did not read the book, so my experience was of just the film.  It is for the premise I gave this a rating of four stars.  I wonder if the focus were more on the politics and the relationships between the factions, if this movie would have a greater appeal to a wider audience.  Then, I am sure many would bemoan the movie straying from the book and turning into a sci-fi drama.
I would enjoy seeing the premise explored further, even if it means straying from the book. Some details, seemingly trivial to some, may actually detract from the credibility or seem contradictory - for example (warning! possible spoiler for some) if Beatrice was raised in Abnegation, and she is not to even look at her image in the mirror for long since it is a sign of vanity, why is her hair frosted?  Would that not be considered vain?  There are other examples, but I tried to pick the most benign - Many unanswered questions (I want to know more about the mom, and the dad and the relationship between them, how one faction was able to convince leaders of another ... )

6104253,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Watched this in the theaters on a special cheap-o movie day, but it would probably have been worth a full price ticket.

First off, a disclaimer: I haven't read the Divergent books, so I cannot say how faithful the film is to the story, or if the feel is authentic to the author's vision.

That said, I could not help but compare Divergent to Hunger Games, as one success tends to breed a slew of offspring in the genre. Divergent feels like another YA dystopian sci-fi offering, much in the vein of Hunger Games--- girl grows up in alternate (or potential) future, in a post-semi-apocalyptic society. Due to political unrest, girl must endure hardship and survive in a brutal world, despite enemies and in order to protect loved ones.

Where the Hunger Games world felt fully fleshed-out, and the characters' stories were instantly more heart-wrenching, as they were in the thick of tragedy before the story began; the Divergent movie starts off with things seeming to be ""okay"" and the problems are slowly built up as the story progresses. The Divergent world feels a bit more shallow, has more plot holes and by the end of the film one is only just seeing Tris begin to come into her own.

I can't tell if this is because, having read the Hunger Games, I subconsciously filled in film-absent plot gaps with details from the novels, or if Divergent just isn't *quite* as good a series. It also felt like 75% of the Divergent film was a slow burn up to something more, but I really don't if the next two films will deliver without knowing the story line. I guess I am going to have to read the books and add an update to this review.

Bottom line: the film was entertaining, the acting was decent, the story shows promise and left me both curious to see the next film as well as wanting to check out the books--- which sounds like a fair success to me. I would watch it again, at least once.

Update: I finally read Divergent, and the other two books as well. I feel like the movie did a pretty good job of representing the book, but as often happens with film, there are bits left out which could have been helpful to the plot or to characterization. I wouldn't say any of the omissions really make the movie confusing, because I don't feel that wanting to question something or taking educated guesses at a mystery is confusing, but others might not like it. My guess is that the omissions from this film should be plenty clarified in the following segment. Lastly, I think the chosen actors all suited their roles. From YA book to movie I would say all the little ducks lined up in a pretty tidy row.",1395792000,10,2604,4.4831223628691985

I think that Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four) had amazing chemistry, and I was fangirling the whole time I was watching it. SO MUCH FOURTRIS FEELS IN THIS MOVIE. I love the way Theo James portrays Four, and I think they do an amazing job of showing Tris's character development from the beginning where she's a Stiff who is really innocent and meek to where she's a Dauntless badass who seems almost completely fearless.

I was a little worried about the casting - I've never heard of Shailene Woodley and didn't know if she could carry the movie but she was fantastic. She was emotional, believable, and best of all likable. I found myself empathizing with her and hoping she would succeed. I like the crackle of energy between her and Theo James.

6104259,5,B00GQQ77IU,"Divergent is a film based on Veronica Roths bestselling dystopian trilogy and its just as amazing as The Hunger Games, if not better. After a string of box-office misfires (Beautiful Creatures, The Host, Mortal Instruments), Hollywood was looking for the next big thing and Divergent truly fits the criteria.  Dont dismiss Divergent as just a Hunger Games wanna-be, this is by far the best movie of 2014, hands down.

  Divergent takes place in a post-apoclayptic Chicago in which society is divided into four factions to ensure that humanity can live on in peace and harmony. The five factions are Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), Abnegation (the selfless), Candor (the honest) and Erudite (the intellects) and on initiation day, teens are expected to choose a faction to live in for the rest of their lives. Beatrice Tris Prior recieves inconclusive test results because shes Divergent and she doesnt fit into her societys narrow categories. Tris chooses to join the Dauntless and she discovers that being brave will be the difference between life and death.

  Right off the bat, Divergent begins with a gorgeous panaroma of a dilapidated Chicago and from that moment on,  viewers know that this is no ordinary tale. Though the world of Divergent is extremely intricate, the filmmakers capture every single aspect of this society vividly. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a film that both fans of the book and newcomers alike can enjoy because all of the world-building and explanations are easy to comprehend and intriguing.

  Shailene Woodley plays the fierce, determined Tris and she really helps viewers understand what it means to be Dauntless. Though Tris isn't always as tough as she might like, viewers will fall in love with her despite her moments of insecurity and uncertainty. Hollywood needs to feature more strong female characters like Tris Prior that could serve as role models for generations of young women. The world doesnt need another Bella Swan, it needs more passionate, driven characters like Tris and Katniss Everdeen. Woodley is magnetic alongside her co-star, Theo James who plays the Dauntless instructor Four. The chemistry between the two is undeniable and its nearly impossible not to root for this couple and their relationship. Divergent makes the romance extremely engaging and their relationship helps mitigate the dark undertones of the Dauntless faction.

  With a thrilling mixture of action, adventure and romance, Divergent is executed perfectly and not a single moment in this film is meaningless.  Viewers will always be on the edge on their edge of their seats especially in the Simulation scenes and these scenes are equally terrifying as they are entertaining. Divergent is simply a must-see and its easy to see why millions have fallen in love with Tris and Four in Veronica Roths novels. Fans will come out of the theaters, dying to see Insurgent, the sequel to Divergent, and will practically be counting the seconds till its release. Divergent doesnt just live up to the hype, it exceeds the hype and raises the bar for sci-fi thrillers.",1395532800,,3111,5.084479371316307
6104260,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Nine Things about the Movie Divergent

1.  This film is based on the first book of the popular young adult trilogy of novels.

2. If you haven't noticed, contemporary young adult stories typically follow a set formula - an innocent kid joins a larger society and must be categorized. But then the kid discovers they are special, which causes problems for the society, and the kid must lose their innocence to survive in a dangerous world . Some recent examples are The Hunger Games, Enders Game, and the Harry Potter series. Divergent sticks to that exact same formula.

3. Just because you have seen this basic story multiple times does not mean the movie is bad. These kinds of stories are popular because it is the archetypal heros journey myth, and, if they are well-made, hit a nerve with us. Such movies can sometimes become classics - The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are other, older examples of pretty much the exact same story.

4. Thankfully, Divergent is well done, and holds its own among its cinematic peers. Its about a girl named Tris who takes a test (kind of like Harry Potters sorting hat or Enders training monitor) to discover which of five distinct factions she will become a member of (like Hogwarts Houses or the Zones in The Hunger Games). But she is so special that the test breaks, and nobody knows what to do with her (like all the stories I just mentioned). So she must trust her gut and decide in secret.

4. Tris chooses her faction and begins her training, but shes so gifted that she draws attention to herself, not only from her fellow classmates, but from her hunky instructor, too. And the leaders of another faction, who have controversial political aspirations.

5. The movie handles the usual themes well - conformity vs. independence, fear vs. bravery, and the trauma of growing up. But it also subtly asks a couple of bigger questions that are unfortunately not explored here; questions like What is human nature, anyway? and While conformity may seem bad, what would happen if we were all independent?.

6. The acting is decent, and the main characters have good chemistry. Thankfully, the movie delays the inevitable romance as long as it can, and tries not to let it get in the way of the bigger story.

7. Being aimed at young adults, there is not much blood or death, but some people may be surprised that there is a relatively high amount of violence, both explicit and implied.

8. The other two books, Insurgent and Allegiant, are expected to be made into movies and released in theaters in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

9. So yes, the story is old and predictable. No, Divergent won't become a timeless classic. But if you aren't just totally over this type of movie, its worth seeing. And it makes you realize why this same story keeps getting turned into movies over and over again: The issues that teenagers struggle with never go away. Mothers, fathers, sons and daughters are all dealing with the same existential problems. Only our perspective changes. And sometimes our choices.",1395532800,428,3056,4.704119850187266
6104261,5,B00GQQ77IU,I feel that it followed the book really well and was very action packed- good for all audiences.  Definitely worth owning! Already pre ordered digital copy!,1395446400,8,156,5.0
6104262,4,B00GQQ77IU,"Here is another series based on Veronica Roth's world-wide best-selling Young Adult trilogy. Again we have the alienated teenager in a post-apocalyptic world, which is divided into five disciplines: Candor (Honest); Abnegation (Selfless); Erudite (Intelligent); Amity (Peaceful); and Dauntless (Brave). Each faction has its own responsibility; this separation creates a smoothly running society.

Each young adult is tested so he or she will make an informed decision as they bet their life (kind of a Harry Potter Sorting Hat). Problem is, there are a few unusual folks who have aptitudes for more than one discipline ...to their great peril and they aren't allowed to change their mind! Our heroine could belong to three different factions, so her troubles begin...

We watch:
  * Shailene Woodley (""The Decendants"") is our heroine Tris, trying to fit in, despite her ""special mind."" She opts for the Dauntless faction even though her parents are Abnegation. (Her brother goes to Erudite.)
  * Theo James (he was that dead Turk in Lady Mary's bed in Season One of ""Downton Abbey"") is Four, a demanding Dauntless training instructor.
  * Kate Winslet (""Labor Day"") is the icy Christine Matthews; she utterly believes in the system.
  * Zo Kravitz (""After Earth"") is Christina, a sweet colleague who, like Tris, is just trying to survive.
  * Ray Stevenson (""Thor""); Marcus Eaton wants forgiveness from his absent son.
  * Ashley Judd (""Dolphin Tale"") is Natalie Prior, our heroine's mother.
  * Tony Goldwyn (""Scandal"") is Andrew Prior, her father.

This is far more ""Hunger Games"" than ""Twilight,"" in that we have a strong heroine who doesn't wait to be rescued. In addition, our heroine has to work hard to develop her skills, like Katniss in ""Hunger Games,"" not just be born beautiful like Bella.

Director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") never loses sight of the PG-13 rating, we can expect some gunfire, martial arts and a teeny bit of profanity, but no sweaty bodies, e.g., our heroine tells a would-be lover, ""I want to take it slow."" The YA bones show, but that is to be expected. The young gals in the audience seemed to have a splendid time, and I did NOT suffer! Amazon has (as of 03-22-14) a pre-order link for the DVD.

6104263,4,B00GQQ77IU,"In a futuristic postwar Chicago, society is divided into five factions based on individuals' defining characteristic or interest, from courage to honesty to intelligence and so on.  By extension, each serves a well-defined purpose, from policing to scientific research.  Placement is determined through mental testing, and those who do not find their rightful place are either murdered or lead lives of desperation on the street.  Such is the high concept of Divergent, which focuses in particular on a teenage girl, Beatrice or ""Tris,"" who discovers her mind contains elements of each faction and tries at first to hide this to avoid becoming a target of her city's overbearing, even dangerous government.  On the surface, the idea is rather preposterous since each person has more than one dimension and an interior life of many colors:  for instance, a policeman's duty requires at least a degree of curiosity and wit, not just drive-on, no-question nerve.  At the same time, however, the idea has a certain charm, viewed through teenage eyes in particular:  does not every adolescent at one point or another believe he or she is a lone complex soul in a sea of conforming friends and, worse still, adults (parents, perhaps, or teachers) demanding a safe, well-defined plan for the future?  Here this sweet byproduct of youthful navel-gazing is cast as an outsize science-fiction action/adventure saga, and the result is highly entertaining.

Director Neil Burger, whose previous credits include Interview with the Assassin and The Illusionist (with Edward Norton), has a potent visual style and understands how to stage set pieces with agility, atmosphere, and clarity.  He has particular fun with the many sequences which find the heroine undergoing mental examination, rendering her very imagination as a perilous and ever-shifting space on the screen; it even becomes a literal hall of mirrors at one point.  And in the lead role, one which both she and her agent no doubt hope will elevate her closer to Jennifer Lawrence status, Shailene Woodley is convincing in her portrayal of fragility giving way to ferocity as Tris' physicality hardens alongside her resolve to survive and rebel.  A capable ensemble further shade the film and, in the case of Kate Winslet as the icily regal antagonist, lend it an air of prestige.  The film, I concede, loses a bit of focus and flair in its final 25 minutes as if it realizes how long it is and begins racing toward the end credits.  As a result, the final confrontations are not as riveting as the earlier ones despite having grander implications.  Overall, though, this is a persuasive start to what I hope will become a worthwhile trilogy.",1395446400,,2691,5.070294784580499

8626246,3,B00GQQ77IU,"As much as I enjoyed the visual translation of many things in the book, like the costumes and technology and the Pit... I found this movie frustrating. The acting is wooden, the actors playing Tris & Four completely lack chemistry, the relationship between Will & Christina is completely ignored, and certain important aspects about the simulations were changed in a way that didn't make sense for the Dauntless - they are about courage, not finding a way out of things.",1530489600,,470,4.8875
