7807068,3,6300248321,"Great writing (Judd Klinger, top feature screenwriter) and funny delivery from comedian Charlie Barnett (featured regularly on blockbuster cop action TV series, ""Miami Vice.""), but some of the interstitials were a bit sophomoric. Good time capsule for stand-up comedy. This guy greatly influenced new comedians like Dave Chappelle.",1361404800,,331,5.916666666666667
