4155148,3,B003M986TS,"This is a good attempt to show the effects that depression can have on a person and her family.  While perhaps not always like this, each person's illness is different in its manifestations.  This society is sorely lacking in understanding that folks who suffer from depression are not able to just push themselves through it.  It doesn't work that way.  Although the acting was average, it was a lot better than many films I've seen lately.",1331683200,4,441,4.7631578947368425

4155150,5,B003M986TS,"This movie really hits home with what people that suffer from clinical depression go through, and how they shut out those that love them most, through no fault of their own, and how family members are helpless to help them.  The struggle to overcome inner demons and depression is a road that is not understood by those who do not know how debilitating this illness can be. Ashley Judd gives an outstanding performance as the professor, and Goran Visnjic is so incredibly believable as her husband, who tries to reach her and help her out of her abyss.  Lauren Lee Smith plays Mathilda, Helen's student who loses her mother to the same condition, and suffers from the same depression portrays her character as the lone person that is able to understand Helen,  through support and presence - Excellent.",1307145600,25,802,4.797101449275362

4155153,5,B003M986TS,This is a great movie about a subject few want to know about and to which there is huge stigma.  Very realistic about what it is like to have depression.,1286755200,4,153,4.1
4155154,4,B003M986TS,"This movie is about a young married woman with a teenaged daughter who at first shows herself as calm and well poised. She is gifted with the ability to play piano and to teach music to college age students. Her husband is an attorney who loves her and they have a happy upper class family life. All seems normal and a desired goal by most standards of the population. Helen is a gentle soft-spoken female who is played by Ashley Judd. This was a character role that seemed different than I have seen Ashley play at. She has acted in some movies as a strong role model, yet in Ruby she was a reflective quieter actor, still there was strength. This role was taking a well-adjusted person into a dark despairing spiral of depression and inability to cope with the world around her. The meltdown went really quickly, which didn't feel quite right. Her symptoms just came on. The trigger seemed to be her husbands manner at work one morning and a girl student she met late nite at her academy. It is hard to know for certain if thats what set her out of control feelings to surface. The rest of the movie is how she deals with the imbalance in her emotional status. She tends to try a medical route or her husband does. She seems to just be led by his decisions until finally striking out against him and those wanting to see her change. She seems to want to be accepted as is. Her lack of involvement with life is to hard for her family to watch, they want to pull her out of the feelings rather than support her process. She meets up with the artistic cello playing student who also suffers from the havoc of feelings. They bond yet her depression does not change, it is a shared connection that allows her to be herself rather than a wife or a mother. She is still holding onto the pain and using drugs to escape with sleep, but she can be in this place without any requirements to change. Her decision to take medication and let the hospital adminster ect happens from her own volition. She makes this choice somehow from the process of her unfolding depression without any pressure placed upon her. I don't like her direction of healing but I do like that she decided to act and bring forth change to her life. Change in any way brings new direction and choices to us as individuals. The things I liked about this film, I liked the reflection and processing that took place after I viewed this movie, I liked her beautiful house and all the pretty dishes, I liked the good coffee that she drank with her expensive coffee machine, I liked that she ran thru the anonomyous streets and I liked her softness and creativity with music. Another thing I liked was her connection with the younger student. It was real and love seemed to sprout from it. They had each others understanding, it wasn't meant to last forever, because change needed to happen but while it was, it felt true and meaningful to both girls. A very good film yet not the approach I would meander down.",1282262400,8,2968,4.427787934186472
4155155,5,B003M986TS,"Sandra Nettlebeck both wrote and directed this somber, intense study about clinical depression.  The film is long, is a one-note song, and is in need of editing and lightening - or is it?  What Nettleback has created is an atmosphere that very likely simulates the way the world is viewed and coped with by those who are suffering from suicidal depression.  It is a lesson as much as it is a film.

Helen (Ashley Judd) is a popular professor of music theory, and accomplished pianist, and the wife of handsome and successful lawyer David (Goran Visnjic), and mother of a charming teenager Julie (Alexia Fast) all of whom we meet at a surprise birthday party for Helen.  But very gradually Helen begins to change from the ebullient happy woman to a more quiet, pensive, obviously injured woman.  Concentration fails, she cannot get enough sleep, her connection to the world begins to crumble and finally she breaks into the depths of depression.  Despite the support of David and Julie and denying the medical assistance of psychiatrist Dr. Sherman (Alberta Watson), Helen continues to sink deeper into the profound sadness of clinical depression.  One of Helen's students, Mathilda (Lauren Lee Smith) seems to be one of the few people with whom Helen can relate: we are lead to discover Mathilda suffers from a similar disorder.  The truth about Helen's medical history finally surfaces: she has had suicidal ideation and clinical depression in her past When married before to Frank (David Hewlett) and soon after the birth of Julie (?postpartum depression?) Helen required psychiatric hospitalization, her marriage failed, and she ultimately met David who has been the ideal husband and father for Julie. Helen escapes her home, is hospitalized and undergoes shock therapy after a suicide attempt - her only apparent understanding contact is the nebulously drawn Mathilda.  How Helen emerges from her illness and reorganizes her life is the ending of the film.

The film benefits greatly from the moody musical score by Tim Despic with the aid of James Edward Barker ( and Schumann and Schubert...) and the mood is kept appropriately dark by the cinematography by Michael Bertl.  The quartet of actors - Judd, Visnjic, Smith, and Fast) - are outstanding as is the well selected group of actors for supporting roles.  But for this study of the depths of depression - mostly dark scenes of Helen lying in bed or weeping - is, at two hours, a bit more than an audience can handle.  In order to appreciate the quality of this film the viewer must accept the fact that the main point of the film is a study of the crippling illness of depression. And that it does extremely well.

4155156,2,B003M986TS,"Nothing more than an infomercial for Big Pharma and shock treats. Like those things can actually cure the sick? What nonsense! Ashley Judd used to be a pretty good actor but lately with all her political activist craziness, she is a has-been shouting profanity from her nasty mic. She became a ""nasty woman"" in the eyes of many Americans and is an insult to women like myself.

I wouldn't waste another dime on her books or movies. I guess when no one wants to see your face on the big screen, go take to the streets and become a ""nasty women"" against our President. Wow...what a loser.",1485129600,,586,4.4766355140186915

4155176,5,B003M986TS,"This movie depicts mental illness in a clearer way than most. I did not feel that it was over the top, and felt it was more relative to how one feels and experiences depression and the onset of it. I did not like the parts with the younger girl bonding with her better and then what happened with her, it was a bit too theatrical- but the reason why Helen bonded with her more than ever her own husband was great. It shows the troubles one can have when their partner has no experience with mental illness. It shared how depression can cause one to isolate themselves from others who haven't a clue. Helen stuck to the younger girl who also experienced issues, because she was the only person she could truly relate to and have an understanding with. How a sufferer attempts to hide it and fight it until it becomes too much of a struggle to juggle on their own is also depicted.",1455235200,3,879,4.333333333333333

It specifically shows how caregivers/loved ones can take on the burden and guilt of the illness but it also assures the audience that it is not their fault or their job to ""fix"" the person with the illness, hence why spouses should watch it and know they are not alone; patience, love and support is all that is needed.",1441065600,,682,4.619834710743802

4155237,5,B003M986TS,"Helen is a drama starring Ashley Judd and Goran Vinji together with Lauren Lee Smith,Alexia Fast,Alberta Watson and Leah Cairns. The film follows a professor who overcomes severe depression after a massive breakdown with the help of new friend. It was directed by Sandra Nettelbeck.

This psychological drama centered on the monumental inner struggle of Helen, a successful music professor and happily married mother suffering from severe mental illness. After years of suppressing her bipolar disorder, Helen suffers a crippling emotional breakdown. Subsequently hospitalized, she befriends Mathilda, who offers a sense of understanding and emotional solace that her family cannot. But in time Helen's suffering becomes overwhelming, and she begins to believe that death is the only solution. Desperate, Helen's husband and daughter fight to prove to her that life is worth living, and convince her that there are other options for overcoming her illness.

What is wonderful about the film is that it keenly conveys the profound isolation of mental illness and the futility of searching for someone, or something, to blame. In roles that could have devolved into arias of melodrama, the cast never overplays its hand, fighting the omnipresent melancholy in small ways rather than large. I gave it the highest rating because of this.",1433548800,3,1333,5.403846153846154

It stuns me each time I watch it, both with it's heartbreakingly beautiful story, and with the lush, gorgeous cinematography and music used in it. It's a well-paced, quiet film, but the story itself is anything but quiet. Judd's performance in this film is incredible, her best in my opinion, and her portrayal of the inescapable pain of severe depression screams throughout the entire film.

Drawing on her own personal experience with depression and the stigma  that surrounds it, Ms. Judd takes us on a roller coaster ride to hell and back that is both disturbing and moving. I highly recommend it to anyone like Helen who has the courage to finally see that she is not a bad person trying to become good but a sick person trying to get well.

4155316,2,B003M986TS,"Helen (Sandra Nettlebeck, 2009)

Ashley Judd is singularly excellent at playing people who are about to break down, in the process of breaking down, or have just broken down. I'm not sure what, if anything, that says about Ms. Judd's personal life, but it does make many of her performances schadenfreude-style treats when consumed on the big screen. And the first thirty-odd minutes of Sandra Nettlebeck's Helen are described perfectly by this. Unfortunately, the movie runs two hours.

Plot: Helen (Judd) and David (ER's Goran Visnjic) are a seemingly happy couple whose life couldn't be better--that is, until Helen begins changing. It's not much of a spoiler to tell you that she's sliding into depression (like I said, this stage of the film is its first quarter, give or take). And we're not talking rainy-day blues here, we're talking crippling, life-threatening depression. She eventually hits bottom and deserts her family--and her doctor--to bond with Mathilde (Lie with Me's Lauren Lee Smith), a similarly-affected former student of hers, while David tries to figure out what went wrong and how to make it better.

It's impossible to get into the meat of why the last three-quarters of the movie don't work without what some may consider spoilers, though they have to do with the experience of depression rather than things specific to the film, so I will throw in a spoiler alert here and let the reader beware. The problem is that ""what went wrong"" is, as will be instantly recognizable by anyone who has lived through this kind of depression or lived with someone who has lived through this kind of depression, the wrong question entirely to be asking. I have no doubt that was Nettlebeck's point; the problem is that if her intention was to portray the ineffectual nature of David's quest leading to almost causing his own breakdown, she perhaps did it too well, as watching it is almost as frustrating as living it. One review I read of the film recently said this is a lesson as much as it is a movie. Indeed. And the didactic nature is liable to grate on anyone who already knows the answer.

Still, Ashley Judd's performance in the first part of this movie does make this worth watching, though I think you'd be forgiven for deciding to turn it off halfway through. **",1366934400,2,2287,4.826530612244898

THe movie is worth the watch just for that fact alone. I have to admit, I was determined to stick it out through the whole thing. Glad I did.",1357084800,7,294,4.267857142857143
4155319,5,B003M986TS,"Writer and director Sandra Nettelbeck puts forth a piece of excellence, adding to it a musical orchestration (Tim Despic and James Barker) featuring a cello with its hauntingly mournful song underscoring an individual study of overwhelming mental illness.  The cinematography (Michael Bertyl) starts with a little light and grows ever cloudy and dark as does the entire movie while spiraling downward along with Helen.

The character development of Helen is extraordinary and meticulously portrayed by Ashley Judd.  Goran Visnjic portrays David as the most caring, frustrated, bewildered and equally supportive husband to Helen. Mathilda (Lauren Lee Smith) has you constantly questioning if there will ever be a life worth living for her. Needless to say, this movie is dark, painful and extremely reflective. It explores a topic that some may wish to turn their heads from and others, like me, are exceedingly interested in.  This is not an easy view but an intense look into a very pervasive issue.

Helen is a college professor of music married to her second husband David, an attorney.  She has a teenage daughter from her first marriage.  At first blush, this family looks like your every day happy trio. Until something happens to Helen which causes her to begin acting completely out of character. She starts losing track of time, forgetting what has been transpiring with her class and losing the context of the lectures she is giving while speaking. As Helen is walking down the college hallway, she notices a lit room with a beckoning cello being played and curiously walks inside. One of her students, Mathilda, is all upset that she ""just cannot get it right"".  The music isn't to her liking.  Helen has a pull unawares toward her as does Mathilda at the same time.

David is noticing so many concerns at home and is very anxious about Helen's inability to sleep or eat. She has forgotten how to play the piano as she once did brilliantly. He finds her just sitting in her car late at night and crying. Helen walked right out of a restaurant during a meal with co-workers for no apparent reason and begins having panic attacks. These are just a few examples of her changes in behavior.

Mathilda is running a parallel in her own life as they both end up hospitalized.  David can no longer handle all of this at home, even with taking a leave of absence from work. Helen remains indivisible from Mathilda as David's jealousy is piqued. She has completely withdrawn into herself and shuts out her husband. Only the fragile Mathilda is allowed to share in Helen's life at this point, as they can empathize while going through similar situations. After leaving the hospital, Helen's life is whirling out of control as the agony she feels cannot be expunged.  During a desperate night of relentless anguish, Helen makes an attempt at taking her life.

This sets up the movie in all that is to follow. With that said I will leave the story here as Helen goes on to face the most ruthless combatant of her life.  Its name is Clinical Suicidal Depression.",1348790400,17,3059,4.833333333333333

The movie around her however is...  so. so. so. slow - appropriately, at first, I thought, for the subject matter, but then - it just feels so much longer than it actually is.  Often I  felt it was that the actors around her were, though in some cases very good, just too often for some reason, not very believable or watchable - in the smaller roles particularly.  So maybe it was the direction, the script -- something just didn't measure up to the rich gravitas of Ashley Judd's performance. I wasn't as touched as I wanted to be at all, and it wasn't her fault - something as a movie rang false, though the ramifications of real depression rang true.
