8749303,5,B01B582EZO,"This coming of age film from Mexican writer/director Carlos Cuaron (most familiar for Y Tu Mama Tambien  a very sexy youth film from 2001 really drew me in. It follows post pubescent Nacho  who lives with his mother and step father (who sells pirated merchandise in a market) and his step brother and step=sister (a nasty duo) as he tries to survive in one of the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in Mexico City. His hormones are raging when he spots a young girl and pursues her. But she has problems at home too (I won't tell you more  itll spoil your enjoyment). There is no nudity but there is graphic language (of course translated into English in some of the easiest to read subtitles Ive seen  KUDOS to Strand Releasing for those!

Its interesting that much of the score of the film is Beethoven piano concertos. But, honestly, it works. Theirs is some Mexican music  and a great pop song over the end credits.

If you like independent foreign films, I think you like this one.

There is a nice 15-minute Behind The Scenes featurette  watch AFTER you see the film  which shows how hard it was for the filmmakers to film on location.

One note of caution. I had a problem playing the DVD in my Sanyo Bluray player but it played fine in another regular-DVD player. I cant explain why but I thought I should point this out.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
