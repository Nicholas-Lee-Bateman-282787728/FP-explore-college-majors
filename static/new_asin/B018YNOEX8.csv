8743422,3,B018YNOEX8,"Well, I really wanted to love this movie (those trailers can get expectations so high), but have to admit it wasn't that memorable at all for me. Too much dysfunction and confusion for my liking. I didn't think it was a complete waste of time, and even got a few laughs out of it, but it's definitely not a movie I would want to watch again.",1459209600,,341,4.181818181818182

8743424,1,B018YNOEX8,Wow... All the scenes worth watching are in the trailer and was shown for the first 10 minutes of the film.  After that it went all downhill.  The characters were unrelatable and the plot was hard to grasp on at different times.  Save your money and skip this film.,1457827200,2,265,4.36734693877551
