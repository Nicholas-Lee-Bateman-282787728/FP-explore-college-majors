1330853,4,B00003IPF9,"This is a wonderful picture about some of indie rock's most eccentric stars. The live rooftop performance of ""1,000,000 kisses"" is  worth the price of admission alone. And Jay Fair's explanation of ""How  to play guitar"" may cause you to wet yourself with delight. Have  napkins close for the tears of laughter and joy. If you like indie rock  check this out. My only complaint is all of the major label bashing. It is  rather pointless in this context. There is also some blow hard DJ type who  disses the Beatles (! ). As does someone who negatively reviewed this DVD,  but he appears to hate almost everything except the J Geils Band's (?)  first album. Bwahahahahahahaha! BUY BUY BUY!",969408000,4,687,4.666666666666667
1330854,5,B00003IPF9,"Some day the Fair brothers will be spoken about in the same breath as Woody Guthrie and Elvis. They are pure American treasures worthy of having their heads put on stamps. Especially if the stamps aren't perfect  rectangles. You need to see this documentary. For extra credit check out  ""Daniel Johnston & Jad Fair .""",964137600,3,317,4.745454545454545
1330855,1,B00003IPF9,"The leader of this joke band is very intense. But I wonder what his day job is. Alot of underground music critics and luminaries are on this tape, so that means Half Japanese were able to entertain them. It is unlikely  that very many others will be able to share in the joke, since a big part  of the joke is that all popular music is trash. Sort of a statistical joke,  I guess. The leader of this band looks like Norman Bates on happy pills. He  sings in a whiney voice and always seems to be on the verge of swallowing  his adnoids. Unless you are already one of the initiated, it's unlikely  you'll enjoy tis video.",954288000,2,620,4.211864406779661
1330856,5,B00003IPF9,"I love this movie. I love this band. Some people may think that Half Japanese, as well as this movie, is all a joke.  Little do they know that Half Japanese could easily take over the planet.  While the movie focuses  on the entire career of Half Japanese, the most interesting story is how  Charmed Life got released.  Or didn't get released for 4 years after the  completion date. The early home movies of Half Japanese performing are  hilarious and incredibly heart-warming, especially the footage at the  retirement home.  After watching this moving it is easy to see how many  bands have been influenced Half Japanese.  Jad and David Fair are true  indie kings.",953856000,4,666,4.745614035087719

7918898,2,B00003IPF9,"This film is weirdly obsessed with why the band isn't as popular as mainstream music. It spends most of the film railing against the music industry rather than the band itself. The band exists in contrast to mainstream music. It parodies and plays off of it. The filmmaker is so far off the mark in making this film that it is really depressing. Lovely interview with Penn Gillette, and that's the best part of the film. Nice interviews with the guys but all too short. ALL of the stuff about the ""industry"" is a waste of time and a damn shame...and totally misses the point.",1308355200,,575,4.485714285714286
7918899,5,B00003IPF9,"This is great!  It harkens me back to the days when one of my friends and I used to record music in the back house of my parent's place, when we were in the early stages of our continuous learning.  True, they don't follow many of the acts today who use pitch correction in the studio, but that's the appeal to me.  What's fresh about it is the rawness of their music and their lack of arrogant posturing.  I don't mind the air of ""coolness"" and ""mysteriousness"" that many of the popular acts today try to maintain in their image/presentation, but sometimes I just want to break away from that facade, which Half Japanese seems to do, dump the ""coolness"" and just play.  To those who say they can't play, listen to the ""Charmed Life"" album.  Sure, they're no virtuosos, but neither were the Ramones (who ended up in the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame).  I've played guitar for well over 20 years and have played in quite a few bands as well as done studio work for various musicians, and I'll tell you that the musical skill to create ""Charmed Life"" is beyond any of the Ramones' stuff (and I'm a die hard Ramones fan).  So, if you hail the Ramones but whine about Half Japanese's musicianship, then you're full of it (or just a non-musician who thinks he knows how to judge musicianship).",1232755200,3,1283,4.452991452991453

7918901,3,B00003IPF9,"The documentary is OK...a lot less Penn Gillette would have been nice...but your response to the movie is going to be determined by what you think of the band and its music...whether you like the music or see it all as a big hipster joke of some kind.

I think what the people who have such a negative response don't grasp is how much the critics interviewed respond to the emotional purity of Half Japanese. Let's face it, the idea that rock'n'roll is about transcendent poetry and musicianship has always been and (God willing) will always be absurd. Rock'n'roll is about emotion, and bands like Half Japanese get much closer than most mainstream bands to expressing emotion in an unfettered way.

I think it's disingenuous to say that Jad Fair can't ""write"" lyrics, but other than that, I'll concede that not everything is for everyone. Tastes differ. I don't think that makes anyone really smart or really stupid though. It's just a matter of taste. We'd all do well to keep that in mind.",1211155200,,992,4.695402298850575
7918902,1,B00003IPF9,"For as long as I've been listening to music or reading books, there has been a tendency among too many folks I've met to seek out and praise the obscure and unknown. ""You like 'The World According to Garp'? Indeed, Irving is a fine writer, but his earlier book, 'Setting Free the Bears' captures, I think, his promise...his insights, and his, his, oh, what's the word, his grasp, his utter grasp of relationships, far more effectively."" You know the sort. If something is popular, it is inferior, flawed, commercial, mass-produced slop dished out in a trough for undiscriminating porkers. (Who, by the way, live in ""Little Boxes."") The unpopular however, now that's worth investigating, and the more eagerly it is unpopular, the more fascinating it becomes.

'Half Japanese' a ""band"" without discernible talent, for some unknown reason, hit the unpopular-is-popular lottery. This tedious and gratingly pretentious film documents this ""great band"" and their history, mercifully keeping the performances to a minimum and never allowing the bloated talking heads to explode with their own wisdom on screen. I guess I'm just not smart enough to understand why guys who can't play their instruments, can't sing, can't write, and can't perform can be the greatest band ever, while the Beatles and the Stones are cast aside with disdainful disgust. Now, I'm not a big fan of either John/Paul or Mick, but I know they produced many quality songs over the years. Not once however during this 90 minute pimple did anyone explain what makes Half Japanese so great. I just heard it repeated over and over and over and over and, well, you get the idea. If I was supposed to see it from their performance snippets, I missed it. If it is just a big joke, comprehensible only to those in the know, well as with the films of Ed Wood, I avoid bad art.

Giving hope to the untalented and self-important everywhere, Half Japanese was like sticky, cold rice. Unappetizing, nasty, and irritating.",1199750400,5,1974,4.924924924924925
7918903,1,B00003IPF9,"I started watching this DVD with wide eyed anticipation and an open mind.

And then I watched it..

This documentary just seems to drag on slowly, like trying to run over a five lane railroad track with chains and weights around your body; three trains barreling toward you in both directions. Not to mention a rabid rhino in there just to confuse you.

Save your money and buy something else.",1181088000,2,393,4.585714285714285
7918904,4,B00003IPF9,"I was totally enthralled by this DVD because I had never heard of this band and the whole time I was watching it I was thinking to myself that this is a mock-documentary and a genius one at that. Then it dawned on me that no one could have made this up even though the lead singer, I think his name was Rad, seemed to be sent from central casting to play the part of a sort of idiot savant, misunderstood genius, anti-hero, Peter Pan pop singer.

What I liked about this documentary is that they kept going back to the band performing songs. Which are hard to tell whether they are joke or genius.

We are still trying to figure out if ""Half Japonese"" is an urban myth.

The talking heads in this movie, expressing their bitterness over the fact that this band never made it big are also from central casting and really add the spice to this film.",1174435200,,847,4.248447204968944
7918905,2,B00003IPF9,This is a documentary about crazy people-not Half Japanese.  Most of the so-called critics can't remember a damned thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of Jad while continuously ranting about their major-label conspiracy theories.  Penn Jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homeless person out of Jad's material and then threatened Jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy.  If you're interested in mental illness and sleazy people like Penn Jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this.  If you're interested in a great American rock band then just buy the albums and listen.,1124496000,,655,4.981651376146789
7918906,3,B00003IPF9,"Please, before the rotten vegetables start flying, I'm in no way disparaging the brilliance of Half Japanese by low-balling this documentary. I just think there are glaring flaws abounding here. To start with, the film almost completely whitewashes over the music and era that really made the band unique. They talk at length about 1/2 Gentlemen/Not Beasts, but we hear none (or next to none) of the music!! We get a few seconds of ""Calling All Girls"" and some live versions of ""Firecracker Firecracker,"" and then suddenly we're in Jad's indie-rock later period. All of Jad's ""Zany"" later songs about Walt Disney and his wholesome songs about dating Juanita and her red dress are emphasized, while his completely seminal work, which revealed a much greater fear of being hurt by women, is ignored. You're going to play ""This Could Be The Night"" but totally avoid ""Nicole Told Me"" or ""I Know How It Feels...bad""??!?! It's this love/terror mix that makes Jad such a complex artistic figure. Nearly all the music covered is from the Charmed Life/Band That Would Be King era, which is apparently all the thing for certain 1/2 Jap fans, but c'mon, we don't ever hear word (or sound) one about the ""Loud"" album!
Finally, with the exception of Penn Jilliette, who's at his best here, the lesson we seem to learn from this film is that Half Japanese fans are professional feebs. I can't think of a worse triumvirate to shower praises on this great band than pucker-holes like Byron Coley, Phil Milstein, and the king of all that is wrong with independent music, Gerard Cosloy (No great music has been released on a major label? Warner Brothers put out the Gang of Four's ""Entertainment!"" Tell me, how's that new Matmos album coming, foolio?). Are there no decent people who like 1/2 Japanese? I mean apart from Penn and David Greenberger?
This is a must-see documentary in that 1/2 Japanese are a must-hear band, and Jad and David really are the best people to tell their own stories. And what great stories they are! Proceed with all due caution, but enjoy the beams of pure unrefracted kindness and sweetness that crack through the cynical hipster overcoat that's haphazardly thrown over the subject matter.",1000857600,12,2201,4.8563829787234045
