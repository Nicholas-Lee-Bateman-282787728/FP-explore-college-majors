6444638,5,B00KS47SNU,"The Walking Dead is an original series that is aired on AMC (American Movie Channel) every Sunday night.  The shows main characters include Andrew Lincoln playing the lead role of Rick.  There is also Daryl Dixon, playing a major role as Daryl, and there are also many other characters important to the plot.  The show is all about how Andrew Lincolns character, Rick, a police officer, gets injured, goes into a coma, and when he awakes finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.  After finding his family, Rick sets out with his group to find a safe place to live and survive the zombie nightmare.  The Walking Dead is a show that will have its viewers coming back every week for more.
 The show has been very successful because of the audiences ability to emotionally relate to the characters of the show and imagine themselves in the same exact situation as them, fighting to survive through a zombie apocalypse.  On the premiere of season 5 for The Walking Dead, the show received an enormous 17.3 million viewers making in the most watched drama series telecast in basic cable series history. The idea of being in a zombie apocalypse and fighting to survive is a highly popular topic in todays culture.  The show is very suspenseful putting you on the edge of your seat anxiously waiting to see what will happen next.  The show is very well written and the story line is solid.  The writers do a good job of not throwing random scenes in just to improve ratings, but keep every move they make relative to increase the story line of the show.
 I highly recommend The Walking Dead to anyone.  The show is appropriate for almost any age group above the age of 15.  The Walking Dead is addictive and will have you dying for more.",1414713600,10,1740,4.574193548387097

6444666,5,B00KS47SNU,"One of the most popular shows on TV today. I bought the box set to be able to catch up at my convenience. Cheaper buying the box set than buying the seasons individually.

There is just the perfect mixture of violence, scare factor, death, and story line in this series that as soon as I started watching, I knew it was going to be a show for me. If you aren't partial to violence, blood, gore, and etc, then I don't recommend this show for you. But who knows, you might surprise yourself!",1441065600,,441,4.2

6444677,1,B00KS47SNU,The video quality is poor on seasons 1-3 and extremely poor on season 4. Why do they think they can sell such shoddy products? I've seen crystal clear bootleg products of the Walking Dead but wanted an original set. What a disappointment. And I already gave the bootlegs away! I lost 2x.,1438560000,2,287,4.538461538461538

6444680,5,B00KS47SNU,"""The Walking Dead"" is a phenomenon in art/pop culture. Its like being struck by lightning. Imagine being lucky enough to experience Mozart's music during his life, reading one of Walt Whitman's poems when first published, seeing ""I Love Lucy"" in it's original series run (for examples)!  ""TWD"" is the perfect blend of passionate artistic expression and magnificent commercial appeal; accessibility and success.  Its a soap opera, its sci-fi about the end of the world via disease/zombies, its about a ""family"" fighting to survive against insurmountable odds, etc. It is extremely harsh/disgusting. But its also beautiful because when you become a fan, you will feel every emotion humanly possible (good and bad); question how you look at life; all while being entertained by the tornado-like lives of this stories characters. Worth noting-this ""show"" started in 2003 as a comic book by the same title. As a result, it has years of fresh material to work with. As a fan of this show (and other soaps), it will be interesting to see if its makers continue to be so thrilling and original. Lets hope so! Dont miss out on the revolution-revaluation of ""The Walking Dead""!",1437609600,,1167,5.041450777202073

6444718,5,B00KS47SNU,"The Walking Dead is one of the most liked shows on TV. This show has five seasons to it so far. This wonderful show is all about survival and trying to stay alive. The Walking Dead is an interesting show because the acting is amazing, it has excellent characters, and the whole story to the show has amazing scenes. You kill or you die or you die and you kill. That is what life is like for the characters on The Walking Dead.
  Over all, I would recommend this show to anyone that isn't afraid of seeing killing and blood. The Walking Dead show is so outstanding because of the actors they picked, the character development, and all the amazing scenes. Fight the dead, fear the living. You never know what the living will do, but at least you know that the dead will kill you.",1427673600,2,777,4.315068493150685

I received the order quickly and it arrived well packaged with all 4 seasons wrapped in their original packaging. I don't usually like slasher type flicks so I avoided watching the first few seasons. Then I saw a few episodes of Season 4 and got hooked. I love the story and plot lines. Lots of good characters. Walking Dead is awesome and this 4 season set helped me to get caught up on the series. Lots of extras on the DVD's. Well worth the purchase.,1426982400,4,525,4.313131313131313

It's been too frustrating!  For a fan, it's been so disappointing.  I have missed the very first show each time it's been on TV and so was very excited about finally seeing it. Bummer!

6444735,4,B00KS47SNU,"I received this last week and have been watching. I'm completely satisfied with the series itself but what brought me here to leave a review is the DVDs themselves. On the second season, I put in disk 2 and it seemed so far ahead of where disk 1 stopped. It took a min, but when I looked at the TV it said 'season 2 disk 4. Even though its clearly marked disk 2 and in that order in the case. I put in disk marked 4 and it says, 'disk 2'. So clearly there was a mix up. Just a heads up to those who may have this confusion as well. So far that's been my only problem.",1425340800,11,567,3.8135593220338984

6444744,4,B00KS47SNU,"FANTASTIC series. I purchased used DVDs. The only disturbing thing about some of the discs was that when inserted in the DVD player, some would rumble for a period of time before eventually quitting. This occurred in the Season 1 discs and Season 4. Made me wonder if it was our DVD player - but no other DVD movies have done this, so I AM inclined to think it was the discs themselves.",1423872000,4,386,4.301369863013699
