8323749,4,B00005LB8G,"One of the things I liked about this film is that it gives a pretty good explanation of early development the P-47 and actually includes some footage of Seversky himself. The film does have some footage that I have not seen in my other titles however as you might assume there is footage used in this film that you will see in many other related films. There is one problem that I have with this film and that is that who ever produced or directed this film actually copied transcript from another film I own and used it for their own naration. I was pretty upset when I was hearing the narrator saying the same script I have in one of my other films. No originalty there! Anyhow It goes over the same MTO ""Medeteranian Theater of Operations"" Operation Strangle footage as seen in many other P-47 films and oh! by the way that is the part they copied. Enjoy!",1170115200,,858,4.36875
