929074,5,6304798466,"This movie is the greatest.  There is so much expression with the cast, you don't even know there are sub titles.  If you have ever taken a dance lesson, you automatically get in to each and every character.  The story  line expresses all of the human emotions, the humor keeps you totally  entertained and the dancing is great.  Plus, it gives you some insight to  the cultural disciplines that the Japanese practice.  I found this movie  very heartwarming and upbeat.  Makes for great conversation afterwards.  I  have seen it three times and highly recommend it. I hope to have in in my  library, once the price comes down.",917827200,7,626,4.685185185185185
929075,5,6304798466,"Excellent does not begin to describe this movie.  ""Shall We Dance"" is a great movie, not because of special effects or big movie stars, but because it is just a simple story that really grabs the  audience.  Simplicity does not imply predictable and cheesy plots, but just  that in a world filled with too many complex storylines, ""Shall We  Dance"" really brings back to basic storytelling.  Not only does the  story pull you in, but the characters are the most original and wonderful I  have seen in a long time.  Even the small characters in this movie play a  huge roles.  Words cannot begin to describe Aoki-san.  If you are tired of  really trivial movies with lame dialouge, bad characters, and cheesy plots,  go rent or buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed",915494400,7,772,4.656716417910448

929208,5,6304798466,"Wow! If you haven't seen the Japanese version,you have no understanding of the struggle for Japanese men to show emotions or do things in public that take so much courage. The English version leaves Sooo much to be desired. There is no shame or humiliation in public dancing here , no reason for this to be remade ,even with hunk Richard Gere. The Japanese characters are true to the movies message. Sooo enjoyable. We have watched it about 6 times over the years. So I finally bought my own copy,after VHS faded.",1473465600,5,513,4.586956521739131
929209,5,6304798466,"A middle aged man resolves a part of his mid-life crisis. I can't say more that this movie is genuine in its portrait of the emotions of a man trapped in a mid-level job and a mid-level life. I would recommend both this original version and the Richard Gere American remake. They tackle the same material but in different ways. The movie is enjoyable but is not trivial. It is what the current word ""authentic"" means.",1471737600,,417,4.5

929286,5,6304798466,"The casting is perfect.  The acting superb.  The writing light-hearted and genuine.  Recalling my own initiation into the world of ballroom dance I can say the story is an accurate account of the experience of many men drawn.  The movie smoothly blends smaller stories around the major and perfectly captures the magic that is dance.

Some movies cannot be improved - this is one - you can skip the American attempt at this same movie - it pales in comparison.",1465084800,,460,4.7

929383,4,6304798466,"A charming movie that truly captures what ballroom dance is about.  I have also seen the American version (starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez) and I feel that this version is much, much better.  As for the subtitles, I found that after a few minutes I forgot that I was even reading them, and experienced the movie as if it were spoken in English.  This is a movie I highly recommend to dancers, and also to non-dancers who might be curious about why people enjoy ballroom dancing.",1459296000,,487,4.574712643678161

929386,5,6304798466,"It has been 20 years since I first viewed this film. I have seen it at least a half dozen times since. It is still one of my favorite movies of all time.

If you love film as an art form and not merely entertainment, you will appreciate that this production fits both categories quite well.

I am haunted by the film's ability to poignantly capture the yearning felt by the main character, someone whom you might see everyday and not take notice. But this story let's us peek into an ordinary life and witness courage, transformation, victory. No huge dramatic ending. At the end he is still an ordinary man, living an ordinary life, with dignity and perhaps joy.

I should let you know that there are some laugh out loud moments as well. You won't easily forget this film or its characters.

(Don't settle for the American version with Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. It wasn't bad, but this Japanese version is something quite special.)",1458345600,,955,4.633136094674557

The Korean release is Region A, meaning you will have no problem playing it in a US player(even works with PS4 or PS3 for playback!).
I'm so thankful that this edition of Shall We Dance is English fan friendly! The subtitles are easy to read and are grammatically correct(not awkward sounding at all!). An extra bonus is that this release is the full edition of the movie, as the US DVD was cut by at least 20 minutes.

It is a romantic story about men working and commenting long distances and wondering if there is more to life than the drudgery. Each day the subway passes a dance studio with a lovely woman standing by the window staring into space, she appears so be lonely and melancholic.  One day it becomes too hard to resist not meeting her and decide to take dance lessons as an excuse to meet her.  But, the challenge and pleasure of dancing captivates them and they stay.  Meanwhile the wives back home get suspicious that the husbands are straying and decide to find out.  The story ends with the marriage saved and the final dance to celebrate the occasion.  A nice fun film to watch on a Saturday night when it is raining and you just want to cuddle up, drink some wine and enjoy the evening.",1423008000,2,1039,4.553763440860215

930122,5,6304798466,"What a surprise! ALL the reviews have missed the central point of this film. In Asia, it is culturally impermissible to show love-affection publicly. It is extremely difficult to ""dance"", thus both husband and wife have a problem expressing this social taboo. This is the central point of the film, all else follows. This attitude plays in China, too (the famous case of Chou en-Lai purposely kissing his wife before flying to the USA for negotiations: Chou en-Lai wanted to appear the loving man with his wife [that he in fact was], to influence the American public). Of course, the USA remake of ""Shall we Dance"" cannot possibly succeed: dancing is not a taboo in the USA, thus as expected, the American remake was a total disaster.",1421107200,,734,4.78740157480315

were inconsequential, since they did not require the men to stay out late drinking with their business contacts. In Japan, that would signal a job in a lower echelon. The dancing contest was lovely and the ending perfect!  Though seemingly imperfect for the protagonist, it turned out to be a beautiful way to bring his wife into the picture.

The opening narration about the apparent conflict between the very reserved cultural interplay between a Japanese husband and wife and the Ballroom Dancing culture is key to understanding what a beautiful thing happens to all the characters in this film. I think, since I have viewed this film on more than one occasion, that the subtitles don't distract from the great physicality of the performances. All the same, seeing this original production, subtitles and all, is much better than the later American remake. The major theme in Shall We Dance is about breaking out of the world which we allow to confine us in order to embrace another unselfishly. That wasn't apparent with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez's film. Plenty of chemistry here in the original. Oh. I neglected to say how delightfully funny this film is.

The movie is more about re-socialization and physical exercise (dancing) as an endorphin enhancing antidote to the insidious depression that we all face at some time in our lives.

It was almost like, we'd like it if was American, with American actors.  They missed the whole point, or certainly one of the major points of the film.

930875,5,6304798466,"Shohei Sugiyama is a married accountant who has acquired a mortgage.  Along with the mortgage, he has also acquired a bit of mid-life crisis.  To alleviate his depression, he starts to take dance lessons, because he often saw a sad looking woman staring out the window of a dance studio, when his train passed at night.  That's where the fun begins!

Only, Mr. Sugiyama is not the funniest one in the movie.  The two men who start dance lessons with him are way funnier. Tokichi Hattori is a short, yacky  man, who always refers to his wife as ""The Missus"".  Masahiro Tanaka is a shy, overweight diabetic told to get more exercise by his doctor.  It is Mr. Tanaka, played by Hiromasa Taguchi, who is the real scene stealer.  Once he starts dancing, it's impossible not to focus on him, even when he's in the background, probably because he often waves his arms around while dancing!  He is hilarious.  He's even more hysterical at the dance contest at the end of the movie, where he and his dance partner are wearing loud matching outfits.

930876,5,6304798466,"One of the most delightful comedies I have seen.  Revealing of women's place in Japanese culture.  It's the daughter who confronts her father and insists that her parents dance together; not allowing them to drift apart from each other.  At the dance studio, a professional ballroom dancer, seemingly old enough to make her own decisions, startlingly reveals that her father refuses to allow her to partner with another man in dance competitions and insists that she work at the studio; and she actually obeys him.  This is obviously, still a male dominated, patriarchal society (despite obvious growth since WWII).  Everyone in the movie grows and learns something about themselves.  Truly heartwarming.",1403654400,,704,5.297297297297297
930877,5,6304798466,"Dancing in Japan, at least at the time this film was made, is something of a rarity, a strange activity, especially for men, who would do their best to not try it, or, god forbid, accept they like it. That's the reason why some people won't do it unless they're pushed by their doctors (exercise), or unless they're no longer themselves, say, assuming the persona of some wild dancer from a foreign land. Trying to fight the societal norms, this is a story of a man having a mid-life crisis who, wanting to bring something new to his successful -nice family, good health (I assume) and a steady income, a typical 'salary man'- but dull life, signs up for dancing lessons. Curious at first, but getting more and more involved, the man discovers that this new hobby of his brings all type of changes to his life, and so that to continue means.. well, you wouldn't want me to tell you the whole story, right?
The movie is better appreciated with some knowledge of Japanese society, of the expectations placed on the common worker and family man as provider, but I guess the humor can be understood by anyone. Leave it to the Japanese to make a charming film about a man and the love of dancing, I can assure you you'll have good laughs with this comedy.",1402185600,2,1250,4.4868421052631575

But it is also a romantic love affair.  No, not the usual boy seeks girl, that would be too common.  The love affair is the approach to dance and how it fills a void, meets a need, and gives a sense of completeness.  This is the perfect video for Valentines day.",1397606400,,567,3.9646017699115044

This Japanese Shall We Dance is in my top favorite movies such as, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, The Way, Inception, 10 Items Or Less, and it shows that simple story driven movies can be interesting to watch.

The main plot path is well worn: middle-age family man (Koji Yakusyo) seeking another turn at bat with an unattainable woman-in-a-dance-studio-window (Tamiyo Kusakari).  By becoming an amateur expert dancer no less!  The script delivers sufficient surprises and subplots to ensure the viewer's full attention.  It also leaves no subplot loose ends, and provides feel-good happy endings all around (more or less).  Directing, acting, camera, and music (not all original) are first rate.  So are the subtitles!

Finally did a couple months ago and you know how some things aren't as great as you remember them? Well this isn't one of those things. This is a very classy movie with the right mix of romance, friendship, humor and heartfelt moments. I refuse to see the Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere version because the sweet tone of the movie seems to be lost in sexuality and Richard Gere's sweeping hair. Although it sort of is a dance movie everyone I've shown this movie to that hasn't been into dance at all (I do love dance) has adored it.

To summarize, Shall We Dance is about a plain businessman that has a crush on an attractive lady he sees in the window of a dance studio everyday on his way home from work on the train. He finally gets the nerve one day to go into the studio and actually signs up for lessons as a ruse to talk to/spend time with her. And from there his plain, boring life is changed forever.

As the opening credits tell you Men dancing Japanese Men dancing is unheard of and a proper Japanese Man would never be caught dead dancing. So when the main character a middle age Japanese Man happily married has his mid-life crisis does he buy a sports car or have a fling with a younger Woman!

931080,5,6304798466,"There is little to add about a perfect Japanese gem like ""Shall We Dance?""; except to say that along the way it manages to comment upon the rat-race (job), false-hopes, disappointment, failure, boredom, self-delusion, and the student/teacher relationship. The supporting cast and the lead actor are middle-aged. The lead businessman, Shohei Sugiyama (played to perfection by Koji Yakusho) is drawn to dance with false hopes and perseveres to achieve more than the attention of Mai, whose face enticed him from the start to the dance studio. His elusive hope,icily pretty and elegant, Mai (Tamiya Kusahari)lead dance-instructress is played with controlled detachment, maintaining a formal and emotional distance long enough to make you feel like the novice dancer, Shohei, waiting to come to life with her personal attention. What this film conveys is much larger than the trite plot summaries in the reviews. The script makes you feel the novice who changes over time, gaining confidence and regard. A subplot with Shohei's wife and daughter about to expose his private passion (dance)as equivalent infidelity only adds to the tension and merges into the denouement. The changes inside the colorful supporting characters unfold as the film moves toward a joyous finish with many other revelations. When you appear to be let down by the longing replaced with reality, the film moves upward still, achieving other delightful 'lessons' beyond the expected romance between the pining novice and his instructress. It cannot be stated enough that only in Japan, such painful personal honesties or effronteries by the actors are handled with careful delicacy and honesty, conveyed with such grace and politeness that makes it impossible to duplicate by other countries. In this gem, you have the dancing excitement of ""Strictly Ballroom,"" coupled with the dreamy longing found in ""Portrait of Jennie"" of the late-40s, holding up the mirror to life.",1375142400,2,1941,5.34640522875817

931222,5,6304798466,"""Shall We Dance"" is a very well described story about attraction between man and woman in the Japanese society. The American version of it is a mockery, dull and void, in spite of Susan Surandon and Richard Gerry. This last, could not capture the same ""feeling"" and became a tortured sequence of scenes. The Japanese movie is about a man that was attracted to the beauty of a girl that he sees while passing through, in the subway, in a dance academy. No lust, no hidden or present intent of messing his own marriage. He only want to become closer, and for that, enrolled as a student. On the other hand, he is a executive, in a very repressed atmosphere of the Japanese Society, and has no time to rehearsals. He can neither do it at home (he enrolled in secret) or in the Company. He is at a cross-road as he didn't conceive the idea of failure before his heavenly teacher.

Something to see and not forget. The American version is rubbish, right to the trash can!

931223,5,6304798466,"So often foreign films acquired for the US consumer were what at one time was called, ""avant garde,"" which often meant weird, with hidden depths, exploratory and thoughtful, however not particularly pleasing or ensemblematic.

Shall We Dance- the Japanese original- has depth in unique character projections that extend beyond that which is customary. Not only do the actors play off the ensemble, intermingling, but from that of themselves. Once having seen the ""Office Walk,"" you won't forget the worker lost in his World, a part of and yet apart from. And then, the night alone practice session on the train platform where the main character who was apart from has become a part of. . . .

Shall We Dance is a well executed ensemble of that which is before and behind the camera. It is representative of international cinema where: Nothing happens--and everything is going on.

931296,5,6304798466,"I decided to watch this on Netflix one night, and it was absolutely wonderful. It's about an everyday salary man named Sugiyama with a wife and child who has lost the joy in his life. While riding home on the Shinkansen (train), he happens to look up and see a woman looking mournfully out of the window of a dance studio. After the second night of seeing her at the window, he decides to go inside and check it out. His first motive to take classes at the dance studio was to meet the pretty dance instructor named Mai he saw standing at the window. But then as he learns to dance more, you can see he has found joy in ballroom dancing, thus bringing joy into his life. You can see the difference in how he rides his bike to work. :) Of course he has to keep this secret from his family. His wife even starts to think he's having an affair.

And the other characters like Toyoko and Aoki-san are hilarious, especially when you see how serious they are about ballroom dancing. You don't have to be a fan of ballroom dancing to enjoy this film. You can see how Sugiyama's earnestness to dance has transformed everyone around him. It has drama, comedy, a great story and great actors; everything you could ask for in a movie. So if you haven't seen it, please do. You're in for a treat. :)",1314835200,2,1287,4.274590163934426

Any of us -- dancers or not -- should be able to relate to the movie themes of longing, hope, and fulfillment; we can relate to feeling trapped, to doing the right things for the wrong reasons (and vice versa), to worrying about how others perceive us, and to overcoming challenges when we finally figure what we've gotta do and why :).

However, the soundtrack of the DVD version has changed from what I remember, and not for the better.  About two-thirds of the way in they play the old Ben E.

It's still a great  movie, especially the wacky supporting characters, but the DVD soundtrack was a bit of a letdown for me.

931552,4,6304798466,"This is one perfectly pleasant and heartwarming piece of cinematic charm. SHALL WE DANCE? gives us a sneak peak into the Japanese taboo, dancing...yes, dancing...and ballroom dancing at that! Maybe in the way Americans may view men who do ballet, the Japanese view ballroom dancing the same...it just isn't manly!.What is more an issue here, though, is how the Japanese view closeness between a man and a woman or between a husband and wife. The relationships are stoic, functional yet distant and cool. Mr. Sugiyama decides that for whatever reason he MUST take up dancing. Whatever the reason that drives him initially is,dancing becomes an obsession and then a love,so much so that his wife hires a private detective to follow his whereabouts. So this lovely story follows Mr. Sugiyama and a cast of very colorful characters into the ""hidden and taboo"" world of ballroom dancing.
The film really explores the dancing and how it opens peoples emotions to their larger humanity. The actors all play their parts in a heartwarming and convincing way, and it is just a downright delightful film. Why four stars? Well let's give it 4 1/2. There are a few draggy spots, but hey, other than that anyone should have a really good time with this film.
 This film needs to be viewed with a Japanese sensibility, and not an American one to fully appreciate the gravitas of this matter.
Excellent companion films would be STRICTLY BALLROOM,MARILYN HOTCHKISS' SCHOOL OF BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM,THE COMPANY,WHITE NIGHTS and BILLY ELLIOT.The Hollywood remake with Richard Gere and JLo is okay, but really lacks the humbleness and warmth of the original.",1185580800,6,1643,5.018315018315018

Yakusho plays the role of flowering hoofer with hilarious awkwardness and genuine joy, while real-life ballerina Kusakari is luscious as the sexy partner who mentors him for a dance competition. Much of the film's humor arrives in the person of Tomio (Naoto Takenaka), Shohei's co-worker by day and an outlandishly attired rumba specialist by night.

931554,4,6304798466,When I first viewed this film it was before they released an American version staring Richard Gere. I had enjoyed this film so much that I could only think that Richard Gere and some others in Hollywood also must have liked it. I had little desire to see a remake of this film since as the film begins the narrator speaks of how dancing is a western concept that makes small allowances for the Japanese private culture. This is the charm of Shall We Dance in that a Japanese businessman is lured into stepping out of his world when watching a dance instructor from his evening home bound train. I was caught up imagining what it would be like to be in his shoes or even some of the other characters such as his wife or one of the other dance instructors. All the characters are colorful especially some whom do not exemplify traditional Japanese behavior. Yes I can not imagine this film being as endearing filmed in the Western version. An interesting look at japanese culture and Western influences upon it.,1183507200,11,1009,4.549450549450549

I had seen ""Shall We Dance"" with Richard Gere & Jennifer Lopez before I saw the Japanese version & felt that it had big shoes to fill.  I wasn't wrong.  Richard Gere's ""Shall We Dance""? is streets ahead with an immensely watchable film.",1182816000,,474,4.3522727272727275
931646,5,6304798466,"At long last, 'Shall We Dance?' is available in the DVD format. I LOVE this film for many reasons. First, you can see what the ordinary Japanese semi-middle class family life is like. No guns or swords, no blood, no samurai or soldiers - this is a very cultural film about modern Japan. Secondly, this movie shows how much the Japanese people admire the European/Western culture (in this film's case the ballroom dancing, sportsmanship, and Blackpool!). If you are, or thinking about, learning Japanese, listen to how Tamako-sensei (the elderly female dance instructor) speaks. As well as speaks gently, she shows the gentle heart of the traditional Japanese lady. Koji Yakusho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/B000EHRVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babel/dp/B000MCH5P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babel</a>) has proved he is one of the most brilliant actors in Japan, and my favourite one is definitely Naoto Takenaka, who plays a funny funny bloke who specialises Latin dance to fill the 'gap' in his everyday life and hopefully find a nice girl too.
FYI: Obviously I have already seen the Hollywood version of this film, but it's not the same thing at all. It's supposed to be a re-make of this Japanese original, but, in my view, it's a little bit too 'westernised' and almost feels like a different film. Maybe you can make your own judgement by watching this original version first? I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",1182556800,6,1567,5.787878787878788
931647,5,6304798466,"<gush> One of my favorite movies. It was remade for American cinema, but really the Japanese version cannot be remade. It is more a movie about Japanese culture than about dancing per se. Taking this film out of the Japanese context loses 95% of what the film is about. If you saw the American version and liked it - or more importantly if you saw the Americanized version and didn't like it - watch the original. (The same advice applies to the Britcom ""Coupling"".)

That said, you must watch this movie. Aoki is wonderful. You'll know what that means after you see the movie. This is a funny, non-violent, endearing movie which includes quite a bit of ballroom dance. The characters are intriguing.

931753,5,6304798466,"This film, released in 1997, and starring director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's regular, Koji Yakusho, in the title role is a wonderfully charming film. Sugiyama, (Koji Yakusho) [one of my favorite actors] is an overworked accountant whose life seems to be very unfulfilling to him. He has a beautiful wife, a charming daughter, and a new home. Moreover, he is well secured in his job. However, while on his commute from work to home he notices a woman on the top floor of a dance studio. He is fascinated at seeing the woman [maybe even sexually]. However, as the film moves along, we see that it is the drudgery of his life which causes him to seek out this dancer, and take dancing lessons.

One of the better roles in the film is by Aoki, (Naoto Takenaka). He gives a fabulous performance as a co-worker who has been secretly going to these dance lessons for years. I thought he was just fabulous in his respective role. There are some very hilarious moments with him and the other dancers in the film. This is not an action film, but a charming comedy-drama about one man who decides that he is willing to take the risk of learning how to dance in a society that does not look at ball-room dancing very favorably: at least in the film. The strong mores of Japanese society keep Aoki, and Sugiyama from letting anyone else know what they are doing every Wednesday night.

However, the wife of Sugiyama begins to suspect that her husband may be having an affair, as she smells perfume on his clothes. Sugiyama has kept this secret from everyone, including his wife. Therefore, his wife hires a private investigator to look into his activities, and what he is doing on these wednesday nights. This is not a film with complex plots, or action, or tense situations [except Sugiyama and Aoki's fears of being exposed], but is is sure one hell of a charming film that is a real treat to watch. I thought everyone in the film was incredible, and a delight to watch. I am not into dance films, or musicals, however, I highly recommend this delightful cinematic treat from Japan to ALL viewers.",1168300800,6,2079,4.586021505376344

931758,5,6304798466,"This movie is another one of my favorite dance films.  In addition to dance, there is a connection with the characters and their personal struggles.  The story has a fortitude and strength in character development and plot that is timeless.  Unlike the US version of the same film, it is not about some middle aged professional well-monied, power monger wanting to go slumming on the sly with a ghetto dance teacher.  This version is about a man who is struggling to find meaning in his life which is filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp.  He supports his family by extended hours and commute times in some sort of accountancy type firm.  He connects to the despair he sees on the face of the woman peering out from the dance studio window, this isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment.  Watching these two characters find and fill the source of this loss through dance is powerful and lends hope to all of us.

Additionally the dance scenes are wonderful.  I especially enjoyed watching the learning process of our main character.  The cast are also top notch, and fill out the roles with a believability and quirkiness that bring us into their lives.  The story is a lovely, tragic, and timeless illustration of the human condition and its trappings most of us struggle with at some time in our lives.",1165190400,4,1351,4.706382978723404
931759,4,6304798466,"While the 2004 remake was lost in translation, Masayuki Suo's original ""Shall We Dance?"" is a stunning visual poem that also serves as the filmmaker's commentary about Japanese society -- with tongue-in-cheek ribbing of U.S. society.  Suo's masterpiece snickers at American vanity and artificiality, especially in the toupee-wearing character.

Actor Kji Yakusho is winning as Shohei Sugiyama, a hardworking man who in yearning to satisfy his emotional void, ends up violating a Japanese taboo.  In his new pastime -- learning to dance in public -- he experiences youth, vitality and joy.  Along with some fancy footwork, he also learns to unleash his feminine principle, and it is that full balance which allows him to reconnect with his wife.

Transplanting Suo's ""Shall We Dance?"" to America is like injecting profanity into a haiku.  The American cinematic imaginaton is as subtle as a migraine, except for films such as the satirical ""Lost In Translation,"" which excelled in its appreciation of Japanese culture and was moody in its existentialism.

So it comes as no surprise that while I admired Jennifer Lopez's dancing and loved the soundtrack, I interpreted the 2004 remake of ""Shall We Dance?"" as a dumbed-down version for the kinds of U.S. citizens who thrive on fat jokes and homophobic humor.  A movie that focuses more on insults makes emotionally and intellectually inferior people feel better about overworking themselves only to find at retirement age that an Enron has robbed them of a financially solvent future.

In the remake of ""Shall We Dance?"" I found the verbal and visual references to Bobby (the plus-size single mom who was taking dance lessons) as a fat cow to be highly offensive.  I also found the running anti-gay jokes equally offensive, and the eventual revelation about Chic (portrayed to the hilt by Bobby Canavale) did not excuse the homophobia in earlier scenes.

No remake of Masayuki Suo's superb film, ""Shall We Dance?"" was necessary.  We Americans would do well to learn from other, much older cultures.  Or, to borrow from Yul Brynner's monarch in ""The King and I"": et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",1151884800,11,2142,5.085714285714285

My only disapointment when I was watching the Japanese ""Shall We Dance?"" was that it had subtitles for you to follow. I hate reading subtitles. You miss half the movie trying to read what the characters are saying. It is annoying.

I wonder why they have not released a dubbed version of this film in English? Or at least give us the option of having a dubbed version on the DVD selections, like many other foreign films on DVD today. I think I would have enjoyed it more had this been the case.",1148428800,3,733,4.503759398496241

It's very similar to Tampopo. After seeing this movie I checked on Amazon, and they do share their main actor (Kji Yakusho) so maybe it's not a coinceidence.

Shall We Dance and Tampopo are both about someone changing their lives by trying to become proficient in a certain area (dancing and noodle cooking), in both cases the main characters are an older man and a younger woman, and both movies are tender Japanese comedies that satirize movie conventions and Japanese culture.

The difference is that in Tampopo, an older man is motivating and training a younger woman, and in Shall We Dance it is the younger woman who motivates and train the older man. Yakusho plays the role of a man stuck in the Japanese work rut, who sees a beautiful pensive woman at the window of a dance school every evening when he passes by on the train. So he decides to enroll to be able to dance with that woman. Along the way, it changes his life, and the way he sees other people, and changes her life as well.

I especially liked the fact that the conflict with his wife was handled with realism and tact, instead of the screaming fits and ""you're sleeping outside tonight"" we've been trained to expect from American television. That was a real relief.

As for which movie is the best, wow ! I can't decide ! Tampopo was a little more substantial, but both are wonderful. I'm going to have to agonize over which movie to nudge off my top 20 to put this one in.",1137628800,9,1618,4.437710437710438
931883,5,6304798466,"Mister Sugiyama has a problem. Everything he strived for in the business world has turned up empty. His life drags on with an almost morbid drudgery. He even ""sold his soul"" to the company to buy the house that he lives in with his wife and daughter (only fairly wealthy people can even think of affording houses in urban Japan). But something still seems missing regardless of his great material success. Then one day he sees the stunningly beautiful Mai Kishikawa from his train. She stares longingly at some point in the distance from a window. Sugiyama's life changes at that moment. Lured by Kishikawa's beauty, he joins the dance school where she teaches. He then enters, for Japanese culture, the forbidden world of dancing. Though he takes a huge risk by doing so, the experience energizes him. But his wife becomes suspicious and hires a private detective to find out where her husband goes at night.

So begins the story of ""Shall we &#12480;&#12531;&#12473;?""; a gorgeous and moving film about opening minds and lives to new possibilities. By the end of the movie most of the main characters have experienced life transformations that expand their horizons irreversibly. Their previous myopic perspectives explode into new visions of how to live meaningfully. And none of these changes take place in isolation. All of the characters learn from each other. The snobbish Mai learns to open up by observing Sugiyama's struggles with dancing. Likewise, Sugiyama gains a new appreciation of his family life through his successes and failures with the dance school. And the hilarious Mr. Aoki sheds his masks and finally finds his true self. Even the private detective hired by Sugiyama's wife starts turning up at dance halls and competitions. Basically, everyone learns not to take life so seriously. The director seems to be asking his Japanese audience to overcome certain shameful aspects of their culture and start enjoying themselves. And, most of all, that one can redeem oneself and grow even after suffering great shame and embarrassment.

The movie is liberating in more than a thematic sense. Beautiful shots of dance halls and Japanese city streets abound. The camera dances with the dancers in many scenes. A lot of thought went into the cinematography and it shows. The film also has a deliberately meditative pacing. No intense action here. This encourages interactive reflection and introspection rather than passive acquiescence. It engages the viewer who decides to engage. And though the focus of the film involves competition, the film ends up not emphasizing the usual ""win win"" aspect of tournaments. This isn't a typical Hollywood movie about rising to the toppermost of the poppermost. It contains complex multi dimensional characters who have real flaws. It's inspiring, funny, tragic, cute, intense, and beautiful all at once.

""Shall we &#12480;&#12531;&#12473;?"" presents a great example of mature Japanese cinema. Anyone who thinks that Japanese films consist merely of flame-throwing robots and underwear obsession will find a huge surprise here. The movie targets adults directly and it deals with its subject matter intelligently and scrupulously.

In addition to the other comments made by other customers with regard to the acting, I add a couple of other observations: (a) When Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) smiles, it lights up the screen. She's acts quite serious throughout the movie, so when she actually does smile, her smile radiates; (b) There's a wonderful scene involving Sugiyama' daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura) to bring her parents closer near the end of the film - very touching.",1130198400,12,722,4.869918699186992

931889,5,6304798466,"I'm sorry to be so critical of the American version of this film, but it lacks so much compared with this one.  There is none of the emotional pain and distress that abounds in this movie.

Sugiyama is a Tokyo work drone who has just bought a house, the ulitimate status symbol, and is now going to have to work for the rest of his life to pay for it, a fact which depresses him.  On his way home from work one night he sees a beautiful woman staring out of the window of a dance studio.  After a few more trips, always looking for her out of the train window, he gets up the courage to get off at the stop and go up to the studio.  In Japan, dancing is akin to one of the seven deadly sins, because even husbands and wives don't touch each other in public and do so with a stranger is more than embarassing. Since ballroom dancing not only involves touching, but being close to, a stranger in public, it is not regarded highly by society in general.

The object of his affection, a beautiful champion ballroom dancer who made the finals at Blackpool, makes it quite clear he shouldn't be dancing just to get close to her, but to his surprise he finds that, even though he started out for that reason, he enjoys the dancing.  His older teacher soon enters him in a dance contest and he makes the final.

As a ballroom dancer myself, I enjoy this film for the highly realistic portrayal of what it is like to learn to dance. I also empathise strongly with the characters, particularly the fat guy dancing to lose weight.  It is not easy to be one of society's outcasts, and all the dancers at the studio verge on outcasts.

If you're quick enough reading subtitles and enjoy a truly great film that manages to be engrossing, subtle, heart-wrenching and yet uplifting, without all the need for Hollywood talk and special effects, then this is the film for you.  I loved it.",1123718400,8,1871,4.332378223495702

Many moments of hilarity, a few sad times, and a bittersweet ending all add up to make this one of the finest films of all time. A splendid cast and a wonderful screenplay. I have seen references to a longer version but I have never encountered such.

Usually crimes like the American version are committed. If the title is ""Shall We Dance"" and the star is Richard Gere, say, ""No thank you.""

""Shall We Dance?"" had already been released in the U.S. The American remake made tens of millions of dollars. Fans of the original had to wait for the remake just to see this DVD. And the remake's being advertized in the DVD's only special feature. So the DVD was made to sell two movies. This release was done for synergistic advertizing, and that's it.

As far as I can tell, a wonderful Japanese story has given its all, so to speak, to fill the coffers of its American rights owners. It's been put in the position of having to advertize another film. And still it can't get released in its proper form, at its proper length.

I would love to have a DVD of this gem, but not this DVD. A crassly-made, hacked-up version of the film and not a single relevant, non-remake-shilling special feature? Why bother buying this? At this point, I practically know all the scenes in the original ""Shall We Dance?"" by heart. Not to mention that the movie has been on cable recently. If it comes on again, my choice seems obvious.

Overall, Director Suo has done a wonderful job re-editing this for an international audience, and I like the opening narration much better than the Japanese one.

I have to admit I did not watch the English version of Shall We Dance? starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez.  Although, I have to say I do not know the Japanese actors as well as I know about the American actors (Richard/Jennifer).  This gives me some what a pre-defined expectation about these American actors.

932078,5,6304798466,"At the beginning of ""Shall We Dansu,"" the 1996 Japanese film Americanized as ""Shall We Dance"" last year, it is explained that in Japan ballroom dancing is regarded with great suspicion.  After all, Japan is a country where couples do not go walking hand in hand or say, ""I love you"" to each other.  Those who flout convention to engage in such activities are certified eccentrics to most of their fellow citizens, but that is not how they see themselves.  Certainly that is not how Shohei Sugiyama (Kji Yakusho) sees himself.

Sugiyama is a forty-something who goes to sit at a desk and work in an office building and then goes home to his wife (Hideko Hara) and daughter (Ayano Nakamura).  As he commutes home the train stops at a station and when he looks up, Sugiyama sees a lovely young woman looking out the window of a dance school.  Every time the train stops at that station, there she is.  So one day he gets off the train and goes up to the dance studio where he signs up for lessons.  At first it looks like Sugiyama has two left feet, but he seems slightly more competent than his two classmates in beginning ballroom, the slightly overweight Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) and the extremely talkative Tokichi Hattori (Yu Tokui).

The problem is that the dancing class ends up not being taught by Mia Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari, a ballerina by occupation), the woman in the window, but rather by the school's director, Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura).  Meanwhile, Mia gives personal lessons to others while Sugiyama can only sneak glances.  We learn that Mai was once a world level competitive dancer, but now she is reduced to these circumstances.  When she senses that she is Sugiyama's goal, Mia politely chastises him.  But by then it has become clear that Mia is a symbol of an ideal, and that Sugiyama is there to dance.

Of course his wife has become equally suspicious and hires a detective to find out what her husband is up to when he keeps coming home late from work.  They are not as aware of how Sugiyama has changed because of his lessons as we are, but they have noticed the differences.  Perhaps the biggest cultural differences this movie reflects from a Western perspective is that when the detectives and Sugiyama's family find out what he is up to, they choose bewildered acceptance over anguish recrimination, although a final confrontation is forthcoming in the wake of the big dance contest.

The biggest difference between ""Shall We Dansu"" and ""Shall We Dance"" is the casting and performance of Kji Yakusho.  The stories are essentially the same to such a degree that it really does make a big difference which of the two you watch first.  But Yakusho is such a figure of quiet dignity that he becomes the eye of the storm that is created around him by the hopes and dreams of his fellow dancers.  Sugiyama is brought into sharp contrast when his character discovers a kindred spirit at work in Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), who can only do the Latin dances he loves when he is wearing a stupid looking wig.  With Sugiyama thoughts and feelings are communicated more by how he stands than anything he says, which explains why his dancing becomes so important to him.

Writer-director Masayuki Suo's film will certainly resonate more with a Japanese audience who can better appreciate what he has to say about the repression of males in that society.  But it is being on the outside looking in that makes us enjoy this film because it does compel us to think across cultural lines.  That is why it makes sense that I am not only comparing ""Shall We Dansu"" with ""Shall We Dance"" in terms of DVDs I watched this week, but also with ""The Grudge"" as well.",1107561600,10,3688,4.655864197530864

I can only add to the many other 5-star ratings that I found this to be a funny and touching movie and that the story, characters, acting, and technical aspects put this movie in the classic category.  Very well done and very enjoyable.

Over the weekend, I checked the film out from my local library. Now that I have seen the film, I can't imagine seeing the US version.

The premise of the film revolves around a sucessful but bored accountant named Shoshei Sugiyama. One night after cocktails with his co-workers, as he is going home on the train, he looks out the window and notices a pretty, young Japanese woman (Mei Kishikawa) gazing out of a window from a ballroom dance studio. For a couple of nights, he sees her but then he decides to go see about taking dance lessons from her. Shoshei ends up being in a class of beginner ballroom dancers with an eccentric dance instructor. Over the course of the film, Shoshei grows to enjoy ballroom dancing as well as enjoying life itself again.

I enjoyed this cute comedy a lot. The supporting cast was hilarious like the lecherous Tomio Aoki who has a preference for young, pretty dancers for his dance partners. The female dance instructors were pretty funny, namely Toyoko Takahashi who is a big drama queen. The choreography was amazing. The actors and actresses did a splendid job of pulling off the dance moves including the times they had to collide into other dancers. I don't know why the US had to make their own version of this endearing Japanese comedy. I have not seen that version nor will I ever. Nothing will copmare to ""Shall We Dansu?"".

It's both dramatic and light-hearted and addresses the international problems of mid-life crisis and broken dreams.

One day as he rides the subway back home, his eye is fixed on a lovely dancer Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari). This leads him to take up ballroom dancing just to meet her -- there he meets up with other interesting characters who take up dancing. Soon Mr. Sugiyama finds great fulfillment and friendship as he participates in the ballroom dancing competition along with his fellow dancers. Not only that, but Mr. Sugiyama finds that his personal and family life, the lives of the other dancers, his instructors and all concerned are transformed for the better as a result. (I don't want to give away anymore! You have to watch it for yourself.)

Even though I'm definitely not a dancer, this movie made me want to dance.  The viewer can fully identify with Mr. Sugiyama, who feels as though he has 2 left feet. (Also, ballroom dancing may not be a manly activity to get involved in.) The actor who steals the show in this movie is the one who plays Mr. Aoki (Naoto Takenaka) -- a ostracized colleague of Mr. Sugiyama who tries to get girls to dance with him through pretending to be the great Latin dancer Donnie Burns.  Aoki's exaggerated facial expressions and body movements are hilarious!  Tamiyo Kusakari does a great job of playing the lovely dancer Mai whose life is also transformed as she instructs these men and turns them from clumsy beginners to accomplished dancers.

I loved this story because it deals with the theme of redemption and transformation.  It also talks about the interdependency of our lives upon one another and how we can effect positive change upon each other.  It talks about the importance of trusting one another and reconciling relationships.  All these important themes are captured in a heartwarming and hilarious comedy. It is rare to find a movie these days that will make you smile and feel good about life after you watch it. This is one of them.  It is such a great movie! Shall We Dance?  Most Definitely!!

932084,5,6304798466,"Dancing has always been a form of rebellion.  From the unseemly closeness of the Waltz to the banned gyrations of Elvis the Pelvis to modern day Freak Dancing, the freedom of expression and sexuality that accompanies dancing has shocked and shamed across the centuries, making heroes of those daring enough to challenge the rhythm of the music.  Heroes like Shohei Sugiyama.

In the prescribed world of the Japanese salaryman, a pattern of life is expected.  ""The nail that sticks up gets hammered down"" is a familiar Japanese expression.  Middle-aged Shohei Sugiyama has always filled the role expected of him, going to work, doing his job and burying the passion of his soul into a deep and secret chamber.  One day, glimpsed in a window, he discovers something that revives the long-forgotten feelings and brings up that need for freedom and expression that he sought to stifle forever.  Fiery and sexy, dance instructor Mai Kishikawa ignites not only his passion for her, but Shohei's passion for life.  As he comes to say, ""At my age, it's embarrassing to say so, but every day I feel so alive. ""

A comedy, Masayuki Suo's ""Shall we Dance?"" is peppered with wacky elements and crazy juxtapositions that one would expect of this situation.  Tomio Aoki,  played by Naoto Takenaka (""Ping Pong,"" ""Waterboys,"") possibly my favorite modern Japanese actor, is an ill-fitting mentor to the blossoming Shohei.  A co-worker at the same office, on the weekends Tomio transforms into the flamboyant and be-wigged Donny Burns, Latin world champion.  Only the monotonous and repressed world of the Japanese salaryman could produce such a character, as those who have lived with the freedom of expression all their lives would feel no need to rebel in such a manner.

There is a lightness and grace to ""Shall we Dance?"" that is a-typical of a Japanese film, and it is no wonder that it has been so successful abroad.  Masayuki Suo is a fantastic director, and I would love the success of ""Shall we Dance?"" to open the door to American releases of some of his other films, including the Sumo comedy ""Sumo do, Sumo don't.""

I have never seen the American re-make, so I can offer no comparisons other than to say that Masayuki Suo's ""Shall we Dance?"" is not just a great Japanese movie, but a great movie period.",1105920000,10,2299,4.826530612244898

As much as I enjoyed Gere, Sarandon and Lopez in the American version of this film, this Japanese original has more soul, I think, and more interesting messages. In the American film, a key message seems to be about married couples understanding and being witness to each other's lives, while in the Japanese version a key message is about daring to love ballroom dance for its own sake -- in a culture that frowns on ballroom romanticism. And another message in the Japanese story is about dance partners needing to trust each other as they perform their roles: ""The man protects the woman."" This film pulls you into really caring about the simple, middle-aged accountant who dares to become a real ballroom dancer, and the traditional wife who tries to figure out and accommodate the changes in her husband. A great film to have on hand because you will want to watch it again. POSTSCRIPT: I just watched this film again -- the full 136-minute version in Japanese with no dubbing or subtitles. I don't speak Japanese. AND I STILL LOVED IT. Every single minute. I'd forgotten how touching the husband-wife relationship is and how much the lead actor, Koji Yakusho, reminds me of Gregory Peck.

Yes, the American version is entertaining enough, but the Japanese version is everything a story on film should be, making you really care about the characters.

This Japanese film inspired the recent American remake with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez.  That film has its own charms, but this story really works better in its original context.  The overworked, suffocating salaryman living his life of quiet desperation is a familiar figure to the Japanese, whose preoccupation with respectability and conformity can weigh heavily on those seeking professional acceptance and success.  As his initial attraction to the woman transfers to a genuine love for dance, Yakusho shows us a man who blossoms before our eyes as his renewed confidence and sense of joy begins to improve every aspect of his life, including family and work.

932157,5,6304798466,"Masayuki Suo won over audiences across the world with ""Shall We Dance?"", a sweet crowd-pleasing dance flick. Despite its serious look at Japanese culture, it's a charming and funny story about a man struggling to inject some sparkle into an unfulfilling life, and the dance that helps him do it.

Shohei Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) is a successful businessman, with a lovely house, loving wife, and a lovely teen daughter. But though he has everything a person could want, he is unhappy and doesn't even know why. But one day on the way home, he sees a beautiful woman (Tamiyo Kusakari) looking sadly out of a dance studio. He sees her there every day, and eventually he hops out of the train and signs up for dancing lessons.

Since ballroom dancing is frowned on in Japan, Sugiyama keeps his lessons a secret, and it's a bit of a struggle for him to overcome his natural stiffness. Because of his odd hours and the perfume on his shirts, his wife is afraid that he's having an affair, and hires a detective to follow him. But after Mai rejects him, Sugiyama begins to have a love affair -- with ballroom dancing itself.

There's something very sweet and pure about ""Shall We Dance?"", which you hardly ever see in movies. Not just because of the lack of naughty material in it, but because the story itself has a sweet joy just ingrained into the dancing, the dialogue, and the way Sugiyama drags himself from the doldrums.

In Japan, ballroom dancing is considered kind of embarrassing and seductive, which gives Sugiyama's passion for the dance a ""forbidden fruit"" quality. But the film doesn't lapse into cliche territory. Sugiyama's affection for the beautiful Mai is based in something more than attraction, since he senses that she is as sad as he is. Their growing relationship is a beautiful thing to watch.

But don't think that it's all dancing and depression. Masayuki Suo gives the film some comic flair with a systems analyst who clearly has fantasies about being a wild-dancing Latin lover. But the director never descends to slapstick or hijinks, preferring to stick to the warm'n'fuzzy brand of comedy. The scripting is solid, with plenty of quotable gems like ""Dance is more than the steps. Feel the music and dance for sheer joy."" That could have been the tagline for this film.

Koji Yakusyo is entirely lovable as Sugiyama -- you can actually see this everyman getting happier as he gets more and more into his dancing lessons. Ballerina Tamiyo Kusakari plays Mai with sensitivity and depth, managing to convey a wealth of emotion in small gestures. The supporting characters, like the graceless Tanaka and the hysterical Aoki aren't as well fleshed out, but they are lovable.

""Shall We Dance?"" is a unique little movie about joie de vivre. It's not a truly great film, but it is a wonderful one that will leave you with a smile on your face.",1097798400,43,2860,4.754032258064516

932159,5,6304798466,"This movie left us with such good feelings.  It was well written, flowed gracefully. Great dialogue, dancing and laughter.

I have seen the new version with Richard Gere. While it is a good movie, it's not this movie.  Some of the dialogue they used was directly from the original and did not flow quite the same way. (i.e., the detective telling his assistant why the rude couple was disqualified "" Its a british sport, after all"" sounded forced and did not quite fit.  All in all the original version gets my vote for the better movie.",1096848000,11,537,4.5625
932160,5,6304798466,"I see over one hundred well-written summaries on these pages, with an average five-star rating.  While adding my rave review to the list, I ask the question:  Why tamper with perfection?  The US-made re-make is about to hit the screens with A-list cast Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon.  I know for a fact that a large majority of the U.S. population will never watch a subtitled film, so I can understand the reason for re-making it.  However, I think everyone who has written here will agree that there's no way this Gere/Lopez/Sarandon re-make will capture the spirit of the original, certainly not the two driving forces that propel it.

First, there's the drudgery of the Japanese salaryman...like millions of others Tokyo-based wage slaves, Koji Yakusho's unhappy accountant takes his hours-long train ride home each evening, beaten down a bit more by his lot in life.  He spies a dance studio, a dancer...and slowly - night after night - develops a small dream.  The night he finally decides to get off the train is a magnificent scene...there's a complete struggle going on inside his body to hop off and stay off that train.  I wonder how the re-make will possibly capture even a smidgen of that angst.

Second, there are the strong mores of Japanese society and the overrriding ethos of ""the upright nail gets hammered down.""  In the U.S., to a large extent, the spirit of the individual endures - if you want to dance, you dance.  In Japan, not only is Koji Yakusho's character battling himself, he's battling his country's perception of his decision to dance, which basically can be summarized as:  ""Guys don't.""  Again, I challenge the re-make to capture this tension.

I will point out that I'm not dead set against any re-make:  I'm a big fan of the Argentinian film ""Nueve Reinas,"" and thought that 2929 Entertainment's recently released ""Criminal"" really compared quite well to the original.  Still, I urge those of you with any interest in seeing the upcoming release of ""Shall We Dance"" to do yourself a favor and invest 118 minutes in the original, a great look at Japanese society.",1095379200,297,2118,4.855153203342619
932161,5,6304798466,"""Shall we dance"" starts with a regular middle aged Japanese salary man returning home from work.  When his co-workers ask him to spend the night out on the town, he declines.  He rides the late train home in a comatose state, like countless other salarymen.  With regards to his accounting job, he says, ""I neither like it, nor dislike it; It's my job.""  This is the state the hero, Mr. Sugiyama, starts in - a state of neither like nor dislike, of neither being alive nor dead.  Comatose.

But on the ride home, he catches a glimpse of a melancholy, yet beautiful lady staring out the window of a dance studio.  He's intruiged by this woman in a strangely platonic way.  His fascination isn't sexual, afterall, he is married and has a daugther.  Perhaps he feels as though this woman shares his loneliness, or maybe he sees her as a potential savior.  Eitherway, the movie leaves these questions to the audience.

Eventually, it leads to ballroom dancing, and very soon Mr. Sugiyama is taking lessons.  He, along with his misfit group of classmates, start from the bottom and work their way up, and through ballroom dance, Mr. Sugiyama revitalizes his life.

This movie is about dancing, but it's about so much more.  It is a film that could only work in Japan, where things like dancing, along with other public displays of affection, are considered taboo.  The characters in this film, from the taciturn Mr. Sugiyama, to his co-worker who walks in straight lines, find freedom in dance.  The movie is a romance, but Mr. Sugiyama's affair is not with the beautiful lady in the window, but with the dance that has helped him find meaning in life.

This film is pure joy.  Nearly every scene and every sequence leaps with energy.  The characters are loveable and we empathize with them, even if they are rude and overly sensitive at times - it makes them human.  As Mr. Sugiyama continues his lessons, we see an added spring to his step, a consistent grin on his face.  We can't help but smile too.

Eventually, the film leads to some sort of competition, like most dancing films do.  But by then, we don't care who wins or who loses; that isn't the point.  As we are watching Mr. Sugiyama dance, right down to the last sequence, we realize that the point is recognizing the graceful movements of Mr. Sugiyama compared to the rigidity that plauged him when he started.  His dancing is an extension of his life, and as Mr. Sugiyama breaks free from his rigid lifestyle, we break free with him.",1094428800,17,2492,4.609090909090909

It's good social satire and heartwarming without being dopy. The acting is sensational, and it is often sidesplittingly funny. ""Shall We Dance"" offers informative satirical insights into modern Japanese culture such as self-conscious shyness, subjugation of the individual to workaholic values, and inflexible gender roles, through a clever screenplay marvelously directed and performed. The script and plot are tight and it is almost impossible to stand outside the story. While the westerner with no experience in Japan will find the movie enjoyable, the depth of the social satire and irony will appeal to anyone who has even a superficial understanding of modern Japanese culture.

932255,5,6304798466,"This is a  clever late 90's Japanese film with English subtitles about ballroom dance lessons. No, this isn't your Arthur Murray dance studio.  The subtitles are very easy to read and clearly defined.  The cast is a memorable diverse, intriguing, group of characters taking dance lessons.

Since the Japanese are reserved about public intimacy, dance lessons are of a clandestine nature. The consensus here is that men are considered losers if they take dance lessons or lessons are just a reason to hold a woman in your arms.

The story focus is on Mr. Shugiyama, an overworked middle-aged man with a wife, daughter at home.  From his commute, he spots a beautiful woman in a window as she teaches her students dance steps.

His intention is to meet the girl, but she blatantly tells him that she takes this serious and if he is there just to meet her, then he should not take lessons.  She adamantly informs him that this is a classroom, not a disco. To ""save face"", he hangs in there and learns to dance rather than become a failure.

The array of characters:
A balding, quirky, Mr. Aoki, has been dancing for five years, he wears a long frizzy wig piled loosely on his head because he believes the wig gives him inspiration to be like his idol, Donny Burns, a Latin dance king. While he dances, he gives these funny facial movements that equate with his suave, cool, bawdy dance numbers. He comes across like a combination Don Juan and Madonna striking a pose! He is known to dance ""creepy.""

An extremely shy and reserved heavy-set man with thick glasses gets his fulfillment learning to dance. He becomes alive once he learns the steps.

Also, an abrasive dance instructor who isn't afraid to spew her insults when needed and she trades verbal jabs with the male customers.
As the movie reaches the climax, a number of dance halls and amateur dance contests are held.

An unusual treat is the Drifter's song ""Save the Last Dance For Me."" It is the only English lyrical song, quite fitting for the occasion. This movie is a gem, full of humor and silliness. See it!......Rizzo",1088294400,7,2081,4.655737704918033

There are lots of elements from Kyogen (a kind of comedy from the Edo Era) and Manzai (comic dialogues played by a pair of stand-up comedians) in this film. Poking fun at each other's physical characteristics (an old bag, a short ass, baldness, etc) is a strong feature of the former.  Naoto Takenaka's bizzar sytle of dancing reminds me of Hideki Saijo, a Japanese pop singer who was quite popular back in the late 70s.

And the acting is wonderful; the consummate players disappear into their roles.
That this film is Japanese portends great things for the post-Kurosawa age.

But even with that dark cloud hovering, I found this movie delightful and good. I think the way (Yakusho) was sent back to his family--his wife--was touching and I did cry when they danced under the moonlight at the urging of their daughter. I cried a couple of times in this movie.

932350,4,6304798466,"I've had two people recommend this film to me when I told them I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's Strictly Ballroom.  This is a Japanese film that tells the story of a businessman named Mr. Sugiyama and how he fell in love with ballroom dancing.  Mr. Sugiyama is married and has a daughter.  Everyday on his way back home from work, he admires a woman from the subway at the stop in front of the Kishikawa dance school.  One day, he gets up the nerve to drop by the school and asks about lessons.  At first, he wants to see how far he can take this crush with Mai (the woman he's been admiring), but is quickly set straight when she tells him she doesn't date students.  She also hopes that Mr. Sugiyama took up dancing because he truly wanted to dance and not as an excuse to ask her out.
What I like about this film is that it doesn't take any short cuts in the story telling.  You don't see Mr. Sugiyama as a beginner in one scene and a world-class competitor the next.  You see him struggle and develop his love for dance slowly.  He really sweats it out.  (However, this virtue becomes a vice as the film sometimes seems to drag.)  There are no delusions of grandeur on Mr. Sugiyama's part.  He doesn't wish to compete in an international competition (such as the one Mai lost in some time ago).  He just loves to dance.  It is entirely believable that Mr. Sugiyama's commitment to dance rekindled the flame/love Mai had for competing.  Mai appears to be a bored snob when we first see her looking longingly out the dance studio window.  By the end though, she looks like a hopeful, first-time competitor ready to take on the world.
An implicit theme throughout this whole film is the Japanese culture.  We learn that ballroom dancing is something that most people are ashamed to be associated with (as are any public displays of affection).  We learn that families are formed out of practical reasons and not out of passion or love.  (I suppose Mr. Sugiyama's character in the film embodies the typical Japanese -- polite, courteous, and, sadly, repressed.)  There are many other interesting and humorous characters in the film as well.  We have an eccentric  office worker who dons a wig and turns into Donny Burns world-champion Latin dancer at night.  A chubby middle-aged man that sweats profusely but picks up dance steps quicker than Mr. Sugiyama.  A squirrelly man that has some dance experience before but decides to help and hang out at the dance studio.  An emotional woman who holds two jobs and finds time to practice for competition.  A discerning private detective that understands Mr. Sugiyama's affair with dancing.  Mr. Sugiyama's teenage daughter that thinks her father has gone mad.  Truly colorful characters.
Had I not been set up to compare this film with Strictly Ballroom, I might've enjoyed Shall We Dance more.  One note about the music in this film.  It just isn't as inspiring and as integral as it is in Strictly Ballroom.  Sure, it's ballroom dancing with classical music.  But it has no passion.  In Strictly Ballroom, when they were dancing the Paso Doble you could associate the music with the love between the dance partners.  In Shall We Dance, you almost have to ignore the music to appreciate the story.
This is a very character-driven story.  Nonetheless, it's a good film for the family.  Watch it!

932442,5,6304798466,"No sex, no violence, nothing suggestive...good clean family movie.  The story can touch people of all ages because it addresses: boredom in a stable marriage, a suspicious spouse, a teenager embarrassed of her parent, people with ""two left feet"" who try to learn how to dance, the difference between good teachers and bad teachers, fear of failure, unrequited love (or the secret admirer), family enstrangement, persistence, how one of your office co-workers could be leading a double life, how to handle public embarrassment, and friends who come from unexpected places.  The story is well organized, and even if you don't read the subtitles you would have an idea of what's going on.  My favorite parts are watching the students go from slowly learning the basic steps, all the way to the beautiful moves and costumes of the competition dances.  Shows an interesting perspective of office life in Japan, and also brings the universality of ballroom dancing to all cultures.  Quite a few moments of light comic relief in the form of one particular quiet co-worker who afterhours imagines himself as a legendary champion dancer. The film shows that it's never too late to try dancing lessons. Great introduction if the thought of dancing ever crossed you mind.  Maybe, you'll take that first step; with this movie at least you understand what to expect if you ever go to a dance studio. Have courage...after watching this movie, you'll KNOW that you could definitely do better than some of the dance students in this charming movie!",991785600,36,1532,5.011811023622047

This is the place wherin I was given an opportunity to communicate.  I am forever grateful for that.

Needless to say,I don't completely agree with the policies of this very powerful country.  Can you folks give me any insight as to what may be happening in the way of steering this wonderful planet to a society wherin people have enough to be what they might want to be, and to be able to express that particular being to people who might find value in that expression.

However, one typical evening, on the way home from work via the train, he glimpses a lovely, melancholy dancer gazing into the night sky from her father's studio.

932559,4,6304798466,"Let me give you a little of stereotyping on the Japanese company man.  They go to work, they are bored for the whole day, accomplish a few tasks,  work late to appease their boss, once in a while go out and drink with the  co-workers (if 2~3 times a week means sometimes) and go home and hopefully  catch their kids still awake if they're lucky.  Repeat same tasks  tommorrow.
No wonder they wear strictly starched collars and seem like  robots to most people.  They all look the same, dress the same and act the  same.  It is the Group mentality that permeates this.
Shohei Sugiyama is  in the same boat, but he wants more out of life than to spend his life  working for the company and filling out his spare time with the mundane  homelife.  So one day, on the subway, he spots a beautiful dancer and all  the emotions he locked away in his soul begins flowing out.  Soon, he joins  and secretly takes lessons to see the dancer every day.
However, the  dancer, Mai, has no interest in him.  While dance has opened up Shohei to  life and art, it has made Mai hard.  She is a professional dancer, under  the rigors of competition, politics and time ticking away.  She is the cold  person that Shohei has shed.
In an American movie, Shohei and Mai would  have eventually learned that they loved each other and hooked up (like  Strictly Ballroom and The Cutting Edge), but in Shall we Dance, the  relationship becomes more genuine.  Shohei teaches Mai to become a person  again, not to take competitive dancing so seriously and Mai shows Shohei  that work, material possessions are not everything.  They need each other,  and later on, Shohei realizes that it not on a sexual level.
The other  characters are very good as well.  Tanaka plays an overweight beginner who  was forced to dance as exercise for his diabetes.  He is first painfully  shy but by the end, dance brings him out of his shell.  The other is Aoki,  the wig wearing Latino dancer wannabee.  He is deeper than we all first  make him out to be (as comic relief).  Dance is his life and he sees no  meaning beyond it.  It crushes him when he is embarrassed by a fellow  dancer and cannot show his face in the studio anymore.  The final  interesting character is his wife, who has accepted her domicility, only to  have it crashing down on her when her husband begins doing things without  her knowing about it.
Shall We Dance? is less about dancing and more  about what impact dance can have on peoples lives.  This is a movie that  focuses on the characters and puts interesting ballroom dance competitions  as a backdrop. It is a film full of life, but not of life easily found.  Try Shall we Dance?  I think you will be greatly rewarded by the time the  final credits roll around....Rating: B+",966384000,14,2761,4.477732793522267

But one evening on the train home he sees a beautiful woman looking out the window of a dance  studio, so he signs up for dance lessons for the worst (best?) of reasons -  to see a pretty girl. The film is less about his fairly innocent  infatuation with this woman than about his growing love for dance and how  it transforms his life. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.",963446400,7,498,4.5
932561,5,6304798466,"Light, full of humor, fun, and shares a subtle longing to fill the empty moments of life (both in the movie and for the viewer).  Not a movie about dancing so much as a tender look at the outside of our sometimes box-like  existence.  And it is clear that it has touched that tender spot in the  lives of many who have watched it--this movie sparked a revival in Japan of  ballroom dancing.  For me, it sparked a renewed appreciation of excellent  films.  Recommended for all viewers.
Now... where is the DVD!  The honest  reason I'm writing this review is to beg for the DVD release.  I want to  preserve as much of the magic of the silver screen as possible and it would  be great if there could be extras too... I'm sure all would agree on that.",961804800,6,748,4.294964028776978

While riding the train, he spots a beautiful woman through a window working in a ballroom dance school.  He decides to sign up  for dance lessons and his life begins to take some interesting twists and  turns.  A well portayed satire on the life of a Japanese salaryman and on  the consequences of trying to express ones individuality in Japanese  society.  The movie is down to earth yet surrealistic, emotional and  heartwarming.  The genius of this movie is the way that dance was treated  as a metaphor for love. The other aspect of this movie was very clever was  the way that the Japanese group dynamic was explored.  At the beginning of  the film, the hero balances his work and homelife; but as the movie  progresses, the addition of another peer group causes friction between  these groups that is both comedic and tragic.
I felt that the presence of  the detective detracted a bit from the overall storyline, but otherwise,  the movie was thouroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.
