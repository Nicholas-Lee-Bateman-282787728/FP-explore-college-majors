8140731,5,B000HOJR7Q,"The kids and I discovered Koala Brothers on clearance at a Ross Store.  They love it!!  I quickly hopped on Amazon and bought all of the other Koala Brother's available.  It is very sweet, yet entertaining.  The characters are always ""here to help"", and they truly care about their friends.  Teaches good life lessons!  Appropriate for any age (mine are 3 and 5).",1234051200,,363,4.682539682539683

8140733,4,B000HOJR7Q,"""The Koala Brothers"" are back in a full-length special that finds them celebrating the holidays in their own unique way. Holidays just aren't the same without having your friends there and this year, a very special friend named Penny the penguin has hurt her wing. She's written to tell the Koala Brothers that she won't be able to make it up to the Outback for Christmas. The Koala Brothers are quite upset. At first, they reluctantly accept the news, but eventually hatch a plan to fly all the way to the South Pole!

Now, all of their friends in the Outback must pull together to make sure everything is ready for Christmas. As Frank and Buster make their journey, Ned and Mitzi are put in charge. They have to decorating, get everything cleaned up, get things organized and more. It's a big job and Mitzi seems to want to do most of it herself, but Ned eventually discovers a way to help.

The Koala Brothers have Australian charm, kindness and teach great lessons. This is a holiday special that all ""Koala Brothers"" fans will love and anyone can enjoy. The DVD comes with two games --- Dress Up Frank and Buster's Activity Cards. It also has trailers for other Lion's Gate releases, such as ""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends: The Prince, the Princess and the Bee"" (wonderful!), other ""Koala Brothers"" DVD releases and more.

This isn't a magical Christmas special or anything, but it doesn't have to be. The Koala Brothers are what they are and I wouldn't have them any other way.",1169078400,3,1487,4.64638783269962
8140734,3,B000HOJR7Q,This is cute but should be for a young group. Under the age of 10. Not the Christmas movie I thought it would be.,1168387200,,113,3.75
8140735,4,B000HOJR7Q,It is very good Christmas movie for anyone to watch Christmas movies.  I collect several Christmas movies.,1168300800,,106,5.235294117647059
8140736,4,B000HOJR7Q,"I gave this title four stars because, as enjoyable for the kids as it is, it simply does not do Christmas like Rudolf, Frosty, and Charlie Brown.  For instance, there is absolutely no mention of the origins or meaning of Christmas, as there is in Charlie Brown's Christmas special. Moreover, as the classic status of Rudolph and Frosty demonstrates, young children love the idea of Santa Claus.  In Outback Christmas, though, Santa is entirely absent.  The christmasy elements are merely bolted on to a fairly stock KB plot.  This could have just as easily been an Easter or Halloween special.

Now, on to the high points.

True to the series, a problem presents itself and Frank and Buster set about solving it while helping others.  Here, Penny the penguin can't make her own way to the Homestead for Christmas because she has hurt her wing.  Buster can't bear the thought of a Christmas without her. As always, though, the Koala Brothers are ""here to help"".

At Buster's urging, a reluctant Frank agrees to fly with Buster to Anarctica to bring Penny to the outback for Christmas. Meanwhile, with Frank and Buster gone, it is left to Mitsy, Ned, and all the rest to ready the homestead for the big holiday.  That means Mitsy bosses Ned around while the others pitch in where they can.

Not surprisingly, the stop-motion animation is smooth and seamless.  We get to see lots of Frank and Buster flying; complete with a few white knuckle moments.  It's fun to see how the series' creators portray a Christmas in the arid outback.  There are plenty of lights, a big tree, and an inflatable snowman.

The snowy scenes of Antarctica are a nice diversion.  Penny's home turns out to look more like a ski lodge than a place where a penguin would live.  For my money, though, the outback scenes are more appealing.

A couple of minor quibbles:  First, there is no opening segment where the brothers fly around looking for someone to help.  Second, the ""Helping Song"" is absent.  My kids love those portions of the regular series.  Leaving those elements out was a disappointment to them.",1162857600,,2082,4.725
