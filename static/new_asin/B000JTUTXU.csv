8152949,3,B000JTUTXU,"This may indeed be a bootleg because even though the DVD includes a menu with links to subtitles, there are none, not even in Spanish!  The back of the case says there are other features as well, but there are none.  I bought the movie because I enjoyed the novel in English so much.  I gave it 3 stars because it looks like a very thoughtful and well-acted movie.",1400025600,3,364,4.246376811594203
