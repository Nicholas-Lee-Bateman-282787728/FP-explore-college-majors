8435605,5,B004M7MJHE,"I have seen this film during the short time when it was for free to watch at the official webside. It's kind of depressing to see what we have done, that we need places like Onkalo. It's definitely worth watching it. I'd not say, that I loved the movie (like the stars mean), but it's well done and very  informative.",1343606400,6,317,4.283333333333333
