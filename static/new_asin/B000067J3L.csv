1719301,1,B000067J3L,"The Human Body is a good theme, but this one is ""no-so-good"" approach (very rare, because NGS make very good videos). The better documentary I ever seen about it, is the Dr. Winston's The Human Body, from BBC. Only available from Amazon.com.uk (please American Amazon's friends, what do you are waiting). I recommend to wait.....believe in me !.",1036195200,10,345,4.9655172413793105
1719302,3,B000067J3L,I thought this DVD slightly below an average National Geographic video once there is more personal dramas than scienfic information. However I was moved by the story of a teacher with a brain tumor and his family anxiety.,1034208000,14,221,4.842105263157895

7963557,5,B000067J3L,"I am an instructor of psychology at a small college, and this video contains several segments that perfectly illustrate some of the concepts covered in my General Psychology class.  The brain surgery segment generated wonder in my students, while the stem cell segment was a great source of questions and discussion on ethics.  In addition the segment on the research on the London cab drivers and The Knowledge class was a great illustration of how research is conducted and how the hippocampus functions. Thank you for bringing the world into my classroom.",1389571200,2,558,5.054347826086956
7963558,5,B000067J3L,Outstanding pictures of infants developing in the womb. Received in good condition and good time. Recommend  this for anyone interested in how infant is developed,1379894400,,162,5.48
7963559,5,B000067J3L,I used this in school science class to interest students in a study of the human body... worked great ... quality and speedy shipping was fantastic,1270166400,,147,4.6923076923076925
7963560,5,B000067J3L,"I purchased this DVD for my graduate class.  They found it very enjoyable (I noticed they leaned forward as it played).  We focused on the infertile couple, as this was related to the course content.  Watching them we felt as if we were in the room with them - throughout their nail-biting experience.  My only objection was having to skip around throughout the DVD to complete their story - as each person's medical issue was ""sprinkled in"" throughout the DVD.  The picture was clear and the narration struck a good balance between science and enthusiasm for the work the people did.  I'd highly recommend the DVD to any age group from high school on up.",1184198400,,655,4.6521739130434785
7963561,5,B000067J3L,"This was well documented, informative, amazing, and I would recommend getting off of the fence and pulling the trigger, if you are already moving forward, rest easy, you made a wise decision.  Very enjoyable.",1146614400,4,208,5.117647058823529
7963562,4,B000067J3L,"The current ""spotlight review"" on this site complains that this video doesn't cover a wide range.  Well, why don't you direct the next one and include everything that we know about the human body, all in one hour.  Just how much of a range do you want to cover in 55 minutes.  It's a silly complaint.

We actually get to see open brain surgery being done on a conscious patient.  That's not the kind of thing I see every day.  I have only done three or four brain surgeries on conscious patients.  How about you?

We get to see a couple trying to have a baby, going for in vitro fertilization, and we see what that actually means.  We see the little sperm cells moving around in the microscope slide.

We see the smile on the lady's face when she finds out that she is pregnant with twins.  We find out why multiple births are so common with this procedure - because they implant multiple fertilized eggs into the woman in hopes that at least one of them will result in pregnancy.  I didn't know that.  And she gets to decide how many, the choices generally being 2 or 3 apparently.

We see the wife of the man who is undergoing brain surgery, and we live the experience with her as well as her husband.  We even meet their kids, the little girl who was told she may have to teach her daddy to read.  She seemed very proud that she could help.

Somebody is criticizing this video?  What an ingrate.  Pearls before ingrates.  Some other connoisseur on this site has judged that he has seen superior films, and therefore this one deserves nothing but criticism.  What are you, nuts?  Get over yourself.",1137715200,22,1600,4.389078498293515
7963563,3,B000067J3L,"This movie could have been more informative had it gone deep into more details than the Examples. This video discusses some different cases of different individuals like a Woman in need of conception 14 years after her marriage, a teacher suffering from a brain tumor and a basket ball player. The subject is mainly highlighted through these cases and thus this movie does not cover a very wide range of human body and mind and infact is restricted to some cases only. Not for the People who want to know more and more about the human body and brain.",1111795200,14,550,4.565656565656566
