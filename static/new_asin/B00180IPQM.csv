3176383,4,B00180IPQM,"(Spoilers ahead)  I was just so overjoyed that someone spent some time to make a film based on ""the Beau"" that was not some cinematic concoction!

The film gives the major elements of Beau Brummell's life:  his vanity and cockiness, his influence on the Prince Regent (played by Hugh Bonneville, now known for his role in ""Downton Abbey"" as the amiable Earl of Grantham) and on men's fashion, credited with getting men out of knee breeches in into trousers.  We see him preen and see the pursuit of the bailiffs who come to take payment of his extravagances.  We see how his familiarity with the Prince Regent has a limit, and his wit finally oversteps its boundaries, leading to his social demise.  The film infers that Brummell was also a lover of Lord Byron as well as courtesan Julia Johnstone, in a brief menage a trois.

What we don't see is the sad end of this man, his dying in a charity house of tertiary syphilis.  There was not too much displaying his well-known caustic wit that would no doubt render the film character unlikeable.  There is not even a hint at the real end of the man.  The audience is robbed of a conclusion.  Maybe the director's vision was a feel-good movie, as upbeat as the catchy film soundtrack.  Those not familiar with Brummell's life presume he skipped off to Paris to escape his debts and lived in obscurity.  The truth is much less candy-coated.

James Purefoy makes an admirable Beau, far too confident for his own good. The costuming is well-done and the scene of the Beau's toilette for the Prince and his cronies is hilarious.

I highly suggest reading the engaging and thorough biography written by actor Ian Kelly, ""Beau Brummell:  The Ultimate Man of Style,"" on which the film is loosely based.  It is well researched and makes no sweeping, unfounded assumptions about the life of Beau Brummell.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Kelly had a minor role in this film as one of the Beau's ""body dandiacal.""",1305244800,18,1954,4.630813953488372
3176384,4,B00180IPQM,"""Beau Brummell: This Charming Man"" is a brief, romantic look into the life of the man who finally changed the ridiculous attire that had been a tradition for many years of wearing a powdered wig, make up and stockings to a new form of appearance, later known as the ""Dandy"". This consisted of a ruffled shirt, overcoat, trousers, high boots and top hat and cane in the traditional ""Dickensian"" manner to which we as audiences are accustomed to gaze upon.
There is something about this film and I believe that it is the lively musical score, which fits the film perfectly and encourages a certain ""pace"" about it.
His influence over George IV to accept the ""Dandy"" look as the new ""manly"" form of gentlemen's dress essentially turned the tide of fashion history. Although Brummell himself is an extremely flawed and immoral character, we tend to accept his faults.
What is unbelievable but true is that people used to pay to watch him dress in the morning, which could take several hours, in order to understand the nature of the fashion revolution that was upon them.
Recommended as a very different departure from the usual. There is a funny ""confrontation"" scene where two ""FOPS"" meet Brummell and his Servant dressed as ""Dandys"". They mutually insult each otherand break out into ""fisticuffs"" but the ""Dandy"" wins easily due to the greater mobility in their new threads! Lead actor Purefoy is a pleasure to watch!",1300406400,5,1416,4.8312757201646095
3176385,4,B00180IPQM,"Quite entertaining story of how dandyism came to be.  Beau Brummel changed men's fashion from the foppish style of wearing wigs, makeup, and overdecorated clothes to the more sedate, manly style that we love in Regency movies.  The story is not that deep but it does have some moral lessons like the price of extravagance and valuing loyalty and friendship.  James Purefoy is  perfect for the role Beau Brummel. What became of Beau Brummel was quite common during his time when men were addicted to gambling and excessive spending.  He quit England to escape debtor's prison but at least he left a legacy of tasteful fashion that still evident today.",1297814400,4,650,4.872727272727273

How snitty amazon can be! Period dramas are my favorite type of movie. James Purefoy (Rome,Vanity Fair, Mayor of Casterbridge, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Mansfield Park)is one of my favorite actors, so this movie was destined to be a favorite! Historically it is of great value. Just think, if it weren't for Beau Brummel, our men might still wear ruffles. The most excellent supporting cast includes Hugh Bonneville(also of Mansfield Park)and Matthew Rhys. My only complaint is that this movie is too short. I am sure this story deserves more than it's length of only 79 minutes and someone should be ""horse whipped"" or at least ashamed of the stunted state of this production.

3176395,4,B00180IPQM,"Sadly, I think this is very much the worst parts of The Beau's life. Having read many stories surrounding Beau Brummell, some fictitious and some based on fact or factual, my favorite parts of this film are the costumes, and Beau's dressing scenes. The real Beau should have wished to look so good - even though shirts at the time went over the head, these scenes are beautiful and give you a sense of who Beau was to himself. This is a really hard time to portray as there is so much licentiousness going on in a society completely self absorbed in itself - the upper ten thousand of England's aristocracy. He was much more and much better than portrayed here, but I would not pass up the opportunity to see this film. By the way, the portrayal of the Regent was excellent-possibly it could have been even more developed though the story is not about him. Beau Brummell was an unfortunate recipient of STD - his promiscuity lead to his death in an asylum in France completely mad. George Byron figures higher than he should in this film, and his perversions, and although many would know his name as a poet, Beau Brummell still shapes the way men dress today.

3176400,5,B00180IPQM,"The best portrayal of the Beau Brummell set of Movies I've found. I love the Regency Era... I would never want to live then, even were I a Queen because it was an awful time for anyone not very rich and well connected and of ""rank."" The class structure was brutal and unforgiving and what little ""social consciousness"" existed was nowhere near enough to help the many lower classes. To be a woman - well, pray you were not unless you had a powerful father who adored and protected you (not many of those about.)

This movie follows the historical record of the Prince of Wales (Prinny, and he was a whale of a man!) and his capricious relationship (friendship) with a man who had ""Society's eye"" for a while... before they did what they always do and turned against him. A style setter that changed forever the way men clothes themselves.. a major change and ethic in Britain that still exists today... this was its genesis. The men still dress this way. The sets and scenery are worth viewing, pause the movie! ...

3176409,2,B00180IPQM,"I knew Beau Brummell had a place in fashion history, but that was all. Sadly, I didn't learn much else from this film. I really enjoy Purefoy's acting, but he can only work with what he's given. Unfortunately, that's not a lot in this case. The story is thin. He's a silly, irresponsible dandy who overspends, gambles, and doesn't pay his debts. He has the prince's favor only to lose it due to disrespect. He gets what he deserves and I don't care that he's broke, abandoned and unhappy. It doesn't even show the impact that Brummell had on fashion, so why did I watch this again?",1362873600,,581,4.4392523364485985
3176410,1,B00180IPQM,"I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made.  Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?

I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick), but I do about Byron.  To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling.  Scrope Davis, Byron's life-long friend, was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal, if even that.  Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero, there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots, one of which was fashioned for a lame leg.  Simply put, if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film, no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had, it would have been out of fright!), nor would they have scrambled across continents to ""unphilosophize"" him.  Unlike the actual Byron who was, according to one of his innumerable lovers, famously judged ""mad, bad and dangerous to know"" - Rhys is, well, just ""bad."" And NOT in a ""good"" way!  It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.

But apart from Byron, if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel, about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree.  And apart from the Spartan script, there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking.  The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed.  I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all (""the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace"") it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates.  And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress, I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.

In short, I wasted money on this one,  money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table.",1356393600,11,2439,4.613425925925926
3176411,4,B00180IPQM,"As I write, this movie is available on Amazon Streaming, free for Prime Members. I enjoy period dramas and also like historical tidbits. After viewing the movie, which is very well done although it does, as some reviewers infer, concentrate on Brummel's personal failings as well as his fall from royal grace, I cannot help but wonder at the insinuation that the friendship with Lord Byron truly did Brummel in. James Purefoy seemed extremely well suited to the role of Brummel and brought a lot of character not just to Brummel's seductive nature but his weakness as well. My one problem is with the actor chosen for Lord Byron. Lord Byron was far more handsome, more dazzling, more magnetic than the actor who portrays him here, alas. The result is that the viewer tends to tense up, wishing Brummel not fall for a person who is clearly not played well. The message is not effective due to the casting mistake. On the other hand, the butler/cook/better half to Brummel is nobly rendered by Philip Davis, a marvelous actor. Hugh Bonneville is of course a most adept player.",1353542400,4,1074,4.748663101604278

In another book, Ian Kelly has portrayed the life of that iconic chef Antonin Careme, the father of haute cuisine, with great care and feeling for his subject, going to the extreme lengths of perfecting many of the original recipes in his own home. 'Cooking for Kings: The life of Antonin Careme, the first celebrity chef' is, quite simply, a delicious read.",1345248000,,580,4.586538461538462
3176413,1,B00180IPQM,"I wanted to know more about how Beau Brummell influenced fashion and hygiene.  The movie hardly covered these important aspects.  It focused more on Brummell's debts and gambling. I wanted to know how people reacted when he walked into a ballroom or drawing room when he did not wear high heels, a powdered face, or wig.  I wanted to know how people reacted to his darker colors and simpler masculine, less-effeminate style.  How long did it take to change men's fashion?  Brummell made a courageous statement in fashion, and yet there was no grandiose cinematic show of it.  There was one scene where gentlemen came to watch him dress, but there was little explanation as to why they would waste their time.  Wigs and perfume were all used to mask the lack of bathing, and yet there was no significant statement of the change Brummell enacted.  How did he convince men to bathe more often and how did he influence the importance of personal hygiene for both men and women?  There was more to be told of the story and the movie failed.",1325203200,2,1035,4.612021857923497

It's not fluffy but a very interesting, even compelling movie that can explain where the Queen came from... and other Brits who all jealously guard their ""rank.""",1434931200,,1177,4.578199052132701

3410905,4,B00180IPQM,"I enjoyed this movie.  The acting and costumes were well done, and the locations were beautiful... The story was just a bit slow in the telling.  However, if you're a fan of James Purefoy, you'll like this film.  He does a great job!",1365724800,,233,4.372093023255814
3410906,2,B00180IPQM,"I knew Beau Brummell had a place in fashion history, but that was all. Sadly, I didn't learn much else from this film. I really enjoy Purefoy's acting, but he can only work with what he's given. Unfortunately, that's not a lot in this case. The story is thin. He's a silly, irresponsible dandy who overspends, gambles, and doesn't pay his debts. He has the prince's favor only to lose it due to disrespect. He gets what he deserves and I don't care that he's broke, abandoned and unhappy. It doesn't even show the impact that Brummell had on fashion, so why did I watch this again?",1362873600,,581,4.4392523364485985
3410907,1,B00180IPQM,"I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made.  Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?

I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick), but I do about Byron.  To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling.  Scrope Davis, Byron's life-long friend, was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal, if even that.  Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero, there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots, one of which was fashioned for a lame leg.  Simply put, if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film, no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had, it would have been out of fright!), nor would they have scrambled across continents to ""unphilosophize"" him.  Unlike the actual Byron who was, according to one of his innumerable lovers, famously judged ""mad, bad and dangerous to know"" - Rhys is, well, just ""bad."" And NOT in a ""good"" way!  It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.

But apart from Byron, if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel, about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree.  And apart from the Spartan script, there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking.  The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed.  I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all (""the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace"") it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates.  And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress, I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.

In short, I wasted money on this one,  money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table.",1356393600,11,2439,4.613425925925926
3410908,4,B00180IPQM,"As I write, this movie is available on Amazon Streaming, free for Prime Members. I enjoy period dramas and also like historical tidbits. After viewing the movie, which is very well done although it does, as some reviewers infer, concentrate on Brummel's personal failings as well as his fall from royal grace, I cannot help but wonder at the insinuation that the friendship with Lord Byron truly did Brummel in. James Purefoy seemed extremely well suited to the role of Brummel and brought a lot of character not just to Brummel's seductive nature but his weakness as well. My one problem is with the actor chosen for Lord Byron. Lord Byron was far more handsome, more dazzling, more magnetic than the actor who portrays him here, alas. The result is that the viewer tends to tense up, wishing Brummel not fall for a person who is clearly not played well. The message is not effective due to the casting mistake. On the other hand, the butler/cook/better half to Brummel is nobly rendered by Philip Davis, a marvelous actor. Hugh Bonneville is of course a most adept player.",1353542400,4,1074,4.748663101604278
3410909,5,B00180IPQM,"A superb period drama from the book written by the excellent Ian Kelly. This film throws new light onto an age of elegance and decadence, and the rags to riches to rags story of one of the great characters of the Regency. In another book, Ian Kelly has portrayed the life of that iconic chef Antonin Careme, the father of haute cuisine, with great care and feeling for his subject, going to the extreme lengths of perfecting many of the original recipes in his own home. 'Cooking for Kings: The life of Antonin Careme, the first celebrity chef' is, quite simply, a delicious read.",1345248000,,580,4.586538461538462
3410910,1,B00180IPQM,"I wanted to know more about how Beau Brummell influenced fashion and hygiene.  The movie hardly covered these important aspects.  It focused more on Brummell's debts and gambling. I wanted to know how people reacted when he walked into a ballroom or drawing room when he did not wear high heels, a powdered face, or wig.  I wanted to know how people reacted to his darker colors and simpler masculine, less-effeminate style.  How long did it take to change men's fashion?  Brummell made a courageous statement in fashion, and yet there was no grandiose cinematic show of it.  There was one scene where gentlemen came to watch him dress, but there was little explanation as to why they would waste their time.  Wigs and perfume were all used to mask the lack of bathing, and yet there was no significant statement of the change Brummell enacted.  How did he convince men to bathe more often and how did he influence the importance of personal hygiene for both men and women?  There was more to be told of the story and the movie failed.",1325203200,2,1035,4.612021857923497

8268014,2,B00180IPQM,Silly. The portrayal of Lord Byron is just awful! Brummel may have been known for his style but to act as if Lord Byron is practically unknown is ridiculous.
