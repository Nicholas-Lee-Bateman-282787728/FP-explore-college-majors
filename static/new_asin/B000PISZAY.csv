8252967,1,B000PISZAY,"This video is not a good Christmas video.  Though the Santa looks like Santa, he doesn't come across as natural and appears too fake.  He does have the white hair and beard like Santa, but that's about it.  His voice is so-so, definatley nothing to get excited about.  Since the video only costs a dollar or so, you may want to give it a shot.  But you could probably find something better at a discount store for the same amount of money, especially if you want your holiday to be joyous!",1252454400,2,489,4.329670329670329
