5023945,5,B006WDE95G,"`Grand Coulee Dam' is a 90 minute DVD. It has English subtitles, and scene selectors, no extras. It tells the story of the Columbia River and how the Grand Coulee Dam came to be built. The problems of irrigation and hydroelectric power in the region are discussed with some of the too many talking heads that are used throughout the film. The construction of the dam is show with period films.
The promises that were made to the residents, especially the Indian tribes who had their sacred ground and burial grounds and fishing livelihood destroyed are emphasized. The Indians never did get the cheap electricity they were promised and it took 50 years for a financial settlement to be made.  The abundance of fish and especially the salmon industry was all but destroyed.

Coverage is given on both the pros and cons of the dam. What is especially emphasized in the pro side is that without the dam and its hydroelectric power much of the manufacturing for WWII would not have been accomplished. The dam is credited with shortening and helping to win the war. The postwar world of industry is covered as well as the attempt to recover the salmon fishing.
Woody Guthrie's songs and information on the documentary film he was hired to do are included.

The dam is summed up as the price of progress, the ecological damage is well documented and the film does lean more to this side, including the devastation to the native Indians' lifestyle.
The narrator is a bit nasal at times and the prevalent talking heads can be an irritation, but this is still an interesting and educational DVD for those interested in the Columbia River area and the time period from the depression until now and the effects of dams on the environment.",1343692800,,1727,4.711920529801325

8505584,5,B006WDE95G,"The Columbia River runs 1200 miles and begins in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It meanders south through Washington state and then west between the borders of Washington and Oregon to the Pacific Ocean. The idea of a dam was first promulgated in 1918 to channel or siphon off water into an adjacent reservoir. The water would be used to irrigate more than a million acres of land. Eastern Washington is semi-desert. The city of Moses Lake in central Washington receives eight to ten inches of rainfall a year. The Cascade Mountains to the west act as a barrier preventing moisture from the Pacific Ocean getting to the central region. The idea of a dam languished until the Great Depression when the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. President Roosevelt, to stimulate the economy, appropriated $3.3 billion on new infrastructure projects. FDR approved the dam and reservoir that was estimated to cost $181 million. On July 16, 1933, its construction began. The dam was engineered with 12 penstocks or tubes that funnel water at high velocity to spin turbines, generating electricity. Power is produced when gravity accelerates water down a 500 foot intake pipe (penstock). The 12 turbines' blades spin at high velocity as water passes. Turbines are connected by a shaft to a generator - a giant wheel with magnets (rotor) spin inside a rim of copper wires (stator). As magnets spin, they generate electricity in the copper wires that are sent out to power lines. The Grand Coulee Dam has a total capacity of 6.8 GW with an average annual energy output of 2.3 GW. As a comparison, Hoover Dam has a total capacity of 2.0 GW. The final cost was nearly $163 million, and March 22, 1941, marked its completion with a formal dedication. When WWII broke out, the Grand Coulee Dam became one of the best investments Uncle Sam ever made, a strategic godsend for the war effort, quite an amazing coincidence in American history. It takes enormous quantities of electricity to produce aluminum. Power from the Grand Coulee Dam helped the Boeing Airplane Company in Seattle churn out a third of the planes used in WWII. In Portland, the power was used to manufacture 750 ships. The reservoir provided irrigation for more than 500,000 acres of new farmland for a total of a million acres. Today, it generates enough clean energy to supply two cities the size of Seattle. However, there were disastrous consequences. The Colville Indian tribe were dislocated. In Kettle Falls, the native Indians lived off the annual salmon runs of more than 300,000 fish. The $300 million salmon industry was destroyed as the fish runs were made extinct, lost forever.",1467331200,,2661,4.928730512249444

8505587,5,B006WDE95G,"The flourishing civilizations of the Egyptians and the Romans realized the necessity of usable water to sustain human life and it's basic needs. One of the intended benefits and features of this dam's construction was not unlike the ancient aqueducts of Rome. And some parts of the Columbia River flow through a desert area some what like the River Nile. Another more simple human need, jobs for the unemployed, finally brought the earlier dreams of a dam on the Columbia River near to the Grand Coulee to reality. And who could have foreseen that the electricity generated by the dam would have such a critical need to the World War II war effort. Production of aluminum requires vast amounts of electricity and the aircraft of the War required vast amounts of aluminum. The original leading purpose of the dam had been to provide electricity and irrigation to a huge desert like area of Washington State that could, with water, grow almost anything. It was many years after the completion of construction of the largest dam on the planet and the largest man made object at the time before it's irrigation capabilities and benefits were realized. But, it's construction had already been validated by the contribution of electricity to produce aircraft, ships and the important development of nuclear capabilities that ultimately brought the War to a close. And sadly the other side of this construction effort was the lose of fish habitat and irreparable damage to the lands of the Native Americans and their livelihood. Such massive construction projects of man have both good and bad consequences. This DVD provides insight.",1427846400,,1627,5.029629629629629

8505589,5,B006WDE95G,"Leave it to the republicans to do anything in name of jobs regardless of its impact on the environment just like they did not want to pass the plastic bag ban in SoCal since they claimed it would cut few jobs but yet the damage to the environment was justified... OR leave it to the liberals on the west coast to demand that water and power is a right not a luxury that they have to pay for by ruining the environment since they want the water and power but never ever want to address the consequences of getting or producing utilities. After all, liberals are the same group that encourage electric car when infact sixty percent of the power is generated through coal but yet they want to shut down every power plant regardless of coal to nuclear plants as long as it is not in their backyard. When the cats leave, mouses play; Leave it to the human specie to justify their destruction in name of progress.

P.S. The size of those salmons are truly shocking in comparison to today's salmon runs. Shame.",1419811200,,1003,4.421621621621622
8505590,4,B006WDE95G,"This is a solid documentary on the Grand Coulee dam, covering the motivations for its construction, the process involved in moving it from concept to completed structure, and its positive and negative effects for communities, the nation, and the environment.  I would have liked more information about the planning, design, and construction of the dam, but I'm an engineer, whereas this documentary was surely intended for a general audience.

In my opinion, a central and general lesson from this documentary is that any human project involving such scale and complexity will have both intended and unintended effects, manifesting across time frames ranging from immediate to very long term, both positive and negative, and affecting various stakeholders differently.  So whether such a project can be called a 'success' will largely depend on who you ask, and possibly also when you ask.",1386288000,,889,5.335714285714285

8505592,5,B006WDE95G,"What a wonderful DVD.  If you are interested in Native American things this has a side that is most interesting.  You see for yourself the befores and afters.  But what caught me the most was the moving picture of the people fishing prior to the dam.  That fishing area is gone and will never come back.  It changed the peoples lives.  They did not get what they were promised.  It was a cost for Native Peoples to better the community.  The local community never did get better, they were the cost cause it all went to the bigger cities.  Very interesting history.  Sometimes we don't see the bigger picture.",1358035200,,609,4.504587155963303
