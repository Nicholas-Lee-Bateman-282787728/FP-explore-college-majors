8314683,3,B001KC4YMW,"I don't know about you, but it is one thing when your on the floor training and letting the practice unfold and its another thing having to sit a watch a video that is not a move all the way through when just like practice the video is should be digested in small bites. So Chapters would have helped in viewing this dvd.",1367798400,,321,4.111111111111111
8314684,5,B001KC4YMW,Thanks for sharing the seminar for those students who could not be there. Anno Sensei is true treasure.  Thanks to all those who make his visits possible.,1297468800,,154,4.703703703703703
8314685,3,B001KC4YMW,"perhaps we forget that aikido is a martial art and uke works too hard to allow nage to do the technique, especially if nage is a famous shihan and direct student of o sensei.
this pretense and unrealistic approach is what leads many to decry aikido.
nice video but much better ones are available.  this one has too many old, out of shape shihans and the techniques are too unrealistic.

8314686,5,B001KC4YMW,"AIKIDO NO KOKORO is truly inspiring.  The elegant techniques and heartfelt instruction of Motomichi Anno Sensei, 8th dan,  leads one to a clearer understanding of the message of the founder, Morihei Ueshiba Osensei.  Also shown, are the powerful yet delightful  techniques of Mary Heiney Sensei, Jack Wada Sensei, and Linda Holiday Sensei.

This as a very high quality production which I plan to watch many more times.

8314687,4,B001KC4YMW,"I found this DVD to be very helpful, both as a student and as a teacher of Aikido. The demonstrations are well shot and clearly presented.  Senior instructors featured in the DVD include  Motomichi Anno 8th Dan, head of the Kumano Juku Dojo in Shingu Japan, and Robert Nadeau, 7th Dan, head of City Aikido of San Francisco, plus many other teachers from the Bay Area and the West Coast. On-camera commentary about the meaning and purpose of Aikido adds depth and context. Well worth the price!",1227484800,5,493,4.655172413793103
8314688,5,B001KC4YMW,"""This DVD has helped me understand how the principles of Aikido - e.g. harmony, connection, centeredness, oneness with the universe - give birth to the techniques we use on the mat, and it has helped me to articulate this relationship to my students.  There is a lot of wonderful footage of Anno Sensei.  I was very moved by his heartfelt encouragement to the participants to carry on the art.  His humility is clear and contagious, and I feel that showing the DVD to my students has reinforced the loving community spirit of my dojo.  In addition to Anno Sensei, the DVD includes some other teachers who studied closely with O'Sensei, as well as teachers from the next generation from a wide range of dojos. It was especially inspiring to witness the contributions of so many women in the art, as well as to see how some very dedicated young people are preparing to carry the art forward into the future.""
