475504,5,6302498996,"While western cinema has been gifted with wonderfull epics such as ""The Godfather"" and recent epics such as the ""Lord of the Rings"", often foreign films, though usually just as wonderfull, seem to come in singles.  It's very rare to find a trilogy of epic proportions outside of the United States, but if there was ever a series of movies by any Mexican directory that can most definately be classified as an Epic, it's the trilogy of ""Pepe el Toro"" (Pepe the Bull).
Starring the late, great, Mexican actor/musician and songwriter, Pedro Infante, this trilogy tells the tale of a young Mexican boxer that went from rags to ritches and back to rags.  This is not your typical cookie-cutter, rags to ritches and back story however, moreso, this is a sublime Shakesperean tragedy that reflects the apogee of Mexican cinema.
""Nosotros los Pobres"", ""Ustedes los Ricos"", and ""Pepe el Toro"", is one of the finest trilogy of movies ever filmed, and no one, who considers themself a movie buff, should miss it.  In true epic fashion, this movie will send you on a rollercoaster of emotions.  It will bring you to tears and fill you full of joy, and make you profoundly think about those things in life we take for granted.  It has romance, comedy, action, and drama, plenty of gripping, heart pounding drama.
Don't miss this gem.",1078444800,12,1320,4.746724890829694
475505,5,6302498996,"I must say i just recently became a Pedro Infante fan, especially after seeing this movie. This is one of the best mexican movies I have ever seen and one of Pedro's best films. Pedro was a tremendous actor and I could see why he was and is so loved. I loved the sequels to it also. a real tearjerker. Pedro Infante still #1...",1070928000,3,327,4.125
475506,5,6302498996,"Writer/Director Ismael Rodriguez makes this dedication at the start of this 1948 classic film: ""A todas estas gentes sencillas y buenas, cuyo unico pecado es el haber nacido pobres...va mi esfuerzo"", and he gives us a story about people caught in the grip of poverty, when their luck goes from bad to worse.
Beautifully photographed in sepia tones in what looks like a soundstage, it stars the wonderful Pedro Infante, and his exquisite interpretation of ""Amorcito Corazon"" is one of the film's highlights.
A face that will be familiar to U.S. audiences is a young and attractive Katy Jurado, in one of the supporting roles as ""La que se levanta tarde"".
The plot consists of one calamity after another, but it has humor as well. The two tipsy women, La Tostada and La Guayaba,  are hilarious, and it has many light moments and musical numbers.
Though the film might have weaknesses, it has charm and tenderness, and it makes a tremendous impact...it's not a film you're going to forget.
Its parting words, written on the back of a truck, are ""se sufre... pero se aprende !"" (""one suffers, but one learns !""). The story is about suffering, but it's also about courage and love.
Another Rodriguez/Infante film not to be missed is ""Los Tres Garcias"", which is a comic masterpiece, and one of my very favorite films.",1020038400,17,1312,4.779735682819383
475507,5,6302498996,"Ms all del enorme talento de Pedro Infante como cantante, esta pelcula --que al lado de ""Ustedes los Ricos"" y ""Pepe el Toro"" forma una extraordinaria triloga de la pobreza y la nobleza-- es una muestra de su asombrosa calidad interpretativa en tanto actor. He visto al menos dos personas (que no entendan ni una palabra en Espaol), llorar como Magdalenas al ver a Pedro Infante sortear desgracia tras desgracia en las tres cintas; a mi me conmueven varias escenas a pesar de que las conozco de memoria. Quienes la han visto, las volvern a ver y no se aburrirn; las nuevas generaciones descubrirn a uno de los ms grandes actores populares de Mxico y, les aseguro, no se decepcionarn.
Definitivamente, hay que tenerlas: cinco estrellas, facil.",1016496000,7,741,4.84251968503937

475510,5,6302498996,"The critics of the mexican cinema always forget the great contribution that director Ismael Rodriguez has made to movies. This film has a great human touch, focusing on a small number of people and their aily problems.

475570,4,6302498996,"Nosotros Los Pobres(1947, We The Poor)is a classic from director Ismael Rodriguez. Pepe El Toro(Pedro Infante)is framed for murder and thrown in jail! Pepe's ""daughter"" Chachita(Evita Munoz)and his paralytic mother have to try and survive without him. NLP is corny and soap opera-ish at times, but it's engaging, filled with colorful characters, and it has some heart and soul. I am amazed at how Rodriguez got some gruesome violence past the censors(Don Pilar brutally attacks Pepe's defenseless mother, a man gets stabbed in the eye, etc). The first time I saw Evita Munoz, she played a greedy, obese, fat woman in a funny, side-splitting India Maria movie from the 1980's. In NLP, she looked so cute and adorable as a child. She also did a good job in a demanding role. The late Blanca Estela Pavon looked so lovely and angelic in this film as Celia, Pepe's love interest. The film also does a nice job treating its female characters as human beings. Nosotros Los Pobres is followed by Ustedes Los Ricos(1948) and Pepe El Toro(1953).",1215907200,,1036,4.892045454545454
