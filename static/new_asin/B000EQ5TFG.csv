2529686,5,B000EQ5TFG,"We liked the DVD as it was action packed and full of spills, tosses, stomps, and bulls kicking some butt!

The DVD is broken into segments. The music is matched well to the action. the last segment is a Q&A to the riders and one of the Bull Fighters.

I personally cheer for the bulls; I don't want to see anyone get seriously hurt, naturally. But it is fun to watch the Bull or Bronc toss a tough cowboy to the ground and watch him run and scurry away. I did a lot of cheering watching this DVD.

There is no blood or gore. A few guys get beat up a bit as can be expected, but it is safe for the ages, unless you don't think riding bulls is appropriate for some, then, I suppose you would not be reading this review would you?

Overall I give it thumbs up!

I would recommend this DVD. I think it would be a nice gift to give to someone difficult to shop for...as long as the have at least a bit of an interest in the sport.",1196208000,14,925,3.9516129032258065

8113275,5,B000EQ5TFG,"I am just starting to get into bull riding . I have been watching and going to events these past 3 years . I gotta tell ya-- I sure do wish I was young again ! (don't we all,right)? I am 47 yrs of age and I have a very bad back . It was soo bad that I am now on disability retirement . Just years and years of damaging and adding to the already injury that occurred while serving in the military in the late 80's / early 90's . ---- But anyway----- If I could go back in time , I would love to try to ride these beasts . Try it anyways . Just once and see how it goes . I've seen them up close at the rodeos and I think they can smell my fear . (that's good though-- you have to respect that bull). -- So what I am trying to say--- I already have a terrible back injury . I wish I got that from riding these bulls !! --- I don't know how these guys do it !?!? Its not whether or not they are going to get hurt during a ride--- but more like how bad they are going to get hurt during that ride . God Bless 'em ALL !!",1388793600,3,1015,3.5972850678733033
8113276,5,B000EQ5TFG,I love bull riding. It is my favorite sport and this dvd is packed with excitement. I like the fact that they added interviews with some cowboys.,1373241600,,145,4.407407407407407
