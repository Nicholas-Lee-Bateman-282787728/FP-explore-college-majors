8180631,5,B000NQGPBY,"I was in the cast of this play with fellow nurses (and even a doc or two). I will never forget the tragedy of losing our precious friends. I was supposed to have been in that car and my then young son, Nathan, begged me to stay home.
  After the tragedy, we cancelled all plays and went on the perform the next year in honor of our castmates. They forever remain in our hearts. The CD hs many emotional songs and ones which many nurses and docs will relate.
