7894259,5,6305701717,Wow!  I saw this at another person's house and decided I HAD TO HAVE IT.  The dancers are extremely talented.  What a gift.,1318636800,,123,4.260869565217392
7894260,4,6305701717,"If you like dance, you'll enjoy ""Explosive Dance"".  Filmed at the Royal Albert Hall as a Red Cross benefit, this medley of dance styles has something for just about everyone; ballet, modern, jive, salsa, Irish step dance, even flamenco.  The main gripe I have is that there are no subtitles to tell me exactly what the heck I'm watching.  Some of it I recognize: pas de deuxs from ""Sleeping Beauty"" and a weakly orchestrated ""Don Quixote"", and the unmistakable thunder of ""Riverdance"" (the performance opens with the delightful ""Trading Taps"" and closes with the energetic finale).  However, the notes on the package only identify the performing company, not the individual dancers or the piece they are performing.  Also, the camera has a disconcerting tendency to show close-ups of the dancers when we'd really rather see their feet.  Still, this is a good one to have in your dance library, if only for its variety.",1035244800,11,918,4.928571428571429
7894261,3,6305701717,"As for a fault about this video which I point out, the dance being printed  on the package is that it isn't being recorded in this video. It is a  thunder-storm in the Riverdance. Some sets of teams in the video played a  wonderful dance. I was almost satisfied. And, this sentence is being  translated by the translation software. Forgive me for the poor sentence  from Japan.",965520000,9,377,4.567164179104478
