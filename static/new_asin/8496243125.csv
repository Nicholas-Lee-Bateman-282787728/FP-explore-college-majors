8324636,3,8496243125,"This video is produced by Pasoalto, in Barcelona, Spain. The case I received says ""The Fifth Word"" but the main title screen of the DVD says ""La Quinta Palabra."" This was originally a Spanish-language cartoon that has been dubbed in English and repackaged with an English title.  This presents a minor detraction from the overall experience because the voices don't match the animated lips of the characters.

Additionally, the animation is pretty basic. At times it looks like a high-school project rather than a professional production. Again, this bothered me more than it bothered my students.

The biggest issue is the complicated narration. Scenes cut between Mother Teresa's experiences in Calcutta and her childhood in Albania rapidly, sometimes every few seconds. It can be confusing for very small children, but older children may be able to track the story.

The DVD also contains a ""making-of"" documentary in both English and Spanish.

Overal: This isn't exactly what I expected, but I'm not disappointed.",1310947200,7,1017,5.253086419753086
