8435355,5,B004LYWFW2,"I first saw this movie on YouTube under the title Kamikaze 1945, and I was absorbed by it from the beginning. I've been an avid WWII enthusiast since my teens and I've read plenty of books on the subject to know that what you see depicted in most Hollywood movies is just that, Hollywood. This movie shows the REAL kamikaze pilots as they truly were, ordinary guys, no different than our own, thrown into circumstances beyond their control. As a rule kamikaze pilots have usually been depicted as insane and eager to throw away their lives for their ideology and the warriors Bushido code (which I'm sure some did for this very reason), but this movie shows a very seldom seen side to that notion. Guys that want to be with their families, with their loves, or to just....live. Sadly, because of their culture and traditions they are shamed and made to feel guilty if they choose another option other than the ultimate sacrifice. The movie is a bit slow at times with the extended dialogue on how the unit came to be and on the personal aspects of the characters. But I feel it is necessary to really understand the background of each character. The action scenes are few but are of the most realistic and emotional level like no other on this subject. The scene of the assault on the American task force left me in tears of how intense it was, watching the horror both our sailors and the Japanese pilots had to go through.
Like on the description specs of the disc, you'll need a region 2 player or like in my case a PS4 game console which can adjust to 4 out of 6 region formats.
If you are a fan of WWII history and liked movies like Letters From Iwo Jima, The Cross Of Iron, and Das Boot, where you get to see the unglorified side of the enemy, then you'll definitely enjoy this one.",1522713600,,1788,4.404833836858006
8435356,3,B004LYWFW2,"I found this film quite watchable and by moments even pretty good. Below some more detailed impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

This film tells the story of the young kamikaze pilots waiting to fly their missions from an air base in Japan, in the last months of war (May-August 1945). At 2h15 minutes, it is a long film and its pace is slow, almost never accelerating. Almost all the film is devoted to the preparations and waiting for the suicide mission, with some limited action being shown (briefly and not very well by the way) just towards the end.

This film definitely shows all the horrible but also deeply moving aspects of last days of life of those young pilots, who frequently didn't really volunteer but rather were designed to fly suicide missions and felt unable to desist themselves, mostly because of the social, hierarchical and peer pressure (and also for fear of being stygmatised as cowards). Still, many of them had doubts about the sense of their sacrifice in a time when war seemed already lost. Almost all tried to show their objections and their desire to live in some indirect way which stopped just short of open refusal to fly the mission. Those internal struggles, different and personal to every pilot, are the real topic of the film. They are not always easy to watch.

This is not a bad film, but it could be better if it was shortened a little. In the second half, I started to feel tired and a little bit bored rather than moved by the accumulation of farewells, poetry, songs, ceremonies and tears - even if I knew that it was a wrong reaction... Cutting half an hour and if necessary eliminating one or two characters would do a great deal of good to this film. Also, definitely the mission scenes could be much better.

Bottom line, this is a reasonably good film, definitely well showing the last moments of life of kamikaze pilots - but still, not good enough. Japanese directors made in the past some splendid masterpieces of cinema - it is a pity, that when such an exceptionally dramatic topic was concerned, this exploit couldn't be repeated.",1360540800,,2088,4.6811989100817435
