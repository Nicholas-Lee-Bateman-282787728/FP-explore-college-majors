What gets me is that they have chosen the wrong poster for the DVD edition, cause it's clearly Garbo who is in it, as any good fan could tell you. How can it be?",990403200,8,285,4.181818181818182

Vivien Leigh is gorgeous no matter if it's black or white and plays her role well.

956276,5,6305066833,"This is an exquisitely photographed and beautifully acted film that is amazingly faithful to the novel.  The story of Kitty and Levin is much neglected, but that seems to be the case with many adaptations of ""Anna Karenina.""  I thought Leigh's performance was tender, restrained and heartbreakingly  lovely. She comes across as gorgeous, magnetic, and unconsciously seductive and makes Vronsky's infatuation with Anna wholly believable.  All the casting was superb.  I first saw this film on late night television decades ago in the very early seventies, and it was what prompted me to read the entire novel cover to cover, introducing me to one of the greatest fiction accomplishments in literary history.  Now, having watched the film again, I find it in many ways as compelling as I did years ago.  Some might say it is dated, even a bit creaky; but I was again deeply moved by it, and marveled at its fidelity to the personality of Tolstoy's characters and his major themes.  Highly recommended.  I also note that you can see a digitally remastered version of this on Amazon Instant Video.  I think that's marvelous.  My review is for the DVD.",1425513600,16,1147,4.891191709844559

956342,2,6305066833,"Hugely disappointing I wanted to see it because of Vivienne Leigh!!  This version is proof that acclaimed wonderful  actress Vivienne Leigh and equally superb actor Ralph Richardson could not prove their abilities with a poorly written script!  Choice for portraying Vronsky equally poor choice.constant lambert 's orchestral background was inappropriate and distracting. Because this Tolstoy story is one of literatures greatest -I have wanted to view all versions available.greta Garbo as Anna was marvelous and more convincing-however she too dealt with a poorly written script!
The finest version in my opinion is the 1977 Anna Karenina starring Nicolas pagett! all characters so well developed in this slow burning saga.-thee disc 10 chapter version! scenery costumes -each and every detail of this visually gorgeous production on as many actual sites possible give tragedy and grandeur full reign!  So glad to have discovered it at this late date!!
Viewed the newest Anna at our local library! Kiera Knightly -always worth seeing-however she was misdirected in this over the top portrayal of too uninhibited Anna!",1405036800,,1119,5.488372093023256
956343,4,6305066833,"CLASSIC CHARM FROM A GOLDEN ERA OF FILM MAKING

1948 Karenina with Vivien Leigh and Kieron Moore
With all our advancements in cinema, we still may have not seen a more elegant Anna than Vivien Leigh nor a more dashing Vronsky than Kieron Moore.  I think the yearning in the early development of their relationship was also most palpable in this version (nearly 70 years old - time of writing this).  The scene where Vronsky and Anna acknowledge there love to each other is extraordinary.  It is set at an Opera after-party in Karenin's home where the guests are about to hold a s&eacute;ance and summon the spirit of a famous female lover.  Anna and Vronsky have gone to the side as the lights are turned down.  The moment where Anna sits with her tea, looking up into the camera (with that face!) and Vronsky turns to look at her, his eyes in the light but his face shadowed - one of the great cinematic pauses of all time!  Beautifully romantic.  This black and white production accomplishes what many modern ones cannot in the same run time.  The charm and style are different with classic movies and they have to be judged on their own merits.  For a long novel, this movie manages to maintain character development and plot connections that are often superficial in other attempts.  It takes tremendous skill and effort to do that.  Though it may not be my favorite above all others, it has some of my favorite moments and a merit of its own that will always survive.

BRIEF COMPARISONS TO OTHER EDITIONS with links to the product  (this list is not comprehensive and I apologize if a favored version is not represented.  I already watched nearly 24 hrs of video not counting research and writing!)  This list is not in order of precedence and each version has merits.  You can see slightly more detailed versions of my reviews like the paragraph above by going to each product page.

The Gold Standard of adaptations even after so many years.  Despite the 70's BBC acting style, this version has aged well with tremendous faithfulness to the book and ideas behind it.  Performances are melodramatic to today's audience, but so good they are relevant.  It is still my favorite rendition.  You must be up for nearly 10 hrs worth of story though.

This version is the next longest I viewed and fairly faithful to the plot and spirit of the book.  The acting style is more natural (less stage play melodramatic) and the entire focus seems to be on a realistic portrayal.  Lead actors less compelling than I would have liked.  This version will still be some peoples' favorite.  It is not mine.

Most visually stunning of the traditional adaptations, gorgeous cinematography and recognizable stars galore.  Despite all the stars, acting is uneven and accents all over the place.  Choppy story flow.  Still one of my favorites!

Shortened or edited version is somewhat lifeless though the flow is less choppy than other adaptations.  Badly in need of a restoration in video/sound quality and return of the lost footage not found in any copies I know of.

This is not for Tolstoy traditionalists!  However, the stunning visuals and choreographed set pieces really are brilliant.  It is set like a stage play and tends to swirl around a lot.

956443,5,6305066833,"I really enjoyed this film! It was so beautiful! The script was more clear than in the Garbo version, and every scene had a more in-depth feeling. I could empathize with all of the characters; and, the reason Anna would leave for a lover was better understood here without painting the husband as totally unlikeable.

Her lover, played by Kieron Moore, had more life, more warmth; you could feel his pining for her, without feeling he saw her as a momentary possession (as I felt was the case in the Garbo version). This is where it turned tragic as well, as we wish Anna could've believed his words of love for her.

Vivien delivers so much; her craft is wonderful to see. There is more than a personality coming through here, she delivers her character's tale most sharply. There is more of a psychological trip we are carried through with Anna in this film, as we hear her inner thoughts, and get glimpses of her fears; it is quite provoking. Her intelligence, and her lack of being apologetic are all felt. In such a society, Anna's vulnerability is seen as well.

956519,3,6305066833,"""Anna Karenina"" is a story of a 19th century married woman and mother who begins an affair that humiliates her high society husband.  The adaptation of Tolstoy's novel is a faithful but somewhat slow-moving black and white film.  The cinematography and imagery are fabulous, the costumes are beautiful and the star, Vivien Leigh is at the pinnacle of her beauty and acting ability.  She keeps you watching as she plays the tragic heroine Anna Karenina.  She is unhappily married to Alexei (Ralph Richardson) who spends much time in his home office tending to official business.  Anna has everything in her life, a beautiful home, successful husband and loving son.  Because she is bored, Count Vronsky (Kieron Moore) appeals to her senses, and she begins an affair that scandalizes the St. Petersburg high society

This 1948 movie captures the rich, luxurious era of Russia in the late 1800's, and Vivien Leigh keeps you watching closely as the short sweet romance causes shame, ostracism and disaster.",1285718400,4,1002,5.073170731707317

What I mostly wanted to add that other reviewers hadnt really mentioned was the superb acting of the entire cast, especially Vivian Leigh and Ralph Richarson.  Vivian is her best in this film with the exception of her role of Scarlett and Blanche in Streetcar of Desire.  I am totally in awe of Ralph Richardson's portrayal of the wronged husband and even though you can see how she fell for the younger dashing officer you really feel for him as he is if nothing else is an honorable man.

* Tolstoy: The Man Behind Anna
* The Tolstoy Legacy

I learned alot about Tolstoy and his beliefs including pacifism. His Christian beliefs were centered around the Sermon of the Mount. His stance on non-violence resistance had a major impact on Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.

956594,4,6305066833,"Vivien Leigh's return to films after a three-year absence was as the heroine of Tolstoy's literary classic, ANNA KARENINA.  Director Julien Duvivier (""The Great Waltz"", ""Pepe le Moko"") adds a nightmarish, haunted quality to this timeless tale of doomed love.

When Anna Karenina (Vivien Leigh) is called to Moscow to help mend a rift in her brother's marriage, she meets by chance the dashing Captain Vronsky (Kieron Moore) who immediately sets her world into a tailspin.  Here is the man who can save Anna from the cold indifference of husband Karenin (Ralph Richardson), yet to embark on an affair will mean turning her back on beloved son Sergei (Patrick Skipworth) and exposure to scandal and disgrace.

Vivien Leigh's performance as Anna is amongst her finest work; capping off a series of tragic heroines which included Myra in ""Waterloo Bridge"" and Emma Hamilton in ""That Hamilton Woman"".  Kieron Moore cuts a handsome figure as Vronksy; and Ralph Richardson is an incredibly sympathetic Karenin (world's apart from Basil Rathbone's one-note performance in the 1935 Garbo version).  Sally Ann Howes co-stars as Kitty, with Martita Hunt as Princess Betsy.

at the time, it could have been easily eclipsed by her health problems and her second husband laurence olivier, who was coming in to his prime as england's foremost actor.

but at the end of the film, leigh is showing where is she is headed as an actress. anna's great risk, her gamble and her loss are touchingly devastating.  she would cap on this with her performance as blanche du bois.

ralph richardson and kieron moore are also right in there as her husband karenin and lover vronsky.  moore is a whole lot of pretty in his uniforms, which is why he doesn't get the greatest press as an actor. he's good.  if duvivier had taken time, he might have gotten something of greater value from this actor.

956600,4,6305066833,"The Duvivier ANNA KARENINA has always been considered generally inferior to the Garbo MGM version, and for years was only available in substandard video transfers and dim revival prints.  Fox's spiffy new DVD is cause for rejoicing from film fans -- there's plenty to enjoy in this movie.  (Only the most dogged of completists will complain that the version on display is the American release print, some 12 or so minutes shorter than the British version.  Trust me, you won't miss the differences.)  The screenplay, credited to Jean Anouilh, among others, is the usual trot through the novel, with Kitty and Levin receiving their customary short shrift, the better to concentrate on Anna.  Leigh is in fine form here, tacking the last of her glamour roles in film with elegance and assurance.  Given the turmoil passion wreaked in Leigh's personal life, her Anna's perhaps a bit cool, but she's intelligent, fine-grained, and ultimately very moving.  As a nice plus, Leigh looks superb in her chic Beaton duds.  Richardson's ideal as Karenin, and, in a large and distinguised supporting cast, Sally Ann Howes' Kitty and Martita Hunt's Princess Betsy give particular pleasure.  (Michael Gough, in a bit part, manages to be as over-the-top irritating in a few lines as he was later in leads in such B-classics as KONGA and TROG, thereby putting the lie to my long-held opinion that he's an actor best suited to small parts.)  The picture's major weakness is Kieron Moore's Vronsky.  Handsome in a horse-faced way, he's no match for Leigh; their scenes together lack life and fire.  The director generally throws the scenes her way, and with good reason.  Even shrouded in semi-darkness, Moore looks lost.

956601,3,6305066833,"This is my least favorite version of Anna Karenina.  As an older movie it's intriguing, but I found it lacking in a few areas. The story of Kitty and Levin was pushed off to the side, so we miss the grand comparison of the ""more pure"" relationship with the ""devastatingly corrupt"" one. Vivien Leigh was a gorgeous Anna and portrayed her well, but Kieron Moore seemed too young to play Vronsky.

956655,4,6305066833,"First off, let us concede that neither the 1935 Greta Garbo ""Anna Karenina"" nor the 1948 Vivian Leigh version comes close to capturing the complexities of Tolstoy's masterpiece. Most significantly, Konstantin Levin and Kitty's relationship, and more particularly, Levin's protracted personal and metaphysical development, are dropped entirely, both screenplays preferring to treat the story as an adulterous romantic triangle with snowflakes instead of palm trees.

That said, what we are left with in both films are masterpieces of film craftsmanship, where the triple triumphs of cinematography, art direction, and costume design are the real stars.

Which is not in any way to lessen the contributions of the cast, who in both instances, make the best of what they have to work with.

Garbo enchants in many of her individual scenes, particularly with Freddy Bartholomew and Maureen O'Sullivan, (as Kitty). Who can forget her advising Kitty to seize her fleeting youth, with its promise of a dream prince to emerge from the blue haze of the mountain top. Equally impressive, is her muted aversion to Alexei Karenin, (Basil Rathbone).

But she fails in her depiction of a fatal love for Count Vronsky (Frederic March). Garbo, with her solemn, majestic and singular self possession--her ""Queen Christina"" like cerebral detachment, is simply too thoughtful, too deliberate, to in any way convey Tolstoy's impulsive, febrile and thoughtless anti-heroine.

True, she had forsaken all for John Gilbert in ""Christina,"" but that decision was the result of deep and thorough soul searching, and explained with the eloquence of Solomon to her courtiers. In ""Camille"" she is by profession a lover, and so her ultimate renunciation of Armand, reveals the true depth of her character. But one cannot conceive of her destroying the lives of others to satisfy a whimsical infatuation.

And this is where Miss Leigh's Anna trumps Garbo, for Miss Leigh does successfully transmit Anna's neurasthenic and utterly reckless collapse at the feet of the dashing Count. She seems blown by forces much stronger than she--a daffodil in a windstorm, and light years from Garbo's deep Scandanavian imperturbability.

Given the alleged similarities between Miss Leigh and Anna's disposition, perhaps this is life imitating art. In any case, it is why she makes a truer Anna, and why the role serves as a warm up for Blanche Dubois...

She is also abetted in her interpretation, by the genuinely eerie, recurring, nightmare sequence--with the Charon like, white bearded old man, forever dogging her as he chinks away at the ice. An ill omen indeed ! And Miss Leigh conveys the desperation of her impending doom in every gesture and nuance.

Then too Keiron Moore, (despite being an inferior actor to Frederic March) is much more dashing and handsome as Vronsky--a fact which, at least in terms of audience sympathy, helps explain the attraction.

Strangely, Mr. March who had been so visually appealing as Dr. Jeckyll, just a few years earlier, photographs very poorly in the Garbo version, and is not helped by a buzz haircut.

And as superb as Cedric Gibbons sets and Adrian's costumes are as a backdrop for Garbo, we feel Mr. Andrejew's art direction and Cecil Beaton's designs get the nod here as well, if only perhaps in their European origin, and the deep, appropriately moody nineteenth century shadows with which they are lit and photographed.

However, as visually sumptuous cinematic recreations of a vanished aristocratic world--each version has much to savor, and should be taken in tandem.",1171670400,23,3576,5.210801393728223

Arriving at the station Anna briefly makes the acquaintance of the Countess Son, Count Vronsky (The very young and dashing Kieron Moore) although the meeting was very brief Count Vronsky passion is sparked by Anna's beauty. While Anna is visiting Moscow the Count tries to pursue Anna, although Anna loves the attention and has a wonderful time she keeps her senses for she is already married with child to a very influential man in society.

Her loneliness and fears within, leads to a tragic end.

Directed by Julien Duviver and based on the book by Leo Tolstoy.

7881558,3,6305066833,"I only consider this as OK because the treatment of the story is characteristically conventional and typical of the way films were made back then.

I am only familiar with this 1948 version and the 2012 Keira Knightly production, which I prefer for it's exquisitely stylized aesthetics and the conceptual originality of the staging;  although there are more substantial reasons why I prefer the 2012 version, which I didn't expound upon in my review (which I have no intentions of re-writing).
In essence the 2012 film portrays the underhanded characteristics of the various participants in a decidedly unpleasant light.
There is no effort made to veil the distasteful scheming and enabling personality traits of the entourage of Anna's so called ""friends"" and her silent adversaries. That's it in a nutshell.

The 1948 version as I said is conventional, although it does have merit, but nothing to really write home about.
Aesthetically, this earlier version does manage to hold its own; Vivien Leigh's entrance at the ball is nothing short of breathtaking and the authenticity of the dance scene is a nice touch.
I'll bet you anything that the stunning ermine cape was the real deal; they didn't do faux fur in those days.
Her gown (now that's period couture), hair ornaments and jewelry were appropriately authentic for the period and Vivien Leigh was not just a pretty face with an exquisite coiffure; she possessed an understated personae of strength that eludes Keira Knightly; hence Ms. Leigh's casting as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.

I usually enjoy watching Ralph Richardson, but in this production his appearance is so shockingly bizarre and overdone that it's almost surreal.
F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu) would have been mighty pleased with Richardson's frightening and repulsive features.
The director was too heavy handed in conveying the fundamental differences in temperament between Anna and Karenin.
The conveyance of the treacherous evils of ""life at court"" as someone once described it are evident but the contrivances are rather banal and predictable. The seance scene comes as no surprise and is almost comical but it served it's purpose.
One has to remember that in 1948 there was an abundance of restrictions that guided movie makers; both legal, philosophical and Church dictates of morality.
All this being taken into account, the overall production isn't really that bad and there are a number of important scenes that in fact are better and more even handedly portrayed than in the 2012 version which isn't entirely guiltless of needlessly over the top depictions.

Then there are Greta Garbo, Nicola Paget slog with a plethora of other versions of this story; none of which I can be bothered with.
Garbo might do, although I sometimes tire of that sultry look and those laboriously affected mannerisms and speech.
Nicola Paget is not a gifted actress and is too pouty. She purses her lips well but that only takes you so far and her attempts at snob appeal are unconvincing.",1488758400,,3008,5.080971659919029
7881559,4,6305066833,"The above cry of the heart from Anna (Vivien Leigh) to her cuckholded husband Karenin (Ralph Richardson) could have been Vivien Leighs own apologia to her first husband Leigh Holman for deserting their young daughter Suzanne & him for Laurence Olivier eleven years earlier.  As with her later film The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, the autobiographical elements may have hit too close to home for comfort.  Sufficient to say, overall filming this movie wasn't a happy experience for her.  First the role was a consolation prize; Miss Leigh had wanted to play Ophelia to her husband Laurence Oliviers Hamlet in his cinema adaption of Shakespeares tragedy.  She was turned down by the production team and Olivier as too old at thirty four for the teenaged Ophelia.  More seriously, her manic depression was steadily worsening, plus her growing anxiety that her acting talent would never measure up to Oliviers. The latter was exacerbated by Oliviers being honored with a knighthood for his theatrical achievements. This was compounded by a director Julian Duvivier who disagreed with Miss Leighs  interpretation of Anna and a costar Kieron Moore as Count Vronsky with whom she had little chemistry.  Finally, Leigh would be taking on a role that had already been successfully played by screen icon Greta Garbo.

Lets begin with Garbo versus Leigh; each in her own way is a memorable Anna Karenina, and both look spectacular dressed in Annas famous black ball gown.  Garbo is perhaps better in the early scenes establishing Annas charm and gaiety.  Oddly Leigh's vivacity is muted and subdued in the same sequences, puzzling when you consider her vibrant, charismatic Scarlett OHara.  However in the final scenes Leigh has the edge over Garbo totally destroyed by a passion that has consumed her.  Garbo seems more rueful, but still with some vestiges of self-possession.  The viewer might be surprised when Miss Garbos Anna suddenly casts herself under the wheels of a train, not so with the Anna of Miss Leigh, it seems inevitable.  Her performance gains in strength and power as the film darkens and Annas character begins to deteriorate, tormented by her guilt and desperation.  In some ways it foreshadows her next film performance as Blanche du Bois.  In her final scenes you feel for Anna as she realizes she has lost everything that matters gambling on a love affair with a man unworthy of her.  In appearance, Miss Leigh is exquisite; her beauty is heightened by the sumptuous yet  elegant gowns of the celebrated designer Cecil Beaton.

The film is seriously hampered by the casting of Kieron Moore as Count  Vronsky.  Although handsome  he lacks the dash and panache Vronsky should possess in contrast  to the somber, stolid Karenin.  Moore's playing is callow and tentative, he and Leigh don't click, and the grand amour between them necessary for the story to succeed just isn't there.  Some writers have claimed Olivier needed to play the part for the film to work.  Myself, I don't agree, I think he would have been too old for Vronsky.  However James Mason, Stewart Granger or  David Farrar who had registered in the Deborah Kerr film Black Narcissus  might have pulled it off.  The most fully realized performance is that of Ralph Richardson as Karenin, there is a subtlety and complexity unlike that of Basil Rathbone's one dimensional playing in Garbos version.  He actually evokes both pity and sympathy; you feel that in his own way he does love Anna, but doesnt understand her.

The production itself is lavish and handsome in the sets and costumes, the screenplay is serviceable, but the cinematography is dark and dull, quite inferior to its Hollywoods MGM counterpart.  Sadly this was reflected at the box office where the film was dismissed as a beautiful failure, while Oliviers Hamlet released in the same year 1948 went on to triumph both critically and financially.

In her regrettably limited screen appearances, Miss Leigh's full glory as an incandescent star was best served by the professionalism and polish of the Hollywood studios. The British studios didn't quite match the results.  Even so, any film with Vivien Leighs presence deserves a viewing, and her wounded, passion haunted Anna will move you to pity as she gallantly and nobly meets her fate on the dark, rainswept railroad tracks.",1477699200,,4323,5.007002801120448
