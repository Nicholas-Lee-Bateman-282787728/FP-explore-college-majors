3778418,4,B001RTCP24,"This compelling movie explores what happens to a young, bright man, talented in physics (cosmology) who leaves China to become a graduate student at the US university.  His eagerness to please his academic adviser, strong personal desire to bring honor to his family and youthful ambition puts him at odds with his peers, university professors and politics of academia.

This young man's only support is compassion of a local socialite who has sincere personal interest in Chinese culture and who take her personal interest in this bright, young man.

When things start to fall apart like house of cards for this young, brilliant man he falls into a deep end from which there is no escape.  This is an amazing study of human conflict, cultural differences and shattered dreams.",1258502400,9,777,5.0
3778419,4,B001RTCP24,"DARK MATTER is a harrowing movie about a young genius's attempt to earn a Ph. D., share his ground-breaking ideas about the universe, and improve the lives of his parents and himself. Well scripted and well acted, it rings true.

SPOILER ALERT: at the end, after being repeatedly thwarted by his major advisor/professor and his committee, he ""goes postal."" All of us who follow the news can recall similar horrific conclusions to real-life stories of academic pressure and frustration.

Looking back on my own career, as a retired college professor who taught for 37 years and who spent 6 years earning my own advanced degrees, I can vouch for the general nastiness of the academic world since the late 1950s. Most academics, despite pretensions to living in an Ivory Tower, swim in a Shark Tank--and sadly many of those who succeed in that environment become the sort of shark-like person who perpetuates it. Power corrupts, whether in government, businesses, or our universities.

Viewers/reviewers who were expecting any sort of upbeat ending to this film were probably not paying attention--or perhaps were imagining they were seeing an academic film that was kindred to A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2002) or GOOD WILL HUNTING (1998).

Liu Xing (Ye Liu), Johanna Silver (Meryl Streep), and Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn) are the three main characters (stars) of this film--respectively the genius graduate student, the helpful and sympathetic culture maven, and the powerful, egotistical, self-promoting professor.

Watch this at your own peril. By the way, I do not plan to recommend this to many of my academic friends: most of them are good souls with tender hearts, who would find it stirring up far too many bad memories about their own careers.",1253404800,35,1739,5.087719298245614

3778421,4,B001RTCP24,"Let's make this perfectly clear: This movie is a tragedy. There is little to no indication of that fact on the box. You might pop it in, expecting an ending that would satisfy all the frustration you experience which builds throughout. No such luck! You start off happy, become increasingly frustrated, and end absolutely horrified. There should be a warning!

I admit, I am the type that usually likes movies with happy endings. Even then, if I know a movie is going to be tragic, I can at least make a decision whether or not I would like to watch it, and when. I was left feeling angry and empty.

Does the movie make a good point? Yes. But, you can get at the same point by simply reading the news! Do you learn how dog-eat-dog academia is? Yes - but was this a hidden fact? Do you learn that there are cultural differences that can lead to frustration? No news there.

This movie attempts to offer an explanation as to why the impending tragedy occurs.

I am angry up to the teeth. So why did I give it a four star review? My review is based on typical movie stuff. It was well acted. It was well written. It was well directed. Be forwarned. It is well... depressing!",1250640000,5,1172,4.337899543378995
3778422,2,B001RTCP24,The first 2/3 of this movie are spent developing the characters of Liu Xing and Prof Reiser and then all the strongest character traits of those two people are just tossed aside for the ridiculous ending.  That made the entire film a complete waste of time.  You're left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why.  Anyone with a shred of intellect isn't going to be moved by this except maybe to anger at having squandered 90 minutes on it.  It could have been a decent movie.  It did have a really cheap quality about it as you never see ANY other students at the school.,1247529600,8,585,4.429906542056075
3778423,3,B001RTCP24,"The overall film could have been a nice, tight little drama with a message except for the ending and without the gratuitous ""arty"" efforts throughout.  Rather than adding anything, they interrupted the mood and the plot progression, IMHO.  Otherwise, I thought it rated a 3 but I still wonder why I had never heard of it when it was first released nor at any time since.  As far as Meryl playing a cultural air-head, she shouldn't have...the character wasn't terribly believable or sympathetic. Conversely, the mean-spirited Quinn nailed his role.
Unfortunately, in this current era, the ending was all too plausible and was truly a ""Dark Matter"".",1241654400,7,647,5.02803738317757
3778424,2,B001RTCP24,"Admittedly the Chinese student coming to America to pursue his dream of obtaining his Ph. D. as well as the Nobel Prize for his ""major breakthrough"" with regard to dark matter saw his dreams shattered when his dissertation topic was rejected.  However, without giving away the details of the story's ending, let's just say that the actions taken by the student at the conclusion of the film seemed totally at odds with what we had seen of his character throughout the film and totally out of proportion as a reaction to the severe disappointment that he had experienced.  If the writer or director intended to put forth some sort of warning to the academic establishment as to what can happen when a promising student's ideas are disregarded, the attempt failed due to being too heavy-handed.  Any sympathy that might be felt by the viewer for the student's plight quickly vanishes as a result of his unjustified actions at the end of the film.  I am not saying that it was necessary for the film to have a happy ending, just that a different one could have been chosen.",1241481600,6,1070,4.675531914893617

3778426,4,B001RTCP24,"DARK MATTER is a film that will polarize audiences: for those who seek understanding of the clashes between science and 'religion' and the matrix from which tragedy grows the film will appeal, and for the audiences who demand tidy stories with happy resolutions the film will not please.  Apparently 'based on true events', this story has many layers that invite discussion and reveals some facts about the American Academia that many would rather not know.

Liu Xing (Ye Liu) comes from a poor family in Beijing, but rises to hopeful heights due to his exceptional scientific intelligence and is invited to a prestigious university to study with Cosmology professor Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn), the author of the Reiser String Theory - the entire universe is tied into a compact single ball of  cosmic wax.  Liu Xing encounters initial success not only academically but also as a fresh young student, barely able to speak English, who is taken under the wing of the kind matron of Chinese culture,  Johanna Silver (Meryl Streep).  Liu Xing develops his own theory that the universe is united by massive amounts of unseen Dark Matter.  When the student's theory conflicts with Reiser's theory, the negative results begin to affect each of the characters: Liu Xing sees his dream of earning a PhD in Cosmology and winning the Nobel Prize for his theory destroyed by the powers of academia and as he watches his fellow Chinese students succeed, he is plagued with low self esteem as he attempts to support his family in Beijing with money earned selling cosmetics door to door. The downfall of a simple genius destroyed by the inner workings of academia leads to unimaginable tragedy.

Billy Shebar's screenplay tinkers with the story's credibility with a heavy dose of sentimentality at times, but director Shi-Zheng Chen keeps the story moving by allowing the audience to witness frequent glimpses of Liu Xing's humble Beijing home life.  The star of the film is the very talented Ye Liu, but Streep and Quinn carry their rather minor roles with great dignity and understatement. This is a moving story, too frequently repeated in our campuses to overlook.  There is much more to this film than first viewings reveal.  Grady Harp, April 09",1240012800,59,2238,4.957219251336898

3778438,1,B001RTCP24,"I was very disappointed in this film.  Meryl Streep is one of the finest actresses of our time and this is the second film she has starred in that I have found very unsatisfactory.  Although claiming to be based on a true story, it completely alters the actual events---Hollywood doesn't let truth deter ""artistic license"" if it will sell more tickets or the producers wish to present a specific viewpoint.  The film did demonstrate the severe clash between American and Chinese cultures in regard to saving face and the effects of not achieving the academic success and recognition a brilliant foreign student believed was his due.  The student wanted to make his parents proud and fabricates tales of success in his letters to his parents who have sacrificed to enable him to study in the U.S. One reviewer wrote that the young doctoral student had no way out and this lead to his final actions; he may have believed that was the case but an individual always has other options. It is a depressing and slow-moving film and definitely has an anti-academia bias to the story.  If I had it to do over I would not have bought this movie or even watched it.",1352678400,4,1154,4.637254901960785
3778439,1,B001RTCP24,"I have read several reviews of this movie by people who described how moving and thought-provoking it is to them and based on a true story and all. Gee. Apparently none of these people was curious enough to investigate the ""true story"" (used to sell the film) itself. Also, several fine American actors lent their reputations to this film without (one hopes)realizing that the script completely reverses responsibility for the massacre perpetrated at the University of Iowa in 1991 by a mass murderer, a Chinese student named Gang Lu. Lu, a cold-blooded psychopath who had been awarded his PhD., with premeditation murdered four(FOUR!)faculty members and another student because he did not receive a prestigious prize in his field, astronomy-physics. He then killed himself. Dark Matter transforms this monster into the charming, brilliant twinkle toes we see being treated shabbily by unworthy faculty. Lest any of the bleeding heart supporters of the film imagine that Gang Lu was the victim of an anti-Chinese plot, the actual winner of the prize was another Chinese student, a woman.

Lest anyone think I am too strident in my message, check out the facts:  wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa_shooting

This film was directed by a hack director,Shi-Zheng Chen, who re-wrote history to make a Chinese butcher into a hero. The Chinese government does this all the time. Chen then enlisted a crew of credulous (clueless) Americans to dishonor the memory of the good people slaughtered by a monster, real victims who are now insulted by an equally clueless American public.

3778443,3,B001RTCP24,"I was totally ready to give Dark Matter a 1 or 2-star rating, but then the final 3 minutes of the movie left me speechless and took the plot in a VERY shocking direction.

I can't stress enough just how crucial that ending was in saving what would have surely been a lackluster and disappointing movie.

Anyway the storyline is about a Chinese boy who comes to America with his radical theories about the universe, and takes a college course where he has to deal with a professor who is either secretly jealous of his original and groundbreaking theories, or doesn't seem interested.  I was never sure just where the professor stood on the matter.  We only know he doesn't welcome the students theory.

The problem?  The movie is caught between trying to tell a drama story involving the Chinese boy getting the chance to go out on a date with an American girlfriend and just becoming a regular American kid, and trying to explain his theories on the subject of dark matter in the universe.

You never really care about his girlfriend because these scenes were completely undeveloped and rushed, and his opinions on the universe never really seemed thought-provoking enough to supply any alternative reasoning.  So the storyline doesn't work either way.

Also, Merycl Streep was pumping out very good movies a few years ago when her popularity really elevated to greater heights, so it's surprising that during this time her lackluster and underutilized role in this movie was created.

That ending though... wow what an ending!  It saves Dark Matter completely.",1285977600,,1562,4.878787878787879
3778444,4,B001RTCP24,"""Dark Matter"" is a film loosely based on the true story of Gang Lu, a Chinese student who comes to the United States and kills four faculty members and one student at the University of Iowa.  The star of the film is Liu Xing (Liu Ye), an only child in China's one child economy.  His parents are hardworking and striven all their lives for him to have an education and be somebody.  Liu is brilliant and wants to win the  Nobel Prize.  He arrives at Valley State University and does his best to transition into American life.  He has the help of Joanna Silver (Meryl Streep), a patron of the arts, who also admires Chinese culture.  She takes a liking to the young student and sees his potential.  Liu is interested in cosmology and is mentored by his hero, the famous cosmologist Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn).  Jacob is proud of his student's industrious ways and says he is brilliant to Joanna, but though he initially supports Liu, he is threatened by Liu's achievements in detecting and analyzing dark matter in the universe.

We see the dark underbelly of academia and the rivalry between researchers when individuals make breakthroughs that conflict with superiors.  Unexpected obstacles appear, including politics, and understanding of what different cultures expect.

Overall the film is an interesting slice of academia, research, competition, cultural issues and expectations of a rising genius who must confront the dark forces of insecure egos.",1277424000,6,1454,4.962809917355372

All Liu Xing ever wanted was to study the origins of the universe at a Western university. Upon arriving at the school, Liu immediately rents a modest apartment with a few other Chinese students and begins flirting with the pretty American who works at the local coffee shop. Personally welcomed into Department Head Jacob Reiser's select cosmology group, Liu remains dedicated to his studies and optimistic about the future. Things continue to look up as Liu becomes close with wealthy university patron Johanna Silver after the two become acquainted at an orientation for foreigners sponsored by a local church. Eventually, Liu becomes Reiser's protg, and makes a sizable impression at a prestigious conference attended by the pair. But attitudes start to shift when Liu's studies in dark matter come into direct conflict with his mentor's prominent theories and well-established studies. His excitement about a potential breakthrough causes him to ignore repeated warnings that he must pay his dues, and Liu's findings are eventually eclipsed by that of more studious fellow student Laurence. Determined to have his studies published, Liu goes behind Reiser's back, but he ultimately becomes the target of ire rather than accolades, with Johanna's nave encouragement prompting him along a dangerous collision course. While Liu remains enamored with the concept of the American dream and optimistic about American science being a free market of ideas, he begins to grow dejected after his dissertation is rejected, the girl at the coffee shop blows him off, and his roommates all find lucrative jobs. Essentially left behind at the university, Liu rejects Johanna's offer for help and vows not to return home to disappointed parents. Now, as he coasts on the fumes of his unrealized dreams, the dishonored student prepares to lash out with one final act of devastating annihilation.

The movie is a thrilling examination of the origins of the universe, the dark side of cutthroat academics, and the pursuit of the American dream. Director Chen Shi-Zheng's film has a graceful energy, and three strong performances help make this serene drama and its shocking conclusion a quietly moving film. What makes it not great is the fact that the creaky plotting, inscrutable characters, and unconvincing ending make it difficult for audiences to connect with it.

8338703,1,B001RTCP24,"It was said the film is based on the 1991 Iowa City massacre. It is a shame that this film completely reverses the responsibility for the massacre. It is unethical to produce a film like this.

The true story is: 28-year-old PhD student Lu Gang had received his doctoral degree the previous May (in the film, he could not get his PhD degree, because of those rotten professors) but believed a scholarship that went to his rival Shan Linhua, should have been his. Months before the shootings, he wrote five letters explaining the reasons for his planned actions. Four of the letters are in English and were intended to be sent to news organizations. One is in Chinese. According to the university, Lu said in the letters that he was angry and jealous that his doctoral dissertation had not received a prestigious academic award.

I am so disappointed to see that Meryl Streep starring this film. It is unbelievable that Meryl Streep did not recognize the deadly flaw this movie has when she read the script.

According to the director, Meryl Streep even said she felt ""the story was important because it wasn't about a poor, struggling immigrant; it was about a brilliant mind that could potentially contribute to society"".

But the true story was not related to a brilliant mind that could potentially contribute to society, it was about a dark soul which is extremely greedy. As a Chinese-American, I have to say, I consider the China-born, New York-based director, Chen Shi-Zheng, an immoral villain.
