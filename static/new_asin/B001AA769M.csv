8276507,5,B001AA769M,"This is the video shown at the Smithsonian Native American museum.  It shows four lives of current ""modern"" Indians going about their lives.  My husband and I portray eastern woodland Indians 1750 to 1812 and the public constantly asks if this is the way we live.  This video brings natives to the real world.  We are still here, even posting a review on Amazon.  Great educational tool for any one educating about Native Americans.  We love all Chris Eyre work.",1400889600,4,462,4.7125
