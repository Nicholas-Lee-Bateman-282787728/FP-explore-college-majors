8058327,3,B00096S3R2,"In the 2300's, interstellar travel takes place using ""inflation gates"". These gates use wormholes to pass through different dimensions. Through these wormholes, an enemy called a ""GHOUL"" comes into our world. A group of female pilots has arrived at the space station Watcher's Nest to complete their pilot training. Among them is Misaki Kureha, who lost her father in an accident at watchers nest over 10 years ago. She has come there to learn the truth. The general public isn't aware of the GHOULS. So when the new pilots encounter them, they are very surprised. Misaki learns that they are the reason her father died, and that she has a strange connection to GHOULS.

This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized. Most of this series was spent with the science officer and a big shot jerk talking vaguely about Misaki's potential powers. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you. If you can rent it before buying it, I recommend doing that before you buy it.",1353801600,,1836,4.666666666666667
8058328,4,B00096S3R2,"As with much of this mini-series noted for it's ridiculously buxom female characters, you begin not to notice the character designs but the actual story that's going on. I think the fact that you start paying attention to the story is testament that the writing is actually pretty good.

In this volume we get to the end of the show and the loose ends get tied up rather well. The pseudo-science is quite interesting as the disturbing plot twists keep coming and the horror of the watcher's nest and it's citizens is revealed.

 . . . Misaki finds out just what she is . . .

The horror is more cerebral than anything but it should make you think.

The best meter that I have for any anime is RE-watch-ability. The 3-D CGI leaves something to be desired but the character development and the ideas that are tossed at you can make you go back and dig for more.

I just wish the girls weren't bustier than Dolly Parton . . but, like I said, I think you'll get past it.",1122249600,3,966,4.30939226519337
8058329,5,B00096S3R2,"The third and final volume for season 1 of Divergence Eve brings startling suspense, horror, and shocking revelations.
Trying to do her best, Misaki cannot help but fear that the path she is going, is possibly the wrong one. When Watcher's Nest tries to stop the Ghoul, an event will occur that was foreshadowed in the first episode, bringing a sad and horrible death to one of the cast. The death is nothing short of bloody, and adds sadness to the death of the character. However, LeBlanc, one of the Watcher's Nest crew, has plans for Misaki, and those plans don't involve saving the station or its crew. After some horrible truths and turns of events, Misaki is left at a point where her choice could decide the fate of everyone she knows.
And with season 1 done, season 2 dubbed ""Divergence Eve: Misaki Chronciles"", continues the story, but isn't yet released on DVD. The music for this last DVD for season 1 continues to play well, and the character interaction is top notch. Once again, though the women may be 'big', it doesn't detract from the story. Much like the two DVDs, some fan service is there, but it's not over powering, and the women act like normal women. The mood is very dark and tragic, and some scenes are even hard to stomach. Now we can't help but bite our lips in anticipation as we now have to wait for season 2 of Divergence Eve to be released.
ADVfilms has brought a very good series to DVD. This has the classic sci-fi feel that some other anime series lack. For those who liked the previous 2 DVDs will surely get this one. The only thing to do now at this point, is wait for season 2 to come out.",1120953600,2,1629,4.415282392026578
