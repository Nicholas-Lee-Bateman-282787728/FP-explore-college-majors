8152639,5,B000JQ8HQE,"This is a great film if you love St. Petersburg. The characters are endearing, and the language is clear. I showed it to Russian classes in a high school, skipping a couple of the smoking and drinking scenes, but even those weren't extreme enough to make me worry. Lots of great cultural notes. It's a rom-com, but there's still a nice message about how we have to be intentional about life decisions.",1464307200,,401,4.583333333333333

8152642,5,B000JQ8HQE,"It's about a girl who works at a radio station who drops her cell while bumping into a person on the street. It's about a guy, an architect, who picks this phone up, intending to return it to her. They keep arranging to meet, but will they ever? It's about their parallel lives, and their fates. Very touching, very real acting, and since it takes place in St. Petersburg - very beautiful. The film is light hearted, and non melodramatic. A bit funny, a bit amusing, a bit airy and thoughtful.

Highly recommend it.",1164326400,8,515,4.4787234042553195
