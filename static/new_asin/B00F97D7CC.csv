I do wish that they dubbed it or added English subtitles, but oh well.",1447632000,,230,4.111111111111111
8613259,3,B00F97D7CC,I like the fact that the movie comes in english dubbed with subtitle... the downside is the copy I received looks fake..  The movie cover looked like it was printed off the computer and placed in a dvd cover.  I was quit disappointed.  But overall I am happy that it works and the movie quality looks great :).,1415145600,2,310,4.310344827586207
8613260,3,B00F97D7CC,It's completely in Japanese. No English dub no English subs. So if you don't mind not knowing what they're saying totally go for it.,1414368000,,132,4.541666666666667
8613261,5,B00F97D7CC,"I really enjoyed it, but it would of been way better as a full movie would of given it more time or atleast more episodes to be able to show more of the nostalgia of how well they translated everything from the game to the film. Even then this blu-ray is totally worth the buy... Menu language is not in English but the audio is definitely there",1407369600,2,345,4.164179104477612
8613262,4,B00F97D7CC,"I bought this bluray, could anyone tell me how to access the english dub please? Im not sure it even has english dub",1401926400,,116,4.086956521739131
8613263,4,B00F97D7CC,"Even though there's no dub or subtitles it's a really good addition to your anime collection, there's also some trailers for Pokemon X and Y.",1401840000,4,141,4.68
8613264,5,B00F97D7CC,"First of all the Blu Ray is great. Its Japanese but its region free and plays just fine in both my PS3 and PS4, my Xbox One did not want to play it though, not sure about standard Blu Ray players. Also its great because it has English Subtitles and the English Dub is even included on Disc.

Now the Show. Despite being only 4 episodes and a pretty abridged series, its very awesome and faithful to the games. It follows Red and his Rival Blue thorough pretty much the Generation 1 games. It even uses music and sound effects from the games and ends up being very nostalgic. The battles are also very well done and action packed. Overall its the way the Pokemon anime should have been and i am jealous that this is only 4 episodes and not more. The Dub is also solid and well one in my opinion. I really recommend this to Pokemon fans, especially Generation 1 fans since i think they will get the most out of this.

There are not really many special features to speak of though, just some trailers for Pokemon X and Y, as well as trailers for this show. Still a great buy for a Pokemon fan.",1401148800,5,1090,4.2105263157894735
8613265,5,B00F97D7CC,If you are from the USA make sure you buy this Blu Ray from Animenation. Since it is region free and includes both the Japanese audio along with the English dub. The picture is excellent so it is not a bootleg and the audio is amazing. Awesome series!,1400716800,6,251,4.25
8613266,5,B00F97D7CC,Awesome ass movie it was better then the origina USA version of the show I wish it was all like that,1382832000,5,100,3.8095238095238093
