4331161,3,B004D2GMQW,"This is a review of the English Dubbed version of Vampire Knight so far. As someone who has seen the entire Vampire Knight series in Japanese, I was very excited to hear that it was being dubbed in English. I have now watched the first four episodes of the English dub. Many people were worried about the choice of Vic Mignogna for the role of Zero, but in my personal opinion, Vic's performance is the strongest of the the three leads. While his voice may not be 100% perfect for Zero, his great acting skills make up for it, and he does pitch his voice to a lower register (a tone reminiscent of his performance as Ikkaku in ""Bleach).  Yuki's English voice is a pretty decent fit, but the acting fluctuates in skill - sometimes it is good and sometimes it is lacking. Kaname's English actor was, in my opinion, the weakest choice. His voice does not really match the character and the acting is very flat. I can only hope that he will improve as the series progresses. The supporting cast is actually pretty good. Headmaster Cross, Aido, Seiren, Kain, Yori, Ruka, and many of the other smaller characters are well-acted and enjoyable.

Overall, the series is decent. It is nice not to have to read subtitles and the English dub helped me understand certain plot points that confused me in Japanese. The leads could be stronger, but the supporting cast is quite good.",1279929600,22,1368,4.579591836734694
4331162,4,B004D2GMQW,"There are several reviews already up about what the story is about but here i'll just focus on the dub.

I love anime and I watch my anime in English as a general rule. So I was waiting excitedly for this to come out. I've read the manga and have a fairly good understanding of each of the characters. That being said I did not like the voice choices for most of the characters. I realize the Japanese picked the dub voices but Zero should have more ""edge"" to his voice he is NOT a soft or happy person and Vic makes him too soft. Unless he's having a blood craving or angry. Both of those things Vic does very very well...but when he's just talking to Yuki or Kaname he's way to soft not enough edge.

Yuki's voice just annoys me but I tried listening to it in Japanese and she annoyed me there too so I think she is supposed to just generally be annoying.

Kaname was actually okay, I thought he needed to be a litttle softer in some parts and harder in others but overall of the main three I liked him best.

Aido and his cousin were perfectly cast as far as i'm concerned Troy Baker puts in an awesome performance as Akatsuki Kain, Aido's cousin and Kaname's right hand man. While Aido is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook who I have never seen before this. However they were both awesome and very much like there characters.

Honorable mention goes out to Steve Staley who plays Shiki, Senri and only had four lines in the first four episodes but made the character in those four lines. I am excited to see him again in the next set. Also Christopher Corey Smith who plays Headmaster Cross was brilliant. I could see Vic playing the headmaster or J Micheal Tatum but Chris Smith did an amazing job and I was very happy with it. I am also excited about Travis Willingham playing the Vampire hunter sent to the school in the next set. That character is made for him and he will be awesome i've got no doubt.

But if you like dubs you may enjoy this, and I know my views about the cast will be different for everyone so enjoy it and make up your own mind. I just preferred the sub cast to the main three.",1279929600,,2099,4.221945137157107
4331163,2,B004D2GMQW,"I love Vampire Knight. I love the manga and the anime. However, the only good thing about this is the pictures. The voices seem off. i know, it's hard to find a good actor for the character, but I think they could have done better here. I find fandubs are better. I prefer to order it off Netflix, which is a better idea than buying this. There are only 4 episodes, each almost was painful to watch. Like I said, I love Vampire Knight, but I think Viz should have left it alone. I prefer the subs.",1279843200,2,497,4.134020618556701
4331164,5,B004D2GMQW,"I'm really excited for the dubbed to be finally coming out. I enjoy the sub version so much but it will be nice to be able to listen to it in a language I understand more. Like many people I am a little worried about the dubbed voice actors. Not so much Vic, who will play zero, because the character he voiced in the Air series was also a pretty ""depressed"" character. But I'm wondering how Yuki's voice is going to sound. The voice actresses for her in the sub I feel is just so perfect. But all in all I'm excited for the dub because this is one of my favorite animes, just because I enjoy the characters and their relationships. =D",1278979200,8,635,4.170731707317073
4331165,3,B004D2GMQW,"""Vampire Knight"" is the story of a high school girl torn between two platonic lovers; or four fangs, in this case.  After all, when it comes to vampire fiction, any horror noob knows that a vampire's bite is essentially synonymous with sex. And since so many romantic anime are so annoyingly coy about physical expressions of affection, that makes vampires a welcome addition to the shojo (girlie anime) genre.  Now the heroine is free to get her rocks off and the boys have to do all the sucking for once.  Now I know what you're thinking: ""is this an anime version of Twilight? Well, sorta kinda, yeah. But it isn't all that bad.  In fact, it wasn't far from being really good. The vampire mythology is unique without deviating too far from established genre norms and some of the characters are quite likeable. As far as vampire anime goes, you could do worse. There have been two seasons, with the second titled ""Vampire Knight Guilty"". This is a review of the first 13-episode season.

Yuki is the adoptive daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy; a social experiment where humans go to school during the day, and vampires attend at night. Yuki is a Prefect (guardian), which is to say it's her job to keep the peace along with her partner Zero, who comes from a family of renowned vampire hunters that were slaughtered by a powerful ladyvamp.  Since every girl in the day class is smitten with every boy in the night class-who are prone to temptation- this is a rough job. While Zero's fierce demeanor is enough to keep the screaming throngs of wannabe Bellas in check, the diminutive and soft-spoken Yuki has a comically hard time with crowd control. The vampires and hunters work together to exterminate any stray vampires who go out of control, known as level E's.  The problem is that Zero was bitten by the pureblood who killed his family and has been devolving into a type E ever since due to his body's rejection of the blood tablets that the other vampire's use for sustenance. Yuki has a mad crush on the pureblooded leader of the night class, Kaname, who saved her from a level E when she was little, but she feels obligated to help the suffering Zero which leads her to break the school's deepest taboo and reject her longtime friend and protector.

The series mixes splashes of amusing character comedy with some heavier-toned drama. The results are mixed on this.  Any scene with Yuki and Zero is likely to be several minutes of a trembling anime girl with ultra-puppy dog eyes whimpering his name every five seconds and telling him she'll take care of him no matter what.  Then there's the scenes with Kaname and Yuki which is usually her blushing and stammering his name every ten seconds as he cooly stares at her.  Gets old fast.  And on the other side, Headmaster Cross's buffoonish demeanor and nearly incestuous enthusiasm for his adoptive daughter is nothing but irritating. Most of the time, Vampire Knight strikes a pretty good balance, but it regularly tips too far one way or the other. The biggest problem with the first season is that it often doesn't play to it's strengths. There is an entire cast of interesting vampire characters that are barely paid lip service in spite of the fact that they are the main draw. Most of the time is spent on the Zero/Yuki/Kaname love triangle plot which drags the series down often.  But whenever a level E is onscreen, major animated creepiness ensues.  If they'd focused more on the vampire hunting aspect, this would have been an outstanding show.

In Vampire Knight the vamps fall into four levels. Level E's are essentially beasts in human form with no self control and will feed on humans every chance they get.  Most of the cast are noble vampires who are able to control themselves to some degree, though are often tempted to partake in the delicacy of human blood.  They each have a superpower, such as controlling an element or one who can use his blood as a weapon similar to the excellent Night Walker anime.  These powers are rarely used in the first season. Pureblood vampires are rare and directly descended from the vamps of old with no human blood mixed into their lineage. They are the only vampires capable of turning a human into one of them, and their status is so exclusive that only they themselves know the extent of their powers. Ex-human vampires have been bitten by a pureblood and slowly devolve into type E's unless their sire decides to bestow the gift of their blood upon them.  All of the characters of Vampire Knight can walk in the day, though it's implied that vamps can get a nasty sunburn from doing so. Biting somebody is a very intimate affair to these guys/gals and can lead to some jealousy, which goes without saying considering the sexual implications.  Prep for drama.

Sanctioned vampire hunters have a list of targets that are cleared for extermination. They are not allowed to run amok as there is a human/vampire truce going on.  Only type E's or murderers are executed and nobles or hunters are cleared to do the deed.  The main hunter is actually one of the night class teachers at Cross Academy. Gotta love a sensei who jokes about killing his students that fall asleep during his lectures.  Great character; way underused, though.  In fact, every cast member who isn't Zero, Kaname, Yuki, or Headmaster Cross are underused for most of the season.  And I just named the four lamest characters in the show. I wish they'd focused on the night class more; now there are some interesting characters. But things pick up big time as the first season climaxes. A new cast member shows up with ties to Zero's past (you've already guessed, I'm sure) and she is absolutely fantastic onscreen. Saved the entire series for me, in fact.

The soundtrack to Vampire Knight is pretty good, with lots of traditional gothic organs setting the appropriate mood. The opening and closing credits are solid as well. The art is very nice to look at and somewhat resembles a darker Death Note, which is high praise. And as always, I love the creepiness of the glowing red eyes.  Overall, the series is probably a must for anime fans who are into gothic vampire melodrama, and a casual recommendation for general nosferatu freaks like myself.  I could name at least half a dozen vampire animes that are better off the top of my head, but with the success of Twilight, this one is all set to break big when it comes to America.  It may even create a new wave of otaku.  Don't know how I feel about that.  The horror and violence in this is pretty light and there are but a few action scenes in the 13 episodes of the first season, but there is a good story here with some outstanding supporting characters so as long as you aren't expecting Hellsing you'll probably have a good time with Vampire Knight.",1277251200,13,6803,4.648040033361134
4331166,4,B004D2GMQW,"The anime isn't quite as faithful to the manga as the other review claims. Some elements are changed, and while for the most part the story is the same, unfortunately the portrayal of the characters is simplified in an often clumsy way.
I would say it's a great fun watch if you already love the manga and don't mind closing your eyes over the many flaws of the anime. But if you never read the manga, you shouldn't make the anime your introduction to VK, or you might dislike the series and its characters. It's far inferior to the manga. It's more of a very lovable bonus if you already like the manga, but it's nowhere as good.

Read the manga first, you'll enjoy the series as a whole and the anime in particular more than if you do it the other way around.

Also, the Vampire Knight fandom has so far taken rather badly the choice of Vic Mignogna to play Zero, because his voice and acting style are so different from the way Zero normally is in the original.
There was a video in which he voiced Zero for a convention, and it sparked outrage among the fans. Many feel that it's a completely different character when voiced by this actor.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's not a good actor, it's just that he insists on doing all characters his particular way rather than modifying his style to suit each series, and his style is not well suited for this character.
At least from the way he voiced him in the convention video, which was completely different from the character's personality. I can only hope that ever since that convention he might have reconsidered his approach of the character.

So the fans of Vic Mignogna are happy as the other reviewer is, but him playing Zero might not be the best choice for the series itself, because of his voice and style for him being so different from how the character normally is. (At least if things didn't change since the convention.)

If you are a fan of subtitled anime however, this shouldn't be a problem.",1275868800,5,1972,4.454293628808864

The animation is absolutely beautiful, the voices are great, and the writing is suberb. A lot of dialogue is taken straight from the manga with no change at all, to my suprise and pleasure. It even comes with a small excerpt from the first manga volume.

The only thing I didn't like doesn't affect me personally, but I could see it spoiling a surprise for newer fans. A while down the road, there are some plot twists that are meant to be pretty surprising by that point. One is the Headmaster's name and former occupation, which are directly stated. Another surprise is very strongly hinted at, though not out-and-out directly stated. Since I already knew both, it didn't bother me, but it was something I didn't care for.

The first two episodes were very slow, but started to give a little background information on two of the three main characters.  Granted, things did need to be explained, but there had to be a better way to do it.

Zero and Kaname are very interesting young men, however, if I had to listen to Yuki whine once more about this, that, or how much she owes Kaname I was going to strangle her.  She's so wishy-washy and needs to grow a backbone.  Her never-ending need for sympathy reminds of a saying out here...sympathy is in the dictionary between s**t and syphilis.

I honestly had no major issues with the English voices and was very happy that it was even offered in English. The best English (voices) match-ups were Zero, Cross, Aido and Seiren, while the weakest were Yuki (sounded very young) and Kaname but overall the English version was very good and the voice actors should only get better as they get more comfortable in their respective roles. There is always the option to watch the series in Japanese for those not happy with the English version/voices.",1280534400,,574,4.86734693877551

8424658,5,B004D2GMQW,I love the anime series itself. I really wish they had the subtitled version available on Prime and not the Dubbed. I've seen the Subbed version and although this version is decent the subtitled is better. I hope Amazon can make it available as an option.,1505174400,,255,4.565217391304348
