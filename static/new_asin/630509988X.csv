These movies are World Strongest, Dead Zone, and Tree of Might they are good if you are starting to collect the Movies this is a good start then move on with the other ones.... But if you do get these you will definately have to get the Lord Slug movie also that will then keep you updated on the movies... But like i said these aren't the best of the movies and if you are just looking for Super Saiyans these aren't tapes for you... I recomend Android through World Tournoment tapes if you want Super Saiyans....",998006400,5,766,4.217687074829932
