The strangest thing about ""Night of the Skull"" (""Night of the Assassins"", if you prefer) is that it's largely a by the numbers, calm redux of all those old dark house movies from the thirties and forties. You know, the ones where a girl stands to inherit a fortune and the all the loons in her family start trying to murder her (and everyone else, normally). For Franco, this movie seems downright conventional... Which is actually disappointing. Who wants to see Franco making calm, rational pieces of film?

Not I. I don't know about anyone else.

There are some minor bits that show Franco on the verge of trashing up everything and going Gonzo, but that glorious breakdown never occurs. There are hints of torture, incest, and other taboo subjects that never get explored. One cool moment has a man buried alive with only his bound hands sticking out of the ground--I LIKED that part!

Despite a distinct lack of Franco behavior, I'd still tell people to seek this out for a cheap price; it's little more than a footnote in the master's career, yet a footnote is worth exploring for fans. Don't expect much.",1405987200,2,1360,4.774468085106383
8093201,2,B000BVNS8Y,"the story is basically ""ten little indians"" in Spanish. It is OK but if subtitles are a turn off you might want to stay away, Franco has done much better, but you could do worse than this too. It is set in the middle ages and involves a will and a guy in a rubber mask who is killing of the heirs.",1142380800,2,297,3.806451612903226
