8539132,5,B004ZBFRIU,"Wow!  A newly discovered masterpiece by a virtually unknown composer!  That's what is presented in this live concert video of the huge (large orchestra, two mixed choruses, boy's choir, chamber choir, 5 vocal soloists, organ and off-stage brass) two-hour oratorio by Mahler and Strauss contemporary Rudolf Tobias.  Awash in quotations from Wagner and leit-motifs of its own, this work none-the-less has a youthful and gloriously original flavor.  The choral writing is Handel-like in its use of counterpoint and sheer vocal power.  And the richly chromatic music, composed at the cusp of late Romanticism, is ceaselessly beautiful.  Sadly the young composer never witnessed a good performance of his epic work and died just nine years later in 1918.

The performance conducted by Neeme Jarvi is heart felt, dynamic and flowing.  The tenor Juhan Tralla and baritone Rauno Elp sing with power, beauty and drama.  The filming is creatively directed to emphasize not only the complexity and grandeur of the work but also the many mysterious, meditative and intimate moods.  The biblical story of Jonah's reluctant mission to spread a compassionate morality to a heathen empire is brought to modern times by this turn-of-the-century masterpiece.  What a find!",1311206400,6,1254,5.346938775510204
