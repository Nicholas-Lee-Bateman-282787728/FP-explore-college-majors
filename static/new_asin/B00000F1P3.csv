This was one of my favorite episodes, because it showed Captain N in an adventure with Link and Zelda, which were my favorite video game characters at the time. Yes, it is dated nowadays, especially with CGI taking over convention animation, let alone the NES controller on Kevin's belt. But for anyone remembering when animation was clean and good, and likes a trip down memory lane, this is a good episode to have.

(I can only imagine what a modern version of Captain N would be like; a Wii controller on the belt maybe?)",1395100800,,668,4.661016949152542
