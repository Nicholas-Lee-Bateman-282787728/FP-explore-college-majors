2452572,5,B000C3L27A,"My 11 month old twins love this dvd. We had bought the first dvd ""My Baby Can Talk"" and were so impressed with it, we had to have this one too.  We were not disappointed.  This is the same high quality as the first and just as engaging.  I have tried a couple of other sign videos on the market and have only played them once.  But the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series gets played over and over.  We have only been practicing signing for about two months.  My little girl initiates three signs.  I am sure my son is not far behind.  It is exciting to have your child be able to tell you what he or she needs.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1134691200,3,631,3.984
2452573,5,B000C3L27A,"Danielle is 13 months old and loves to watch ""My Baby Can Talk"" DVD's.  As soon as she hears the intro music she runs to the TV and sits down to watch.  The first time she watched ""Sharing Signs"" she signed ball and cereal.  Now, every morning she signs for her cereal.

I love the way please and thank you are put in the DVD several times to reinforce good manners.  ""Sharing Signs"" is a wonderful addition to the first DVD ""First Signs"".  Even my older children are excited about the DVD's and enjoy watching it with Danielle.

I recommend these DVDs to all mothers with babies.  This is the perfect gift for new moms.  I feel it bridges the communication gap between mom and baby.  Danielle is my 5th child and signing has made the toddler experience even more rewarding because I understand what she wants and don't have to guess.  THANK YOU FOR THE PERFECT SIGNING DVD.",1133740800,3,874,4.433962264150943
2452574,5,B000C3L27A,"The first video taught my then twelve month old son to sign the very first time he watched it and the Sharing Signs DVD is just as amazing. He is now fifteen months old and is already signing please, thank you, help, baby and more after just a couple of viewings. Everyone who sees him signing is amazed by how well he can communicate and by how calm his ability to communicate has made him.  No other videos have been able to capture my son's interest like the My Baby Can Talk videos have. I recommend this series to every new mother I know!",1133568000,2,543,4.221153846153846
2452575,5,B000C3L27A,"My Baby Can Talk ""Sharing Signs"" is great!

My baby is 19 months old and loved it the first time I put it on for him. After watching the DVD only a few times he was already signing tree, diaper, giraffe and flower it is so exciting watching him learn. Thank you for making signing with my baby so fun and easy.

2452576,5,B000C3L27A,"KAEGAN IS NOW 18 MONTHS AND KNOWS ABOUT 20 SIGNS! HE'S LEARNING THEM MUCH QUICKER NOW THAT HE'S OLDER. THESE DVD'S WERE HIS FIRST INTRODUCTION TO SIGN LANGUAGE AND HE'S BEEN WATCHING THEM SINCE HE WAS 7 MONTHS OLD. HIS FIRST SIGN WAS ""MILK"" AT 11 MONTHS.

AFTER WATCHING Sharing Signs only THREE TIMES, KAEGAN DID THE FOLLOWING SIGNS:

 monkey, cereal, flower, baby, boat, apple, giraffe, airplane, shirt, diaper and cracker.

Kaegan is also learning to put the SIGNS into sentences! The other day he signed, ""more crackers please"" and it took me a minute to realize that he SIGNED AN ENTIRE SENTENCE! What an amazing bridge of communication!

AS A FORMER TEACHER, I LOVE HOW WORDS FROM THE FIRST DVD ARE INCORPORATED INTO VARIOUS AREAS OF THIS DVD TO REINFORCE WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY LEARNED. THE PACE IS EASY TO FOLLOW FOR A SMALL CHILD, AND THE IMAGES SHOW REAL OBJECTS, TOY OBJECTS AND IMAGINARY (LIKE PUPPETS) WHICH HELPS THE CHILD UNDERSTAND THAT THE OBJECTS COME IN MANY FORMS.

MY SON WAS ENGAGED THE ENTIRE TIME! HE LOVES THESE DVDS!

I'M A BIG SUPPORTER AND TELL EVERYONE! I couldn't ask for anything more engaging, educational and postive to help build my son's knowledge!  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! You're work is amazing!",1133568000,2,1247,4.767441860465116
2452581,5,B000C3L27A,"At first when I got the set as a gift didn't really think it would be at all interesting for my daughter who at the time was a newborn. Started putting on these DVD's for her when she was about 6 months, at least 3 times a week and from the beginning it captivated all of her attention. Now she's 20 months old and knows absolutely all the words from all three DVD's. I recommend these because they not only show signs of the words but the actual word and alot of pictures, videos and actual people in it. I wish there were more of these, would definitely buy.",1414454400,,560,4.146788990825688

2452583,5,B000C3L27A,"I hate telling parents to turn on a video and let it take care of your child .. but this one you can.  Great to do with the child .. but even as infant, toddler .. great way to teach them something & hear something (instructor's voice) that is positive.  Children are adorable in the video and it is so darn easy!  So much better than watching cartoons that give them nothing in return.",1408579200,,386,4.1891891891891895
2452584,5,B000C3L27A,"My girls (not deaf) were able to sign before 1 for ""mommy /help"" or ""more/ eat"". I nearly cried with pride. Early youngsters may not make it through the whole dvd at once (and they don't recommend that), but if parents watch it & learn (it's easy), with a little help by repeating key signs to them they will be communicating!",1407110400,,326,4.360655737704918

2452587,5,B000C3L27A,See my review of My Baby Can Talk - First Signs.  These are wonderful tools for babies/toddlers to learn to communicate when they are unable to yet talk.,1389225600,,153,4.464285714285714
2452588,5,B000C3L27A,"I bought this for my 4 year old grand-daughter who has non-verbal Autism. She loves watching it. She will hand the DVD to you to play it for her. She sits nicely and watches it closely. We don't know what goes on in the mind of a child with Autism and although she doesn't like signing, she does understand when we sign to her. We are hoping some day that she will start signing to us. It would be wonderful for her to be able to communicate with us.",1388448000,2,450,4.067415730337078

My kids didn't get really into the videos until after they were one (DVD suggests 10+ months) but now they love it. Easy to follow, fun graphics and music. Check the parent tutorials at the end, they have helpful suggestions and even more signs.",1367452800,,380,4.148648648648648
2452590,3,B000C3L27A,My daughter loves the my first words DVD in this series and she likes this one but hasn't learnt any signs from it yet. We will keep at it though. It's good to have for some variation.,1361404800,8,184,4.0
2452601,4,B000C3L27A,"This is a good series, but my son prefers the 'Baby Babble' series.  Overall, these dvd's have greatly imporved his desire to speak, his ability to communicate, and his overall happiness.  His inability to speak causes quite a bit of frustration.  Sign language greatly relieves this.",1356134400,,284,5.130434782608695
2452602,5,B000C3L27A,"Great product.  Really gets its point across with showing the kids how to sign. It's great that the toddler does it too, so it shows the parent how a child would do the sign.",1310947200,,174,4.117647058823529
2452603,4,B000C3L27A,"These Baby Hands videos are the only t.v. I let my daughter watch, and she has learned so much from them. However, I do not sit her idly in front of the t.v. - I watch it with her and sign with her, making further comments and instructions based off of what we see on screen. It helps to teach the signs quicker than we could learn them on our own.",1301356800,2,348,3.915492957746479
2452604,5,B000C3L27A,"My 24 month old son loves this video.  We have had the first one in the series for many months, and we finally decided to spend the money for this one.  He runs to the tv and screams ""monkey"" whenever he wants to watch it.  (The first sign in the video is for monkey.)  This video is fun and entertaining for him, and he also has learned MANY signs from it.  It's amazing how many signs he uses throughout the day, even when he hasn't watched the video in days.  Sign language is great because sometimes it's hard to tell exactly what he's saying, but the signs make it very clear.  The difference between baby, brown bear, and bubble from a very excited, running around toddler isn't always easy to distinguish; add a sign and it's much simpler.

I also have the first three Signing Times videos, and although I think they're great, my toddler has no interest in watching them.  My Baby Can Talk series has toys and animations that are more interesting to him.  Also, I like this series because it shows a baby/toddler doing the signs as well as the adult.  Figuring out signs from an adult is easy.  Toddler sign language is a bit more unique.

FWIW- My son has a speech delay and receives speech therapy once a week for it.  I'm absolutely sure that this video series has increased his vocabulary.  After watching this particular video just a few times, he started pointing at trees and saying ""TREE!"". Same thing happened with the words train, monkey, lion, cereal, thank you, please, apple, and boat.  He will do almost every sign along with the video but when he's just walking around and playing, he points to these objects and SAYS the words.  He will sign and say the word if he can, but often his hands are too busy holding, grabbing, pointing, etc. to use a sign.  I'm so excited that my son's vocabulary has increased so much!!!

I will be ordering the third video very soon.  I am very grateful for this video series.",1288396800,2,1930,4.46
2452605,5,B000C3L27A,"Highly recommend these.  My daughter has learned so many signs from these videos.  All of them in context, so she will only do the sign when she sees the object or thing or when she wants to communicate something.  I am SO impressed!  She has more signs than my friends babies who go to sign classes!",1285372800,,300,4.303571428571429
2452606,5,B000C3L27A,"My 15-month old daughter loves this video! We had been watching My Baby Can Talk-First Signs for a while, and we were both sick and tired of it! (Don't get me wrong, it's a great video, but we had been watching it for too long :-)). This new video caught my daughter's interest and attention immediately! She laughed and smiled throughout the video, and after watching it only once, she started signing for ""plane"". We've been watching it for a couple of weeks now, and she's already signing for at least 10 of the words presented there. I love the fact that there are so many different people in this video. In addition to the adorable little girl who demonstrates each sign, and who appears in the First Signs video, too, there's a cute little boy, three other babies and a few adults. This gives the video variety and is really fun to watch. It also teaches useful words such as ""daddy"" ""mommy"" ""diaper"" ""cracker"" and introduces the concepts of ""please"" and ""thank you"". All and all, a wonderful purchase. I highly recommend it!",1277078400,3,1031,4.608695652173913
2452607,5,B000C3L27A,"This is the third baby sign language DVD I bought for my 2-year old.  It does not have the slick animation that the others have, but it does not seem to need it.  Baby us glued to the screen whenever I show it, and started using the signs after the second viewing.  It has a lot more signs than other DVDs and both the segment for parents and the included booklet are full of even more signs.  This is really a learning resource!

I have seen the DVD at least a dozen times now, and I still like watching it.",1271548800,3,508,4.04
2452608,5,B000C3L27A,"My daughter is just turning 17 months and we have been using all 3 my baby can talk DVD's since she was 9 months old, she knows nearly every sign on all 3 dvd's and uses them in her daily life.  This is a fantastic tool and I could not imagine raising my daughter and not being able to communicate like we can with the signs she has learned.

When I first watched ""First Signs"" I thought give me a break, this is so lame.  But it shows what I know, my daughter loved it, it was like baby crack. At 9-10 months she would watch 25-35 minutes straight before she would loose attention.  To contrast we tried some of the Baby Einstein sign videos when she was around a year old. They are more glitzy and have the TV Actress Marlee Matlin signing. But my daughter didn't appreciate any of that production value, she barely paid any attention to them at all.

I tell everyone I know with infants about these DVD's and recommend them at the highest level.",1248652800,2,948,4.2444444444444445
2452609,5,B000C3L27A,"I just started having him watch educational videos while I cook. No other videos I have (elmo, Barney, wiggles, etc.) keep his attention like this one. I'm glad cause I much perfer a signing video to keep his attention than the others. He always giggles and looks at me during the monkey sign images at the beginning. He does it every time especially with the last monkey toy shown. We checked it out from the library and now I will buy it because I can always trust he'll watch it while I prepare food. And it's soooo engaging. I haven't seen the other ones. We watch it once a day almost. Yesterday my son was sick, so he was clingy when ever he was awake, but at least some of the day he was entertained by something other than me and some toys occasionally, so I could make something healthy to eat. I did read on other reviews that on another video in the series that some signs by the kids are not clear. Some in this one aren't either. I know babies won't be perfect at it, but at least the kids in an instructional video should be pretty close to it. It would bug me if my son signed weird because his imitating the kids, but we're not to that point yet. My son barely signs yet. We've only had the video for 2 weeks. I love the classical music, and how it is coordinated with actions of objects and people in the video. I personally like the close up on the pictures in on the shirts. Kids love the things on their shirts and to be silly about what they are wearing. You'd have to watch to know. Any misconception can be cleared up by me reinforcing the signs when I can, especially during the video, interacting with him during the video with objects we have, like a hat, stuffed monkey, diaper, cracker, etc.",1248220800,3,1719,4.259938837920489
2452610,5,B000C3L27A,"This is a nice educational DVD for a baby to watch, the genre being quite limited.  Also highly recommended is a music DVD entitled Trebellina.",1246060800,,143,4.72
2452631,5,B000C3L27A,"I ordered these CDs,all three in the series. I had misgivings at first,but ordered them any way. Was I ever surprised. They were for my year old grand daughter. She was totally captivated by them. She has learned to not only sign,but knows the words and their meaning. She is now 18 months old and has a very large vocabulary. All I have for these series,is praise and just wish there were more to follow,as she advances in age. Thank you for making these avaliable.",1242172800,3,466,4.4941176470588236

2452633,5,B000C3L27A,Before this video my 17 month old only knew around 3 words in sign language and a month later he is up to 7! Some he learned all on his own. This is a wonderful video that my son asks for over and over again. I deffinatly recommend it,1238976000,2,234,3.795918367346939
2452634,5,B000C3L27A,"My son LOVES this video.  He watches it over and over.  He is 17 months old and is using some of the signs.  Yesterday he combined two of the signs as he was crying to say ""eat please.""  The way it is presented is understandable and enjoyable for kids.  I started with the ""First Signs"" video and loved that one (it is the first in the series) so I bought this one too.  It's enjoyable to watch my son learn and for us to be able to communicate better with each other.  Recently he kept signing ""baby,""  he is our first and only child at the moment, maybe he is telling me he wants a brother or sister...",1236297600,2,604,4.059322033898305

2452636,5,B000C3L27A,"I found this video to be extremely helpful when my adopted son was diagnosed as being speech delayed at 9 months. He immediately was able to connect the words on the video with the signs that were being taught. More important, it assisted him in learning new words and how to speak them properly. I knew the sign language lessons with him were working when he was signing ""baby"" to me when he wanted his teddy bear who was immediately named ""baby bear"" forever. He used his new words that he learned in sign to ask for things he wanted like ""drink"" ""eat"" and ""ball"" with a signed ""please"" and ""thank you"". It gave him a sense of accomplishment and encouragement to learn more words through sign.",1221523200,2,695,4.480314960629921
2452637,5,B000C3L27A,We own the whole series and this one is definitely the best. You can tell the filmmakers learned from the other two. The transition between words and the pace is a lot better. They also teach 'please' and 'thank you' which is more useful than animal names. I love the addition of the girl signing the song at the end. My one minor complaint is gonna sound strange to those who haven't seen it but...those of you who have will agree. Do you remember when the monkey asks the giraffe for help to get the banana? He forgets to say thank you!,1217116800,3,538,4.284313725490196
2452638,5,B000C3L27A,I bought this and also the first DVD to teach my son baby sign language. It is a blessing! He learned quite quickly and so did I! Makes it so much easier to know what it is your baby wants!,1211846400,2,189,3.75

We don't mind letting her watch some television, as long as the content is educational and doesn't switch scenes too quickly.  This baby sign video has good music, cute puppets, good actors, good narration and good quality picture.  My daughter can't do the signs yet, but I'm sure she's learning and will show for it later.",1208044800,2,392,4.8059701492537314
2452640,5,B000C3L27A,"Part of an entertaining series (though ""exploring signs"" is less entertaining for my son to watch), well worth the investment.

I love the fact that they have children of various ages doing the signs also, so I can see the gamut of what to expect when my son is trying to sign.
Both this DVD and the first in the series are fun to watch and have taught me to sign. Watching them often reinforces the signs to my son.
I only wish that the producers would have organized all of the basic signs (Mommy, Daddy, please, thank you, eat, more , bath, etc) onto the first DVD instead of making us wait for the second one.",1205020800,,619,4.12396694214876
2452652,5,B000C3L27A,My 22 month old loves this video and picked up the signs very quickly! Her spoken vocabulary also improved as soon as we started using the signs. This is an engaging demonstration that toddlers really enjoy and can learn quickly!,1203206400,2,229,4.75
2452653,5,B000C3L27A,"My daughter (18 months now!) loves this series.  She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.
We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.
Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.
The only odd thing I've noticed is with the Mommy and Daddy signs.  These are hard concepts to get across in a video and my daughter has ended up thinking all women are called mommy and all men are daddy.  My husband and I are still DADDY and MOMMY however - note the captial letters - so I don't see it as a problem.  In time she will learn that the correct word for other women is WOMAN and the correct word for other men is MAN.",1203120000,2,953,4.266666666666667
2452654,5,B000C3L27A,"This is the second series that I purchase for my daughter.

It includes these signs: monkey, share, ball, balloon, lion, thank you, please, boat, airplane, giraffe, elephant, bath, sleep, cereal, diaper, help, hat, mommy, daddy, baby, shirt, socks, train, apple, flower, tree, etc (i don't remember the rest).

a little bit more complicated than the first dvd.  but it still works!  I still have waiting these words though: hurt, potty, stop, or wait.  since it is very useful!

i like also the last episode in this dvd when they ran the SOCK songs with all the signs.  I can learn how to sign other things like: black, white, day, night, brown, bear, pig, town, blue, red, purple, play, cool, hopping, land.

looking forward to watch the third dvd!

PS: my daughter starts to watch the first dvd in her 12 months old and we've been moving forward to the second dvd when she was 14 months.  Now she JUST turns 16 months and she is almost mastering both dvds!  that shows that small children is a fast learner!",1198713600,2,1009,4.612359550561798

My 18 month old child is engaged, entertained, and she learns quickly from these videos.  It is also aimed at a young audience where as Signing Times, for example, seems to be meant more for kids that already know the words.  Of the three videos, this one is the toughest because they have chosen words that are a little tougher for children to grasp as they include concepts like sharing and help instead of the signs all being nouns.  They have still managed to present the words and signs in ways that my child grasped very quickly and unlike the baby einstein videos (which includes words like window) these signs are signs my baby USES!  She says and signs ""help please"" most of the time when she wants something which is much nicer to hear than a bunch of fussing.  This video includes signs for airplane, all done, apple, baby, ball, balloon, mommy, monkey, please, share, shirt, sleep, bath, boat, cereal, cracker, daddy, diaper, elephant, giraffe, flower, hat, help, and lion.  We bought this at the same time as exploring signs and her vocabulary has grown exponentially since purchasing the two.  I was amazed that after watching the video once she said and signed ""balloon please"" the next day when she saw another child with one.",1197676800,3,1360,4.680672268907563
2452657,5,B000C3L27A,"We have at least 10 real signs learned by watching this and the other series.  These are real signs and not random baby language signs... if you don't baby talk to your children, don't baby sign to them either!",1195603200,,210,4.384615384615385
2452658,4,B000C3L27A,"Although my baby loves this video (and I actually do, too) for reasons already stated by other reviewers, it does contain what I consider to be errors in judgment that bug me every time we watch it.  For example, it spends barely 40 seconds on ""Mommy"", but well over 2 minutes on ""airplane!"" (grrr)  The ""airplane"" segment doesn't even include an experience that a baby is most likely to relate to:  a shot of a jet flying high overhead.  Then there is the confusing ""shirt"" segment, which focuses on the graphic print on each shirt instead of the shirts themselves.  The video immediately cuts to closeups of the print which don't even show the neck and sleeves of the shirt, so all that is in frame, for example, is a cartoon of a cow in a truck.  To make it more confusing, a rhyme is recited along with visual and sound effects - all about the cow instead of the shirt that it's printed on!  The images don't make it obvious what word is being taught even to an adult, much less to a baby.  The ""share"" segment has an unclear shot in which a child's hand separates a pile of jellybeans into two, but doesn't show any other person's hands, making it look like it's teaching the idea ""separate"" or ""divide"" instead of ""share.""  Although a voiceover of a child says, ""One for you, one for me,"" if the audience is supposed to be preverbal babies, then it doesn't help!  Finally, for some reason, the last phrase ""all done"" includes one shot in which the hands of the little boy signing are out of frame!  Hello - it's a sign language video!  To be fair, there are several shots in each segment, and the other shots chosen are usually a bit clearer in meaning than the ones I've described.  (Except for the  entire ""help"" segment, which illustrates the concept of ""someone else can do a task for me"" instead of ""give me a hand 'cause I can't do it all by myself."")  Still, the rest of this video is excellent, and I love this series for the way it captivates my daughter and has made her more interested in signing than by merely watching me sign.  I just hope the next installment due Oct. 15 '07 turns out to be more like the First Signs video, which was more focused and clear than this one.",1192147200,3,2193,4.364532019704433

The boys became very adept at those signs and LOVED the video. We don't watch it nearly as often now that the boys are approaching two years of age. However, just last week, one of them saw a butterfly, but was unable to form the word, so he used the sign and got REALLY excited. It's been such a blessing to have them able to communicate using both words and signs.",1189209600,,521,4.1683168316831685

So, I bought the second DVD, ""Sharing Signs,"" and a week after we started watching it, my daughter started using the new signs. Now, it's a part of our morning routine. I sign with the video and use the signs throughout the day. Now, she is 14 months old and she can sign about 20 words and she recognizes much more than that. She has even memorized the order of the signs so she will sign the next word right before it appears. Spooky, but she doesn't fuss as much as other non-signing babies and her grandparents get a kick out of getting her to sign at parties.

Sometimes I watch it with him, other times I put it in and he becomes so engrossed in it that I can actually get a few things done! He isn't much of a tv watcher, but this dvd holds his attention from the time I push play. The dvd shows an item (monkey, for instance)with a voice saying monkey, shows a woman signing monkey with a voice saying monkey, and shows numerous toy and real monkeys, a baby signing monkey, again shows a woman signing monkey with a voice saying monkey, and shows one more monkey before going on to the next word. This dvd has the signs for monkey, diaper, cracker, cereal, baby, sleep, mommy, daddy, please, thank you, tree, bath, socks, and several more. I'm just writing this down from memory, so my list may not be completely accurate. I'm mostly interested in my son learning words so that I can understand when he is hungry or thirsty, between this dvd and the ""My Baby Can Talk - First Signs"" dvd, my son is learning most of what I consider the most useful signs.",1179187200,3,1174,4.316742081447964

2452675,5,B000C3L27A,"My daughter get drawn in with both the music and the video.  I love that the video shows the word in many different settings.  For example, for 'monkey', the woman gives the sign for monkey, then you see monkey stuffed animals dancing around on the screen, then it shows clips of real monkeys, and a child signing 'monkey', toy monkeys, and finally the woman repeats the sign one last time.  I think it give great, realistic associations for the child.  I wish the woman doing the signs was a little more enthusiastic, but as a whole, I like this better than 'Signing Times'.",1174521600,3,575,4.553398058252427
2452676,5,B000C3L27A,"I am a speech therapist, and I thnk this is a terrific, well-filmed, quality video.  It is great for receptive vocabulary whether or not you much care about learning to sign! :)  It has lots of repetition with REAL videos and pictures of the objects (not cartoons) and great music.  It has just the right pacing to keep children excited and a nice, slow modeling of the signs with LOTS of verbal repetition of the vocabulary. My daughter loves these.

Now, my 2-year-old daughter is on the autism spectrum and did not understand how to imitate.  For parents trying to help their children learn to sign, a big ""tool"" that I feel is ""left out"" of lots of videos is ""HOW"" to teach your child to sign if they don't seem to be learning from just watching.  For young children, or children who cannot easily imitate, try ""hand over hand"" learning.  Pick an object your child can ""receive"" once he learns a sign. A small cracker works great for the ""eat"" sign.  During a snacktime when he is NOT starving, take your child's hands and make the sign for ""eat"" to his mouth. Then, immediately give him a piece of the cracker. Do this over and over again with repetition and SMALL bits of cracker (so he doesn't get too full).  Watch that you don't wait too long on giving him the cracker or he will not learn that the sign is a part of things and he will get frustrated! :)
Now, after 10 or so repetitions, try to just hold his arm and guide his hand to his mouth to help him make the sign.  After a number of more reps, try and just barely TOUCH his arm.  You are gradually fading the amount of help you need to help him learn the sign.  Eventually, he will go to make the sign himself. You may have to jump in and help again in a new session until he can remember the sign.  This may take several days or week sessions depending on how old your child is.  Be patient and try this at snack time everyday.  You may be surprised how fast it happens!
You can also do this same thing with other signs once he gets the hang of things.  Just be sure to FIRST choose signs that your child can receive reinforcment for.  So, pick a sign like ""book"" where you can read to him right after he signs..or ""go"" where you give him a push in the grocery cart as soon as he signs. Use your child's interests as guides.  Pick a sign that is relative to what HE is interested in...favorite toys or foods work great. Signs like ""cat"" aren't too helpful in the beginning, because what do you ""get"" if you sign cat?  What can you give your child as reinforcement for that?  Pick signs that he can use to request his needs.  These work best for helping him understand that language can ""get him something"" and therefore ""means something"".
Finally, a young child (4 or younger) won't be easily able to imitate very detailed signs.  You may have to modify the sign to teach it.  And that is just fine! The point is not that the child can make the sign 100% correctly as it relates to American Sign Language. The REAL point is that the sign means something and that it consistently stands for that language concept. For example, for my daughter, she couldn't sign ""go"" which is circling your hands within each other.  So, for ""go"" she simply raises her arm.  We use it in the shopping cart at the grocery store, in the car at red lights, in the swing at the park, etc.  It was her ""first sign"" and it helped her communicate purposefully and have a ""role"" in her independence. As she got the hang of it and got a bit older, I was able to teach the sign for ""swing"" instead of just ""go"".  But in the beginning, a sign that can lead to a wanted action is very powerful for a child.  Good luck and feel free to write if you'd like some helpful ideas!

My daughter loved it so much I forgot to return it on time and Blockbuster charged me!  I had already order the copy from amazon so now we have two!  My daughter has not only learned to sign all the words on the DVD, but it has given her the confidence to say them out loud, since she had the additional tool of the sign to let us know what she is trying to say.

She is 22 months now and starting to potty train.  A few weeks ago one her daycare teachers came to me (i work in the office) and said what does this mean? (while doing the sign for diaper).  I told her it was diaper and that my daughter probably wanted to be changed.  It is so neat to actually be able to understand your toddler!

We limit her television viewing but every day she wants her one video to be ""monkey"" as she calls My Baby Can Talk-Sharing Signs.  Its really helped her learn signs and to speak verbally.",1169856000,2,1016,4.065326633165829

The classical music is very soothing and engrossing. The signs are presented by a variety of people and characters, including children.

One of the sweetest things about this video are the photographs of cool and unique toys. They really did a job of bringing visual interest to this. The kids I work with like it a lot, as do I.

One excellent thing they do is re-introduce items later in the video as they're presenting new signs. They don't hit you over the head with it and say ""remember, this is a monkey?"". They just slip these things in, and for the child there is a flash of recognition and a chance to practice a sign they just learned minutes ago.

My criticism is that I would group the signs from these two videos differently than they did. More ""getting my needs met"" signs like ""more,"" ""all done"" and ""stop"" should be in the First Signs version, and more action words in Sharing Signs. And in general, I'd just like to see a little more vocabulary. But I suppose to do that, they would have had to sacrifice something in their relaxed presentation.

I have video of him watching the DVD for the first time & it's amazing how it totally captured his attention. He actually began signing (""more"") at 9 months & his daddy & I were so thrilled!

In early April I got the 2nd DVD, ""Sharing Signs"" & Max took to it again immediately. He began signing many of the new words that same day. To my surprise it only took two days for him to understand ""help"" which I was amazed at since it's a concept & not something I could easily point to (like a tree). Max knows about 35 signs now (for example, in addition to the very helpful ""more"", there's eat, milk, drink, cereal, dog, cat, bird, ball, go, car...) - he's so proud to be able to communicate with us & we love it!

Max is now 20 months old and has started talking.  I believe the DVDs have helped immensely.  Most of the time the word he's trying to say doesn't come out quite right so it's hard to understand.  But when he does the sign along with speaking then we know exactly what he's trying to say and can work with him on pronunciation!

2452694,5,B000C3L27A,"This DVD and the first My Baby Can Talk DVD are the very best media I have found for my daughter.  We started watching the First Signs DVD when she was 5 months old. During that month she started to sign ""dog"" (we have one and use the sign).  At seven months old she started to say (speaking) ""dog"" and ""duck"". By age one, the second DVD had come out and she had a signing vocabulary of about 50 signs and a speaking vocabulary approaching 100 words which astounded her pediatrician.  A couple of months later her vocabulary is just too big to count.  I am sure that watching these DVDs was instrumental in her early language development. We enjoy signing with our daughter but these DVDs are great for the spoken language development alone. However, when your child does start to speak, it is great to have him signing also because one can't always understand a child's pronunciation but it is easy to know what he is communicating from the signing.

My daughter prefers these to Baby Einstein, which she also likes, and always smiles when the music starts. The founder of the company said when speaking to my mothers club that they tested the footage with focus groups of babies to make sure that they captured babies' interest. It shows. They were engaging to her from the start and at nearly 20 months she still loves them.  These two DVDs are the favorites of my husband and I also.

I particularly like the use of ""please"" and ""thank you"" in the Sharing Signs DVD.  Although my husband and I say these words to our daughter frequently, we don't sign them very much. But our daughter does.  I am sure that her frequent use of ""thank you"", which she both signs and says was learned from the DVD. Sharing is a tough concept for a child her age but I am sure its use in the DVD will help her catch on early.

I appreciate the inclusion of the foods in this DVD because when transitioning to solid foods it is so helpful to be able to communicate with your child about what he wants to eat. I hope that future DVDs from Little Hands Productions will include more healthy baby and toddler foods.

These DVDs are my favorite baby shower gift now and I eagerly await future releases from Little Hands Productions. I have checked out many other signing videos/DVDs from the library.  These have a much higher production quality than most of the others, are much better and more engaging for infants and toddlers and, as nearly as I can tell, the signs are true ASL signs not made up.

For parents who enjoy these DVDs I recommend books from the Early Sign Language series which our daughter enjoys (kids love the photos of other kids) and helped us to learn more signs.",1148860800,4,2666,4.460905349794238

2452700,5,B000C3L27A,"I just had to take time to tell you about these products. We bought them just under 3 weeks ago. We have watched these with our 13-month-old son once or twice (since we have both in the series) a day since they arrived. On the second day my son used the sign for ""shoes."" We were stunned. Now he's up to at least 20 signs and adding new ones every day. The crowning moment came when there was no drink around (to make him think about it) but he signed ""drink"" to tell us he was thirsty. I couldn't get to the kitchen fast enough to reward his thirst and his effort. Now if he hadn't known the sign he might have just whined and forgotten about it or continued on for a bit, but there would have been no way that I could have known that he had a drink of water on his mind without some trial and error.

Let me say a few words about readiness. Because not all children this young may be developmentally ready to progress that quickly. We bought these videos because our son had already made up his own two signs to communicate with us so I figured he was primed and ready and we didn't want to miss an opportunity. I will say, however, that I believe any young child could benefit from watching these as they are excellent vocabulary builders and certainly children will progress at their own speed.

Regarding the format of the videos, they resemble the Baby Einstein series in the way that they present classical music along with several varied images of one item. The difference here (which I think is paramount) is that these videos sprinkle the images with images of an adult and some children demonstrating the sign for you and speaking the word. This seems to work great. We have all the Baby Einstein videos and I must confess that these two signing videos are superior and I wish there were more.

ADDED 12/2008 We've had another son since I published this review.  He's now 18 months old and has had the same response to these two videos as his older brother (who's now almost 4).  He ADORES these two videos and communicates almost every need to us through sign language.

I started teaching signing early (8 months) with the ""baby signs"" video (which I also recommend), and then progressed to this DVD. Its more entertaining than baby babble and teaches language and signing better than baby einstein.

I think its fantastic and want to buy more.",1144022400,4,497,4.712643678160919
2452702,5,B000C3L27A,We're looking forward to the next volume.  My 18-month-old son is already signing some of the words from the DVD...just after a couple months.  My husband and I have learned all the signs on it too.,1142726400,3,198,4.472222222222222
2452713,5,B000C3L27A,"I own this DVD & the original ""My Baby Can Talk"" (in the series).  My daughter started watching them at 10 months old and within 4 weeks she knew her 1st sign.  From there things progressed rapidly.  She is now 16 months old and knows 30 signs and can speak 35 words.

It's true that the videos are not as ""polished"" as the Einstein videos... but they are MUCH better at teaching the art of sign language.  The purpose isn't for your child to sit there, mesmerized by the images on the screen for 30 minutes.  You & your child are supposed to see the action/image and then see the ""sign"" for it.  Then your job as the caregiver is to repeat these ""signs"" throughout the day as you interact with your child; that's how your child is going to learn sign-language.

As suggested on the video, my routine was to put the DVD on once a day (at the same time each day), about 4 times per week. Sometimes my daughter sat through the entire video, sometimes she didn't.  But she learned the signs from ME using them each and every day during our normal activites.

I honestly believe that through the constant repetition of saying the word and then showing the sign for it, that's what helped my child not only learn sign-language but learn verbal communication so rapidly at this stage.  I highly recommend these DVD's!",1142294400,4,1311,4.443514644351464
2452714,5,B000C3L27A,"My 18 month old daughter LOVES to watch this video. She even learned several signs from it that I hadn't taught her yet. She can do about 30 different signs now, that she learned from this and the last video, ""First Signs"", and is a very happy, contented baby. Instead of crying when she wants something, she gets my attention by saying 'pee' ('please'), then signs what she wants.

She also has learned to speak a number of words from the video, and now combines words and signs to communicate. I have noticed as her verbal volcabulary grows, she chooses it over signing, which shows that signing does not stunt the baby's use of verbal language, as I have heard suggested by some.

This video is a very pleasing mix of music, sights, sounds, animals and children. Very creative and well done.  I did notice a lot of the same music fromt the first video on this one.  Though a different selection would have been nice, it is pleasant enough to listen to.  I highly reccommend it!",1141948800,6,980,4.5141242937853105
2452715,5,B000C3L27A,"I am a marriage, family, child counselor and work with families with preverbal babies.  I highly recommend the My Baby Can Talk series to all my clients with babies to help reduce frustration and enhance the child-parent bond.  This series makes learning sign language simple and my clients are amazed at how quickly their young babies learn to sign and speak as well!

The images and music are carefully crafted to engage young babies and hold their attention.  Parents also have the opportunity to see preverbal babies signing all the words presented.  In addition, babies learn to combine signs and words such as ""apple, please.""

I have had the opportunity to review other sign language videos and find this one to be the most appropriate for babies as well as the most engaging.  This is the only sign language series that I recommend.",1141603200,4,840,4.8321678321678325
2452716,5,B000C3L27A,"I love both videos of the My Baby Can Talk series.  We bought the first video when our daughter was 10 months old and started showing signs of frustration because she could not communicate her needs.  We had heard that sign language was a great tool for babies and toddlers to communicate - definitely the truth! We bought the second video as soon as it was available.  Our daughter,now 2, signs over 50 words!  It has bridged the gap for communication and it is so much fun!!  We also think that the sign language has even encouraged her to talk more than most children her age.

I have bought atleast 10 of these videos!  They are one of my favorite baby gifts to give!

I recommend this video series to all parents with children between 10 months and 4 years of age.",1141516800,3,769,4.366197183098592
2452717,5,B000C3L27A,"Our baby learned to sign through these DVDs, so we love them. This DVD covers signs which are more abstract than the first one (ie...please, thank-you, share) so it is better used after you've really worn out the first!",1140912000,5,219,4.641025641025641

It's great to be able to communicate with him.  We found the model to be a little off-putting, but her signing is clear and our little guy can understand.  The DVD employs generalization, which helps teach each sign as a concept, and places it in context.  The music is hinky, but works somehow.  In any case, despite production flaws, the structure and design of these DVDs is solid and works.",1140652800,3,542,4.546391752577319
2452719,5,B000C3L27A,"I am amazed at how quickly she has picked up and starting using the signs.  It is so exciting to see your little one communicate well before she can talk!

What I like most about the My Baby Can Talk videos is that the baby sees multiple representations of the word for which the sign is being taught.  For example, for 'monkey', you see real monkeys, toy monkeys, stuffed animal monkeys.  Not only did my daughter learn the sign for monkey, she now recognizes other monkeys in her toys, books, etc.",1139011200,4,499,4.450549450549451

I hope you continue to make more.",1138752000,3,331,3.8115942028985508
2452721,5,B000C3L27A,My 18th month old loves this video more than any video she has.  When I put it in and hit play and the sound comes on she immediately starts making the monkey sound and sign. Not only has she learned signs it has increased her vocabulary a great deal. We love these videos and only wish there was more.,1138665600,2,302,4.11864406779661
2452722,4,B000C3L27A,"Thank you for teaching more important signs, such as ""please"", ""thank you"", ""mommy"", ""daddy""! This was a terrific addition that the initial video didn't have. Great idea!

I think my little one still prefers the first video, but this one still rates well with her too.

In my opinion, it seems individual focus on the sign is to short. This video needs a ""repeat play"" option on the menu to really get the signs down well. I really liked the ""socks"" song she signs at the end.",1138320000,2,476,4.459770114942529
2452723,5,B000C3L27A,"A must for your children. These videos helped teach my 15 month old, not only sign, but how to say the words. I also was having a hard time teaching simple manners to her, however, after she watched the video several times she begain to understand what I was trying to teach her. She is now saying and signing ""please"" and ""thank you."" Great educational dvds.",1137888000,4,359,4.454545454545454

I have a nephew Luke that has learned many of the signs from My Baby Can Talk - First Signs.  (My wife watches him 5 days a week.)  He loved to watch it every day but seemed to be loosing interest in it lately bacause he had learned most of the signs.

This new title My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs is just what we needed!  He is eagerly watching and learning the new signs.  It is such a joy to watch the frustration disappear from his face when he realizes that he is able to communicate with us!",1137628800,3,573,4.071428571428571
2452725,5,B000C3L27A,"I am a professional linguist and am familiar with the recent neurological studies indicating strong evidence that the underlying neurological structures for signed and spoken language are co-located. I am also the grandfather of two young grandchildren who have been raised on the superb My Baby Can Talk dvd series.

When these two children began to speak - having already spent a year communicating with success using the ASL signs that they got from the My Baby Can Talk series plus additional signs avaiable on the website associated with this DVD series - they broke the pattern of classic Psycholingistic reserch for the acquisition of spoken language in an amazing way.

The classic models for spoken language acquisition dictates that the child will begin with the single work naming function and progress to two work utternances, then three word utterances and continue until they are forming phrases, sentences, etc.

My obsrvations (sample limited to two children) are that a child who masters a portion of ASL in addition to displaying all the advantages already catalogued (larger vocabulary, less frustration, higher tested IQ scores,..) will skip the one/two/three word development stages and begin with phrases - beginning at an advanced stage of spoken language acquisition. It is as if the child already has mastered the naming function and and the pattern of stringing symbols together in phrasal units and moves to phrasal utterances directly without the need to pass through these stages.

Thus, the short term consequenes of a baby learning to sign are a significant acceleration or the language acquisition function and offers strong antedotal evidence congruent with the neurological studies that signed and spoken language occurs in the same neurological structures receives strong observationsl support. The short term consequences are a serious acceleration of acquisition and mastery of language - what the long term consequences will be are startling to consider - I await with enthusiasm the longer term consequences of this work. Many thanks for an enormous contribution, to the people who made this possible through the My Baby Can Talk series!",1137542400,4,2176,5.316860465116279
2452726,4,B000C3L27A,"I would give it 4.5 stars if there is an option.

5 stars for teaching more communicative signs, such as ""please"", ""thank you"", ""mommy"", ""daddy"", ""all done"" and more daily use words ""diaper"", ""bath"" etc, compared to First Sign's object oriented words such as ""horse"", ""cow""; good attempt in reviewing the signs learned in the first DVD.

4 stars for the following:

Classical music segments are shortor with faster tempo, but less articulated, making it feel rushed. This coupled with more frequent non-sequential video clips giving a general busy feeling. The signs are less pronounced as a result. The rhymes have lost its creativity as well.

My son lost interest after 20 minutes into it and asked for ""Baby Einstein"". I have to watch the later half on my own. I think that tells somethings.

By the way, although both My Baby Can Talk DVDs have some clean fun, they do not have the humor many of the Baby Einstein DVDs have.",1137024000,18,929,4.709876543209877

2452728,5,B000C3L27A,"This is a great follow up video for the first.  I would reccommend that your child know how to do the first video's content in signing as the second video is more difficult with its concepts.

However my daughter still loves to watch it I showed it to a 2 year old cousin and he immediately started picking up the ideas of please and thank you and baby from this video.  He loved learning baby, monkey, mommy and daddy.  He just squealed with delight and ran around the house showing his mother over and over again that he could sign her now.

He learned the entirity of the first video when he was about 18 months old and has been practicing that ever since.

anyone who says any different doesn't understand that the concept of this video is obviously harder to teach and i think they do an excellent idea of trying to teach children some very useful words.",1136764800,,859,4.371069182389937
2452729,5,B000C3L27A,"I bought this DVD as soon as it was available, as we used the first DVD in this series ""My Baby Can Talk-First Signs.""  Caitlin was about 14 months when she saw the Sharing Signs DVD, and made the sign for diaper the next day after viewing the DVD.

My husband thought I was nuts, trying to teach Caitlin sign language, but he is a believer now.  We showed her the first video a few times a week starting at around 9 months, and she made her first sign around 11 or 12 months.  She has not learned ALL of the signs on these videos yet.  She tends to make the signs that mean the most to her, like book, milk, diaper, baby, and hat.  It is so cute to see her sign, and she is happy when we praise her.  Right now she is labelling things rather than asking for them with signs, most of the time, but she made the sign for book the other day and headed off to her bedroom to get out her books for me to read to her.  I don't think she is making genius progress with the signs, but she is learning words, and what things are, which is really neat and will give her a leg up, I think.  Even if you are not interested in the signs, the videos show the word on the screen, say the word, show the sign, and then show lots of examples of that word.  Caitlin just loooooves to watch these videos, and an added bonus is that she will eat almost anything while they are on.  We really have enjoyed learning sign language with her, and I think it has been a useful communication tool.  We are so tickled when she does a new sign.  She is about 15 months now, and did the signs for lion and monkey for the first time today.  Yay, Caitlin !",1136678400,4,1625,3.9907120743034055
2452730,5,B000C3L27A,"This video is an amazing compliment to their first, ""First Signs.""  I would highly recommend them both.  My daughter started watching ""First Signs"" when she was 3 months old.  Watching it captivated her.  At around 6 months she started getting really excited whenever I would get the DVD out.  At around 10 months she started signing!  When this DVD, ""Sharing Signs"" came out I purchases it immediately.  She loves this one just as much, and is able to sign most of the signs.  Through the sign language that she learned on these DVDs Tayah is able to communicate her needs.  It is amazing that she can sign help when she needs it rather than fuss and cry.

It moves very quickly, they spend little time reinforcing the meaning of the sign - blink and they've moved on. They barely show the actual signs. A new child is featured whose signing motions are very off base, he does not belong in an instructional DVD.
