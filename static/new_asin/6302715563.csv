The only standout matches on this program were Bret vs. Yokozuna and Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka and they both had horrible endings especially Bret's where Hulk Hogan's ego pretty much made this Wrestlemania that much worse.  A good key thing for this Wrestlemania was the debut of Jim Ross.

498812,3,6302715563,"A lot of people are quick to label this WrestleMania as the worst WrestleMania ever. I can sort of see why. Held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, NV, there were a lot of dud matches, and I would say three (maybe four) watchable matches.

For the Intercontinental Championship: Shawn Michaels (champion) vs Tatanka- Awesome opening title match. Not so awesome finish. You gotta hate those count outs.

The Headshrinkers vs The Steiner Brothers- Another great match featuring two tremendous tag teams. If you haven't seen early Steiners, this is a good match.

(Now is where the PPV starts going downhill)

Crush vs Doink the Clown- Boring match. Ends with the ""illusion"" (as said by Bobby Heenan) of two Doinks. They both attack Crush and the second Doink hides under the ring. Ref counts 3, Doink wins.

Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund- Short match, Ramon wins with a cradle.

For the Tag Team Championship: Money Inc. (champions) vs Hulk Hogan and Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake- It was an o.k. match, nothing special. Money Inc. wins by DQ.

""The Narcissist"" Lex Luger vs Mr. Perfect- This is the last watchable match (in my opinion). Solid wrestling throughout, Luger wins it with a backslide. Perfect got his leg on the rope, but the referee did not see it.

Giant Gonzalez vs The Undertaker- No comment. It is my personal belief that even diehard Undertaker fans would not even be able to watch this terrible excuse for a match. Fast forward at all costs.

For the World Championship: Bret ""Hitman"" Hart (champion) vs Yokozuna- Not a good match by Hitman's standards. He gets the sharpshooter locked on, but Mr. Fuji throws salt in Hart's eyes and Yokozuna covers him and becomes new champion.

For the World Championship: Yokozuna (champion) vs Hulk Hogan- That is correct. A second World Championship match right after the first one. Yokozuna challenges Hulk to a match, and in a very (very) short match, Hogan drops the leg on Yokozuna and becomes the new champion. The crowd at Caesars Palace erupts. I thought it was kind of interesting that this WrestleMania had 3 different men hold the Championship in the same night.

Overall, a lot of dud matches as you can see, but the key matches to look out for are the Intercontinental championship, The Headshrinkers/Steiners match, Luger/Mr. Perfect, and maybe the Tag Team Championship match. Some great and comical commentary by ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, and Jim Ross. That's really all folks.",1126742400,,2469,4.882775119617225
498813,5,6302715563,"The problem with this card and the reason people knock the event is because there isn't one standout match. There are however, a cluster of decent-to-solid matches that WrestleMania IX has to offer.

Before I give a rundown of the matches, let me start off by saying that WrestleMania IX had the best atmosphere of any WrestleMania, period. The gilts and glamour of the event, the spectacle of the outdoors Caesars Palace and Roman theme, sets a great stage and does a great deal to help the event. This is one of the reasons why I personally hold WrestleMania IX as one of my all time favorites. Well... that, and I was there : )

1) Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka - **3/4
(It's a decent opener, but it doesn't seem to flow. Very lame ending, Tatanka should have went over.)

2) Doink The Clown vs. Crush - *
(Even though it's 1 star in terms of quality, it's actually pretty entertaining.)

3) Steiner Brothers vs. Head Skrinker's - **2/4
(Solid tag match, but Money Inc. vs. the Steiner's would have been much better)

Bob Backlund vs. Razor Ramon - *
(Backlund was a big star in his day, but this is a squash match to make Razor look good. Throw away match.)

4) Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect - ***
(Let me start off by saying, that Luger's entrance here is one of the best in Mania history.
Good carry job by Perfect, who still had a serious lingering back injury that kept him out of action for 2 years at that point. Luger`s character at that point, the Narcissist, was very entertaining IMO. I loved the supposed metal plate that he had in his elbow, that he would use to knock people out with. They build up that move as deadly, and they do a good job of playing off of that at WrestleMania IX.)

Mega Maniacs vs. Money Inc. - *
(The Million Dollar man and IRS were good wrestlers, but this match is designed to make Hogan look good at the expense of everyone. Everyone involved were physically past their prime at this point anyway, and Hogan was always a horrible wrestler and wasn't nearly as over with the fans as he used to be.)

Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzalez - 
(I'm not going to waste my time on this one. The only thing good about this is Takers awesome entrance. The one thing that this show did offer was great entrances, lol.)

WWF Champion Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs. Yokozuna - ***2/4
(Suprisingly, this turned out to be the best match of the night. Bret does a good job of creating a realistic and entertaining match that the crowd was really into. Bret makes it seem like he has no chance and hell, but he ends up making the big comeback and locking Yoko in the sharpshooter. *this is legit* Hulk Hogan refused to work the show if he didn't win the title, and Bret's reign as champion came to and end. Yoko won the belt to have the heel transition the title over to the baby face Hogan.

At the time, this finish was exciting, but never made any sense. The plan was to have Hogan and Bret square off at Summerslam, but Hogan being the egomaniac that he is, refused to put Bret over, so the finish is the most illogical in WrestleMania history.)

Overall, WrestleMania IX isn't the best in terms of match quality, but it has such a classic/nostalgic feel that I personally love. It was a good, wholesome show that was safe for your kids to watch or the family to watch together, unlike today.",1126051200,6,3302,4.377450980392157

498815,1,6302715563,"When the highlight of a wrestlemania turns out to be Shawn Michaels versus Tatanka, you know it was a bad night.

Every thing surrounding it was cool. Caesar's Palace- great hotel. I like the idea of an outdoor setting for wrestling. JR's first PPV, but overlaps with Macho Man and Bobby Heenan. Pomp and ceremony was a change.

Then there's the matches.

Shawn versus Tatanka was a good opener maybe a 3 1/2 *s. probably the best match of the night.  Both these guys get in some pretty good moves Michales plays the heel as well as anyone and Tatanka clearly had some talent.

Undertaker versus Giant Gonzales - 1 * Oh my ! Oh my ! Even the taker couldn't pull a good one out of this pile.

Doink the... yeah whatever, 1 * and that's generous

Headshirkers versus Steiner's - 2 cool teams one bad match. 2*

Mr. Perfect vs. lex Luger- As another reviewer mentioned, surely Perfect can save the day. He put in a good effort but not enogh to rescue this PPV. 3 maybe 3 1/2 *'s

Money Inc. Vs. Hulk Hogan and Beefcake - requires no explanation other than that two guys celebrate and pose for 5 minutes after a stunning...disqualification. 2 *

Bret Hart versus Yokozuna. Actually this match was pretty good, maybe it's a tie with the Michaels-Tatanka match 3 and 1/2. Bret puts in a great effort and the ending is kind of cool. A heel has to get the belt at some point and cheating always fits the bill. And hey it ushers in the new generation right. Bret put out a great effort, Yokozuna puts in probably the best effort any huge guy has ever put in (with the possible exception of Bundy in Wrestlemani2). WWF is moving on.... Wait what's that...

Do you hear something....

""When it comes crashing down and it hurts inside""...

Bret needs assistance, but don't send a doctor or a trainer or even an official, send the Hulkster, afterall when he's not wrestling he MOONLIGHTS as a medic. And how does he help Bret by accepting a challenge from Mr. Fuji to take on the 9 minute reigning champion. A big Wrestlemania requires a BIG FINISH, the kind only a boot-leg drop can give.

498847,1,6302715563,"This is not even worthy of a review.
The only match is always wanted to see was Bret Hitman Hart vs Ultimate Warrior, and I really hoped in late 92, with the way things were going that a match was on the horizon.
Warrior was the number one contender at Summerlslam 1992, and was robbed of the title, and then Bret won it a few weeks later.
I would've settled for Hulk Hogan vs Bret Hart and Warrior vs Ric Flair. But in the end we were given a pile of crap.
Everymatch sucks. And just when you think it can't suck anymore Hulk Hogan wins the title

498848,1,6302715563,"This is without question one of the worst cards ever assembled for a wrestling event, let alone a wrestlermania.  Considered by everyone who's ever come in contact with it to be the worst in mania history, here my rundown.
Before I get into the matches there's the setting, a lot behind ceasers palace souped up greek decorations that when the wind blows (and it did allot) the banners revealed bleachers and who is sitting on teh bleachers but the around 7,000 in gurth crowd if that...pathetic.  Its not just that the matches all stink but having Randy Savage do color commentary and having Jim Ross excitedly ramble of comments like this ""is the greatest night of my life"" make the whole thing almost unbearable.  Oh yes the matches.
HBK vs Tatanka:  Decent enough, but the rind was covered in shadows from the angle the sun was hitting the tent over the ring
Bob Backlund vs Razor-Scott Hall:  Bob Backlund comes out looking like its he's never seen the sun and from the looks of it like his dresscodes never left the 80's the crowd hates him but he continues to play face the entire match until mercifully Hall pins him, the match was terrible.
Steiners vs Headshinkers:  Torture absolute torture, fill in teh blanks cluster _____ with Rick Steiner messing up the Frankensteiner to close out a trip the stands for a soda.
Gonzales vs Undertaker:  El Gante or Gonzales is such an athlete he wears a spandex outfit airbrushed with muscles and a pair of trunks that resemble hair only a 70's adult movie could sustain. And oh yeah he never leaves his feet, sound like a good 20 minutes of watching, well back to teh stands.
Lex Luger vs Mr. Perfect:  Finally if all else fails at least you know that Henning always delivers the goods.  Well during Lugers intro the sparkler props he has get picked up by the wind and barely englite and afterwards Henning jobs like a Saturday Morning nobody, who booked this stuff.
Hulk Hogan and Brutus vs Money Inc: Well its been awhile since these two've been around and so the crowd pops...at first, Hogan comes out with a black eye-looking all 230 pounds and Brutus well who knows if it was him because he wore a face protecter that looked like someone put ketchup and mustard on it, the match was all about on thing a hot tag to hogan and anyone watching wish the L.O.D. would come out and destroy this mockery of tag team wrestling.
Doink vs Crucsh:  I'm not wastingmy time with this heres my review...it sucks.
Yokozuna vs Bret Hart, probably the best match on the card with Hart doing allot of work to make the match decent, Yokozuna even puts on a good preformance...but hold off that last cheer.  Sure Yokozuna makes the pin, but oh well the federations in good hands with a monster heel...but wait whats this, why of everybody in the back including EMT does Hogan and Hogan alone come out to check on Hart?  Well Mr. Fuji will disdirect teh viewer with some bad acting and get Hogan in the ring to meet Yokozunas challenge and even though this is the Main Event and Yokozuna's this unstoppable monster, Hogan jobs him in 9 seconds flat...the world title is offocially meaning less.  And worse yet Hogan and is ego return to the top of the wrestling world to stink up rings coast to coast.  A sad day in pro wrestling, this video should be a drama.",1066694400,,3294,4.54222972972973

From WMVIII until WMIX, Warrior, Justice, Piper, Roberts etc. were gone because of this and Flair left because he wanted to return to WCW. Also, Savage was in the broadcast booth instead of the ring.
Bret Hart was being pushed as the next top star of the company but he was not ready yet for a World title push and the title was thrust upon him without proper buildup. Yokozuna was the the top heel although he had only been in the company since October and was not ready to main event.
Hogan had just returned because Vince asked him to return due to failing ratings and was not in any major program and had no legitimate heels to feud with, so this is what we were left with. A messed up card that looked more like an overhyped Monday Night Raw than a Wrestlemania.

The actual card I would have liked to see if things were different and Warrior did not leave, Flair didn't bolt early, Savage was in the ring, and Hogan did not return and Bret did not win the title yet would have something like this that would have been likely:

WWF championship match:
Ultimate Warrior vs. Ric Flair (c)

Intercontinetal championship match:
Shawn Michaels (c) vs. Marty Jannetty

World tag team championship match
The Nasty Boys  vs. Money Inc (c)

Bret Hart vs. Randy Savage
Mr. Perfect vs. Lex Luger
The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzalez
Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. Yokozuna
Crush vs. Doink the Clown
Steiner Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers
El Matador vs. Razor Ramon
Tatanka vs. Jerry Lawler
Kamala vs. Bam Bam Bigelow",1285113600,,1657,4.562289562289562

The worst match and thats saying alot on this whole card was Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez which was a total dud. Hulk Hogan's super-size ego made his finish the ""WORST WRESTLEMANIA ENDING EVER"" by not only appecting Mr. Fuji's challenge to face Yokozuna for the WWE title but also by beating Yoko in 21 seconds and what's with Jim Ross's toga and Giant Gonzalez's spray-painted suit? Who did their clothes? Stevie Wonder? The only ""GOOD"" matches on the whole card were the Intercontinental & the World Tag Team Championship matches. The ""best"" moments were Bobby Heenan's entrance on a camal and ironically Hulk Hogan's title win. The worst moment and thats saying alot was the 2 Doinks during the Crush-Doink match. The rest on both sides were crud. I give this event a 0 out of 10.",1277078400,,925,4.860759493670886
7829850,3,6302715563,"Yeah this PPV gets a bad rap, but it ain't that bad. Sure, the main event is bogus, the Undertaker match isn't as good as it could have been, and the IC championship had one of the worst endings ever to an amazing match. Overall it was pretty fun. Macho Man and Bobby The Brain have some pretty funny banter and the fact its outside is pretty sweet. I'd chose Wrestlemania X over this, but its a must for any fan of the early 90s.",1246838400,,430,4.070588235294117
7829851,2,6302715563,"Considered as one of the worst Wrestlemania's, I dug it out to see how bad it was. It's too bad Savage is on commentating rather then wrestling at this event.

Tatanka VS Shawn Michaels: When I was young Tatanka was my favorite wrestler. Micheals hit a super kick as Tatanka came off the top rope was a cool moment. The match was slow paced but had its moments. A near twenty minute opener with a bad ending.

Steiner Brothers VS Headshrinkers: Thank god they didn't use Bushwhackers or Beverly Brothers. A great tag match and the last few minutes were exciting.

Crush VS Doink: Doink could wrestle despite the stupid gimmick. It was a decent feud but I don't remember Crush every winning. The ending was lame.

Razor Ramon VS Bob Backund: I'd say a squash match but Backlund did get a few moves in here and there. A fine match with a quick, weird finish.

Money Inc VS Mega Maniacs: A typical Hogan tag match, with his partner getting beat and Hogan trying to get in. The match was fine but the ending sucked.

Mr Perfect VS Lex Luger: Mr Perfect screws up the prematch interview in a funny moment. A good match even though the ending was a little stupid. HBK attacks Perfect after the match in a violent encounter that was rarely seen back in those days.

Undertaker vs Giant Gonzalez: Not as bad as I remeber or thought. The ending once again sucked.

Bret Hart VS Yokozuna: These two put on a great match; I really liked this feud. Yoko pins Hart after Fuji helps and out comes the man who ruined WWF-Hulk Hogan!

Hogan pins Yoko within seconds for the world title in a dumb move. Hogan would be gone from WWF in a matter of months to usher in the new era.

A decent WrestleMania that had good matches but the results were disappointing. The main event was good but I hated Hogan winning the title. It was the last of the classic WrestleMaina's as WWF would go on to the new generation within a year.",1235174400,,1905,4.386363636363637
