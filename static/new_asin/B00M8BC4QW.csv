6564459,4,B00M8BC4QW,"More than a movie - it is a condition of life we (believers in God's Word) will have to soon take. 'Accidental Activist' sets the stage where a casual believer signs a petition upholding something he hadn't given much thought to in the past - the definition of Marriage being between only a man and a woman. One Gay man is able to stir passive gay folk to anger, and out of hatred for the Christian's beliefs, claim the Christian is a bigot and a hater. Jesus told us to weigh the consequences before we take up our Cross. Ted Murphy did not consider doing this until he was forced to. The outcome was a man who matured to recognize the importance of doing this. Spoiler Ted's life was turned upside down and he lost his business. At this conclusion, the movie leaves the viewer wanting a happy ending (Ted holding onto his business, and seeing the Truth prevail) but it is a more realistic end, where a secular media distorts truth in favor of sin. The Excellence in the ending is that one soul (Ted) was changed - and will now stand up for Jesus and what he knows is right - no matter the cost. The writer had a heavenly perspective here. As much as I yearned for a 'happy ending' where the sinner repents, our need (as a believer) to experience justice will only be slightly satisfied (and is getting less so every week) while we are on this side of heaven.",1435622400,2,1360,4.337254901960784
6564460,1,B00M8BC4QW,"The title was good, it caught my eye and as a Christian appalled at the amount of bigotry being displayed against my faith, I found it hard to identify with either the LGBT or the ""Accidental Activist"".

I guess the most disturbing thing about this film was the lack of any conclusion. Hoppy and the gang just road off into the sunset with nothing resembling a resolution favoring either side.

There was no reason given for the protests and certainly no reason for signing the petition in the first place.

Hebrews 13:4 says, ""Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.""

""Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."" Leviticus 18:22

These Biblical points didn't even get paraphrased.

I'd sat it was poorly acted, poorly directed and poorly written.",1416700800,6,838,4.907801418439717
8670693,1,B00M8BC4QW,"I don't get why this was even made. Are we supposed to feel bad for this guy because he's trying to force people to follow his religion? Nobody would actually picket people for signing petitions, this is incredibly unrealistic. It's pretty much bigoted anti-gay pro-hate propaganda.",1525651200,,282,5.1521739130434785

8670698,4,B00M8BC4QW,"A timely film in our backwards, leftist saturated society today where disagreeing with someone (who holds leftist views) is hateful, yet persecuting someone for their religious beliefs is not.  I do wish they would have thrown in a line or two about how the left loves to stay true to their inconsistency by falling all over themselves to accommodate Islam while Muslims are throwing homosexuals off roof tops in the middle east or ""honor killing"" their daughters in America for becoming Christian, while turning a blind eye to homosexuals violently assaulting street preachers.  Or even how marriage is not legally recognized to be a right, but a privilege, otherwise one would not require a license for it, or how civil unions already grant homosexuals all the legal rights that married heterosexuals would have.  But still it was a decent movie and family (you know, men and women and the children that biology allows them to have and to raise) friendly.",1464307200,6,957,4.96875

8670700,5,B00M8BC4QW,"It was a good, realistic, decently acted story. But why not show that traditional marriage is gender-inclusive diversity of the sexes - male and female! In contrast, homosexuality is a gender-exclusive orientation.

In other words, God's idea of one man one woman (i.e. sexual diversity and equality), in the Bible, is the oldest equal rights institution!",1446854400,4,355,5.339285714285714
8670701,1,B00M8BC4QW,"This 58 minute film was produced by the American Family Association (AFA), an anti-gay group labelled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. It tells the story of Ted, happily married Christian father of three. One day, he signs a petition in support of traditional marriage (that is, against gay marriage). Before long, his name appears in a gay newspaper and gay activists make threatening phone calls and start picketing outside his business. It's never made clear why the gay activist singled Ted out, of all the people who signed the petition, but it may have something to do with the fact that the gay rights group and it's leader, an evil Italian, want his business to fail so that they can move into his property. Ted didn't want to make a big deal out of this, but now he has to decide whether he will stand up for his beliefs, even as the angry, intolerant gays want to silence him. The movie ends rather abruptly and I wonder why they didn't bother making it into a real feature length film.

""Accidental Activist"" is another (lesser known) movie in the genre of Christian films in which christians in America are portrayed as persecuted for their beliefs (better known examples would be ""God's Not Dead"", ""Last Ounce of Courage"" and ""Christmas with a Capital C"". If you like that genre and think this sounds like a great story, give ""Accidental Activist"" a try. If not, don't bother.",1439251200,9,1408,4.6546184738955825
