1847794,5,B00008H2I5,"I also bought the 5 sets of ""Benny Hill Complete and Unadulterated"" - they all play fine on my computer here in Australia. .. but the ""Benny Hill's World Tour: New York"" will not play in Australia automatically - as it states it is set to ""Region 1"" - just 'google' to easily find a solution. After watching, I felt sad to see Benny like this - there are a couple rehashed jokes from many years ago - I liked the Dr Ruth impression ... not sure about the Roseanne impression though - I felt that Benny needn't have altered his accent so much to cater for a US audience. They loved his work from the past, so why did he feel the need to attempt the various US accents? To me, alot of the Benny Hill magic was lost.",1154822400,5,713,4.1

7984308,4,B00008H2I5,"I'm a big Benny Hill fan. I had originally taped this when it aired in the 1990s, but the DVD is far more clearer and features skits and numbers edited from the live version of the episode. The episode was taped on location in NYC with a small band of unknowns with the interior shots with the regular cast at the famed Teddington Studio in London. No bonus features though.",1493337600,,374,4.357142857142857

7984310,5,B00008H2I5,"BENNY HILLS WORLD TOUR NEW YORK is classic Benny. As far as i can tell this is the last show that Benny did before his untimely passing. Yes there are comedy bits youve seen before but updated with a New York style. Benny and his comedy pals all shine brilliantly throughout this special. The video audio transfers are ok,nothing special but for the price i say go ahead and buy this. It will give you an hours worth of hearty laughs.",1401667200,,434,4.37037037037037

7984312,5,B00008H2I5,"I've known of Benny Hill for several decades. I used to catch his programs late on Saturday night and into Sunday morning here in America...several channels aired his program back to back...I'd catch the shows often and each time they were funny. Years later, as an adult, I've come to love the comedy even more. This particular special has largely gotten a mixed reaction since it's debut in the early '90s, prior to Benny Hill's death. I've seen the special and in no way do I find that it's something Benny should have been ashamed of or embarrassed about.

There's been criticism of him recycling jokes but I've always felt that this is essentially an unfair criticism considering that Hill's comedy programs, for Thames TV, aired a couple of times a year from the late '60s through the late '80s and chances are that viewers weren't going to recall a joke or set-up line when his programs were spaced apart by a period of months. Now, unfortunately, as a result of his hour long shows having long been edited and spliced together in half hour installments for international syndication, a lot of clips that in real time had been taped years apart could often be seen in one single half hour episode...with the possibility of back to back half hour episodes featuring sketches that had similar set-up lines and gags. A lot of the time I happen to feel that comedians love to cling to sure-fire jokes and gags and play around with the timing, etc. in hopes maybe getting bigger laughs the next time they tell the joke. All comedians do it.

In a lot of ways, and it's my opinion, I tend to think that by this point in his career and the enormous success the syndicated program enjoyed in America, that this special was designed to allow his American fan-base the opportunity to see him perform his brand of humor and classic jokes/gags in person. Much like a country or pop singer giving a concert, you mainly go to see the artist sing their 'hits' and anything new they're working on. In the case of Benny Hill's New York special it comes off the same as his prior programs for Thames TV. There's a lot of singing, patter, impressions, double entendre, innuendo, and a sped up sketch.

Also, just like the concert scenario earlier mentioned, Benny delivers the 'hits' in the form of beloved gags, both visual and verbal, that fans come to expect and some things that are new such as the mockery of Dr. Ruth and Roseanne Barr (as a visual gag, note the jiggling) and a parody, of sorts, on Indiana Jones titled ""Raiders of the Lost Jungle"" in which Benny plays a frustrated director speaking to an unseen Harrison Ford. The various sketches on this program could easily be lifted from the special and edited together with clips from any program of his from the 1980's or even the late 1970's and I bet a viewer, not familiar with this New York special, would insist that any number of these clips originated during the ""classic years"".

Long time side-kicks Henry McGee and Bob Todd are featured in several of the sketches...and that causes me to wonder why another reviewer proclaimed that there's nobody on this special from Benny's older programs. The funniest sketches involve Benny's spoof of ""A Streetcar Named Desire""; Benny's Chinese character, Chow Mein, as a ventriloquist; the Cold sketch featuring Henry McGee attempting to decipher the slang expressions of Hill's character; and then the bar/gangster sketch that leads into the end credits featuring a sped-up chase that often ended his TV programs as Boots Randolph's ""Yakety Sax"" plays in the background. In the bar scene, one of the bad guys looked like Jackie Wright, known as 'the little bald guy' by many Benny Hill fans. He died in 1989 and so Benny must've found a distant look-a-like for this sketch.

This is a cute, funny, and hilarious display of comedy from Benny Hill and considering that one of the reasons for Hill's program being canceled by Thames TV in 1989, a couple of years prior to this special, is that Hill appeared tired...well, this special goes a long way of showing that Benny Hill could still deliver the goods and flash those facial expressions just as before and his timing remained impeccable. Sure, Benny is older, everyone ages, but his style and his comedic timing and delivery and the joy he obviously had performing is clearly abundant in this New York special.",1379376000,2,4365,4.723097112860892
7984313,5,B00008H2I5,"Going all the way back to when I was growing up, I have always loved Benny Hill. I thought his humor was hysterically hilarious. This, being the last time before he untimely passed on in 1992 (a sad date for all true Benny Hill fans) that he was on TV, and that I know of, in the United States was a riot. I love it and I think it is hilarious. All in all, a good buy.",1360022400,2,368,3.792207792207792

7984316,1,B00008H2I5,"It pains me to say this, but this is probably Benny Hill's worst effort.  It is nothing more than remakes of sketches from the original show with New York backgrounds and unknown replacement actors.  And no Hill's Angels.  Stick to the original shows",1185321600,,250,4.767441860465116
