8600280,5,B0036R8S1C,"Saw this film in a theater in Asbury Park. Love the feel on this film. Grant it I am A Jersey Surfer but that did not make me want to like it. The tone, music, and cuts of the film show an even flow and the film never tries to hard on itself.  I might be off, but year round, since getting a copy on dvd, this film has stayed out on my shelf never far from my player. When you get tired of every one rippin' on thrusters to beer infused punk, which i also enjoy.( Not too much into the pro surfer films, I'm sure you know the ones I'm talking about that are basically for self promotion) Through out the film naration is heard from undisclosed surfers and names never flash up on the screen. Which was fine and when you want to know its in the commentry bonus featuer which is ggreat to hear after watching the film the first few times.  Had to get a second copy after my kids scratched it up slamming it into the dvd player. Yeah its there favorite. Hope it gets re released with a soundtrack. Last Note .
PEOPLE WILL FInD THIS FILM, be one of them",1393372800,,1049,4.038461538461538
