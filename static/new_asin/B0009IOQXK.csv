2292880,4,B0009IOQXK,Each Disk contains 2 Episodes of this series which seems odd considering the fact that it would be more efficent to have all 4 parts on one disk and shift the special features onto the bonus disk. Wish it was in widescreen but the transfers are very good as is.,1171411200,2,261,4.24
2292881,5,B0009IOQXK,"If you like macross ad you love the movie version (with Guld Goa Bowman and Isamu Dyson and of course Sharon Apple) then you need to buy this set.  I prefer if over the other movie version which is edited for time and has some of the ""fat trimmed"".  I like every part of this story and wanted to own it in its fullness.  If you haven't yet seen the story, but you like transforming jet fighter anime and are partial to emotional storylines then you will love Macross Plus, and you might want to own it anyway, since its a collectable classic.",1155168000,,542,4.242718446601942
2292882,5,B0009IOQXK,"I nearly crapped myself when I opened the first disc and saw that it said ""MOVIE EDITION"".  I quickly opened the second case and on that disc it said ""Macross Plus: Volume 2 (Parts 3+4).  I was like ""WTF Mate"".  So I inserted the 1st disc thinking it was the movie and they got some weird packaging problem that sent me the movie edition instead of volume 1.  But to my delight, the ""Movie Edition"" is indeed Volume 1.  (In case you're wondering, there are two versions of this series; a single disc ""Movie Edition"" that is a full length feature film and a two disc 4 episode (45 min each) set.  Each has there good qualities but are different in minor ways.  The story is much more complete in the two disc set but some people have complained that it drags a little.  Also the story has a different ending.  I like both and recommend either.)

The extras were kind of lacking for a 10th anniversary disc (Is it just me or is Manga going WAAAAAYYYYY downhill in quality just slapping things together with no regard for what fans want and love) and the menu was rather plain.

But despite some obvious lack of attention to details and minimal extras for a 10th anniversary disc, this set and the episodes in general rock!  If you haven't seen this before it's definately a keeper and the price of this Two-Disc set is ripe for the picking.  The sound and visual quality are outstanding, the dubbing is amazing, and although the animation is getting a little dated it's still way above par.  The music alone is worth watching it.  If you're an Anime fan than you're probably familiar with Yoko Kanno's work. (Cowboy Beebop, Ghost in the Shell:SAC, Wolf's Rain, Escaflowne, and the list goes on)  But of all Anime's I've seen, I have never been moved by a score like I was moved with this one.  I have no doubt that if you watch this that you will be amazed.",1139961600,30,1855,4.408823529411765
2292883,4,B0009IOQXK,"The best Macross since the original. Kawamori can do no wrong(*cough*Arjuna*hack*). This is probably the best non-epic story he's ever told. And the animation is some of the best, if not the best, I've seen outside of a feature film(even after 11 years). What I can't understand is why Manga Video has not added anything to the DVD for this great anime, yet this is the ""10th Anniversary Edition"". The original Ghost in the Shell release by Manga Video had few extras and no 5.1 surround track in Japanese. Their new GitS 10th aniversary release had many more extras and a great new 5.1 surround track in japanese. Why hasn't Macross Plus seen this kind of treatment? Apparently they just threw both volumes of the OVA into a box, cut a few bucks off the original price and called it a special anniverary edition. I already own the original DVD releases of this show and would have eagerly forked over another $40 to get them in full japanese language surround. C'Mon Manga Video, you've had 10 years to improve the DVD's for this show. What's the deal?",1137369600,22,1053,4.636363636363637
2292884,5,B0009IOQXK,"I post this quick review in the absense of any others. Macross Plus certainly deserves more, but for what its worth let me say this is one the the very best animations I've ever come across (and I am a collector). Its unstopable, in terms of animation, character that develope, plot, music (yokko kano), everything. Treat yourself to this collection, its a bit better than the movie edition, fleshing the sequel to the original Macross' story out across a four episode epic. Two rival pilots, two experimental next gen VF jets, one lost love, and an out of control virtual AI Diva that takes control of the Macross.",1132876800,11,615,4.703703703703703

2292897,5,B0009IOQXK,"Being a Robotech fan is hard going back to the roots of were Robotech originated from the Macross series is a gem and sometimes is hard to with some of their more punk musical orientated fighting series like Macross7 or their last series Macross Frontier but I couldn't save with honesty that this Plus series in the Macross zero series has a more straightforward less silly juvenile musical orientated fighting battles and it. There is at least three different versions of the series I know if not more that means all the same material but edited at least three different ways and also dubbed or with subtitles changing the story a little bit here and a little bit there I've gotten one version that I could not find recorded on late-night TV and the two other versions I've bought here on Amazon the TV series and the movie addition.

My disappointment now is that they have come out with a Blu-ray version of some of the Macross story lines but they're all imports in all extremely expensive",1386633600,,994,4.6158192090395485

2292901,5,B0009IOQXK,"I'm a newcomer to the Macross series.
I started watching the original series ""Super Demension Fortress Macross"" and just fell in love with it.
At first I was wary of it because of the concept of fighting enemies with singing. But I gave it a chance and it won me over. The use of singing is explained and it makes sense.
This movie has all the space invasion take a back seat to the characters. Which are intriguing, sympathetic, mysterious and tragic all in one.
The Drama of the characters is enhanced by the wonderful music by Yoko Kanno. I have the song 'Voices' playing whenever I can.
The art and animation is top notch and fluid.
I highly recommend this OVA to anyone looking for a strong, beautiful, character driven anime.",1367280000,,731,4.545454545454546

visuals are very well done for it time. I can tell is was traditionally animated because how colors looks. The line art  is very well done.
The action scenes are exiting

the bad
Macross plus has love triangle in it that not so clear. I just realize it had one after watching. It spends too much time on characters. episode 2 feel like it was dragging it feet. Lot stuff that was happen front and center should been in back ground. The I.A. should have gone rouge in episode 2 leave the rest of mini series action packed how ever it does go rouge until end of episode 3 when the mini series is 69 percent over.

fan service
Sharon Apple the A.I. appears a few times in low detail nudity. The reason that write this because in the ratings it does not say what it rated for. on youtube it just says it is rated tv-14.",1305417600,,824,4.169811320754717
2292905,1,B0009IOQXK,"Normally when I see a product universally get 5 stars I give it the benefit of the doubt.  I grew up watching Robotech on TV and recently purchased the Protoculture DVD collection.  On Youtube I have also watched clips from the Japanese originals (particularly Mospeada, which could've been a masterpiece if not for the sloppy writing that led to glaring inconsistencies).  Needless to say, I am a huge fan of Robotech-related stuff.  I had even bought the Shadow Chronicles despite the bad reviews, because I had to see even an imperfect sequel to the series.

My problem with Macross+ somewhat stems from my issues with the original Macross- a little too much Rick-Lisa-Minmei love triangle which detracted from mecha, Zentraedi, and overall plot- but the original still had much more over this sequel in terms of characters and plot.  Rick Hunter was a likable hero, a free-spirit pilot who became a warrior to protect the woman he loved (which ironically led them to part ways).  Many fans dislike Minmei, but one has to admit that she was supposed to depict a normal, self-centered person who was shot into fame.  Lisa despite her fragility also was likable and proved by the end to be the match for Rick.  Then there was the inter-species romance between Max and Miriya.  And who can forget Breetai?  All of this was set within the context of an epic war between Earth and the Zentraedi, with a number of plot twists involving the Zentraedi who most certainly were not one-dimensional villains.

Macross+ had no epic plot or alien invasion.  As the positive reviewers here note, the plot centers around a competition for the new Veritech.  No explanation is given as to the threat that the new Veritech is meant to fight (even the movie Top Gun featured the fictional Soviet MiG-28 as the threat).  What happened to the Zentraedi?  The enemy turns out to be (and trust me, this isn't a spoiler) a computer.  There is no sense of a grand struggle for the future of the planet that characterized Robotech or Macross.  There is no exploration of the terrors of war.  The story just boils down to testosterone, soap-opera drama, and LOTS of pointless dialogue to fast-forward through.

Isamu, the main protagonist of this veritech competition drama, made this anime almost unwatchable for me.  The writers went to incredible lengths to make Isamu a truly despicable, arrogant jerk with an utter lack of human empathy.  I cheered whenever he was beaten up or humiliated, and to no great surprise I rooted for his adversary/ex-friend Guld until it was revealed near the end that he wasn't such a great person either.  The forgettable love interest whose name I don't recall was a rather flat character.  It was fairly impossible to connect with any of the characters, much unlike the original Macross.

What more can I say?  The animation and sound were good, but those don't make a good story.",1303603200,7,2894,4.81947261663286
2292906,5,B0009IOQXK,This is one of my favorite Animes of all time. The ova is a little better but you lose nothing with this one. The story is about two ace pilots competing for a defense contract. There is a love interest and a good amount of flight time. All in all its allot like Top Gun done in Anime and the animation surely has stood the test of time.,1300665600,,337,3.9705882352941178

2292908,5,B0009IOQXK,"Just like the box says ""Shoji Kawamori's Epic Series""

Macross Pluss was the most expensive anime of its time(due to the very much unneeded CG) but with that you can expect GREAT visuals & an awesome soundtrack. The show only contains 4 episodes but the story starts and ends nicely, and manages to develop the characters in that short amount of time.",1278374400,,351,4.661290322580645

2292910,5,B0009IOQXK,"I saw the first video many years ago, so when I had the opportunity to buy it I did, and so far I have no regrets. This is an awesome little part of the bigger puzzle that is the macross saga. These episodes have such amazing animation sequences, that they made my head spin. I encourage others to buy these videos (or DVD's) and enjoy their quality and storyline, not to mention the amazing transforming veritech fighters.",1229385600,,423,4.5064935064935066
2292911,4,B0009IOQXK,"The Macross anime series actually is really interesting.  The idea of Macross Plus, however, has, to me, one of the best plots they have ever.  It is about 2 ex-best friends fighting over a girl--the one they have been friends with just as long as they themselves were.  It's basically a love triangle drama.  Macross Plus is great, except for one fact--it's a bit slow.  I actually fell asleep halfway through it, then had to replay what I had slept past.  However, if you can get past that, you get a decent if not great anime movie with great music. Good luck deciding. =)",1220313600,,575,4.480769230769231
2292912,5,B0009IOQXK,"I purchased this originally on VHS when Manga released it on 4 VHS tapes 1995-1996. This DVD provides nothing new. There is no commentary or behind-the-scenes featurette. The old 'next episode' previews and previews of 'coming soon' releases (from 1996 - many of the previewed titles have been out for a decade) are the special features. These can be found on the old VHS tapes too.

The real advantages to buying this DVD collection are the lower cost and that you get both the sub and the dub.

The lack of special features is more than made up for by the 4-part OVA. This is a side story. The original Macross was the story of how humanity survived an encounter with highly advanced giant soldiers. This story is set decades after Macross. It's about a design competition between two companies to build the next Valkyrie (a jet that transforms into a giant robot). The two opposing test pilots have a shared past - and an intense rivalry.

The mecha fight scenes are very fast, highly detailed, and even somewhat realistic (for a sci-fi show about transforming airplanes made with alien technology that borders on high fantasy). The characters have quite a bit of depth. They aren't relatively innocent kids taking the final step into  adulthood, as in the Macross TV series. These characters are definitely adults with quite a bit of emotional baggage.

The tension is quite high - I still remember the very sharp cliff-hangers at then end of each part. In the VHS days, you had to wait 4 or 5 months for the next volume to be released. grrr

The music is excellent. These aren't songs and instrumental tracks you listen to without the movie. The music really supports the movie. It supports, and sometimes creates the emotional tone for the scene. There are also very unique - and odd sound choices.

The cover bills it as 'the top-gun of anime'. As cheesy as it sounds, they're right. I'd even recommend this to people who don't normally watch anime.",1215907200,10,1956,4.701754385964913
