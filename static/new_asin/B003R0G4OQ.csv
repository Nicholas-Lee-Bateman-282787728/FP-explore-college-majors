8402866,2,B003R0G4OQ,It was delivered on time and in decent order. The movie wasn't what I expected but that is my choice and no one elses.,1376611200,,118,3.9583333333333335
8402867,1,B003R0G4OQ,I can't believe I wasted money watching this. The acting is terrible.  A total waste of my money.  It looks like this movie was shot with a cam corder.  The actors all need to go to acting school.,1336780800,,196,4.105263157894737
8402868,5,B003R0G4OQ,"What a Fantastic Job done by these guys!!! I really enjoyed the film & wonder whats coming next!! The main character is Hot, but I would have loved to have seen a bit more of the Salon Girls.",1323129600,,191,4.052631578947368
8402869,1,B003R0G4OQ,"I purchase many movies and I have been fortunate so far to buy pretty good B-list movies.  Boy was I wrong with this one.  It didn't even deserve 1 star. I don't know who rated this movie or gave it more than 1 star, but it was absolutely awful!  Both the acting and plot were terrible. I don't even think this was a real production.  It was like someone was following the actors around with a video camera filming.  Don't waste your money or your time.",1286841600,2,453,4.22093023255814
8402870,5,B003R0G4OQ,"I loved this movie! If you're into making bets with your boys and chasing women, then you've got to see this. These guys are so random and will do anything to prove they can get a girl. Get ready for a funny movie with some unforgettable bar scenes! Check it out.",1284940800,,263,4.176470588235294
8402871,5,B003R0G4OQ,"I like supporting independent filmmakers and 'Date for Hire' was more than worthy of my attention.  Forget the Ab-Roller, just watch cute but bumbling Marcus (M. Jennings) try to win a bet that he'll get a date with the next girl to walk into his local bar.  Your abs will get a laughter workout instead.  Romus Reece is also excellent as Lamont, the lone voice of reason in a sea of wackiness.",1281484800,,394,4.444444444444445
8402872,5,B003R0G4OQ,"I was lucky enough to snag the original version of this film a few months back and I loved every minute of the film. Its funny, the characters are endearing, and you can't hep but want to know what happened to all of them when the movie is over. Some of the gags are funnier if you are from the Bay Area but overall it is a well done Indie Comedy. Personally I think the film is a great set up for a sitcom...hope to see that happen!",1280966400,,433,3.9318181818181817
8402873,5,B003R0G4OQ,"I was totally skeptical when my boyfriend dragged me to this movie... but I found myself laughing, rooting for the totally zany characters, and excited to see what happened next! I laughed hard throughout the film. It's a buddy flick with tons of excellent moments, likeable characters, fun, and craziness. See it!",1280880000,,314,5.0576923076923075
8402874,5,B003R0G4OQ,"I saw this movie in the movie theater.  I enjoyed this film, and I can't believe it was shot for under $1000 dollars in 20 days.  Its looks so professional and high end.  It`s so zany.  It reminds me of ""Hangover"" meets ""Superbad"".  You won't believe all the things that happen to these guys in 24hrs.  The adult theme is definitely for a mature audience.  With that said, please bring a second pair of underwear because you are going to soil the ones you have on.",1280880000,,464,4.325581395348837
8402875,5,B003R0G4OQ,"If you're looking for a fun ""date night"" type of flick, check out ""Date for Hire"".  It has the feel of ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"", with less of the vulgarity that permeates those two admittedly hilarious films.  The characters of Marcus and his endearingly goofy pals really make you feel for their dilemmas.  Marcus in particular is one of the most loveable and likeable losers in recent memory.  I had a good time watching it, and I'm sure you will too.",1279411200,,455,4.580246913580247
