2089237,1,B0002F6AYI,"I purchased this after reading the other reviews...wow that was a mistake.  The DVD is poor quality. It is short,thankfully, because if I had to hear the witch scream/cackle one more time I think my brain might have exploded.  We watch other programs over and over, but I could only stand to sit through this one once.  My daughter was not interested in it at all.  It is definitely going into the goodwill box at first opportunity for someone else to enjoy/hate.",1256083200,,463,4.609756097560975
2089238,5,B0002F6AYI,This has been an all time favorite of my six year old grandson for the past two years.  You can't go wrong with this for age three and up.,1237248000,,138,3.7586206896551726
2089239,2,B0002F6AYI,Overall a cute story but it was very short and definitely not worth the money.  Skip this one for Spookely the Pumpkin.  It states that the movie is 30 mins but it was more like 20mins plus the very long credits.,1225152000,,212,4.146341463414634
2089240,5,B0002F6AYI,"This is a cute story for the under 6 crowd.  It's only a 30 minute cartoon (it does come with a CD of spooky sounds), so I think the price is a little steep.  I got it at Sam's for just under $9, which I also think is a lot for such a short DVD, but, my son (age 4) enjoys it.",1190246400,7,276,3.435483870967742
2089241,5,B0002F6AYI,"This is a fun little Halloween story about 3 sisters that are witches. Two of the sisters are incompetent and  seem to get their spells a little mixed up. The other sister is in charge and very powerful indeed. The other two are trying to make pumpkin pies to throw at trick or treaters when they accidentally turn their sister into a pumpkin that rolls away and they lose her. Since she is a pumpkin, she cannot perform magic. They are tempted to leave her like that since she is so mean, but they eventually decide to track her down and try to help her. In the meantime a young boy finds the witch-pumpkin and thinks she is a battery operated toy talking pumpkin and uses her as the centerpiece for his Halloween party.

All in all a good story for the holiday, very funny, and no scary moments for smaller kids. 25 minutes long. Lots of laughs for the older ones, cute characters, good jokes and sight gags. I recommend.",1129161600,25,923,4.391812865497076
2089292,5,B0002F6AYI,Cute Halloween movie for the family to watch together.,1470960000,,54,5.111111111111111
2089293,4,B0002F6AYI,this is a very cute funny video,1462320000,,31,3.5714285714285716
2089294,1,B0002F6AYI,"My grandchildren, ages 3 and one half and 5, did not sit through more than 10 minutes of this. It was noisy and silly, with little to redeem it. I would prefer to have them see characters that they can admire rather than three animated stooges.",1446940800,,244,4.326086956521739
2089295,1,B0002F6AYI,Bad language for little kids and negative language.,1445558400,,51,5.5
2089296,5,B0002F6AYI,Love this movie so cute,1443484800,,23,3.8
2089297,4,B0002F6AYI,It arrived in good condition and on time and I am happy with my purchase. It is the usual rollicking humor that from the same people who do Bugs Bunny. Loved it.,1429401600,,161,4.0625
2089298,5,B0002F6AYI,My grandson likes this.,1421712000,,23,5.0
2089299,3,B0002F6AYI,My daughter likes this movie but I don't. The voices of the witches makes it hard to understand everything and the overall story is a bit lame. If we hadn't bought it digitally I'd return it.,1416528000,,191,4.333333333333333
2089300,1,B0002F6AYI,"The description of this movie says that it is dubbed in French, but it is not!!  There is no menu to change the language and I bought it for no reason!!  I will be returning it!  If the Amazon description says that it is dubbed in French then it should be dubbed in French!  Disappointed!",1414713600,,288,4.181818181818182
2089301,1,B0002F6AYI,DO NOT PURCHASE!  Save your money.  I promise.,1414108800,,46,4.625

2089323,5,B0002F6AYI,We watched this for free on prime last year. Bought it this year for a trip with no internet. Boys loved watching this on plane. Fun movie for kids.,1387497600,,148,4.137931034482759
2089324,1,B0002F6AYI,This movie was simply irritating.  There was almost no plot and the loud screeching of the witches was so hard to listen to.  My grandkids were bored with this movie within about the first five minutes.  I did not even keep this movie since I knew we would not want to watch it again.  Very disappointing.,1384387200,,305,4.392857142857143
2089325,5,B0002F6AYI,LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I think everybody should watch this. Very cute and VERY family friendly. I did have a couple laughs out of it myself.,1384041600,,138,4.346153846153846
2089326,5,B0002F6AYI,My grands 1  1/2 and  3. 1/2  just love it. They will be laughing out loud. Anything that makes them laugh makes me laugh. It is cute as can be.,1368489600,,144,3.7333333333333334
2089327,5,B0002F6AYI,This was a great show my nephew could on turn away from it i would recommend it to  other people,1365811200,,96,3.8
2089328,5,B0002F6AYI,"Daughter sufferes from depression and I bought her this to try and cheer her up. It worked so good when she starts getting depressed I suggest she watch it and she does, and it helps every time. I can't help but laugh at it too. It's these three witch sisters. One is serious and the other two are not as smart as her and keep messing things up. It's Holloween and they accidently turn the serious one into a pumpkin, which doesn't set well with her. Buy it, it's worth it.",1359676800,,473,4.208791208791209
2089329,2,B0002F6AYI,I bought this for my classroom and it was a little to much for them.  They didn't really like it.,1354233600,,97,3.85
2089330,5,B0002F6AYI,Cute show about three sister witches who can't seem to stay out of trouble. It is great to finally have it on DVD.,1351382400,,114,4.0
2089331,1,B0002F6AYI,First animated show my 3.5yr old boys volunteered to stop watching. Really bad animation with a lot of shrill screeching.,1351209600,3,121,5.1
2089342,3,B0002F6AYI,I thought this would be cute for my 4 year old boys.  It really didn't hold their attention at all.  I was looking for something with a Halloween theme that wasn't scary.  Really wasn't worth the money.,1351123200,,202,4.405405405405405
2089343,1,B0002F6AYI,"All this did was teach my 5 year old to say ""stupid"" and start howling.....

Did not like this purchase, not even for 2 bucks. Wish there had been a preview.....",1350777600,2,161,4.193548387096774
2089344,5,B0002F6AYI,My daughter said the kids watched this movies four days in a row.  They are 2 and 4.  For some reason they are fasanated by the halloween movies.,1338681600,,145,4.142857142857143
2089345,5,B0002F6AYI,This movie always makes me smile.  Favorite line poof your a witch. It is just one of those movies that if you are having a bad day you watch it and it puts a smile on your face.  It is one of my favorite movies.,1331424000,,212,3.688888888888889
2089346,5,B0002F6AYI,Can be unnerving and obnoxious to the adults but hysterical and fun for the kids. It's a fun cartoon for Halloween.,1289779200,,115,4.523809523809524
2089347,1,B0002F6AYI,"According to my granddaughter, this was just a so-so movie.  The voices were distracting.",1289088000,,89,5.357142857142857
2089348,1,B0002F6AYI,"I bought this based on the other reviews that said it was fun for the whole family--it wasn't fun for anyone.  Even my 3 year old was bored.  I can't believe I paid $10 for something so cheaply made.  It was very short and it reminded me of Flintstones-type animation.  The gags were just stupid; one of the witches said they should go to a hotel and order ""broom service.""  Geez.  It's just not worth the money; we won't be watching this again and now I just feel like I wasted $10.",1287878400,,483,4.195652173913044
2089349,4,B0002F6AYI,"I got this for my granddaughter, and she loves watching it. If you look at it through the eyes of an adult, I don't get it, but she seems to love it, so that is good enough for me.",1272758400,,180,3.641025641025641
2089350,5,B0002F6AYI,"When I saw this video, I don't remember how old I was. I do remember my mom got it on VHS at Kmart around Halloween, and I loved watching this movie over and over until Halloween passed. I never saw it again until last Halloween. the original tape we purchased got lost, and I couldn't remember the title of the movie. After several google searches, I got the title of the movie, and I ordered the DVD right here on Amazon, just intime for Halloween. I love this movie, and I'm sure your kids will too if they haven't seen it yet. It's only about half an hour in length, but it's funny!",1270684800,5,586,4.1946902654867255
2089351,1,B0002F6AYI,"I bought this for my five year old. She immediately hated it.  The sisters start out insulting each other and are quite violent.  We do not have TV, and she is not exposed to popular cultural cartoons.  Perhaps we are just too sensitive.  Regardless, it goes against our message of kindness and sisterly affection.  I prefer ""The Very Brave Witch"" (although she and her sister find some of those stories rather boring).  ""It's the Great Pumpkin,Charlie Brown"" is hilarious, but those kids are really mean to each other too.  It is easier to talk one's kids through it though--the plot and animation are much slower.  My girls both love the ""Elmo Says Boo"" and the Sesame Street Halloween movie.",1256601600,,694,4.773109243697479
8027521,5,B0002F6AYI,"This was my favorite movie as a child! I was so excited to see I could still get a copy. My toddler thought it was hilarious, and me and my husband went in knowing it was just a cute, cheesy 20 to 25 minute video. Very pleased with my purchase!

This movie does have some mean siblings, pretty mild violence, words like stupid and idiotic, and threats to turn people inside out and spell them. Pretty much just like older cartoons would have! Some might find the voices annoying.",1506297600,,479,4.382022471910112

8027526,5,B0002F6AYI,"I LOVE this! I watched this SO MUCH as a kid around Halloween time, it was one of my absolute favorites! We had to get rid of it for some reason when I was little and I remember being so upset. So now, at 20, I've bought myself a new copy and I'm SO excited to get it. It's such a ridiculous movie with ridiculous shenanigans. So anyone who likes ridiculous things and has a fondness of children's movies, you will LOVE this.",1477612800,,425,4.132530120481928
8027527,5,B0002F6AYI,My little niece loved it.  She really enjoyed thr pumpkins and the bumbling withes.,1477526400,,83,4.928571428571429
