2600508,4,B000G6BLCO,"Here we get two more 22 minute episodes, Shocker on Shock Street and Click, from the 90s Goosebumps TV series.

Erin Wright and her friend Marty are major fans of the Shocker on Shock Street horror movies. Erin's dad makes monsters for the Shocker Movie Studio. They are excited about trying out the new Shocker Studio's Tour Ride, but the monsters come to life.

In Click, Seth is lazy and spends countless hours watching TV. He receives a new futuristic-looking remote in the mail, but the remote doesn't just control the TV, it also controls people. Now he can pause anyone he wants to.

Don't expect fancy computer effects, all you get here is a low-budget, B-Movie quality special effects with below average acting. These are not the best episodes of Goosebumps, but kids will still like them.",1346457600,2,798,4.768115942028985

2600512,3,B000G6BLCO,"Both episodes (Shocker on Shock Street, Click) started off really good. The acting was surprisingly really good, but then...  The end of Shocker seemed to be going real well until the very last seen, when the acting turned terrible.

Click didn't acually seem like a normal goosebumps at first. It had a somewhat deep plot for being based off a short story, but again the last scene felt rushed.",1224374400,2,395,4.7101449275362315

He can be a jerk sometimes, but on the look of his face he is SOO ADORABLE:D One of my favorite parts about Marty is his CUTE Funny Clown Faces:D Since he is a robot. Of course, he did become a little bit evil at the and of the episode. But I still Love him no matter what:D By the way, The boy who plays Marty is Ben Cook:D And BEN WAS SOOOO CUTE as Marty:D AWW:D Im not sure why I love Ben Cook soo much?
