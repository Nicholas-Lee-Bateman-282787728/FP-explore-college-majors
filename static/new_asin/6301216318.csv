Well the answer is given about 25 mins into the film just after Patrick & Kate jump off the train they've hitched a ride on. Basically it means you've nowhere to stay for whatever reason & therefore you're sleeping rough (i.e. ""under the stars"" or ""at the Starlight Hotel"" - best place in town according to Patrick).

I first saw this film in the early 90s and fell in love with it! There is a long-lost beauty and innocence to this film which is very touching - helped by some breathtaking New Zealand scenery and some superb atmospheric music by Andrew Hagen & Philip Morton which really does enhance the 1930s depression era that the film is set in. It's unusual to hear music that is so evocative of the spirit of a film. I'd buy the soundtrack but it doesn't seem to have ever been released on CD! I guess it's because there isn't that much of it, but what there is, is used very effectively for creating mood and ambience.

Basically the film depicts the friendship that develops between Kate a 13-ish year old girl who's run away from home to look for her father and meets Patrick a late twenty-something who's on the run from the law after accidentally causing serious injury to a dodgy bailiff; and the film follows them on their many adventures during the 1930s economic depression and how their friendship develops while they're ""on the wag"". To me, where this film really scores highly is the way it portrays the spirit of the great Depression. There's an element of ""rites of passage"" in the film as well but it's kept very subtle and there's no nudity or anything suggestive like that (thankfully) and the film has an all-too-rare gentleness and innocence that is sadly lacking in most areas of life these days. This doesn't sound like there will be much to keep one interested, but this is far from the case!

Both principal actors play their parts very well indeed and a real chemistry seems to blossom between them.  Sadly, Greer Robson is an actress whose talent is all-too-rarely seen. A pity in my opinion as I think she showed real talent in this film.

There are some great dialogue moments: for instance when the two are walking along a road and a small lorry (pickup truck) deliberately ""buzzes"" Patrick & Kate, and a standoff ensues between Patrick the the two ruffians in the lorry. During said standoff Kate comes up to Patrick & says ""What's the matter Dad?"" To which Patrick replies ""these men are lost... and I've just told them where to go!"" Brilliant!

To anyone who enjoys the more aesthetic aspects of cinema & human relationships, this film is an absolute must!

Very highly recommended!",1138838400,6,2680,4.639240506329114
320507,5,6301216318,"This Sam Pillsbury film from New Zealand, starring Peter Phelps and Greer Robson, is a heartrending story of friendship and love. The two leads are truly magnificent. We don't realize how much we have come to care for these two souls in this quietly moving story until it is over, and we are left with a feeling in our hearts that stays with us a long time.

Young Patrick Dawson (Peter Phelps) is running from the New Zealand law for assualt on a reposseser. Dawson worked for the man until one night when he takes all the possesions back to the families they came from. This leads to a scuffle in which his boss is put into a coma. Flashbacks tell the backstory and we learn of Dawson's bitterness over the first world war, and disillusionment that the girl he loved married someone else while he was away.

Kate (Greer Robson) is a sweet, lonely young teenage girl who has lost her mother and runs away to find her father, who has gone to Wellington to find work. She meets Patrick and from the moment they are mistaken for family we know that the two will travel together. Kate slowly grows on him as a special bond is formed between the two dreamers.

The movie itself is dreamlike and compelling, and also romantic. Kate is only around thirteen, and as Patrick begins to care for her, they fight and argue as an older brother and younger sister would. But gradually she comes to mean more. We see just how much she means to him when he loses her in a riot and misses his ship to Australia in a desperate search to find her. He will risk his own freedom to save her. Another tender scene has Patrick taking flowers from another headstone for Kate to place on her mother's.

Robson is luminous and Phelps gives realism to the young yet world weary Patrick. They give memorable performances in a beautifully filmed story. Director Pillsbury shows the young couples' feelings changing, yet goes no further, allowing the viewer to imagine them in the future. A touching ending seems more like a beginning, the viewer aching to know what the future holds for Kate and Patrick. This is a tender film which holds a special place in the hearts of all who bothered to see it when it first came out. It may never make it to dvd, so don't wait a moment to see this very special film almost everyone missed. Check into the ""Starlight Hotel"" and enjoy this wonderful film for dreamers.....",1119830400,17,2381,4.4919168591224015
320508,5,6301216318,"This is no action film but a quiet, thoughtful story about two people, with beautiful New Zealand scenery as a backdrop. I even found and bought the book it was based on (""The Dream Monger"" -- I had to get it from New Zealand, it's out of print and absolutely no one else had it), in which Patrick actually teams up with a boy instead of a girl. The book was good, but the movie was definately improved by making Kate a girl.
I love the scenery, the slowly developing friendship, the sometimes embaressing and awkward moments, and the tenderness the war veteran finds himself showing. I could've done without some of the language but over all, liked this video very much and would recommend it to anyone with similar tastes.",990403200,7,724,4.534351145038168
320509,5,6301216318,"God bless Jen, for giving me this movie for Christmas. (She found it on eBay.) Starlight Hotel is magical. It is my ""official"" favorite movie. I have seen it countless times. The scenery... Patrick.... Kate... I melt into mush. Remember when he thought he lost her during the riot? Remember when she threw mud at him? Remember the ""goodbye to my mate""? So many scenes to endear these two outcasts to your inner-dreamer.  What are you waitng for! Find this movie and enrich your soul!",981763200,7,483,4.682352941176471
320510,5,6301216318,"In my review, I forgot to refer to another reviewer's comment that the movie has nothing to do with the title. The protagonist of the film is not well off financially and while on the run, spends the night outside beneath  the open sky in the ""Starlight Hotel"". One of my favorite films.",916444800,3,287,4.415094339622642
320511,5,6301216318,"As a 25 year old in 1987/1988 I spent six months living in New Zealand while training for Tack and Field competitions. It was a great experience. On one of my final nights in Aukland, I saw this film as it debuted in the  cinema. On the big screen, the cinematography was breath taking and it made  me teary eyed to be leaving New Zealand. The story of the film was a tender  one. The relationship that develops between the young man and the girl he  finds himself responsible for was really touching. I had hoped that there  would be a sequel that would explore a romantic relationship between the  two of them after the girl came of age. A film of subtle beauty for those  with sophisticated tastes.",916444800,6,701,4.387596899224806
7810311,5,6301216318,"This is among my top 5 favorites, and until now I could not find one. I love this movie! I've watched it 3 times since it arrived and will watch it again soon. If only it would come out as a DVD....Thank you so much for making it available!",1471651200,,240,3.9183673469387754
7810312,5,6301216318,"I have always loved this film. I loved the characters and the troubles they went through. The depression era is depicted well. But mostly it makes me crazy that whoever owns it hasn't restored it, and transferred to DVD. If it stays on VHS it's going to be lost forever. There are generations of Americans who would love to see this New Zealand film.",1468108800,,350,4.484375
7810313,4,6301216318,"This is one of my favorite films. The performances of the two actors is superb, and the skyline of New Zealand is so stunning, it is another player in the film. the story of the friendship between the runaway teen and the World War i vet with PTSD is touchingly told, and the viewer truly cares about them. A beautiful film. My only complaint is the DVD transfer. The source seems to have been an old VHS tape. The sound (yet another enchanting character of the film) is weak and scratchy, and the video kinda crummy. It's all that is available, though. So I guess I gotta just lump it. If it ever becomes available on Blu-ray, I'll get it. PAL format.",1425859200,,652,4.352459016393443
7810314,4,6301216318,A great  movie. Sadly its not a well known movie. But it is a hidden treasure of a movie. Its a shame its not on DVD . I would highly recomend this movie to anyone,1353024000,2,163,3.657142857142857
7810315,2,6301216318,It was said to be new but when it cane it had a sticker on the movie saying please rewind! when i put the tape in there was static very loud! Very disappointed  can i get a new one or replacement?,1335398400,,196,3.7804878048780486
7810316,5,6301216318,"I saw this film 25 years ago, loved it and never forgot it! So when I found out it was available to buy on vhs through Amazon, I had to have it! I was a bit wary because you see something as a child and it can be a totally different story when you see the same film as an adult, you sit and think to yourself 'Why did I like this so much, it's rubbish?!! Thankfully I still loved it and enjoyed watching it in peace and quiet with a cuppa, making a lovely afternoon for myself. :)",1327881600,,480,3.8585858585858586
7810317,5,6301216318,"Peter Phelps does a great job, as always (also recommend him in The Lighthorsemen). A lot of people have not heard of this film but it is well worth the watch.  It is a fine story, at times touching but not at all sappy.  One of my wife's favorites.",1327795200,,249,4.061224489795919
7810318,5,6301216318,"This is a lovely movie about the friendship of two complete strangers, a young teenage girl and a man in his twenties, who meet on the run and build closer bonds while getting to know each other. I love this romantic film since I have first seen it about twenty years ago and I can only recommend it.",1270252800,2,300,4.189655172413793
7810319,5,6301216318,"I first saw this movie some years ago and it's never left me. I just purchased it and viewed it again, and I still love it. The scenes I can't forget are two different times when Kate and Patrick are running from their pursuers and the twenty-something Patrick refuses to let go of 13 year old Kate's hand. He could easily flee without her, she so obviously slows him down, but he refuses to leave her, even to the point of picking her up in desperation and throwing her over his shoulder. For some reason, that does something indescribable to my heart. Other offbeat romantic movies I've loved have included The Princess Bride, Untamed Heart, Bram Stoker's Dracula (for one scene), Paradise, The Professional, and Out of Africa.",1253923200,2,729,4.703125
7810320,5,6301216318,"I can't add much more to the glowing reviews. Sometimes, a song or a movie just grabs your heart, and many years later, it's still there. Every time I watch ""Starlight Hotel,"" I fall in love all over again. What a simple but profound story with believable and endearing characters.  Like so many others, I wish it were available in DVD, but I recommend to anyone that you get this priceless movie any way you can.",1249689600,3,413,4.434210526315789
