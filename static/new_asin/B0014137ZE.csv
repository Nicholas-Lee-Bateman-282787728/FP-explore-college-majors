8253957,5,B0014137ZE,"I bought this video to learn how I could perform self-hypnosis (especially the induction techniques to help me get in a state of hypnosis), as well as understand hypnosis better; this video does exactly that. If you want a super-polished, high-quality studio production, then this ISN'T the video for you. If, however, you want a video that delivers top-quality content (which to me is MUCH more important than some fancy studio production), then this IS the video for you.

I found the techniques he demonstrates on the video quite useful--he goes over a number of different techniques anyone can use to induce hypnosis. He even had a very short session to guide you through getting into a hypnotic state, and he explains just what a hypnotic state is (in case you are wondering). His ""Myths of Hypnosis"" should also be carefully viewed, as I know MANY people when they hear the word, ""Hypnosis"" think of some controlled trance from a sinister hypnotist--he explains how this couldn't be further from the truth; how a person in hypnosis is in total control of their actions. He also references some free induction scripts on his website which I downloaded and found very useful.

I love using self-hypnosis, it really works well for me. I use it for stress relief and to help me sleep. This video gave me many more tools for using self-hypnosis daily in my life, which is exactly what I was looking for.",1358726400,,1404,4.773662551440329
8253958,2,B0014137ZE,Wasn't at all what was expected. Returned it even though the restocking fees were high. Definitely not worth the cost of this DVD.,1356393600,,130,4.695652173913044
