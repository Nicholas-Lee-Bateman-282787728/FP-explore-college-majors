6086883,4,B00GMM19M8,"I lived through the civil rights era of the 1960s and followed the stories of the Freedom Riders as well as watching the evening news as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted. I thought I knew much of the civil rights history of the South, until I watched this 54-minute documentary produced for Mississippi Public Television in 2013 (in partnership with a German film company) and now on David. It is based on the 2010 book by the same name by Rick Bowers.

As we learn from both interviews with various civil rights activists and former governors of Mississippi, after the landmark Brown v Mississippi Supreme Court ruling in 1956 the then Governor created the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a governmental unit that actually hired spies  both black and white  to infiltrate national civil rights groups to stop integration. They recorded the license plate numbers of those attending civil rights meetings and either published them in the newspapers or provided them to the Ku Klux Klan. The three activists  two white; one black  who were murdered in Philadelphia, MS were just a few of those murdered because of the work of the MSSC.  Even though the state government tried to destroy all the MSSC documents, they became available for inspection and many of these documents, plus archival footage are what tie the interview segments together.

The film isn't perfect and  at least for me  it ended too soon. We are made aware of the workings of the MSSC but not recent developments. Still, this film is a revelation to many and shows how far weve come in 50 years.  Its an important link in the history of civil rights and freedom in the US and this David should be in every public library and used as a resource for school curriculum.

There are no bonus features  only Scene Selections  on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6086940,5,B00GMM19M8,"Our age of conspiracy had its forebears.  This penetrating analysis of the intentional subverting, implanting of community ""moles"" within the black community and strategic ""counter-insurgency"" planning at the highest levels of the Mississippi government (including killing three civil rights workers along with Medgar Evers) is chilling - and damning of ""government for the people"".  It is a story that I was completely unaware of even though I lived through the era (the 1960s) and well worth the telling - not just to fill in an historical elision in the fight for black equal rights, but as a reminder of the need for constant vigilance as moral and ethical values evolve and the recalcitrant, intolerant and ignorant plan their revenge.",1412121600,,740,5.2100840336134455
6086941,4,B00GMM19M8,"What an eye-opening piece of American history.  Very well presented with interviews, newsreels and video.  Intriguing to the point where the names of the surprise collaborators are left until the end.  The only question left open for me is with all these attacks by Big Government Southern Democrats why did the subjects of the piece who entered politics elect to align themselves with the very party who victimized them?",1410393600,2,421,5.072463768115942

I have lived in MS for 18 years (born and raised) and this is the first time that I hearing about this commission. That alone is shameful. Like Mrs. Evers would say, how can we expect for the wound to heal if it is not cleaned out (or fully revealed).
