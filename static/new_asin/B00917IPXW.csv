8533842,5,B00917IPXW,A pair of classics.  Beautifully restored by Kino Classics and given the love they deserve.,1457136000,3,91,5.066666666666666
8533843,4,B00917IPXW,"This double bluray set includes ""The Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Strike"" at a cheaper price than buying "" Battleship Potemkin"" alone. Orson Wells was influenced by these movies and ""Citizen Kane"" has many ""ideas"" redone for it's visuals. Sergei Eisenstein was a true artist and really has influenced many directors style. If you like German impressionisic early cinema,you'll love this. If you are a film student,you'll learn alot from viewing these great old movies.",1449273600,3,465,5.383561643835616
8533844,5,B00917IPXW,"You have to see it to believe it. Outstanding restoration on two silent gems by Sergei Eisenstein, the great Soviet director. It's believed that Senator Joe McCarthy was pychologically-terrified by Eisenstein and his films up until his dying day (which, by the way, came about two BEFORE Eistenstein's equally same early death; Eisenstein of a heart attack while directing a film at 50, and  McCarthy of suspected alcoholism at 48.)

Enjoy both films, which ultimately celebrate the themes of labor and worker's rights.",1378944000,6,519,5.240963855421687
