2879272,2,B000S2B23E,"I purchased this collection for the added features of Jane Eyre that the previous DVD of this 2006 Masterpiece Theatre presentation lacked.  Otherwise, not sure I could even give it one star.  Admittedly, I've read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre several times but have never read Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. But, after viewing the DVD of this story, I would never want to.  Since when does selfishness and possessiveness pass for love?  That is not love.  Preventing a mother bird from feeding her babies is not love.  Hanging a dog is not love. If you want to watch a compelling and beautiful love story, stick to Jane Eyre and spare yourself the wretched and depressing story that is Wuthering Heights.",1224288000,14,708,4.907563025210084
2879273,5,B000S2B23E,"I had already purchased Jane Eyre, but I wanted this collection for the extras the first dvd didn't have.  It was well worth the price!!  My favorite Rochester had always been Orson Welles, with George C Scott a close second....they have both obliterated from my memory!!!!!!!  As a result of his performance, I have searched for and purchased 3 of Toby Stephens' other period films..Mangol Pandy, Sharpe's Challenge, and Tenant of Windfell Hall. Now to see him as Colonel Brandon or Mr Darcy!",1221523200,16,493,4.9156626506024095
2879274,5,B000S2B23E,"I bought both the Jane Eyre DVD and the Bronte Collection (which is the same Jane Eyre DVD and a version of Wuthering Heights).
I absolutely LOVED the Jane Eyre movie and it prompted me to read the classic which is so good.
I have also read the Wuthering Heights as well. However I did not enjoy either the Wuthering Heights DVD nor the book. Wuthering Heights is such a savage novel and very depressing. No redemption for the morally debase characters.
Jane Eyre however is so entralling, it is as if there are three wonderful stories in one book. It has so many twists and turns and it has romance, mystery, horror and it reflects some strong, uplifting characters. Despite Mr Rochester's dark past, I fell absolutely in Love with him!!! The Book is Fabulous and Toby Stephens is a SPLENDID, TOO-Handome, but absolutely WONDERFUL Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester. I watched the Jane Eyre DVD six times in one week. I have seen a couple other versions, BUT none as well done as this Masterpiece Theatre production with Toby!!!
Buy the DVD of Jane Eyre, forget about the Bronte collection, Wuthering Heights is not worth it.",1213747200,52,1119,4.685279187817259
2879275,5,B000S2B23E,"I already have the inital 2006 version of Jane Eyre with no extras so thought I could justify another purchase to get the commentary and star interviews. The truth is I wanted to see and hear more of Toby Stephens. Anyway, the interviews were quite good. The lead actors, director and writer all gave very interesting insights into their ideas for character and motivation. There is also running commentary on the first and fourth sections of the movie with all kinds of background info about locations, actor struggles, weather, you name it. Very entertaining except for the fact that my copy has the sound slightly out of synch for the movie running behind the commentary. I haven't watched Wuthering Heights yet but am disturbed by the other reviewer's remark of a rape by Heathcliff. Bottom line: extras or no extras, this is a GREAT movie with enough passion and heart to please anyone looking for a timeless story well told. The best version of Jane Eyre ever and Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester is sublime.",1212624000,79,1012,4.788571428571428
2879276,4,B000S2B23E,"These two movies are very well done and entertaining.  I purchased the set after seeing the first half of Jane Eyre on PBS, then not being able to see the second half---I didn't want to miss it! And I wasn't sorry.  If you are unfamiliar with the stories, beware, they are somewhat darker than your typical love stories.",1202428800,17,320,4.5

2879279,5,B000S2B23E,"I saw this version of Jane Eyre on television and absolutely loved it!  This is not a review of this movie, but a question.  Can anyone explain why the DVD of Jane Eyre only is so much more expensive than this set?  Given the reviews of Wuthering Heights, I'm not anxious to see it and would like to buy only Jane Eyre, but it costs substantially more.",1423267200,,352,4.223880597014926

2879285,4,B000S2B23E,I have reviewed Jane Eyre on that site.  Tried my best to look at Wuthering Heights and simply can't do it.  Just too dark and depressing. Jane Eyre got 4 stars.,1400371200,,161,4.161290322580645
2879286,5,B000S2B23E,"Wuthering Heights is a dreary and confusing tale that is well handled in this collection.

The real treasure here is Jane Eyre. I read this as a girl, and I've seen many different versions on the screen. None compare to this. The protagonists are not flat, stereotypical characters, as they are in previous versions. They shine forth as individuals with noble qualities and human frailties. Toby Stevens is a likable and believable Mr. Rochester, and Ruth Wilson is superb as a wise, insightful, strong yet vulnerable Jane Eyre. In addition to the acting and characterization, the scenery is stunning. It frames the scenes in such a way that you feel you have jumped into another century to observe these people's lives.",1396396800,3,720,4.950413223140496
2879287,4,B000S2B23E,Everything I ordered I have watched it already; This is an attempt to pass on my love of good literature to the next generation,1387756800,,127,4.333333333333333
2879288,5,B000S2B23E,"This is my FAVORITE version of Jane Eyre, I've watched the others and none come close for me. Comparing the book to this is much easier, its long enough to include a lot from the book. I just LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",1383523200,,211,4.3
2879289,5,B000S2B23E,"Not exactly true to the book, but a wonderful film.  After all, who would watch it if it had Jack Nicholson playing Rochester and Linda Hunt playing Jane?  Jane's early years are not strung out and the movie is continuous -- not broken up into sections as it was on PBS.",1379894400,,270,4.2745098039215685
2879290,4,B000S2B23E,"I got tired of waiting for Masterpiece Classics to replay this great production of Jane Eyre. Jane and Mr. Rochester's developing relationship from servant-master to equals is fascinating to watch. Could only wish for a bit more background development on Rochester's ill-fated first marriage and his wife's mental illness.

Having never read Wuthering Heights or seen another version of this Bronte work, I was looking forward to a similarly positive reaction as to Jane Eyre. It was not to be. Wuthering Heights turned out to be a study in mankind's worse traits. It has been put on the shelf with other films I can only view once.

I recommend buying this version of Jane Eyre separately if you can find it. If you're a fan of the darkest view of humanity buy the collection with Wuthering Heights.",1379462400,,800,4.8321167883211675
2879291,5,B000S2B23E,"I have to admit I haven't watched the Wuthering Heights in this collection because I've honestly just never liked the story. This version of Jane Eyre though is probably my favorite of all the Austen/Bronte period romances. Both the leads are amazing (I've fallen completely in love with Toby Steven's) and the script is beautifully written. The direction and cinematography is brilliant as well, making sure to balance the beauty of Thornfield Hall with its darkness and mystery.
  Ruth Wilson playing Jane is captivating to watch. She somehow goes from looking completely plain to ethereally beautiful with just a smile or turn of her head. She is a strong and moral person but also playful and passionate underneath which is clear in the book but usually lost or overshadowed in the adaptations I've seen before.
  Toby Stephens is equally brilliant as Mr Rochester even if he is too conventionally handsome to play the role. His Mr. Rochester is mischievous and inquisitive while still being the familiar brooding figure from other adaptations.
  Every scene between the two leads make it easy to see why they fall for each other. They challenge each other from the beginning and the banter between them is clever and electric. The chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is incredible and far more physical and raw than what is usually shown is such period romances. The longing between them is palpable and when Jane breaks down sobbing because she's left her love you believe every tear.
  I would recommend this version of Jane Eyre to anyone whether they've read the book and seen every adaptation or never even heard of it.",1359417600,7,1641,4.941818181818181
2879292,5,B000S2B23E,"Excellent set, cinematography, cast & script. Very well done. Varies from the book in dropping some characters, e.g. Mr. Lloyd (apothecary) at Gateshead, Miss Temple at Lowood,  casting a blond as Blanche Ingram, deleting Edward's disclosure of his mistresses, and inserting a novel heated bedroom scene. But the movie more than compensates for these liberties by adequately portraying the chemistry between Jane & Edward. This is the only version of Jane Eyre that really catches that to my satisfaction. I'm still waiting for a movie version with a proper St. John Rivers, but I think that might be beyond the bounds of reality to catch, needing a triumvirate of proper appearance, acting skill and appropriate script. William Hurt would have been a good choice at one time, but he was miscast as Edward (a blond Edward?!) But I digress. This version of Jane Eyre played by Ruth Wilson is exceedingly well done and worth purchasing.",1358294400,4,934,5.025806451612903
2879293,5,B000S2B23E,it's such a fantastic interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.  And Wuthering Heights is also good (except that I don't think I'll ever consider Catherine and Heathcliff as anything but selfish no matter if I'm watching the movie or reading the book).,1357948800,3,258,5.142857142857143
2879294,5,B000S2B23E,I've seen many versions of Jane Eyre but this was simply the best.  Ruth Wilson captured Jane's passion spot on and Toby Stephens was the perfect Rochester.  The movie followed the novel quite well - enough that I was satisfied.  It was riveting to watch - despite the fact that I've read and watched Jane Eyre numerous times - I was glued to the screen.  Don't miss this version - I don't think I've seen it's equal.,1336521600,6,417,4.376623376623376
2879295,5,B000S2B23E,"I love this version of Jane Eyre!  Ruth Wilson is perfect for Jane Eyre, and Toby Stephens is perfect for Mr. Rochester.  The young actress who plays Adele is very good, very believeable.  In fact, all the actors and actresses in this movie are just perfect for the parts they play.
The movie doesn't follow the book perfectly, but it is very well done anyway.  I like the additions of the more sensual scenes.  They are tastefully done and add a lot to the movie.
I have watched this movie several times now, and I imagine I will watch it many times more!",1333238400,9,556,4.359223300970874
2879296,5,B000S2B23E,"The Bronte Collection was a good find. Jane Eyre is very typical of that time period and heart warming to say the least, you can FEEL the emotions! Withering Heights was interesting, but not quite what I was expecting.  All in all two movies for the price of one.",1325203200,6,263,4.36734693877551
2879297,5,B000S2B23E,"Everyone involved in this production has contributed something bold.  This version succeeds with the modernized dialogue between the two leads because the actors never sound like they're reading from a script.  I have found that's a noticeable problem with other productions.  Wilson and Stephens' conversations on-screen are perfectly believable, and maybe that has a lot to do with the script.  So kudos to screenwriter Sandy Welch for that, and to the actors.

The most outstanding actors for the starring roles come together in this movie.  Toby Stephens gives Rochester an added dimension.  He portrays vulnerability through a sense of humor.  His subtlety in portraying emotion through his eyes is to be commended.  Of all the Janes, I've previously found myself irked at how an actress wouldn't show us Jane from the book.  Actresses have played Jane as too timid on the surface, thus covering the volcano of emotion and passion that's a part of Jane and cannot be concealed despite her self-control.  Never has an actress understood principled, passionate Jane like Ruth Wilson. Wilson and Stephens = the best individually and the best as a couple.  Passion is the theme throughout the movie.  Emotions and connections between passionate people are hard to believe without incredible acting.  I'm glad they cast Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens.  I'll always keep this DVD and enjoy it every time I watch.

I purchased this over the standard U.S. release is because it has deleted scenes, trailers, on-set interviews and commentary included.  Wuthering Heights is included. Sarah Smart and Matthew Macfadyen (Catherine and Hareton) were my favorite characters in this adaptation, but their scenes are all too short.",1309478400,42,1720,5.241758241758242
2879298,5,B000S2B23E,"These showed up 3 days before said date arrival and I've already watched Jane Eyre twice, it is a well done series though i wish they wouldn't have skipped most of the beginning details about Jane's childhood especially her defiant moment against Mrs. Reed before she leaves for Lowood.",1304553600,4,286,4.857142857142857
2879299,4,B000S2B23E,"This has got to be my favorite Jane Eyre. Even Timothy Dalton's Rochester was not as heartfelt. And Jane was just plain and pretty enough to be believable.
Wuthering Heights I'm not a big fan of, but this Heathcliff was a bit more creepy than most, I would say. Not much of a 'hero' if I can't work up any sympathy.",1303257600,8,315,4.180327868852459
2879300,5,B000S2B23E,"Loved this version of Jane Eyre!  Withering Heights was OK, still like the version with Sir Laurence Olivia best.",1302912000,2,113,4.947368421052632
2879301,3,B000S2B23E,"I can only rate this as a 3 star simply because the version of Wuthering Heights was disappointing. Jane Erye is absolutely wonderful and enjoy the ""extras"" that are included. I'm not convinced that the purchase was worth the ""extras."" I will never watch the Wuthering Heights again.",1301270400,4,283,4.916666666666667
2879302,5,B000S2B23E,"Jane Eyre: I absolutley loved this production of Jane Eyre by Masterpiece Theather. I have seen some other Jane Eyre productions, and this one is one of the best. The casting was excellent and there was a beatiful chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. There are some scenes that do not appear in the book, but they fit in the movie perfectly. Absolutely recommend it.

Wuthering Heights: Very dark and sad story, but very powerful at the same time. Great casting too and the characters were very passionate.

In conclusion: If you love powerful, romantic stories with some twists, you will definetly love this two stories.",1282953600,13,633,4.906542056074766
2879303,5,B000S2B23E,Enjoyed both Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.  This version of Jane Eyre is my favorite.,1279065600,5,88,4.866666666666666
2879304,5,B000S2B23E,"Of all the Jane Eyre movies I've seen, and I've seen them all, this is by far my favorite! Of course there are literary critics that can't see past having a movie rendition of a book be entirely literal. However, this movie version and its artistic license will send your senses longing for more at DVD's end. The casting was superb and this production was utterly marvelous!",1271894400,12,375,4.611940298507463
2879305,5,B000S2B23E,"It's different and wonderful.  The main actors are excellent.  It is so nice to see little flickers of communication, understanding, caring, and then the eventual love.  The facial expressions, the little exhales, and the eye-contact between Jane and Edward are very moving.  This is the best version I have seen and I have seen many.",1238457600,33,334,5.0181818181818185
2879306,5,B000S2B23E,"Charlotte Bronte's work is new to me and I'll be honest, I did not finish the book but I am ""in love"" with this story!  I don't know about it's trueness to the book and I'm sorry but that is not important to me. I am a romantic and this tops my list of romances. ""Jane Eyre"" is 4 hours long and I wanted more! It is fabulous acting with twists that I did not see coming.  I will watch this over and over. Now ""Wuthering Heights"" was not what I expected. A different love story that I am glad I got to see.  The passion is true but told in a dark sort of way. I can appreciate the classic that it is and do recommend it.",1228435200,8,619,3.8203125

8204091,5,B000S2B23E,"What's not to love?  Jane Eyre movie with excellent acting.  I've seen a lot of the other versions, including the one with Orson Welles, MIchael Fassbender, Timothy Dalton, Ciaran Hinds, and William Hurt, but the characters and the acting in this movie make it my favorite so far.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens have the chemistry to pull off the characters' love for each other.  Something I didn't get in some of the other versions.  I enjoyed it so much I bought the dvd.

I haven't watched this version of Wuthering Heights yet that came with the combo dvd but it will only be a bonus if it turns out to be as good as the Jane Eyre movie.  Even if it isn't, I feel it was worth getting this version of Jane Eyre.",1468713600,,716,4.298507462686567
8204092,5,B000S2B23E,"I plunked down the extra money to get this version for the brief deleted shots. I keep watching this program from time to time and it never gets old. I credit the performances of Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. Both have amazingly expressive faces. In Ruth's case she morphs from very plain to delightfully pretty with just the slightest change of expression. She did the same thing in the TV show ""The Affair"" so it's not a fluke. There are almost too many examples for Toby to name but stand-outs include the expression on his face looking up the stairs to Jane in her wedding dress, followed by his expression at the church that vividly captured  ""to Hell with God and man, I'm marrying this woman!"" Love it. I'm glad Toby seems to get plenty of acting jobs but none of his other roles really come close to this.

The only thing that gives me pause is the expense of this set and the stand-alone version. That's a shame if this keeps the movie out of the hands of people who would enjoy it.",1464307200,2,992,4.385869565217392

8204097,5,B000S2B23E,"During the Christmas holidays, I went on a Jane-Eyre binge, and in addition to re-reading the book, I watched every version that's out there to watch, all the way back to Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  At the end of it, this 2006 version, with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, remains, in my opinion, the BEST Jane Eyre adaptation onscreen and that particularly includes the most recent, dreadful big screen version with Michael Fassbender. (Why would anyone want to tell the story of Jane Eyre all chopped up in flashbacks?) Dear Reader, Toby Stephens IS Mr. Rochester, and he portrays him with the right blend of humor, humility -you really feel he gets Mr. Rochester's brokenness- and, of course, he's so easy to look at.  Ruth Wilson was very young in this role but I think, having watched a dozen Janes say, ""Do you think that because I'm poor, plain and little...."" and when she says it, sobbing, you believe it.  The music is wonderful, the scenery lush, and at a full four hours, there's plenty of time to richly tell the whole, wonderful story.  As for the DVD, I purchased it because I couldn't find this version on Amazon Instant Video or Netflix and wanted to be able to see it again and again.  There are a few cast interviews, director's comments thrown in, too. :)",1424649600,,1279,4.616740088105727

Don't waste money on less expensive versions.  I own a few, and none come CLOSE to the quality and mastery of the story as this approximately 4 hour presentation!

In addition, this item also has the classic story of Wuthering Heights, another masterpiece from the Bronte sisters.

This item is a treasure- the most $$$ I ever spent for a specific title, and well worth it~  :-)",1424563200,,555,4.7894736842105265
