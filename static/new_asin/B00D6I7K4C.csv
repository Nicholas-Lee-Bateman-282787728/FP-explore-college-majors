5775283,1,B00D6I7K4C,I gave it 1 star because I could give zero stars. Movie was a rip off & fined on a $100.00 budget. It was a complete rip off !!,1453852800,,127,3.413793103448276

5775286,1,B00D6I7K4C,"Let me just start by saying I freakin' LOVE the first Showgirls...how awesomely tacky & overacted it was made it so hilariously entertaining. I was hoping for the same with this one...not so much. Horrible quality, horrible acting, horrible story line...and at 2-1/2 hours long I couldn't even finish it. It was literally painful to watch. Sorry fans of the original Showgirls, but don't waste your time & money on this piece of crap. Just keep watching the first one & pretend like this sequel doesn't exist.",1403568000,15,509,4.862068965517241
5775287,5,B00D6I7K4C,"If you are a fan of the film Showgirls then this film is for YOU! I love Rena Riffel and her work in other pictures. Rena reminds me of  Marilyn Monroe with Sandra Bernhard's personality!  And I really respect RR for writing, directing and producing ""Pennies from Heaven"".  Which is no easy task! Many of the cast were in the first film. I am a huge fan of Grind House type pictures and this film falls into that category.  It's not for everybody. If you liked Patch Adams you won't enjoy ShowGirls 2.
 Penny (Rena Riffel) decides to leave VEGAS ""To became a BIG Moviestar in Hollywood"". She has many good and bad adventures. I hate when people write a review and spoil the ending, so I won't. It must be seen to be believed! Very entertaining! This film is going to be a cult classic!",1395532800,9,785,4.3493150684931505
5775288,1,B00D6I7K4C,"This movie was so horrible, it is actually CRAZY hard to even describe to other people!!! (& this is coming from a die-hard Showgirl's fan)  The original ""Showgirls"" was a bad film with good production value and an interesting cast, which made it an awesome/funny B-movie.  However, ""Showgirls 2"" is just terrible from the beginning to end!!!  The script is very awkward and basically steals all the known lines from the first film, and then adds some strange one-liners that (I guess) are suppose to seem witty.  The overall production quality is laughable, as are some of the locations, costumes and actors.  Plus the plot just twists and twists and twists, until you have no idea what you did wrong in your life to possibly lead you to buying and watching this movie!  o_O
I wish I could rate this without having to give a star! Honestly, I bet I could give an old hooker a cellphone to make a movie and her's would be far more enthralling...if not comical!  ;)",1393977600,5,964,4.60233918128655
5775289,3,B00D6I7K4C,"This secqueal doesnot live up to the first ""Showgirls"". It is ok but I for one was a bit disappointed. Oh well, you sometimes get a good thing with swcqueals and sometimes not. G.Goff",1387756800,,183,4.411764705882353
5775290,5,B00D6I7K4C,"Rena Riffel is an artist far ahead of her time. Her comic timing is impeccable, and directing style can only be described as David Lynch meets Andy Warhol. This is both camp and beyond camp... Hypnotic, jarring at times - especially the surreal storyline and dialogue. It manages to tease out the absurdity of the original in a loving, celebratory way. Also features a perfectly staged and executed dance sequence not to be missed. This is one of my favorite films and it only gets better with repeated viewings.",1386201600,7,512,4.764044943820225
5775291,1,B00D6I7K4C,This is the worst movie that I have ever seen.  Do not waste your money. This is nothing but a waste of time to watch and is nothing like the first SHOWGIRLS movie.,1380844800,5,164,3.9696969696969697

8589961,1,B00D6I7K4C,"This movie is complete trash, it's boring, uninteresting, a complete waste of money and time. Do not buy it. I give it a F as in failure. If I were one of the people who was in this fiasco, I would never show my face in Hollywood again.",1482192000,,236,3.9375

8589964,1,B00D6I7K4C,"This movie is not even close to the original. Returning cast member had
a major hand in producing, editing and directing. No experience in either.
That's why it's a slow moving, awkwardly sequenced and the acting beats
""Ishtar' as one of the worst movies made. Never made it to the movie screens
here and abroad. Straight to video!",1475452800,,331,4.724137931034483

8589968,1,B00D6I7K4C,"Don't waste your money on this, it should have never been made and it's 2 and a half hours of your life that you will never get back. It is painful to watch if you can make it all the way to the ending. This is something that can be given to someone as a gift to show that you really hate them. The first Show Girls movie was watchable, but there are no words to describe how awful the second movie is. :-(",1454544000,,406,3.8452380952380953
