8361358,2,B002BFX8N8,"I was hoping for actual, professional burlesque acts of several minutes each.  Instead, these were dozens of acts consisting of 10 seconds to a few minutes.  Most of them were just quick strips to bra, pasties or breasts.  Only a few of them seemed professional and entertaining.  A few of them were depressing to look at.  I even fast-forwarded through many because they were so bad.

At best, it's a well-preserved piece of history.  Also, it's an interesting glimpse into how women were oppressed to empowered (looking at their faces and acts) by participating in burlesque...or how burlesque could be interpreted as an artform (by those in it) to a self-shaming act of quick stripping (many looked embarrassed, while only a few looked to be enjoying and performing well).  Enjoy?  Not so much.",1309651200,7,797,4.932330827067669
