8108937,4,B000EFKGLO,"I enjoyed reading the books and the video series is basically a rehash of ""Weath Without Risk"" and ""Financial Self Defense"".  If you enjoy his books, the tapes are ok, as you can tell he is reading off of a teleprompter and was not a very dynamic speaker.  In any case the content he presents is very interesting and informative and if you hate reading, it is an alternative way to learn his strategies.  Personally, I liked the books better, but for the bargain price I paid the tapes were worth it.",1218585600,3,500,4.413043478260869
