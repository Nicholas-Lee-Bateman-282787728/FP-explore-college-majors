8121544,5,B000FESSNC,The quality of the DVD is good.  It gives clear instructions on how to perform the moves.  I don't compare dancers as everyone has his/her own styles. It's a pleasure to learn from the pros.  Tango is an improvised dance so I would learn from everyone. The DVD covers all the basics. Good buy.,1418688000,,293,4.388888888888889
8121545,5,B000FESSNC,"Please buy this dvd!  Gavito is a legend of tango who's dancing style was born out of the golden age tradition with just enough interesting additives from the late 60's when composers like Pugliese and Piazzola were making the music beautifully layered.  He teaches steps that I have never seen a teacher teach, which means they are usable at a milonga. Most teachers in my opinion teach performance tango and don't teach students how to move beautifully and connected to the music in their own space, with no intention of getting around the circle of dance as quickly as possible. You can languish in each step and if the milonga you are dancing at becomes congested you needn't worry about not moving forward.  You will be able to stay in your own circle and have the most beautiful time.  Not for the flashy minded tango dancer!  His moves are super subtle and the private conversation you will have with your partner in dancing will speak volumes-but only to you two.  If you look at his moves and his performance dancing it may not be thrilling to you(it is to me to the point of weeping and beaming)but when you do those steps he does it is very exciting.  Don't take my word!  Please buy this! Beginner or advanced!  It will change your tango life for the better forever.",1351296000,3,1278,4.5701754385964914
8121546,5,B000FESSNC,"I agree with the other reviewer on this page, the one that writes about Javier Rodriguez. We agree: he is a fabulous dancer. That's all we agree upon. To give Carlos Gavito 2-stars out of 5 is an insult that betrays the reviewer's ignorance of the history of tango. We are talking about different generations; different styles! When we compare these two dancers we should remember that Gavito is pure 'salon', and he has his very own style, a world-wide recognized style that is 'Gavito'; a style that is of The Golden Age (for more on Golden Age tango and how it influenced the new styles of tango see the excellent book on the history of tango by a woman who knew these men :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Meaning-of-Tango-The-Story-of-the-Argentinian-Dance/dp/1906032165/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Meaning of Tango: The Story of the Argentinian Dance</a>. Carlos Gavito's style is based upon Golden Age 'salon' technique, that was danced in the 1940's and 1950's, until tango was banned by the fascists.  Javier Rodriguez is of the 'stilo milonguero' style, a new tango style that developed from a point in time somewhere during the re-birth of social tango in the early 1990's, some 10 years after Thatcher helped rid the world of the Argentine Junta; a clearance that helped tango to be re-born, first on the world stage, then in clubs. Rodriguez's style, though new, though divorced from Golden Age tango by 40 years, is still based in the techniques of 'salon' but it has a rigid code - a code that gets passed-on to dancers who learn from teachers within that style - and it disdains difference among tango dancers! Once upon a time,  as Puppi Castello, another great Golden Age dancer, may be paraphrased as saying, ""... [in my day] every tango dancer had his own style but today they are all xerox copies of the new teachers"" (see the excellent tango resource [[ASIN:1569802203 Paul Pellicoro on Tango] for more on what tango greats of yesteryear have to say about what they think]. Many proponents of 'Stilo Milonguero' style tango, as danced by Javier Rodriguez, pretend that it is THE one, THE original, THE true tango, whereas, even Javier Rodriguez, king of this style, would surely admit that he and others of his generation would not be dancing tango were it not for true tango greats of The Golden Age, like Carlos Gavito, like Puppi Castello, and the rest. We should remember that every couple dancing tango should be doing something a little different to each other couple who are dancing during a milonga. Sadly many people who have copied  Javier Rodriguez's style have missed the point. They try to be Javier Rodriguez and tell others in tango that  Javier Rodriguez's style is the original and best. It is neither, though he is a brilliant dancer! Carlos Gavito's instructional DVDs will open possibilities you never dreamed were possible! I fully recommend them, this one and volumes 1 and 3. PRICELESS and my top DVDs (along with the excellent Christy Cote and George Garcia series) of a collection of over 50 tango DVDs that I own.",1287532800,7,3111,5.011605415860735
8121547,2,B000FESSNC,"I saw Gavito on ""You Tube"" when he was younger so I ordered this video. It's entirely in Spanish. There is too much talking (in Spanish) and his demos are short. He has an unusual way of dancing, and his movements are jerky. For example, he demonstrates the Carpa, the tent, in which both partners lean against each other, in a 40 degree angle. This is very difficult for most tango dancers, as the preferred method is for the male to support the female, as she leans forward. ""The Sandwich"" is another example of a very difficult way to do a simple step. In this video he is quite old. There are two scenes of them dancing in a club environment, but his dancing is not as good as Javier Rodriguez, whom I consider tops. I don't suggest buying this video.",1266019200,3,755,4.361702127659575
