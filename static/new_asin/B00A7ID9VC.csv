8547882,5,B00A7ID9VC,"I would reccomend this DVD to anyone who gardens, or just wants to chase away the Winter blues.  It is a very soothing and relaxing tour thru 3 seasons in a Maine country garden.  The music adds to the charm of this DVD.  It's my idea of a heavenly perfect garden.  The photographer has done a wonderful job at showing this garden at it's best during Spring, Summer and Fall.",1359936000,,375,4.314285714285714
