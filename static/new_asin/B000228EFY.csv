8020334,1,B000228EFY,BUYING 1-7 Is only 100 bucks more and it comes with twice the episodes this does. AND ALSO IF YOU BUY THEM SEPRTELY IT COSTS LESS!,1111795200,2,130,4.038461538461538
8020335,5,B000228EFY,"I was a horrible original series snob, so much that I refused to watch any of the later series when they were on TV.  It wasn't until the series began coming out on DVD that I began to watch them.  I quickly became a TNG fan, then DS9, and now Voyager.  I can not say that one series is better than another, they are all great in their own ways.  If I could go back in time, there is only one change I would make to Voyager; I think Kate Mulgrew is an excellent actress, BUT, I would beg her to stop her infernal wispering of her lines.  She does it several times a show and the sound of it drives me up the wall.  OK, I've got it off my chest, so I can go back to enjoying the show, except for her wispering.",1089417600,,709,3.8551724137931034
8020336,2,B000228EFY,"What exactly are we getting for an extra 55 Bucks?  If you buy them seperately, it's about $295.  And the set is over $350?  That must be some great packaging, since seperately the case is far less superior than the two other series. (DS9 and TNG).  The show and extras are definitely a must have, but for this kind of money, I want to eat my cake too.",1089158400,4,352,4.132352941176471
8020337,3,B000228EFY,"I'm hoping this set is not nicer than the individual sets. If I had known that they were going to do this, I might have waited and bought them together to get a nicer box (if that's what they are doing here).",1086393600,,208,3.9761904761904763
