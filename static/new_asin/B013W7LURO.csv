7374193,4,B013W7LURO,"A poignant turn in Ethan Hawke's career. This is good film. He redeems himself for having subjected us to ""Before Sunrise"" and his playing of himself in ""Reality Bites"". If this is a sign of things to come, Hawke is catching his stride as an artist. I would expect to see more integrity in his acting from this point on. As for Seymour Bernstein and the content of the film, apart from the man's mis-quoting the Bible, and confusing his inner monologue with Almighty God, he is a brilliant artist with many good things to say. He is faithful as an educator and artist to express in sound expression the necessity of craft and the collaboration of all the genres of life.",1448150400,,670,4.5

7374199,4,B013W7LURO,"Seymour: An Introduction,"" directed by Ethan Hawke, is a profile of pianist/composer/teacher Seymour Bernstein. The documentary shows Bernstein instructing his students and sharing insights based on his long history as a professional musician. We see him in his native habitat  a cluttered New York City apartment with a piano in one corner, where he has lived for 57 years. His students share the bench with him as they practice Chopin and Schubert. Occasionally, he takes their hands and guides them over the keys to impart a helpful technique.

The movie doesnt go into extensive biographical background. Its strength is focusing on the man whose wisdom comes from long life experience, common sense, and love of music. Hawke does inform us that Bernstein was in the army during the Korean War and performed in a classical trio for his fellow soldiers. He turned to teaching full time in the 1950s and lived for a time in London. He was once the protege of a wealthy patroness who lavished him with adoration and material gifts in her mansion. He had to overcome stage fright during his years as concert pianist.

Hawke met Bernstein at a dinner party and was inspired to make this film. Bernstein is the antithesis of the monstrous music teacher played by J.K. Simmons in Whiplash. Movies about teachers generally portray them as saints or deeply flawed, but seldom realistically, as shown here. Soft-spoken and tender with his students, Bernstein is a master instructor who never raises his voice, loses patience, or has temper tantrums. Maestro Bernstein shares two valued gifts with his students: his love of music and his ability to explain verbally the transcendent effect of music.

Special features include footage of Seymour Bernstein in concert, and a trailer.",1446336000,17,1773,5.061643835616438

Seymour Bernstein is a celebrated musician who performed in major venues to great acclaim. At fifty, due to stage fright and other anxieties, he stopped performing and has been teaching, composing, and writing.  Seymour is a gifted and passionate man, but the film rambles with short piece-meal clips of his early career, teaching students, and his views of his life and the creative process.  It was a ""nice"" movie, but nothing terribly provocative or illuminating and not much piano playing.  Interesting, but it was a bit of a bore. For something a bit more interesting you might try the Chinese pianist Nobuyuki Tsujii",1470096000,4,692,4.897435897435898

When I first saw it, I wanted to see it over right then.  I managed to wait until the next day.  I plan to see it yet again before too long.",1468368000,,339,4.029850746268656
7374226,5,B013W7LURO,"Ethan Hawke met Seymour Bernstein at a dinner party one evening. Hawke, who admits that he suffered from ""crippling stage fright,"" forged a connection with Seymour. The older man became a valued friend and trusted mentor. Bernstein also had stage fright when he was an acclaimed concert pianist. In fact, he abruptly quit playing in public when he was fifty, and has since spent his time teaching music, composing, and writing. Blessed with a wonderful sense of humor, Seymour once quipped, ""Most artists are not nervous enough.""

""Seymour: An Introduction,"" directed by Ethan Hawke, is an inspiring documentary about an extraordinary man who is still going strong at eighty-nine. Seymour has a melodious and resonant voice and speaks with impeccable diction. He tells fascinating anecdotes, including one about his patroness, Mildred Boos. She was so taken with Seymour that she gave him the keys to a magnificent home and showered him with gifts. He found her attention and generosity stifling and decided that a life of luxury was not for him.

The most touching scenes are those in which Seymour instructs his students, not just on proper technique and the mastery of a particular piece, but also on how to move one's listeners. Seymour insists, ""The most important thing is to inspire an emotional response."" That is what Hawke does in this wonderful film. We are drawn to Seymour for so many reasons: the twinkle in his eye; his self-deprecating humor; his storytelling; the bond he establishes with his students; his love for and appreciation of classical music; and his wisdom. The bonus features show Seymour playing the piano for a select audience. He sits near a window overlooking a street in New York City, with buses, trucks, and pedestrians passing by. After the concert, Hawke and Bernstein walk out together, their arms tightly clasped around one another.",1466985600,,1872,5.074675324675325
7374227,5,B013W7LURO,"Thank you Seymour for showing  how a true artist and compassionate person can be combined into one amazing spirit!
Your gentle yet precise teaching manner is a gift to your students. This magnificent film led me to your book Play Life More Beautifully which along with your movie, is now my ""go to"" present for friends. Who could ask for anything more! Thank you!",1466899200,,363,4.671875
7374228,5,B013W7LURO,"Surprisingly great movie, it earned a spot in my collection!",1466899200,,60,5.1
7374229,5,B013W7LURO,"About five years ago, my piano teacher recommended Seymour Bernstein's book, ""With Your Own Two Hands"" to her adult students. I read the book and reviewed it on Amazon.  Then, just last week, my current piano teacher mentioned the book to me as something I could learn from. It is impossible to absorb fully all Bernstein's book has to teach at a single reading; and my teacher's suggestion reminded me about how much I enjoyed the book. He also mentioned to me this film, ""Seymour: an Introduction"" directed by Ethan Hawke which played in a theater showing independent film last year, but which I didn't have the opportunity to see.  (My teacher hasn't seen it yet either.)  I took the opportunity to watch it here on Amazon.

One of the most endearing things about ""With Your Own Two Hands"" was Bernstein's feeling for serious amateur musicians.  He wrote:

""Stimulated at the mere thought of turning a musical phrase with control and artistry, they approach their practicing with a religious fervor and a childlike enthusiasm born of an unconditional love. No one forces them to practice; they are drawn to it. Their lives, they admit unashamedly, would be meaningless without music. Such people, though they may be highly accomplished in their chosen fields, are in truth among the most devoted servants of music. It is they who dignify the status of amateurism."" (p. 283)

Much of Hawke's documentary can be read as an expansion of Bernstein's thoughts about amateur musicians.  In the film, Bernstein again praises amateurs for their pursuit of music out of love rather than from careerism.  More importantly, Bernstein speaks at length about the need to approach music whole heartedly from love and to emphasize the emotions in learning a work of music over the intellect and over considerations of formal structure, important as they may be.  Bernstein describes how giving oneself to music is one way to committing oneself to a meaningful life.

Bernstein's own long life, (he is in his mid-80s), shows his own growing sense of an emotional commitment to music. As shown in the film, Bernstein had a successful concert career until the age of 50 and then suddenly gave it up due to a combination of nervousness over performing in public and a dislike of the commercial aspects of professional music.  Bernstein, who has lived in the same New York City apartment for over 50 years, devoted himself to teaching, writing and composition.  Without the large following of a concert pianist, Bernstein has instilled a love of music in his students and in the many people with whom he has come in contact more than on the stage. Hawke asks Bernstein several times during the film whether he might have given up too much in leaving the concert stage and the ability to communicate music to a large audience.  Bernstein's reply is that he has passed music along through his students and through his own devotion to the art.

The film includes beautiful music by Schubert, Beethoven, Scarlatti, Schumann, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, among others, performed both by Bernstein and by students. The film also cuts away to musicians as different as the Beatles and Mahalia Jackson to stress the emotive, or what Bernstein calls at one point the ""ecstatic"", mystical quality of music and its ability to move the heart.  He states that the greatest gift a music teacher can give a student is a sense of feeling and emotion in music and life, a quality which is all---too---rare.

I watched this film as a spur to my own efforts and to prepare for a piano festival I am attending this summer.  It is a moving film about a great teacher and pianist.  It reinforced my love of music and the piano.

7374230,4,B013W7LURO,"While the insights into Seymour Bernstein's life and work as an artist and teacher were beautifully told, the production lacked in the directorial department. Ethan Hawke, who clearly loved his subject, never made the necessary comparisons of his and Bernstein's careers that would have shed important light on the creative process of any type of artist. He also inserted way too many ""filler"" shots that served no purpose to advance the story. I came away feeling that there was something very fundamental lacking in the film.",1465948800,,527,5.1395348837209305

7374267,5,B013W7LURO,"This was one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  The content was in concert with the subject matter, and the analysis of the creative process was comprehensive, intuitive and as sensitive a treatment of a complex subject as one could hope for.  I have sent copies to two of my grand daughters who are following artistic endeavors, and they both were effusive in their praise of the presentation and its execution and thanked me for an eye opening investigation into the creative process.",1453852800,3,496,4.823529411764706
7374268,3,B013W7LURO,"Not as good as Rotten Tomatoes Meta reviews would lead me to expect. It's possible I missed exactly what it was trying to say, but I didn't find it to have anything to say specifically.  I thought there might be some more over arching theme regarding the relationship of music to the brain/soul, creativity, performance and preparation or teaching. Instead it was a nice documentary about a relatively interesting, gifted and passionate man.",1453680000,,441,5.041095890410959

7374274,4,B013W7LURO,"This film is a tribute to Seymour Bernstein, a native New Yorker and pianist extraordinaire, who, despite rave reviews, gave up the life of a concert pianist due to stage fright. Instead, he  turned to teaching others how to play the piano. He met Ethan Hawke at a dinner party  and when they spoke, what Seymour said to Ethan resonated powerfully with him. So much so, that Ethan later directed this film so that other might know Seymour as he did. So, this film is a bit of an indulgence  but is, nevertheless, an interesting, birds-eye view into a very talented man and his views on music, life, and the creative process.",1453420800,,624,4.553571428571429

8729031,5,B013W7LURO,"I'm a big Ethan Hawke fan. Not just of his acting but of who he is as a person. If you've had the pleasure of listening to him in long-form interviews you know that he's intelligent, sensitive and possesses hard-won wisdom as an artist. Seymour's musings on his art are the same as any other artist. The way it begins to shape your life. His attention to detail and understanding of the various minutiae of piano-playing is both impressive and engrossing. We are affected by passion, because it is pure and unadulterated. It is a lesson for any artist. Fall in love with what you do. Keep it unpolluted by ego and fame and money. There is a real pleasure in seeing someone enamored with what they love to do. And, of course, the true pleasure is finding that for oneself.",1499904000,,771,4.475177304964539
