2168531,3,B000654YIS,"Well, I bought this movie for some unknown reason.  I guess I didn't have enough cheese in my diet.  Casper Van Dien (The king of B- Horror movies) is Capt. Van Helsing (sound familiar?) who is transporting cargo from the planet of Transylvania.  Is this planet anywhere near Transexual?  Maybe not, but Frank-N-Furter would have been more realistic than Coolio's stoner performance as 187.  Ay,Ay,Ay!  Resembling a low budget ""Jason X""  good ole Drac is biting people in space.  I guess his reasoning is there is no sunshine in space. Well, there is some suspense and a few chills.  The film isn't without some merit.

2168532,2,B000654YIS,"This is a horrible movie, don't buy it. Rent if your a sci-fi curioso and can't resist, but otherwise there is no reason to see this movie. The Story though, could have been on to something, which is why I viewed in the first place.

So you Producers out there: if your going to make a movie like this, give the 20thousand to charity instead and take the write-off. And spend some real money on the development of a Vampire Planet. You will engulf TWO markets in one, the headsucker wannabes and trekkies. Eh?",1102377600,11,509,4.414893617021277

The ""chunky blond"" referred to is ex-Playboy Playmate Erika Eleniak, who looks like she's spent the last 15 years since her centerfold eating chocolates by the ton. The ending? Geez, dull and unimaginative!

2168534,1,B000654YIS,"I should have known better. First warning - this movie is a Lion's Gate film; the shlock-miesters of the new century. Second - Casper Van Dien, the new Wings Houser, stars in this mess. Third - five minutes into the film, I noticed that someone uncrated the old spaceship from the old ""Space Rangers"" TV show (In was on CBS for about 1 season) to use in this film.

Uh-Oh.

It gets worse. Rapper Coolio is also in this train-wreck and boy is he bad; really hamming it up. The story centers around Dracula and his blood sucking buddies migrating from a planet called ""Transylvania"" (groan) in the ""Carpathian star system"" (egads!). Captian Van Helsing (Casper) and his crew of space salvagers come across Drac's crippled ship 50 years later. By now only Drac is ""alive"" on the ship and he proceeds to ineptly attack Van Helsing's crew.

This still would have worked as a film if:

a. it was scary or tried to be scary at least once.

b. the film had a budget greater than $50.

c. the guy who played Dracula wasn't an awful actor.

d. had some more racy scenes with the chunky blonde (she is the reason for the 1 star in my 1 star rating).

e. the other woman in the film had plastic surgery BEFORE she started working on this film.

The worst thing: the way the film ended; it looks like the producer just said ""No More! End it!"".

This is the worst attempt at film making that I have seen in 15 years.",1102032000,5,1402,4.316793893129771
2168535,1,B000654YIS,"I really wanted to Enjoy this, even after finding out that it was not the Final chapter in the Dracula 2000 trilogy.  So then I sat down to watch this and I was bored to tears at how attrocious this movie was.

The plot is that Udo Kier's transport ship made a stop to Planet Transylvania to pick up an urgent Cargo.  The cargo was a bunch of coffins of which one contained Dracula.  Flash forward 50 years later and now a salvage ship run by Captain Van Helsing (Casper Van Dein) finds it and decides to tow it to earth.  However a mishap happens when 187 (Coolio) accidently cuts himself freeing Dracula.  From there, if you get that far, hell breaks loose but in a very dull and piss poor manner.

There are many areas to complain about this.  First off is Dracula, the actor who plays him sucks.  He is not the seductive blood sucker we all know and love, instead he is this flat as a board actor trying to immitate those who did so much better.  Further ripping on Dracula hear includes the fact that despite being set in the deep future, Dracula still wheres a Black Tux with cape and puffy shirts.

The second is that you really don't care about any of the crew.  There are times you just wish one of the actresses would get naked just so that something interesting would happen.  It's sad when the most entertaining actor in the whole movie is Coolio, and even then you want to shoot yourself for watching this.

2168574,3,B000654YIS,"Watched this really bad B movie late last night titled Dracula 3000 and with a name like that I guess that it should have tipped me off to just how abysmal it was going to be but this movie really surprised me with just how terrible it truly is. It's a low budget schlocky mess of a movie that makes the Friday the 13th Jason-in-outer-space flick ""Jason X"" look like a sci fi horror masterpiece by comparison!

Casper Van Dien stars as Captain Van Helsing who is the leader of a crew aboard a salvage ship that finds a huge seemingly abandoned space vessel which upon further inspection they discover contains a bunch of old fashioned wooden coffins straight out of an old Hammer horror movie. Upon further inspection of one of the coffins, one of the crew members, played by Coolio, accidentally cuts his hand and ends up spilling his blood onto the sand laying at the bottom of the coffin which soon awakens the evil vampire Count Orlock! Dunn, dunn, dunn, DUNN! Soon enough Coolio himself is turned into a blood-sucking vampire, and let me tell you, there are not many things more absurd or funnier in this world than to see a vampire Coolio hamming it up for the cameras!

And Count Orlock looks like something straight out of a grade Z vampire flick dressed in traditional vampire garb with flowing cape and all. It's hilarious just watching him run around trying to bite people on the neck on this space ship that is supposed to be hundreds of years in the future. Which, the ship's interiors itself basically look more like a cheap set than an actual space ship from the far off future.

This movie is a so-bad-that-it's-good gem for those of you out there who delight in this sort of thing, so don't miss it. Or not? I give it two wooden stakes up.",1440115200,,1756,4.48125

2168591,3,B000654YIS,"DRACULA 3000

Have you ever came across a movie and thought ""I must own that"" based on the title alone. Well for me this is one of those flicks, actually one of many movies I purchased based on that concept. With a title like that how could I not get it, plus it had Coolio and Tiny Lister in it. Now regardless of the title it is in no way connected to the Wes Craven franchise that had the 2000 title on it. Plus like I said Coolio is in it.

The year is 3000 and a ship called Mother is on its way to a much larger vessel called Demeter. It has been on its way to Earth for a very long time and this group is there to investigate. Little do they know that the cause of the ships trouble from years and years ago still lies in wait. The crew boards the other ship and look around only to have their own ship take off seemingly on its own. But a creature from long ago is on board with them and it is hungry.

This in all honesty is not a great movie and by all means is a bad one, but that is why I like it. I am a big fan of these types of flicks which of course many cal B movies. The script here from Ivan Milborrow and director Darrell Roodt seems like it started out as a good idea, Dracula in space sounds good to me. But things don't come together like I am sure they wanted it to. Everything about this flick screams low budget including the acting for the most part. Coolio is funny and at times I am not sure he was meant to be and Langley Kirkwood seems like he didn't even want to be there.

Erika Eleniak seems like she was trying [I still can't figure out how she got all the info she got from Orlock/Dracula] as was everyone else I guess but only Lister seemed straight up good in this. Casper Van Dien looks like he doesn't care at times as the future Van Hellsing. The thing is I have seen better from everyone involved from the director to the actors. So that was a bit of a letdown but that brings me to my biggest complaint here, what was with that ending. Watch this flick I tell me if that ending came from nowhere as if they just gave up on it or something. Sadly even with that I still kinda enjoyed it even with my brother's MST3K like commentary throughout the flick.",1383004800,2,2195,3.9931662870159452

2168593,1,B000654YIS,"Have you ever seen a movie so bad that it warps space and time, tears a hole in the universe itself and rapes the very concept of cinematic quality?

I have. It's called ""Dracula 3000."" And while (sadly) it is not the worst movie ever made, it is definitely the worst VAMPIRE movie ever made -- a witless, crass, ugly, derivative pile of foul sludge that plagiarizes ""Alien"" and ""Dracula"" in equal measure, with spectacularly awful acting and a total budget of about $6.34.

The salvage spaceship Mother III comes across the derelict ship Demeter (whose name will cause Bram Stoker fans to weep). Captain van Helsing (Casper Van Dien) immediately takes the entire crew onto the Demeter, whose crew is all dead -- and which is piloted by a corpse who tied himself to his chair, covered in now-illegal crosses. But surprise surprise, they end up stranded on a dead ship.

To make matters worse, there's a bunch of coffins in the cargo hold, and resident stoner 187 (Coolio) accidentally drips some blood onto the pile of dust inside one.

Next thing we know, 187 has been attacked by a vampire, and promptly sprouts fangs. Vice Captain Aurora Ash (Erika Eleniak) conveniently gets the vampire's life story, and reveals that the evil Count Orlok (Langley Kirkwood) is from a planet of vampires (how... does that work?) and now he wants to get to Earth... for some reason. It's never really explained very well.

I could write a graduate thesis about all the ways that ""Dracula 3000"" fails as a movie. The budget is below Z-grade (the ""space suits"" are scuba masks), the direction is dodgy and aimless, it was clearly filmed in an old factory, and the script is completely devoid of logic. What are the chances that in a thousand years, people will still be using the same racial slang as today?!

I can only assume that the screenwriter was high on paint thinner when he wrote this, because it's simply tragic to imagine that a sober person wrote Coolio's lines about his ""anaconda"" -- most of the dialogue is unfunny sex jokes or griping. And the director seems to be just as high, since he inserts random close-ups and visual effects that will make you goggle in amazement. It is almost like a professional primer on what NOT to do in filmmaking.

But leaving aside the horrendous quality of EVERYTHING... well, the plot is ""Alien"" with vampires. The plot is pretty much a blatant rip-off, except with people being turned into vampires instead of chestburster incubators. Even the android ""twist"" is stolen.

By the halfway point of the movie, I was practically rocking in the fetal position, thinking, ""END! END! END, FOR THE LOVE OF NOSFERATU!"" But even when it does end, the pain does not. It feels like they simply ran out of story and characters, so they simply slapped together one more crass sex joke and a bad video-game explosion.

It's also rather racist -- the only non-white individuals are depicted as a lecherous comical stoner and a cowardly, thuggish idiot, both of whom treat women horribly and lust after the hot blonde. Interpret that as you will.

Good acting wouldn't have salvaged this turkey, but might have made it slightly less painful to watch. Van Dien and Eleniak have the appearance and acting ability of Ken and Barbie dolls, and Tom ""Tiny"" Lister merely serves as a violent meatheaded thug who does one hopelessly moronic thing after another. The worst performance: Coolio, who whoops and dances around as if he's suffering some sort of peculiar brain damage.

""Dracula 3000"" is revolting. It is a movie so horrendous that it cannot even be used for a drinking game, because anyone who tries will be dead of alcohol poisoning by the second act. Avoid this with extreme prejudice.",1364342400,2,3709,4.761682242990654

2168599,1,B000654YIS,"...if you enjoy the worst movies ever made. As someone who enjoyed Manos: Hands of Fate, Monster a-Go Go, and Shark Attack 3, I recommend this film. Here are some important bullet points:

-A large majority of the dialogue comes from either Coolio or Tiny Lester (known as the president in The Fifth Element or the scary prisoner in The Dark Knight, or as a WWF wrestler, or as a bad guy in Friday)
-The other stars are Casper van Dien and Erika Eleniak, a 1989 Playboy playmate (this movie is indeed from 2004) and Baywatch star
-This movie takes place in the Carpathian galaxy, and the vampires come from the planet Transylvania. Those are among the more subtle ""nods"" to Stoker's Dracula, despite the fact that
-The damn head vampire is not actually named Dracula!
-It features the most walking around corridors you'll see this year, or probably any year
-Apparently this vessel (in the year 3000) is a Soviet vessel
-It turns out Van Helsing was actually not the worst vampire movie focused around someone named Van Helsing that came out in 2004

Everything about this movie is bad. The main parts that loop back around to ""funny as hell"" are the silliness of Tiny and the amazing overacting of Coolio, but actually every single part is pretty terrible. Nothing needs said about the acting. The plot stops making sense as soon as Udo Kier starts talking (he's the first to speak). The cinematography is impressively bad. The special effects are fairly impressive for 1980. Even silly things are bad - the air is safe to breathe because it's 87% oxygen (that's rather deadly). This is pretty impressively bad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it takes the title of worst film of this millennium from Battlefield Earth, if only because Battlefield Earth was released in theaters, actually cost money to make, and starred some Hollywood actors.

Not the most exciting thrill-ride of a conclusion, but you could at least understand the motivation, because, really, who wants to go through life with an Evil Emperor and all his Minions constantly trying to kill you?

The ""conclusion"" to Dracula 3000 isn't quite that deep.  In fact, it's not a conclusion at all.  The movie just ends.  It kind of ends with a shrug.

2168607,2,B000654YIS,"I got a copy of this from a friend who got a kick out of it, so I decided to check it out. I really didn't expect much, as this type of story has been done to death and beyond. But, in all honesty, when something like this comes out, it's almost as if some producer has gobs of money to throw away, so they throw a bunch of disparate ideas together, assemble some actors and special effects people and let it fly.

The first thing I thought of when the movie started, was '...this idea has already been done, look at ""Jason X""...' But, since just about everything is derivative of something else, I went on ahead. I expected a vampire story, but the ""3000"" in the title implied a futuristic setting. In the aforementioned ""Jason"" movie, a 20th century villian is projected far into the future, and save for some funny dialogue, it is an inane (not ""insane,"" but inane; silly) premise, one that doesn't work. Here, a man named Van Helsing, who knows nothing about the vampire legend, is singled out by Count Orlock in a personal vendetta. This strains credibility, because in the original Brahm Stoker story, Van Helsing was his rival back then, as well. I think if my name were Van Helsing, I would have a clue when a person on my crew is found in an altered state, with bite marks on his neck. But I give kudos to the writers using the ""Orlock"" name in the script, because that is the alternate name for the vampire when F.W. Murneau directed ""Nosferatu"" way back in 1922. I have this on VHS, and it is superior to many of its namesakes in every way, particularly this updated train wreck. I will try not to make this a ""Nosferatu"" review, but some things have to be clarified. The script says Transylvania is a planet, okay, dumb an idea as it is, it seems they were adapting it to the Space Age. It was supposed to be a planet inhabited only by vampires. They live on human blood, they need it to survive, but why is an ancestor of Captain Van Helsing blamed for the demise of an entire planet? It seems that, given time, you would just use up your resources and die off. ""Nosferatu"" had the victims die off from blood loss, and the only people who lived, were the ones only partially drained of blood. The Black Plague was to blame. Rats played a role in it, because when Orlock arrived in Bremen in the 1922 story (and the novel as well), a rat-infested ship was his transportation. Flea bites spread the illness. Turning this into an entire planet in deep space just doesn't work; it's almost like ""let's make a vampire story for a Star Trek convention!"" And adding a Hip-Hop element doesn't work either. Coolio, here, is everything that perpetuates the black racist stereotype. A black guy with funny hair, who acts like a total goof, stoned on weed all the time, talking dirty and lusting after the blonde, white woman, really doesn't help the cause of people say ""...we're not all like this."" But, people are afraid to criticize something like this, in our age of Political Correctness. They're not like that, we all know this, but if you were a script writer, and white racist at that, and wanted to insult the black culture, how would you do it? You would write a script like ""Dracula 3000."" Shame on you people.

There is some funny dialogue here, and a good point comes up in the story. In the year 3000, the characters have no idea what a crucifix is; God, Jesus, et cetera, are unheard of. And if the ACLU and similar organizations continue to sue everyone except the Muslims, this will be a reality. Because eventually, EVERY faith-based belief system will be thrown by the wayside. The people here naively call a crucifix a ""plus sign."" Of course, the cross, when you read everything into it, is supposed to mean so much more than just a design to thwart this presence. The scripture calls the Father and Son ""The Light."" This is why sunlight is such a weapon. There are a lot of Christian connotations in the original story. Impaling with wood? That was what Jesus' cross was; wood. The blood, especially in the Old Testament, was what held the life itself. Old Testament law forbade ingesting blood, period. So, using earthbound methods from yesteryear, in space, in the year 3000, is anachronistic.

There's no way the film makers were trying to take themselves seriously here. To aim the ship for a binary star system, to get a double-dose of sunlight to guarantee the death of any and all on-board vampires, and have one of the sexually frustrated crewmen have a quickie with a fembot, just before impact and the ship's destruction, killing all on board, seems to say to the audience, ""Hey, we're just kidding here!"" If this joke was intended, I got it, and this is what earned this movie a second star from me. Otherwise, it just seemed like a worthless,  dumbed-down Sci-Fi adventure story, with a supernatural element thrown in for good measure.

In Dracula 3000, the vampire clan highjacks a freight ship headed back to Earth in the year 3000. At the beginning, this story, although not terribly original, sounded interesting enough to watch.  So I watched it.

Director Darrell Roodt is able to tap some real star power for this low budget thriller including Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers); Coolio (Batman & Robin); Erika Eleniak-Goglia (Tales of the Crypt: Bordello of Blood); tough guy Tommy Lister Jr., (The Fifth Element); Udo Kier (Blade); Grant Swanby; Alexandra Kamp-Groeneveld and Langley Kirkwood.

The one person who looks painfully out of place is Langley Kirkwood. I have nothing against Kirkwood.  But when Kirkwood's character appears in the film for the first time, the film looses any credibility as an heir to the Dracula legacy. He is simply not believable as the vampire overlord from the planet Transylvania. He'd be better cast as Napoleon Dynamite.

The story of space voyagers finding an abandoned ship in deep space is nothing new. The crew decides a salvage mission is in order, which again is predictable. Coolio proceeds to steal the show as a disrespectful, drug-addicted crewmember searching the salvaged ship for swag. He accidentally wakes the vampire overlord who had been sleeping on the ship.  After becoming the vampire's first victim, Collio's character is transformed into a fearsome (and sometimes hilarious) vampire. Sadly his character's life is brief.

Other opportunities to bring the plot to life are completely ignored, such as the revelation that Van Dien's character is a descendant of famed vampire killer Van Helsing. I immediately expected some hard core vampire killing action.  Instead, Van Dien is killed off. Then the plot slowly limps to an anticlimactic end.

The only other highlight is sexy Erika Eleniak-Goglia. She plays a tough second-in-command of the ship and looks good in tight, black leather. She becomes more interesting when she reveals that she is a cyborg. Not just a cyborg, but a pleasure-bot! Guess what happens next? That's right, she dies. Like I said, there are a lot of missed opportunities to make this a better movie.

The script is poorly written and there are very few action scenes (other then various crew members running up and down the endless corridors of the abandoned ship, if you can call that action). Since Roodt is both writer and director, I place the blame squarely upon him. The basic storyline was interesting and these actors have talent, but the script gave the characters no depth.

Because this movie lacks entertaining dialogue and a clever plot, it's a disappointment. True vampire aficionados may want to check it out anyway just to see Coolio's attention-grabbing performance. However, casual fans of vampire and horror flicks should probably pass on it.",1128470400,15,2898,5.116525423728813
2168622,2,B000654YIS,"In cinematic terms the best way to explain ""Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness"" is that it cross breeds Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" and Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" In other words, a thousand years after ""Dracula 2000,"" a film that has absolutely nothing to do with this piece of dreck, a deep space salvage vessel comes across an abandoned freighter, the ""Demeter,"" from the Carpathian system. Now, if you actually read Stoker's novel instead of the Cliff Notes or screening Bela Lugosi's film for Universal, then you might recognize the ""Demeter"" is the name of the ship that brought Dracula to England in the novel and the Carpahtian mountains are where the Count made his home. You will also recognize the names of some of the characters from the novel: the captain of the ship is Abraham Van Helsing (Casper Van Dien), and then there Mina Murry (Alexandra Kemp) and Arthur ""The Professor"" Holmwood (Grant Swanby). But the rest of the charcters have names like Aurora Ash (Erika Eleniak), 187 (Coolio), and Humvee (Tom ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.). In the in-between category you have Udo Kier, who ran around as Count Dracula in ""Andy Warhol's Dracula"" way back when, appears on tape as Captain Varna of the doomed ""Demeter.""

Now, I have enjoyed most of the ""Elsewhere"" stories that DC comics has released over the years in which they take familiar stories such as the origins of Superman or Batman and set them in a different time and place (e.g., Superman in King Arthur's court or Batman in Victorian England). So I would have nothing against the idea of retelling Stoker's ""Dracula"" as a futuristic spade story. But that is not what director Darrell Roodt (""Cry the Beloved Country"") and his co-writer Ivan Milborrow have come up with here. If you watched this film with the sound off and knew one of the characters was Abraham Van Helsing you would think it was the guy in the wheelchair and not the handsome captain. Halfway through the film it becomes clear they are just using the names without any thought of referencing them to the original characters and suddenly I am thinking the inspiration here is not even to rip off the classic ""Alien"" but rather ""Jason X"" (and not just because that is the second half of the double-feature tonight on the Sci Fi Channel) That is because the plot here is that Dracula wakes up and starts killing crew members who turn into vampires so they can start killing crew members. He comes from a planet of vampires and wants to get to Earth because apparently he has killed everybody on his own planet of Transylvania in the Carpathian system (not to be confused with the galaxy of Transsexual for all of you ""Rocky Horror"" fans).

And you know what the worst part is? No, it is not that the film has a Playboy Playmate (Miss July 1989) running around dressed from start to finish (although she does offer to let someone check every inch of her body for bite marks). It is that Dracula, who runs around under the name Orlock in what I take to be a reference to the attempts to circumvent the Stoker family's rights to the novel rather than the German expressionist classic ""Nosferatu,"" is played by Langley Kirkwood, who looks like he is a refuge from a defunct boy band. Now I am thinking they are trying to rip off Anne Rice here as well and that this 2004 film is not even bad enough to make fun of. By now you are aware that the references to all of these other films is not to establish the relative position of ""Dracula 3000"" to the rest of the cinematic galaxy, but because every one of those films, including ""Jason X,"" is worth watching-going backwards at high speed-than this one.

I should also mention that when we get to the last act of the film there suddenly IS a connection between this Abraham Van Helsing and the one in Stoker's novel. Not only is this too little too late, it actually makes the plot more stupid than before, which was pretty bad. But since I reserve one-star ratings for snuff films, I have to admit that ""Dracula 3000"" does not sink down to that level and, no, I will not entertain arguments that would be a quantifiable improvement over this one that makes ""Billy the Kid Meets Dracula"" look pretty good all of the sudden.  Then again, you will like the ending (you will just wish they had done it a lot sooner).  Final Note: The tagline for this film is: ""In space, the sun never rises."" But by the same token does that not mean it never sets either?",1126915200,2,4417,4.579013906447535
2168623,1,B000654YIS,"While the premise behind this really clunky howler is intriguing (a planet of vampires in the Carpathian Galaxy and a hero named Van Helsing in the year 3000), DRACULA 3000 is so poorly acted, written and directed, it doesn't even satisfy the truly addicted vampire addict.  Casper van Dien and Erika Eleniak, both attractive actors, have never been accused of having any acting talent, and they stay true to form in this one as well.  Rapper Coolio and the ubiquitous Tiny Lister fare only a little better because their characters are meant to provide comic relief in an otherwise horrific story.  The special effects are lame and the storyline so full of miscues and holes it's a wonder the actors could even find any motivation.  Moviemakers continue to milk the Dracula legend even after almost 70 years, but films like this one only serve to make us go back to the days of Hammer and Christopher Lee to get true vampiric thrills.",1125360000,2,934,4.746913580246914

Among other atrocities committed to film include blatant gender and racial stereotypes. African Americans in this movie are either muscle bound labor or drug crazy idiots. Women are either scared princesses or hookers.

The special effects are just as poor as the rest of the film. The exteriors of the ship look like an extra credit project for an art student and the vampire `make up' is nothing more than Goth shop stick-on fangs and red contacts.

Acting is terrible and fake. I am a Dracula fan and looked forward to watching this movie but I really MUCH expected more out of this sequel. The Dracula actor doesn't enter his MASTER role.

The plot is (...), (dracula comes from a planet of vampires and he's stuck on a spaceship?, and no I'm not making this up) The movie actually spends some time ripping off other movies, which is always fun. (look for quotes from alien, star wars, star trek and others) It also takes names and places from the original bram stoker book and shoves them hap-hazardly into the movie.  There are a variety of B and C stars that make up this mess, such as Coolio, Erika Eleniak (...) and Tom Lister (Tiny) better known for his role as Zeus in the WWF movie or the president in ""5th element"" or as Deebo in ""Friday"".  The actual ""dracula"" in this movie is a complete sissy and totally un-scary, so if you are looking for a good crappy horror movie, don't watch this.  If you love to MST3K (laugh at/goof on) movies this is perfect.  The last 5 minutes of this movie are hilarious and the last 30 seconds is oscar worthy, if the oscars actually had a category for ""most unintentionally funny and stupid ending to a movie"".  I'm disappointed the Erika E. didn't run around half-(...)for the movie, after all she got pointlessly (...)in ""under siege"" with steven seagal, why not do it here?

It started with what could have been a fun premise. Retelling Bram Stoker's Dracula story in the future. There's a salvage crew that's sent out to investigate a cargo ship that's lost in space called the Demeter. Fans of the original novel will unwittingly assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of Dracula set in the future... unfortunately, short of sharing character names, this one takes the lowbrow route and goes into the B-movie galaxy twenty minutes later when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he's the best actor in the movie, and that's not saying much.

Casper Van Dien should be peddling his wares on daytime television. Erika Eleniak should have quit after she left Baywatch and poor Udo Kier is having trouble reading from the cue cards. The guy who plays Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella was in the 1970's version. If you can manage to sit through the whole movie, you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable.

First off... it had some venues it could have explored with more detail and depth... for instance, the crippled brainiac... as a vampire would have provided a nice twist to a movie that had none to offer. Dracula, a horrible character in this story, only has a couple of brief moments when he even interacts with characters and when he gets a serious injury he runs away screaming like a girl. The real Dracula would have been fierce and deadly and little things like loosing his arm would be causualties of the hunt. And Coolio... over acting and camping it up was in the wrong movie. He would have been better suited for a Blade film but his role was wasted in this mess of low budget and paper thin plotlines.
