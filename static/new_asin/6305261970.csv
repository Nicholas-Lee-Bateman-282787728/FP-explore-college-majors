998152,5,6305261970,"I've watched this every year on video tape since it was broadcast in 1998, one year after Diana's death. I always watch it on August 31, the anniversary of her death.",1411257600,3,166,4.387096774193548

998154,5,6305261970,I ordered this documentary after wanting to know more about Diana's life and passions. I found this to be a very educational documentary with many excellent interviews and video footage from Diana's life. It does not cover everything that happened in her life - and had very little to say about her relationship and breakup with Prince Charles but I expect that was consciously done to keep the focus on the good work that Diana did in her short lifetime. I lent this video to my mother as well and she loved it too.,1396310400,4,516,4.5

998295,5,6305261970,"I have always been a fan of Princess Diana for a couple of reasons:  she was born the same year I was (1961) and when she became engaged to Prince Charles, WE ALL wanted the fairytale to work!  So I watched from a distance while she had both her boys, and blossomed into a beautiful and confident woman, until she was taken from us all too soon.  Those of us who were her age when she died started to question things in our own lives.  This DVD is terrific because it goes into great detail about her early life, her marriage, and what she accomplished, especially the year after her divorce.  The price is very reasonable and any Princess Di fan will thoroughly enjoy watching it!",1301961600,36,681,4.373015873015873
998296,5,6305261970,Can anything with Diana in it be anything but wonderful?  A must have for the Diana collector such as my wife.  Won me a lot of points.,1296345600,15,135,3.962962962962963
998297,4,6305261970,"Consists mostly of various friends of and people associated with Diana speaking about her and the good she did. Some of these people are rarely if ever seen in other videos, Lucia Flecha De Lima and a few charity benificiaries are examples, which is a good point. You will see Diana in some of the same footage shown in so many other videos but you won't see the unhappiness in her life, for this memorial program they left out the accusations,scandals and rumors. This program does have some divorce, Camilla & Dodi bits but not much, mostly it is a review of the happy good things in the Princess' life.",1010793600,5,605,4.509090909090909
