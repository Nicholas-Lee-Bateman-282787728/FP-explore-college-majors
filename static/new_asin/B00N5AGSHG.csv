6611646,1,B00N5AGSHG,"Frustrating movie takes place over the last two years of Errol Flynn's life, beginning with his filming of Too Much Too Soon which was apparently when he met Beverly Aadland, his fifteen year old girlfriend on a studio lot.  The Last of Robin Hood does such a poor job of establishing time that the whole film seems to take place over the course of months.  The film suggests that Errol Flynn's movie career was completely washed up by the time he made Too Much Too Soon which is not accurate--The Sun Also Rises, Too Much Too Soon and The Roots of Heaven represented a creative rebound by Flynn that did not go unnoticed around Hollywood, one that suggested strongly he would have made a healthy comeback garnering the more serious types of roles he had always craved if he hadn't died at age 50.

The Last of Robin Hood squanders a fine performance by Kevin Kline as the aging matine idle, filled with self-pity over lost youth and opportunities and reduced to seducing girls who are bit players and extras.  The most obvious problem with The Last Days of Robin Hood is that it isn't actually about Errol Flynn, who could easily be a fascinating subject for a film and instead focuses on his underage girlfriend Beverly, played with so much detachment by Dakota Fanning that the character never seems human, let alone interesting.  There's nothing about Beverly that suggests she should be taking the spotlight away from Errol Flynn or that she has an interesting story worthy of audience attention.

Dakota Fanning can't plausibly pass for fifteen but that isn't really a problem--Beverly is supposed to look older than her years and is working in Hollywood with a fake birth certificate that says she's 19.  But the fact that Fanning has no chemistry with costar Kevin Kline is a problem, as is the fact that both the actress and the character she's playing seem to have no virtues beyond youth.  Dakota Fanning's tendency towards somewhat robotic performances as a child actress might prove to be a bigger career hindrance now that she's an adult--there's simply nothing alive or authentic about her work here, just an icy detachment that renders her character hollow and dull.

To make matters worse The Last of Robin Hood is told from the perspective of Beverly's showbiz mom Florence (a barely going through the motions Susan Sarandon) who is telling her daughter's story to a book writer.  That dramatic device creates a damaging layer of detachment between film and audience--everything we're seeing already happened and is being related by a minor character who had no direct involvement in any of the important events in the film.  Sarandon's character is a peripheral one at best but The Last Of Robin Hood keeps placing her front and center thanks to the fact that she is telling the story.

Errol Flynn led a very colorful life and his story could make for an interesting film--unfortunately The Last of Robin Hood isn't Errol Flynn's story and the movie is definitely not entertaining or interesting--it's a film where Errol Flynn falls for a girl who might as well be a mannequin for all the warmth she displays and where Susan Sarandon gives a performance that never rises above the level of someone reading their lines directly from the script.  In the end Kevin Kline is the only reason to endure this dull showbiz tale that is about as juicy as a wad of year old gum found under the kitchen table.  Why would someone choose to make a movie about Errol Flynn's relationship with a fifteen year old girl so dull and tasteful?  Where's the sex?  Where's the Errol Flynn who can't control his libido's twin urges for women and drink?  Why is Beverly such a lifeless bore when she should be young and vivacious?  Why is Beverly's mother given so much screen-time?

The Last of Robin Hood is a terrible movie that never seems to figure out what it wants to be and ends up offering possibly the most pointless 91 minutes of film you will see all year.  It's a movie with no purpose or reason to exist which will be quickly forgotten by anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it.",1426550400,2,4094,4.715287517531557
6611647,1,B00N5AGSHG,I love Kevin Kline but even he could not save this movie.,1426291200,,57,3.8333333333333335
6611648,3,B00N5AGSHG,"This film, ""The Last of Robin Hood"" was co-written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland. This is the same team that gave us ""Still Alice"" with Julianne Moore as Dr. Alice Howland in an Academy Award winning portrayal. I find this biopic which shines a light on the egocentric Errol Flynn (Kevin Kline) so different but engaging. With a fully lascivious Flynn who is well played by a swanky and flamboyant Kline, the two lead actresses didn't seem to fare as well separately as Kline did for me. I was compelled to warm up to the character of Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning), but from whatever angle I tried, I just couldn't find the sympathetic character I believed she was written to be and why Flynn saw her as having such talent. He is so taken with her and being actively pursued by an enabling campaign from her mother, Florence (Susan Sarandon), of her considerable charms. In reality, she is fifteen-years-old at the time this picture is covering although she did have a fake Birth Certificate stating she was eighteen. Beverly's father, Herb (Patrick St. Esprit) cannot stand the circumstances with his daughter as they stand and is furious with his wife, Florence. She is cunning, manipulative and conniving to get her daughter in Flynn's good graces by living vicariously through her.

As much as Errol Flynn does not take ""No"" for an answer, the plain fact of Beverly being just fifteen was equally unsettling to me (although nothing new for Flynn). This is the era of the star-making, omnipresent 'Casting Couch' which went along with dinner and then a night on the town. These parts may be skipped over more to show their reciprocal relationship. Dakota Fanning is twenty to twenty-one years old now and looks her correct age while fifteen is a stretch for her look especially in the glamorous scenes of the film. A lot of the party scenes do show off some of Hollywood's glamor of the day and even intimate talks where Flynn tells Beverly that he wants to call her ""Woodsy"" being that she reminds him of a little ""Wood Nymph"". It is evident that Florence has her own agenda about her daughter being a star while Beverly is soon as fascinated with the effervescent personality of Errol Flynn and what he can offer her. But does she show the talent? The two do appear to care for each other considering their onscreen chemistry and warmth together.

With this film showing the alcohol consuming and aging big Hollywood star, I felt uneasy while seeing the once vibrant man and 'star' brought pretty low in comparison to those huge Hollywood movie days. Flynn was the dashingly handsome Hollywood box-office draw and now this appears mostly to be told from Beverly's point of view and had me feeling badly for Flynn (oddly enough though he hadn't lost his arrogance) which I didn't think was the intention the film was striving for. I had watched him first in ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" with Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland, then ""Captain Blood"" with  de Havilland again and of whom he did several paired films along with. ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" once again with her and, of course, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" also with de Havilland. He was so captivating that one could not take their eyes off of him on the big screen. These classics, along with many others, established the Hollywood icon status Errol Flynn enjoyed during the time. He had the world in his grasp, but the focus here in this film is his last days of which I hadn't a clue about.

In this movie, he has gone far from this point and I thought it was an ambitious film, but an extremely well-done portrayal by Kevin Kline. There is an anxiety-riddled friction between Beverly and mother Florence during their scenes which prove truthtelling as it builds throughout the movie from the outset. When Kline is doing a scene with either or both of the two actresses, it is worth it. In this, Kevin Kline shines as the once swashbuckling but still forcefully charming Errol Flynn. Possibly see this on a rental for Kevin Kline's performance and weigh it if you would like the movie as a whole. I did have a couple laughs with the scenes of Beverly's father's reactions and with the ego of Flynn out in full force. This certainly is different from what I was expecting and it was engaging with some genuinely warmer places. In my book it is very hard for me to think that Kevin Kline does much of anything off-kilter, here I do not think he did either. Give a view during the end credits for pictures of the two (Flynn and Kline) compared to each other. Overall, an entertaining watch for me especially concerning Kevin Kline's Errol Flynn with a few surprisingly questionable moments during his last years.",1426204800,5,4729,4.693975903614458

6611652,5,B00N5AGSHG,"This movie is a mixture of good and hard at the same time. I was thinking a lot about when I started becoming a fan of Kevin at the age of 13 when most fans are around my mom's age or older. Kevin deserves a gold medal for the best Errol Flynn. Some people (even Kevin) say that he doesn't look like Flynn. Onto a scene where Flynn got sick in Cuba and he told Beverly that he's dying, I cried really hard hoping that Kevin wouldn't perish on us (Family, Friends, fans, people who worked with him). So I said ""Please stay with us. I'm scared."" Otherwise, this movie is good. He's like the Errol Flynn of the modern times. I admired Dakota for more than a decade since Uptown Girls. Beverly is a troubled girl. Florence on the other hand is over protective. Her husband was cruel. Towards the end, I've been thinking about what my mom said to me about putting me in foster care and how I can just run away to reunite with my parents. This is a something we watch at home. I admired Susan Sarandon for more than 7 years since Enchanted. The term wannabes is not used till the 1980's. I didn't know that he character had an artificial leg till I saw this. I'm not such a big fan of drama's. There are some drama's I liked. I wanted to see this since the trailer was posted and when it was released on the big screen. Right after I saw the movie, I kept hoping that Kevin doesn't get to be in an erotic movie so I'd say: Oh please, do not be in an erotic movie. I love you and I want to see more of you. I don't want to be in love with anybody else.",1425513600,,1545,4.035830618892508

6611654,1,B00N5AGSHG,"For 20 years Errol Flynn was one of the most popular actors in the world - Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), Robin Hood (1938), Dawn Patrol(1938), Sea Hawk (1940), They Died with their Boots On (1941), Roots of Heaven (1958). But this film is a poor tribute to his final years.

Despite a strong performance by Kevin Kline who also manages to look like Flynn, the rest of the film is more like a docudrama than a film. It fails to capture the 50s spirit and the references to Hollywood insiders like Melvin Belli will be lost on almost everyone.

Dakota Fanning plays the young girl with whom Flynn spent his final years, but theres almost nothing in Fannings performance that seems attractive. Yes, shes pretty, but Flynn could have many pretty girls, so there is little transmitted as to why he chose her. Fanning at 19 looks far too old to be the 15 year old Aadland. I thought she did a much better job in Man on Fire (2004) than she does here.

Susan Sarandon plays Aadlands  mother and while I am a big fan of her in general, this was not one of her best performances. She seemed to be acting the part rather than being the part, something that can rarely be said for this Oscar winning actress from such films as Thelma and Louise, Atlantic City, and Dead Man Walking

I knew I was in trouble when the credits rolled and I saw a long long list of producers. Thats rarely a good sign. And a film with 2 directors is also a red flag.

If you're a big Errol Flynn fan you want to give this one a miss.",1410566400,8,1507,4.251748251748252
6611655,2,B00N5AGSHG,"There was a time when Errol Flynn had the world at his fingertips. The Hollywood legend lived a flamboyant life full of privilege, and he wasn't afraid to wave that privilege around in others' faces. Most of all this extended to his love of women, and the famous lothario used his star power and soothing charms to woo the knickers off his share of ladies. But while he once had everything it did not extend to the final years of his life chronicled in the shoddy, lukewarm biopic The Last of Robin Hood.

The Last of Robin Hood is as questionable as Flynn's personal and professional judgment during his final years when he was a barely functioning alcoholic. But he still had that big Hollywood swagger even if Hollywood only looked at him as an object of pity. Taken literally, the film is about 15-year-old Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning), the last of the Robin Hood star's scandalous relationships. The decision to focus on Aadland, a figure few remember for pretty good reason, is just one of numerous mistakes by writing/directing duo Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, whose production looks barely above that of novice filmmakers. Flynn, who lived an infinitely interesting life beyond his nailing an underaged groupie, is relegated to little more than a pathetic sad sack, selling short a game performance by Kline.

Beverly proves to be the character least worth our time and the one we spend the most with. The end of the story serves as our intro, as Beverly's celebrity-obsessed mother Florence (Susan Sarandon) is caught in a sea of reporters as they wait for her daughter's plane to arrive. Flo is eating up the limelight, something she's quietly always sought and used her daughter to get. Years earlier, Beverly was a nobody on the chorus line of a Gene Kelly production, until she happened to catch Flynn's prowling eye. He approached her, took her out for an evening of dinner, drinks, and the ol' casting couch. They began seeing one another, and not even learning she was still a high school student could dissuade the horny (and desperate) Flynn. Flo pretends to be clueless while giving her quiet consent, but her husband, who calls Flynn ""a walking penis"" in the movie's funniest moment, is disgusted and files for divorce.

It's a story demanding to be told with a sensationalistic flair but Westmoreland and Glatzer opt for respectful and reserved. They spend the entire film trying to explain away the actions of three totally unlikable people. So we get Flynn, who always seems like the pitiful old guy at the club, flying Beverly from one high-profile gig after another with her always coming up short. She's talentless, beautiful and icy, but utterly without a shred of potential. It's all because of her mom, who we learn had superstar aspirations of her own once, that has pushed her into the public eye and thus public humiliation. Trying to gain our sympathy was the wrong approach to take, and some of the most awful details were left out or deliberately glossed over (Flynn was charged with statutory rape before) for fear of making things too complex. Why not put everything out there and let the audience decide?

In a poor attempt to capture the Technicolor look of the era, the whole thing comes out looking extremely ugly. Drably shot and lacking momentum, it's basically one boring, cautious conversation after another. How can such a salacious story turn out so dull? Not even Kline, who at his age still has a young man's gleam and energy, can do much to save this hopeless film. He gets no help from a listless Fanning, who mistakes being flat for naivet. Sarandon does what she can with an underwritten role, almost making us forgive Flo for pimping out her daughter. But no, not quite. ""Not quite"" pretty much sums up The Last of Robin Hood. It's almost a meaningful look at the downfall of a true Hollywood legend, and maybe under better directors and smarter casting it might have been.",1409616000,19,3941,4.799705449189985

6611662,4,B00N5AGSHG,Kline and Sarandon drive the story very satisfyingly. Fanning's performance is somewhat apathetic but enough to convince the viewer that she is sincerely attached to the main character. This is not a story where the old guy is a monster that exploits the innocent young girl: this movie does not give a moral judgement and that is why it is an enjoyable film.,1464739200,,359,4.714285714285714

6611664,2,B00N5AGSHG,"When the subject is someone as out-sized as Errol Flynn -- a certain amount of theatricality is called for, but in this film denied. Even though Robin Hood, Captain Blood, and The Sea Hawk were heroes of mine, and Flynn himself had certain undeniable qualities (humor, charisma, good looks, intelligence, and a certain machismo), in the end Flynn was as corrupt and morally bankrupt as Dorian Gray. With the exception of Sarandon, the actors play their parts with all the intensity of a reality TV show cast -- Fanning is as bland and uninteresting as one might expect a 16 year old to be in the company of more sophisticated adults, Kline portrays Flynn as old and as tired as any ordinary, aging, shop-worn country club Lothario. The problem is Kline and Dakota are too real, too ordinary, too under-sized to be of much interest. Kline's Flynn is neither appallingly grotesque nor charismatic, while Dakota's Beverly Aadland is anybody's willful teen-age daughter. The problem is not with the actors but with the uninspired script, and workmanlike direction. There is conversation, but no dialogue; storms but no lightning. Sarandon alone rises a bit above this and succeeds in giving us a lively character, interesting in her own right despite the material she has to work with. All in all, a talented cast wasted in a plausible but uninspired effort.",1461801600,,1354,4.942982456140351
6611665,4,B00N5AGSHG,"As someone who is a movie buff, I enjoyed this flick. I thought Kevin Klein who bears a close resemblance to Flynn at the latter part of his life gave a convincing performance. Dakota Fanning certainly reminds me of Beverly Aadland.",1458259200,,232,4.682926829268292

6611667,4,B00N5AGSHG,"I am a big fan of the Golden age of Hollywood and Errol Flynn will always hold a soft spot in my heart. This tells the story of how the aging and ill Flynn met his last wife. She was a mere 15 years old  one Beverley Aadland (Dakota Fanning). This was a spirited girl who was being driven to be an actress by her alcoholic mothers own ambitions. This is Florence Aadland played brilliantly by Susan Sarandon.

From what I know of this part of Flynns life the film is fairly faithful to the facts. Kevin Kline as the ageing Lothario is actually excellent  he plays the part with enough of the rogue to be believable but with the right level of empathy to make the man live.  They also recreate some of the last filmatic roles and that part of the film is very enjoyable.

The problem is it does not go anywhere too exciting in the 94 minute run time and so has been criticised for that. That said I really enjoyed it.

6611687,5,B00N5AGSHG,"This film makes no pretension of being a block-buster. This movie however speaks volumes.
The story expertly weaves four individual stories about three desperate people:

In the first, Dakota Fanning plays the impetuous if somewhat naive Beverly Aadland, chorus line performer and aspiring actress, Errol Flynns last serious love interest.

In the second story, Susan Sarandon plays her mother, Florence Aadland, the mother, who grooms her daughter to live out the dreams of her own derailed acting career.

Last, but not least, there is Kevin Kline, who plays a very world-weary, once great but now-a has-been Hollywood actor, Errol Flynn.

The fourth story is the heart of this movie. In this story, each of these persons use the other to meet their respective needs and get what they want.

Rather than present these stories in separate vignettes, the story unfolds as a series of flashbacks, one intertwined with the other, as told by the mother to her ghost writer writing a book her daughter does not want told.  The result is a very satisfying movie.

The performances are fantastic!

If Dakota Fannings performance is lackluster, it is for a reason. In life, Beverly Aadland was a mediocre, at best, performer, with average skills.  Dakota Fanning very convincingly displays that mediocrity.

Susan Sarandon is great as a boozy, doting, mother out to make her daughter the success in Hollywood she never was.

Kevin Kline? What can you say about his performance  he is spot on as Errol Flynn. He looks like Errol Flynn, he acts and speaks like Errol Flynn. His demeanor reeks of the burned out actor, someone who squandered what little real talent he possessed on alcohol, women, drugs, escapades, and anything else that crossed his path.  It is a five-star performance.

This is ultimately a very sad movie for all these reasons, but one which should not be missed.",1433376000,5,1874,4.983922829581994

6611698,3,B00N5AGSHG,"The film is based on a true story about the romance of the famous Errol Flynn (Kevin Kline) and an obscure ""actress"" Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning). The film starts after his death so it can utilize narration of the mother Florence Aadland (Susan Sarandon). The flashbacks start when Flynn sees her as a background dance for Gene Kelly' ""Marjorie Morningstar"" released in 1958. Flynn was apparently unaware or didn't care that she was a minor at the onset. Mom, a former dancer, eventually encourages the relationship.

This was a major tabloid event. Monica Lewinsky was not the first young woman to be ""misunderstood"" and have her name dragged in the mud. Beverly Aadland is seen as being less talented than Kristen Stewart, if possible. I thought the female acting was good. Kline as Flynn was boring. I was excited as I love films of the era, ""My Week with Marilyn"" or 'Hitchcock"" just to name two. This one didn't seem to measure up. Where was the climax scene? There were no great scenes and there were slow scenes. 3 Stars.

Guide: Brief sex scene. Kline nearly naked except for a hat. IMDB claims 2 F-bombs that I missed although I caught the ""C"" word and an SOB.",1426982400,,1173,4.661835748792271
6611699,3,B00N5AGSHG,"This lethargic account of the affair between Hollywood swashbuckling leading man Errol Flynn (Kevin Kline) and underage chorus girl Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning) never gains traction.  The culprits would be lackluster script and direction and a woefully miscast Fanning who never develops chemistry with Kline.  Kline and Susan Sarandon as Aadland's enabling stage mother are quite good but can't compensate for the film's shortcomings. A lot of reviewers take issue with Fanning being too old for the part but both Kline and Sarandon are close to seventy.  Last year Sarandon played Melissa McCarthy's grandmother in ""Tammy"".  It's like an episode of ""E! Hollywood True Story"" without the panache.  Universal partnered with the Lifetime Network for this flick and it shows. Not a bad film but glaringly bland and mediocre.  Made me long for ""My Favorite Year"", a 1982 film where Peter O'Toole played an Errol Flynn type actor trying to make a comeback by appearing on a TV variety show.",1426982400,,990,5.15625
6611700,3,B00N5AGSHG,"Kevin Kline, although at least 15 years older than the character, physically resembles Errol Flynn.  Susan Sarandon throws herself into the role of Florence Aadland, the pushy stage-mother who both manically promotes the March-December relationship between her 15 year-old daughter and the 49 year-old movie star, while righteously defending herself from charges of basically pimping out her own child.  Yet, despite the best efforts of these two fine actors, they cannot overcome a weak script that neither panders to the prurient, nor offers any thoughtful insight.  The dialog is flat and the situations are cliched.

Dakota Fanning is so bland, washed-out and UN-animated as Beverly Aadland you have to wonder what Flynn sees in her.  He had been down this path before and, following a scandalous 1941 court case involving two teen-aged girls, he certainly knew what was at stake.  (Though in fairness to Flynn, the Aadlands lied about Beverly's age to the studio, and had faked documents indicating she was 18 in order to work in Las Vegas.)

Seventy-five years ago Errol Flynn was a legendary movie star adored by millions of men and women. He was unequivocally handsome, well-spoken, athletic, graceful, charming, possessed of a wicked sense of humor, and ridiculously wealthy. It's too bad he didn't share Dorian Gray's portraitist, because in fewer than 20 years Flynn would go from the epitome of masculine beauty to become a bloated, dissipated wreck.  Apparently he never encountered a vice he didn't like to excess. Despite his all his problems, Flynn still had a reputation, Hollywood connections and access to movie studies.  Against this backdrop, the aging actor enlisted well-known costume designer Orry-Kelly to cross the studio lot and invite the 15 year-old Beverly Aaadland to meet the legend.  The rest is, as they say, history.

Except, as presented in ""The Last of Robin Hood"" the history is fairly boring.",1426723200,,1931,5.196774193548387

But this movie was a total waste of time and talent, and a grave disservice to Mr. Flynn's memory.  This movie is not Errol Flynn's legacy or how he should be remembered.  This production profits from and panders to the lowest form of people's morbid curiosity.  And trying to drag Errol's heroic character of Robin Hood down into the grave along with his corpse was an inexcusable act of greed, stupidity and ignorance. Viva Flynn!!!  Viva Robin Hood!!!
