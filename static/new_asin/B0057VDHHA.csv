8533568,1,B0057VDHHA,"Horrible sound, horrible visuals, horrible band/song selection. I remember this line-up being amazing, yet this dvd cuts away so many of the bands people were there to see. I cannot express enough how bad the sound and visual quality is. Plus, no special features besides full sets by bands no one likes. Don't waste your money.",1331164800,5,328,4.875
