8619931,1,B00G0OMAT4,Very disappointed. It was just a selections of so called true stories.,1519171200,,70,4.916666666666667
8619932,2,B00G0OMAT4,"This is a 75 minute DVD that includes 7 episodes (you do the math) of various encounters with creatures in the frightful nation of Canada. Most of the creatures are some sort of animal. The episodes are done documentary style which include eye witness interviews, interviews with historians, some low budget re-enactments, and of course actual grainy film footage.

The films start out as watchable and then digress. If you like the Bigfoot/Nessie type stuff, this film and Canada may be for you. Personally I wasn't overly entertained or educated.",1448582400,,548,5.088888888888889
