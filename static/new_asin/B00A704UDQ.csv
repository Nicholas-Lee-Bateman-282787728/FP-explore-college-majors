5391191,5,B00A704UDQ,I watched this film twice because my heart was moved by the cruelty that was imposed upon the lives of innocent people. I hope that their legacies and memories will never be forgotten. There still is hope when we turn to prayer and trust God to avenge those who harm others.,1364515200,3,274,4.392156862745098
5391192,4,B00A704UDQ,"A Little Pond tells of the scarcely mentioned U.S. massacre of innocent South Korean refugees during the Korean War. A Little Pond is a compelling and powerful drama.

The story in A Little Pond is interesting. It's a story that I've never seen on film, and a story that I've never heard in detail. The first half of the film, or so, takes the time to introduce some characters and the setting, while hauntingly setting up the inevitable. What I mean is: the villagers constantly praise the U.S. army and feel safe, all while the audience helplessly waits for the atrocities we know will eventually happen. The second half of the film shows the horrendous massacre and briefly explains why it happened. The acting was amazing in this film, and South Korean film fans will see many familiar faces. I also enjoyed the music in this film, which complimented the setting and storyline. My complaint lies in the very short runtime; this film introduces many characters, and this group of refugees only continues to grow throughout the film, which leaves very little time to really connect. And, although I mentioned you'd see many familiar faces, their screen time is extremely limited. The special effects ranged from good to bad, as well, although it's not heavily reliant on them.

Overall, A Little Pond tells a powerful, barely-told story, with great acting and a fast pace. As of 1/2/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also recommended.

A Little Pond has strong blood and violence, and some nudity",1357171200,9,1531,4.85823754789272
5391204,5,B00A704UDQ,Horrible story if it is all true and it probably was true.  But worth watching for any age American.,1436832000,,100,4.2631578947368425
5391205,1,B00A704UDQ,Started off good but how overly gun crazy were the directors ? The storyline was....well missing,1436745600,,96,5.0625

5391207,4,B00A704UDQ,"Thank you Mr. Lee !!
  Thank you for bringing the heart breaking truth out of the shadows into a colorful movie we can all relate to. I'm giving your movie four stars because of the importance of bringing something like this to the public eye.  Your film ,quite frankly, humbled me and when I feel down or over worked I remember ""a little pond""  then realize how fortunate and spoiled rotten I really am.",1434499200,,404,4.418918918918919
5391208,5,B00A704UDQ,"Excellent moving depicting the reality of war and how innocent lives are taken.  Our history of war isn't always civil.  Watch to see another reality that is atrocious, but true.  My heart goes out to those innocent Korean people who lost their lives and loved ones.",1431648000,,266,4.739130434782608

5391213,4,B00A704UDQ,"July 26 - 29 1950, an undetermined number of South Korean villagers were killed by the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, as well as an air attack at a railroad bridge near the village of No Gun Ri, where the reports, as of 2005, listed an estimated 163 dead or missing and 55 wounded (mostly women and children)- U.S. Army reports casualties as ""unknown""... Both the South Korean Govt., and the U.S. Army covered up the event, and denied it happened until 1999...

""A Little Pond"" is that event... and it is not for the faint of heart... This is truly a heartbreaking film with good performances... The film is rather short, for the subject at hand... it does not go into a lot of character development, nor does it deal with the cover-up and the eventual realization that this event even took place... This film gets right to the point, and builds up to the tragic event...It is slightly bloody, but not excessive... may be a little slow paced for some viewers, but a worthy and memorable viewing...",1373500800,3,994,4.584269662921348
8547351,1,B00A704UDQ,"Terrible quality: blurry picture with artifacts, unreadable text. Who butchered this movie so badly? It's from 2005, so the technology to produce it in good quality was there already! As to the movie contents, there was no little pond anywhere, so why this title? Made no sense at all. For this storyline the movie was simply too long, hence BORING. The producer obviously wanted to emphasize/dramatize the sufferings, but he did so by dragging everything out: endless shootings, when we already got the point and it doesn't take more, than 5 minutes to massacre a handful of people, so why did we have to watch shootings for half an hour? I only bought it, because it's a historically significant event, for which the Americans haven't apologized to this very day and because this seemed to be the only place to get it. But the quality is that of a pirated copy and the contents is that of a beginning producer, who doesn't know much about filming yet.",1521936000,,953,4.712574850299402

8547356,4,B00A704UDQ,"This is remarkably real.  When I recently lived and taught South of Busan in Sacheon, South Korea, the villages and farmlands were right on the other side of the river. I took long walks regularly through the fields, ancient villages and up into the mountains because I loved it and the way the people are portrayed in this reminds me so very much of those I knew, however slightly, while I was there.",1450051200,,401,4.493150684931507
8547357,1,B00A704UDQ,bad movie and ugly shooting the movie. completely no impression.,1445558400,,64,5.5
8547358,4,B00A704UDQ,"Unimaginable but a story that needed to be told.  My heart was torn to pieces watching American soldiers shooting at will with no conscience of who were in South Korea to protect (the civilians).  I wish more people view this movie.  War is hell and atrocities of war should always be exposed so leadership develops a ""pause"" factor when it comes to taking the lives of innocent people.  But for American soldiers the South Koreans would have suffered more extreme consequences in defeat so condemnation is not appropriate -- just reflection and accountability.",1444089600,,561,5.0
8547359,4,B00A704UDQ,"This movie was good in a bad way.  It takes a peek into what really happened in the Korean war.  Left me mad at the US, ... with a tad more understanding of just how ugly war is.  Will tug at your heart.",1439078400,,203,3.6744186046511627
