535366,5,6303039294,"This is Lena Horne's first movie. In it she plays a singer, the Bronze Nightengale or Bronze Venus, who partners with the good-hearted Duke of the  title. This is not Duke Ellington; the role is played by Ralph Cooper. It  is fascinating to compare Lena's somewhat tentative performance in this  movie to her confident and dynamic appearances in later movies such as  Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. This movie is characterized by a good,  sound plot in which Duke and Lena are forced to split up for business  reasons. I expected it to be one of those typical plots where the woman  learns to know her place, and realizes that she shouldn't put her career  ahead of her love-life. I was pleasantly surprised.  Ralph Cooper does a  fine job playing Duke, and we also get to see him at work as a band leader.  There are several other thoroughly enjoyable characters as well, such as  Duke's humorous con-man buddy who becomes Duke's partner after he splits  with Lena. The scenes where Duke and the con-man sell patent medicine in  small southern towns are really funny. We also get to see some fine musical  performances not only by Lena Horne and Ralph Cooper, but also by an  obscure but wonderful group called The Cats and the Fiddle, who resemble  the Mills Brothers.  This is a movie that I enjoy watching again and  again. The sound isn't too great in the beginning (maybe that's just my  copy), but then it improves after the first few scenes. I highly recommend  this movie, especially if you are, as I am, a fan of early jazz and  African-American cinema.",967680000,15,1569,4.608695652173913

Lena Horn is stunning and cool as usual in, ""The Duke is Tops"" (singing several songs beautifully) and Freddie Washington was beyond talented and beautiful in ""Black and Tan."" It is painful that because of her very light (stunning) looks, she could not be used in many films of the era...(Too light for most AA films and her 1 drop of AA blood made it illegal for her to be romantic with a Caucasian male on film) at least we can see a taste of her beauty and true talent in Black and Tan!  For MUCH more of Freddie Washington, see the great movie, ""Imitation of Life""  -- the first version with Claudette Colbert.",1419984000,,763,4.366197183098592

In 2006, Westlake's new owners changed their catalog from public domain material to first run features. This title predates the transition.

THE DUKE IS TOPS, an 80-minute movie shot in just ten days, was also twenty-one-year-old Lena Horne's inauspicious screen debut. As Ethel, the so-called Bronze Venus, she's unrecognizably fat, has pencil line brows, plus a bad hairstyle and make-up. That classic voice hasn't emerged yet and wouldn't until her 1947 marriage to Lennie Hayton. His invaluable support and encouragement helped make Lena a star.

SYNOPSIS
The ""Duke"" is a show promoter who falls on hard times when he makes sure that his star performer, Ethel has a shot at the Big Time. Now impoverished, Duke is reduced to working in an itinerant medicine show. This unlikely format eventually leads to renewed success for him. Some especially good musical sequences include talented tapping by Willie Covan, also the Basin Street Boys, a quartet with guitar that sound like the early Mills Bros. A film worth seeing.
