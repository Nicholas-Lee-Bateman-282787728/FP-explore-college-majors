8154944,4,B000K7VL4W,"Really like all of the short stories clips, each so unique and really good. I would watch it again.",1469232000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8154945,4,B000K7VL4W,This is the Japanese equivalent of the Outer Limits. This is a short series but you need to watch it over and over again. Every time you watch this you will notice something more. The first time you watch the stories do not seem related but as you watch you will see more and more how they are. Every time I watch these great episodes I find another little Easter egg. Any fan of Japanese horror won't be disappointed in this series.,1413763200,,433,4.2926829268292686
8154946,4,B000K7VL4W,"To begin, I would like to say that this collection is a must have for any fan of Japanese horror given the amount of content for the listed price.  It's just too much of a bargain to pass up.

As for the series itself, there are some really great episodes, a few that are so-so, and a few more which sort of leave you frowning as you turn off the DVD player.  The production value is generally not very high, so the best episodes are those which are heavy on story and a little lighter on special effects.  That said, there are a couple of tales which try to be a little deeper and more philosophical than they ultimately wind up being.

Which stories you enjoy the most is mostly a matter of taste and whether or not you favor a satisfying shudder of revulsion or a series of laughs at campy SFX and bizarre plot twists.  Either way, you likely find a little of both in Prayer Beads.",1372550400,,884,4.201183431952662
8154947,4,B000K7VL4W,I own it. It was pretty good. With some Asian horror movies the plots are hard to follow. But this was a series of short scary stories so I enjoyed them. Some stories were weird but others were very good. I was pleasantly surprised.,1218931200,2,232,4.295454545454546
8154948,3,B000K7VL4W,"Prayer Beads is one of the better Japanese horror anthology tv series to come out in a while.  Though it starts off slow and has many episodes not worth watching, there are some truly scary and original tales here.  Definitely worth a look from the J-Horror fan.",1183766400,5,262,4.553191489361702
8154949,5,B000K7VL4W,"Prayer Beads is 9 tales of the dark and creepy, srrt of a ""Tales from the Darkside"" look and feel but more a ""Masters Of Horror"" mentality.  Some of the tales seem overly ambitious, as in, there's almost too much crammed into a 30 minute segment and focus is lost, but that's a minor complaint.  There's a couple that discover a vending machine in the middle of nowhere that dispenses questionable beverages, there's cute little seals that draw big crowds to a river and turn out to be nowhere near as cute as originally thought, and there's even a creepy ""Hello Kitty"" knock-off cartoon that appears on a young boy's computer and makes his wishes come true.  All of these tales come off pretty well considering their origin, which is apparently Japanese TV (cable, I'd say, the language isn't always PC and the gore flies at times).  A worthwhile anthology to fans of Japanese horror.  5 out of 5 stars.",1174608000,11,904,4.625
