8394799,5,B003DK3WM2,"As long as newspapers do not lie out of malice, they are not held responsible when they malign private citizens, even though the news is fake news. Sally Field plays an ambitious reporter who accepts what a prosecutor states that the government is looking into the life of Paul Newman who it suspects committed a crime. She prints it, even though it maligns Newman and results in hurting his business, lose friends, and a close friend dies. Newman decides to get revenge and does so very effectively. The plot and acting are very good. While one may want to draw a parallel between this situation and the attacks against President Trump, the rules are different for political figures.",1521504000,,684,4.805084745762712
8394800,5,B003DK3WM2,"Elliott Rosen is an obsessive prosecutor who is desperate to get some inside info on the ""mob."" He steps in to a moral grey area in his pursuit. Knowing that Michael Colin Gallagher (Paul Newman) is innocent of any crime he plans to push him into finding out who did it. The plan is simple he will leak the false fact out, through reporter Megan Carter (Sally Field), that Gallagher is being investigated. This information has a negative impact on Gallagher's business. Further pursuit leads to a death of the innocent. Naturally the paper that prints this has no intention of retracting. Gallagher finds a unique solution. See if you can spot it.

This movie does not make an immediate impact on you with the exception of Brimley's final confrontation speech. However repeated viewing brings out the subtleties that will make this one of your favorite movies for years to come.",1503446400,,878,4.814569536423841

It begins with movies of a meeting of men for a funeral. They are the targets of an investigation by Federal officials. The locale is around Miami Florida. Will a worker get in trouble for mentioning a name? Megan goes to interview a government agent. Will he plant a story on this reporter? Will she suspect something? Can this story be printed? Can they interview Michael Gallagher? He shows up to complain to the reporter. What will they print when the truth is found? The Head of the Strike Force explains his strategy: turn Gallagher into an informant. [But what if he is innocent?] Megan joins Gallagher for lunch; they converse about the media. If charged, people assume guilt. If not guilty, nobody cares. [Sad but true.] There is a conflict over labor. Later Gallagher meets Megan; they talk.

Megan's father was a banker. Gallagher's father was convicted of loan-sharking. Gallagher meets his uncle. Who is setting him up? Megan meets Theresa in public. She was with Michael at the time, but she can't go public because of her job with a school. It was a personal problem. What is relevant in this story? [Don't talk to a reporter about anything?] Theresa has an accident and died at home. [Note the mix of typewriters and video terminals.] Megan tells Michael who leaked the story. The investigation continues to target Michael, even if innocent! Can Michael investigate Rosen? Gallagher offers a deal to a Federal investigator. Then he goes to see Megan and talk. The Feds announce the end of the investigation. Rosen wants new telephone taps (w/o a warrant!). Megan writes a front-page article.

Michael gets a telephone call from a friend. [Does a handkerchief over a telephone really disguise a voice?] Gallagher meets Quinn in a parking lot. A man takes pictures. Megan is told to bail out of the friendship. Was somebody bought off? Or was that a set-up? Does a newspaper print truthful facts? ""What's wrong?"" ""Things aren't always what they seem."" ""They usually are."" A new headline asks about a Quinn-Gallagher link. How true is this news? There is a meeting before the Assistant Attorney-General Wells. Either they talk or get a subpoena before the Grand Jury. They talk about anonymous contributions. Was this a frame-up? Megan tells about reading the file. ""I can't tell you."" Jimmy is responsible. Elliot will leave Government service. Does everybody lose? What happens next?

This seems to be a message movie about the abuse of power in government and the press. How many politicians use the press? This movie tries to educate you about the manipulation in the news. Do you believe everything you read in your newspaper? Ever learn of a crime in your neighborhood? How accurate was the newspaper report (if there even was a report)? One reason to omit a crime is to prevent a copy-cat repeat. Does the Justice Dept. act like in this movie? Who watches the watchers? This movie could be faster paced. Was this story based on a true crime?",1416355200,,3011,4.829457364341085
