7538976,5,B0182YCOHM,"I have followed the poetry of Tiffany Heath for quite awhile and she is one of my favorites for her beautifully brutal and intensely riveting work. So that said,her artistic shadow was already pretty deep. After watching this film though,it's now touching the sky. Raw and intense and gorgeously shot and paced. I literally could not take my eyes off it. If you're a fan of genres such as horror,thrillers,or suspense,you'd be crazy not to add this to your cart. Buy it now!!!!",1456444800,3,477,4.759036144578313
7538977,3,B0182YCOHM,"Dr. Ryan Andrews (Denton Blane Everett) goes rogue when he removes a mental patient, Darcy (Tiffany Heath) from her safe environment and takes her back to her home where she was abused by mother. Darcy sleep walks and has a number of issues with hurting herself. Ryan uses hypnosis and regression therapy in addition to this shock immersion against the wished of his colleagues who we only know through low budget phone conversations.

While at the disheveled home, they discover Sam, a mute feral boy who knows more than he lets on, but also drops clues. About midway through the film we get the twist in the making and the film improves from its slow piano soundtrack. Unfortunately the first half of the film was flat and unexciting. Denton Blane Everett was horrible and lifeless in this role. I didn't understand how the abandoned house still had electricity as well as all the horse metaphors which was vital to enjoying this feature.

The film includes scenes of self mutilation and implies torture. I found the film improving as it went on, but the three man play failed to generate decent horror.

7538987,5,B0182YCOHM,Watched this with my 15 year old daughter and her best friend. We read reviews on Amazon and other sites and decided to still give it a try. We loved it. Definitely worth the watch if you are into spookers (that's what we call them in our house) and psychological thrillers.,1466208000,,274,4.392156862745098
7538988,1,B0182YCOHM,"it was soooo slow. and with no background about any of the movie you start with a woman clearly messed up, drugs or demon who knows you finaly get to a mom who was nuttso but have to figure what is still happening. a little boy who doesnt talk but a moment actully tells you what the story is supposed to be about. but the boy spends most of the time never talking and when he does he just does it maybe 2 sentances. this isn't worth me correcting my spelling or typing on a very old keyboard that doesnt like typing some letters.",1466208000,2,530,4.105769230769231

7538993,2,B0182YCOHM,"This could have been an excellent film but it fell flat on its bruised face. It's not a psychological thriller, it's not really horror, it's not really even scary. The first half drags on and on before we finally learn that the subject of the film has multiple personality disorder. There are only three characters in the film and had the third not been invented, there would be no film at all. No explanation as to how the feral child who was locked inside a room managed to survive without food or water for who-knows-how-long. The film was poorly done from beginning to end and was a disappointment.",1465776000,2,602,4.583333333333333
7538994,5,B0182YCOHM,"After viewing. I was scared to go to bed. The direction and acting were top notch. I was truly horrified. A psychiatrist removes a patient from a facility, and takes her to her former residence in a last ditch effort to comes to terms with childhood abuse inflicted upon her by her mother.",1465689600,2,289,4.471698113207547
7538995,4,B0182YCOHM,"This film definitely lead me through many twists and turns. I found myself getting confused enough to google it after watching it, and seeing the interview, where Tiffany states that her film is ""Psycho meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" She definitely accomplished the goal and blended the two genres together perfectly in this piece. Being a fan of art house style filming, this movie wanders over into that category with a multi-layered mystery beneath the surface that continues to galvanize all the way up to its rather shocking conclusion. I also think that it is one of those films that require viewing more than once with the symbolism, somewhat obscure explanations as to what is taking place and leaving the viewer with more than a few questions. I am definitely going to watch this one again. Normally a film that jumps around like this one did can get on my nerves, but the rather choppy editing in scenes really enhances the overall mood of the film. Best way to describe it would be arthouse cinema meets Psycho meets Texas Chainsaw. Tiffany will definitely be someone to follow, judging by the information I have found on her. The passion for horror really shines.",1465603200,2,1176,4.855721393034826
7538996,4,B0182YCOHM,One very twisted movie! Keeps you guessing til the end. And one messed up ending at that!!,1465603200,,90,4.352941176470588
7538997,3,B0182YCOHM,Decent Film. The acting was okay. Sound quality was not that great. Plot was a little bit shaky. Needed more information and a better explanation for certain scenes. I see the good intention and thought that was put into the film. A film with a plot this complicated needed a lot more effort put into it. Much was left to the imagination. Overall decent.,1465430400,2,354,4.546875
