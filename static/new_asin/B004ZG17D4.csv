4508984,5,B004ZG17D4,"If you saw the Lazarus Project and came away thinking it was as disappointing a piece of crap as I did, there is no more cause for sorrow, for I present to you, gracious ladies and gentlemen of the Amazon Marketplace a miracle of a film, Frankenstein  Syndrome, which in every way meets and exceeds the expectations that the aforementioned embarrassment to the talent of Olivia Wilde set for itself and then spectacularly failed to meet. If you, like me, went to see the Lazarus Project and wondered why it is that Hollywood seems to have decided that some people in a studio named Blumhouse should have a sort of de facto dominance on the big screen as America's main source of horror, rest assured, the movie Frankenstein Syndrome long ago proved the indispensable value of independent horror. All the pretenses to actual philosophical thought that the Blumhouse people pussyfoot around in their very ratings-conscious way are actually met head on with brutal honesty here, rest assured. Compared, you see, to the main event of Frankenstein Syndrome, the Lazarus Project to me was nothing more than an unwanted distraction, a crumpled up napkin on the floor of the cinema, if you will, that I regret to say momentarily distracted me from the actual horror movie I was wanting to pay attention to. Blumhouse gang, please let me know when you get the Insidious franchise back on track, I'm tired of waiting.",1411776000,2,1407,4.838174273858921
4508985,5,B004ZG17D4,This ended up being really entertaining. The dialogue between the scientists seemed well acted and somewhat realistic. I would say this is worth a buy or at least a rental.,1382486400,,172,4.766666666666667
4508986,3,B004ZG17D4,"This film is more akin to ""Re-animator"" than Frankenstein. Dr. Elizabeth Barnes (Tiffany Shepis) is being interviewed by Agent Wollstonecraft (Shane Dean) and Agent Godwin (Esther Ellsworth) in an attempt to give us clever names. Elizabeth is a microbiologist. She joins a group of elite scientists to perform illegal embryonic stem cell research.

They create a serum that cures everything and then experiment on Dave, (Scott Anthony Leet)a dead patient, or formerly dead patient who posed for the cover. He develops unusual powers...aka Gary Mitchell for you Trekkies. The group of doctors have disagreements to add some internal conflict to the script, because simply bringing dead people back to life is never enough to hold our attention.

The film was interesting but lacked entertainment in the dry dialouge.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity.",1350691200,,860,5.355555555555555
4508987,5,B004ZG17D4,This is one of those movies that never made main stream theater.  Overall a very good movie with high quality acting and good special effects.  I feel this is going to be a future cult classic,1338508800,4,192,4.305555555555555
4508988,3,B004ZG17D4,"3.5 stars of 5.
The acting, cinematography, special effects, and production were very good allowing one to overlook leaps of faith in the story.
I didn't know anything about this movie except what the tv guide blurb revealed when I pressed the info button on the remote. I wasn't expecting this kind of movie. The opening of the movie is the kind that draws you in immediately, just like Scream. Then you fill in the back story. What if you did create life; and, it had unforeseen, messianic consequences.
The story was an fascinating twist on the belief that the development of our technology has outstripped the development of our morality.",1332288000,5,642,4.792792792792793
4508989,3,B004ZG17D4,"I saw ""The Frankenstein Syndrome"" for the first time today (2am 12/12/2011).  The big ""what-if"" for me:

""What if it is more than a man, able to utilize more of his brain than the rest of us""?

Well, the few of us that have watched this movie found out!

True, it was lacking in the area of special-effects, but that really didn't detract from the film (in my opinion).

Honestly, I don't ever plan on buying it, but found it entertaining, nonetheless!

I rate ""The Frankenstein Syndrome""...3 stars!",1323648000,4,499,4.613636363636363
4508990,2,B004ZG17D4,"Where have I heard that before?

First of all, I'm getting tired of huge facilities with bad lighting.  Endless dark corridors don't automatically equate with horror, just unpaid electric bills.  And, as this was an illegal den of iniquity....I suppose everything came cheaply: the scientists/doctors and the research subjects (all disposable).  Since no one was worth saving, no need to care about any of the cast.  The story unfolds during a deposition, everything's already happened at that point so there aren't any surprises.  There's Ed Lauter as the mysterious head of this project (he's rarely onscreen).  He has a gun toting trigger happy henchman, Louis Mandylor (with an intermittent accent).  The rest of the cast is unknown and displays varying degrees of ability (from bad to worse).  Things only turned remotely interesting when the `Frankenstein' aspect of the story finally kicked in towards the end.  Otherwise, this type of story has been done better and often so there's really nothing here worth seeking it out.  Bland is the best term to describe this endeavor.",1315180800,,1083,5.166666666666667
4508991,1,B004ZG17D4,"Right off the bat this movie screamed shoe sting budget. I thought it would have some gore, but sadly not much. Not many cool effects at all. If it was dumbed down we could say Sci Fi channel special.",1314230400,,200,4.153846153846154
4508992,5,B004ZG17D4,"I was prepared to watch this and expect a trite, typical horror film, you know....blood, scary music, etc.
But I found I was drawn into the character development, excellent acting, story line....and then the science fiction/horror component.  Loved the use of a sparse setting, lending better to the story than just being dazzled with fancy camera action, and no substance.  The sparseness of the setting lent nicely to the overall tone of the story.  Very entertaining, worth my money/time and doing this review.  And I liked the characters!
Highly recommend this to all those who like science fiction, horror films!!!",1308528000,3,619,5.16

4508994,5,B004ZG17D4,"of the potential dangers of playing God, especially with Stem Cell research. Fictionalized, but thoughtful messages abound throughout this film. Great acting from beginning to end, but especially from Mr. Leet.

More than just your everyday slasher, this one is well worth watching.",1480464000,2,282,5.558139534883721

4508996,5,B004ZG17D4,"I found this film as a movie recommendation after watching the Green Room. It was definitely enjoyable and worth watching, more than once, which I did. Highly Recommended.",1479772800,,171,5.142857142857143

4509001,1,B004ZG17D4,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I bought it only because a friend of mine had a small part in it. The plot was predictable, the acting amateurish and overall it was just a terrible film.",1443139200,,204,4.0
4509002,5,B004ZG17D4,"A film that will leave you questing the difference between medicine and a stronger being. Great Film, but make sure to watch yourself, as you may be left asking more questions than you bargained for.",1416096000,,199,4.714285714285714
8449734,5,B004ZG17D4,"Honestly, I watched this because of my infatuation with Tiffany Shepis. I have sat through She Wolf Rising and Bloody Murder 2 because she was in it.  I had 0 expectations for anything remotely good.  So I was shocked when I found myself still paying attention 20 minutes in.  If anything, I felt the climax was a bit rushed.  That does not take away that this was well written, acted (by every actor) and directed.  Especially if you consider how these low budget films usually turn out.  It is no Psycho, but is well worth a one time watch.  I gave 5 stars because compared to other films in the horror genre with similar budgets and production values, it is a masterpiece.  You can't rate it based off expectations from a larger budget, major studio production.  But if you just go in wanting to be entertained for an hour and a half without having your intelligence insulted, deal with bad acting, even worse dialogue, and horrible CGI; I think you might have a good time too.",1505260800,,980,4.5227272727272725

8449736,4,B004ZG17D4,"The last I'd heard the word ""Serum"" was in a 1950's horror film.  The plot has a serious credibility probable as well.  The writers would have you believe that a squashed Caterpillar could be brought back to it's original shape, form and function with a single dose of the ""Serum"".",1484179200,,281,4.6
8449737,3,B004ZG17D4,"An interesting take on the Frankenstein concept with heavy Reanimator overtones is spoiled by an unsatisfactory ending.  I was left less than satisfied by a movie with no resolution.  The ending felt like a TV pilot, leaving much of the story to be told in future episodes.",1483056000,,273,4.787234042553192

8449740,3,B004ZG17D4,"I generally enjoy horror flicks, but didn't have high expectations for this one because Prime horror films on Amazon often aren't that good. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a decent horror film. The plot was solid, the acting was decent, it had some scares and the main ""monster"" was pretty creepy at times. This may not be an all-time classic, but if you like horror films you'll probably find this to be a fun watch,",1481587200,,439,4.5
8449741,4,B004ZG17D4,"It wasn't a bad movie. The actors and plot had some substance. I might still consider this a B rated movie, but I've seen so much worse. It had a kind of open-ended ending that could lead in multiple directions.",1481500800,,211,4.3
