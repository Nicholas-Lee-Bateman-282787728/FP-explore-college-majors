8041082,3,B0006BB7BY,least I now know that this will be a wasted trip for me.,1428710400,,56,3.3846153846153846
8041083,1,B0006BB7BY,"The video was not that informative.  The visuals were ok, but I didn't learn much of anything for our upcoming trip.",1394150400,,116,4.523809523809524
8041084,1,B0006BB7BY,"Don't waste your money on this.  Trust me, the second the DVD was finished I threw it away because I know I'll never watch it again.",1291766400,,132,4.076923076923077
8041085,1,B0006BB7BY,"We love Jennifer Saunders and bought this video because we thought she had something to do with a place we love, i.e., the Yucatan. Well, she ain't here. Search for Jennifer Saunders and you will find that (according to Amazon) she is also part of ""Girls Gone Wild"" video and something about a nude female wrestler. It might be interesting and entertaining is she were, but that's not the case. Get it together, Amazon, and gimme my money back!",1200009600,,444,4.632911392405063
8041086,5,B0006BB7BY,Great DVD for learning the ropes and getting the inside scoop on what to do and where to go.  Ended up saving LOTS of time and money on our trip. The footage was so real (and gorgeous!!!). Akumal actually looked just like the DVD showed...not like the run-of-the-mill garbage you can get from travel brochures.  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!,1163548800,4,332,4.610169491525424
8041087,5,B0006BB7BY,"I'm so glad I watched this video before I went to the ""Mayan Rivera"" area for vacation and R&R. It not only turned me on to some great places to drink and eat, but also helped me to find some really cool places to stay without wasting time and money learning where not to stay. I was especially glad to learn in advance about the customs and expectations when it comes to transportation and the the pitfalls one might suffer when unaware. Great Video and Vacation planning tool. Definitely Thumbs UP !!!",1163289600,2,503,4.478260869565218
8041088,5,B0006BB7BY,"Having vacationed in Akumal for the past eleven years I was so impressed by the way the makers of this DVD hit the nail on the head!  Though it has grown in tourism over the years, Akumal is still a place you can have a laid back and even primitive vacation if you know the right tips!  These guys have definitely spent some time down there!",1163289600,3,341,4.151515151515151
8041089,5,B0006BB7BY,"I have been to the Yucatan coast numerous times and have taken many friends during that time, I have to say that Akumal is one of our favorite spots!  It is truly a gem on a coast dominated by heavy tourism and big Americanized resorts.  I only wish I would have had this DVD ten years ago, as many of their ""trip tips"" for travelers in Mexico I learned the hard way.  VERY HELPFUL!  The footage is great, it is such a beautiful area and the dvd depicts it wonderfully.  With this dvd you know exactly what you are getting and exactly what to do when you plan a trip to Akumal, like a personal tour guide!  Loved it!",1163030400,2,616,4.1344537815126055
8041090,1,B0006BB7BY,"Very poor footage, you will hardly see any natural view of this beautiful region. It's all about U.S. tourists looking for all the facilities they're used to, shops selling U.S. junk food ... They always show you tourists drinking, eating, sailing, riding ...

Where is the ""paradise"", the ""best kept secret"" in all that?

Mexico is not that, Yucatan is not that!",1159142400,4,363,4.838709677419355
8041091,5,B0006BB7BY,"I recieved Akumal: Paradise in Mexico a couple months ago and I have watched it many times,it is just beautiful. It also has tons of GREAT information  -- I don't think we will be wasting any of our precious time trying to figure out what to do , where to go or how to get there! I get so excited to see the Akumal area every time I watch it, can't wait!!! Worth every penny ....",1100131200,,379,3.986842105263158
