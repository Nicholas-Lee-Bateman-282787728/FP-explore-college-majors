8082185,5,B000B66GUQ,This is probably one of the best of the versions of 'La Llorona'.  It has a cast of excellent early Mexican actors from the 'Epoca de Oro'.  It is not gory or bloodthirsty but very entertaining on those nights when you want to cuddle up to a loved one and enjoy a great movie.,1428278400,,276,4.092592592592593
8082186,5,B000B66GUQ,"Spanish dialog. This is a classic Mexican horror film. I first saw this movie in the late fifties. Scary then, entertaining now. The movie refers to the Old Mexican folk tale ""The LLORONA"". A tale in which a  woman in spurned by her lover and in a fit of emotional madness kills their two children. She is then cursed for all time to search for her missing children, wailing loudly in despair into the night. This curse unfortunately is visited upon the future generations of the first born male child of her lovers blood line whom she kills. This is a good movie for those you who enjoy the old classic genre. You won't be disappointed.",1282089600,6,637,4.491379310344827
8082187,5,B000B66GUQ,I saw this when i was ten and have always remembered it.  This is classic story-telling.,1263686400,4,88,4.5
8082188,5,B000B66GUQ,"The movie is an interesting view of one of the many variations of the ""Llorona"" legend of M&eacute;xico. In this case it is how the ""Llorona"" appears to each generation of the descendants of the actual movie characters colonial event that started the whole curse and damnation of the main character.

As I mentioned there are other variations of the story, but this one was interesting. There is another that was created in the 1930's (around 1939 I believe) that has been next to impossible to find.

This is a good black and white picture of the 50's era with an intersting narrative at the beginning of the story.

Enjoy.",1261958400,7,624,4.654545454545454
8082189,1,B000B66GUQ,Unfortunately this is one of those films that have a good title and cover but with a boring plot line and storyline. I watched it only once and I could not ever see it again. I hope those who view it do enjoy unlike me.,1231286400,2,219,3.888888888888889
