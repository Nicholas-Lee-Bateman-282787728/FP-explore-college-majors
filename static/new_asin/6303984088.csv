Many of his comments were designed for an adult to  get without the child noticing.  The story had some good lessons in it,  though we could have seen more of Jasmine.  Robin Williams makes this movie  great.",916876800,3,379,4.3

752223,2,6303984088,"This could have been such a wonderful Bluray,but Disney disappoints once again. It's a good copy on 1080ips but those CHEAP grubbers at Disney released this in 1.0 MONO !!!!! Now,don't throw away your DVD that has a 5.1 surround sound track. This was made for the DVD release. Either the people at Disney making Blurays arn't very smart or they are ""sapping"" the Disney Movie Club members into buying this only to release the newer
5.1 Dolby Surround Sound perhaps at a later date?Anyway,I'm not a member of Disney Movie Club so I pay a PREMIUM price for the Blurays on Amazon & eBay. Honestly,If I knew that I was buying a recently made Disney Bluray with a MONO SOUNDTRACK FROM 1950,I would have just kept my DVD.Read the VERY small print on back of Bluray 1.0 mono.

753137,3,6303984088,"In some ways this is 101 Dalmatians light -- abducted animals, an evil villain, a happy home they are trying to get back to, an adventure along the way. It was made nine years after the original 101 Dalmatians and it seems like Disney was trying to recapture the magic. But the villain here is no great character like Cruella de Vil, just a kind of generic greedy butler. And the home they are returning to seems to be more about returning to a comfortable wealthy lifestyle away from their ""slumming"" experience with the ally cats, then the theme of reuniting family in 101 Dalmatians.

That being said, the things that this movie does have going for it is a couple of good songs and a slightly looser ""jazz inspired"" animation style that does give it some freshness even today.",1510963200,,779,4.564285714285714

I actually have the previous DVD and had the VHS from 1996 prior to that. On the tape (and this is obviously from the original film from 1970) I seem to remember in the opening scene  Edgar casually tossing Toulouse, who has been pestering him, over his shoulder back to Madame.
But on the DVD (the one I have anyway) he just passes the kitten over to her; Was Disney afraid that kids would start throwing kittens around???",1497225600,,551,4.247619047619048

756192,5,6303984088,"I grew up with this movie and still enjoy it to this day. There isn't a whole lot of special features but the 30 minute Walt Disney program about cats. I wish it would have featured the full one hour special but it was still enjoyable. The animation has been cleaned up with a HD make-over and the colors are very vibrant.

As for the movie itself, it is considered a classic. Many school choirs around the country still sing ""Everybody wants to be a cat"" and I guess it never gets old. Depends on who you talk to. As for the story, it is original and keeps you interested. You can tell it was animated in the 70s due to the vibrant tye-dye colors and one of the cats is wearing rose colored glasses.",1470960000,2,700,4.185185185185185

756196,4,6303984088,"Despite the animation looking dated, it's a pretty good movie and I'd have to say it's a hidden gem in a time when the quality of Disney movies began to drop. The music's pretty good, the characters are likable, and the story-while pretty basic and formulaic-is easy to follow. With many Disney movies in the last two decades dominating our lives, this movie is an underrated gem that's worth a look",1470441600,,399,4.633802816901408

Great performances sumptuously photographed in exhilarating 3-strip Technicolor. Less impressive - a modicum of edge enhancement and a tad of image sharpening, resulting in occasionally distracting halos. They come and go and overall, this disc looks fantastic. It could have looked better, however. No extras - an unforgivable sin from Disney. Otherwise, recommended!!!",1469404800,2,543,5.9743589743589745

756523,2,6303984088,"I love Treasure Island, it was my favorite movie growing up as a kid.  And while it was nice to get a blu-Ray release that adds picture resolution over the previous DVD release, what was NOT nice was the fact that Disney didn't even bother to restore the movie for its 65th Anniversary release, and there's no extras on this blu-Ray at all. The film print that was used for this transfer is seemingly unrestored, and appears to be a copied film print positive that has image focus issues on the right side of the print. I can tell because the image has less resolution as if it is out of focus, BUT, the film grain is Judd as sharp on the right as it is on the left. They should have restored the original negative print. They didn't.

Overall, disappointed in the film transfer, it could've been considerably better.",1467417600,5,817,4.44

757900,4,6303984088,"This movie was a really cute one, and I feel like some of these reviews are a bit harsh. Yes, the story is pretty simple, but its still a very enjoyable movie, I was smiling along and just had a good time watching it. Young kids will enjoy the movie so very much, and while adults may not get into it as much as say The Lion King or Up, it definitely isn't as bad as having to watch a movie that is only targeted for children, like a Thomas the Tank Engine movie or Barney.

But the reason I gave it only 4 stars was mainly because of the cringe inducing character that is the Chinese cat. I'm really surprised that it hasn't been mentioned in other reviews, but oh my goodness I was cringing every time that character was onscreen, and just hoping he wouldn't talk afterwords. The other alley cats seemed to be other ethnicities, but they didn't really have outlandish accents or were extremely stereotypical (besides the hippie cat, but that isn't an ethnicity). The Chinese cat pronounced L's like R's, had huge buck teeth that the cats in Lady and the Tramp didn't have and played instruments with chopsticks. I get that this was from a long time ago where I'm sure it wasn't seen as a problem, but that character just aged poorly some 40 years later. It may seem harsh to rate this movie one star lower just because of one minor character, but it left such a poor taste in my mouth after watching the movie, that it offset a lot of the sweet and cute feelings this movie had initially had me feeling.

But I must admit I will probably watch this movie again, as it is overall very cute and the animation is great to look back at, but I wouldn't recommend letting children over 5 or 6 watch this, as I think the stereotype's will become more apparent, versus a small child who wouldn't really understand what is going on or understand stereotypes. Case in point I had watched this as a young kid, and re-watching it as an adult, I didn't remember any of the cats besides the main 5 very well.",1457395200,10,1996,4.334224598930481

758071,4,6303984088,"The Aristocats falls into the 2nd tier of Disney Animated movies.  It's not a masterpiece by Disney standards, but the movie stands on it's own as a Fantastic movie.
What makes it great:
The voice Cast:  Phil Harris and Eva Gabor are the showcase talents, and they should be as they are perfectly cast.  Others who shine are Sterling Holloway and Scatman Crothers.

The Music:  Disney takes a different direction with this music using more of a jazz sound in several places.  Something that was unique for a Disney film at the time.

Why it's not a Masterpiece:
The animation:  It was ok.  I'm sure for the time period it was very trendy, but the rough drawing look has not stood the test of time, to me at least.

the plot:  Aristocats has a strong resemblance to 101 Dalmations.  While this is not fair considering the ARistocats is based on a story by Tom Rowe.  But if you have seen both movies the comparisons are easy to make and 101 is better in every way(accept maybe the music).

761453,4,6303984088,"This is the last animated feature to be approved of by Disney, who died in 1966.  It took seven writers to adapt this from a story by Tom McGowan & Tom Rowe.  Considering the simple nature of the plot, one wonders why it took so many to come up with so little.  The story involves a rich woman who plans to leave her great wealth to her cat Duchess.  Her butler Edgar will receive what's left after the cat(s) die.  He resents waiting and decides to hurry the process by abandoning the cats as far from Paris as his motorcycle will take them.  With the help of a stray cat named O'Malley, they make it back to Paris in time to be intercepted by Edgar who's more than happy to make another attempt to remove his competition.

There are a few songs, the artwork is loose (like watercolor with pen and ink), there's a mouse sidekick who sounds exactly like Winnie the Pooh, it's all handled breezily.  But.  There are quite a few things that don't make any sense.  Why are there two (supposedly French) dogs named Napoleon and Lafayette who have decidedly American accents (no surprise considering they were voiced by Pat Buttram and George Lindsey).  There are quite a few ""name"" actors voicing the parts using a multitude of conflicting accents: Vito Scotti, Nancy Kulp, Paul Winchell, Scatman Crothers, Sterling Holloway, Phil Harris, Hermione Baddeley, and Eva Gabor.  And strangely enough, they also depict Paris as a ghost town on at least two occasions, as though there isn't any night life in the city after a certain hour.

This movie feels like a rough draft that was hurried into production (even though it took four years to complete).  It just doesn't have the polish one expects from a Disney cartoon.  Still, it's amusing; the songs are good, so it's entertaining enough without being a classic.",1417132800,,1807,4.65615141955836

In this film Duchess(Gabor)and her three kittens are named heirs to the estate of a wealthy and kind-hearted french opera star, but when the butler kidnaps Duchess and her kittens as revenge, word spreads throughout Paris and catches the ear of a friendly but tough alley cat named Thomas O'Malley(Harris), and he and his alley cat jazz band comes to the rescue of Duchess and outwit the evil butler. The DVD special features include interactive games, a classic Disney short featuring Figaro(the little kitten from Pinocchio), A 1956 Disney TV episode called the Great Cat Family, and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like Tinker Bell and the Secret Of The Wings, a teaser trailer for PIXAR's Planes, and Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3.

True, their stuff from that period was allegorical in nature and of lower quality animation but the plots were definitely better; this period ranged from about early 1960's (101 Dalmatians) through the late 70's (Rescuers) into the mid-80's (Great Mouse Detective) was their high point, especially for the toddler and under crowd.
  May the animals are easier for the younger set to relate to, or the more spare animation holds them better without too much CGI visual clutter....(movies like Valiant and Bolt hold him for about 5-10 minutes, tops....) Among these The AristoCats ranks as his favourite. Its a good, clean, fun movie with catchy tunes. It has good moral stories woven in too for adults to ponder but isn't heavy handed or preachy about it unlike some of their latter fare which weave in sexual innuendo and/or violence to keep the beyond toddler set.",1395878400,3,1041,4.942857142857143

All the characters from this film were just so cute and endearing, I loved them all.

The animated movies done by the Disney company during the sixties and the seventies were both cute and funny (And quite underrated as well) and this movie wasn't the exception, being one of my favorite movies of all the time. It was incredibly enjoyable from beginning to end.

The animation was quite good, with beautiful sceneries and a pleasant character design. It also have catchy songs and nice music. All those qualities are enough to make this film a delightful experience for the whole family.

An underrated classic film from Disney, that deserves way more appreciation and love.",1395446400,,722,4.9421487603305785

They are terrific companions, friends you can trust, quiet, clean, and not dangerous to people. Plus, if you are a musician like I am, they love music and never interrupt your rehearsals! Because they are so independent, they are not easy to handle in the production of movies and, as a result, they are featured a lot more often in cartoons. You must not forget that the first cartoon superstar was a cat, Felix the Cat, later imitated by Disney when creating Mickey Mouse!

763234,3,6303984088,"In 1920s France an eccentric Duchess plans to leave her estate to her privileged kitties (Cattingtons?). Her nefarious, Prince Charles-lookalike butler overhears her plans and schemes to have the cats disappeared. He drugs them, for some reason, and dumps them in the countryside. Surely a quick warm up in the oven would have been a more foolproof plan. And why even bother disposing of the cats? Surely getting rid of the Duchess should be his first priority. I mean she could potentially live for another 25 years.

Once out in the French countryside they meet up with jiving, self-confident stray Tom (that's an original name for an animated cat) who makes it his mission to take them back to Paris. He's basically a feline Baloo. He's even voiced by Phil Harris. Along the way they meet various characters and eventually confront the Butler who plotted against them.

If it sounds familiar that's because it's basically a rewritten version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-s-Jungle-Book/dp/B00EFYGX5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney's Jungle Book</a>. It even has King Louie type of jazz cat. This isn't really a bad thing, but it lacks the necessary spark to make it a classic. The animation is colorful and the period French setting provides some lovely backgrounds. It's just not anything too special, sadly.

The Blu-ray looks great in 1.66:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a good amount of extras including classic Disney short ""Bath Day"", in HD, featuring Minnie and Figaro the Cat. Worth getting, even if you don't insist on collecting all Disney animated features.",1380499200,,1638,5.415686274509804

763338,4,6303984088,"Disney Studios 20th full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Aristocats is a decent entry into the Disney animated film cannon with some memorable characters, but the new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

While this isn't Disney at it's best it is enjoyable. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone but not quite as polished as it is in Jungle Book. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release was released in full screen and the second in 1:75:1 and the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which seems to work well as the film doesn't appeared cramped. It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyer have more options for playback. The restoration looks impressive, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in come areas. I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic.

If you must own The Aristocats, then the Blu Ray is the way to go",1379462400,2,1939,4.5501432664756445

The little kittens are so cute, they all have so much character.  Great characters is what makes this movie, it's not like the animation is as beautiful as some other disney masterpieces, it's a more rough style of animation like ""101 Dalmatians "".  Catchy songs.  Can't wait to see how good the blu-ray looks.  Story may not be the best for little ones, but they do it in such a way that I don't think they would notice or be offended, but I'm not a kid, so the butler and his bad intentions may bother someone.",1374105600,,657,4.258064516129032

Another Disney classic-- lovable characters and interesting relationships between them. The plot on this one is a bit silly in that 'the butler' wishes to send the cats away so he can get the inheritance left to him contingent on the cats living out thier lives. Of course, why would he care if the cats are around? He'll be there enjoying the material comforts of the wealthy benefactor while enjoying the simple duty of taking care of them. But hey, it's primarily for kids and for those of us who appreciate such light hearted entertainment. The voices were well chosen, Omalley the alley cat sounds like a very cool and street wise but trustworthy dude.

764873,4,6303984088,"""The Aristocats"", one of Disney's cute, fun, classic animated films that will no doubt entertaining generation after generation.

In 1970, the 20th Walt Disney Animated Classic was released in theaters.  The film, ""The Aristocats"", would be known as the last film project that Walt Disney approved before his death in 1966 and a film that would feature Disney's longtime legendary talent known as the  ""Nine Old Men"".

Featuring talents such as Eva Gabor, singer Phil Harris and English actor Roddy Maude-Roxby, the film would be an enormous success that year. Budgeted at $4 million, ""The Aristocats"" would earn over $55 million in the box office.

And now, the classic Disney animated film was released in HD for the first time on Blu-ray in August 2012.

VIDEO:

""The Aristocats"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  This is one of the classic Disney films to feature Disney's legendary ""Nine Old Men"" and has a unique style as the characters look as they are hand drawn, as the outlines of the pencil strokes can be seen on the cats.

The detailed and beautiful backgrounds also reflect a sketch style mostly evident indoors, but outdoors, it's Disney magic as the backgrounds look fantastic!  These outdoor animated scenes are where you can see most of the detail and the vibrancy of the film.  While the film does seem like an older animated film in presentation with its hint of softness, this is the best version of ""The Aristocats"" that I have seen so far.

The picture quality is quite clean, there are no blemishes, artifacts or dust that I saw when I was watching the film.  Overall, I was impressed by how great this film looks on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Aristocats"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. The film is primarily dialogue and music-driven and thus more center/front channel. Dialogue and lossless audio is crystal clear with a little use of the surround channels but there is use of LFE (as it can be heard a bit clearly during the train sequence). But overall, the lossless soundtrack is good and I hear no pops or any audio problems during my viewing of the film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Aristocats"" comes with the following special features:

  The Lost Open - (9:31) Richard Sherman talks about the deleted character Elvira and two deleted songs which are presented in this special feature.
  ""Oui Oui Marie"" Music Video - (1:53) A modernized remix featuring little cat, Marie's quotes.
  Classic Deleted Song: ""She Never Felt Alone"" - (7:56) A featurette on how the Sherman Brothers came up with ""She Never Felt Alone"".
  The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs - (4:20) A featurette on the Sherman Brothers and their collaboration with Disney.
  The Aristocats Scrapbook - A gallery of images from ""The Aristocats"".
  The Great Cat Family (Excerpt) - (12:51) An animated short on ""The Great Cat Family"".  Original air date on Sept. 19, 1956.
  Bonus Short: Bath Day - (6:39) An animated short featuring Figaro.
  Play Movie with On-Screen Lyrics - Ability to have a karaoke-style singalong during the film (for music segments only).
  Disney Song Selection - (10:44) Featuring the song selections for ""The Aristocats"", ""Scales and Arpeggios"", ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"", ""Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat"".
  Disney Virtual Kitten - Adopt your own Virtual Kitty.  Featuring two mini games and your very own printable adoption license.
  The Aristocats Fun with Language Game - Play along and learn the names and sounds of a variety of musical instruments.

EXTRAS:

""The Aristocats"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of both films.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first watched ""The Aristocats"" as a child, I think anyone who watched it, just felt the cats were so cute, especially hearing little Marie talk and sing or seeing oldest kitten, Toulouse trying to be a tough kitten, while little Berlioz is shy.  But for the most part, it's a straightforward story about a cat and her kittens lost in the middle of nowhere, in the countryside outside of Paris.  And the hero, Thomas O'Malley willing to help Duchess and her kittens get back home.

But during the process through their adventures of returning home, Thomas and Duchess fall in love and even the kittens start to take a liking towards Thomas, as if he was their father.

""The Aristocats"" is a fun, yet short animated film that families will love.  Granted, it is a little dark when you read that Edgard the Butler is trying to kill the cats, but the way it is presented in the film, it's more comical and there is no scenes that show any violence.  If anything, Egard is quite inept, so aside from the cats falling off the car and being stranded in the countryside, there are no scenes of any abuse that parents need to worry about.

It's a safe, straightforward family film that a new generation of fans or the young at heart can enjoy.

As for the Blu-ray release, the film looks absolutely wonderful in HD.  This is an older 1970 animated film and while there is a hint of softness which is appropriate for a film this old, the film also showcases a unique style to it.  From the heavy strokes outside of the characters and everything looking sketched but yet colorful and well-detailed when it comes to objects and scenery, ""The Aristocats"" looks great on Blu-ray and dialogue and music are crystal clear.  The Blu-ray release also features quite a few songs and featurette including a bonus animated short of ""Bath Day"".

Also, included along with this Blu-ray release is a DVD version of the film, which is great for vacation time and parents wanting to keep their kids occupied at home or during a commute.

Overall, ""The Aristocats"" is an easily accessible film for children and it's not too long (at 78-minutes).  Safe, fun and a family film that will entertain generation after generation, ""The Aristocats"" is a classic Disney animated film that looks and sounds great in HD via Blu-ray.  For Disney collectors or parents wanting a fun family film, ""The Aristocats"" is recommended!",1354320000,2,6146,4.850961538461538

765053,4,6303984088,"This is my example of a simple Disney film done right! It's not too spectacular or intense, it's just supposed to be a really good movie about cats. I like cats, and if this is the only cat movie I really get sucked into. George Bruns' musical score is as great as always, the villain is up to no good, but not sadistic or brutal, just following a simple plan to get money from his wealthy mistress. My 2 favorite parts of this movie are the dogs' motorcycle chase scene, and the other is Thomas O'Malley's fight with Edgar. I realyl like how this climax is not intense, just an animal attacking a man. This is what the climax to ""101 Dalmatians"" should have been like.  I also like how Duchess and O'Malley are alot like Lady and Tramp; a female domestic pet meeting a male love interest on the street, carefree, but becoming a couple in the female's home. Personally, I still really enjoy this movie.",1351209600,5,902,4.401197604790419
765054,2,6303984088,"Between the 'classic' Disney animated era ('Sleeping Beauty', 'Alice In Wonderland', 'Peter Pan', '101 Dalmations' etc.) and the 'new' era ('Little Mermaid', 'Beauty & the Beast', 'The Lion King' etc.), there was a long period of animated indifference that nearly put the Disney Studio out of business.

""The Aristocats"" is typical of that era: poor (sketchy) animation, scripting aimed at ages 6-and-under and characters 'borrowed' from other, better Disney flicks.

My young daughter found enough in it to giggle all the way through; but, she also likes reruns of 'Scooby-Doo'. I found my teeth grinding  in anticipation of its ending.

'The Aristocats' has some redeeming aspects: nice voice-over work by Phil Harris (essentially doing a feline vamp on his 'Baloo the Bear' schtick from 'The Jungle Book'), Eva Gabor and the (always delightful) Sterling Holloway. On the other hand, having two 'Hee-Haw' hounds (Pat Buttram of 'Green Acres' and George Lindsey of 'The Andy Griffith Show') are jarring in the middle of a movie about French cats. Like I said, scripting was not a priority to the producers of this cartoon (as opposed to 'animated film').

If faced with a choice of viewing 'The Aristocats', or something like 'Scooby-Doo' or 'Pokemon', the Disney flick is the better bet. Other than that, I would avoid it altogether.",1350777600,,1335,5.162037037037037

765319,4,6303984088,"One of Disney's latest offerings on Blu-ray is the classic animated feature ""The Aristocats."" It's interesting that the Mouse House released two 1970s era films in the same month. This one boasts a jazzy soundtrack that will have viewers of all ages tapping their feet. It's of note that this was the last movie Walt Disney approved before his death in 1966.

The scheming butler of a rich Parisian socialite kidnaps her beloved mother cat and kittens after overhearing the woman's plans to leave her inheritance to the pets. A smooth-talking tomcat helps the high-society house cat and her family finds their way back home. They meet all kinds of interesting characters along the way.

This is standard Disney in all its shining glory. It promotes family and shows the audience that good always overcomes evil in the end. The story comes off as a ""101 Dalmatians"" for cat lovers, but doesn't completely duplicating it. The pacing is good and keeps the action moving forward.

The characters are all memorable and quirky in their own ways. Eva Gabor voices the feline Duchess with her usual refined Hungarian accent. Phil Harris is fabulously sassy as the free-spirited and swinging alley cat Thomas O'Malley. Scatman Crothers is perfectly cast as Scat Cat, the leader of an interracial jazz group.

The high-definition picture and audio will please Disney enthusiasts. All the colors are more vibrant than they've ever been. The 5.1 surround sound guarantees you'll hear every line of dialogue and every instrument strummed or banged on during the musical numbers.

Disney packed the Blu-ray edition full of bonus material. It features a lost opening sequence, the ""Oui Oui Marie"" music video, and a classic deleted song entitled ""She Never Felt Alone."" There are also featurettes including ""The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs"" and an excerpt from ""The Great Cat Family"" hosted by Walt Disney. It also contains the classic short bonus ""Bath Day,"" ""The Aristocats"" Scrapbook, and a language game. You can choose to play the movie with on-screen lyrics as well.

The 2-Disc Blu-ray + DVD Special Edition of ""The Aristocats"" is a must-have for every collector of Disney movies in a high-definition format. A new digital transfer and new special features makes it highly recommended. It's a true classic that fits perfectly next to ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Rescuers"" in your movie library.",1347235200,,2409,5.055415617128464
765320,5,6303984088,"The Aristocats was made after Walt Disney's death and was the first animated film without his involvement. His last film, The Jungle Book, released one year after his death was very well received and in the way to become a classic (which now is). The Aristocats, released in 1970 does not enjoy the same status as its predecessor but is still a perfectly nice family film with great characters, catchy songs and delightful antics. It may not be as polished or sentimental as previous Disney films but its still a great ride to enjoy multiple times.

Many things make The Aristocats a memorable adventure: The characters are charming and funny, none of them (including the children) are annoying. The voice cast is excellent and even though Phil Harris essentially channels Baloo into Thomas O'Malley, he's still a hoot. Another asset are the songs. Written and composed by the legendary team of Richard and Robert Sherman, the songs are catchy, invigorating and memorable (especially ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat""). The animation is nothing extraordinary but serves the film right.

All in all, The Aristocats may not be a masterpiece but is still tons of fun.

Video & Audio

The Aristocats looks excellent on BD. Disney has restored the film and the results are great. Detail is clear, the image is completely clean and the lines of look is still preserved. A very good transfer that easily surpasses all the previous Home Video releases.

Audio comes in the form of a 5.1 DTS-HD MA and delivers the goods. It may not be a bombastic experience but its a clean, stable and clear audio. You won't be disappointed.

Bonus Material

Due to the fact that this film is not very popular as other Disney films, extras are very slim but there's still some good things in here.

""The Lost Open"" is an all new, recently found deleted song. Introduced by composer Richard Sherman, the song was supposedly placed at the beginning of the film and had a character that was later deleted from the final cut. The song is nice, but I think is better it was cut off.

""Ouie, Ouie Marie"" is a pointless music video featuring the little female kitten.

""The Sherman Brothers, The Aristocrats of Disney Songs"" is a nice piece that honors the legendary duo and although is very short is a nice glimpse inside their creative process.

""She never felt Alone"" is another deleted song introduced by Richard Sherman

""Disney Song Selection""

""1956 Animated Special Excerpt"" is a TV special hosted by Walt Disney and dealing with cats. A wonderful piece.

""Bath Day"" is a short film featuring Figaro (from Pinocchio) and Minnie Mouse.

A DVD copy is also included.

Final Thoughts

The Aristocats in an obscure Disney movie that is absolutely delightful. This BD features stellar picture and sound and some nice bonus material. You'll definitely should check this one out!",1346976000,2,2845,4.832989690721649

I bought something from you and now you want me to take time to come up with a well written revieiw.  I don't owe you that. It was good and I loved it.  That's it.",1346889600,,247,3.6923076923076925
765322,5,6303984088,"It's funny I don't like cats, but I do love this movie.  It is an adorable tale of a two cats and adventure.  A millionaire leaves her inheritance to her cat, Duchess and her kittens, and the greedy butler decides he wants the money so he kidnaps Duchess.  An alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, and his friends jump in to save the day.  There are fun songs, adorable kittens, and just mischief in this movie.  It is a classic Disney movie and makes me laugh everytime I see it.  It actually reminds me of 101 Dalmations but with cats!

With the new Blu-ray edition you both the DVD and a Blu-ray disc, which I love because I keep the DVD in the car and Blu-ray in our family room.  The animation and sound have been remastered to update the movie, but it still has the classic animation from when it was originally released in the 1970.  There are also lots of Bonus Features available on the discs, which we haven't even had a chance to check them all out.  Overall, this is a great Blu-ray/DVD set to add to your collection!",1346889600,,1019,4.315789473684211
765323,4,6303984088,"The first Disney animated feature produced after Walt Disney's passing was 1970's The Aristocats. While it has never been held in the same esteem as Snow White, Fantasia, or even latter-day classics like Beauty and the Beast, it's a thoroughly entertaining romp that places characters and set pieces over a very basic plot reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp.

It's also a bit puzzling because it combines disparate voice acting performances from, among others, Hungarian Eva Gabor as a French cat, Pat Buttram and George Lindsey as country cornpone dawgs in rural France and even an elegant performance by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille -- a change of pace from her more familiar blustering Mary Poppins/Happiest Millionaire domestics or the bawdy Mrs. Naugatuck on TV's Maude.

What's loveliest about The Aristocats as a film, especially in the crisp light of Blu-ray on this new edition, is the masterful animation, captured in its spontaneous glory through the Xerox process, a method of copying pencil art directly onto animation cels in place of inking each line again.

As kids, we called this the ""scritchy lines"" type of animation -- not as clean and polished and at the time, not as preferable. But seeing it today in an age where even TV animation has a slickness and therefore a distancing perfection, this kind of animation is now precious and rare. On Blu-ray, you can really appreciate the lines as they vibrate in every motion. Not a nuance is lost.

Another fine aspect of The Aristocats is its score. Though not a musical in general, there are several fine songs by Terry Gilkyson, Floyd Huddleston, Al Rinker and especially the Sherman Brothers, who apparently created several songs left unused in the film. Richard Sherman is very much a presence on the bonus features (carried over from the previous DVD release and now primarily on the Blu-ray disc). Richard narrates an entire opening sequence that is very different from the one we know.

But from a Mouse Tracks perspective, the most fantastic thing about the bonus features is that they include mention of our beloved Robie Lester, who provided Eva Gabor's singing vocals for Duchess the cat. The appearance of these material on the DVD was the very first time her significant contribution was acknowledged and it's nice to know it's also here on the Blu-ray.",1346803200,3,2360,4.979695431472082
765324,3,6303984088,"Even if you keep this, do not sell your previously released DVD of this movie! They boosted the color and added harsher lines, so it lost the softness of the original drawings and the flavor of real life with the pumped-up colors. Really - the skin colors are bright pink instead of beige, for instance. The soft watercolors now look like harsh marker drawings. I bought this for the subtitles in other languages, since the DVD only had English, but regretted it when I saw how awful they made it look. I guess they realized that children prefer stronger contrasts and more primary colors, but the original is a work of art, even the slate roofs look romantic in the original. In the new version it's still cute but far less beautiful. Alas. To me this is one of the best Disney movies of all time. And, by changing the colors it's like we're trying to raise our kids to learn bad taste. I love Disney but does everything have to be the same? This movie was an inspired creation. Why not show THAT to kids?",1346544000,5,1006,4.413978494623656
765490,5,6303984088,My two year old just loves the Aristocats blu ray and I do as well. Wouldn't mind if she watched it every day (which she has since buying it)! The music is wonderful and catchy... The picture just lovely. A really timeless tale about belonging and finding the way home.,1346198400,,269,4.4
765491,4,6303984088,"Walt Disney was involved with the planning of this movie (back when it was originally to be a live-version TV movie); once he passed away, much of the plot and motivations were changed. According to some of the featurettes on the disc, economy was a major factor in keeping the animation simple, removing characters, plot twists, and a few songs. Although the economy can be very apparent (especially in the style of animation), it is still a very sweet movie. Imagine a melding of ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" for cats, and you would probably be able to figure out the storyline here. There are no nail-biting sequences nor extraordinarily evil villains, yet the resulting animated film is definitely endearing and full of memorable songs. Maurice Chevalier was coaxed out of retirement by the Sherman Brothers (details are in one of the extra segments) to sing the title song and none other than Louis Armstrong sings the wonderful fast-paced song, ""Everybody Wants to Be A Cat."" Phil Harris lends his voice to the lead male role of O'Malley the Alley cat (and duets with Louis on the previously mentioned song). Eva Gabor plays the female lead, Duchess, the mother of three kittens and apple of her wealthy mistress' eye, Adelaide (the voice of Hermoine Baddeley). I can't say enough positive things about Gabor; she has a subtlety of emotion, charm, and humanity that shines through her wonderful accent. Despite her character being spoiled by her mistress and obviously living a very pampered life, through Gabor's voice, you can also hear that Duchess is very wise to O'Malley's flirtatious ways.

Briefly, the story is of Duchess and her three kittens who live in pampered Parisian luxury with the elderly Adelaide until the greedy butler, Edgar, decides to kidnap the cats so that he can inherit all of Adelaide's wealth instead of the cats. Dumped far away in the country, it takes O'Malley the Alley Cat to help get them back to Adelaide's, but not without a few fun journeys along the way. Sterling Holloway is wonderful as the cat's unlikely pal and hero, Roquefort. The animation has a similar rough-sketch look to it that ""101 Dalmations"" did. The picture quality is crystal clear on Blu ray, as is the sound. Don't expect a whole lot of dynamic range from the soundtrack, other than during some of the chase sequences or the jazz song ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat.""

The extras appear to be pretty much the same from the previous DVD release, although the Blu-ray Disc (mercifully) doesn't have any of the games on it. ""Bath Day"" (6:38) is a cute Minnie Mouse cartoon with Figaro the cat. I really enjoyed the excerpt from a 1956 Wonderful World of Disney show (hosted by Walt himself) entitled ""The Great Cat Family"" (12:50) with a fun history of the cat, accompanied by some wonderful animation. Richard Sherman introduces a deleted song (""She Never Felt Alone""), accompanied by storyboard sketches and production drawings, using the original demo audio recordings. Sherman also talks about ""The Lost Open"" of the movie, which is an expanded version of what we currently see. One of the characters was written out due to economy and the action was definitely tightened up. Although I can't say the character is really missed, it is obvious that with all of the deletions from Walt's original intent, some of the richness of the original narrative is lost. Adelaide's strong bond to her cats is not quite as established because of the loss of the song ""She Never Felt Alone."" ""The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs"" (4:33) has both of the Sherman brothers (but mainly Richard) talking about how they created the memorable musical numbers for this animated feature. There is also an odd little ""Oui Oui Marie"" remix music video by Ditto thrown in, as well as the ability to sing-along with four different tunes from the film.

What's missing? Sure would have been nice to have an overall ""Making Of"" featurette, but still this is a solid release and an enjoyable movie.

If you already have the previous DVD release, then I can't necessarily say that you have to rush right out and purchase the Blu-ray upgrade. However, if you don't have a home video copy of this movie (or it's a VHS copy), then definitely purrrrrrrchase this version!

SPECS: Blu-ray Video: 1080p High Def/1.78:1 Blu-ray Audio: English, 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio; French and Spanish, 5.1 Dolby Digital",1346112000,6,4412,4.869507323568575
765492,3,6303984088,"PRE-SCHOOLERS WILL get the most fun out of Disney's animated story about an elegant mother cat, Duchess, and her three kittens from Paris, and their sassy country hero, a tomcat named O'Malley, voiced by Phil Harris. Eva Gabor provides the voice for Angora Duchess of the blue eyes and fluffy white tail, while Robie Lester gives her a singing voice.

Unfortunately, once past the age of five, more sophisticated palettes will enjoy the kitty antics found on [...] or in DreamWorks' ""Puss In Boots."" ""The Aristocats"" was made in the `70s at a time when animation was deemed suitable only for the very youngest. It was a strange statement coming from the studio that traditionally delivered groundbreaking animation such as ""Fantasia,"" ""Lady and the Tramp"" - whose story this film so resembles - ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" and other memorable favorites that appeal to young and old.

There are a few songs by the Sherman Brothers, Robert B. and Richard M., who also penned the score for ""Mary Poppins"" and its Oscar-Winner Best Song, ""Chim Chim Cher-ee."" They're amusing, especially ""Scales and Arpeggios,"" sung by Duchess and her kittens, and the opening title number. ""The Aristocats"" was the last song recorded by Maurice Chevalier, who was retired at the time of the Sherman's request. Richard describes how he got Chevalier to come out of retirement in the best extra, ""The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs."" Other extras include deleted scenes and a song, ""She Never Felt Alone,"" alternate story treatments, and a music video, ""Oui Oui, Marie.""

On the Blu-ray disc, we also get an excerpt, ""The Great Cat Family,"" from an old Disney TV show and a cartoon, ""Bath Day,"" with Figaro the kitten and Minnie Mouse.

Shifting to the DVD for other extras, we notice the big difference between the restored high-definition picture and its old DVD version. Colors are richer and brighter, definition is much better and dirt and scratches have mostly been removed for the Blu-ray. These two presentations, even while the HD version is not reference, are like day and night. The DVD duplicates a few extras found on the Blu-ray, a nice consideration for the non-upgraded player in the house. There are a few simple games and features, too, such as a Virtual Kitten that can be played as a DVD-ROM.

This story tells how the butler did it. Overhearing the terms of his mistress' will that leaves her fortune to her cats - and then to her butler - he decides to move things along by dumping the cats out in the country. It's O'Malley to the rescue, guiding Mama Duchess and her babies home to the mansion by way of songs, new friends and adventures.",1345939200,2,2665,4.822757111597374
765493,4,6303984088,"Not the best film Disney made.  After Walt's passing this was the next release after 1967's great ""The Jungle Book"".

More music work from The Sherman Brothers.

This was I say is more designed for kids only.  No outstanding characters.  The Marie character for girls.  The return of the late Phil Harris as O'Malley does not have the appeal of Baloo.

There are quite a few extras on both discs, nothing outstanding.  No Making of but you would not need one really for this film since not the top of Disney films.

Now, Disney is now going cheap on blu ray packages.  For the last few years they have been bending over backwards  to promote blu rays, but here as they did with the Pocahontas package & Rescuers packages we get plain jane discs with no artwork on them.

So, it is a good Disney movie certainly not the best.  Only fair package as Disney goes cheap again.",1345593600,,871,4.436708860759493

Save for one flickering speck in the earliest moments of the movie, the Aristocats looks like a brand new movie! The colors are bright and vibrant and full of life. The 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' scene is a shining example of what I mean!

765497,5,6303984088,"This is a review of the Bluray + DVD release.

The 1970 Disney animated film ""the Aristocrats"" is getting it's Bluray debut on August 21st. There are two new bonuses (in addition to the ones on the previous DVD releases) and one should be of interest to movie musicals collectors.

I haven't seen the film since its big-screen release and watching it again reminded me of why I enjoyed it the first time. While children will love the cute little cats, adults will appreciate the fine HAND DRAWN graphics. It really looks a lot different than even the other hand-drawn Disney films like ""Lady and the Tramp"". Maybe it is because it takes place in Paris, but I was quickly reminded of the art style of the 2003 non-Disney  animated musical film, ""The Triplets of Belleville"", directed by Sylvain Chomet. And the songs (composed by both the Sherman Brothers as well as Terry Gilkyson, with my favorite - ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" sung by Phil Harris and Scatman Crothers - composed by Al Rinker and Floyd Huddleston) are on more of an adult level.

The cast (well the voice cast) is great with Harris, and Eva Gabor being the most well known. And the title song is sung by the legendary Maurice Chevalier, who came out of performing retirement to make this - his last recording.

I don't have an HD TV but I can tell you it looks great on my Standard-def screen.

The film has been on DVD before (I didn't own it) but the 2012 release (both BD and DVD) have two NEW bonus features, one which is important; the other a ""throwaway"" in my opinion.

It's a nine-minute piece called ""The Lost Open"" which has Richard Sherman (one of the two Sherman Brothers who wrote Disney songs) introducing a two-part song that was to be the original opening for the film. It is called ""How Much You Mean To Me/ Court Me Slowly"" and is sung by the butler Edgar and a DELETED character (the maid). They found the original story boards and a demo recording by Sherman and his brother, Robert, and melded the two together.

The previous DVD had a deleted song ""She Never Felt Alone"" and that seven-minute piece is here too.

The only other new feature is a ""Oui Oui Marie"" Music video of a REMIX (you know the annoying drum track). That is a throwaway, I mentioned above.

Since it's been 42 years since I last saw the film, it was fun to hear Phil Harris and Scatman Crothers again (And hear Nancy Kulp - as a horse - sing too!).

Aristocats fans will want this new release - and it should introduce this overlooked Disney feature - the 20th for the studio - to a new generation.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I loved it. I loved each of the cats individually, and dear Madame, and even silly Georges, the lawyer. Of course I hated Edgar the evil butler and was amused by the two hound-dogs. But what I confess I loved the most was the Scat Cat's jazz band and that wonderful song, ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat."" We cat lovers know just how true that is, don't we?

Duchess and her three lovable kittens, Marie, Berlois and Toulouse, live with dear Madame, a wealthy and lonely old lady. She calls her old friend and lawyer, Georges, to come and write up her will. But the sneaky butler Edgar is listening on the speaking tube and overhears that she plans to leave all her money to the cats, with Edgar to take care of them. Edgar will then get the residue of the estate when all the cats are gone. But he doesn't want to wait, so he decides to get rid of Duchess and the kittens. He dumps them out in the country, figuring he's well rid of them. But he had not counted on Thomas O'Malley the alley cat, who happens by and rescues them.

The story is of course much more complex, incredibly funny, and as I say, includes the perfectly wonderful Alley Cat Jazz Band. And this being Disney, of course it all ends well for the cats and Madame -- and even for Georges.",1336953600,,1441,4.2327272727272724

The film is set in 1910 Paris, France and centers on a mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens: Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse. Their owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is making out her will and her butler (Edgar) overhears the will and realizes that he is second in line to Madame fortunes with the cat and kittens being first. Edgar kidnaps the feline family and fails in his attempt to kill them, but does manage to loose the family. The family is found by a cat named Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley the Alley Cat. Thomas O'Malley agrees to help find their way back home. On the way back home O'Malley meets up with Scat Cat and his musical cat gang. All the cats sing to Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat. O'Malley brings home the family safely, but Edgar there is waiting to kidnap the cat and kittens and send them to Timbuktu. Roquefort, a mouse, alerts O'Malley about what is going on and O'Malley rushes back to save Duchess and the kittens and Scat Cat and his gang also come to help save the day as well.

This would be the last movie for two actors: Maurice Chevalier who was coax out of retirement to sing the opening theme song as well as poking fun at him at the end of the film. Look for the scene where Roquefort is chasing Scat Cat and his gang. The other actor final performance is Bill Thompson who played Uncle Waldo the English goose. Overall the Aristocats is a good movie to watch along with some funny scene to go with it. The Aristocats gets an AAAA++++.

765900,5,6303984088,"I don't review movies very often.  Very, very rarely do I even watch a movie.  But I remember watching this movie when all my kids were little (we had rented it from a movie rental place).  I remembered that it was good, so I therefore recently bought it from Amazon, and just now got around to watching it.  I wanted to watch it with my little granddaughter (even though she's not old enough to care about it yet) and with my kids again, even though they are older.

It is a cute little family cartoon movie.  It is the perfect movie to watch with your family.  It is only (I think) about an hour and fifteen minutes.  That is good for me, because I have a HARD time sitting through a movie.  Even this movie, as good as it was, and as short as it was, was hard for me to sit through.  I don't usually pick up on plots.  (I'd much rather be reading a book.)

Anyway, this is a cute little cat movie.  I enjoyed it (even though it was hard for me to sit through.)  My little granddaughter was there.  When she gets older, if she likes movies, she can watch it again.  This movie was my movie quota for the next 5 or 10 years.  I probably won't watch another movie for at least another 10 years - or maybe never.  I am now going to my books.  If I don't get back to reading, I will go crazy . . .",1276560000,2,1295,3.98828125

We are all having a grand time watching it over and over.  Hopefully for now the girls will be happy with their movie and get their alive kitty in a few more years.,1274227200,,468,4.2727272727272725

But  I  remember  seeing  this  when  it  was  aired  on  a  Toledo  station  in  Toledo  Ohio. To  be  honest  here. This  happends  to  be  the  funnest  disney  movie  I  have  ever  seen. Infect  this  is  the  oney  Disney  movie  I  would  watch  over  and  over  again. What  else  is  there  to  love  in  a  movie. Great  music,  great  lines,  and  great  voices  of  chators  done  by  the  best  actors  and  actresses. So  who  did  the  voices  in  this  movie? Phil  Harris  who  did  the  voice  of  Thomas  O  Malley,  also  did  the  voice  of  Baloo  the  bear  in  The  Jungle  Book  and  Big  John  in  Robin  Hood. Stering  Halloway  who  did  the  voice  of  Roquefort  the  mouse  also  did  the  voice  of  Winning  the  Poo  in  those  Winning  the  Poo  movies. And  the  guy  who  does  the  voice  of  Scat  Cat, Doesent  it  sound  like  voice  of  that  guy  who  played  Turkle  the  night  guard  in  One  Flew  over  the  Cookoo  Nest  and  Dick  Hallorann  in  The  Shinning,  and  Chico  and  the  man. Its  great  famly  entertainment  with  no  vilonts. The  Butler  guy  sure  gives  me  the  the  creeps  in  a  funny  way. Now  why  isn't  that  guy  working  for  The  Adam  Family? But  I  do  love  the  ending  when  Roquefort  tell  the  horse  The  End  and  horse  says  I'am  the  leader  and  I  will  tell  you  when  it  The  End, The  word  The  End  appears  on  the  screen  and  the  horse  says  The  End",1254009600,,1850,4.100977198697068

All the animal characters are great enrichment to this classic film.,1243987200,,347,4.1940298507462686
766037,4,6303984088,"It's all about the voices... and something of the animation, in this gentle story of a much-loved mother cat and her three charming kittens in 1910 Paris. Pampered by their elderly mistress who intends to leave her entire estate to them, they find themselves drugged and abandoned in the countryside by Edgar the wicked butler - who wants the whole estate for himself. But since this is a Disney movie, the perils are well - not very perilous at all, as Duchess and her kittens are taken in hand by the roguishly handsome and good-guy-in--spite-of-himself Thomas O'Malley, the Alley Cat. Only a little diverted along the way by a pair of wandering British geese, and a rollicking good time with a swinging alley-cat band, the `aristocats' return home... but Edgar the wicked butler is still there. Thanks to their mouse friend, Roquefort and O'Malley's alley cat friends - and the last-minute aid of a horse with a very neat sense of timing (not to mention good aim!) Edgar is banished, and it all ends on as happy a note  as Disney movies ever did.

Released in 1970 it marks the end of an era, being the very last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney. It was also Maurice Chevalier's very last vocal performance, according to an interview feature with the Sherman brothers, included among the extras. All things considered, it has worn very well. It is one of those small mysteries though - how Eva Gabor could be such a mediocre actress in live action, but do such touching and personable voice work as Duchess. The characters of the country dogs, Lafayette and Napoleon (voiced by Pat Buttram and George Lindsey) and their complicated pursuit of Edgar and his motor-bike sidecar was also unexpectedly diverting and hilarious. But what was a pair of southern good old boy hound-dogs doing in 1910 France? Probably the same thing that a mid-20th century feline jazz band was doing; this is a Disney movie, after all.

Extras include interviews with the Sherman brothers about the music, and a restored sequence of a song that was not used in the final cut. For my money, the best extras were a very witty and artistically accomplished excerpt from Disney's ""The Great Cat Family"" and an entire short Minnie Mouse and Figaro featurette ""Bath Day.""",1243900800,,2256,4.809278350515464

766041,3,6303984088,"Why do some rich, childless women leave their entire fortunes to pets--cats, in particular?  The question can addle one's mind, even driving some to kidnapping and attempted murder.  It completely freaked out Edgar, the much maligned butler in ""The Aristocats,"" Disney's tribute not to cats, or the upper class--but to the jazz age.

Edgar learns of his status in his boss's will by listening to a conversation through--what else?--a drain pipe in his tiny quarters.  So that night he drugs the woman's four cats (Eva Gabor, really, and three illegitimate kittens) and drops them off in the country.  There's no way they can find their way back, unless they meet Ballou the Bear or some other Phil Harris-esque figure--which, fortunately, they do.  Harris is just as cool and charming as ever as the free-spirited Thomas O'Malley Cat.  But instead of entering with the more charming, ""Well it's a doobity doo, it's a doobity doo, I mean a dooby dooby dooby dooby doobity do,"" Ballou--I mean, O'Malley--sings a long, tiresome tribute to his lack of responsibility.

To his credit, he almost immediately feels responsible for the stranded cat family in spite of their apparent lack of shortcomings, hijacking a milk truck headed for Paris and the aristocratic mansion where the woman is by now completely losing it.  (Perhaps she should have made more effort to bond with humans, rather than pets.  I'm not saying she deserved this, but people do set themselves up for tragedy, and then act completely shocked when the inevitable happens.)  Later, they meet up with two spinster geese and their alcoholic uncle.  Edgar, meanwhile, tries to retrieve his hat from two American Civil War throwback dogs that have somehow ended up in the French countryside.

It's all just a prelude to the rocking finale, set in a flophouse full of O'Malley's ner-do-well friends, who live for jazz and just hanging out, Daddio.  They're so laid back, so tolerant of different lifestyles--or so one might think, until the puzzling refrain of their catchy song: ""A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born every time he plays/With a square in the act, you can send music back to the caveman days."" They go on to decree that only a select few--hepcats, specifically--should be allowed to play music at all.  As if to hammer home the point, the ""cats"" launch into an inspired, raucous rocking jazz tirade that threatens to literally bring down the flophouse.

It's the defining scene of the movie, really the only one worth waiting for, and it comes to a screeching halt when an emaciated, buck toothed, Asian-looking ""cat"" plays a piano solo with chopsticks and blurts:  ""Shanghai Hong Kong egg foo yung/Fortune cookie always wrong.""  What?  Should we let our kids watch this movie?  Well, it's hard to refuse them when you see them dancing through the house, singing, ""Everybody/everybody/everybody wants to be a cat.""  Unfortunately, this movie is likely to make a parent identify more with the butler than with the hepcats.",1230854400,,3012,4.972055888223553

I was concerned when I went to the store to pick up this DVD and saw that it was  a 1-disc ""Special"" Edition. It was always announced as a 2-disc Special Edition DVD. We saw it in sneak peeks in various Disney DVDs as in the DVD booklets. I loved how the ""First Time Ever on 2-disc DVD"" phrase was put so big in them.

Being a Disney fan it is hard not to.  But, it is NOT among  their best in my opinion.  Remember, the 1st complete animated release after Walt's passing in December 1966.  He had worked on the MUCH better The Jungle Book.

When I saw there was going to be this special edition I normally really love Disney's special edition or Platinum DVD releases.

Man, what a disappointment.  For the price.

Only a 1 disc package.  WHERE IS THE 2CD DISC WITH SOME GOOD EXTRAS?

There is no 'Making of"" or ""Behind the Scenes"" on  the film.  I normally really enjoy watching these.

The colors and crispness of image on this DVD are truly amazing.  I would love to see this movie on Blu-Ray. It is hard to imagine this film looked much better in the theater.  The story is the tried and true Disney formula of separation and struggle to be reunited.  Innocent enough for the youngest kids, this movie has plenty to offer their parents.  It is a shame there aren't six stars for a film like this.  The DVD also lets you isolate the songs and skip everything else.  It's like buying a separate soundtrack disc but with full animation.

The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the Disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number ""The Aristocats"" as well as ""Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat"", this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.",1203292800,,800,4.640845070422535
766210,3,6303984088,"The late 1960s and all of the 1970s were not a great time for Walt Disney Pictures.  This film was made after Walt's death and it shows.  Without his direction, the studio produced some real flops, and this film is one of them.

The Aristocats suffers from the same ailments a lot of Disney films of this era suffered--a painfully slow pace and an aimless, meandering story.  The Jungle Book and Robin Hood both had these issues to varying degrees.  Like both of those films, this one does have some charm and a nice musical soundtrack.  It is also very, very dated.  That might make it a fun nostalgia trip for adults but expect this movie to be sort of boring for children.

If you know that you or your children do like this film, this release is a nice one.  Get it.  If you just want to get a movie for your kids that will be tolerable for you to watch, know that this is not your best choice (try Bambi, Lady and the Tramp or Dumbo instead).",1202947200,,947,4.240223463687151
766211,4,6303984088,"While The Aristocats is definitely not even probably a top 10 favorite Disney animated film of mine, it IS one that's brought me a lot of enjoyment. Enough so that I was willing to pay the $[...] and buy this new DVD edition, even though I had the previous Gold Classic Collection edition.

You don't even need to watch both - just look at their lists of bonus material offerings - to see that this new DVD blows the previous one away, although there is a reason some may disagree. More on that later. While the previous one had a very easy trivia game and a 1980's reissue trailer, which is sadly not found on the new disc, this one does include some nice, if often fluffy, bonus material, which includes set-top and DVD-ROM versions of a Virtual Kitten game, deleted song, a look at the music, a nice photo gallery, and an excerpt from The Wonderful World Of Disney titled The Great Cat Family. The final bonus, which was never really mentioned in any press-release and definitely not on the package, is a delightful Disney animated short titled Bath Day, which starred Figaro the kitten from Pinocchio.

The new digital transfer blows the previous one out of the water in nearly every way. Much of the softness is gone, the color is superior, and it's not as fuzzy and grainy as it was previously. It's also presented for the first time ever on video in widescreen, although this is a point of contention for some. Most Disney animated films from the 1960's and 1970's were designed with both widescreen theater screens and square TV sets in mind, and therefore were animated in the 1.33:1 Academy ratio but designed so that you didn't lose much character information when the film was matted for widescreen theatrical release. In the case of the new rash of reissues of these movies in cropped widescreen, I don't see an issue with it, as they had intended either presentation. And unlike the cropped widescreen presentation on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jungle-Book/dp/B000OLGCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jungle Book</a>, which seemed a bit cramped more often than I'd have liked, this one, as well as the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Most-Wanted-Edition/dp/B000ICM5T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood: Most Wanted Edition</a>, looks more comfortable in the cropped aspect ratio. However, if you have the Gold Classic Collection release, I still suggest you own this new one and marvel at the new presentation, while keeping the previous release so that you can also have the full image available.

Despite the obvious upgrade, this DVD is another sad example of Disney's newfound laziness with their DVDs, much of which has to do with Blu-Ray, but that's another rant for another time. Instead of making a 2-Disc set, especially as this was first advertised as one back in 2006, they did one of their typical 1-disc ""not THAT much of an upgrade"" reissues of their Gold Classic Collection editions for this release, without retaining anything from the previous release. Disney could have easily filled up a 2-Disc set with one disc for the family audience, which contained the original 1.33:1 version of the film and all the kid-friendly features, while they include another disc for the enthusiast audience with the widescreen version and more fan-oriented bonus materials, like a making-of featurette, even if it's just some TV crap or a 15-minute long piece they threw together. Plus some TRAILERS. The sad fact is, as far as I know, it's been 2005 since Disney last released a non-Platinum and non-Pirates 2-Disc DVD, especially for their classic films, and it'd honestly be nice if Disney would put some of the same energy they had making their DVD releases back in the early 2000's into the DVDs they make today. As a fan, I'm tired of Disney catering almost exclusively to the under-12 market and not enough to the adult fans like myself. Disney animated films may have a sizeable pre-teen audience, but they also have a sizeable adult audience who also wants to enjoy the DVD experience.

Despite my rant above, I'm still happy to own this new Aristocats DVD. With improved picture quality and a handful of decent bonus materials, it's worth a look. Four stars.",1202860800,6,4298,5.118233618233618
766212,3,6303984088,"There are over a hundred reviews for The Aristocats as of this date. They all refer to the previous edition (Disney Gold Classic Edition or whatever they called it years ago when it first came out on dvd).
So now we will have those reviews mixed up with new reviews for the Feb 5, 2008 version which offers more extras and a different aspect ratio. This may make things a bit confusing.

Moving on...
People compare this film to 101 Dalmations. This is Disney's ""cat"" movie, they say. You can't compare them; they're too similiar somehow.
But they are both decent, cute family films.
Yes, Cruella is scary compared to the bumbling butler Edgar. There is a sense of jeopardy but Dalmations is much stronger in that sense.
Both films were made using the 1960's Xerox method where the resulting animation is more sketchy looking and more close to the original animator's drawings.
The Aristocats is more of a musical, definitely. A few forgettable songs, but also the charming and infectious tune ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"". That is the tune I think of when I remember the adventures of Duchess and Thomas and the kittens. (101 Dalmations had the little ""Cruella De Vil"" song, but that's it.)

Overall this is a fun vehicle but it is not a classic such as Peter Pan, Cinderella, or Lady and the Tramp. It has a nice, relaxing pace and is probably most appealing to youngsters. The voice talent, as ever with Disney cartoon features, is great. Eva Gabor's Duchess is warm and maternal while Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley is macho yet sweet (and sounds like a lifelong diehard smoker). He also lent his vocal prowess to The Jungle Book when he played Baloo the bear.

This special edition for 2008 has some cute extras. But unless you're a total stickler for aspect ratios or you collect every version they release, the previous edition should suffice. It was fine, with a clear and bright picture/sound presentation.",1202342400,99,1916,4.713432835820895
766213,5,6303984088,"Shame on Amazon for recycling reviews without adding a disclaimer.  The reviews complaining about full screen do not apply to the 2008 release.  This release is ""enhanced"" for 16x9.  It is widescreen but not a true  Theatrical Ratio.

I enjoyed it when I first saw it in theater and feel it's one of the underated Disney classics.",1202342400,14,330,4.719298245614035
766214,4,6303984088,"Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley) is a wealthy former actress living in Paris in 1910.  Since she has no family, she has come to view her cat Dutchess (Eva Gabor) and her kittens as her family.  In fact, she has decided to leave her wealth to the cats as long as they live, then it will go to her butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby).

Edgar doesn't like the idea of having to wait, however, so he schemes to catnap the cats.  After mixing sleeping pills into their favorite treat, he takes them into the country.

The cats aren't so easily gotten rid of, however.  Teaming up with Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), they set out to return to Paris.  Will they make it?  What will Edgar do if they show up again?

This movie leans just slightly over average.  There are parts of the story that are rather dull, like the introduction of the twin ducks.  However, there are some wonderful bits as well, like the two country dogs to keep attacking Edgar.  This will appeal to kids more then adults, and they will love it.  While not all the songs are jazz, it certainly influenced the soundtrack.  And you've got to love ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat,"" the show stopping number that comes near the end.  The animation is more stylized then we've seen before, with flat backgrounds and pencil like lines in the characters.  It's definitely dated, but has a charm all its own.

This movie just got a new Special Edition.  The widescreen picture and full surround are wonderful.  The special they are most proud of is the ""virtual kitten"" game.  I skipped right past that and went straight to the features about the movie.  The one I really enjoyed was the information about ""She Never Felt Alone,"" a song deleted from the movie.  I was hoping the featurette on the Sherman Brothers would be more about their entire career at Disney, but there are some fun tidbits about their work on this film.  And keep your eyes open for a bonus short that plenty of fun.

On the whole, this is a light film with some fun moments.  It's probably not one the adults will pull out regularly, but it should keep the kids entertained with the funny action scenes.",1202256000,12,2144,4.535248041775457

Unfortunately the cats did not get the Platinum Edition treatment all the more popular classics have been getting. The picture is grainy and sometimes oddly sketchy. There's no second disk of delicious extras to pour through either, just the bear minimum.",1202256000,2,503,4.781609195402299
766330,4,6303984088,"Last night I printed up some frame grabs of the new letterboxed Aristocats DVD and compared them to my full frame Laserdisc.

The new DVD adds more picture to the sides, mostly the right side in the shots I compared, but it does crop off some picture from the top & more from the bottom.

Neither ratio shows the entire picture as it was filmed.  Both ratios are acceptable.  HDTV owners will prefer the letterboxed version, square TV owners may prefer the full frame version as these will fill their screens.

As for the movie, it falls short of being a classic. The story drags at times and the xerography animation gives the film a 'pencil test' look.  Well, that is because Xerox had developed a process to transfer the pencil tests
to animation cells, removing a step in the animation process.  I don't dislike this style, it is a style unto its own, this is just not 101 Dalmations or Jungle Book (which also used this style of animation).",1202169600,7,945,4.523529411764706

766332,4,6303984088,"i don't think I've seen this movie since it was first released in 1970. It has the distinction of being the last animated movie put into production by Walt Disney himself, a few years before he passed away. There are no nail-biting sequences nor extraordinarily evil villains...this is a sweet sweet film with a somewhat predictable plot that is definitely endearing and full of memorable songs. Maurice Chevalier was coaxed out of retirement by the Sherman Brothers (they tell the details in one of the extra segments) to sing the title song and none other than Louis Armstrong sings the wonderful fast-paced song, ""Everybody Wants to Be A Cat."" Phil Harris lends his voice to the lead male role of O'Malley the Alley cat (and duets with Louis on the previously mentioned song). Eva Gabor plays the female lead, Duchess, the mother of three kittens and apple of her wealthy mistress' eye, Adelaide (the voice of Hermoine Baddeley). I can't say enough about Gabor; she has a subtlety of emotion, charm, and humanity that shines through her wonderful accent. Briefly, the story is of Duchess and her three kittens who live in pampered Parisian luxury with Adelaide until the greedy butler, Edgar, decides to kidnap the cats so that he can inherit all of Adelaide's wealth instead of the cats. Dumped far away in the country, it takes O'Malley the Alley Cat to help get them back to Adelaide's, but not without a few fun journeys along the way. Sterling Holloway is wonderful as the cat's unlikely pal and hero, Roquefort. The animation has a similar rough-sketch look to it that Dalmations did. The picture quality is exceptional, as is the sound. As for the extras, they are a nice bunch considering this is only a one-disc set. The usual gallery of concept art, sketches, publicity materials, etc. The  Virtual Kitten game is somewhat amusing, but probably more so for a very young child (you have to click the correct button to choose or anticipate what your kitty will do next). ""Fun with Language"" teaches children how to identify musical instruments. ""Bath Day"" (6:38) is a cute Minnie Mouse cartoon with Figaro the cat. I really enjoyed the excerpt from a 1956 Wonderful World of Disney show (hosted by Walt himself) entitled ""The Great Cat Family"" (12:50) with a fun history of the cat, accompanied by some wonderful animation. Richard Sherman introduces a deleted song, accompanied by storyboard sketches and production drawings, using the original demo audio recordings. We learn here that Eva's singing voice was expertly dubbed by Robie Lester. ""The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs"" (4:33) has both of the Sherman brothers (but mainly Richard) talking about how they created the memorable musical numbers for this animated feature. What's missing? Sure would have been nice to have an overall ""Making Of"" featurette, but still this is a solid release and an enjoyable movie.",1201564800,4,2902,4.958932238193018

766469,5,6303984088,"Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from ""Alice In Wonderland"" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse.

Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed Duchess and the street born O'Malley.",1158969600,,1829,4.733542319749216

Anyway, I have one named Abner that looks just like the dark gray kitten in the movie. This film is about cats and there are several adorable scenes. I especially love the scenes at the beginning when the cats are at home painting and singing and playing the piano. They're so adorable! It doesn't matter that they're animated.

Their owner is making out her will and her butler Edgar overhears that he will be her beneficiary only AFTER her cats are dead. After some math, he realizes he'll be dead before he gets a cent, so he decides to dispose of the kitties by dropping them off someplace far from home. If he had been smart, he would have waited for the Missus to die then just spend the cats' money considering he would likely be the one responsible for the cats anyway. But why should I let something like logic get in the way of movie storytelling? Anyway, I refuse to see Edgar as the bad guy. I would be ticked too if I had to defer to animals.

Unfortunately, the scenes after this development are not as good. Don't tell me that because it's a cartoon I should see no flaws in it. We get treated to scenes of two annoying dogs and two annoying geese (I can't believe I can't tell a goose from a swan). The story is thin, and O'Malley the alley cat is not interesting in the least. The best thing about the movie are the three kittens. And of course, the song: ""Ev'rybody, ev'rybody, ev'rybody wants to be a cat!""",1156464000,2,1525,4.291666666666667

766542,5,6303984088,"Disney's ""The Aristocats"" is probably one of the most underrated among all of them, in fact, every single Disney animated film to be released in the 1970's is remember to be cheap and bland, however, of the three main ones to be released, probably Robin Hood (1973) is the only one to be somewhat weaker.  I think people and critics just have it against ""The Aristocats"" and ""The Rescuers,"" not because they were bad, because they are certainly not, but because they came after Walt's death and they believed that nothing could ever stand up to his quality, although it must be stated, that the quality of his own films in the 1960's was very low.  Starting with weak and bland tales as ""101 Dalmatians,"" The Sword in the Stone"" and ""The Jungle Book"" were far less interesting than ""The Aristocats,"" ""The Rescuers,"" or even those from the so called ""dark age,"" titles such as ""The Fox and the Hound"" and ""The Black Cauldron.""

""The Aristocats"" is the story of a family of cats, Dutchess and kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse, destined to inherit the fortune of Madame Adelaide Bonfamille.  The old woman foreshadows her passing and decides it is time to prepare her will so that her beloved cats will be taken care of.  However, when Edgar, the greedy butler overhears the conversation between Madame and her faithful lawyer, Edgar decides to do the impossible to be the one to inherit the first term, for this he decides to catnap the 4 kittens and send them far away so that they'll never be heard from again.  His plan works and the kittens are sent away, still alive and missing their kind mistress, the four embark on a journey through the wild countryside of France, back to their home in Paris.

The story is classic Disney, and the film may be accused of being very similar to ""101 Dalmatians,"" however, this one is indeed 101 times better.  The Aristocats is more artistic, more colorful and with more memorable characters like the good Thomas O'Malley Cat and his band of jazz-playing felines.  The Aristocats is somewhat more of an interesting story, it doesn't revolve only on the characters running back and forth with the villain after them, but it involves fun scenes with Edgar making sure his plan works and he seems to think a bit better than Cruella DeVil, although not making such an impact as the famous villainess.

The Aristocats is superiour to 101 Dalmatians, yet this film is treated as if it was the worst Disney had ever released, when they themselves know that not even them can pull such quality today.  Films like ""The Aristocats"" aren't being made anymore, good, clean comedy is over.  Very sad for Disney.  ""The Aristocats"" is highly recommended, however, the DVD is a bit poor.",1119571200,2,2713,4.710359408033827

Madame, with the help of O'Malley the alley cat, a couple of geese, and Scat Cat and his gang, must now find their way back home to their mistress.

The song numbers are wonderfully catchy, and the characters are loveable.

766702,3,6303984088,"The Aristocats is good enough for the kids, but the adults are likely to tire of it quickly.  There is nothing wrong with this movie.  The animation is perfectly fine, in that it is a completely different species of art from the modern computer graphic.  The story is typical fare for children (cats get stolen and lost, have an adventure to find their way home, and live happily ever after), a sort of morph between ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmations"".  There is one tune that is pretty decent, though doesn't quite deliver on the wonderful high-energy jazziness like ""The Jungle Book"".  All in all, this is a movie that the children aren't likely to tire of soon.
That being said, it just seems to lack the flair (musically and literarily) of other Disney classics, such as ""The Jungle Book"", ""Lady and the Tramp"" and, ""Mary Poppins"".  Musically this movie is very weak.  There is one tune that is almost quite good, but not quite.  For story, the adult just feels a lot like they have seen this movie before.  There is nothing magical or surprising.  It's just sort of predictable and flat, not even particularly funny.
Overall, if you are just looking for a movie to occupy the kids for a little while, this might be a good selection.  Small children, at least, will like this for quite a while.  If you are looking for a movie to be a family affair that will actually be enjoyed by everyone, you might want to pass on this one look elsewhere - because the ""grown folks"" are going to get sick of this one quickly, perhaps even before the end of the first viewing.",1084233600,3,1573,4.5

It was created back when Disney movies were made for the sake of being made.  It wasn't made to gross millions of dollars in profit.  It wasn't a vehicle for a new Disney Channel series.  It didn't try to teach you some great moral lesson.  It was simply made to entertain, and that is what it does.
Younger children will definitely love this film.  The songs are fun to sing and there is enough silly action to hold any two-year old's attention.  Adults, especially between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, may grow a little tired of this movie because they may not be used to a film that isn't tied in with some type of toy line or ride at Disneyworld.  Older adults will probably like it for the simple fact that it provides nostalgia.

Madame knows that she is getting older, so she puts together her will, leaving her estate to her beloved cats and nothing for her devoted butler, Edgar (voice by Roddy Maude-Roxby).  Horrified that his years of service earned him nothing and outraged that Madame would choose to leave her fortune to her cats instead of himself, Edgar drugs the cats and leaves them in the countryside.  Duchess is not sure what to do or how to survive in the country, but she soon finds a gallant rescuer in the form of O'Malley the alley cat (voice by Phil Harris).  O'Malley was initially attracted to Duchess because she was beautiful, but, as they continue their travels and he comes to get to know her and her children, he starts thinking of settling down and leaving his footloose and fancy free life behind.  However, the cats still do not know that Edgar was the one who tried to get rid of them, so even when they do make it back to Madame's mansion, they still are not safe...
The Aristocats is a charming Disney film with that classic, old time animation style that Walt Disney became known for.  All of the fun Disney characters are found here, including charming (and scene stealing) supporting characters.  My absolute favorites are Napoleon and Lafeyette (voice by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay), who were hysterical as country dogs who chased Edgar.  Roquefort the Mouse (voice by Sterling Holloway) was also charming as a little Sherlock Holmes who solved the mystery and foiled the villainous plot.  There is not as much singing in this film as in other Disney cartoons, but what there is is a fun introduction to jazz for younger viewers.

They have a long journey back, they almost get run over by a train, O'malley goes down a river and gets ""smimming lessons,"" Dutchess meets with twin geese, and they play instruments with Scat Cat and his gang (which are O'malleys' old friends).
When the cats finally go home, O'malley leaves, as he doesn't belong there. Edgar is angry and wants to send the cats to Timbuktu. O'malley helps them once he can get Scat Cat and his gang to help. When they get Edgar slammed into the package, they send HIM to Timbuktu.

Otherwise, stick with Bambi or The Lion King if you want a great Disney critter movie.",1038096000,7,773,4.4714285714285715

I find it a pity that you can only choose between the English and a French audio track, I would have enjoyed a bigger variety of versions, but be it as it is. The trivia game is cute, my 5-year old daughter could answer almost all questions and was very thrilled. And I liked the story book read-along with options for smaller or bigger children to have it read to them or read themselves. All in all a great DVD for the whole family and I can only recommend it to all Disney fans!",1031788800,4,562,3.93859649122807
766974,4,6303984088,"Until recently I had never seen THE ARISTOCATS. Even though the movie is a good movie for families, I have to admit that I wasn't really missing much. The movie is a classical Walt Disney (the man) film. The animation isn't much to look at nowadays, but when the film came out it was top notch. The story is rather simple and the film really doesn't have that memorable music. If you're a cat lover, you will probably love the movie. However, I'm a dog person and was really hoping Edgar would get away with his crime. I mean if I spent my entire life working as a Butler for a rich old lady and was promised to inherit some of her wealth only to find that I wouldn't get anything until the cats were dead, I would be pretty upset, too. A fun, but tame, film.",1022112000,,759,4.170068027210885
766975,5,6303984088,"Watching this film now,(as I do, often) I'm struck by how dated it seems now. At the time, the music and animation were considered cutting-edge, now it seems slightly archaic and old, which isn't to say it's a bad film, far, far from it. It's just that times and styles have changed so radically from when this film was made.
The main feline charactors, Duchess and her three kittens, are irrepressible, and Thomas the wise-cracking alley cat, is a hoot. In the middle of the scheme to heist the cats, two old dogs are introduced who may be the funniest parts of the entire film, Napolean and LaFayette. Too funny for words!
This film is really wonderful, and it came as something of a surprise to me, as I hadn't seen it before I got it when released on video. Now, I can't say how many times I've watched it. It's just a sweet, very enjoyable romp that can enjoyed by the entire family.",1017100800,,888,4.420731707317073
766976,4,6303984088,"First, it's just cool they used cats as the animal in this film.  what other animal would be able to play jazz in such a swingin' way.  but seriously, did you notice how every cat was of a different heritage? Dutchess and the kittens, French, O'Maley (Irish) ... who had an incredibly long name (Abraham D'Lacy Geocept Percacey Thomas O'Maley, O'Maley the Alley Cat), which Dutchess noted ""covered all of Europe.""  When we're introduced to his friends, we have a Fats Domino type chubby gray trumpet playin' ""Scat Cat.""  The bass player's from Eastern Europe, Russia perhaps or in the 70s would have been USSR?  The hippy guitar playing cat with big glasses and beads, the possibly Swiss cat on accordian.  They're all ""cats"" but of different places, all jamming and all linked to O'Maley enjoying life together.  As this movie was comin' out of the late 60s, Disney's showing America that anyone, from where ever they're from or however they talk, can all be friends and hang out.  Unfortunately, they give the British a hard time, with the fun loving gabbin' geese who inform the audience that in being british, they aim to ""keep things proper.""  The butler, too, was British, I believe.  Poor guys.  Not only that love everyone and have a ball attitude comes off the screen, but the movie also encourages practicing and teaching the arts-painting, piano, singing (even with the proper syllables!  (""do me sol do re fa la it goes.... when you play your scales and your arpeggios...."") what a cartoon!",1013904000,2,1502,4.801556420233463
766977,5,6303984088,"""The Aristocats"" is a great, simple film that continued on Disney's animation department after Walt's death. Disney himself gave the go ahead for this film, but unfortunately he never got to work on it. There was a point in time, where there was a possibility that Disney Animation studios was going to close down since Walt was no longer there. Luckily for us, Roy Disney Sr. never pulled the plug, the film was made, and Walt Disney Studios continued on.
As stated in passed reviews, the animation is sort of iffy at times becuase of the new techniques that were being used in the beginning of the 70's, but the Disney basics are still there. Many people claim that this film began the decline of Disney films until ""The Little Mermaid"" appeared 19 years later. This all depends on how you look at it. Yes, the 70's and 80's (up to '88), didn't see anything that seemed to resemble Walt Disney's touch, but all of the films that were made during this time also appealed many and are underappreciated simply becuase they were post-Jungle Book but Pre-Little Mermaid.
My personal opinion, is that the Disney magic continued in the 70's and 80's, but in a different way. Unfortunatly, since everyone was just accustomed to Walt Disney's personal style, people were just not ready for the change.
After taking all of this into consideration, I watched the film for the first time on DVD, and the bottom line is, that it's a terrific Disney film.",1005436800,5,1443,4.68503937007874

The bright animation and colorful characters keep the story swinging and full of life. Differences are set aside to help each other. Our kids danced and sang at the end with comments such as: ""I love this movie!"" ""I love cats!"" ""I want to be a cat!"" They completely identified with the characters and teamwork and noted: ""It teaches you how to be good to people."" ""The dogs teased each other like I do my friends. They were just having fun.""

The ""villain"" in this movie - a greedy but likable butler - is baffoonish and not prone to causing nightmares.  All the music is fun and upbeat. Lots of sassy talking animals.

766982,4,6303984088,"I first saw this movie when it was first released in 1970 when I was 9.  I loved it as did my little sister and parents.  I liked the little mouse Rochfert the best.  And it made me sad many years later when I took my grandmother to see this movie on a re-release to the theaters and saw it horribly edited and Rochfert's role almost nonexistant.  Even today when I bought the vhs of The Aristocats, his role was smaller than it was in 1970.  He was the narrator and made it a point to let us know of his fondness for the stories of Sherlock Holmes.  I do hope that some time in the future this movie can be restored to its original beauty.
Still the movie is fun and the music is wonderful.  Phil Harris and Eva Gabor were great in their respective roles and the kittens made me laugh. Another enjoyable moment happens when O'Mally introduces Duchess and her kittens to his music making pals and a night of music and dance occurs.
One point should be made to other people who missed it, there was some violence in this movie, though small in content it is still there.  It occurs in the climax when the butler tries to get Duchess and her children for the last time and ends up being  done in by all the animals.
This a Disney keeper and should be part of anyone's video library, even in its edited form.",984441600,5,1305,4.208835341365462

She is sensitive to angry voices and loud noises so it was difficult to find a movie or cartoon that she could enjoy without having to skip the violent or noisy scenes.
Aristocats is such a perfect little show for her to watch over and over, she now knows all of the songs, imitates the kittens and runs through the house calling ""Duchess, kittens, where are you??""
If you want your child to enjoy Disney classics without the witches and mean-spirited people, or worse, the later movies with violence and loud, angry voices throughout, this is the best chance you have to show your child the lighter, gentler side of Disney.",979862400,38,751,4.646616541353383

767167,4,6303984088,"Considering Disney's recent track record, it would appear that they think the average kid is maturing faster than before. Thus, they seem to put out movies that are dark and inappropriate for the average kid. The only  exceptions to this trend are the wonderful Toy Story movies and A Bug's  Life. Flash back a decade or two, and you'll find a different Disney, a  Disney that made movies everybody could enjoy. Aristocats comes from that  era. True the animation from this decade is weak, and the story loses a few  points in some areas. The villain is also quite tame. All of that, however,  disappears under the movie's charm, upbeat attitude, and general fun. It's  certainly more fun than Hercules. People looking for something intense  should avoid this. Families with small children and those who love adorable  cats will love this movie. From this era, I also recommend Robin Hood.
