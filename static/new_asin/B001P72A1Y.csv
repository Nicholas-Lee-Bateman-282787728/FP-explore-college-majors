This old melodrama with Montiel and Raf Vallone is part of movie history in the Spanish-speaking world, having been seen by millions since its release in 1958. A truly unforgettable experience if you enjoy the genre.",1421452800,,351,4.770491803278689

8332248,5,B001P72A1Y,"LA VIOLETERA is a film to be experienced with one's heart and mind very open to the traditions of popular melodrama, a genre that stayed in fashion for several decades in Spanish and Latin American cinema. The film is a perfect example of the genre's ability to touch people's emotions to a very high degree, and does so with both technical and artistic overall quality.  At the center of this wonderful movie is Sara Montiel, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses of the Spanish-speaking world, a woman idolized by the crowds in a time characterized by mythical figures such as Dolores Del Rio, Maria Felix, Libertad Lamarque and Carmen Sevilla.
It is urgent that her best films (EL ULTIMO CUPLE, LA VIOLETERA, CARMEN LA DE RONDA, MI ULTIMO TANGO, PECADO DE AMOR) be issued in a box containing restored copies with English subtitles, as well as a profile of the actress done by a competent film historian.  It surprises me that Almodovar has not yet given himself such a task, as he is an admirer of the actress as an iconic presence in Spanish cultural life.",1324080000,2,1071,4.691489361702128
8332249,5,B001P72A1Y,"In spite of the lackluster DVD edition (no restoration, no remastering) ""La Violetera"" remains a charming film with enormous mass appeal. The movie starts working its magic on you from the first time you see street urchin Soledad (Sara Montiel) peddling violets on a cold New Year's Eve in 1899.  The period is very well recreated and the dialog has moments of outstanding wit.  The storyline is easy to follow with very accomplished moments of high romance, nostalgia and even suspense sprinkled here and there with some of the best songs written during la belle epoque.  For better or worse they don't make movies like this anymore, maybe because there are no stars like Sarita Montiel anymore.  Don't miss it!",1298851200,,712,4.908333333333333
8332250,5,B001P72A1Y,"The DVD is not transferred from a restored copy, so the color is overall faded, more importantly for a musical film, the sound synchronization is not good, sometimes Sara looks like she is dubbing herself, and the sound for the music numbers can be bad at times. Definitly deserves to be re-issued in a fully restored version this is a lavish Italo-Spanish production from 1958 that deserves the effort for preservation.

The movie was a tremendous success at the box office and it confirmed Sara Montiel's appeal as a star, which she had started one year previously with her first blockbuster, ""El Ultimo Cupl"" (1957). It is easy to see why. This woman was an absolute stage sensation and was additionally a good singer with lots of charisma. Here she is at her prime, in one outfit more outlandish than the last, but always gorgeous and glamorous.

The story is that of a poor violet seller (Very much like Liza in ""My Fair Lady"") who falls in love with a handsome aristocrat, Raf Vallone, that is on his way to yet one more night at the opera when she is selling flowers at the door of the theater. But neither his family or the social circles where he belongs are ready to accept her, though she is trying very hard to learn etiquette and manners. It is interesting to note that all the people who critizice her the most are either bitter, jealous and bitchy society women whose empty lives certainly need the fulfillment of judgement, or really hideous men who look like they could never have an illicit love affair no matter how much they would have wanted to. Although the action is set in the year 1900, the hypocritical and repressive society depicted is better understood within the context of contemporary Spain at that time, under the Franco dictatorship. She certainly looks stunning with the outfits and jewels he is lavishing on her, but when his brother is killed in a duel and he becomes the heir of the family's title, he feels obliged to leave her in a heart wrenching scene. What follows is a wonderful story with plenty of songs, of her career as a singer that eventually becomes an international sensation, a fateful trip to New York in the Titanic changes the course of her career, yet also provides the opportunity to reunite with her old time lover.

Sara Montiel was and continues to be a legend in her country of origin. Her cultural legacy as a public figure is interesting in and of itself. She has been an inspiration for Latinamerican and Spanish drag queens, a fact that is credited in Almodovar's recent movie, ""Bad Education"". Her sensuous singing and posturing was a challenge for Spanish society under Franco, which underwent a long, repressive period of political opression under his rule. Franco's Spain became obsessed by a cursi and ridiculous middle class morality that forbade divorce and was more interested in promoting a fanatical and retrograde return to ""Golden"" past of morality and religious devotion while obscuring and obstructing any authentic or worthwhile cultural developments that could challenge this Inquisitotrial perspective. Montiel's multiple marriages and well documented scandalous affairs were an oasis of freedom, as numerous attempts to hide the truth by the state-controlled media were consistently unsuccessful. In this respect she can be appreciated as beacon for the social changes that took over Spain like a tidal wave after the dictator's demise and have catapulted contemporary Spain as one of the most forward thinking and socially advanced societies in Europe.",1282089600,4,3537,4.921273031825796
8332251,4,B001P72A1Y,"Others have made some of these points, but they merit repeating:
This is a fascinating period piece too little known to English-speaking audiences and by now even to those comfortable with Spanish.  Two ""periods"" may interest new viewers: (a) the years around 1900 and (b) the 1950s when the film was made, with its romantic view of the ""belle poque.""  It is easy to deride that kind of sensibility, dismissing a film like this out of hand as corny.  Taken on its own terms it has a special sort of charm.  But the video and audio reproduction could definitely be a lot better.",1266364800,,577,4.572815533980583
8332252,4,B001P72A1Y,"First I must mention what makes this DVD release so special: it has English subtitles! For the first time ever, English-speaking people are able to watch this classic film and understand the basics of the plot and even the meaning of the songs.  However, it is tragic that the distributors DistriMax Inc. didn't make an effort to provide consumers with a digitally restored version of ""La Violetera.""  Consequently the copy we are getting here lacks the neatness and richness of color of the original production and, to make matters worse, the sound is uneven with a weird background noise popping up here and there. Maybe the ridiculous low price is intended to ""make up"" for the video and sound shortcomings. However it is time for video firms to realize that consumers would rather pay a little more and get quality specially in films like ""La Violetera"" a family classic for over 50 years.  Could we conceive at this point cheap lack luster DVD releases of films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Gone With The Wind""? Of course not! It would be disrespectful to both the film creators and to the consumers.  Well, the same good judgment should be applied to foreign classics.

Now that I've tackled the good, the bad and the ugly of this DVD I should mention something about the film itself, specially for those who have never seen it.  ""La Violetera"" is a 1958 Spanish-Italian co-production designed to showcase the beauty and talents of its star Sarita Montiel.  The previous year, Miss Montiel had surprised audiences in most of the civilized world with her performance in ""El Ultimo Cuple,""  a low budget musical drama which became the biggest box office success in the history of Spanish cinema.  After years of achieving lukewarm success as a leading lady of films made in Spain, Mexico and even Hollywood , Miss Montiel had finally hit the big time and proved that she could compete with the established  female superstars of the day Liz, Ava, Sophia, Gina and Brigitte. It was not only her remarkable good looks but rather the way she projected an ingenuity, a vulnerability laced with down to earth sexiness which connected with both male and female audiences in a magical mysterious way.  On top of all those attributes, Sarita could sing and could move people with her unique style in every song she sang no matter if a happy or sad tune.  Communication is too pale of a term to describe Sarita's effect on listeners.  She did not have a powerful voice like a Judy Garland but reminds more of a Billie Holiday a small sound with lots of feeling.

With ""El Ultimo Cuple"" she had proven her worth both as an actor and singer. Still some critics thought that it had all been a fluke and that Miss Montiel was just a temporary sensation that would eventually fade away, sort of a ""one hit wonder.""  Sarita had the last laugh when ""La Violetera"" came out and revalidated her appeal among the masses. It was an instant classic that on its first run became a certified blockbuster playing for over a year in Europe and Latin America.

The plot of ""La Violetera"" is a simple love story which was probably done before and has come back under many different guises in other films proving that ill-fated love affairs are always a crowd pleaser...
I wouldn't be surprised if director James Cameron saw ""La Violetera"" at some point in his life and was inspired to write the screenplay for ""Titanic"".  As we all know James Carmeron's ""Titanic"" (1997) ended up winning 11 Oscars and setting a new box office record during its run. ""La Violetera"" also broke box office records when first released but there are other similarities.

In ""La Violetera"" a poor flower girl falls in love with a rich aristocrat  who is already committed to marrying a duchess.  In ""Titanic"" is a poor boy who falls for a rich heiress who has a rich fiance. See the similarity? In both films the love affair between poor and rich is not accepted by family and society in general.  Both films take place when ""la belle epoque"" was in full swing (early 20th century) and in both films the Titanic is important to the story. Of course, in ""Titanic"" the sinking is the climax (and reason) of the film while in ""La Violetera"" it is used somewhat differently.  There are no spectacular sinking scenes and the heroine is not traveling with her lover but with the man who turned her from humble violet peddler to international singing star. However, the way the camera establishes that the singer is aboard the Titanic in a five-second shot is quite chilling and effective.  I do not want to spoil your enjoyment of the film but the ending in ""La Violetera"" is as bitter-sweet as the ending in ""Titanic"" except that the lovers are finally reunited in dry land and given a second chance.

I hope this inadequate DVD of ""La Violetera"" is commercially successful enough to spark interest from serious home video companies and move them to come up with a restored version state-of-the art version in the future.  Maybe it would also motivate them to release more Sara Montiel classics for which there has always been a demand in our country as witnessed by the many bootlegs that are presently available on Hispanic video stores and on the Internet. And yes! The English subtitles do help!",1238544000,19,5247,4.6957470010905125
