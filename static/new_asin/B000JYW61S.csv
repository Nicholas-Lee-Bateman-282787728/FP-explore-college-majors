8153579,1,B000JYW61S,"This is a glossy porno-type movie which has nothing to do at all with ""scripts"" and was erroneously listed under screenwriters and screenwriting because of its title.
What a mistake!  For me this kind of schlock is nearly worthless.  I guess the producers had the intention of making a glossy sex video, which it is.
I though it was going to be interviews from famous screenwriters, telling about their work.  The picture on the box should tip you off.  I found the listing, by title only, under
the heading screenwriting.  This is the problem with cross-referencing by title.  Believe it or not, the premise is supposed to be kind of a ghost story about a buxom young
babe.  That's about all the story there is.  It's just a plain exploitation video.",1300233600,3,751,4.679389312977099
