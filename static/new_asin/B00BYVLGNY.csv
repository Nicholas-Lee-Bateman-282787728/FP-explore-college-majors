And if it was off by a hair, I think technology has advanced and it surely would not be a problem in the unimaginably far-off future of 2016, right?  Or even 1987, if you want to count the year of this recording.

But there are SO MANY videos that are out of synch!  What the heck?  What is with that?  Is it my system?  No!  I have many DVDs that play fine.  And many others with varying degrees of synch problems, and they are all RECREATABLE.  And furthermore, they all play the same way on my sister's unit.  I have a 2013 Blu-ray.  She has a Pioneer DVD player from the 1990s.

What is with this?

Now, about this particular Ashkenazy DVD.  I admit, it is just barely off.  It is just barely perceptibly out of synch.  So why am I complaining about it?  Two reasons.  First, why should it be perceptibly off at all?  Unless there is a terrible earthquake or something, the piano does not normally sound until the artist hits the key.  In this case, the piano sounds just a split second BEFORE the artist hits the key.  That is wacko.  Granted, as I said, it is slight, probably only a few hundredths of a second (but please note, a second is a huge amount of time in this context).  If it is noticeable, it is irritating ... and it IS noticeable.

And secondly.  This video, unlike others, starts out with a spokesperson from VAI, talking about how great they are and how much they have done to restore these old videos.  Now if someone is bragging about their quality, and their quality is subpar, that is ironic.  I think the bragging rights should be reserved for those products that do NOT have such defects.

And I am aware there are some technical problems that are extremely difficult or impossible to repair.  For example one cannot increase audio fidelity, or visual definition if they weren't recorded that way to begin with.  But synchronization, surely, does not fall in that category.  If it is off by a constant amount (which it does appear to be here), surely, that is EASILY fixable with professional equipment.  But they have poor quality control, they don't view the finished product, they just slap the stuff together and sell it.

Try to enjoy it, but it's hard to.",1463011200,,2358,4.429906542056075
