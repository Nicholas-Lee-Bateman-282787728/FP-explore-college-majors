8745940,2,B019RGD8AQ,"Hal Roach himself has said it was a mistake and he was very unhappy with it. I can see why.
For those who don't know, it's the story of Spanky and Buckwheat, who during the Civil War, are an orphaned shoeshine boy and fugitive slave who join forces. They befriend a rebel captain who gets captured by the Union army, and with Alfalfa and the rest, build a makeshift fort with real gunpowder and cannons to attack the Yankees.
Funny, eh? Sad to say, not really.
While we're used to seeing the gang in adverse situations, the scenes of Buckwheat as a slave are jarring and disturbing. He cries after overhearing an adult say a slave without a master should be shot and hamstrung, and again over his intense hunger (causing Spanky to do the same). Its also a jolt to have Spank explain to Alfalfa that Buckwheat is his slave, although Buckwheat is never treated as anything less than a friend by the gang.
Then there are the equally unsettling scenes of the gang using real cannons and gunpowder against the Yankees (as opposed to them just playing at battle as in ""Dogs of War""). The yanks shoot back at the gang until they realize they are fighting children. (One of the film's many gasp inducing moments has the General scolding the Union Captian, "" Its a wonder you haven't killed all the children in the neighborhood."").Alfalfa doesn't have much to do, but Spanky and Buckwheat really show their acting talents here. One can just be thankful they were put to better use in the rest of the gang films. Its not very entertaining, but interesting as a conversation piece.he one good thing I can say for the film is that I like the way Spanky's friendship with and loyalty to Buckwheat transcends issues of race and social status, and that Spanky risks his friendship with the rebel soldier to feed and house Buckwheat. On the whole, while it's not something to relax with after work as I do with most of the Gang's canon and it's not the ideal film to have your buddies over for beer and pizza, I'm glad it has survived because the conversation it induces is one that is really worth having.",1496707200,2,2090,4.531746031746032
8745941,2,B019RGD8AQ,"I realize that one must consider that this film was made in an age when blatant racial bigotry was tolerated but this film made me sad. The usage of demeaning and derogatory terms for African Americans was constant, something I wasn't expecting considering the Our Gang comedies were so much less mean spirited. The way Buckwheat was depicted as being so dumb he didn't know he shouldn't be happy about being a slave took all of the joy out of the movie for me. View it as a historical document if you must but there is no way an unbiased person could enjoy this film, at least I couldn't. A 1930s film made about 1860s slavery just can't be amusing in any way IMO.",1490227200,,665,4.370967741935484

8745948,5,B019RGD8AQ,"Hal Roach's one attempt to bring the Our Gang franchise to feature films is a rarity to savor for fans of the short subject series. This new DVD looks miles better than it did on VHS or when they show it on TV. Ironically, this film is an Oscar-nominee (for Best Sound Recording). Highly recommended fun, with Buckwheat stealing the show.",1453680000,7,338,4.557377049180328
