8241463,5,B0011DXQ42,"This video, the story of the people who live in a Manila landfill, is a terrific window into third world poverty.  The film truly makes the viewer feel the pain of those depicted and gives at least some understanding of what the poor are up against.  It also challenges the efficacy of surface solutions.  (Due to international publicity, the Manila goivernment finally closed the landfill.  The result was that livlihoods of the poor were taken away.  They just moved to a different land fill).  A first rate film.",1349222400,,515,4.795454545454546
