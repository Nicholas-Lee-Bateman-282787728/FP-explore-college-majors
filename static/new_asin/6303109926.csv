Coach Jimmy Dolan's (Kevin Bacon) legacy would've been ruined after the NCAA investigation. Sanctions galore! Plus, being involved in a tribal war surely would've involved the State Department and Congressional hearings. This flick was epic. Hadn't watched it since I was a kid. I remember watching it in the theater several times. Mostly being the only patron in the seats. Loved revisiting and laughing a lot. #jimmydolanshakeandbake",1492560000,,575,5.620689655172414

Then I find out the movie got bad reviews because of something that had nothing what-so-ever to do with the movie - some technical problems.  Sort of like people dissing a restaurant because they didn't like the decor ... but then mention that the food was the best they ever had but gave it 1 star because of decor.  We must think about the people that made this movie or opened the restaurant.  This movie is worth seeing.  And the restaurant I'm talking about it amazing.  :-)",1482624000,,591,4.27027027027027

563088,5,6303109926,"This film makes me a bit nostalgic: 90s film-making if not at its best at a peak. An intercultural focus makes  this sports film  unique, and the  high-stakes finale has enough realism embedded within to  make it believable (as many sports movies are formulaic). It is more than sports, it's a movie about unlikely friendship, abandoning selfish motives, honoring one's culture,  the value of nuclear  family, and the true qualities of a leader. In short, its not really about basketball. Its about  doing the right thing  for the sake of doing the right thing, not  for any perks by association.

Current socio-political correctness may cast aspersion to this film as leaning towards a white savior complex.  I don't think it does...usually that  makes me roll my eyes but the script provides balance to where the indiginous culture is respected. Yes, Bacon gets a lot of screen time  but at the end of the game the Winnabe are their own victors, and have taught Bacon valuable lessons. Speaking of, his character has a great arc in  this film that makes it worth watching. It has a great soundtrack to boot.

It bothers me that this has so  many 1- star reviews and that may make people pass this up when they are scrolling through amazon video  looking for a good  movie to watch. It truly is a four+ star film and maybe amazon,  with their great customer  service,could send  out a new dvd copy to these  unhappy customers, because they are missing out on a great film.

I say these things ""only because I really mean it"" ;). Also, I have no idea why this film has poor reviews on imbd. When you watch it you'll see what I mean.",1466640000,8,1632,4.570934256055363

AND I have a secret, forbidden list--a list of films I really love but critics didn't. Such gems as Gung Ho! (with Michael Keaton) and The Golden Child (Eddie Murphy) grace this list. Out with snobbery, in with fun I say!
The Air Up There is definitely on my list. I hate basketball--I'm bored by sports in general. But I love this movie. It makes me feel good. Kevin Bacon is at his brash and cocky best as an assistant coach for a Catholic college team which apparently is expected to win big. When his personal pride costs him the loss of a promising prospect, he journeys to Africa to recruit a VERY tall fellow he saw in a home movie from a priest doing Good Works out there. When the basketball prospect turns out to be a prince and some tribal rivalry and mining interests complicate matters, the brash assistant coach has to find out what really matters.
Cliched? Sure. Predictable. I hope to tell you. But I love it anyway. The acting is amiable, the characters fun, the setting just exotic enough, the writing sure-handed, the story uplifting, and I got excited watching the basketball sequences even though I hate the game.
So what can I tell you? We talk now about not letting terrorists run our lives. I say don't let critics run your life either. I watch this movie at least twice a year and feel a whole lot happier when it's over. Try it.",1006646400,43,1480,4.5055762081784385
