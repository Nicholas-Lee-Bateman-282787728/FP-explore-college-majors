7340953,5,B011RO9QUC,"Ok, so I FINALLY had time to watch the movie today.  I have to admit that I wish you had prepared me a bit more.  I didn't realize that by watching your documentary I was going to suddenly time warp back to my high school days (I'm class of '92).  I didn't know that I was going to see in your students the same people that I went to school with.  I smiled as I remembered the parties, the boring classes, and the days my best friend, James, and I would skip school to go hang out at the arcade and blow our quarters (that we had earned by working at a crappy go-cart/bumper boat tourist attraction).  I was caught off guard by the feelings about my old high school sweetheart and how she broke my heart after graduation (I eventually got over it, but every so often i wonder what happened to her...).  And I was unprepared for the tears that freely flowed as I watched Rikki and her family watch her younger self.  It suddenly brought back memories of my time spent with my friends, especially James (who died in a drunk driving accident when we were 23.  Man, I miss that guy...).  I am a lucky, blessed man to be who I am, where I am these days, but I look back on my high school days with fond, bittersweet memories.  Thank you SO much for making this documentary and giving it to all of us.  If you're ever in Seattle I would like to buy you a beer, give you a high five, and play a round of Contra with you (it's how James and I spent many an after-school evening and it still brings a smile to my face when I think of all the ""adventures"" he and I had).
With much gratitude and respect.",1443052800,,1593,4.106451612903226
7340954,5,B011RO9QUC,"An excellent film full of humor and thoughtful insight. A real document of its era, and probably the beginning of the end of American education!",1442620800,,144,4.8
7340955,5,B011RO9QUC,"I graduated high school in 1985 and it was like this movie was made at my school at the same time. Having teenagers now, there's a remarkable difference in seeing how 'interactive' we were at that time with each other, as in personal interaction and not with electronic devices as the kids are glued to now. The movie portrays life in high school back then from the perspective of a foreign exchange student who offers a wonderfully giddy and fresh perspective on American kids and the value we placed on socialization (vs academics, really). While watching the 1984 version, there were so many similarities in all the stupidity and wonder that teens experience at such an awkward age. But it was the ""revisited"" part that gave me goosebumps, seeing the reactions of current day students who've grown up. It was heartwarming and universal in the trials and tribulations and general growing up process that hit so close to home. This film is timeless, poignant and off-beat enough to proclaim, ""damn, I can't believe we survived high school back then!""",1442361600,,1051,4.877094972067039
7340956,5,B011RO9QUC,"The original documentary is a great time capsule of high school in the '80s, shown from the perspective of a young Finnish exchange student.  Her journey from outsider to full-fledged member of Torrance High's Class of 1984 is a lot of fun to see.  The camera crew is a fly on the wall throughout the school year, tracking pep rallies, football games, classes, dances, and flyer parties in a way that seems hard to believe in the smartphone era.

At the end of the original documentary, the filmmaker catches up with his subjects, 30 years on, and we get to see what became of them - the metalhead, the party dude, and yes, the exchange student.  This coda is a satisfying bit of closure, a rare chance to see how the story turned out for these kids.

I really can't recommend this documentary strongly enough.  If you are a member of '80s Nation you need to see this film.",1442275200,,873,4.459119496855346
7340957,5,B011RO9QUC,"Great movie. If you want to know exactly what it was like to me a Southern California High School student in the 80's, this is your movie. Seen through the eyes of an exchange student, we view the locals from an outsider's point of view.

Many have compared this movie to that other 80's High School epic, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"". The difference between the two movies is that, while they both explore the 80's Southern California student stereotypes of the day, ""All American High Revisited"" is the real deal, with real people doing real things. You might identify with some of the films real life characters, or laugh at their now quaint pre 9/11 behavior, either way you will enjoy this slice of history from a long gone era.

To my mind, the original movie was a 10, but with the additional newly filmed material in the 2015 update, ""All American High Revisited"" goes to the head of the class and becomes a AP 10+.",1442188800,,925,4.532934131736527
7340958,5,B011RO9QUC,"I saw this movie in the theater and it's fantastic! It's like the real-life version of ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"". The movie is funny, smart, truthful and told with so much heart. If you want to see what life in Southern California was like in the 1980's, watch this documentary. It was a time of no cell phones, no ipads, no social media, life was so different for these kids than for kids in high school now. The film also revisits some of the kids 30 years later...! watch this for sure.",1442188800,,494,4.32258064516129
7340959,5,B011RO9QUC,"MY CLASS! Wow, it's hard to believe it that much time has passed! I have some great memories! Go Tartars!!",1441929600,,106,4.35
7340960,5,B011RO9QUC,Loved this documentary! I was a freshman at Torrance High the year they filmed this . . . This is an excellent look at the everyday teenager's life in the early 80s . . . Highly recommended!,1444176000,,190,4.162162162162162
7340961,5,B011RO9QUC,"We screened this at our library and the audience loved it.  No matter your age, this film brings you right back to high school (and it's not that bad this time around!). Even my kids watched it and couldn't believe how different things were just 30 years ago.  Definitely worth watching. And sharing!",1443744000,,300,4.6415094339622645
7340962,5,B011RO9QUC,"Very entertaining and riveting. A slice of life in a big American high school. Beautifully made,  great music. Not a bit sentimental or nostalgic, yet really emotionally engaging. Particularly fascinating in that it's a flashback to another time, yet one knows there are many high schools just like this right now. Also, the book ends of looking back from present day give it an amazing perspective. Highly recommend!",1443484800,,417,5.132352941176471
7340963,5,B011RO9QUC,"All American High Revisited is a great movie on a 1980's High School Experience through the eyes of a Finnish Exchange Student. This film fantastically crafted by director Keva Rosenfeld captures a year long  moment in time before the creation of reality television. If you experienced the music culture and clothing of the mid 1980's, you will enjoy this look back in time.  The where are they now component is always very interesting.",1443398400,,436,4.958904109589041
7340964,5,B011RO9QUC,"Everyone who went to high school will be able to relate to the antics depicted in this clever documentary. And, you don't need to suffer through a reunion to see where everyone ends up years later.",1443398400,,197,4.5
7340965,5,B011RO9QUC,"This takes me back to my youth.  I can't believe how engaging this film is, how funny this film is, and how it is so relevant today.  Don't miss it.",1443225600,,148,3.9
7340966,5,B011RO9QUC,"Refreshing, candid, funny view of a time gone by.  Enjoyable watch.",1443139200,,67,5.090909090909091
7340967,5,B011RO9QUC,"Excellent documentary that flows naturally, showing all aspects of Torrance High in the 80s..After the director dug up the old film and showed it at the Aero Theatre, he added footage shot at the Aero screening About thirty people from the class or faculty of 1984  showed up for the screening. This was on a double bill with that favorite, Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This film outplayed it. Torrance had a class about marriage and family life in which the students not only practiced getting married, but also divorced. The teacher of that class showed up at the screening. Not only that, two of the people who had a ""wedding"" in the class also showed up at the Aero. They had actually gotten married and were still married!! Seeing this at the Aero was a truly exciting film experience and I have been waiting ever since for this film to be released so the world can see it. Now here it is. A great film. (I grew up in Gardena which is right next to Torrance so it had some special familiarity for me)",1443139200,,1006,4.437837837837838
7340968,5,B011RO9QUC,"I caught this gem at the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival last year. Out of the 20 features I saw, it was easily my favorite. I went to high school in the 1980s, so I couldn't help but love the way it feels like a time capsule. But I've since watched the film with much younger friends and I think they loved it even more than I did. It was a stroke of genius to use a foreign exchange student as the audience surrogate. Her reactions to 1980s American culture will make this film universally appealing to audiences for many years.",1443052800,,536,4.316831683168317
7340969,5,B011RO9QUC,"Hilarious and nostalgic. Great documentary that should be shown at high school reunions.
Loved showing this to my teenagers so they could see what high school was like when their parents were young.",1443052800,,198,5.03030303030303
8724958,2,B011RO9QUC,Not really what I thought it was going to be.  Expected a little more of it though.  Not all kids had under age drinking parties.,1519171200,,129,4.12
8724959,5,B011RO9QUC,"This was filmed in my home town, in my high school, 17 years after I graduated.  Saw some of my teachers still there.  Nothing else was the same.",1493856000,,145,4.142857142857143
8724960,5,B011RO9QUC,Thank you!,1478131200,,10,4.5
8724961,5,B011RO9QUC,"Watched it with family members that went to torrance high in the 80's, including mom. It was a blast from the past and really cool to see people I knew in the movie, specially since I graduated 04. Great throwback",1463356800,,213,4.35
8724962,5,B011RO9QUC,"The director has combined his original high school documentary with updated film to show what has happened to the high school students.  The original documentary still holds up, with many laugh-out-loud moments and a reminder of at what life and technology were like not so long ago.  The added interviews of the students in middle age were especially touching- and makes this revised film all the more worth watching.",1460592000,,418,5.043478260869565
8724963,3,B011RO9QUC,"Looking for nostalgia, didn't find it.",1454112000,,38,5.5
8724964,5,B011RO9QUC,My hubby is in the movie!  He was a math teacher at the high school back then!,1451779200,,78,3.588235294117647
8724965,4,B011RO9QUC,A bit slow here and there but seeing the old with the new made up for it,1448928000,,72,3.2941176470588234
8724966,5,B011RO9QUC,This movie was really captivating and interesting given that I didn't grow up in the 80s. Seeing where some of the main characters are now and how they reacted to seeing the documentary was especially enjoyable. Loved it!,1445990400,,221,4.842105263157895
8724967,5,B011RO9QUC,"This movie is beyond fun... I had such a great time watching it.  Documentaries come alive when they reveal themselves to the documentarian, who can then reveal the story to us - and this movie did just that through the skill of Director Keva Rosenfeld, discovering the beautiful and fun Finland transfer student, Rikki.  His ability to capture not only this american high school in the 80's through her eyes, but in many ways, american life in general, which feels just as real today, as it was then.  Then as a bonus - we get to see some of these teens we fall in love with in the film, in present day, watching the history they created.  Just beautiful - a must watch that I'll be sharing with all of my friends and family!",1445299200,,726,4.395522388059701
