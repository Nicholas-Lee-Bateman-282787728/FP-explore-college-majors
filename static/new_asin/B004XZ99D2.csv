5577914,5,B004XZ99D2,"I love this show. It's the right mix of sex appeal, action and then more sex appeal. If you like TV and enjoy things, pick this up!",1309392000,2,131,3.888888888888889
5577917,4,B004XZ99D2,"God my '90s cellphone has a better resolution camera than this. Maybe less clothes on the ""actresses"" would help. So cheesy it's good. I keep this on while doing house work or spreading manure in the garden!",1425340800,,207,4.621621621621622
5577918,2,B004XZ99D2,"bad dialog, bad acting, bad directing...what more can be said?",1412812800,,62,5.3
5577919,2,B004XZ99D2,Weird movie that nobody watches except to look at the girls.,1405900800,,60,4.545454545454546
5577920,1,B004XZ99D2,"All this movie has going for it is scantily clad girls in superhero costumes, Your standard 70's cheesy B rated movie has better acting then this movie. The aspect ratios are all wrong and inconsistent from scene to scene. This movie is god awful the sound is bad and the acting is horrible. A bunch if high schoolers with cellphones could of made a better movie. However the tight fitting outfits on the girls are the ONLY thing worth watching in the movie and thats it.",1399939200,,471,4.488372093023256
5577921,1,B004XZ99D2,"it also had too many clothes & not enough skin. Many problems can be forgiven
if there is enough eye candy.",1393459200,2,107,4.142857142857143
5577922,1,B004XZ99D2,"the most horrible, cheap and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. Please do yourself a favor do not watch that movie.",1393372800,,116,4.571428571428571
5577923,4,B004XZ99D2,"Wondering what type of film this was, I was curious after reading the synopsis.

To start off I did enjoy its cheesy feel of a soft core porn flick, however that was not the case. As the title says I feel like this film was produced in low budget garage. If this film was created then I feel the ambitious middle schooler with an amateur camera has hope of creating something equivalent by the senior project at the local community college.

With that said I enjoyed the film. I don't know what type of films you're into but why don't you be the judge and give it 20 mins into the film to see if you can finish it.",1390867200,,614,4.151260504201681
5577924,1,B004XZ99D2,it stupied I scrolling and reading about movie and didn't mean to click purchase then I cant find a cancel button very unpleased,1390521600,,128,4.608695652173913
5577925,1,B004XZ99D2,"Oh so horrible! Bad camera work, bad acting, bad dialogue, just all around bad. Do not waste your time and/or money on this.",1390435200,,124,4.434782608695652
5577926,1,B004XZ99D2,never have I seen such trash... I did not watch very much. poor acting did nothing to aid the bad script.,1380844800,,105,4.0476190476190474
5577937,1,B004XZ99D2,"I like superhero films, even some of the indies, too. However this was worse
than what a middle school class project could put together with Adobe Premiere and using cell phones for cameras.
There are better fx used in fan based youtube videos!",1379894400,2,244,4.6976744186046515
5577938,1,B004XZ99D2,aaaaaaaaa  I could not even sit through it even for free. The girls have nice bodies but everything else about it is just crap. They need a lot more skimpy clothes they they had to counteract the bad acting and lack of any props over $5.00.,1378512000,2,240,4.217391304347826
5577939,1,B004XZ99D2,"Some of the costumes were nice. Nearly everything else was horrible. I always give low budget stuff a shot, and more often than one might expect I'm surprised at the result.

I was surprised this time as well. Surprised by how completely this failed. My expectations were low, but even they were not met.

Save your money. Save your time. Save your sanity. Watch anything else. Grass growing is more entertaining than this.",1377129600,,423,4.780821917808219
5577940,1,B004XZ99D2,"This movie was really bad a total waste of energy. Bad production quality, horrible acting and a completely ridiculous story. Don't waste your time let alone your money on this one!",1376956800,,181,4.870967741935484
5577941,1,B004XZ99D2,"You stop getting ""points for trying"" after 5th grade. Modern tech allows anyone who wants to make a movie to do so...that doesn't mean that everyone SHOULD.",1376611200,,156,4.814814814814815
5577942,1,B004XZ99D2,"the acting is worse than most middle school plays I went to, but because of the obvious poor acting I can't help but laugh...although that get old after 6 minutes. If you need a good non-humorous laugh you can watch it for first few minute...it is free through my Prime, but I would never pay anything to see this.",1376438400,,314,4.338983050847458
5577943,1,B004XZ99D2,"...the complete brain function shutdown I experienced running the show in the background off my Main PC while I worked on something else on my laptop. I just know that if I hadn't managed to shutdown the feed they would have discovered my body still sitting in front of the monitor, as I had become to dumb to remember to breathe. I shudder to think of what would have happened if I had been watching with my full attention. My best guess is...did you ever see that movie Scanners? Where the guy's head explodes? Yeah, like that.",1376352000,,529,4.463917525773196
5577944,1,B004XZ99D2,The series has very little dramatic appeal and the acting is very poor.  To be blunt there is no acting at all to mention . Don't waste your money watching this series.,1375315200,,168,4.25
5577945,1,B004XZ99D2,"I wish it was corny or cheesy, just bad acting, and not corny bad acting, like Middle School Drama class bad..",1375315200,,110,4.285714285714286
5577946,5,B004XZ99D2,I enjoyed it. It was available for free with my Prime subscription but I would have paid the 2 bucks to rent it. It's sexy and corny. The woman(Sylvia) with the fake Russian accent is gorgeous.,1374451200,2,193,4.388888888888889

8566031,1,B004XZ99D2,Not my cup of tea.  I did like some of the imagination put into the costumes (I'm speaking of the robots).  But I couldn't find anything else in the first 5 minutes that might have been interesting to me.,1429747200,,204,4.205128205128205
