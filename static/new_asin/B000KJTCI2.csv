8216525,5,B000KJTCI2,"Thanks Cal and Andrea for your very professional and thorough videos.  I love the cat walk throughs.  They are much needed little humor breaks.  Cal, I think you could have showed a lot less of your ""drag"" shows.  I really like the combo video and CD for voice training.  As bad as I am at practicing regularily I am already hearing improvements, and was complimented in group the other night!  The makeup video was helpful asx far as technique goes, I am used to painting acrylic on canvas and have to seriously retrain my hands!  All in all, there should be much for any new woman to learn in this set.",1326931200,3,604,4.387387387387387
