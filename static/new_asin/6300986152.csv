7808944,4,6300986152,"I have been looking for this exercise video for years.  I used it daily 'back when' and loved it.
My copy disappeared during a move.  When I found a copy on Amazon I was really excited.
It didn't matter that it was used.  I transferred it onto a disc so it's easier to use.
The price was right and the immediate shipping was excellent.",1402444800,,335,4.203125

7808948,5,6300986152,"I TOTALY LOVE THIS VIDEO!! I have gone thru so many videos of there videos because I have been working out with them for over 25 years! yep! Ive bought a lot of the same ones and have 2 new copies up in my closet!
I can put the pounds on but when i want to get them off.... i get back on this workout and with eating smaller portions and working out with my woman at large woman...it comes right off.
Why I like it so much is I have Rh. Arth. and can not jump all aroound.  This is a good challenge...but doesnt beat my joints up. These gals... are in great shape! They will suprise you! It will be hard to keep up with them!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WORKOUT!! The floor exercies are great!!! I love them!
I really back this video and the woman that have pulled it together and wouldn't say ""NO"" --when they had no one believeing in them!
I am not large...but I've had 3 babies... and have had a complete hysterectomy so i need to watch my colesterol.
You will get a good workout!

THANKS WOMAN AT LARGE!! YOU ARE MY HEROS- and I really do love you!!",1362096000,,1049,4.06280193236715
7808949,4,6300986152,"I've been looking for videos by this group for almost 20 yrs. Was glad to finally find them. It was sent to me so quickly. I haven't used it yet, but I remember that it would start, slower and easier and build, then as it would get more difficult, it would ease off again.",1244419200,,272,4.055555555555555
7808950,4,6300986152,"This exercise video was excellent for women who are older and bigger.  It's not intemediating like some others with their sweet young slender models.  I think it's great!  I just didn't like the voice of the instructor, it's too monotone and high pitched.  But shouldn't be a deterent.",1233187200,,285,4.875
7808951,5,6300986152,"When I weighed 197 pounds I started this video 2 times a week and I could barely keep up, because I was so out of shape.  But I kept at it until I was using it 3 days a week.  It inspired me to lose weight and I started walking ... now I am at 165 pounds.  It was so easy to use being over weight, and I did not have to see some thin woman working out, while I could not keep up.  As I lost my weight and gained flexibilty I started jumping more, and making it a higher intensity.  This overall is a great exercise tape.  I think anyone who is overweight, and wanting to get in shape should own this tape!!! It works your lower and upper abs, your thighs, it gives you your cardio, and starts with alot of stretching so you feel good and ready for the aerobics segment.  They break it into segments that builds the inten sity and gets your heart pumping! After doing this tape I always feel good about myself!",1026864000,13,909,4.016666666666667
