Robyn Malcom plays a great Cheryl West, she has certainly moved on and upwards from her days as nurse Ellen Crozier on Shortland Street. Malcom certainly does justice to the character the creator wanted to portray. Rachel Lang first came up with the idea after discovering the daunting income statistics in New Zealand. Malcom's character Cheryl is a fine example of many women in New Zealand - she is the glue that holds the family together, however her family often under-estimate her abilities and importance in the everyday family unit. Grant Bowler who appeared in 'Always Greener' adds to the shows hilarity providing a Male typecast-the New Zealand Bloke. Wolfgang 'Wolf' West only wants the best for his family, even if following the West way of life may not be the best way of life. The biggest surprise in the show has to be Antonia Prebble who plays Loretta West, a rebellious 15 year old. Although 21, Prebble manages to pull off the baby West. Clever, witty and motivated - so long as there is something in it for her.

The story lines may not be completely original (ahem *clears throat* think Desperate Housewives), but rest assured, it all has a nice little Kiwi twist, not to mention the endless one liners that will leave you thinking ""Is this really a New Zealand show?""

Outrages fortune has a 'trailer trash' feel to it which guarantees some non-PC humour, however don't be blanketed by this cover, there is a moral in there somewhere, after all it is a comedy/drama.",1225411200,2,1545,4.739776951672862
