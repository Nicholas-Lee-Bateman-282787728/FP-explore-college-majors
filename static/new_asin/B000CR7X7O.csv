I expected both DVD's to be good enough to present to a middle school social studies class to cover the basics of geography.  When I got the DVD's I was excited because it came in a nice case which made it look very modern, but the actual footage and narration must be over 20 years old.  The video quality is not that great by today's standards and the narrator's voice makes me think of the old film strips that we watched in Elementary School.  I was thrilled when I found these and though I had found a great bargain, but I seriously doubt I will show these to my students because they are completely boring.  I could not have been more upset with the programs and hope no one who wants to show a good program to their students will waste their time or money on these DVD's.",1151452800,13,836,4.2
