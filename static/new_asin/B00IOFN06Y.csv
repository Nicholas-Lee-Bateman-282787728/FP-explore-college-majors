6284158,4,B00IOFN06Y,three great movie musicals at a great price. I admit other than all being from MGM this is an odd combination but the price is so great it is hard to resist. This the DVD version not blu-ray and there are no extra's but the movies are so wonderful that all you have to do is sit back with your popcorn and enjoy,1430179200,4,311,3.9523809523809526

8644102,5,B00IOFN06Y,"A very odd combination of movies. I bought it for ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" having never seen ""West Side Story"" or ""Fiddler on the Roof"" anywhere but on stage. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy them on my screen at home. Although there is very little these movies have in common (even the intended audiences are very different), I never sit to watch three movies in a row anyways. I really enjoy them all. All three have great and memorable music in them that is stuck in my head days after I see them.",1443916800,,505,4.382978723404255
8644103,5,B00IOFN06Y,"Three of my all-time favourite movies in one collection.
I remember seeing Chitty Chitty Bang Bang when it first came out. And then only occasionally on broadcast TV years later full of commercials and cuts. Now my son can see it and he enjoys it as much as I do.
Fiddler on The Roof - always a classic, always brings a tear. Such a wonderful movie.",1442016000,,349,4.303030303030303
