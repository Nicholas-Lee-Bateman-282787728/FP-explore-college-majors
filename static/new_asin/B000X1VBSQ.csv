The actors look good in their costumes -- though the women's hair styles are much more 1964 than 1664 -- and the sets, ships, and locations are picturesque, but boy are the acting and direction BAD.  There is absolutely no sense of pacing.  Camera shots linger pointlessly on a face or scene, actors deliver their preposterous lines in the most turgid manner, and the story CRAWLS from it's dull beginning to it's absurd conclusion.

To add to the ruin of it all, this is a ""spaghetti swashbuckler"" so all the actors are Italian, apart from the token American, Lex Barker!, and they filmed the story in Italian and later were dubbed in English, so their lips are out of sync.

Oh, yes, and the DVD has a dark and scratchy print that has been cropped from its original widescreen aspect ratio.  You'll thrill as one horrible actor has a conversation with another -- who has been mercifully cropped from the screen!  You'll cheer as the few ""action"" set pieces are executed in almost pitch-blackness!

With terrible acting, little (and bad) swashbuckling, preposterous dialogue, and the lamest of stories, this disaster cries out for Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, otherwise, save your doubloons.  You can spend a better evening with the telephone book and your favorite beverage.",1335052800,,1454,4.873983739837398

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to budget box brands. The films themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else, plus their prices are often reasonable.

SINISTER has a good track record as far as transfer quality.

The Euro-made PIRATES OF THE COAST has American Lex Barker heading a cast of mostly Europeans. The single exception is sixth-billed John Kitzmiller. This Michigan-born African-American expatriate appeared solely in movies made on the continent or in Britain. His most prominent role (for American audiences) is ""Quarrel"" in the first 007 picture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DR-NO/dp/B000RPCK10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DR.

SYNOPSIS--
Curiously, there's little swordplay in this swashbuckler about a Spanish naval officer who first does battle with pirates and then joins them in order to serve justice on a tyrannical island governor. Costumer features Barker as Commander Luis Monterrey.

On the flip side of this IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT disc is HERCULES THE AVENGER (1965), with British actor Reg Park as the ancient Greek hero.
