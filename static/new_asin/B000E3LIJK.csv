2487078,1,B000E3LIJK,"This is an unauthorized documentary, just like the last few done recently with critics giving their opinions about Thin Lizzy. The quality of the live footage is terrible and thrown together with the worst audio imaginable. If you are a Thin Lizzy fan you probably already have this footage on video.

Why in 2006 is their not more ""official"" Thin Lizzy concerts and footage availiabe(we know it exsists) with all the enhancements that could be done with older footage? These bottom feeders that produce this ""junk"" hoping fans throw them a few dollars(like I did) should be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs!! If you do buy this dvd, like I did ""you will be sorry."" I wish I knew what I would be expecting before unwrapping, so at least I could return and get my money back.",1142812800,57,783,4.633093525179856
2487079,1,B000E3LIJK,"If you have the cd (or vinyl of course!) of L&D, or if you saw them live on this tour in 1978 then do not buy this DVD under any circumstances. This has been not been approved by the band and you can see why. It is advertised as the ""Live & Dangerous"" DVD - but there is just one major flaw - it contains no music or footage from Live & Dangerous !!!! If you are expecting to see a film of a concert this is not it. It is a critical review (exactly the same rubbish as on the ""Thin Lizzy - Inside"" DVD)by a group of people who constantly interrupt every song (ONLY 1 MINUTE of each song shown - and only 6 songs reviewed !) featured while they talk about chord changes and whether all the singing/playing was 'live' which wears thin after a very short time. Shocking to think someone actually planned this whole thing and got paid to do it. An absolute insult to Phil's memory.",1142294400,55,877,4.104651162790698
8105462,5,B000E3LIJK,"I've owned this DVD for a year or so now, so imagine my surprise reading the first ""review"" of this classic Lizzy show where the ""reviewer"" claimed he was gyped by a ""misleading advert"". I'm not sure what he/she is talking about or what happened but that has NOTHING to do with this DVD. This is Thin Lizzy live when they were at their peak.

That being said, I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD. I was turned on to Thin Lizzy back in late '74 (I was in the seventh or eighth grade) and loved them immediately. Two years later, they opened for Queen at the then-standing Paramount Theatre in Portland Oregon. Queen were touring behind 'A Day At The Races', with Thin Lizzy promoting 'Jailbreak'.

Exactly. One HE** of a show on both counts and for those of you lucky to be old enough to have seen Queen in their heyday live, believe me when I say that Lizzy more than held their own and this DVD captures that same intensity and musicianship in spades. Grant it, this show is from their '75 tour, but trust me, they were just as good, dare I say better, the following year so this will very good indeed.

OK. 'Nuff said. Again, trust me - you will NOT be disappointed in this DVD and if there are any questions as to what you're getting - this supposed ""documentary"" some are complaining about or the full, live DVD (there is some backstage footage in the beginning, but that lasts only five minutes) - take a few minutes and call an Amazon customer service rep and double check to be sure of what you're getting. That's what they're there for and no, I don't work for, nor do I have any relationship with Amazon or any of their employee's, I just happen to like the company, but I digress. Call the C.S.R.'s if neccessary and then when it arrives, sit back, crack your favorite icy-cold beverage and enjoy the full, LIVE, Thin Lizzy experience.

If you're not a fan already, you will be once you see this. I guarantee it.

Cheers!",1263513600,,1939,4.389972144846797
8105463,2,B000E3LIJK,"This is largely as described by the reviewer DJKK and is not a live performance DVD.  It's way more an analysis of the record with bits of interviews and chord tutoring thrown in.  OK if your looking for this type of critical analysis from a purely informational standpoint but by no means a concert DVD! ! ! !  The review included here by SKY is NOT FOR THIS PRODUCT... it is a review of the other ""Live & Dangerous"" DVD. I love the fact that Amazon lets us (the end consumers/fans) review the releases but I really wish someone would quality check the reviews submitted.  SKY's review does not belong on this product.",1231113600,,619,4.451327433628318
8105464,4,B000E3LIJK,"I just received ""Live and Dangerous"" today and preceded to sit down and watch. On disc one is all the video performances. The ""Live and Dangerous"" concert is pounding and as electric as I thought it would be. Phil Lynott's base is really prominent in the mix. The guitars are a little buried which is unfortunate. You can really feel the kick drums from Brian Downey if you have a decent sub. I loved the show not being able to see these guys in their prime before the ""classic"" line-up broke up. For that alone this DVD gets four stars. I was slightly disappointed with the sound though. Maybe a little tweaking with my 2 channel could make it somewhat better. Furthermore, the second show was also a keeper. Lynott does look a bit tired to me. The guitar work is fantastic all the way around. Again, the sound is not all that cleaned up. The Top of the Pop stuff is just OK for me. The bonus CD is also OK, but again, the sound is not top notch. For me, if the video performances are this outstanding, why oh why couldn't they clean up the audio a little better? What I am most mystified about is where is the song ""Bad Reputation"" on any of these performance?. I thought they toured under that name at one time. It isn't even on the regular ""Live and Dangerous"" CD. I know this might be nit-picking but if the sound was even a little better it would be a solid  5 star for me. For it's historical essence, it is 5. One star docked, for me, for the sound.",1197849600,,1457,4.241007194244604
8105465,5,B000E3LIJK,"This is a great package.  The remastered concert on the DVD is superb and the live CD of a 1975 Derby concert is a real plus. Although the sound quality of the CD isn't perfect, the performances clearly indicate the power of what would become known as the ""Classic"" line-up of Lynott, Downey, Robertson and Gorham.

I have heard several recordings of the great Brian Downey's solo on Sha La La. As a pro drummer and teacher who has admired Brian's work for years, I believe the Derby version  on the CD to be the best of Brian's work  I have heard.  This soft-spoken man is a genius on the drums, one of the finest to ever grace a stage.  I rank him up with John Bonham, Neil Peart, Carl Palmer, Keith Moon and Ian Paice among the all-time greatest rock drummers. There is no higher tier, yet  Brian is virtually unknown.  Treat yourself, watch, listen, and be amazed at Thin Lizzy's amazing power if you are a drummer, enjoy the opportunity to learn something from a master.

One thing SKY missed in an otherwise fine review: The Derby CD songs are taken from a forthcoming Thin Lizzy album to be titled ""UK TOUR 75"".  The list with the Cowboy Song is what will be on the future release, not this CD.",1197331200,,1201,4.36936936936937
8105466,5,B000E3LIJK,"Live and Dangerous arrived at my home via Air Mail today from Amazon UK, and I couldn't wait to get it into my DVD player. I was anxious about whether it was a Regionalized DVD (only Region 0 and Region 1 play in US DVD players), especially since the product description on the Amazon UK site suggested that it was Region 2...but it's not Region 2; it's Region 0 (worldwide).

This performance of the 1977 Live and Dangerous tour was captured at London's Rainbow Theatre. And this show should be held up not only as an example of the way a rock group should perform live, but also as an example for DVD music producers on how to deliver an excellent product.

The Live and Dangerous concert is all show. No indulgence by some videographer that thinks a viewer wants to see effects like cut to black and white, psyschedelic swirling pictures or other video effects. This was a very pleasant surprise considering that kind of video-malarkey was quite popular in the 70s.

The full screen picture has been completely restored and looks terrific. Most importantly, the video doesn't jump around every 4 seconds, so you really get to see the performance in a way that feels like you're back in '77 with a front row seat to the concert.

If you've got a surround system, you're in for a pounding Hard Rock experience. The sound has an amazing 5.1 DTS remix. If you've got an old DVD player or old surround system that doesn't decode DTS you're out of luck...there's no Dolby 5.1...Dolby Stereo is the only other choice besides DTS.

The Live and Dangerous line-up of Phil Lynott, Scott Gorham, Brian Robertson and Brian Downey define Thin Lizzy. And all of the guys are on for the Live and Dangerous show at The Rainbow. Lynott's high energy stage persona is incomparable. The guitarwork between Gorham and Robertson is legendary and it's played precisely at The Rainbow show. And Brian Downey's signature drumming is captured in all its glory.

For the classic Live and Dangerous Rainbow show you get the following set list:

1. ""Rosalie""
2. ""The Boys Are Back in Town""
3. ""Emerald""
4. ""Dancing in the Moonlight""
5. ""Massacre""
6. ""Still in Love With You"" - The liner notes actually suggest that this song is ""Call on Me"", but The Boys describe each song track by track during the interview segment, and they confirm that it is, indeed, ""Still in Love Wth You"".
7. ""Don't Believe a Word""
8. ""Are You Ready""
9. ""Sha La La""
10. ""Baby Drives Me Crazy""
11. ""Me and the Boys""

You also get Lizzy's 1983 ""Farewell"" concert (Robertson is out/John Sykes is in) from the UK's Regal Theatre; you get a selection of performances from the Top of the Pops television show from 1973 - 1979; and you get a 45 minute interview segment from the summer of 2007 with Robertson, Gorham and Downey.

All of the music on this DVD has been remastered in DTS; the interviews are stereo. Songs at The Regal overlap only with a few from Live and Dangerous as do some of the Top of the Pops selections. Between the two (aside from what's in the Live and Dangerous set), you get:

""Whiskey in the Jar""
""Jailbreak""
""Waiting for an Alibi""
""This is the One""
""Cold Sweat""
""The Sun Goes Down""
""Holy War""
""Baby Please Don't Go""
""Fighting My Way Back"" (CD only)
""Wild One"" (CD Only)
""Suicide"" (CD Only)
(The liner notes of the booklet also suggest that ""Cowboy Song"" is included somewhere in the collection of tunes, but darned if I could find it.)

The packaging and accompanying booklet of the DVD are awesome. Plus you get a bonus CD of a 1975 concert recorded at Derby College in the UK. This is a pretty sweet package.

It's the Thin Lizzy DVD release we've all been waiting for. Any Lizzy fan will enjoy this disk immensely. There is no question here. Find a way to add this to your collection.",1194652800,11,3759,4.544378698224852
8105467,5,B000E3LIJK,"I have owned this video in VHS format no less that at least 3 occasions, and am pleased to see its release in Digital format with enhanced 5.1 sound.  The ""Live and Dangerous at the Rainbow"" concert remains one of my favorites displaying Thin Lizzy in their prime with what I consider their most powerful lineup during their entire history.  The added bonus features are icing to an already RICH cake.

Just a note of warning to consumers in the United States.  I have contacted the stores offering this title, and have not found an NTSC version available so far. I would contact the seller prior to purchase to confirm the product you are getting.",1193875200,2,648,4.608695652173913
8105468,5,B000E3LIJK,Excellent dvd to have and to own. Live and dangerous is at the height of their career. The album itself was recorded mostly at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia in 77 for the King biscuit Flower Hour show. And This DVD shows them at their best.,1192233600,,244,4.326086956521739
8105469,5,B000E3LIJK,"The ""Live and Dangerous"" video recordings:
One can not argue that Thin Lizzy's ""Live and Dangerous"" record is one of the most influential live albums of all time. The original album consisted of material captured during the period 1976-1978; yet there is considerable evidence suggesting that the majority of the tapes emerged from a 1978 show at the ""Hammersmith Odeon"" venue in London. The Live and Dangerous Video however was recorded at a quite smaller venue ""The Rainbow"" theater in London also in 1978. So we are talking about different versions of songs. In addition, the album features 17 tracks, while the video features only 11. The ""Live and Dangerous"" video has been available on DvD for quite some years though Amazon. Jp . Indeed ""Vap"" video put together a release that included just the 11 track show with stereo only sound.

Specific version and bonus features:
This particular release features additional live video footage captured during different eras. The most highly acclaimed being the ""Regal"" theater gig during the Lizzy farewell tour in '83. All is expected to be in 5.1 Surround sound.
Finally an additional CD is mentioned to be completing the package with unreleased (yet unidentified) material.

8105471,1,B000E3LIJK,"What is it with this Classic Rock label and their misrepresentation of concerts and unreleased footage.  The ""Inside Thin Lizzy"" was a joke and this tries to carry on in the same way but this joke is not funny.  They ask way too much $$$ to listen to mostly unknowns opinions of Thin Lizzy.  Anyone want to hear my opinion???  I own all the recordings and have seen them live 3 times in the 70's.  That qualifies me as much as anyone on this piece of....Anyway, this is not the concert we have all been waiting for so keep saving your money and say your prayers, one day it will actually see the light.  I just hope that I am not too old to enjoy it.  BEWARE of this product!",1173225600,9,675,4.1461538461538465
