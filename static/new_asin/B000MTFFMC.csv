UNSTOPPABLE

This was a very historic event in my mind, mainly because of the huge upset that regardless of what people say now was not expected.

1. KURT PELLEGRINO VS JUNIOR ASSUNCAO-this was a quick opening fight to the event with a great rear naked choke applied by Kurt. Junior did the best he could in this one but he was over come early by Kurt. A great quick opening bout. 5/5

2. CLAY GUIDA VS JUSTIN JAMES-the first round of this fight was amazing, both of these guys came to fight and win. It was back and forth between these two the entire round, Clay even gets caught in a deadly arm bar yet slips out. The second round was just as exciting as it went back and forth until it had 20 seconds left in the round. That is were it ended with Clay getting the win with a nice rear naked choke. 5/5

3. YUSHIN OKAMI VS KALIB STARNES-good enough first round between these two as most of it is just a feeling out process. Other then a few kicks and punches, and a take down that almost ends it there isn't much in this round. The second round is less active as it is mostly in the clinch the whole round, there is a good take down though. Round 3 more exciting as Okami not only mounts Kalib but also pounds his way to a victory. 3.5/5

4. SPENCER FISHER VS DAN LAUZON-this is another quick yet exciting fight as Dan gets two great take downs and even supplies some good ground and pound. But Spencer ends this towards the end of the first with a great knock out, it was obvious that Dan wanted no part of that. 5/5

5. CHEICK KONGO VS CARMELO MARRERO-round one was real good as Marrero who I thought at the time was going to get destroyed completely dominated Kongo. He took Cheick down and pounded on him the entire round, Kongo really had no answer for it. Round two was exactly the same except without all the ground and pound, although Kongo almost ended it with a guillotine choke. Round three was a little different because it was almost entirely on the feet, except for a little while with Kongo on top this time. Carmelo takes a split decision, although it should have been unanimous in my opinion. 3.5/5

6. JON FITCH VS KUNIYOSHI HIRONAKA-the first round of this fight is amazing as Fitch spends almost all of it inside a deep triangle. He comes back at the end of the round and almost stops it him self. The second round sees Fitch deliver some great kicks and when these two go to the ground it is nothing short of a chess match between these two warriors. In round three both are bloody both are tired and both are still in it giving it all they have. This is by far one of the best fights on an over all good card, Fitch takes a well deserved decision. 5/5

7. SEAN SHERK VS KENNY FLORIAN-this was the fight that would crown the first Lightweight champion after years of the title laying dormant in the UFC. Once the fight started Kenny was taken down, but then it got even. These two battled the entire time on the ground, both on offense and defense against each, usually it is one or the other. The second round is a bloodier version of the first, both just battle on the ground for the most part. The third is just like the first two, but with a great explosion from each at the end. The following round followed the same formula as the previous, but it was never boring. The final round went the distance looking just like the others, but like I said this fight never seemed boring. In fact to me it felt pretty epic. Sean Sherk wins by decision and becomes the new Lightweight champion. 5/5

8. RICH FRANKLIN VS ANDERSON SILVA-this is that fight I was talking about earlier, I don't care what you say everybody thought Franklin was going to take this. Even if some one thought Silva was going to win this I bet no one saw a first round domination coming. I remember watching this live and thinking no way Rich just got it put on him that bad. Of course looking back now I' am sure every one can believe it and even say they knew it would happen. But at the time it was unbelievable. Still to this day one of the best beat downs in history, right up there with GSP destroying Matt Hughes. Silva just killed Rich's body with some vicious knees and then landed a killer head kick. 5/5",1221350400,,4213,4.262828535669587
8171998,4,B000MTFFMC,"So, Anderson Silva smeared Chris Leben in a Fight Night in about 49 seconds, right? You take out Leben like that, you've got to be pretty good, or are you? Let's just give the man a title shot to see how good he really is. Doesn't sound too fair, does it? Anderson Silva taking on a seasoned champion such as Rich Franklin. How long could this possibly last? But Rich Franklin admits that this will be his toughest test. Anderson Silva really has no doubts. But then again, neither did Nate Quarry in UFC 56, and Franklin knocked him out, and Quarry was O-U-T! So Franklin is prepared to defend his Middleweight Championship belt. And for the first time in a little while, the UFC is prepared to give a Lightweight Championship to one of two contenders. Sean Sherk and Kenny Florian want that victory! Sherk simply claims that he isn't about to take Kenny lightly, because he is fighting for a world championship title. And with Sherk's experience, he's only lost twice. But in UFC 56, he was TKO'd by none other than GSP, and quite decisively! Kenny Florian, on the other hand, hasn't lost since the first Ultimate Fighter Finale when it went rather quickly against Diego Sanchez. But since then he's shown he isn't one to be messed around with. His elbows are lethal, and fighters such as Alex Karalexis found that out. Kenny sums this fight up pretty easily by saying, ""That first mistake he makes, he's cooked."" But will it really be that easy?

This is a pretty good night. There are 8 fights total, and I'll list them below.

Kurt Pelligrino vs. Junior Assuncao: Two quick and scrappy lightweights. This doesn't take too long and finishes in the first round.

Clay Guida vs. Justin James: Both men ready to get it on! Wild and wooly Guida against an opponent with some fights under his belt. Both are making UFC debuts, and one wins in round two!

Yushin Okami vs. Kalib Starnes: This features two veterans, both seasoned in the game of MMA. Starnes comes off some great TUF #3 time, while Okami knows his game and knows how to win. This is a decent battle that ends before the third round comes to a close.

Spencer Fisher vs. Dan Lauzon: When big brother Joe, KO's Jens Pulver in UFC 63, then little brother, Dan, gets to take on Pulver's teammate. And just like the Pulver fight, this ends in the first round as well. Good start or bad start for 18 year old Dan Lauzon? YOU watch the fight!

Cheick Kongo vs. Carmelo Marrero: Kongo has knock-out power, that's obvious! But newcomer Marrero has some great ground n' pound. This goes to a split decision that is well earned. The right man won the fight.

Jon Fitch vs. Kuniyoshi Hironaka: This is a great battle! It goes to a unanimous decision.

Sean Sherk vs. Kenny Florian: Well, this is a battle, and it goes to a decision. One man gets the title, while the other still put up a great fight the whole way through!

Rich Franklin vs. Anderson Silva: This was by far the surprise of the night! Needless to say, it doesn't make it past a round. WOW!!!

A night full of fights, some quite surprising! So if you haven't seen this yet, go for it! Not disappointing at all. By the way, meet Anderson Silva!",1206921600,,3160,4.489547038327526
8171999,5,B000MTFFMC,This was a good card with two title fights and a solid undercard.  Ignore the other reviewer who gave it one star because of the image quality.  It is fine and he probably got a bad copy of it.,1184371200,2,193,3.923076923076923
8172000,5,B000MTFFMC,"Anderson Silva has arrived in the UFC, and dominated the champ.  One of the worst title defenses in history.  I respect Franklin but wow,  shows holes in his game.  Rest of card is good,  not the best but solid.  Anyways the picture is not that bad actually it looks pretty dope on my TV.  In the end if you enjoy mma this is worth purchasing.",1181952000,,343,4.184615384615385
8172001,1,B000MTFFMC,"Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage.",1179878400,4,592,4.701923076923077
