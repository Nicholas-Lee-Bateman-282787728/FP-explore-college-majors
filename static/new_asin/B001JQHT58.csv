3659465,5,B001JQHT58,The information in the video very informative instructive and helpful. It was done in a tasteful and respectful manner. Thank you.,1398297600,5,130,5.238095238095238
3659466,1,B001JQHT58,"Don't waste your time or money, there was very little new information on the topic of human sexuality presented in this video.",1393286400,2,126,4.7727272727272725
3659467,2,B001JQHT58,didn't like it it was weird. Not what I had in mind when I rented it.  Wouldn't recommend it.  don't know what else to say,1390953600,2,122,3.84
3659468,1,B001JQHT58,"UHG! (and not in a good way) Basically, this is quasi-porn, but I think real porn would be more educational. Karinna Kittles-Karsten keeps mentioning Chinese terms, but it just seems like marketing, and I think she just made them up. Bad acting, no useful information, and these actors had ZERO chemistry. Well, I hope they were aspiring porno actors rather than real couples because these people were NOT in love. After watching half of it and hearing ""erotic juices"" way too many times, we hit stop.",1379376000,2,501,4.837209302325581

3659470,1,B001JQHT58,"We both watched this video with anticipation of learning something new.  We didn't.  It is all common sense stuff and nothing we didn't know about.  Only deep into the video and the last remaining minutes were some different positions shown.  Still, nothing I was impressed about.  I returned the video.",1365638400,,303,4.98
3659471,1,B001JQHT58,"Sacred Love-Making purports to bring the secrets of Taoist mysticism to your bedchamber, because that sounds like a really good premise and the producers are still stuck in the Taoist culture fad of the 90s (remember the Tao of Poo?). The result is a painfully American sexual instruction video slathered with cornball Orientalist design sensibilities. Essentially, if one of those Asian character shoulder tattoos frat boys get became a short film about having better sex, it would be this one. Lording over proceedings is Karinna Kittles-Karsten, who apart from having some really unfortunate initials also has the gently folksy southwestern accent of a home decorating show presenter (this may explain why the demonstration couples practice their night moves on artfully arranged pole beds in the woods).

Laden with platitudes about intention and reminders to think about how good sex feels (thus inadvertently highlighting a difference between Taoism and Tantric Buddhism, I guess) Sacred Love-Making is pretty light on actual ideas. Advice like ""you may be shy about oral sex, but talk it out. Remember women like oral sex too!"" isn't going to be a revelation to anyone buying a video about pretend Chinese monk-boning, and in spite of warnings to the contrary none of the techniques in this film are particularly out there or risky. You could have the same learning experience and way more fun just HAVING sex, and you wouldn't have to hear the words ""erotic juices"" every 6 or 7 minutes.

In the end Sacred Love-Making is a solidly awful entry in the overall regrettable annals of sexual health videos: a campy, vague journey that is too short and feels too long in which people who obviously have no real sexual issues to overcome act out unoriginal and forced-looking sex poses to a public domain new-age porn soundtrack while the narrator is hard at work sounding out of place. With little sexual benefit and no connection whatsoever to Taoism this is probably a movie you're safe skipping.",1361232000,22,2001,5.0606060606060606
3659472,4,B001JQHT58,It did teach some things that were actual techniques.  Talked about chakras and moving energy.  Good info on Sacred Sex!,1345507200,4,120,4.95
3659473,5,B001JQHT58,"SACRED LOVEMAKING opened my eyes to the many ways in which men and women can deepen and enrich their love-lives.

In the film, Karinna Kittles-Karsten, a best-selling author and relationship expert, leads a pair of couples through numerous exciting and spiritually-involved sexual practices.  Her guidance is informed by Taoist love secrets, making the knowledge that she provides her pupils with both ancient and enduring.

There is much that most people could stand to learn about sexual intimacy and SACRED LOVEMAKING is positively opulent with new techniques and ideas that can help partners to deepen their sexual satisfaction and cause their emotional connections to blossom.

Owning this DVD will certainly stimulate your mind and encourage you to discover new ways to find pleasure and passion with your lover.",1232496000,18,818,5.417322834645669

3659513,2,B001JQHT58,"The other reviews on this were simply ""I didn't like it"" without any explanation why or details on the video. This is a self-help video in the style of an infomercial that might have been caught on TV late at night in the early 1990s. The host, self-proclaimed (and self-promoting) ""love educator"" Karinna Kittles-Karsten, speaks on pseudo-new age sensuality in a slow, droning manner as the video showcases two seemingly inept couples who are probably actors. They are shown in bed together mostly clothed with brief nudity as the host narrates her advice. Near the end of the video, various sexual positions with Kama Sutra-like names (""Dolphins Linking,"" ""Steeds Galloping,"" ""Cranes Entwining"") are displayed with topless nudity as anything more graphic is carefully shielded. It is all inadvertently comical but not in a way that it is worth watching.",1447545600,10,855,5.158273381294964
