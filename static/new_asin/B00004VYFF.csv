Synopsis: Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci play two star-crossed lovers whose attempts to reunite after an unintential two year separation are constantly thwarted by fate and the devious actions of a third party determined to keep them apart.

Critique: Released in '96, `The Apartment' receives the highest marks on every level. First of all, two of my favorite foreign film stars head the cast; Vincent Cassel (Max) and Monica Bellucci (Lisa), which is further complimented by a magnificent performance by Romane Bohringer (Alice). The cinematography is superb, artistically capturing the urban, Parisian terrain which seems to ooze from the screen. The camera skillfully captures the spirit of this legendary city and the atmosphere of the landscape incorporating that romantic ambience into the separated lovers Max and Lisa. The soundtrack is melodic, melancholy and apprehensive, a perfect fit for the taut, expertly constructed plot unfolding layer by complex layer on the screen before the viewer. The storyline is unbelievable intricate, flashing back and forth between the past and present with each time shift unveiling some new secret, some previously unsuspected nuance to the story that seems to change everything you had known and understood up to that point.

`The Apartment' is first class entertainment from beginning to end and believe me when the end finally arrives you'll be taken totally by surprise just as I was. This is a classic that definitely can be watched again and again. Buy it and save yourself from repeat rental fees.",1184457600,42,1593,5.338645418326693
1359282,4,B00004VYFF,"L'Appartment is truly a French movie worth watching and one of those films that should never have been remade made into an ""English"" equivalent.

The acting from the principle characters are superb (Bohringer, Cassel, and Bellucci).  I will agree with the others of the Hitchcock-esque, it's one of those movies where you should pay attention so as not to miss the most minute detail.

I'm not able to comment on the DVD quality since I've got a bootleg.  :o)

As for it's American counterpart, Wicker Park, treat it like the plague and watch the original version because Harnett is no Cassel, by any stretch of imagination.",1182643200,2,624,4.849056603773585

If there are such problems they you realy need to buy the European version as this is one of the best films you are likely to see.

It has so many twists and turns that to go into any detail about the film would simply spoil it for you.  Describing it as 'Hitchcock' in style is probably the best description I can think of.  The acting is superb with both Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci at their best (Bellucci rarely does have a poor day in the office when it comes to her acting)

After watching it I went back to the beginning of the film when the jeweler asked Max (Vincent Cassel) which of the three beautiful rings (how he described them) he will choose.  Max will think about it and we find out who he choose at the end of the film.  He's not sure about his engagement to Muriel when he overheard the voice of his lost love Lisa (Monica Bellucci).  From there on he must find her and find out why she has left him two years ago without a word.  He finds clues which may lead him to an unsuspecting surprise.

1359287,3,B00004VYFF,"As always, people don't pay attention to what amazon wants - which is reviews of the PRODUCT - FOCUS YOUR COMMENTS ON THE PRODUCT.  I guess people just can't read.

L'Appartement is a terrific film, one of the best French films in the last two decades.  Sadly, American films these days can't touch it, although, naturally, they tried by remaking this marvelous film as the horrid Wicker Park - of course, they changed everything about it that worked.

It's great to finally have this available in the US.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that it's released by Lion's Gate, who should just fold up their tent and go away.  They are simply the worst company releasing DVDs.  The image isn't anything to write home about, but it's the subtitling that's disgusting.  Instead of proper subs, we get subtitles for the hard of hearing, complete with descriptions (children playing) and subtitles for the lyrics of an AMERICAN song.  Pathetic.  It's great to have separate subs for the hard of hearing IF they have regular subs for those who aren't hard of hearing.

Lion's Gate should hang their head in shame, but they won't because they simply don't give a whit about their product or their customers.",1156723200,15,1204,4.735576923076923
1359288,5,B00004VYFF,"L'Appartement became an instant favorite when I saw it a few years ago, although on revisiting it I did find myself wondering for a while if I hadn't over-valued it. But then, a third into the picture it takes a sudden left turn and what had been a relatively simple romantic drama about lost love suddenly became a much more complex piece of work touching on the nature of desire and the way accidents of timing and interpretation can change fate.

What's most fun - or most frustrating, depending on how you like your narrative delivered - is the way it doubles back on itself, revealing that the passing details in one person's life can be major ones in another's, even revealing that for the first third of the movie both we and the main character haven't noticed the presence of one key character.

1359305,4,B00004VYFF,"After seeing Wicker Park, starring Josh Hartnett, in 2003 and becoming obsessed with finding out how different that American remake was from the French original from 1995 -- L'Appartement, written and directed by Gilles Mimouni -- I finally had to have a copy of the film that catapulted Vincent Cassel (Black Swan, Derailed) to international stardom. I found out that L'Appartement was hard to find. It was a postmodern quest in that I was obsessed over a film about obsession with a capital ""O.""  For those who don't yet know, Vincent is the son of the late great French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel.

Years passed and I occasionally would view my DVD copy of Wicker Park, if only to be mesmerized over the beautiful song that plays during the opening credits as Hartnett's Matthew shivers and struts through Chicago's streets, and fascinated with breathtaking snowy scenes shot both in ""the Windy City"" and, farther north, in Qubec province.  Eventually, I couldn't take the torture anymore and turned to Turner Classic Movies' (TCM) website in July 2013, et voil ... I purchased my copy of L'Appartement, the subject of this review on Amazon.com.

An aficionada of French films, I was a bit leery as I opened the DVD case because I was pondering:  What if L'Appartement is the one French movie that isn't better than its American remake?  I allowed my mind to wander to a few tepid American re-don'ts including The Man Who Loved Women; My Father, the Hero; and Intersection.  Then I remembered how watchable Unfaithful was and turned anxious.  But then I recalled how Unfaithful wasted Richard Gere's enraged-husband potential (he was an implausible adulterer in Intersection), teased me with Olivier Martinez's virility and gorgeousness in the role of Paul, and got by on Hollywood good girl Diane Lane's sensually neurotic performance as Constance.  By the time I tapped the ""Play"" button, I was ready. For years I had yearned to discover what was missing in Wicker Park.  The answer was emotional depth and existential intensity.

Portraying la femme fatale in L'Appartement is Monica Bellucci; in Wicker Park, Diane Kruger.  That both Bellucci and Kruger play a woman named Lisa is just one nod to cinematic master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock although only one of the ladies (Kruger) is a blonde.  (Hitch fans may recall Grace Kelly's stunning Lisa Freemont in Rear Window as well as the subliminal theme song ""Lisa"" that wafts across the Greenwich Village courtyard in various incomplete stages whenever the songwriter-neighbor goes to pieces at the piano in his apartment across from invalid voyeur and photographer L.B. Jeffries' [the excellently ""cast"" Jimmy Stewart].) However, other references in both L'Appartement and Wicker Park to Rear Window and to other Hitchcock films (Vertigo, Spellbound and Marnie immediately come to mind) aren't so obvious in the sense that they can't be seen or heard but felt.  The protagonists' brooding temperaments contrast with euphoria; visual blurriness contrasts with mental clarity; and darkness explodes into light -- all of which are part of all the aforementioned films' intricate puzzles that will draw you into the intersection of memory and obsession.  But L'Appartement's puzzle may leave you nearly as traumatized as Max in the way that Rear Window's whomayhavedunit left you nearly as alienated (though, eventually, vindicated) as Stewart's L.B. Jeffries.

My purpose in reviewing such a rare DVD as L'Appartement (The Apartment) is twofold:  to turn on people who are shy to viewing foreign films by offering one that is refreshingly original, and to satisfy fruitless searches for this DVD by people who appreciate la cinema franaise.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there were more than a handful of Amazoners in the United States alone who always have wanted to see tour de force Cassel portray Max, a young man so involved in a frantic search shaped by romantic and erotic obsession that he becomes subsumed to the point of insanity. Besides Hitchcock films, not since Frantic -- an unfairly underrated suspense film by Roman Polanski starring Harrison Ford -- have I been so riveted by such an obsessed protagonist as Cassel's Max.

Before Frantic I would say Last Tango in Paris (in which it is implied that conventional intercourse is pass, evidenced by the reckless and degrading carnality taking place inside a barebones Passy apartment in the ""City of Light""), which starred Brando in the grotesque role of a debauched widower and war veteran, was the last time I was affected so emotionally on the theme of obsession.  Admittedly however, L'Appartement (The Apartment), unlike Last Tango in Paris, attracts more sympathy from viewers because we -- no matter what gender -- find ourselves getting more and more absorbed in Max's stream of consciousness and rooting for his love quest with each compelling frame.

Suffice it to say:  Mimouni's L'Appartement is a brilliant film and, unlike Wicker Park, is not for the faint of heart.

The ending scene had me looking at the screen with my mouth wide open from the last minute curve ball. Not to say the plot didn't have plenty of curve balls that the audience was sure not to expect. I had to re-watch the movie to catch the subtle statements from the jeweler, to the obvious moments of obsession by all characters.

1359311,4,B00004VYFF,"The Apartment is a well-plotted story about a multiparty romantic entanglement that may qualify as a love quadrangle, or perhaps a love pentagon or love hexagon.  Although nearly every element of the early scenes turns out to be significant in the overall storyline, it is not until well into the movie that the viewer realizes what is really going on and the true relationships between the characters.  In fact, it takes the characters quite a while to figure out their true relationships.  The end result is an entertaining movie that rewards the careful viewer and provides multiple puzzles to be solved.

The story revolves around four primary single adults in Paris.  The actresses with the two female lead roles both give memorable performances.  Monica Bellucci is absolutely gorgeous with her alluring eyes and smartly-trimmed hair.  In perhaps a bit of typecasting, Bellucci portrays a woman so beautiful that one of the male leads, expertly played by handsome Vincent Cassel, cannot get her out of his mind years later, even in the presence of his fiancee.  Romane Bohringer portrays the other female lead, a more sinister character, and she throws herself into the role with relish.  Her character is at times passive, at times plotting and aggressive; in love and out of love; sometimes truthful and often lying; a perpetrator and a victim; and, professionally, a nurse and an actress, both on stage and off.  It's quite a role, and Bohringer does a great job with it.

There may be a message that The Apartment is conveying: given the ease and speed with which present-day romances progress to the intimate stage, adults who play the field are presented with many options, and it can be hard to choose among them to find true love.  And true love may be nothing more than an unhealthy obsession.  But the primary attractions of The Apartment are the intricate plot and the fine job turned in by the lead actors, with some beautiful scenes of Paris exteriors and interiors thrown in for a bonus.  The Apartment is worth seeing not once but twice, to capture everything that is going on and to learn how it all fits together.",1355788800,4,2136,4.848484848484849
1359312,4,B00004VYFF,"<strong>L'appartement</strong> (Gilles Mimouni, 1996)

Here's the thing about relationships: everybody lies. Not necessarily to the person with whom you are in a given relationship, though lord knows that happens often enough, but you lie to everyone else <em>about</em> your relationship. (""Here comes the heartache, move-out day, excuses for my friends..."".) About an hour into <em>L'appartment</em>, Gilles mimouni's romantic thriller (or erotic drama, take your pick) that echoes Billy Wilder's film of the same name not nearly as much as it does Edward Dmytryk (<em>Lured</em>), there's a great scene--the movie's best--where the true absurdity of the fact that everyone in it save Max Mayer (<em>Sheitan</em>'s Vincent Cassel, excellent as always), our main character, is lying through his or her teeth is exposed. He's in the back of the shoe shop owned by his best friend Lucian (<em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em>'s Jean-Philippe coffey), and the two of them are swapping stories about how last night went. We hear Max's story, and of course we know it's true because we just witnessed it (though we assume he leaves out the part, in the telling, about drunkenly tearing open a pillow and scattering feathers around his girlfriend's apartment). Then Lucian tells his story. I can't tell you the kicker, because we'd be getting into major spoiler territory, but just after Lucien tells the first half of it, we get a flashback to what his night was really like: his girlfriend, Alice (<em>He Died with a Felafel in His Hand</em>'s Romane Bohringer), pled illness and they head home before they even make it to dinner, at which point she ditches him entirely. It's the kind of black comedy that runs throughout this movie, which also presages Neil LaBute's nasty late-nineties comedies (<em>The Company of Men</em>, <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>).

It's a damn good movie (though it is not without, as we'll discuss later, a few structural flaws), and is especially notable nowadays as an early role for both Cassel and Monica Bellucci (they met on the set and married in 1999), who plays Max's ex-girlfriend Lisa. But I'm not quite sure what it is about the movie that caused someone in Hollywood to seize upon the idea of remaking it--which they did, in 2004, as <em>Wicker Park</em> (cf. review 31Jan05). The fact that they felt the need to rename the film should tell you most of what you need to know; the fact that they thought pretty-but-vacuous Josh Hartnett was an acceptable replacement for Vincent Cassel should tell you the rest. You've heard me batter on about stupid Hollywood remakes that didn't need made before, I'll spare you here.

As I said before, though, the movie does have two flaws, which are either minor or showstoppers depending on how you look at it. The first is that, like many movies that use extensive flashbacks, some of those flashbacks are handled badly. Mimouni's original ""this is a flashback"" trope is plastering a really, really bad stoner wig on Cassel in the back-in-the-mists-of-time scenes. It does its job, but as the parallel timeline comes up towards the present, obviously, Max had to cut his hair sometime to achieve the power 'do he wears in the present-day scenes. One of the flashbacks during the movie's climax is, in fact, a bit of the opening scene of the movie, repeated. It's very short, the characters have dressed similarly throughout the movie, etc. Five seconds after it's passed, you suddenly realize ""wait, that wasn't present time!"" and need to rewind. The second is a little nastier, and has to do with the closing montage (mostly the closing shot, but actually the last two or three minutes of the film); Mimouni (who despite having been showered with praise for this flick, has directed nothing since but a TV movie as I write this), who also wrote the script, suddenly seems to have found himself with a couple of minor plot threads he didn't know what to do with, and so wrapped them up in the quickest, cheapest way possible. It's the movie's most annoying bit, and considering how good most of what came before it is, it's even more annoying. You might want to turn it off a couple of minutes before it ends. All four of the principals are fine (and look for the great character actor Vincent Nemeth, best known on this side of the pond for <em>The Transporter</em>, in a small role), the script is great when it brings its A game, and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (<em>Leon: The Professional</em>) is great at putting the camera in the perfect place to maximize tension. (Note, for example, in all three--I think there are three--shots looking up from the lobby of Lisa's building, for example, the camera is slightly tilted.) Good stuff, recommended despite its flaws. *** ",1333065600,,4771,4.974937343358396
1359313,4,B00004VYFF,"The problem with watching Alfred Hitchcock's films is that they leave you wanting to see another and another, to savour his unique and playful blend of romance, tension and intrigue. Unfortunately Hitch has gone to the Bates Motel in the sky, and no one has really proven to be his equal.

L'appartement is the closest to being a ""new"" Hitchcock film that I've ever come across. The director, Gilles Mimouni, makes the connection to Hitchcock clear from the beginning with a lush, romantic soundtrack (courtesy of Peter Chase) that immediately recalls Vertigo. Also like Hitch, Mimouni uses sweeping camerawork and a rich colour palette to heighten the eccentric nature of his story.

Ah, the plot. Well, in the interest of not revealing too much I'll just say that Max, played by Vincent Cassel, thinks he catches a glimpse of Lisa (Monica Bellucci), the love of his life who seemingly vanished two years previously. Max has just become engaged and is due to fly to Tokyo for an important business trip, but he decides to put everything on hold to track down Lisa. Naturally, not everything is as it appears and the story, filled with flashbacks and unexpected plot twists, becomes a romantic mystery and a thriller.

Looked at as a whole the plot verges on the nonsensical, but then so do many of Hitchcock's films. Half the fun and purpose of Hitchcock's films is to see what happens to ordinary people when they're caught in an extraordinary series of events. And where Hitchcock liked to play with the language of film, Mimouni focuses on creating a series of overripe, romantic interiors that are stars on their own right. In fact, you could almost call this a film about apartments, as each of the several featured in the story are given a distinct and arresting look. And even Paris, which doesn't need much help to look mysterious and romantic, is made to look lusher and more delectable than the real thing.

During the final section of the film, as the loose ends are being tied up and various mysteries are revealed and solved, you'll be amazed at the cunning of the plot. You'll also want to immediately re-watch it to understand how it all fits together. The only real flaw in the film is that Max is forced to make some unlikely life choices in order to keep the plot moving along, but that's a minor quibble. Call this one Hitchcock's last great film.

1359314,4,B00004VYFF,"In my quest to see more of the gorgeous Monica Bellucci I snapped up a copy of this little French 'romantic thriller' and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story. The plot deals with elements of infatuation , deception, and obsession amonst a group of, essentially, four indiviuals (2 men & 2 women) and the complexities of their past, present, and future relationships with each other. The tension of the film is created by a lot of unrequited passions as the characters sort of chase one another around attempting to make a connection of one kind or another. There are some clever Tarantino-esque time shifting editting techniques that add to the sense of a jigsaw puzzle of plot elements ultimately coming together to a cohesive ending, of sorts, that is satisfying and frustrating at the same time. Bellucci is lovely, as always, though this is not one of her steamier roles (no nudity) - still she heats up the screen whenever she is in the scene. The film has a decidedly European feel to it - a refreshing change from Hollywood cliches - in French language w/ English subtitles - an engrossing and entertaining watch.",1306281600,3,1137,4.776649746192893

1359328,5,B00004VYFF,"One facet of this movie that no one mentions but it really is a factor is that two of the actors on the screen are perhaps the sexiest, most magnetic and charismatic stars movie goers have seen in awhile.  These two are Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci. They made the movie in 1996 and actually married one another in 1999.  IMDB lists them as still married.  So perhaps the film was helped by this real life sizzling and chemistry.  It is difficult to shoot a film involving love, attraction and sexuality if the two actors are absolutely flat with no chemistry between them. This French film involves them as former lovers who cannot find one another again.  He does spot her one day and follows her to her apartment.  However, when he hides in her apartment, he discovers it is someone who looks like her who lives there.  But he was sure he saw her, not this other woman.  This is a very nuanced, layered film. Cassel is definitely the lead because the camera is always on him and he is the one who is searching.  Just writing about it, I feel another watching coming on! Some have compared this to Hitchcock and De Palma and it is a fair comparison.  Truffaut was another Frenchman who paid homage to Hitchcock with THE BRIDE WORE BLACK. This film is like that one in style, elan and suspense.

Bellucci is - if possible - de-glamorized here most of the time.  She wears a backpack!  And pants!  And athletic shoes!  Such are the pressures when you are Monica Bellucci.  To see she and Cassel together at the starts of their now famous careers is a treat.

The movie itself is tortuously complex and riven with holes, most notably: Cassel's Max (rising corporate hotshot and fixer) is tasked with flying to Tokyo to swing some major deal.  But he [THINKS HE] overhears Bellucci's Lisa - his erstwhile lover and one-time _almost_ live-in mate - in a happenstance semi-encounter and becomes frantic to track her down.  So, what to do?  He pretends to wing it to Tokyo, goes out the backdoor of the airport (passing the fiance, Muriel,  who dropped him in the process), calls the high-profile clients in Tokyo telling them he's been unavoidably detained, and makes calls from Paris to Muriel pretending he's in Tokyo.  Muriel is, by the way, Max's CEO's sister...but no big deal to the director: nothing ever really becomes of all this.  Huh?  In real life, Max's ruse would be found out in a day, and the film's entire premise shot.  But, whatever, right?  It annoyed me that something that blatant would essentially pass unnoticed.

The movie's second-half turns into a head-spinning roundelay between Lisa, Max, Lisa's spurned friend Alice (or is she Lisa?) and Max's friend Lucien.  Despite the complexities and bulldozer-sized plot holes, The Apartment still made for 2 hours of enjoyable watching.  Writer/Director Gilles Mimouni (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicker-Park/dp/B00067BBMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicker Park</a>) employs a really neat trick of showing you an event from a character's point-of-view, then revealing, say, 40 minutes more of the story, and then showing you the event again from another character's point of view...by which time the quizzical first-time showing has new meaning and gives you an 'ah ha!' moment.  It's very carefully constructed and artful stuff.",1253404800,5,2181,5.358823529411764

1359331,2,B00004VYFF,"I missed the news that this had finally gotten a DVD release in the U.S., so when I stumbled on it in a store for about $10 I snatched it up without a second thought.  That'll show me.

The transfer is not so hot, as others have said--kind of soft and gauzy.  You may think the movie just looks that way, but there seem to be other DVD releases of this movie that have plenty of detail and sharpness, so something seems to be off here.

What really drove me up the wall, though, were the English subtitles.  I don't know if it's a Lionsgate thing or what, but this is the second foreign-language film of theirs I've gotten where they botch the subtitle track.  This time, they include an SDH subtitle track (subtitles for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing) as the only option.  Not only do you get the dialogue translated for you, but (English) song lyrics and prominent sound effects are described in text.  Subtitles like this are a great option to have if you need them, but if you don't it gets maddening to see ""[knock on door],"" ""[clatter],"" ""[car engine starts]"" and every other thing you can imagine popping up onscreen every few seconds.  I'll just be doing what I should have done in the first place and picking up the French disc.",1236816000,,1236,4.433628318584071
1359332,1,B00004VYFF,"I have noticed the criticism of the quality of the Region 1 DVD. At times it does look like the cinematographer smeared a gel on the lens for a blurred effect.  At other times it just looks blurred for no reason.

If that were the only reason I did not think much of this movie I would accept the mediocre quality and move on.  But there are many other things that make this quite second-rate.  One can start with the plot. It is not only convoluted but trite as well.

Yes, it is a story of obsessive love. Since you may not be able to tell the obsessives without a scorecard, and it does not give anything away, Max (Vincent Cassel) obsesses about Lisa (Monica Belluci), Alice (Romane Bohringer, a dead-ringer for Tracey Ullman) obsesses about Max. Daniel brings up the rear obsessing about Lisa.  Lucien, Max's best friend, dates Alice but does not obsess.  He is normal and, therefore, clueless throughout.

Max obsessively (of course) cancels an important business trip to Tokyo when he thinks he has heard Lisa's voice in a phone booth coming through a vent into a bathroom he is using at a hotel.  He later thinks he sees her on the street, ala Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. He believes that she left him without a word two years previously after they had been happily living together.  Little does he know. Telling you what Alice does would give the ""mystery"" away.  Let's just say it has been done much more artfully in other movies.

Bohringer and Cassel render poor performances as obsessive lovers. Neither is very convincing.  What agony or ecstasy they show looks very much like they are trying to act; so unconvincing.  Daniel, the third obsessive lover is not in the movie enough to show either emotion. It is probably just as well.  Daniel's character is so poorly developed that one can find nothing but a bad temper to provide motivation for the final scene with Belluci's Lisa. Very weak. Belluci's talent is terribly underutilized in this movie. Her talent, as showcased in ""Malena,"" is well hidden here.

The writer-director Gilles Mimouni is all too obvious in his attempt to imitate Alfred Hitchcock. If you want a Hitchcock imitator watch Brian De Palma movies.  It seems that De Palma has spent his whole career trying to imitate Hitchcock and he does a much better job than Mimouni. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery but it is not the road to originality. The musical score is basic De Palma. It never changes its rhythm. It is relentlessly dark in mood regardless of the scene.  It sounds like it was recorded in an echo chamber

If you want to see the torture and agony of obsessive love brilliantly acted, directed, and beautifully filmed, skip this movie and buy ""Vertigo.""  It also has a gorgeous film score. If you have already seen ""Vertigo,"" skip this movie anyway.  Hitchcock never had to resort to people just barely missing each other as often as this movie does in order to create suspense.  The myriad of ""just missed"" coincidences is a hackneyed made-for-TV convention not suitable for adult viewing.

I have no idea why this movie was ever titled ""The Apartment.""  Almost nothing happens there until the final scene.  It could just as easily have been called ""The Cafe"", ""The Bar"", or ""Lucien's Shoe Store"" for that matter. More action occurs in those locations than in the apartment.

Nothing in this movie seems real.  That is not to give it credit as surreal.  It is to say that it is not believable; even for one willing to temporarily suspend their sense of disbelief.  The fact that Max would have any attraction for Alice after he finds out what she has done is a prime example of art not imitating life at all.

Buy this movie only at a ""going-out-of business"" sale. I mean cheap.",1226361600,6,3741,4.649923896499239
1359333,5,B00004VYFF,"The previous reviewer (Lim) did a great job of summarizing without giving anything away. Apparently, I liked this movie a whole lot more. This movie was a classic french love story - no hollywood ending here. The soul of the movie is best explained by Alice, as she is confronted by Max of her duplicity - Haven't you ever felt such love that you were willing to do anything? Love is the real main character. We see idealized love (Max and Lisa), we see obsessive love (almost all of the characters at one point), we see pragmatic love (Max and Muriel & Lisa for Daniel), etc. There is no right or wrong in this tale. According to Nietzsche, anything done out of pure love is never evil. Hmmm.... All types of love are displayed and the ending is most fitting for each character. I believe that Alice's character was the most intriguing as she starts obsessive and grows into true love.

This is one of those rare movies that you can sit back and enjoy simply on a plot driven level or discuss all the different levels of love and what the ending meant. Either way, it's a great way to spend 1.5 hours!

Hollywood re-made this movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicker-Park/dp/B00067BBMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicker Park</a>), which was good but nothing like this very french tale. The U.S. version focused more on the obsessive angle and copied many of the same scenes with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction/dp/B000065NIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction</a>&nbsp;twist.",1203552000,4,1590,5.485714285714286
1359334,2,B00004VYFF,"THE APARTMENT is a story whose complicated structure requires all of the viewer's concentration.  If you are not competent in French, be prepared to have a hard time following the plot which consists of several flashbacks.  The subtitles are of little value.  Some of them are downright annoying; for example, ""Sound of water pattering,"" and ""car engine starts.""

I plan to get the story and read it because I feel that somehow this film did not do it justice.",1203465600,5,460,4.784810126582278
1359335,4,B00004VYFF,"I'd already seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WICKER-PARK/dp/B00067BBMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WICKER PARK</a>&nbsp;which was practically a scene-for-scene remake of this film (except for the ending) -- so the mystery was gone. If you're not familiar with either film, be warned that these plots use flashbacks extensively, sometimes going over the same moment from different perspectives -- gradually revealing complex and interesting layers of the story. And, both movies cheat -- making the viewer think a person is somewhere, when in fact, they're somewhere else. For some, it'll be fun. For others, frustrating.

For a few reasons, I recommend seeing THE APARTMENT (L'APPARTEMENT) first. (1) It's the original. (2) It's easier to understand the man's obsession when the love object is Monica Bellucci rather than Diane Kruger. (3) It might be clearer to follow the time-hopping since Vincent Cassel uses radically different hairstyles to help with the distinction. (4) Vincent Cassel is more energetic and open as this nervous, love-obsessed young man while Josh Harnett is the exact opposite. (4) Gilles Mimouni's direction in the French version concentrates more on the drama and so the pacing seems faster then Paul McGuigan's picture postcard style.

The role of the mousey friend makes for some difficult comparisons. Romane Bohringer of the French film is truly plain-looking and she gives a very good performance. In the American version, the role is played by the lovely Australian actress Rose Byrne made to look mousey. But she's so appealing as the insecure and hurt girl that it almost turns story upside down.

Frankly, I prefer the film version with Rose Byrne. But, your preference may be decided by the ending of the the films -- which differ dramatically.",1198886400,,1827,5.61231884057971

7924430,5,B00004VYFF,"This is a very interesting romantic story. Actually, there is another movie made out of the same story with some modifications, and that movie is ""Wicker Park"". Both movies are great, and both have a great cast. ""Wicker Park"" is actually an American version of the story and ""The Apartment"" is a French version, or European version. ""The Apartment"" has better music and better picture, while ""Wicker Park"" has a better ending. In ""The Apartment"", the main character Lisa died with an insignificant figure at the end and the guy (Max) who chases after her eventually chooses to stay with his fiance instead of the woman (Alice) who chases after him. To me, that's a sad ending. In ""Wicker Park"", on the other hand, the guy conquers all the complications and eventually unites with Lisa, ignoring everything else in his life . That's a satisfying ending. Another good thing about ""Wicker Park"" is the scene in which Max kneeling in front of Lisa and letting her try new shoes and later in the movie he did the same to Alice. Oh, it's just very beautiful, sexy and breathtaking moments",1438041600,3,1082,4.73015873015873
