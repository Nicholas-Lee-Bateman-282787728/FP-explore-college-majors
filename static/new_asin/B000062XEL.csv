1685532,5,B000062XEL,"Each of the 3 DVD's is a great and challenging workout that will really get your heart rate up and the pounds off.  Sweatin' 3 and Sweat and Shout are both total aerobic workouts, while Sweatin' 2 is an aerobic workout that also has sections for arms and abs.  One important note: for Sweatin' 2, you will need a high-backed chair for part of the warm up, and you also need hand weights or similar for the arm workout.  The 3 DVD's together make for a great way to vary your workout day to day and they are very fun and entertaining as well.  Even my kids like to do the videos with me!  In just 6 months, thanks to Richard's workouts and a good diet, I've lost over 50 pounds!",1056758400,,677,4.137404580152672
1685533,4,B000062XEL,"These 3 workouts are great for building up fitness. Sweat and Shout was originally titled Sweatin' to the Oldies 4, so it does belong in this boxed set. I do understand being disappointed that Sweatin to the Oldies 1 wasn't also included in the set though. My favorite of the 3 is Sweat and Shout...I love to dance, so the workout is more like fun than aerobics for me. But, for those who have a hard time following dance steps, try the other two first. When you get them figured out, the fast pace of Sweat and Shout will be easier to follow. Richard doesn't give many cues, but give the tapes a chance...keep doing them. After you've done the workout several times, you will catch on to the dancing.",1051056000,19,701,4.4

7958046,5,B000062XEL,"Richard Simmons is kind of a personal hero, not going to lie.  But these videos are a great blast to the past in more ways than one, and Richard Simmons is very encouraging.  And they actually provide a pretty decent workout.",1440115200,,225,4.463414634146342
7958047,5,B000062XEL,A doable workout for the beginner or someone with physical limitations (check with your doctor first). A person can easily adjust movements to adapt to their own level or needs. Music is great and Richard is fun to exercise with.,1437782400,,229,4.75

7958049,5,B000062XEL,very happy and pleased with the item. Would recommed to other people to buy. This item arrived on time. Great.,1358812800,,110,4.55
7958050,5,B000062XEL,"These are great, I tried every diet and ""plan"" and just couldn't do it. I wouldn't go to a gym or in ""public"" to workout.  I was too embarrassed to exercise in front of people.  I carried a picture of myself at my highest weight, and started doing Sweatin' to the Oldies 2 every morning (took a bit to get through the whole tape, but added more and more every day), I changed between the different Sweatin' to the oldies and Disco Sweat (keeps it interesting and I think that helps as you use different muscles some of them).  I went from a size 22 to a size 2 (and no I am no spring chicken and have been heavy all my life).  I still work out ""almost"" every day with Richard Simmons and have kept off the weight for 2 years now.",1130803200,15,729,4.076923076923077
7958051,5,B000062XEL,"My wife enjoys doing the exercises and the music that accompanies them.

She does them in the privacy of our living room in the morning. Not much results yet, but still fun.",1127606400,4,173,4.40625
7958052,5,B000062XEL,"All of Richard Simmons' workouts are very fun to do.  My favorite of these workouts is ""Sweat and Shout"".  I have a bad back and knee trouble so these workouts are great for me.  You can adjust the level of intensity according to your fitness level.  I find that I can get a great workout no matter how my back or knees feel.

The people in the videos are normal everyday people which is nice too.  It's a more realistic environment than some of the other aerobic instructors try to portray.

Richard doesn't do very well with the instructions.  He doesn't often give cues for change so you need to do the tapes a few times before you really get the routine down.  But once you get them down, it's really fun.  The music is great!  I would recommend these to anyone.

I always look at the descriptions to find which songs are played but they never tell you.  So here is a brief run down.

Sweatin' to the Oldies 2:  Fever, Windy, Rescue Me, Locomotion, Respect, Jailhouse Rock, Big Girls Don't Cry, Oh-Pretty Woman, Summer In The City, My Boyfriend's Back, and Breakin' Up Is Hard To Do.

Sweatin' to the Oldies 3:  Do You Wanna Dance, Gimme Some Lovin', The Name Game, Out Of Limits, Louie-Louie, Build Me Up Buttercup, California Dreaming, Born To Be Wild, Rockin' Robin, I Get Around.

Sweat & Shout:  Shout, Heatwave, Proud Mary, Up The Ladder, Devil With A Blue Dress, Someday We'll Be Together, Mony Mony, The Wanderer, Dance To The Music, Shotgun.

They are not by the original artists, however the singers do a pretty good job with them.  I'd also recommend ""Disco Sweat"".",1113868800,51,1580,4.512367491166078
7958053,5,B000062XEL,"I'm in the 40+ generation. The music in here is right up this ""golden oldies"" lover's alley! The workout DVD's are great as well. The first one, Sweatin to the Oldie's 2, has a nice combination of aerobics and light weight/stomach workout. It's a fantastic one to start with. My favorite is the last - Sweat and Shout. After 6 months, I still do this one 3 times a week and still get a good cardiovascular workout. Combined with a sensible eating plan (no fad diet for me), I've lost 55lbs. What's nice about watching this is that you can see how the people who are pretty out of shape do the movements as well as those who are in good shape. You can adjust your movements accordingly. Richard's movements are somewhere in the middle. The only ""down"" side is that if you are uncoordinated like I am, it takes about 5 or 6 viewings to learn the routine.",1073001600,22,852,4.364779874213837
7958054,4,B000062XEL,"I've tried several different workout videos and ended up back at these. They are pretty corny, but I like that they portray regular people exercising, not just perfect bodies. The dances, though hard to learn at times, are fun and interesting. There is a good mix of stretching, aerobic, and strengthening exercise. The clothing and hairstyles drive me crazy, but all in all it's the best I've found so far.",1060214400,14,407,4.828571428571428
