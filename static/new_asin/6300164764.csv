Miss Patti Labelle my only gripe is that this concert was recorded
In the mid to late 1980 on old VHS format & should have been
Re-mastered to DVD format for better picture & sound quality!",1271462400,3,253,4.404255319148936
7804622,5,6300164764,"This is one of the best concert tapes of Patti Labelle live. If your a collector of live soul concerts, this is one of the best! Someone out there may come close to this performance, but I know they will not be able to perform any better. Patti does it all in this concert video.",1032480000,5,279,4.090909090909091
