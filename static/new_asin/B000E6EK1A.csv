2499092,2,B000E6EK1A,"As a big fan of ""Race"" and ""Masterpiece"", I was really disappointed by this video.

They should have shot this in a club, not in the studio.  Technically, it's pretty amateur looking and the audience doesn't feel ""present"".

Content wise, it's not Mooney's best material.  I found the whole show a bit flat.

Mooney's still an original and well worth hearing though.",1156896000,11,366,4.838709677419355
2499093,2,B000E6EK1A,"The first time I ever noticed Paul Mooney was on Chappelle Show. I didn't realize he wrote for shows like In Living Color. He was brilliant on those 2 shows, however he may need to stick to writing and or doing small skits because his stand up is weak.

The man has no charisma. He's too serious and can't deliver jokes properly. He can be a bit extreme and made me wonder if he really means what he says or he's just joking? I'm neither black or white, but all I can say is that if you're white you might want to watch and see what some black people find funny about you. And if you're black you probably will get a kick out of it. For me this DVD didn't hold my attention for too long. I turned it off after 30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend buying it, maybe a rental at best if you can find it. Although everyone's opinion about comedy is totally subjective, this one barely got a chuckle out of me.",1156550400,10,901,4.119318181818182
2499094,4,B000E6EK1A,He is so funny and to keep that poker face through out his comedy routine is funny in its self.,1151971200,7,95,3.8
2499095,5,B000E6EK1A,"If any of you missed out on Mooney's 'Race' (1993) & 'Masterpiece' (1994) CDs,

this new DVD will give you a taste of what we knew all along. Mooney is

brutally honest with his unique approach, and it's refreshing to see

him put a different twist on a few of his classic jokes.

The interludes with the white guy are pretty funny, and

Tim Reid's interview of Paul is an eye opener for

new fans. All in all, this DVD is the BEST BARGAIN of 2006,

so if you enjoyed Mooney most recently on Chappelle Show,

cop this DVD for the low low. Also, if you happen to know

anybody with the 'Race' or 'Masterpiece' CDs, beg for a

copy...they are CLASSIC!

2499097,4,B000E6EK1A,Props to Tim Reid&Paul Mooney on bringing this film to Life. Paul Mooney will crack on you&Blow your sides out. Bro Man  had me rolling&also had me nodding in agreement with alot of the things he said. he just puts it out there for you to think. He ain't afraid of being himself. the Man understands timing&puts it out there for you to digest. Paul Mooney is One of the Most Creative Minds who has ever picked up a Mic&also as a Writer.,1148169600,5,436,4.253012048192771
2499098,5,B000E6EK1A,"Paul Mooney's Analyzing White America is the first readily accessible medium of Mooney's brilliance since the early 90's. With his previous albums R.A.C.E. and Master Piece no longer in production, this is the only place where you can see Mooney's brilliance.

Mooney's not for everyone. His material is sharp, and if you like Bill Hicks, Doug Stanhope, Dave Chappelle, or Chris Rock and are willing (if white) to hear thoughts far away from the mainstream media, then this is the best pickup possible for $10.

Watch it by yourself first, and then look at your social net and see who is capable of handling. For those, this DVD will probably be the best standup they have ever seen or heard.

I wonder what did he think when Snowden proved him right.

His entire act is a racial/political statement and the whole ""Im gonna shock everybody with my racists jokes"" shtick gets old after a while. Maybe Dave wrote all his material on his show. He was funny then, now, not so much. Get some new material Paul.",1397520000,6,375,4.449275362318841

As a white hard-working slave of our economy, I found this stint of so called humor to be racist and offensive.  Don't waste your time on this one.",1396656000,6,308,4.385964912280702
2499141,4,B000E6EK1A,"Very funny.  His comedy is real.  Observations are pretty accurate and makes you think laugh, feel sad, all at the same time.",1395705600,,125,4.636363636363637
2499142,1,B000E6EK1A,"I thought it would be better. It was mildly funny. The quality of the video is reminiscent of a boot leg version of.....well, of anything. Do not expect elaborate sound, lighting or editing techniques because the producers of this piece couldn't afford it ....clearly. Paul Mooney is funny which is why you will likely buy or rent it....but I've seen him much funnier in Chappelle Show sketches.

The content is decent, as previously indicated the quality is poor and if you happen to be of Caucasian decent (I'm African-American myself), then prepare to be dissed and dismissed. I felt mildly uncomfortable for some of the Caucasian audience members in attendance, but Paul Mooney is supposed to be a thought-provoking, challenging and confrontational and unapologetic comedian whose material is racially focused. So basically, you should know what you're opting into and if you don't  that's what these reviews are for.  Just remember, if you are Caucasian, then chances are that you will likely feel uncomfortable some if not most of the time.

This should be a .99 cent rental. The pricing for this offering was not adequately calculated or licensing rights were not negotiated well enough to offer the consumer better pricing options given the production quality and running time.  Point is, you can spend your money on a pack of gum and be just as entertained. You won't be missing anything.",1395705600,3,1397,5.03030303030303
2499143,1,B000E6EK1A,Paul Mooney is witty and racist.  So if you are an anti white racist you will love this hate filled romp.,1395360000,3,105,4.0
2499144,4,B000E6EK1A,I got this with a torn review from before either did not like or love it me being a caucasion person I got it but I have been in among other races and stuff much is true although done in a comedic manner its funny but I could see how someone who is denial may find this offensive,1394236800,,279,3.8275862068965516
2499145,4,B000E6EK1A,Paul Mooney offers social commentary in a humorous format. Hilarious and biting and on the mark. Too truthful for some people.,1393891200,,126,5.0476190476190474

2499159,4,B000E6EK1A,"A lot of what Paul Mooney has to say is really important for white people to hear. I will continue to watch this comedy session to shake myself up.

But the use of the N-word in a comedy context is just something I have a tough time with. I don't think anyone should call anyone else 'n*****', even if the name-caller is a Black man talking to a Black audience. It's my white perspective: there are too many implications created by the dynamic (and white guilt is no longer one of them, by the way).

I don't know if the intent was to wake up people to the racism still alive and well in our society, and in some segments it does seem that Mr. Money is trying to get at something. But at other parts, seems he is just running a comedy show.

Anyway, I welcome more serious content like this that helps keep us aware (especially people like me who grew up prejudiced and still are prejudiced by default) of the attitudes and assumptions we have.",1393027200,,944,4.292134831460674
2499160,5,B000E6EK1A,"This is by far the funniest comedy stand up I've ever seen.  The reviewers claiming that Paul Mooney is being 'racist' obviously have no idea what racist actually means.

2499165,1,B000E6EK1A,Not very funny unless you go through life believing and acting like all white americans are time traveling old dixie plantation owners.

It wasn't that we found it vulgar or insulting - the title gave us enough to know what we were getting into content wise - it simply wasn't funny. We didn't get through more than the first few minutes of it, so maybe it gets better as you go, but I doubt it. The jokes were just low brow and adolescent in our opinion.

2499178,3,B000E6EK1A,"Lots of negative reviews made me think I'd have to suffer through this, but, reluctantly, I didn't.  Sure, some of the pontificating set me off.  Who likes pontificating?

Mooney gasses away, sure. Maybe you like it maybe you don't.  Is that any more or less than is expected from comics who don't shy from social commentary?  If people like Mooney didn't do exactly what we see him do here, would he even have a job?  Or be worth seeing?  And would we, if not for comics daring and even overreaching sometimes, even have something to see?

Mooney is almost always fun.  That's my first and best metric when it comes to judging comics.  I've used it to fail some very funny comedians when they resort to easy racist cliche-mongering, and I'll happily use it to celebrate everyone who really brings the funny, whatever it stirs up.  Mooney's historical(but funny) nonsense about Cleopatra aside, he ties the funny in to real issues worth thinking about.  If you need an attitude adjustment, Mooney's your man.

I take it for granted that everyone is due an attitude adjustment. If you think you never do, you're probably in trouble. Mooney is here to help, and like all true wise men, he makes you laugh. He's flawed?  Yeah, maybe.  On the other hand, maybe he's just going for a laugh.  This show is a mixed batch.  If you want laughs, they're here.  If you want pure truth, some is here, but mixed with other stuff.  Don't expect this show to make you stop thinking by providing final answers or reliable facts.  He's just a comedian after all. But he's lived a while and seen some things.  Expect some questions to be raised, expect some laughs. Take it from there yourself.",1389139200,,1676,4.613559322033899

While he does bother me on exploiting some terms, It is his perspective and valid. I liked this set and enjoyed the side interviews with other people as it gave some perspective to his stage sets.  He is funny, but it comes across to me that Paul Moooney is a bitter guy, and has a reverse racial generalization on the public that is not black. I hope I am wrong, but I couldn't help sensing this. perhaps it is his choice to look for audiences to make them realize, and I can see the positive in this also. There are a lot of apple and orange comparisons when we take a word or description like black, and just because someone is observant and visuals bing prominant, doesn't make one form a negative opinion ... Regardless, very funny guy. I hope he is a happy man.",1381104000,,972,4.164893617021277

2499241,1,B000E6EK1A,Mooney is not funny.  He's about forty years out of touch with today's society.  Dick Gregory did it better in the 60's.  I found this show tedious with recycled cliched liberal spin on what is wrong with White America.  The same criticisms that I have been listening to for decades.  The issues never deal with the pathologies of the liberal policies that perpetuate the problem.  I would never see  a similar  show about Analyzing Black America.

Paul Mooney's biting sarcasm and irreverance has been overlooked by the mainstream American audience, but it is impossible to miss his work if you are a fan of Richard Pryor, In Living Color, and numerous other black comedians from the 70's and 80's, and 90's. Although his rountines are laced with a kind of bitterness, it is easy to see that he has reconciled with his demons, and uses this faux bitterness to address some very serious historic and contemporary issuses.

Funny that when the  joke's on white America, they don't like it so much.

There's a saying--""Throw a stick at a pack of dogs and the ones who run and yelp are the ones fearful of getting hit."" Or more precise, ""If the shoe fits, run from it!""
