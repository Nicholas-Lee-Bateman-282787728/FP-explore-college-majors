Intensity and time are very adecuate.
Works two muscles at the time and burns about 300 calories.
Love it!",1267315200,,158,4.3
2835087,3,B000QAAVQC,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for some exercises for my abs I could do using the exercise band. I didn't find too much of that here, but the use of the band makes some of the ordinary exercises more effective. I do see the potential for quickly toning with the band.",1383868800,,276,4.12962962962963
2835088,4,B000QAAVQC,"I purchased this DVD because I have been trying to do more workouts using resistance bands or tubing.  Firm Fat Burning Cardio Toning use the latter, called a ""resistance cord"" in this workout.  (I believe that this DVD was originally packaged with the cord, but I did not purchase it that way.)  The routine is led by Firm instructor Tina Smalley in a rather bland studio with papered over windows.  There are four background exercisers, one of whom, Allie, modifies some of the exercises.

Tina begins with a fairly typical Firm warm-up that combines aerobic activity with dynamic stretching (note: the band is not used here).  Moves include marches, step-touch, arm circles, hamstring curls, squats, squats with knees and abductions, and rear dips.  The warm-up is somewhat lengthy at 6.5 minutes, but it is relatively fast-paced, so it does start to raise the heart rate.

Picking up the cord and stepping on it with both feet, Tina starts work that would be best described as aerobic toning.  She performs a series which includes squats, biceps curls, back rows, side lunge with one-arm upright row, one-arm chest press, and hamstring work, then repeats the entire series on the second side, finishing with triceps kickbacks.  Next, Tina ups the cardio factor a bit by standing on the band and stepping side-to-side while performing abductions to the side and to the rear.  Holding the band in the hands, she repeats the leg movements while doing arm work such as lat pull downs and chest expanders, adding in lunges as well and then running through the entire sequence a second time.

Now Tina says that it's time to switch to abs work, but first she continues with some additional standing moves.  She starts with the band under one foot for squats with abductions and one-arm overhead press; this is followed by a side lunge with one-arm triceps extension.  With the band under the feet, she performs a standing oblique crunch, and then with the band in the hands overhead, she brings elbow to knee.  Coming down to the mat, Tina begins seated with the band under the feet for rows and half rollbacks, adding a twist.  Next, she performs work on all fours, including straight leg lifts, hamstring curls, and bent leg lifts (band around one foot).

The final 4.5 minutes of this routine are devoted to stretching.  Tina uses the band, starting with a reclined leg stretch.  After doing a prone quad stretch and cat/cow on all fours (no band), she comes to seated and performs several additional stretches with the band to finish.

Overall, I liked this workout.  I thought that Tina used the band effectively and led the routine well.  i was a bit disappointed that there was not more of a cardio focus--with so much time spent with the warm-up and the matwork, the main part of the workout was quite short.  Still, I would recommend this routine, which would work especially well as a travel workout.",1381708800,5,2908,4.806841046277666
2835089,5,B000QAAVQC,"My New Years resolution for 2013 was to get I'm shape & stay that way. I already owned (2) Firm workout DVDs featuring instructor Tina Smalley, the Resistence band one here & the fat burning sculpting ball workout (see my other review of that) also listed on Amazon.

I wanted a good workout that was efficient & fun, that didn't last 100 hours, that's how exercise regimes lose me, sometimes I don't have an hour to hour & a half a day. So the 2 above mentioned Firm workouts fit the bill at 30 minutes. The warm up is perfect but doesn't go through a 1000 motions, the workout portion is hard to beat & the cool down not a moment longer than needed.

The DVDs come with the accessories you need, in this case the Resistence cord & the other a sculpting ball. The colors of cords reflect different strengths, going from pink, green to purple starting lowest to highest. I started the 2nd of January doing the sculpting ball workout & after a few weeks thought I'd mix it up with the Resistence band one. I hated it then. I didn't feel it was a very good workout at the time so I shelved it, went back to just sculpting ball & after another month I added ankle & arm weights to that.

A few weeks in mastering this I tried the Resistence band workout again. Now I LOVE IT. The problem? I wasn't strong enough to do the Resistence band one effectively, I have the green cord, medium strength. But after a few months of the sculpting ball workout with ankle & hand weights I can do the Resistence band no problem. It really does work the whole body & you'll see quick results.

I'm always shocked when I look in the mirror & cannot wait for bikini weather! Though I should say that I wasn't over weight, I was already a size 4-6 but had no muscle tone. My advice is start this video after you've been doing a program for a few months, that way you'll be able to do it, otherwise you'll get discouraged & quit. This is an excellent DVD for people who want to get in shape that don't have a ton of time.",1363564800,3,1999,4.225130890052356
2835090,5,B000QAAVQC,"This is a great DVD for traveling because all you need is a resistance band.  I also use it at home, because it offers a good low-impact cardio and toning workout.  It is only 30 minutes long. If your goal is to lose a lot of weight, this is probably not the DVD for you, since it is not high intensity. But for maintaing a healthy weight and tone up muscles,  this DVD is fun and effective.",1362268800,3,391,4.0519480519480515
2835091,5,B000QAAVQC,actually I was surprised at how well I liked this one. I am used to working out with weights so switching over to using a cord I thought would be a breeze. haha! It is as hard or as light as you make it depending on how much you tighten up your grip on cord. It does work your entire body in a half hour! Some days I just don't have the time for a longer workout or just don't want to work out and this all over total body dvd does the trick. Tina gives decent cues and had no problem with following her.  I highly recommend.,1347580800,3,525,3.861111111111111
2835092,5,B000QAAVQC,"I like exercising with gadgets and this DVD was lots of fun and just the right length at 30 minutes.
I also enjoy this instructor and use her weighted ball workout.",1333065600,,164,4.32258064516129
2835093,4,B000QAAVQC,"I was looking for a workout to follow while using a set of resistance cords.  This one is quick, easy to follow and efficient at working out most muscle groups.",1324080000,,160,4.333333333333333
2835094,5,B000QAAVQC,"First of all I have to say I am not overweight in any way (I am 30 years old, 5'6"" and 115 pounds), the reason I started using the video was because I wanted to get some muscle tone and get rid of what looked like the very early stage of a muffin top.
The videos were a casual gift from my mother in law (not in a mean way, i promise)once We were cleaning her garage, she found the box NEW, never opened and She didn't want to even try so I guess you can say I Inherited them...that was 2009. So finally 2 weeks ago I decided to open it...not very sure If I would like them (I hate any type of fitness videos, gyms etc)
SO...
First 10 mins you warm up and learn the moves, next 10 mins you really do some cardio and then last 10 mins you do crunches and stretch in the end. The resistance created by the band makes you feel the exercise really good.

I found that those 30 mins were enough to tone your muscles, use muscles that probably you never used in a work out before, enough time to kept your heart going in a very healthy way and also feel good after exercising..not feel like you are about to pass out like in some other videos like the ""insanity"" one.

I am not weighting myself because I don't care about my weight but about my looks and tone. I have done 8 workouts (they claim you see results in 10) so far and I totally notice the difference. I also have to add that I go hiking once a week for 2 hrs so I am sure that's also helping.
I am a health care worker so from the cardio perspective I am very pleased with this product. From the fitness perspective and I am happy too, i feel better and look better. I would recommend this product.",1296777600,12,1654,4.009090909090909
2835095,5,B000QAAVQC,"I got this on sale thinking it would be a good backup workout when I can't get to the gym.  The package guarantees visible results after 10 workouts, but I've noticed visible results after just 3 workouts.  There is no downtime, and lots of resistance work with the FIRM cord.  The only thing that could be better is that my video came with just one cord and sometimes it is just the right resistance and other times it is too much.  I can get another lower resisntance cord, though, so it's a minor issue.  I'm very pleased with this video and would recommend it to anyone who is low on tone and would like to see their muscles firm up quickly.",1293321600,6,645,4.297520661157025

8195264,5,B000QAAVQC,I can't believe how well the resistance bands work your muscles.  I go to the gym and perform my machine weights and have to up my game because the bands have made me so much stronger.,1453593600,,184,4.111111111111111
8195265,5,B000QAAVQC,"I've been using The Firm tapes for 30 years. I'm a fan. This 30-minute workout is just as other reviewers have stated. Challenging and sweat producing. Tara cues moves very well. I am familiar with The Firm moves so it was easy for me to follow. The routine is effective even if you don't want to invest in the 5 lb ball. I used a 5 lb free weight. The only part of the routine where you might miss it is for squeezing the ball between your knees for for the bridge exercise. However, you can squeeze a small rubber ball between you knees and place the 5-lb weight(s) on your hips for a bigger challenge, or not use a ball at all. Very good 30-minute routine. I highly recommended this as an addition to any workout collection.",1433635200,2,727,4.27536231884058

8195268,5,B000QAAVQC,"LOVE this DVD!  30 minutes of kick your butt cardio and strength training total body workout.  I'm so happy with this one, I ordered The Firm Stability Ball workout DVD.  Can't wait to get it - I'm sure I'll do one after the other and feel very satisfied that I got a double duty heck of a workout.  This one by itself is fantastic!  I have a library of workout DVDs and this in my top 5 favorites.  I highly recommend it.",1411257600,,422,4.085365853658536

8195270,5,B000QAAVQC,this video is amazing. I tried many things to lose weight and nothing works; only this video does. get it,1402617600,,105,4.3
8195271,3,B000QAAVQC,I found it difficult to keep up with the exercises.  Maybe with more patience and practice it will become easier.,1400544000,,113,4.65
8195272,5,B000QAAVQC,I have to say I really like this one. I am a lazy bag and I'm the type of person that wants to lose weight but doesn't want to do much for it if I don't have to (honesty is the best policy!) I purchased this about 4 years ago and probably didn't use it until 2 years ago when I started to do the workout every day or at least 4 times a week. I already liked it then and felt really good after I did it. I just started doing it again a couple of days ago and I feel so great. Haven't seen results yet but it's too early to tell. I have to take breaks in between to drink something and catch my breath (I am a beginner after all) but this is really great. I would absolutely recommend this and can't wait to compare my before and after pictures! :-),1390348800,,747,3.825806451612903
