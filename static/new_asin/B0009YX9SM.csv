2343523,1,B0009YX9SM,Awful movie!  The acting in this movie is very poor and unprofessional.  I stopped watching after a few minutes.  Definitely would not buy it.,1388534400,,142,4.833333333333333
2343524,3,B0009YX9SM,If you are looking for a lot of T&A then this is a good late night movie for you.  Plot is not very good but if you are just looking for an older movie with a lot of T&A then this is the movie for you.  Acting was bad but the girls were good looking and kept me going for the entire movie.,1387670400,,289,3.5714285714285716
2343525,2,B0009YX9SM,"I mean, what do you say about a film that plays creepy porn lounge music behind a forced shower scene as if to say ""Forget about the forced labor and sexual abuse, These enslaved women are sexy when they shower"". Creepy, seriously creepy.",1387670400,,238,4.558139534883721
2343526,2,B0009YX9SM,"SAVAGE ISLAND begins w/ a woman, submerged in mud / quicksand (quick-mud?), being killed by a large snake. The scene switches to a woman named Daly (Linda Blair) walking into a high-rise, pulling a gun, and shooting a security guard (Penn Gillette!!) in the forehead! Daly's there to tell her former employer about her mistreatment at the hands of his jungle thugs. Of course, this is done using flashbacks of events having nothing to do w/ Daly. The ""story"" has something to do w/ emeralds, and those profiting from them. However, it's mostly scenes of sweaty women fighting, sweaty men murdering each other, and more sweaty women losing their clothes while fighting. This is punctuated by the occasional narration of Ms. Blair, reminding us that this monotonous mess is supposed to make some sort of sense. Not even the near-constant barrage of full-frontal female nudity can help to ease the agony of this dog-log! Whew!...",1387584000,,926,4.980645161290322
2343527,2,B0009YX9SM,Tired plot. Phoney action. Basically just a soft porn film. Linda Blair does show a lot of skin but most people ave seen it before in better movies.,1386460800,4,148,4.321428571428571
2343528,2,B0009YX9SM,"I decided to give this flik a try after hearing Charles Band of Full Moon Pictures describe its' genesis in the rap he gives as part of the extras in all of the newly re-issued ""Grindhouse Collection"" from Full Moon. At a point in the past Band apparently found a bunch of sleazy WIP style foreign made films and purchased the rights to them... then re-packaged one of them (as ""Savage Island') with a wrap-around story line featuring Linda Blair - in order to give the film a bit of Hollywood Star Power draw for the domestic market.

Personally, altho I'm as big a fan of Linda's work as any, I was more drawn to the film by the promise of some good hard WIP action such as foreign directors (like Jess Franco) can sometimes deliver.  Unfortunately, the product provided by the Full Moon ""Savage Island"" package is flawed by a very poor transfer which renders the viewing experience sub-par. As other reviewers have noted - this is particularly annoying during any dark night-time scenes - which are virtually un-viewable -  as well as hindering a full appreciation of the many scenes of naked female flesh - that are likely what one would purchase this product to enjoy in the first place.

But, for any die-hard WIP fans who wished that they could actually SEE what is contained in this twisted little flik - please be aware that there is a MUCH BETTER VERSION available.  A little probing around on the internet provided the additional info that this film (in its' original release) was actually an Italian effort (filmed in South America) entitled ""Hotel Paradis(e)"" (and apparently shot 'back-to-back with a similar film entitled: ""Escape From Hell"").  This original (widescreen!) version of the film is available with a MUCH better picture quality from: Amazon.co.uk (Britain). Sold as: ""Hotel Paradis - the Strong Uncut Version"" this is a Swedish release (w/ dubbed English sound). The Euro-disk actually contains 2 separate versions of the film - the 'theatrical' release and a version re-assembled from multiple sources - that provides 'inserts' of 'deleted' hardcore XXX scenes that 'extend' several of the sex scenes portrayed in the film.  These 'hardcore' scenes are relatively visually degenerated when compared to the rest of the film's sharp visual quality, but they are (ironically) about as ' clear(NOT)' as the quality of ALL of the Full Moon 'Savage Island' version! While the X rated material adds little to the story-line it IS nice to have the option to view it - AND - there IS one scene involving 'a pipe' that takes on a special nuance when viewed in the hard-core context! Of course there's no Linda Blair in the 'original' movie - AND - the Euro-Region 2 PAL DVD requires a 'region-free' player to view! - something that every mondo-weirdo movie fanatic should invest in!

The Euro-version of this nasty little piece of jungle based sexploitation does deliver the goods that WIP hounds hope to find. Ample female nudity throughout - plenty of sex - a 'classic' 2 girls tied together whipping scene, and lotsa 'showers'. The primary female leads are plenty attractive! - Eurasian hottie Christina Lai gets pretty 'explicit'- as does the impressive Ajita Wilson - baring all - she's arguably the hottest female of the bunch even though 'she' was apparently originally a MAN - letz hear it for modern medicine!  For the ""Euro ""Hotel Paradis"" version - 4.5 stars!

I'm generally 'liking' the new crop of 'Grindhouse"" product that Full Moon has been releasing, but the picture quality, and content, IS pretty variable from feature to feature.  In the case of ""Savage Island"" the image quality is poor and really detracts from the over-all enjoyment - so, despite the fact that it is packed full of all the good stuff that one looks for in this type of flik, I can't give the Full Moon version more than an 'average' grade.",1384732800,15,3847,4.831306990881459
2343529,1,B0009YX9SM,"I thought this dvd had linda blair in it, like red heat.  She is edited in the beginning and end of another film.

2343530,2,B0009YX9SM,"The poster looks awesome! Like the howl movie is a Pam Grier ""Women In Cages"" movie with Linda Blair playing Pam Grier... Not so. I'm a huge Linda Blair fan, so huge I'd watch anything she was in! But this movie does not qualify.

Here's what happened: It's 1985, the Director of this movie gets the distribution rights to some really bad Mexican ""Woman in Cages"" movies, so bad that not even a die hard lover of the genre would be interested in seeing them, so he pieces a few of these movies together to tell a story: A big diamond syndicate in Las Vegas runs black market jewel mining operations with women slaves in tropical Mexico doing the digging. But one woman (Linda Blair) had escaped, tracked down the big boss man, and holds him at gunpoint recounting her story. (Linda Blair does some narration throughout the film.) The director tells the story in a bonus feature on the DVD that the Linda Blair sequence would only require one day of filming and they could afford a good actress, so they got Linda Blair.

Video Quality: The movies in this series come from two (2) sources depending on what tittle you get. In some cases a 35mm print, in others a VHS. This tittle falls into the latter category. I have seen higher quality VHS rips on YouTube.

There is also animal violence in the film.

So, if you find this DVD for $1.00, go ahead and get it if you want to say you've seen it. But for anything more than that, you're being ripped off. And please understand I'm a HUGE Grindhouse fan! But the Full Moon Grindhouse Collection does not seem to deliver. Though Auditions looks kind of good.

Happy Viewing!",1376352000,13,1620,4.477966101694915

2343532,3,B0009YX9SM,"This is a fairly hard movie to find, and was only looking for it as a hardcore Blair fan. Blair is barely even in the movie: just a few minutes at the beginning and a few at the end. A inadvertently humorous exploitation flick using the women in prison/women in chains motif. Was wondering why this hadn't been updated to dvd and is only available on vhs. Well, perhaps because it's, mmmmm..........not so good.",1171497600,5,411,4.5675675675675675

2343534,1,B0009YX9SM,"A truly awful hodgepodge of frequently unrelated film pieced together with Linda Blair's name to draw unwary audiences.  Picture quality is inconsistent.  The tone for this turkey is set at the beginning with a blury picture of a woman buried up to her shoulders.  For no apparent reason a snake, a constrictor of some type, leaves a tree, glides across the clearing to the woman and wraps itself around her neck, killing her.  Too bad it didn't strangle the people responsible for foisting this thing off on the public.  If your only interest is to see nude women, there is a lot of boring, nonsensical film to suffer through in order to enjoy that dubious thrill.  Maybe if you turn the sound off and use fast forward a lot.

I downloaded this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1469145600,3,801,4.559440559440559

2343793,4,B0009YX9SM,"A spoiler for the first scene of this movie;

A woman is buried to her neck in the ground. We see shots of a juvenile Burmese python and hear a discordantly ominous soundtrack. We see shots of distressed women in cages and then hear off-camera screaming.  We see a shot of the Burmese python wrapped around the head of the woman in the ground and a then a shot of the python moving away, the woman in the ground is now apparently dead.

The next scene features a young Linda Blair and Penn (of Penn and Teller). I won't spoil the second act, except that it is revealed that the prison camp is in South America. Which left me wondering how a snake from Southeast Asia made it to South America and why that snake would expend the energy to kill something far too large for it eat?

My favorite part was when a named character was killed two different times during this movie. Literally she is killed about half way through and then again at the end. Just a quality film overall. Also the constant sounds of someone yelling ""WOORRRKKKK"" during any scenes where they're supposed to be digging up gems is pretty entertaining as well.

Skipped through it...fast..and couldn't finish it.  Life's too short.  Bad is too good of a rating thus my worse-than-awful title.  Filmed in some banana republic with English voice overs, terrible acting, worse film quality  (and that's saying something considering how terrible the acting is) - not to mention the incredibly inane plot, I couldn't come close to finishing it.

2343874,1,B0009YX9SM,"The whole movie was a platform for showing naked or partially naked women, sometimes being pawed at by men or fighting with other naked or partially naked women.

The acting was poor, the plot line was poorer.

On the plus side, some of the women were pretty.  Unfortunately, that's not enough of a plus for me.",1389398400,,311,4.517857142857143

8070661,1,B0009YX9SM,"DO NOT BUY!!! 2 movies spliced together! One of which I already owned! If you've seen the old 'women in prison genre' film ""Escape from hell"" (a late 70's/early 80's Italian film) then you've seen this too. The differences; approximately 7 minutes of Linda Blair holding a fat man hostage in a office...and approximately 15 minutes of a similar storyline spliced in. But here's the kicker; the footage spliced in is the same actors playing a different part! It's hysterical!!! If you've seen escape from hell (like I have) you will be nothing but confused! It's asinine! Indescribably asinine!!! Even if I didn't already own this film (under a different title) it's still awful, and not in a good way...70's 'B' movie fans know what I'm talkin about. There's GOOD bad, and then BAD bad. It's not even worth a $0.99 cent rental. I paid $12 & change...do not buy!!!",1488412800,3,863,4.76
