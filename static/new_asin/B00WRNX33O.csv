7150006,5,B00WRNX33O,Definitely a neat little fix for 90's Nickelodeon Game Show fans! Hope we get more of these kinds of sets in the future!,1430438400,3,120,4.260869565217392
7150007,5,B00WRNX33O,"This DVD, while not as great season sets would be, are a great start and fantastic if you're a game show fan! Episodes are as follows:

Legends: Golden Cricket Cage of Khan
Legends: Jewel Encrusted Egg of Catherine the Great
GUTS: A.J. vs. Amanda vs. Jamie
GUTS: Nikki vs. Tony vs. Robert
Figure it Out (Family Style): Aaron Carter/Kenan Thomspon/Danny Tamberelli/Lori Beth Denberg
Family Double Dare: Kandy Kanes vs. The Holders
SSDD (1987): Gabrielle and Dave vs. Carrie and Matt
Nick Arcade: Joseph and Danielle vs. Charles and Keri

The quality is great; probably the best we'll ever see of these shows. The only ""quality"" related problem I came across is that the switch/return to commercials on ""Cricket Cage of Khan"" are slightly cut for some reason, unlike the release on iTunes (But that's just me being nitpicky). The big downside is that this is only a 8 episodes out of many. So Nick, if you're reading this - please release more game shows!",1430352000,24,953,4.804878048780488

7150079,3,B00WRNX33O,"I bought this, because pretty much like everyone else, these shows bring back so many great memories from my childhood. However, I am highly disappointed in the fact that there are only 8 episodes in total on this one disc. There are 2 episodes of Legends, 2 of Double Dare, 2 Guts, and 1 each of Figure it Out and Nick Arcade. I really can't understand why there were only 8 episodes. Nick could be making more money if they just release these old shows to dvd/Blu-ray.

7150083,5,B00WRNX33O,"This is the best collection ever. I wish Nickelodeon would put out even MORE of these amazing old Nickelodeon kids game shows on MOD DVD, and especially Wild and Crazy Kids (which was a childhood favorite of mine). Maybe also this could be the time to clean up those old VHS masters and rerelease Double Dare: The Inside Scoop, Double Dare: The Messiest Moments, Double Dare Super Sloppiest Moments and Nickelodeon GUTS All-Star Special (that could also include the full original perfect score runs now) onto MOD DVD. Is the content included in this set perfect? Well... for a taste of what awesomeness is to come if Nickelodeon is SMART about it, yes. As a standalone single release collection, it could be better. For one, there's not many original Double Dare episodes, it's just what's been released digitally on iTunes, etc so far... I would absolutely love to have more of everything. I bought this last year to speak with my dollars and I would love to do more of that, Nick.",1480809600,,982,4.715116279069767
7150084,5,B00WRNX33O,"I found this disc by accident and ordered it straight away. The minute I put it in the player, I was transported back to the days of boom boxes, Space Camp, and being scared to death by guys in Mayan masks. Legends of the Hidden Temple was the corner stone of my childhood. Every playground was the Temple and the two episodes here were a welcome blast from the past. Here's hoping we see more released, maybe as bonus features when they put that great movie adaptation on DVD. Purple Parrots, do or die!",1480377600,,504,4.372340425531915

I just wish it had a few more episodes but it was a good mix. I like that there is an option to just play everything and you don't have to pick which show you want to watch, this was good for playing in the background during the party.",1467244800,2,367,3.779220779220779

7150145,5,B00WRNX33O,"Awesome, notalgia-ey goodness at it's best!!! If you're a kid from the 90's & watched Nickelodeon (what kid didn't?), you should totally buy this DVD! I personally would've preferred another episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple or even GUTS over two episodes of Double Dare & I didn't remember Nick Arcade all that much at first but overall a great single disc collection!",1449187200,,375,4.875
7150206,5,B00WRNX33O,"Eight episodes of six classic Nick game shows are on DVD for the very first time, albeit DVD-R, or even DVD+R if you have a Blu-ray player that can tell the difference between -R and +R DVDs, since mine was a DVD+R copy somehow, as with the series set of Chalkzone that I've got. But it still plays every show just fine, right down to modern Nick jingles playing before all 8 of them! Nick game shows are always a thrill for us who grew up with them; too bad TeenNick's 90's block, now renamed The Splat, is only limited to a few Nicktoons on a regular basis as of November 2015 (Hey Arnold, Rugrats, CatDog, The Angry Beavers, Rocko's Modern Life, Rocket Power, and even All Grown Up). If you don't want to go through mini-marathons of Rugrats starting the Splat and repeating at the end of it, we should get on TeenNick's butt to put on Nick's live-action shows from the 90's, especially these game shows! At any rate, you never know how the players of these shows will win or lose, or what they'd win, even if they were revised prizes sometimes, such as The Mighty Ducks' First Face-Off 1997 VHS for a 1993 episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple, since the prizes are normally hard to find now, in 2015, but the vacations aren't so hard to find, unless they've been closed years ago. With this disc, Super Sloppy Double Dare is by far THE oldest Nick show on DVD as of Christmas 2015, even bypassing Hey Dude from Shout Factory, since its one episode in here is from 1987! You're in for an exciting treat with this time capsule of Nick game shows from the 90's (and the 80's)! This review was NOT made before a live audience at Nickelodeon Studios, at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, but all these shows were, as nearly all their end credits point out. Help support these game shows, and get this disc if you want to; that way Amazon can make more of them!",1444694400,2,1867,4.38328530259366
7150207,5,B00WRNX33O,Please put out more of these on DVD! These are the game shows of my childhood. This was like seeing an old friend again. I'd almost forgotten how terrifying those temple guards were. I LOVE this and I need MORE!,1444348800,,211,4.3

7150209,5,B00WRNX33O,"It would be pretty cool if Nickelodeon could one day release actual DVD sets of each show along with brand new bonus features, but this is sort of a test run to see if Nickelodeon would be willing to do that in the future. In order for them to do it these DVD must sell, Please order this DVD show your support. Tell Nick you want to see these shows on DVD.",1440979200,2,357,3.9722222222222223

7150211,4,B00WRNX33O,"We definitely bought this in hopes to encourage Nick to put Legends of the Hidden Temple, Double Dare, and Guts on DVD as seasons. It's a pretty solid mix. I never cared for Nick Arcade, so we skipped over that. But Legends and DD are worth the buy.",1438300800,,249,4.208333333333333
7150212,4,B00WRNX33O,"I'm not a huge Nickelodeon fan, but I did like a few of its shows (these game shows, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Power Rangers Megaforce, and Rocko's Modern Life).  The game shows were the real treat as they were all original and added some much needed excitement after school.  This DVD has 8 episodes from the six shows (well one of each save for Guts and Legends of the Hidden Temple which have two and for good reason).  Here are the episodes:

Legends of the Hidden Temple -
The Golden Cricket Cage of Khan and the Jewel Encrusted Egg of Catherine the Great
My personal favorite of them all and I'm glad they did 2 instead of one.  My favorite team was the Blue Barracudas, but I didn't really care who made it to the temple.  The problem here is, why did they choose the episode with the most embarrassing temple run in the history of the show (the Cricket Cage episode)?  I'll never figure that one out, I could have had my very first episode (and favorite!), The Lucky Pillow of Annie Taylor, which had the luckiest temple run ever.  Oh well, at least the second episode makes up for that loss since it's a victory and maybe they wanted to show a loss.

GUTS
AJ ""Mean"" Mclean/Amanda ""The Accelerator/Jaime ""The Jackal""
""Nervy"" Nikki/Tony ""The Tiger""/Robert ""The Bull""
My second favorite game show, like a kids Olympic competition with plenty of events!  The first episode features future Backstreet Boy AJ Mclean, doing the best he can (I won't reveal the outcome).  The second was a good one too, though I would have liked it if it was one from the Global season where there were players from 8 different countries (USA, Israel, Mexico, Portugal, UK, Germany, Spain, and the former Commonwealth of Independent States).

Nick Arcade
This would be my third favorite since it involves video games, features future N*SYNC member Joey Fatone as a contestant.

Family Double Dare
Kandy Kanes vs Holders
Same silly, sloppy fun as it was two decades ago with all sorts of wacky games

Super Sloppy Double Dare
More of the same, but I think I prefer the Family version better...

Figure it Out Family Style
Featuring Kenan of Kenan and Kel in a Family Feud style game.  I didn't fully appreciate this one as the other ones though...

One of the cool things about this package is they included the prizes for the contestants who didn't get far (even though those products are dated).  Overall, this is a good purchase for those who grew up in the 90's with these game shows.  Perhaps we'll see more of these in the future...",1437264000,5,2524,4.568888888888889
7150213,5,B00WRNX33O,"Talk about a flashback to Nickelodeon in the 90s. I loved so many of these shows as a kid. Nickelodeon was all about kid friendly programming and when it came to game shows (Double Dare and Figure It Out in particular) was all about getting messy in the spirit of competition. Some of these later shows became part of the Nick GAS (Games and Sports) block. It would have been nice to get shows like ""{Wild and Crazy Kids"" attached to this set. I also wish that some of these shows would get individual DVD releases this is still a few good nostalgic gems for a cheap price.

Legends of the Hidden Temple (2 episodes)
Guts (2 Episodes)
Figure It Out (1 episode)
