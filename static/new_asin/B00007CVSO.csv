1806122,4,B00007CVSO,"It was the beginning, after so many years of degraded parts and smiling, minstrial-type characters, the 70's brought us new hope and new faces on the screen that we could identify with.  Sweet, sweet-back, Superfly, Shaft, and The Mack brought true-to life characters that were what we wanted to be; they were the ones who got away with what none of us could.

This incredible era is depected in this magnificent film, which shows, how, who, and why these films were made and just as quickly faded away.  A must have for anyone who was around at that time.",1285545600,,556,4.595959595959596
1806123,5,B00007CVSO,"Personally, I found no fault with this DVD. I think that all of the major issues about these films were well covered and discussed. Actress Gloria Hendry, director William Cohen, and the no-introdution needed Pam Grier's interviews were quite revealing about how these films affected the careers of those who worked in them. The controversy with the NAACP and Jesse jackson and their opposition to this films is well-handled to give both sides of this issue and it all allows the viewer to make up their own minds. Well done.",1182124800,,525,4.844444444444444
1806124,3,B00007CVSO,"this is the kind of Dvd I was excited about because I love the films during that time period alot.there was so much going on that isn't fully told on this disc.you need 2-3 discs to tell the whole story&even then you are bound to leave something out because there was so many other details that  came into play.these Films saved Hollywood back then until the BlockBuster films like Jaws,Star wars,etc... came along. Many actors&actress's from these films didn't get a fair shot in other films.the Cosmetic 80's downplayed this era as well.but thanks to the Hip-Hop Movement these films&Creative forces got a Bigger lift than ever.so many Great Talents that haven't gotten there full due to this day.",1085961600,,699,4.873949579831932
1806125,5,B00007CVSO,"""BaadAsssss Cinema"" is not your usual dry, academic documentary. While the arrangement of material seems pretty random and scattershot, the clips are priceless as historical artifacts of the times and the prevailing social attitudes. The debate as to the potential racist tracts implicit and explicit in the movies is wisely avoided, and the importance of black visibility of any kind supersedes any moral judgment here. The place of blaxploitation films of this periodin the overall history of Hollywood is examined very closely, with surprising results. If we are to believe it, these films saved Hollywood studios in the '70s --- only to have the studios themselves turn their back on black artists a decade later. However, political and financial debates about art only get in the way. What we really have here is a delicious compendium of scenes and interviews from one of America's most beloved cult genres. Pam Grier, the greatest Black Mamma of them all, is fascinating as she discusses the beginnings of her prodigious career. Melvin Van Peebles, one of the few black artists to retain complete control of his films, discusses his seminal ""Sweet Sweetback's BaadAsssss Song,"" arguably the first film in the genre. Isaac Hayes, composer and actor and ""South Park"" scion, talks about the groovy music essential for these movies. Richard Roundtree, Gloria Hendry and Fred Williamson all discuss the trials and triumphs of black performers creating, for the first time, a complete black identity on film. Quentin Tarantino,looking strangely pale, displays his goofy charm as he waxes rhapsodic about his first experience as a child attending his first black exploit film. These movies have been called the original guilty pleasure, and they are all enormously fun. This documentary shows a great cross-section of the movies and the artists, retaining all of the energy, action, comedy and sex we associate with these movies. Although it may be less fun yelling back at your television set alone than being part of a crowd on a Saturday night, Superfly, Shaft and all them guys (and their gals) still pack a wallop.

7975200,3,B00007CVSO,"BaadAsssss Cinema is an hour-long documentary film, directed by Isaac Julien, that looks at the Blaxploitation era of the 1970s.

With archive film clips and interviews, this brief look at a frequently overlooked historical period of filmmaking acts as an introduction rather than a complete record. It features interviews with some of the genre's biggest stars, such as Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, and Richard Roundtree. Director Melvin Van Peebles discusses the historical importance of his landmark film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. For a contemporary perspective, the hyper Quentin Tarantino offers his spirited commentary and author/critic bell hooks provides some scholarly social analysis.

The music of Blaxploitation films is discussed, focusing on Curtis Mayfield's Super Fly and Isaac Hayes' Shaft. Interviews with writer/director Larry Cohen and film historian Armond White are also featured. BaadAsssss Cinema was originally shown on the Independent Film Channel in August 2002 as part of a week-long Blaxploitation film festival.",1385769600,,1049,5.849673202614379
