7022291,4,B00TRUJ6RC,"The storyline is fantasic. My daughter loves it. The only complaint I have is the volume quality. The voices do sound like they are coming from a cave a little. It hasn't detered my daughter from watching but she did notice it. I contacted Amazon and I had them send a replacement thinking it was maybe a bad video, However the new on is the same so it's just the sound quality. Like I said, the storyline is fantastic and the visual quality is totally fine too. I'm hoping they will releases newer episodes soon and just tweek the one thing. I'd still recommend but just know that's there.",1433548800,3,590,4.422018348623853

Talking to Unicorns
Mia glumly arrives at a strange new boarding school where she immediately clashes with the popular girls. But shes been given an amazing gift: a final birthday present from her father that draws her into a beautiful fantasy world called Centopia. Transformed into an elf, Mia makes friends with unicorn Lyria and the elven Prince Mo and his companion Yuko  only after she discovers that she possesses a unique skill. However, when she clashes with the ruthless general Gargona and her unicorn-hunting army, she soon finds this world is no less difficult or dangerous than the one she left behind.

Centopias Hope
Teased by Violetta for an embarrassing athletic performance, Mia yearns to retreat from school to the more idyllic land of Centopia. But this time, she has to solve a riddle to figure out the password. Vincent, a fellow outsider, gives Mia the help she needs, but nearly discovers her secret. In Centopia, Mia discovers Phuddles dissonant Trumptus is more than meets the ear. Thanks to her help, the elves have a new reason to be hopeful.

Restoration (Saving Centopia)
An upcoming math test and the worry of bumping into Violetta have Mia on the run from her real-life problems. Providing her with a place to hide, Vincent lets Mia in on a secret of his own  but she still isn't ready to share the truth about herself. In Centopia, Mia tries to help a befuddled Phuddle: hes taken apart the Trumptus, and cant find his original blueprints to reassemble it! Theyll have to figure it out before its too late for all of Centopia.
