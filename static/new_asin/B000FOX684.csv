8534393,5,B000FOX684,I would have to say out of all the concerts of his that I have seen. This is my favorite. All of his concerts are awesome but this one ranks the best. You can easily tell he and everyone who worked on it puts everything they have into it. It was a amazing concerts. If you buy you won't be disappeared. He puts so much of himself into this or all of his concerts which you rarely see anymore and you can tell they all enjoyed doing it. I so wished I had been able to have seen this concert live. Such rotten luck! XD,1316390400,,516,3.9238095238095236
