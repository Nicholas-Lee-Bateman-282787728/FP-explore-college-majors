5275559,5,B009762D1C,I knew about this but didn't know the extent of the story. Another great documentary by ESPN Film 30 for 30.,1362268800,,108,4.190476190476191
8537151,5,B009762D1C,This is one of the best 30 for 30's that ESPN has made. It is a forgotten story between Dennis Johnson and Carl Lewis. Very well done.....and after watching this I think that Carl Lewis cheated as well. There is alot to take in with this documentary but I recommend that if you are a sports fan to watch this! Its damn good!,1527811200,,324,4.158730158730159
8537152,4,B009762D1C,"Some of the 30 for 30 series are great others are just kind of ok.  I was skeptical about watching this one but I am glad I did.  I learned a lot more about the other participants in that 1988 Summer Olympic 100 meter final.  All the blame was put on Ben Johnson as the villain but actually the majority of those sprinters were later caught cheating 6 of the 8 participants.  This race was the benchmark incident of steroid use creeping into the fabric of sports itself.  Ben Johnson & Jose Canseco are still seen at the poster children for steroid use in sports.  Before Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Marion Jones and Lance Armstrong.

The documentary does a great job putting doubt in the minds of if Carl Lewis was a clean athlete.  He had all the endorsements and funding in the world.  Ben Johnson did have an ego which definitely led to his downfall but he is not a bad human being.  He was a world class sprinter that had a ton of talent just not the overall speed to be the best in the world.  After seeing the Eastern Europeans doping for years and not getting caught and feeling like the rest of the field is also using steroids created an unfair playing field.  He also suspected his competitors of outright doping and he was right.

I always wondered how Ben got caught so quickly almost as if he was expecting it or trying to be caught.  Like the Tour De France with Lance Armstrong I feel horrible for the guys who came in 2nd and 3rd in all those titles he won, but who knows if they were doping as well.  Could the real Tour De France winner every year be the guy who comes in 16th or 17th place without all the glory yellow shirt and champagne no chance to stand on the podium, cheered by thousands of people, no big Publishers clearing house price check for 1st place and trophy.  The same can be said in almost every Olympic track and field event.

Ben does seem remorseful in the film, he knows he made a mistake and the dark cloud seems to still be hovering over his head.  I actually garnered a lot more sympathy for him than I did for Carl Lewis.  It definitely put a lot more suspicion on him as well.  I agree with a lot of other reviewers that none of these guys in the race were really likable.  But if you put yourself in their shoes this is the biggest moment of their lives, they each spent thousands of hours and years of training to get to that point with or without drugs.

I really enjoyed how the directly interviewed all 8 finalists in the race so you get several different points of view.  This was an extraordinary group of men in this field one of the best groups ever.  What really brought home the temptation for these athletes was the female Canadian sprinter who after years of trying and finally succeeding and making it to the Olympics she could not get by the Eastern European sprinters which were known to all be using steroids and doping in some manner.  She is the best person in this story in my opinion.  I valued her insight although her name escapes me right now.  I do not blame her and admire her testimony in front of a grand jury which stripped her of all her accomplishments.

Overall the film is very intriguing I would rate it 4 1/2 stars. It does not have a mega happy ending.  Steroids in professional sports are now large part a reality.  Like college football ""If you ain't cheatin you ain't trying mentality.""  Good sportsmanship went away a long time ago in the face of widespread fortune and fame.  9.79* is definitely a great episode in the series to watch.",1461888000,,3523,4.339449541284404
8537153,5,B009762D1C,Best of the 30 for 30's IMO.,1453075200,,28,3.142857142857143
8537154,1,B009762D1C,"Carl Lewis cheated and remains the shame of Willingboro, NJ.

Track and Field has been among the dirtiest sports for decades, thanks to PEDs. Who cares about the achievements of the participants? It's just not possible to be in the forefront in any Olympic or World Championships race without taking something. Breaking world records constantly every year is just not possible without drugs. What Usain Bolt did in two Olympics is still laughable to this day. It's obvious that he is taking bunch of drugs; he is just good, thanks to his team of doctors, at not getting caught.

So, do yourself a favor: don't watch or attend these farcical events; you are just being suckered. The same goes for all sports. Those who say that it's a level playing field: then Ben Johnson actually won the race in 1988.

As for the documentary 30 for 30: 9.79, it's a big waste of time; everybody is obviously lying except for Ben Johnson, Calvin Smith, and Robson da Silva. All in all, King Carl is the Great Closet Homosexual Cheat.",1425945600,,1017,4.670391061452514
8537155,5,B009762D1C,"I love documentaries!  I watch stories that I have no knowledge about and ones that I feel that I know quite a bit about.  In this case, I felt like I knew quite a bit about the race because of the two gentlemen in the forefront of the cover, Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis.  After watching this film, it's obvious that I only knew a small amount in the entire picture.

It's important to know that this film goes back to a time where there was still some innocence in performance.  Some may call this Summer Olympics the turning point in performance enhancing drugs and how the public views them.

The race itself is spectacular.  Although the 9.79 mark has been broken a dozen or more times since 1988, the race in this film remains a great one, if not shocking.  Track and field enthusiasts will gravitate to it automatically.  Others that will gain something from this are conspiracy theorists and sports lovers.  In my opinion, schools should also show it to their students.  It's world history, physical education, and law all wrapped into one package.

It's also important to note that the ""DVD-R"" copy of this film is really good.  Packaging is all top notch.  There's nothing noticeable, in my opinion, when it comes to the transfer.  There will always be nit pickers but most are in for an enjoyable experience.  I watched this film more than 5 times on digital cable and another 5+times on DVD.",1400976000,,1401,4.588709677419355
8537156,5,B009762D1C,This is a super movie about PED and the 1988 100m race. Some great footage on Ben Johnson at home too!,1378166400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8537157,3,B009762D1C,"ESPN delves into the 1988 Summer Olympics and the much-publicized sprinter's duel between Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis in the 100m final. The film is an oral history of sorts, with interviews from all eight participants in the race, but often devolves into finger-pointing and contradiction. In some respects that's revealing in and of itself - clearly, nobody wants to take any blame for the sad state of affairs that led to such a high-profile blowup, when they're each partially responsible - but in others it's maddeningly frustrating. With their athletic days now long behind them, the only thing many of these former runners have to hold onto is their legacy, and they stomp all over that by slamming Johnson for his positive test, then sheepishly fessing up to their own PED suspensions near the end of the picture. As a historical panorama, this is entertaining - particularly in the build to the race itself - but when the central debate flares up and the runners each begin painting themselves as the victim, nobody's there to hold their feet to the fire.",1371427200,,1063,4.846153846153846
8537158,5,B009762D1C,This film reviews one of the great Olympic races of all time by looking at events five years before and following through the event.  Carl Lewis gives a wonderful summation of the events as he saw them.  It makes no sense why Ben Johnson was caught taking PEDs.  Producers did a great job pulling all the pieces together of this historical event.,1365811200,,346,4.548387096774194
8537159,5,B009762D1C,"This 30 for 30: 9.79* is in the top 10 best of all times for the series. This video is a must watch for anyone who remembers the rivalry of Ben vs Carl Lewis, calls themselves a track fan, or wants to know what athletes will do to win. This movie will have the viewers asking many questions. Everyone who watches this movie will ask ""Who is Andre Action Jackson?"" This man and Carl's coach had a plan. Did the plan get carried out? You will look at Carl Lewis in a manner that you have NEVER looked at him before. What would Carl do to win? Watch the movie and I'm sure you won't be able to answer that question. The Seoul 1988 Olympic 100 should be renamed the Seoul 1988 Olympic 100: The few that got away. Several of the men in this race would later get caught for using enhancing drugs. When did they start using the drugs? 1985? 1986? or 1988?",1364169600,2,848,4.1454545454545455
8537160,5,B009762D1C,very entertaining.  All 30/30's seen have been wonderful to watch and make great gifts.  I recommend them to others. a+,1362700800,,119,4.9
