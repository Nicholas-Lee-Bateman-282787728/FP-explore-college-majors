The newspapers tell of another pyjama suicide. Where is Sherlock Holmes? Fishing in Scotland. Its the most shocking crime wave since Jack the Ripper. There is an accident with Holmes! The newspapers report Holmes drowned! Watson wasn't around to help. A postman delivers a package to Watson, then a surprise! Sherlock explains the deceit, its to better investigate the crime. There is a link between these deaths. Sherlock dons a disguise (Colonel Rajni Singh) and visits a gambling house. He meets Adrea there, and loses at the wheel. Sherlock gets her fingerprints, she learns of the disguise. At home Sherlock prepares for an unknown visitor. His flashlight shows a big spider entering through an air vent! Holmes rushes to the roof and finds a man. He sees the footprints of a child. A visitor arrives to see Watson, he is an expert on spiders.

That lady visits Holmes and asks him to find a missing person, Singh. She brought along a young boy (who acts strangely). As they leave they throw a candy wrapper into the fire, it generates smoke! Mr. Ordway is afraid, he sold the spiders. Holmes exposes him as a fake! The real Ordway is dead. The link to the murderers is broken. Watson tells Holmes about that skeletons condition; it is a small adult. Holmes deduced who made that small footprint and goes to an arcade to view the attractions. Holmes sees Adrea there with her partner. Holmes goes to a fortune teller and falls into a trap! Adrea plans to eliminate Holmes. Holmes is placed behind the figure of a hated enemy in the shooting gallery. Watson tries the shooting gallery, Inspector Lestrade watches. Will Holmes be shot? Not if he escapes in time (which he does). The police round up the gang and the suitcase. Planning a murder in the middle of a Carnival shows cleverness. [But its really an over-cleverness that fails because of its assumptions.]

This story is composed of elements from Conan Doyles stories. Someone who collects from the insurance policy of suicides? I thought a suicide cancels the insurance policy. Wouldnt an insurance company be suspicious of anyone who collected insurance money from an unrelated person? Note how people enjoyed the right to keep and bear arms. Shooting galleries provided entertainment. Note how this warns against gambling, like the Silver Blaze story. Was the ending designed to allow a future return of the Spider Woman?",1457308800,,2435,4.891041162227603
