7690060,4,B01CUMHBJS,"""Eye In the Sky"" (2015 release from the UK; 102 min.) brings the story of a potential strike against Al Shabaab terrorists in Kenya. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""Nairobi, Kenya 7:45 am"", as we see a young girl playing hula-hoops. Next we are in ""Surrey, England"" where Colonel Katherine Powell is just waking up, and getting ready for a long day. Next we are in ""Nevada, Las Vegas"", where we see a couple of drone pilots reporting for work. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it will play out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Gavin Hood, best known for ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"" and most recently ""Ender's Game"". Here he takes on a tough modern warfare drama and suspense thriller. I have no idea what is depicted in the film is an accurate reflection of how drone war fare is done in reality. But let's assume for a minute that it is more or less accurate. What we witness in this film is an emotional rollercoaster and gut-punch, frankly. The many layers of legal, political and military considerations create an almost impossible environment in which to take sound decisions. Yet decisions must be made, even a non-decision can equal to making a decision with potentially devastating consequences. Interestingly, much of the movie plays out in real time, and that simply increases the level of intensity that we experience in this movie. There are a number of top performances, including Helen Mirror as Colonel ""ice in my veins"" Powell but also Alan Rickman as the British general. The movie is dedicated to Alan's memory (he passed away after a short illness before the movie's release). ""Eye In the Sky"" isn't the first movie about the moral dilemmas pertaining to drone warfare, and it certainly won't be the last. You may recall last year's ""Good Kill"" (starring Ethen Hawke), but let me tell you, ""Eye In the Sky"" is so much better as a movie. Finally, if you wonder whether the Alan Parsons Project classic hit ""Eye In the Sky"" is featured in the movie (as I wondered too), it is not. But there is a fine orchestral score from Paul Hepker and Mark Kilian.

""Eye In the Sky"" finally went wide this weekend after several weeks of selected cities. I had seen the trailer and couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great, somewhat to my surprise, considering the positive critical acclaim this movie has been getting from. I had high expectations coming in, and they were easily met, and then some. If you are in the mood for a top-notch drone war fare suspense thriller that raises some pointed moral questions along the way, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Eye In the Sky"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1459468800,2,2792,4.638383838383838
7690061,2,B01CUMHBJS,"Movie-making is the banker's art form, and this film is a brilliant illustration of that. Brilliant in the sense that the success of Eye in the Sky as Hitchcock-inspired ""entertainment"" guarantees that Anglo-American attitudes toward the war on terror will be unaffected by this film.

In fact, insofar as Eye in the Sky pricks our consciences, we can now feel we've atoned for the many sins of our banker-controlled military occupation of the world, and relax again about the whole thing. ""My complicity is erased, because I sat through a two hours of penance.""  Back to my real life now...

That's the way the fig leaf of Western morality works. Forget the history of Western economic exploitation that creates the Nairobi's of the world, and the ""suicide bombers"" that epitomize Western demonology. Pray tell me, what political options are there for a people trapped in the poverty and squalor of the urban south?

The fact that we've gone from a complex film like Battle of Algiers to this popcorn movie in a short 50 years tells us all we need to know about the direction history is taking--we can expect perpetual drone warfare for the foreseeable future.

The two stars are for the devastating performance of Aaron Paul, at least the part where he bares his humanity for just a minute.",1458864000,3,1292,4.828054298642534
7690062,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Whats it about?

A drone-led terrorist capture mission in Kenya takes an unexpected turn, throwing up an intriguing ethical dilemma for all those involved. In one of his last roles, Alan Rickman plays a typically cynical general, with Captain Phillips Barked Abdi in a pivotal on-the-ground role.

What did I think?

This extraordinarily-gripping thriller keeps you guessing and mulling all the way, as you see through the eyes of the frankly bizarre world of modern remote warfare, tiny beetle drones and all. Superb performances from a global cast and an excellent script combine to make this a winner thatll leave your cogs turning long after you leave the theater.

Its got Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman in it. That should tell you all you need to know.",1458691200,4,757,4.937007874015748
7690063,5,B01CUMHBJS,"A timely and emotionally disturbing picture of the drone war against terrorism and the ultimate price of collateral damage.  We are brought into a British intel operation, in coordination with the Kenyan military on the ground against the Somali terrorist organization, Al Shabbab trying to run a suicide bombing mission in Kenya, but the drone aircraft is US and the pilot and system operators are based in the U.S. All three military organizations are working in close coordination on this mission to capture two high ranking Al Shabbab British subjects and a U.S. citizen as well. The anti-terrorist mission is ultimately commanded out of London by high ranking officers and government officials. The mission's original purpose to capture and detain falls through so the various actors involved are left with a choice of taking out the terrorists with a drone strike in a civilian area and or  scrubbing the mission and allowing yet another vicious bombing to proceed.

We are early on introduced to a beautiful and intelligent young Somali girl, and I doubt anyone will be surprised she will become a central part of the plot. Helen Mirren is as always brilliant in her role as the rather ruthless British tactical commander as is Alan Rickman as her commander back in London.in what I assume was his final role. The British officers and politicians go round and round debating every nuance while the politicians keep trying to find someone else to take ultimate responsibility no matter how long the clock ticks. This contrasts starkly in the film with the US political attitude which is essentially this is a no brainer, However, the actual U.S. aircraft operators who can see every target's face up close and personal find the prospect emotionally overwhelming.

All of the actors, including the girl and her family along with the Kenyan intel team, do a great job in their roles. The film does a very fine job in building mounting frustration and tension as we get closer to decision time and it's probable ultimate price. We get also some very interesting looks at drone surveillance technolgy including two micro drones, one a bird and another a beetle. not sure if those are actually in production just yet or only in development.  In any case, the film is well worth watching and certainly very timely in its portrayal of the drone war against terror and the dilemmas it presents in terms of the price of action vs. inaction. The only real question is why it has taken this long to come up with such a powerful story.",1458518400,51,2529,4.8584686774942
7690064,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Writers are evil. They give us impossible situations and expect us to stick around til the end. One of our favorite women of a certain age: Helen Mirren plays a military officer calling the shots as a drone attack directive escalates from ""Capture"" to ""Kill"" when they spot suicide bombers. Suddenly a little girl wanders into the kill zone. Shoot? Don't Shoot? Mirren's character has been tracking this terrorist for years; she does NOT want to give up now!

Director Gavin Hood brings us another action-filled nail-biter, this time about modern warfare where the trigger man is a continent away from his target. In fact decisions are made from England, Nevada, Nairobi, Pearl Harbor, Beijing and Singapore. Screenwriter Guy Hibbert knows just how to jangle our nerves and question our sense of decency and fair play. We also see a massive sampling of modern hi-tech weaponry and communications.

Here's part of the cast:
  * Helen Mirren (""RED"") Colonel Katherine Powell has to make the call, but now that the directive has changed, the Rules of Engagement force her to seek additional permission.
  * Alan Rickman (""Harry Potter"") Lieutenant General Frank Benson is willing to back her if and when that ""committee"" at his command post can agree. He tells one of them, ""Don't ever tell a soldier he doesn't understand war.""
  * Aaron Paul (""Breaking Bad"") American drone pilot Steve Watts has the target in his sights... He has his orders. He understands the issues. Now what?
  * Barkhad Abdi (""Captain Phillips"") Agent Jama Farah is doing his very best to help our heroes with his skills on the ground, but there is that hardworking little girl...
  * Jeremy Northam (Lots of TV) Brian Woodale is only one of many who won't make the call. Instead, questions are ""kicked upstairs"" in this alphabet soup of international warfare, moral quandaries and decision making.
  * Monica Dolan (Lots of TV) Angela Northman insists the propaganda would be worse for the Allies if they kill one nine-year-old girl than it would be if al-Qaeda kills 60 civilians with two suicide bombers whom the Allies had allowed to escape.

Just when we think we know what we would do in the same circumstances, moral and ethical quandaries become messier: One life versus many lives. There is NO right answer and everyone pleads his or her case so eloquently we find ourselves in agreement, until... This is involving, exhausting and brilliant!

If you question the ending, it was ever thus: In war, truth is the first casualty - Aeschylus",1458345600,36,2517,4.900943396226415

It is even a thought provoking movie from a moral standpoint.  Where this film loses stars is in its overwrought emotional stand.

The finale is not the highlight of movie - but here we go again with real life played out on the tarnished screen.  Many other movies would have had similar plots if not almost identical - so there's really nothing new under the sun here folks. This is not a typical popcorn movie.

7690117,4,B01CUMHBJS,"In my view, this film makes (what I hope is) its point in spite of its every effort and, in that sense, one might say that it snatches victory from the jaws of self-defeat.

Let me explain. I hope the point of this film is to portray a deeply emotional and suspenseful event in a way that is balanced enough to make all viewers less sure of their moral positions. This, in my view, would be useful both to each of us and to society as a whole.

However, along the way it gives several impressions that I believe detract from the film itself. First, it gives the impression that the people at the very top (the politicos) are both mettlesome, unprepared, and incompetent. This makes the film feel throughout as if it were highly partisan Hollywood propaganda.

Second, it gives the impression that the people at the drone controls are unprepared (morally, ethically, emotionally) for the consequences that naturally follow what they have chosen to do for a living. This also gives the film a superficial propagandistic feel.

On the other hand, it does offer some nuggets that make sitting through this film somewhat worthwhile.

First, it offers us the opportunity to reflect on the moral asymmetry that could very well doom the West and guarantee the ascendency of the radical Jihadi Islamists. They apparently care nothing about who they slaughter in the name of Allah. We fume and dither endlessly over an otherwise compelling equation: 80+ probable, innocent casualties is allegedly worth less in the in the minds of some war than one innocent casualty.

If the Jihadis win by grinding down the West, this confusion in the minds of many will be one of the first reasons why. Putting people in the chain of command with every conceivable frame of reference is NOT helpful in doing what must be done to prevail against an absolutely ruthless adversary.

It could be argued that making a film that self-consciously seeks to validate all such frames of reference as equally valid only advances the probability that the war, already micromanaged by self-serving politicians and bureaucrats, will be won by the Jihadis.

Nonetheless, a film that makes this obvious might be useful to those leaning toward, but still uncommitted to, the surrender of the West.

Another kernel of understanding suggested by this film: While Western pluralism is often a strength it has bred indecisiveness, and our indecisiveness is the hidden enabler of Jihadi success.

So, was this film trying to consider any of these points or simply pander to the Anti-war crowd? I hope it was, but I have no idea... and perhaps that is the best thing (and the worst) about this film.",1493856000,,2652,4.8344370860927155

The acting is top notch and the plot feels plausible, though I don't and can't know how realistic the movie is, given that I have no access to how these operations really unfold and the technology available to do so.

But it was still fascinating to observe and myself wrestle with the strategic, ethical, political, and legal dilemmas and uncertainties involved, and to weigh the perspective each character brought to these decisions.  In the end, we see that there will rarely be clean ""right"" answers which don't involve tradeoffs and adverse consequences.

It also covers the effect on the people making big military decisions as well as the effect on the people who  physically carry out these missions.  I will be thinking about this movie for a long time!  If you like to talk about or think about moral and ethical issues,  you can't watch this movie and not be affected.

When I say drama, I mean it in its truest sense, if you are looking for an action movie, this is not for you.
If however you want edge of the seat tension, I highly recommend this film.
Featuring among others (in his last on screen performance) Alan Rickman, the film takes place in multiple locations simultaneously.
I read that the director filmed the scenes that way, and deliberately kept the cast separated during filming each scene, this certainly adds to the credibility of the film very well.
Without going into the story, it deals on multiple levels with the burdens of command, decision making, consequence and morality of this type of warfare. Some of the factual aspects may have been stretched a little, but the overall result is really great cinema.
Regardless of which side of the fence you are on with regard to the very real, and current war on terrorism this film will undoubtedly alarm, frustrate, enlighten or even mesmerize you.

7690243,4,B01CUMHBJS,"There is a mirror here . . .

The reason for the polarized opinions on ""Eye In The Sky"" is that you will see into it what is meant for you to see.  And for some who rejected it completely, perhaps there is a bit of denial of social culpability for our perpetual wars that often cause the very thing they profess to extinguish.

Some think it's a ""left-wing"" ploy, which is absurd and hyper-defensive considering Alan Rickman's final statement.  Some who abhor war and its costs see the movie as a complex and insufficient apologia of our military/industrial complex and what must be done for one's country.

I don't believe that the creators of this film meant for there to be easy answers.  It is well-done and thoughtful and a necessary in-your-face for citizens who have avoided thinking about our armchair wars overseas.

One may quarrel that the drone operation dramatized here is over-the-top, but we now know that drone operators do deal with similar situations, although perhaps rarely with that level of confusion and dissent.  As evidence now suggests, at least the US is becoming way too cavalier about ""collateral damage.""  It's easier when there are ways to disguise the count.  Whether most drone operators would hesitate as much as did the one in the movie is irrelevant.  There's a point to be made here.

The dichotomy between cold-blooded rationale for immediate action and the obfuscations of bureaucracy are well played out in EITS.  It's more about the inner workings and conflicts of social conscience than a misrepresentation of the far more efficient and perhaps cold-blooded drone operations employed by actual military forces.  Perhaps the ""moral lesson"" of the British female pol was a bit heavy-handed.  But the other characters were fairly straightforward and believable.

In the end, we are left contemplating the profound and simple contrast between a young, innocent girl selling bread and a cabal of suicide bombers preparing to die for their god.  And left wondering what part the West has played in this demoralized fragmentation.",1471824000,,2065,5.008797653958944

Now they can take the house out but there will be  significant collateral damage to civilians. In particular, the film focuses on a little girl who quite likely will be killed if the house is targeted. The story seems to be very similar to one I read of an Israeli helicopter attack on a Hamas terrorist that was called off in the last minute because a young boy could have been killed if the Israeli helicopter launched its missile.

One of the points that came out very well is the micro managing of modern war from the top. While the people who have to decide are covering themselves by getting their leaders to take decisions for them. I was thinking while watching this film, of one piece of advice a soldier once made, lose the radio connection to your superiors in battle because they interfere too much.

In this film much of the decisions would have been determined already. Perhaps what the film was that the British not having as much experience with this sort of warfare have not worked it out.

The acting was good. The characters were interesting. The filming was good.

I noticed that Barkhad Abdi (from the Captain Phillips movie starring Tom Hanks) is in the Eye In The Sky film as well in an important role that I prefer to avoid discussing out of consideration for those who have yet to see the movie. Anyhow, the character of Powell ends up trying to coordinate authorization with Benson for a legitimate action in a timely manner with 2nd lieutenant Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) and A1C Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox). However, one of the major obstacles to timely defense comes up when various parties (played by Iain Glen,Monica Dolan, and more people etc.) cannot agree on when andor if to attack. Part of the controversy relates to the scenario of a little girl Alia (Aisha Takow) being affected by whatever is decided.

with the intent of killing many.
It becomes clear to 'Colonel Katherine Powell' (Helen Mirren)  that a strike on the Kenyan house where three of
the most wanted along with prospective suicide bombers are is the only option open to her...but she'll need
clearance from a higher authority to go ahead.
At a 'Cobra-meeting 'Lieutenant General Frank Benson' (Alan Rickman) has to convince a group of government
ministers that this is the right course of action to take...though they are reluctant to give the go-ahead without
authority from higher-office, a situation that is proving frustrating for 'Colonel Powell'

sets up a stall a little beyond the wall of the targeted-house selling bread her mother had made, pilot 'Steve Watts'

A superior-drama with many fine performances along the way perhaps none more-so than 'Aisha Takow'

One of the most tension-filled films i've seen in many a day....a genuine must-see in my view.

7690260,4,B01CUMHBJS,"We watched Eye in the Sky recently and found it to be a timely subject with the terrors raging around our world today.

The review and synopsis on The Guardian will do this plot more justice than I could.  Here is a snippet from that article:

We open in Nairobi, where Aisha Takows young Alia twirls a hula hoop in her backyard. Throughout the drama, which plays out on closely observed monitor screens, we shall return to such aerial views of Alia, caught on airborne surveillance cameras, the words not for targeting significantly nestled in the bottom left of the frame.

From Nairobi we flit in quick succession to London, Nevada, Pearl Harbor and beyond, as the key players in a joint anti-terror operation assemble. Foremost among them is Helen Mirrens Katherine Powell, the no-nonsense British colonel on the trail of al-Shabaab terrorists, most notably a radicalised UK citizen. Her mission is to capture, not kill the high-priority targets gathering near the yard where Alia plays. But when the spectre of an imminent suicide attack rears its head, her priorities become more lethal, as does the prospect of civilian casualties.

This was Alan Rickmans last on screen role and he played it well. You could feel and hear his barely controlled frustration as politicians passed the buck on making a decision. There was no time to spare in deciding if a Hellfire missile should be deployed to eliminate 4 well known terrorists.

Between the referring back and forth to higher ranks and the calls between the UK, US and Nairobi it was nail biting at times. Other times this movie seemed to move at a very slow pace. A conundrum as you know a real and imminent threat was about to be unleashed and there was the ability to stop it immediately.

How do you choose between the certain sacrifice of an innocent girl who is in the line of fire and that of eliminating suicide bombers. You watched as the suicide vests were loaded up and fitted to the volunteers. You watched as they made their video before planning to go out to a crowded shopping center or public place to detonate and kill many innocent people. One girls life or a hundred lives?

At times it was a tense movie yet slow moving and, as I said, very timely in regard to the horrific news we see and read these days.  Great acting by Helen Mirren, Iain Glen and Alan Rickman just to single out two of my favorites.",1471219200,,2381,4.636579572446556

7690274,5,B01CUMHBJS,"This movie shows why it is impossible for Western countries to win any wars.  Western countries are far too focused on minimizing ""collateral damage,"" but the problem is that this makes it literally impossible to defeat the enemy.  We did not win World War II by worrying about collateral damage.  When it comes to defeating terrorists, or foreign enemies, the most important thing is to focus on the mission: which is to destroy the enemy.  If we are always focused on collateral damage, it is just not possible to ever win.  Plus, it makes no sense in any case because eliminating the terrorists will result in fewer civilians being killed in the end in any case.  Sometimes, when I watch a movie like this, I wish that I was in charge of a war mission.  I would merely ask the generals, ""What can we do to defeat the enemy?""  I would then give them the authority to do whatever it is that they felt would be necessary to defeat the enemy.

7690306,2,B01CUMHBJS,"This movie is disappointing.  The plot is too simple.  It's really one scenario for the entire movie.  The idea is that this one scenario creates a moral dilemma forcing the main characters to talk through all the politics, ethics, and legalities of the situation.  It starts to drag on as you realize they aren't going to go anywhere further with the movie.  There aren't any surprises in the movie at all.

The movie is also a bit unbalanced.  On the one hand there is a fairly good cast however most of them act as if they are in a play rather than a movie.  Helen Mirren, an outstanding actress, is simply not believable in her role.  One major comlaint I had was that none of the actors presented a deep character or one you feel any interest or connection with.  None of them had any character development or art whatsoever.

Then there are the special effects.  We are led to believe that some extremely high tech Bond style gadgets exist.  Yet they don't seem believable.  For instance there is a robotic bug that acts as a remote camera.  The flying mechanism (wings flapping) is not believable but it's really the crystal clear video that also is not believable.  I could suspend belief if the video was a little lower resolution or flickers and showed some flaws to be a pin prick camera.  Which also brings me to the drone video.  It too, is simply to clear and high resolution to be believable.  Most movie goers won't care but it's lazy.

Another movie, which is infinitely better, is Good Kill, staring Ethan Hawke.  It's the same concept, drone pilots faced with dilemmas.  however, Good Kill presents real deep characters in a stressful job breaking under the pressure.  Good Kill manages to navigate all the pot holes that Eye in the Sky fell for.

You will notice, both received a fairly high rating.  I believe this movie is two stars and Good Kill is 3.5 stars.  Neither live up to the higher ratings they are receiving.  I believe that higher rating is more of a reflection of sympathy for the subject matter.  The point of both movies is to portray the cold, brutal, and even evil method of using drones to kill people.  I think people can identify with that.",1468627200,,2182,4.551546391752577

7690316,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Eye In the Sky explores the military, legal, political, and moral factors that must be considered in drone warfare, a type of engagement carried out from bunkers and conference rooms through inter-communication, video screens, and cleverly disguised spy cameras. Armed, airborne drones make it possible to inflict pinpointed, devastating destruction without ever coming face to face with the enemy. No matter how precisely targeted a drone strike may be, collateral damage is always a possibility.

Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) is a UK-based military officer in command of a top-secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Through remote surveillance and on-the-ground intelligence, Powell discovers that the targets are in a safe house in the middle of a small village where they are preparing for a suicide bombing that could kill many people and severely injure many more, and the mission changes from capture to kill.

Col. Powells team are working in collaboration with the American military. Just as American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage, a nine-year-old girl (Aisha Takow) enters the kill zone, setting off a dispute that reaches the highest levels of both the British and United States governments.

Other key players include Lt. General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman), stationed in London and tasked with coordinating the operation; local spy on the ground Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi, Captain Phillips); Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox), Watts fellow drone pilot; and British government ministers (Jeremy Northam, Monica Dolan).

The movie traces the operation from its onset, with new information changing the object of the mission and unforeseen circumstances causing a complex discussion weighing the value of taking out known terrorists against the unavoidable death of innocent people. Whatever decision is made will affect international politics, propaganda value, and the saving of lives. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and the terrorists could finish their preparations and head out on their deadly mission at any moment.

Ms. Mirren brings authority to her role as Col. Powell, a woman convinced that firing into the safe house despite the inevitable threat to innocent people, represented by one young child selling bread nearby, is essential. Her superior officer, Lt. Benson, agrees, but they are hampered by the politicians and the militarys own legal advisors, who have specific guidelines for such a strike that includes the acceptable amount of collateral damage.

Director Gavin Hood has fashioned an absolutely riveting motion picture that doesnt settle on easy answers. If this were a typical action picture, the drone attack would merely be one action sequence in a fast-paced shoot-em-up adventure. But Hood takes his time, exploring all the factors facing the decision-makers, all the while heightening the suspense. No previous film has taken the viewer into the minds and hearts of the people who run the drone program. When we attach faces and names and show that many of these folks struggle with the tough decisions they have to make, we come to appreciate the degree that simple morality plays.

Rated R, Eye in the Sky is a real-time thriller in which all voices are heard: the tough pragmatist, the weary old soldier, the liberal who believes the death of innocents can never be justified, and the politician who will have to answer tough questions from the media. The film makes a strong argument for humanity informing military affairs.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc widescreen Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include several featureless, including Morals, which features a discussion with Helen Mirren, director Gavin Hood and producer Colin Firth about the moral and ethical questions raised in the film.",1468022400,,3770,5.356418918918919

7690318,1,B01CUMHBJS,"This film is absolutely ridiculous. I thought it was going to be about the logistics of fighting with drones and instead it turns out to be a leftist propaganda piece. The main gist of the film is the moral quandary of dropping a bomb on a home in Kenya where known terrorists can be seen via insectothopter (tiny flying bug camera) outfitting two men with suicide vests; outside of the house a young girl, maybe 9 years old, is selling bread her mother has made. Only Helen Mirren, playing a British Colonel, and Alan Rickman as a British Lt. General, have the guts to insist on taking out the house; the life of one little girl versus maybe 80 or so other lives lost if the suicide bombers succeed in getting to a crowded mall or school. Several other high-ranking officials from Britain, America and Kenya push off responsibility to their higher-ups, refusing to take responsibility for collateral damage. Aaron Paul, as the drone ""pilot"", actually *cries* at one point. This film makes the American military look like sensitive ninnies.

On the surface it is a movie about war or the new war on terror, but it is much, much more than that. It would probably bore a lot of people as 99% of the movie is about the decision making process before, during and after kill missions involving the military and political players. But, if you can stick it out until the end, it is a heart wrenching movie that may bring you to tears. Great acting all around by everyone and great production and direction. It is a beautiful portrayal of the emotions of all of the characters. It may seem strange to use a word like beautiful in reference to a war movie, but the emotional content seemed so real that I think it is appropriate. The movie is centered around a small Kenyan girl who becomes the focal point and most pivotal role in the movie.",1467590400,,942,4.181318681318682
7690328,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Overall it was a good movie. The acting was very good and the storyline was fairly realistic.

A quick synopsis: this movie is about a joint military operation between the US and Britain where a drone is being used to monitor specific terrorists; one being a British citizen and another being a US citizen. There's incredible drama and dilemma as Helen Mirren's character wants to drop a bomb on the house, where these terrorists are hiding and planning their next suicide attack, but there's an issue when an innocent girl is in the blast radius.

I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the ending is definitely worth watching the movie for. I felt at times that the movie dragged on a bit, but overall it was very good. I hope the movie isn't accurate about governments having access to surveillance equipment resembling bugs.

Overall a great suspenseful and action packed movie and will sure to resonate well with Veterans like myself.",1467590400,,939,4.748466257668712
7690329,4,B01CUMHBJS,"We just rented this and thought it was very good. Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman were excellent in their roles. The best part of the film is what it shows. Politics needs to stay out of wars. All politics does is clog up the works. Sometimes, in order to save many lives, a few lives must be sacrificed. That is the name of the game. Unfortunately, America has given into politics and sadly, as a result, is losing in the battle against ISIS and terrorism. When you're dealing with fanatics, you cant go half way. This film does a great job of showing why. DVD is of excellent quality in both audio and video quality.
  Overall, a great character study and action film.",1467590400,2,668,4.4227642276422765
7690330,5,B01CUMHBJS,"As technology advances, war doesnt. There is nothing heroic about war though heroic actions take place every minute in the form of soldiers and leaders who must make both long range and split second decisions which never are wholly correct because war is death vs. life, the saving of some lives by destroying others, and such decisions are ones that a world without war would not face. Every war (or now as we are all too aware simultaneous wars) introduces new weapons  either more power (as in the atomic bomb, etc) or more sophisticated spying. This film is about the endless war on terrorism and the use of drone cameras (carried in drone planes, drone beetles, drone humming birds) that aid in directing destruction into more specific areas rather than simply bombing an entire city or village or country.

Gavin Hood directs (and plays a significant acting role) this screenplay by Guy Hibbert, very correctly titled EYE IN THE SKY  a film that reveals all the permutations of drone spying and targeting enemies. The story Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), a UK-based military officer in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Through remote surveillance and on-the-ground Intel, Powell discovers the targets are planning a suicide bombing and the mission escalates from ""capture"" to ""kill."" But as American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage, a nine-year old girl enters the kill zone triggering an international dispute, reaching the highest levels of US and British government, over the moral, political, and personal implications of modern warfare. The majority of the film  as we watch a group of terrorist ready themselves for a suicide attack  takes place in the offices of the British and American decision makers who simply cannot resolve the question of strike with a known casualty result in the periphery of the staging facility we have been observing. The key figure in the struggle as to whether or not to carry out orders to missile bomb the compound is the very green new soldier (Aaron Paul) who simply cannot agree to carry out orders when those orders would mean the death of a young girl selling bread near the target.

The struggle for power in decision making includes Alan Rickman (his farewell performance as he died in January 2016), Richard McCabe, Jeremy Northam, Monica Dolan, Michael OKeefe, Laila Robins, James Alexander, Kim Engelbrecht among others. There is a brilliant cameo by Barkhad Abdi as the Kenyan attach who spies with his own set of drones (beetle, hummingbird, etc) and cares for the little bread-selling girl.

A brilliant movie about a horrifying situation  one that seems we will continue to hear about as this terrorist threat grows. Grady Harp, July 16",1467590400,2,2763,5.004357298474946

The scene with the drone crew in tears was rich. Also, the mini-drones that looked like a fake hummingbird and some sort of large beetle were ridiculous. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to pilot one of these types of drones FPV? FPV means first person view which simply means the only reference the pilot has is from an on board camera. People and soldiers all around and any idiot could spot the fake hummingbird sitting up on the pole. Not to mention that the wind would easily have blown it off the pole because these things weigh very little. The slightest breeze also has a large effect on a drone this small in flight. Once it starts to fly it would be even more obvious and yet they are going to risk their ""mission"" by flying it right up to the house trying to look into windows. Bulls***. Ridiculous. Then their was the remotely piloted beetle. Even something this size makes enough noise that everyone in that house would have heard it flying around, looked at it and known it was fake.

I found myself very drawn into the unfolding narrative, and really drawn into the multi-layered story, which features the use of drone technology, satellites, and little spying creatures with wings.

This is perhaps the most engaging movie experience I have had in some time, offering something new and unique, and a refreshing contrast compared to the usual sequelitis of Hollywood.  Helen Mirren excellent as the pushy general, and the late Alan Rickman deserves a similar accolade in his role.  A woman political observer offers a conscientious dimension to what is happening.

7690346,3,B01CUMHBJS,"In case you didn't know, warfare is no longer about ace fighter pilots or troops crawling through muddy battlefields. In today's military, combat operations are conducted from trailers in the Nevada desert, the deathblow dealt by an officer's push of a button or swivel of a joystick, but not until the command has come down from some faceless politician thousands of miles away. Accountability at either end of the kill order is about as close to zero as one can get. In case you didn't know any of that, Hollywood has been making sure to get that point across with multiple films on the proliferation of drone warfare. Gavin Hood's ""Eye in the Sky"" is just the latest film to send the familiar warnings, but it does something a little different by presenting the complicated web of maneuvers it takes before the final call is made to strike.

The result is a film that is timely, certainly relevant, but as a thriller it gets bogged down in minutiae that may be authentic but isn't always entertaining. Screenwriter Guy Hibbert has delivered a concise yet meaty screenplay which effectively juggles multiple characters in multiple military and political scenarios. Helen Mirren plays Commander Katherine Powell, who rigidly leads a joint U.K./U.S. operation to capture radicalized British terrorist Aisha Al Hady (Lex King) who has joined up with Al Shabaab. Powell's mission includes drone surveillance piloted by Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) and his idealistic young partner, Carrie (Phoebe Fox), holed up in a bunker somewhere in Las Vegas. When the drone reveals that Hady is meeting up with high-level officers in the terrorist group, the decision to wipe them all out with an air strike is made. But first it must go through all of the necessary political channels, which is when Lieutenant General Frank Benson (the late Alan Rickman) comes in, haggling with different officials who are all trying to cover their own asses legally while watching everything unfold live.

If Hibbert and Hood's goal was to show the culture of bureaucratic stonewalling that comes with these life and death decisions, then they've more than succeeded. While the ""kill"" order has been given, there's collateral damage to consider and much of the film is spent watching analysts calculate the warhead's blast radius. Lawyers are called in to figure what the proper rules of engagement are, phone calls are made to U.S. heads of state who don't seem to much care; the whole thing is a trainwreck where split-second decisions of military importance go to die. But in the midst of all this hand-wringing events unfold on the ground where agents (Oscar-nominee Barkhad Abdi plays one) are putting their lives in danger to secure the proper intel. Abdi proves to be the film's heart and soul, whose sure-footed actions to save one potential victim's life injects a bit of sanity into the process.

To make its point the film does what most of these drone movies do, and that's posit a situation that is highly improbable if not downright impossible. And that opens up the door to a great deal of cornball philosophizing from those on every side of the issue, with all of them given ample time to make their points very clear. In that kind of environment, the analytical and the emotional are presented as being constantly at loggerheads, but that is pretty much the point of what ""Eye in the Sky"" is saying, and despite going a little overboard in saying it, the conversation the film should spark is well worth it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-in-the-Sky/dp/B01CUMHCRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye in the Sky</a>",1463788800,9,3644,5.090301003344481

This powerful film looked at unintended consequences and struck me  like an updated application of Augustine of Hippo's ""Just War Analysis"":
The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration. The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same time:
- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
- there must be serious prospects of success;
- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.
These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the just war doctrine.
The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catechism-of-the-Catholic-Church-2309/dp/1574551094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catechism of the Catholic Church, #2309</a>).",1460937600,2,1287,5.840425531914893

7690349,5,B01CUMHBJS,"With ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq having killed nearly five thousand U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, not to mention the hundreds of thousands more injured and maimed, the new kind of war against post-Al Qaeda terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabab is being done from the air via drones.  But the risk to innocent civilians is no less doing it that way than if there were actual troops with weapons on the ground.  If anything, the implications of carrying out these operations from a distance are even greater in legal, military, and moral terms, because every action undertaken will eventually produce blowback that can become a seemingly never-ending cycle of killing and maiming by both sides in the so-called War On Terror.  This is what is explored in EYE IN THE SKY.

Helen Mirren and the late Alan Rickman are the top British military officers in charge of going after a cell of Al-Shabab terrorists preparing for a potential suicide attack in Nairobi, where there happen to be two new recruits from Britain and another from the United States who had only recently become radicalized.  The terrorists have ensconced themselves at a house in a heavily crowded residential area in the Kenyan capital, and are being closely monitored on the ground by a Kenyan operative (Barkhad Abdi, who portrayed the chief pirate in 2013s CAPTAIN PHILLIPS).  Everything is confirmed and ready to destroy both the house and its occupants before they are able to carry out an attack that could kill at least eighty people, but the legal loopholes that they have to go through to be given the authority to carry out the drone strike are immense.  And the moral implications intervene when a young Kenyan girl is seen selling bread on the street side of the wall near the safe house, making her a potential casualty, what the military calls by the all-encompassing Orwellian euphemism collateral damage.  And the two U.S. military officers (Phoebe Fox, Aaron Paul) who are piloting the drone and its missile are watching all this from their seats at an air force base near Las Vegas.

Even when the strike is carried out after a lot of hand-wringing, resulting in the deaths of the terrorists and innocent civilians simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, the reverberations of what was done go well beyond the blast zone in Nairobi.  When, after the strike, Rickman tells one of his governments heads Never tell a soldier that he doesnt know the cost of war, he doesnt mean just the dead people at the strike itself, but the psychological toll it takes on the military, both officers and soldiers alike, and the implications for the world at large

It would be a fallacy, following how badly both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were botched by our political leaders here in America who were blinded by their own venality and arrogance, to think that the costs of carrying out a successful strike don't weigh heavily on the people in the military who are charged with approving such strikes and the soldiers or pilots responsible for carrying them out.  This is the crux of the matter in EYE IN THE SKY, as shown by director Gavin Hood (ENDERS GAME; X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE; RENDITION) and screenwriter Guy Hibbert (FIVE MINUTES OF HEAVEN).  Instead of being a rock em, sock em gung-ho action flick seemingly approved for public consumption by Bush, Cheney, et al, what we get instead is a very concise look at the military, legal, and, above all, the moral implications of our drone strike policies.  Mirren and Rickman (the latter often known for playing ruthless villains, as he did masterfully in 1988s DIE HARD) are excellent in their roles, even though they don't share any actual screen time together, but that is not to diminish the contributions made by Paul, Fox, or Abdi.  Nothing is done melodramatically or for the sake of showing the adrenaline lust for bloodthirsty proactive violence against undoubtedly cold-blooded inhuman monsters.  For that reason, EYE IN THE SKY is a film well worth seeing and discussing.",1460592000,3,4065,4.869565217391305
7690350,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.  This gripping modern day film about warfare operated continents away, does an excellent job raising ethical and moral issues and choices that must be made.  Helen Mirren stars as Col. Katherine Powell who has been tracking a female British citizen who married an Islamic terrorist and is complicit in designing further terrorist activity.  The woman, Susan Danford (Lex King) has been located in Somalia in an area known to harbor terrorists and their sympathizers.  Her companions include an American citizen.

Using highly sophisticated cameras, primarily from a drone but also a robotic bird and insect, their original mission of capture quickly changes as it appears that an imminent suicide bombing is being organized.  The bird and insect are controlled locally by military men working with the British.  The drone is controlled in Nevada by Lt. Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) and his technical assistant, Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox).  Director Gavin Hood (Enders Game), who also plays Watts immediate supervisor, Lt. Col. Ed Walsh, provides a clear chain of command as to how the decisions are made as well as integrating various components including satellite control from Hawaii.

When the mission goes from capture to kill, the rules of engagement change and Powell must get clearance from British and American officials.  Back in London, a conference room watching the activities include Gen. Frank Benson (Alan Rickman in his final film performance), the Attorney General and a couple cabinet secretaries.  After the go ahead is given, the already tense moments are heightened when a 9 year old Somali girl sets up a stand to sell bread, next to the building holding the terrorists and their numerous weapons, including suicide vests.  So now what?  Do they go ahead with the strike, potentially preventing massive deaths by suicide bomber, knowing that they will also certainly kill the girl and numerous other civilians?

It isn't an easy decision even for Powell and Benson who want to proceed.  Hood makes sure we know who this girl is.  We see her play early in the film.  Shes a good daughter who helps her parents in this unhealthy environment.  As the numerous trailers show, Watts is reluctant to proceed given the certainty of civilian casualties and new calculations must be made and possibly manipulated to ease the conscious.  The performances are excellent, especially from Mirren and Rickman.  The film looks authentic (filmed in South Africa) and will leave you with a tight hold of your seat.  This is a well-made film from any perspective and one of the best of the year.",1460332800,7,2639,5.102564102564102
7690351,5,B01CUMHBJS,"If you're looking for glory, mud-trench bravery, and the masses of bad guys, you came to the wrong century. Wars aren't that simple any more,and enemies aren't, and battlefields aren't, and victories aren't.

It sounds simple. We know who, where, and when. We have surveillance and an attack team close by. But, No battle plan survives contact with the enemy. That doesn't mean the battle ended, but it changed. And, in this case, the stakes went way up. They're no longer out to capture some 'high value' jihadis, they need to prevent dozens of civilian deaths when the suicide bombers attack their soft and densely populated targets.

If only it were that simple. This turns into a wrenching, behind-the-scenes look at modern, long-range, push-button warfare. But real people with real feelings push buttons, and administrative oversight collides with tactical reality, and ... 'complicated' doesn't half describe it. And, if you're looking for the real hero of this story, I think you should look at the one guy closest to it, throwing money around, risking everything to pull a little girl out of harm's way. He ends up with not a tenth the credit I think he deserves.

7690352,5,B01CUMHBJS,"""Never tell a soldier he doesn't understand the cost of war."" Alan Rickman's final words in his final on-screen movie. This movie will make you question what you think you would do in a situation, and it makes you question the moral line you believe you have for yourself. When does that line get blurry? When does it get crossed?
Alan Rickman is my all-time favorite actor. I say is because it will always remain that way. I would have seen, and bought, this movie just because he is in it and because I own all his movies. However, after seeing the trailer I know I would have also seen it if he hadn't been in it. His performance is wonderful as always. The movie is dedicated to his memory, as he died shortly before its release. It's his last on-screen movie and he did wonderful.
Ellen Mirren is good as usual. She has to make a call that makes you feel a lot of different things.
When does the life of one become worth it to save the lives of many? It's the ongoing question in this movie, along with when politics should or should not be mixed with military operations. In a world that is at war, this is a question I imagine many of those involved asking regularly. We think we know what we would do, but do we? All throughout the movie I agreed with Alan and Ellen in what should happen, but even now that I'm back home I can't think about how that makes me feel.
There are a lot of movies coming out these days that are fluffy, or action filled or fun. There aren't nearly enough movies these days that make you think. I love that this one did and recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly good movie with truly strong acting by everyone from the extras to the main stars.",1460246400,3,1697,4.2407407407407405
7690353,5,B01CUMHBJS,"Nine Things About the Film ""Eye in the Sky""

1. This is one of the best movies of 2016. It's intelligent, suspenseful, and relevant.

2. I've never seen a war movie like this one. It's about the use of drone strikes on terrorist targets, and the complicated things that must happen before a drone actually attacks. Much of the movie is seen from the viewpoint of the drone flying above the suggested target, dispassionately tracking things, no matter how emotional everything else is getting.

3. The plot of the movie concerns a joint British-American operation to capture three terrorists. Our technology is such that the British can command things from their base in Britain, and the Americans can control the drone from their base in Las Vegas. The drone itself is in Nairobi, Kenya.

The situation of the target becomes more complicated, and what was intended to be a capture operation becomes a possible kill operation. The situation focuses more tightly on the target, while simultaneously expanding to people all over the globe.

4. The technology used in the movie is a mixture of things that are currently being used, as well as things that exist but are still being prepared for field use. This is both fascinating and scary.

5. The characters each represent a certain facet of war - violence, law, politics, ethics, and propaganda. They all get into a frustratingly ludicrous chain of command, in which everyone needs everyone else's permission to do anything. The movie made me realize that the line between caution and cowardice is very very blurry - and absurd.

6. The characters also represent a certain cost of war - physical, emotional, psychological, and moral. The cost of everything becomes a set of probabilities, a few immutable numbers. The real mission in war is finding the people willing to pay such costs.

7. About halfway through the movie, I made my decision about what I would do in that situation, and I didn't change it. This meant that I also had to take responsibility, however vicariously, for the results of the movie's events.

8. The cast is top-notch. Helen Mirren was very impressive as the military colonel ready to get the job done. This was also Alan Rickman's last on-screen role before his death, and he was great as the increasingly frustrated mission supervisor.

9. This is a thought-provoking, discussion-starting film that touches one of the hottest buttons in military politics today. No matter what your opinion is on the movie's topics, the world you live in before you see this movie is a little different than the world you will live in after you see it.",1459641600,125,2613,4.864864864864865

This is Pure Propaganda...!!
The way The USA uses drones as assassins and machines of murder is why they put Bradley Manning in prison.
