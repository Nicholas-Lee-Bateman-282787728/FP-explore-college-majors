(They also sent us the DVD set since my internet connection isn't too great.)

The online version also has quizes at the end of each module.  At the end of the course, they send 2 copies of completion to our adoption agency.  This seminar is Hague approved, so it qualifies for the 10 hours of pre-adoption education that my agency requires.
The two ladies in the video are easy to listen to and are very engaging, esp with the live audience.
I have learned so much.  I am happy I found this seminar online!

Here is what the website says about the online seminar:

The Because They Waited education system is online with modules covering topics pertinent to individuals adopting a baby or an older child, internationally or through foster care.  Modules present ""The Science"" in a user friendly format, followed by ""The Parenting"" which offers concrete parenting tools and finally, ""Wrap Up, Review and Resources"". Topics covered include:

Promoting healthy brain development
Sensory processing and sensory integration
Parenting to a child's ""real age"" vs. chronological age
Understanding the internal alarm
Building attachment
Race and Culture
The Because They Waited system offers the option of testing online for up to two certificates of completion at no additional charge and provides 10 hours of Hague compatible education.",1312243200,,1425,5.107758620689655
8451342,1,B0026YWOJ8,"We're pre-adoptive parents, thrilled about the process and consuming all the books and information we can find in terms of information.  That being said, this DVD series was so artificial, badly produced, badly scripted and just insulting to any thinking person's intelligence that we had to fast-forward through 3/4 of it!  If there were a transcript, I would read it.  I'm sure there's some good information in there.  But watching these women FAKE these seminar in an empty room with false inflection and abnormal hand movements was nothing short of brutal to watch.  Don't waste your money. There are plenty of excellent adoption books out there that will make more efficient use of your time!",1300924800,,697,5.026086956521739
