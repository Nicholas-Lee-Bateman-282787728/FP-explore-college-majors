8171004,5,B000MR8SIW,My  3 older kids grew up watching this show.  Since it was no longer on the air I thought I would get it on DVD for my 3 younger children.  All 6 of my kids love this series.  They range in age from 11 to 25 now.  Oldie but goodie,1471996800,,230,3.52

8171006,5,B000MR8SIW,Do you ever feel that this type of media is just for the kids?  Think out of the box!  My wife and I are in the mature state of our life and we cannot tell you how much we have been blessed by this entire series. So much depth of spiritual content you will not want to miss a single episode.  Make it a family night for your children and grandchildren.  Pour spiritual truth into them with this unique God given dramatic presentation.  You will not be disappointed!!!!,1284249600,,468,4.2727272727272725
