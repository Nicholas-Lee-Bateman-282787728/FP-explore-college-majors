8660172,2,B00KMULA52,"I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. The packaging and product description were misleading. The set only contained 2 discs (not 3) and, even though there was a ""Bonus"" option on the 2nd DVD, clicking to access the bonus option just took me to the episode list - there was no Halloween special feature. I gave this product two stars vs. only one is because I did enjoy the historic information. Unfortunately, I don't anticipate ever watching it again and will likely sell it back to the vendor.",1501804800,,504,4.674157303370786
8660173,5,B00KMULA52,"The Halloween Special is on Disc 2, but it cannot be accessed through the DVD menu. To access the episode, you need to select ""Title 10"" in your player's playback menu.  Some players have a ""Title"" button on the remote control, but for those without a dedicated button, you may need to look at your player's documentation to find how to select Titles.
The special's video seems poorly compressed at the beginning, and after the show is finished, there is darkness followed by clips from the special without any audio. If you let the  special play through, it will send you to a DVD menu that cannot be accessed from the main menu. I've posted a screen capture of the hidden menu and of a photo of the cover of the 2 disc set.",1484179200,5,725,4.402985074626866

8660175,5,B00KMULA52,"This is an excellent series. It goes to old buildings in Britain. Then while you explore them, they tell you of great ghost stories that illuminate their histories. It is fun to watch even for us skeptics who just like a great yarn with beautiful architecture to view. It's also handy if you're thinking of traveling there and would like to stay in older, out-of-the-way buildings.
One problem, the picture claims that volume 2 has three discs and includes a Hallowe'en bonus. The set I got has only two discs and although there is a bonus option on the menu it goes nowhere (presumably because the item is on the not-included 3rd disc). I personally am searching Amazon UK to see if theirs has it as I own an all-region player. If not, I will keep this because the series is five stars, the product description is zero stars.",1444003200,,826,4.550335570469799

8660177,2,B00KMULA52,"The show is great but only two stars for the item not arriving as the packaging photo describes. Only two discs are included and there is no Halloween special. When you click  ""Bonus"" on the DVD menu it takes you right back to the episode list :(
I watched (and really enjoyed) the first season several years ago and was excited to see the DVD set here on Amazon. Had the photo not advertised a third DVD + bonus episode being included I would have given it a five star rating. If you don't mind not getting all that you pay for you'll likely find the show very entertaining!",1425254400,4,575,4.275229357798165
