Silly movie, with absurd, impossible ""creepy"" sounds that were comical.  No plot.  Just someone trying way too hard to be scarey.

I suggest doing something more entertaining, like washing the dishes.",1281571200,,300,4.94
8229919,4,B000TQY3I0,"Yes , this is the original version of ""The Strangers"" ... The movie kept me excited throughout however , although the ending is better than that of ""the strangers"" i still did not feel like the ending was good either ... I enjoy movies that leave you thinking or locking your front door every now and then ... Other then the mediocre ending, the movie is worth it ..",1241481600,2,366,4.318840579710145
