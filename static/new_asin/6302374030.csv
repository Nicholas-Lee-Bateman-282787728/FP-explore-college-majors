7824801,5,6302374030,"'NOUGH SAID.  i was this close to selling this video at a time of serious financial need...and i had to tell myself...""SNAP OUT OF IT!""  needless to say, i'm watching it right now and thought i'd search for it on DVD...nope!  what's that about.  LOVE IT!",1025568000,2,254,4.456521739130435
7824802,5,6302374030,"I bought this video years ago when I was in college, and it's a collector's item for Morrissey fans. Not only does it feature his videos up to 1990, it also contains footage from his very famous Wolverhampton gig. Plus, it also has the video to the much-maligned single ""Ouija Board, Ouija Board"" which does not apppear on his new DVD compilation. There's no telling when Mozzer will return with a new CD (at the time of this writing, he has no record contract on either side of the Atlantic), but until then, fans new and old should go out of their way to pick up this winner.",1000857600,,577,4.351851851851852
7824803,5,6302374030,"Finally found this vid... lost my copy years ago which was v annoying as I'm in the video!!!.. the live stuff was filmed at Wolverhampton Civic Hall (nr Birmingham UK).. queued for about 9 hrs to get in, the gig was free is you wore a Smiths t-shirt.  Can't rememeber which tune it is, but the camera zooms right in on my face.. my only claim to fame.. apart from touching Morrissey's foot during the performance!!... outstanding stuff...",996624000,5,438,4.615384615384615
7824804,5,6302374030,"This is an all too short compilation of the Moz's videos.  There is also excerpts of some very enthusiastic concert-goers.
A must for any Morrissey fan.  His visuals are as complex as his lyrics and are quite  stimulating and often very funny!",953251200,3,243,4.738095238095238
7824805,4,6302374030,"The Smith's were one of the 80's most provocative bands. Steve Morrisey's departure into solo proves both musically powerful and visually appealing. Morrisey's ""Hulmerist"" is indeed fun to watch.
Favorite  Morrisey songs such as ""Last of the International Playboys,""  ""Ouija Board,"" and ""Interesting Drug"" are on here. They  show Morrisey much the romantic that is not readily evident on his music.  Too, his selection of Directors is quite noteworthy. Unlike the modern  glamourboy images so prevelent on MTV, Morrisey looks very common as his  followers. The fan footage, though sometimes drawn-out, shows his appeal in  the UK.
Clearly this video is an excellent buy for those who enjoyed  Morrisey's earlier solo days. What better than to see it on your TV!",931132800,9,761,5.231404958677686
