8486194,1,B001CUBBY6,"there wasn't anything too informative in this 10 min clip of how art therapy was used. my sister purchased this for me as a gift and i felt bad that she spent the money on this dvd rather than on an art therapy book. i wouldn't recommend this product. you watch it once (for 10 minutes), and you probably won't watch it again. you honestly will probably forget that you even have it. just saying. do you really need another dvd case in your home, especially if the film is 10 minutes long?
