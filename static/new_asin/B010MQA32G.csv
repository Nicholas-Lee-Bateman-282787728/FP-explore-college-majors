8722696,5,B010MQA32G,"Is Barack Obama right?  Is America truly no longer a Christian nation?  Or worse yet, do the majority of Americans not understand what real Christianity is?

Brandon McGuire has produced and directed a masterful apologetic for Christianity by mingling interviews with Christian Scholars and ordinary people, some claiming to be Christian, most who have no true understanding of this faith and message.

Cameos by noted Christian thinkers, leaders in their academic fields, and pastors from throughout America, dissect the reality of what Christianity is not versus what it truly is meant to be.  Lee Strobel is dangled on the jacket, making the obligatory appearance on camera, undoubtedly to woo audiences into checking out the film.  But, amazingly, he becomes only one of a myriad of intellectual stalwarts easily crafting the validity of the only true religion on earth.

A sleeper of a film, in other words a quality work that does not rocket into prominence, Mining for God marvelously takes one into the Himalayas of theology to confront a major Hillary Step of American religious thought. {Intriguingly a timely pun surfaces without aforethought.} That step is the false presentation of Jesus and Christianity.

Hopefully this is  the premier of McGuire's work.  Apples of Gold in frames of Silver.

I have many case for Christianity dvds and although this one incorporates some apologetics, it focus is on what Christianity is and how people in the US view it. Great interviews from experts in Christianity and from people in general. Wish the documentary was longer with more interviews from people on the street.",1439078400,4,343,5.035087719298246
