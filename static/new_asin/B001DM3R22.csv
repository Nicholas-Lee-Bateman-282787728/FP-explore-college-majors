Nobody ever forgets their ""first love,"" and this movie is a cross between ""The Ugly Duckling"" and ""Cinderella.""  The DVDs play well; the translations are a little rough (as usual), but an excellent movie at an excellent price and delivered to your door.  It is a favorite.  Unfortunately, it is Choi, Jin-Sil's last movie - she left us much too early.",1405641600,2,443,4.776315789473684
8294106,3,B001DM3R22,"Twenty plus years of Hallyu Korean dramas circling the globe, getting their tormentors to drink the Kool Aid - why?  Because the Japanese filmed the Comfort Women assaults.

This ""last scandal"" is so unbelievable in what the middle aged single mother does with no embarassment that it is suspicious and as the fourth Kdrama viewed in succession recently, it can't be a coincidence that Kdramas make a point of their male leads having to stand up for the female leads against society.  We don't have that in America and its not in Chinese cinema where both males and females get the short end of the stick.  It's really NOT a thing in America the way it is in Korea - not even Cinderella needs her Prince to fight her battles - they just solve their problems.  There has to be a reason that the Koreans have been selling this to the world.

Korean dramas are selling affection and it is only addictive to a select group.

It's interesting that this 2008 drama could be an alternative reality for Popular in Japan Bae Yung Joon.  It does not make any sense that someone like that is still single in a country famous for its high mountains and beautiful women and if he did lose his idol status with a revelation of a long marriage and children, he could always fall back on the older brother's character of having a successful entertainment company.",1381449600,,1347,4.560165975103734
