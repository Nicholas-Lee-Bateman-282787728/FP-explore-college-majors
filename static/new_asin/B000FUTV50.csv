I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT, A PERSON WITH DELSIONS AND SOMEWHAT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN GOES OUT OF HIS WAY ON BECOMING HIS OWN DEMON AND WHAT HE WAS ORIGINALLY AFRAID OF IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILM!  A MUST SEE!!",1381881600,2,309,4.049180327868853
2590806,5,B000FUTV50,"there is a part in this movie that still give me chills to see and even to think about. it is mesmerizing in the creepy feeling, and really get you thinking - spellbinding is the word! worth every minute of viewing time, too.",1361404800,,225,4.255813953488372
2590807,5,B000FUTV50,"Okay, THE UNINVITED GUEST (EL HABITANTE INCIERTO) is one weird movie! It's certainly NOT your typical, Hollywood thriller. I sometimes wonder if America has forgotten how to make different, interesting movies. Anyway, this film is a grand example of taking a fairly typical premise- ""There's a lurker somewhere in my house!""-  and turning it upside down, and inside out! I thought I had everything figured out a couple of times, and although I hit some points, I was twisted and flipped right along w/ the plot! Also, the ""hero"" of the story, is an emotional wreck / wimpy guy (Not exactly Jason Bourne in house-pants if you catch my drift!). This added to the suspense, since it made him more vulnerable and apt to mess things up. So, if you like crazy thrillers that don't answer every question in prefabricated style, then invite this GUEST in for the evening...",1356652800,2,865,4.805369127516778
2590808,5,B000FUTV50,"""The Uninvited Guest"" is one of the most tension-filled films I've ever seen. Riveting, well-acted and suspenseful, this film will truly leave you breathless - and maybe scratching your head. If you want to indulge in a movie that will make you cringe strictly from the dram of it all, this is it. Highly recommended.",1267660800,3,317,4.781818181818182
2590809,3,B000FUTV50,"The problem with this movie is it could have been written better. The hyper-expository monologues Claudia dishes out are so unrealistic I laughed. It's a sign of a director in trouble when he has to give lines to a character, for the sake of the audience, that can't be delivered organically by that character. Those plot-getting-in-the-way-of-the-story lines polluted an otherwise poetic, dream like, and metaphorical film. It's a beautiful essay on loneliness.

I would never call this film ""Lynchy"" ... which is just shorthand for ""I don't get it but I liked it anyway ... I think. Didn't I? Did you?"" David Lynch's films can be difficult. This film is just a beta release, ya know, like everything from google.

Hence, the sudden remake. El Habitante incierto is a brilliantly conceived film that should have been executed better so the director is taking a mulligan. That's cool. I look forward to it and hope he does a better job explaining Vera's sudden muteness upon being shot in the plot hole we all saw coming like an eighteen wheeler.

OK. She was shot in the mouth and it just took a couple days without food or water for her to get her voice back at film's end. Yeah, that's it.

I give the first half a 9, the second half a 5. Let's call it a 7 and anxiously await the do-over. It's a lovely film to look at and it frustrated me so much I'm going to watch it again and again until version 2 comes along.",1220054400,,1418,4.505836575875486
2590810,4,B000FUTV50,"For some reason while I was viewing this movie, I kept thinking of Hitchcock's *Rear Window*.  The plots between the two are nothing similar, it's just the paranoia that runs throughout the movie.

*El Habitante Incierto* revolves around Felix who lives in a house too big for one person.  He's down because his girlfriend has left him, yet her things are still stored at his place.  They just have a really odd relationship.

One stormy night (how cliche is that!), a stranger knocks on Felix' door to use the telephone.  Felix allows him in and leaves him alone for his phone call.  When he returns, the stranger is no longer there.  Did the stranger leave?  Or is he hiding in the house?  Felix, upon hearing strange noises, believes that the stranger is hiding in the house.

Felix becomes so paranoid that he just cannot stay inside.  In an interesting twist, he becomes the stranger.

Overall, it was a good classic type of suspense that Hitchcock fans would love to watch.  There are some parts, towards the end, that were left open.  Therefore, questions that I had throughout the movie were left unanswered.  Nonetheless, quite enjoyable.",1183593600,5,1147,4.805128205128205
8126977,2,B000FUTV50,"The film starts off very promising when our lead Felix believes that a stranger who asked to use his phone, may be hiding somewhere in his 4,000 square foot home. The first half of the film works really well here when dealing with the paranoia of a potential uninvited guest lurking around, and the emotional impact of a separation. Felix and Vera have split up but remained friends. Is Felix sudden loneliness causing him to lose his mind, or is the stranger really lurking about in his house?

Unfortunately, the film completely falls apart when Felix leaves his own house after he thinks he shot the stranger, leaving him locked in his house to die. The film takes a dive when Felix now becomes the unwanted guest in his neighbors house. What started out riveting prior to this, falls into tediousness, stupidity, confusion, ridiculousness, and redundancy. Its like two films in one where the first half is great and the second, awful. The cast is very capable and I really liked watching sexy Andoni Gracia give a great performance. Sadly this would have been a great film had it not strayed from its original focus. Ending was predictable and disappointing, and I love my foreign films :(",1516060800,,1193,4.763285024154589

8126982,3,B000FUTV50,"I told myself that I will not rate this film, for I do not understand the plot.
That is why my rating is so low.

The Uninvited Guest (2004) is a Spanish psychological-drama-thriller with a very convulsive and complicated plot.
At time the film looks like Latin soap opera.

The entire movie takes place in one large house, where the main character Martin is living/hiding/acting strange.
I am not going to explain the film, because I do not know how to. I really did not get it.  All I can say is that this is one of those
artsy-psychological movies where the viewer needs multiple viewings before tying all the loose ends and grasping the movie.
The movie is 109 minutes long and there is a lot happening.  I felt like I was watching two movies in one, with underlying stories.
Also, I could not help but realize that the main character (SPOLIER*SPOLIER*SPOLIER*) is suffering from some sort of mental illness like
schizophrenia or bipolar disease.  I guess that will be all. It is not a bad movie, by all means it is an interesting film, but it is easy to get lost in the plot. Viewers beware !!!!!! NOT AN EASY FILM TO UNDERSTAND.",1420588800,,1134,4.512195121951219
8126983,4,B000FUTV50,"(El Habitante Incierto) THe Uninvited Guest is a 2004 Spanish thriller with enough twists and psychological rabbit holes that it will keep you riveted. At times. the film borders on a voyeuristic sojourn but manages to still be stylish. Creep and engrossing, this is the tale of Felix, an emotionally fragile architect (Andoni Gracia) who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Vera (Monica Lopez). Felix's attempts to have Vera return are overshadowed when he allows a stranger (martin) use his house phone due to an emergency. Soon after, noises and other unexplained occurrences are noticed by Felix. Soon, Felix is convinced that there is a lurker somewhere in his self-designed huge house..The plot becomes more complicated when Felix is required to go to the local police due to an accident. There he sees a woman (Claudia who is also played by Ms. Lopez).  Soon her and his life become entangled as felix becomes the intruder into someone else's life. It turns out her husband is missing. The plot twists, the vulnerable hero (Felix) and the eroticism of the movie add to the suspense of this well-made film. So, if stylish, sexy thrillers are your thing this is a great example of that genre.",1414540800,,1201,4.887254901960785
8126984,4,B000FUTV50,"Here's an odd little film. At times The Uninvited Guest seems to be made up of two separate movies glued together somewhere near the middle.  The Uninvited Guest is spooky, compelling, suspenseful, funny, voyeuristic and tragic.

The Uninvited Guest boasts a very good script (except for two of three plot points) and two great performances by the leads.

The plot: A wimpy architect who fears being alone is terrified that someone is secretly living in his house with him.  His x-wife thinks he is nuts.  I can't tell more then that without spoiling this twisty little dark comedy that Alfred Hitchcock would have loved.  I will say that this film changes direction more then once in some very unexpected ways. Don't get the idea that you know where this one is going.

The only problem with this film is the same one that I find with many thrillers these days - The Uninvited Guest has at least one glaring plot hole and a few things things that don't add up. - these could have been patched up easy enough. Why so many filmmakers leave their films this way is beyond me but The Uninvited Guest is no different.

My final thought on The Uninvited Guest is: If you are a bit forgiving and suspend your disbelief a bit and enjoy films like Psycho,  Rear Window, Vertigo  or just about anything from the Alfred Hitchcock hour then I think you will get a kick out of this little Spanish thriller.",1393632000,,1394,4.562248995983936
8126985,5,B000FUTV50,"Absolutely incredible film. Thoughtful and thought-provoking. Artfully done and yet wholly authentic feeling. The tension is palpable. The protagonists confusion spreads to the viewer. His role reversal is surprisingly touching and yet violently sick. Somehow we experience genuine joy, dark humor, personal drama, tragedy, love, and deepest paranoia within almost every scene. Im almost confounded as to how Morales could weave all these elements into a single, cohesive tapestry. This film may not be for everyone. You must be comfortable losing your grip on reality a bit. You must be willing to shift your allegiances for characters, then shift them back.

I bore with how easily the term Hitchcockian is thrown about. Any film with a twist or sense of mood gets crowned with the word. This is one of the few films Ive experienced in the last decade that truly deserve that honor. Award-deserving directing and acting.",1391472000,,922,5.22972972972973
8126986,1,B000FUTV50,"This film is a mess. It starts out well enough, promising to be a good psychological ride, but falls apart entirely at the end. There is absolutely no way to describe ANY of the things that happened to bring about the end as it was. In stories of any sort, suspension of disbelief only goes so far. This movie crosses this line without even hesitating. As they say, in fiction you can tell one lie, but everything else must follow logically from there. You can't add lie upon lie just to bring the story together. That leads to rubbish like this picture. Essentially, the author/director seems to have just given up at the end. leaving us 100 minutes of our lives wasted.",1383177600,,671,4.508196721311475
