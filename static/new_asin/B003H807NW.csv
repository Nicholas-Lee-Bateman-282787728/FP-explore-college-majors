All I take back from the movie is a nude chick walking around constantly and weird people/images.  I guess if you had one too many LSD hits, you might actually know what is going on here, otherwise a normal non-drugged person would just scratch their head and go WTF?

Good Luck....Id suggest renting as I did, rather than buying this tripe.",1335916800,2,456,4.469879518072289
4124018,4,B003H807NW,"Okay, so this film contains actresses of a certain, ahem, age. Mature women. I'm a mature man, so it works for me!

It's quirky, with a lot of not so subtle cinemagraphic techniques, but what would you expect?

What I didn't expect was the ending. What a GREAT twist!

Yeah, the dialogue is lame, but there's enough T&A to keep your attention. And it's all so surreal. My favorite, non-exploitation movie is The Magus. This may become my favorite T&A movie.

Stick with it 'til the end.

Jim obviously didn't get it.",1335657600,4,516,4.565217391304348
4124019,3,B003H807NW,"This movie is just what it appears to be: a really low budget horror movie with quite a bit of nudity.  I really liked the main character: she was pretty; she rarely wore clothes, and when she did it wasn't many clothes (she even did a video blog in her underwear); and she didn't talk much, at least for the first half of the film.  I did find it a bit odd that she dreamed of herself naked; but then, I fell asleep for part of the movie, so it might have been me who was dreaming of her naked...

At any rate, if you like a movie with attractive women who are undressed for about a third of the movie, half-dressed for another third, and scantily-dressed for the remaining third, and don't mind mediocre acting, long stretches of no dialog, and weird camera effects that ""simulate"" dreaming, then this might be a good rental for you.

Near the end, it got a little Blair Witch / Everwood-y when she took her video camera on the road, and it almost pulled a plot out of its (naked) a$$.  Almost.  At least, if you don't think too hard, the ending let's you feel like you've just seen a movie and not just a random bunch of clips of a woman dreaming about herself (and other women) naked.  But an hour later, you realize that's all it really was.

So, just like I said: this movie is exactly what it appears to be.  If 1 star is the lowest you can give a movie, then this is probably a 2-star movie.  I gave it an extra star for honesty in advertising.  And when I hover over that third star, the little pop-up says ""it's OK"", which I think is an accurate description.",1322265600,25,1568,4.193333333333333

8396795,4,B003H807NW,"This movie is a witch thing.  Not much horror in the story is expected.  Instead, much semi-nakedness is what this movie is about.
For those enjoying to see half naked women in and out, this movie gives satisfaction.  Art, not porno.",1377561600,,233,4.634146341463414
8396796,5,B003H807NW,"I enjoyed the surreal nature of this film. It's a sort of nightmare meets reality type affair - it makes me think about the interface between imagination and reality. The idea of knowing we're gradually losing our sanity, and what we'd need to face in order to get our minds back. Really, it's an experience that is as deep or shallow as you want to it be. But, I enjoyed this movie so much, I bought it on DVD after I paid to rent it.

I acknowledge that it's far from perfect and likely won't win any awards in any category. But, some things just click on a personal level. It's five-stars to me, but it's not beyond criticism. Yes, it could perhaps be more coherent for example. But, who knows what would be lost if it was a ""perfect"" movie constrained by a low budget. The last minutes of the film could be more interesting; it felt almost rushed to flesh out the plot that was stark in the body of the film.

All in all, I'm impressed with this one. It's fun with some nice bizarre imagery. I just don't find many b-horror movies that take the chances this one does.",1375574400,,1071,4.270935960591133

8396798,4,B003H807NW,"When I rented this, I was just looking for nudity.  Well, I got that along with a surprise.  This movie fascinated me in a really strange way.  This woman goes through these strange nightmares and she tries to figure out the roots of them.  Note that the nightmares are very graphic and this is not a movie for anybody, but this film demands the attention of the viewer, I was wondering if I would get bored while watching it; I couldn't take my eyes off of this movie.  This movie is interesting, I can't explain why it's interesting, but it is.  The woman is naked throughout the movie, which makes it enjoyable, but I was surprised at how intriguing the movie actually was.",1361750400,,676,4.455284552845528
8396799,1,B003H807NW,"This has to qualify as one of the worse films I have ever watched. What was it? It appeared to be a bunch of bad, ugly scenes, pasted together to give the lead a chance to show off her attributes. The sloppy visuals were accompanied by poor sound and poor to non-existing dialog. Time and money were wasted on this one.",1348099200,,319,4.245901639344262
8396800,4,B003H807NW,"This is an interesting and sexy horror movie the likes of which you don't see very often. The main actress Angela Tropea is a beautiful blonde who walks around naked for the majority of the movie in a nightmarish dreamscape filled with perilous horrors and eerie characters who hardly say a word. In fact there is very little dialog in the entire movie save for a few sequences with the woman on webcam. This is the kind of movie you watch when you're too tired to deal with convoluted plots and just want to see nudity and horror in their purest forms. It's a nightmare phantasia on a micro budget that succeeds in its quest to entertain and it's never boring. Eerie music always lingers in the background and all of the dreamworld scenes were shot at night lending a foreboding aspect of 'never ending night' to the proceedings. Strange fetishistic touches abound as well as interesting, bizarre symbolism. It all builds to a satisfying climax (no pun intended) with the beautiful naked blonde facing off with an S&M version of herself as secrets are revealed and 'all hell breaks loose'. Carlo Rodriguez is an interesting, stylistic and very capable director who simply needs a bigger budget to work with. Horror fans take note: so far all of this director's movies have hit their marks and he never engages in false advertising. His movies are exactly what you expect but always with a little extra thrown in. I predict that his best work is yet to come and eagerly look forward to seeing each new movie he directs.",1347667200,4,1519,4.6716417910447765
8396801,4,B003H807NW,"It's a strange movie but I loved it. Angela Tropea is very good and very easy on the eyes, and yes she's naked and shows a lot of skin. She doesn't say alot in first part of the movie and she does a good job of showing her emotions thru her expressions and body language. Hope to see her in more.",1337990400,4,296,3.8688524590163933
