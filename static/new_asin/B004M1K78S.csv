FILM FACT Part Two: THE INCREDIBLES is the first PIXAR film to be scored by Michael Giacchino. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's design and the future as seen from the 1960's. John Barry was the first choice to do the film's score, with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of John Barry's theme to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However, John Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks; the assignment was instead given to Michael Giacchino.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In 2004, I took myself to see THE INCREDIBLES, because I am a massive fan of PIXAR animation and especially of Brad Bird's previous animated features. Even with such high hopes, The Incredibles managed to exceed all of my expectations. I watched it with a mixture of awe and unbridled glee. So enraptured was I, that I even sat through all of the closing end credits.

The film's title is the name of a family of superheroes who are forced to hide their powers and live a quiet suburban life. Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a battle with an evil villain and his killer robot. Bob Paar used to be one of the world's greatest superheroes, known to all as ""Mr. Incredible,"" saving lives and fighting evil on a daily basis. But now, 15 years later, Bob and his wife, a famous former superhero in her own right, have adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids. Now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top secret assignment.

Some seven years and multiple viewings later, and THE INCREDIBLES have lost none of its considerable lustre. It still manages to shock, surprise, thrill, delight, and even inspires a tear or two. It's the best superhero or ""comic book"" movie there is, despite not being based on any specific property. It is a cinematic funhouse, picking and choosing the best bits from a variety of pop culture sources and giving each piece its own specific spin. Brad Bird's masterpiece is proof that a special-effects animation film can be artistically and visually astounding without having to sacrifice the story. Even in the PIXAR canon, THE INCREDIBLES stands apart. There is nothing else like it.

The plot summary for those who need it: Once upon a time, America's streets were kept safe by superheroes in colourful costumes. Chief among them were Mr. Incredible [Craig T. Nelson] and Elastigirl [Holly Hunter], an adventuring duo who may have fought crime on their own, but who fell in love and married and tackled the adventure of life together. Eventually, however, the public turned against its costumed do-gooders and super heroics were outlawed. The caped and non-caped crusaders alike were relocated a la witness protection and given normal lives. Mr. and Mrs. Incredible became Bob and Helen Parr. He worked in insurance, she became a homemaker, and they had three kids: Violet [Sarah Vowel], Dash [Sebastian Fox], and baby Jack-Jack. The eldest kids develop superpowers, especially with Violet can turn invisible, Dash can run fast, but they must act like a normal family. This bores Bob to death.

Enter the mysterious and sexy Mirage [Elizabeth Pena], who offers Mr. Incredible a chance to don his tights again and perform covert operations for an unseen benefactor. Bob jumps at the opportunity, unaware that the benefactor is a former fan [Jason Lee] who he once offended. This deranged kid has taken to calling himself Syndrome, and he's been killing supers while perfecting the inventions that will make him the greatest ""hero"" of all time and allow him to get his revenge on the man who rejected him. Bob's disappearance draws his wife out of retirement, the kids stow along, and before you can say ""shazam"" THE INCREDIBLES are a genuine super-team, a crime-fighting family like no other.

As far as computer animation goes in general, PIXAR specifically has advanced in the seven years since THE INCREDIBLES was first released; it is still amazing to see how far ahead of their competitors studios was when THE INCREDIBLES came out. This is the level at which most other animation outfits are operating at today, if they are lucky and even if their tech is up to the job, their art department has nowhere near the attention to detail that PIXAR's does. There isn't an inch of any single frame of THE INCREDIBLES that hasn't been carefully considered. The illusion is airtight.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Blu-Ray release of THE INCREDIBLES Limited Edition Steelbook gets it right straight out of the gate. PIXAR gives us a stunning 1080p encoded image with and aspect ratio 2.39:1 presentation that is gorgeous, enhancing the original vision of the Pixar animators by giving it a format that is worthy of their technological achievement. It's practically as if they have been waiting for the delivery system that would catch up with what they are delivering. The image resolution on THE INCREDIBLES is as close to perfect as you are likely to get. Minor details are given a new boost in clarity, you will notice sparkle and dust and other finely rendered touches that you probably didn't even see in cinemas or on the previous inferior NTSC DVD. Colours pack a lot of punch, including a proper distinction between hot and cold, literally. Compare the lava of Syndrome's lair to Frozone's ice slides, and see how they glow in entirely different ways. Also look at the individual embers and icicles. You can really see how this movie is animated on a near-molecular level. Other fine details are hair, water, expression; get their due, as well. The Incredibles simply looks totally marvellous and stunning.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  A newly created 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix on the original soundtrack also pulls more out of The Incredibles. The film fills all the speakers, creating an entirely immersive atmosphere, complete with between-speaker effects on all levels of the audio and music, and dialogue. Subtle details ping between channels while the big moments boom with the full force of the entire system. Ambience prevails at all times, acoustics are convincing, and directionality is wonderfully precise. Simply put, everything from the track's arresting dynamics to its extraordinary immersive is as flawless and faithful as PIXAR purists have come to expect from the surround audio mixes. THE INCREDIBLES deserves to be turned up extremely loud.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary from Producer John Walker and Director Brand Bird: With is audio commentary you have the film Director Brad Bird and producer John Walker dig into the heroes and villains, their powers and world, the on-screen action and quieter character beats, the voice casting process and subsequent performances, the animation and stylistic flourishes, and much, much more.

Plus Animators Gini Santos, David Devan, Kureha Yokoo, David Mullins, John Kahrs, Robert Russ, Angua MacLane, Travis Hathaway, Doug Frankel and Peter Sohn. Thankfully, the two groups, the supervising animators and the animators have been recorded in separate sessions and the track's editor does a fine job keeping things from getting too unwieldy. It's next to impossible to decipher who's speaking during the animators' segments, but it hardly matters. Their chemistry shines through and prevents listener frustration.

Special Feature: Boundin' [2003] [4:40] [Optional Visual Commentary] A sheep dances proudly in his southwestern landscape, until one day his wool is sheared and he is left naked. He's depressed and shy, until a cheerful jackalope comes along and shows him how to leap proudly and not to be ashamed.

Special Feature: Jack-Jack Attack [2005] [4:42] PIXAR Animation Studios short showing us what baby Jack-Jack was up to with his baby sitter while his parents and siblings were off on their own adventure.

Their jokes and jabs are fierce and even more funnier anecdotes, the rare insights they provide into the film, its story and its characters are invaluable, and their exceedingly candid reflection on the development and production of one of PIXAR's finest makes this one of the few extras even the most anti-supplement purists will enjoy watching. Whatever you do, don't miss this one.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: Gary's Birthday [1:24] ""Gary is every man"" in this amusing story told by the team who tried to maintain their sanity while working on Brad Bird's superhero epic.

Finally, this is the first CGI animated film to feature an all-human cast. PIXAR's THE INCREDIBLES is absolutely terrific look at the humdrum of suburban middle-aged life. The story comes with a wonderfully memorable cast of characters and tons of explosive action that will knock your socks off, making this a unique and highly entertaining family flick with smarts. The Blu-ray boasts remarkable, demo-quality video and audio, and an extensive collection of bonus material. If ever a animation film's title was fitting as a description of the overall package, this is most definitely it. This Blu-ray truly is incredible. A must own release for sure! Needless to say, I simply can't think of a single reason THE INCREDIBLES shouldn't earn a coveted place in your Blu-ray collection and that is why I am so proud to add this to my ever expanding Blu-ray PIXAR Collection and especially in my ever growing Limited Edition SteelBook Collection. Very Highly Recommended!
