5963759,3,B00F2IYPJW,I love just about anything Fr. Barron does. The Catholicism series really knocked it out of the park. I guess that's why I was so disappointed with this set. The first disc was the presentation and the next 3 discs just seems like bonus material. I am not sure why there needed to be 3 more discs when most of the interviews that are on the other 3 are mostly in the actual feature. I guess I was expecting the kind of format from the Catholicism series. I also agree with the previous poster who said there weren't many expert interviews from women. Helen Alvare or Kim Daniels would have been a good ones to interview.,1380758400,28,620,4.353448275862069
5963760,4,B00F2IYPJW,"Catholicism: The New Evangelization is the latest installment from Word on Fire studies and Fr. Barron. Before we talk about what this series is, let's quickly talk about what it isn't. Firstly, it isn't a sequel to the Catholicism series. Secondly, it isn't an intense ten lesson study like its predecessor. Lastly, it is not merely Fr. Barron talking in front of a camera. Then, what is this series? This series is a call to action; a call to go forth and spread the good news of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection. Yes, Fr. Barron does a great deal of the talking like before, but he also includes key proponents of the New Evangelization, like Brandon Vogt or George Weigel, to share in this presentation.

Disc One is the main program or ""Feature Presentation"" of this four disc set. In this 95 minute video, Fr. Barron focuses primarily on society and the growing secularism, atheism, and agnosticism of the population. While it would be easy to take a defeated or pessimistic attitude toward this growing trend, Fr. Barron has an air of optimism because he knows the Truth and wants to share that Truth with everyone. Also in this disc, Fr. Barron gives a brief overview of what the New Evangelization is. He explains to the audience that the New Evangelization is only new in its presentation. The message, however, has remained unchanged since the first century.

The next two discs include interviews by four key speakers - Brad Gregory, George Weigl, Ross Douthat, and Brandon Vogt. The interviews proved to be interesting, and I believe each speaker has potential to reach a different audience. I wish, however, that there would have been a woman interviewed. Failing to do so seems to add fuel to the fire that the Catholic Church is a man's world. The final disc contains two talks by Fr. Barron. He truly is a priest who loves Jesus, and you can hear that in his charisma and dynamic presentations.

Overall, this was a very good program, which contained a lot of information about what the New Evangelization is. My one gripe is that the Feature Presentation, did not give advice or tips on how to evangelize. Fr. Barron did give seven qualities of a New Evangelist in one of his additional segments on Disc Two, which were helpful. However, I'm sure there are others like me who would like concrete ideas or suggestions on what to do or where to start. Perhaps these were included in the Study Guide, which I do not yet own. That gripe aside, this is still a fascinating program that you will enjoy and want to share with your friends or parish.",1379808000,64,2561,4.674057649667406
5963761,4,B00F2IYPJW,"This DVD shows how few Catholics are attending masses and how one diocese in Australia, after world youth day with the Pope, has changed everything there. Teens are working at getting their parents to go back to the mass (the food for our souls). I found this DVD inspiring, and uplifting. So much good has come out of this one event, we could all use as a tool to emulate in our communities.",1398988800,2,392,4.383561643835616
5963762,5,B00F2IYPJW,"The Catholicism Series taught you who Jesus is and the beauty of being a member of His body, the Catholic Church.  The follow-up material will teach you why and how to share that truth, beauty, and goodness with others.",1398470400,6,219,4.615384615384615
5963763,3,B00F2IYPJW,"Robert Barron is wonderful, but do not be mislead by this series.  Catholicism is a fantastic series with scenes from around the world. This series is more like interviews and not very engaging and quite dull.  It is drawn out and does not bring the viewer into it.  I hope the next series will do justice.  This series is still rich in the Catholic faith, just not as expected.  I still have yet to make it all the way through.  Catholicism was so great that I watched it continually.  If you have patience and time to stop and come back to watch this it might be for you.  The information I have see so far has been wonderful just not engaging at all.",1395964800,5,653,4.252032520325203
5963764,3,B00F2IYPJW,"I guess I was spoiled by Fr. Barron's first dvd series ""Catholicism"".  I found this ""okay"" but no where near as good as his ""Catholicism"" dvd series.  I understand Fr. Barron is in the process of producing a new series on the Church Fathers which I am very much looking forward to.",1393718400,3,281,4.384615384615385
5963765,5,B00F2IYPJW,Rev. Robert E. Barron is simply outstanding.  He presents everything is such an easy to understand way.  I would recommend this to all.,1390003200,,135,4.826086956521739
5963766,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I am 70 year old and have been Catholic since I was 7.  I promise you, this is the very best presentation I have ever seen in all my many years. Father Barron is an extraordinary theologian and spokesperson for the church and does a wonderful job on this series.  If you ever wonder if you have missed any part of the function and reasons of the church and Catholicism itself, as I did, than this will help you immensely.  I have watched it eleven times to date...with many of my family members and always enjoy it.  Please do see it if you can. Best wishes to Father Barron and the Word on Fire...",1389312000,,598,4.219298245614035
5963767,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Father Barron is amazing at explaining difficult philosophical and theological concepts. He really brings the faith to live in an intellectual way that is contagious. It has deepened my understanding of the faith, and has peeked my curiosity to explore more of it. The entire ""Catholicism"" series is beautiful to watch and really shows how global the Catholic religion is. Would highly recommend it!",1389139200,,399,5.25
5963768,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Our parish aired this series as an advent retreat last year.  WOW.  It is so powerful, we wanted to watch it over and over just to catch everything. I have since listened to some of Fa. Barron's other CD's on various topics and have found myself stopping them often, just to really take in all he's saying, so power-packed they are!  Thanks to Fa. Barron for not flinching when called to light a candle in the darkness!",1389139200,,419,4.415584415584416
5963769,5,B00F2IYPJW,Another excellent well thought out series from Father Barron which is informative but never dull.  His joy and enthusiasm for the faith are clear to see and the excellent presentation reflects his desire to share his knowledge and experience with others.  Most highly recommended.,1389139200,,280,5.340909090909091
5963770,5,B00F2IYPJW,wonderful films help catholics and non catholics understand the church.  please continue to make these informative films for all the people.,1389139200,,140,5.666666666666667
5963771,5,B00F2IYPJW,"We like to position ourselves well in life. To be on the winning team. The program demonstrates that Catholicism is the best place to be. That we are in the company of the best people. That it is the winning team and that we can  enter the great debates in an intellectually challenging way. I didn't know about Theology on Tap,i.e. that young people can meet to discuss Jesus in  the most unlikely places e.g a pub. That the best evangelisers of young people are other young people.",1389052800,,483,4.4772727272727275
5963772,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I have viewed this DVD, as well as the additional interviews. I am currently facilitating the study at my church. I think this is very well done, and is a call to action! I believe we all have our own style, and at the very least, we can evangelize by how we live our lives! I think it is imperative for us to reach out to our young adults, who are very important to the future of our Church. The current age of social media is a blessing and a curse, but if we become more educated about our faith and can articulate the truths of the Catholic Church, then evangelizing becomes a more natural part of our everyday lives. We should be as comfortable about posting things on Facebook and Twitter about our faith as everything else...I believe if we all realize that there is a communion of faithful ""out there"", then maybe it will seem more socially ""acceptable"" to speak up and speak out for our Church Traditions! This course empowers me to do just that!

5963773,5,B00F2IYPJW,"After the beautiful, brilliant and eloquent Catholicism series, the New Evangelization seems like a natural transition ... from defining our faith to sharing it as commanded in the Great Commission.  A thorough analysis of evangelization as it stands - to why it is needed - to groundbreaking new approaches, it shows that the need for people to know Christ is as necessary now as it was 2,000 years ago.  The means have changed, the need for God has not.  As it stated, we are created, wired for God, and are searching until we find Him.

It was wonderful to see young people enthused and excited about God, rather than feverishly pursuing drugs, drink and worldly ambitions.  The radiance on their faces as they spoke of their faith was nothing short of lovely to behold.  I loved the focus on evangelizing the young and those on the margins.  The various interviews were enlightening.  Father Barron's narration was delivered with his usual clarity, directness and a quiet passion.  I would recommend this series for those who are constantly seeking to grow in the knowledge of Christ.",1389052800,2,1088,4.869565217391305
5963774,5,B00F2IYPJW,Loved this series as much as the Catholicism series.  Well presented and very thought provoking. Workbook will be a part of parish program and parish opportunity.,1389052800,,162,5.230769230769231
5963775,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I love it!  I am now watching them over and getting more the second time around.  I am grieving the loss of my sister just 5 months ago.  Watching this series pulls me out of a slump and makes me think of God's great big tapestry, that just doesn't make sense to me from this side, but it will when I see it from the other side.

Thank you Father Barron!",1389052800,2,354,3.943661971830986
5963776,5,B00F2IYPJW,I purchased the Catholicism series as a way to re-energize my Catholic identity and was not disappointed.  So when the new program was released I was delighted.  Catholicism The New Evangelization is very well done and much needed in today's culture.  Fr. Barron continues to offer thoughtful and insightful commentary on the Church in the world and I'm much indebted to him and his team at Word on Fire for helping me keep my faith vital in my life and bringing the New Evangelization to others in my community.,1389052800,,512,4.730337078651686

5963780,5,B00F2IYPJW,"We cannot know everything about the Mysteries of our faith, yet Father Barron sheds much light so at least we can approach the Mystery with understanding.  His explanation of the Eucharist is compelling and well grounded and should clear up any confusion as to why Catholics believe in the true presence of Christ!",1388966400,,314,4.9245283018867925
5963781,5,B00F2IYPJW,This is a lovable way to learn to  share and to teach our beautiful catholic faith. The history not only of the church but the history were the church and the first Christians developed. I hope one day I can own my copy. Thanks to the people who produced it.,1388966400,,258,4.16
5963782,5,B00F2IYPJW,This is a great taste of what the world is facing now in the areas of evangelization.  The church needs good lay catholics who understand their faith and are not afraid to live it!,1388966400,,180,4.294117647058823
5963783,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Enjoyable and spiritually fulfilling.  Fr. Barron gets it right and feeds the flocks.  Reminds me of why I chose Catholicism - a joyful reminder of what it means to be Catholic and the work we are all called to do.  I recommend this for Catholics, historians and anyone looking for THE answer.",1388966400,,293,4.596153846153846
5963784,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron just may be this generation's Fulton J. Sheen.  His approachable manner makes this study both enlightening and understandable.  While still difficult to top his Catholicism series, this newest offering certainly shows the way the Catholic church is headed, and for the eternal betterment of mankind.",1388966400,,310,5.574468085106383
5963785,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron is one of the best evangelists of our time.  His knowledge of the Catholic faith is amazing. He makes you want to learn more about our faith.  If you are searching for a reason to come back to the faith, or simply just want to learn more about it, check this out!",1388966400,,274,4.055555555555555
5963786,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I really loved the way Fr. Barron presented and explained what this New Evangelization is about and how we fit into it! As usual, he is a stellar evangelist and presents the truth about the Church, while never backing off from those things people think but are either misguided about or too afraid to say.",1388966400,2,305,4.5636363636363635
5963787,5,B00F2IYPJW,"This is a beautifully put together, easy listening, world discovering overview of new movement of the faithful.  The only problem is it is over too soon!  Grab a cup of hot chocolate and pop this DVD in your player.  You just might want to let your atheist friends watch it with you - since they are part of the scene, too!",1388966400,3,323,4.262295081967213
5963788,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Robert Barron's ability to engage the modern culture with the joy of the Catholic faith in nothing less than awe-inspiring! In Catholicism: The New Evangelization, Fr. Barron confronts head on the obstacles many have in embracing the Catholic faith, from the New Atheism to moral relativism. Reading comments from his years of doing youtube videos has given him a unique understanding of what blocks many from embracing the faith. He taps into that with clarity, intelligence, and compassion. After watching this DVD, you will realize, as St. Augustine once said ""You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.""",1388966400,2,659,5.055045871559633
5963789,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fantastic! I have yet to walk away from anything that Word on Fire presents or from any interview I've watched featuring Fr Barron without having an ""a-ha!"" moment. These documentaries have made me even prouder to be Catholic!!!",1388966400,2,228,5.026315789473684

5963791,5,B00F2IYPJW,The new series on Catholicism is a great sequel to the last. This series hits at the heart of what the Church needs and what the laity must be convicted of. Fr. Barron continues to teach and present the faith in a way that anyone can learn from. I loved the first Catholicism series and I already love this one as well! God bless Fr. Barron and his ministry!,1388966400,,358,4.202898550724638
5963792,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I am absolutely blown away by the extraordinary beauty of this documentary.  Our parish, St. Ignatius of Loyola in Florida had shown it to the parishoners and there was a talk after each documentary, it was the most uplifting - inspiring - jaw dropping beautifully well-done documentary of our Catholic Church and our faith that I have ever seen. The music is outstanding, I had to order the CD so that I could play it whenever I wanted to. I loved it so much that I now listen to all of Father Baron's Podcasts and recommend them to everyone, most especially priests who are in need of inspiration for their homilies. The only disappointment I felt was at the end of each documentary, I did not want it to end. Father Barron is on Fire....the Holy Spirit is working through him.

5963793,5,B00F2IYPJW,A real documentary of the Catholic Faith. Will teach you and deepen your faith. Father Barron has a great way of explaining the faith.,1388966400,,134,4.625
5963794,5,B00F2IYPJW,I went through the series with a group and our Pastor summer before last.  It was the most awsome program I had ever encountered .Fr Barron is an excellent and interesting speaker and makes all the important and more difficult parts of our Catholic Faith so understanderable and down to earth.  The stories and the beautiful filming were so interesting and just awsome.  One wanted to be there too with him.  We were all saddened when it ended and would gladly have gone through it all over again.  He gave us much food for thought and meditation.  Thank you Fr. Robert Barron  for what you do for all the people that are interested more in the beautiful Catholic Faith.  God Bless You!,1388966400,,686,4.565573770491803
5963795,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron gives you many things to meditate and reflect on just like the Catholicism series.  If you like the Catholicism series, you will not be disappointed.  I was able to have a deeper understanding of my faith and a joy to spread the 'good news'.",1388966400,2,252,4.456521739130435
5963796,4,B00F2IYPJW,"I admire Fr. Barron very much, but was a little disappointed that he feels the ""older"" generation is out of touch and the youth today have so much more joy in their love for Christ.  Fr. Barron, could the wrongs of wars like WWII and the Cold War have possibly made those of us old enough to remember the lack of action by the church caused us to wonder if the church was really leading us in the right direction?  I am very glad that we currently have young people (and I am really not that old, around your age) to evangelize and get excited about the teachings of Jesus, God and salvation.  Socialism and Communism were quite a bit more rampant in years gone by, maybe replaced by what you call the ""whatever"" society today, but the church was an integral part of all of that at one time.  Our young people could learn a lot from the ""older"" generation, like having integrity and devotion despite all of the politics in the world.  The reality is that people are still dying due to political differences, the joy in our voices may not be the same, but our light is still burning.  I very much liked your Catholicism series, however.",1388966400,2,1135,4.380952380952381
5963797,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Everything Fr. Barron touches turns to gold! We always seem to hear about all the problems of the Church and rarely about the positive.  In this series, Fr. Barron sets out the reality of the situation and constructive ways to build up the Kingdom.

I highly recommend it for those fighting in the trenches for Jesus and his Church!",1388966400,,332,4.610169491525424

5963799,5,B00F2IYPJW,This was a beautifully done (literally - there are images of ancient art and beauty throughout) and very educational film.

Beautiful!!!,1388966400,,318,4.851851851851852
5963800,5,B00F2IYPJW,"This in a very accurate overview of the urgent need for us as true Catholics to Evangelize!! This is not rock science but a great visual reminder of the need for us to ""not  be afraid"" to go into the streets, our schools, our marketplaces, our society and proclaim the ""Joy of the Gospel"" like Pope Francis is doing. Our world desperately needs us to love and reach out to a very broken world that is spinning out of control daily! Like the late philosopher/theologian Francis Schaeffer said ""If there is no absolute by which to judge society, society is absolute""  Watch this video and set your heart on fire for the good news of the Gospel!",1388966400,6,642,4.478632478632479

5963807,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron is easily one of the most gifted speakers in the Catholic Church today, he speaks with clarity, authority, and plainly, yet while still conveying very complex ideas. He is a blessing to the Church, and Catholicism: The New Evangelization, along with ""Catholicism"" the 10 part series, will make an excellent addition to any believer or seeker's library.",1388966400,,363,5.169491525423729

5963809,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video from Fr Barron. It has the beautiful imagery of his world renown Catholicism series along with a very positive message, deep theological discussion and is a very good watch. I recommend it to everyone.

5963812,4,B00F2IYPJW,I have a feeling we may look back on this series as the start of something very special.  First the Catholicism series introduced the world to the Faith and now this documentary comes as a follow-up to show how the Gospel is being spread throughout the world!  I look forward to what comes next!  I pray that Catholics will have a greater and greater presence through the most accessible forms of media today!  This is a great start and I pray this trend continues!,1388966400,,465,4.5
5963813,5,B00F2IYPJW,"In his first video series, Catholicism, Fr. Barron brought to life the beauty and truth of the Catholic Faith. Now in his follow-up, Catholicism - The New Evangelization, he sounds the call for the Church to wake up and move beyond a passive, club membership faith, to an active evangelistic one so desperately needed in our times. Should be required viewing for all Catholics!",1388966400,,377,4.90625

5963815,4,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron is a very gifted speaker and filmmaker. At a time when society is growing increasingly hostile to the Christian faith and more self-destructive, Fr. Barron holds out hope and the joy that love for Jesus brings into our lives. As a cradle Catholic, this series inspires me to share my faith, look with hope to the future and to realize that there is a new generation coming up that is in desperate need of the Good News that is the Gospel! Word of Fire is doing great things for the Catholic Church!

My only criticism is that I would have like to see some more concrete suggestions on how we lay Catholics can better evangelize.",1388966400,,639,4.461538461538462
5963816,5,B00F2IYPJW,"I don't know about new evangelization vs old but I understand good evangelization vs bad. This outstanding film brings you around the world to see a new ardor, pride and joy in bringing the risen Christ to others. The youth and vitality of the witnesses are particularly moving. Chicagoans will recognize some familiar aspects like ""Theology on Tap"" in such far flung places as Australia.

The reason is the amazing job that Father Barron does putting the Catholic beliefs in the context of history and philosophy, which require no huge leaps of faith.  Not only are the messages inspiring, the production value of the series is second to none.  Great imagery and great inspiration.  Thank you, Fr. Barron!",1388966400,,436,4.931506849315069

5963829,5,B00F2IYPJW,Dr. Barron has done an excellent job portraying the situation in the world we're facing now. It was stated that one generation of uncatechized adults leads to the next generation being weak in faith. One generation after that is basically atheist. I am from Australia and can attest that it's mainly elderly you see at Church. There is the growing population of young people or families that don't feel the need for God. Dr. Barron shares how we're called to share our faith with joy and the perseverance that the Apostles had. Excellent work.,1388966400,,543,4.787234042553192

The seeds of JPII's new evangelization efforts are yielding glorious fruit in the form of articulate, thoughtful priests like Fr. Barron and the countless inspired young souls that are carrying Christ's message to the ends of the earth through World Youth Day, Theology on Tap and the new Catholic media companies, all of which are featured in this documentary.

5963834,5,B00F2IYPJW,This DVD covers the questions of why we keep asking ourselves the same questions?  And why do most people find it so hard to believe in The Word and in Jesus Christ.  For all people who wonder if there is a God and does 'Catholicism' really has THE answers (?)  Fr. Barron does a great job of adding up the clues and even providing some answers to the central question:  Is Jesus Christ Emmanuel(?) and what is keeping us from understanding Him (?)  A look at human nature and it's search to perceive and understand if there is a 'Divine Plan'.,1388966400,,544,4.346534653465347

5963842,5,B00F2IYPJW,I am always impressed with the work of Fr. Barron.  He did it again and we ought to be thankful for the continuing reminder of what we need to do better as a Church; to reach out to every person.  It is worth at least one viewing if not more.,1388966400,,242,3.82
5963843,5,B00F2IYPJW,"Fr. Barron is brilliant!  This is a wonderfully challenging and enlightening video series.  Fr. Barron ""hits the nail on the head"" as he calls the vices what they are.

I have no worldly accolades to my name or degrees to my credit, but as all of his other works that I have been through; each has helped me climb my stairway via an escalator ride. I need to go through it again. Like taking yet another spoonful, to get a better taste. By the end of my bowl I know I would have an elevator ride. Just GREAT for everyone.

I do plan to purchase ""The New Evangelization"" in the future. We hope to start an evangelization team and this will be perfect to kick off our mission. The New Evangelization is uplifting but not a cheerleading piece of work.  It is very educational as to the intention of Vatican 11 and shows what went wrong regarding the interpretation of content in the Western world. Father Barron has provided us with a useful tool.",1388966400,,536,4.572916666666667

Robert Barron's ability to weave complex and complicated teachings into language and analogies that are easier to understand, this project is quite helpful.

5963859,3,B00F2IYPJW,"Beautiful graphics but.... not well organized.
Also, the last session was supposed to give instruction about the 'how to' of evangelization, and just focused upon media. The big problem I think, is how to develop programs of welcome, evangelization, discipleship, and support in parish life. Sherry Weddell and George Weigel are more helpful in how to live in community a life focused upon the Good News.. This series lacks personal, 'hands on' advice, although it is generally inspiring.",1387843200,5,488,5.269230769230769
