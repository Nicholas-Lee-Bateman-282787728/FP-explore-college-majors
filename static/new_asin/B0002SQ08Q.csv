8031449,5,B0002SQ08Q,"I am responsible for one of the largest Pine Car Derby's in the country, with over 220 cars racing at our annual event in March. I use the Building Pine Car Racers as a video guide at our annual workshop, where we recently cut approximately 170 cars. I enjoy the logical format of the DVD from how to design and layout your car pattern all the way to adding a finish to your car. I definitely would recommend this video to any organization or any individual who enjoys the process of designing and building a pine car.",1171756800,,518,4.350515463917525
