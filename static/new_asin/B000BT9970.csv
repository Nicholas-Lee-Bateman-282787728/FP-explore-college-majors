2440480,1,B000BT9970,"I was really hopeing that this would be at least an okay beginner DVD.  I teach belly dance and I buy el-chepo DVD's to see what my students/general public might be temped to purchase. Amira Mor has an impressive bio on her website, but I'm just not a fan of her fusion between jazz/salsa/belly dance.  There is no info on the culture of belly dance; and I found the costumes revealing and some of the moves tacky.  I would be ashamed if someone based their perception of what belly dance really is on this video.  It's a beginning student class filmed at Bally Fitness, and it looks like a beginning class.  Even with the plethora of different styles, I would never teach students to bring their shoulders up to their ears in snake arms, or to shoulder shimmy with such a pronounced forward lean.  It gets one star from me because Amira has a positive attitude and lively personality.  You get what you pay for.  IAMED has a much better and classier line of teaching and performance DVDs.  If you can't afford IAMED new, look for them used.",1170374400,13,1041,4.49468085106383
2440481,3,B000BT9970,This video was fun but confusing. She would change moves without telling you how to do it and without any warning she was doing it. She did this alot when the camera wasn't on her so you were looking at the ppl in the back ground. It was fun but not very challenging (unless you count trying to figure out what she is doing now),1153699200,18,328,4.061538461538461
2440482,1,B000BT9970,This is a DVD of a dance class filmed at Bally Total Fitness.  There is no step by step instruction.  The class is just going through the moves and the titles of the moves are flashed across the screen.  Not at all what I expected.  If you are looking for step by step instruction to learn the moves this DVD is probably not for you.,1152748800,29,333,4.076923076923077

8092185,3,B000BT9970,"It definitely is a workout, but, it is just a video of a class, not an instructional DVD. She does give a few tips, but, I was looking for more instruction.",1496188800,,156,4.064516129032258

8092188,4,B000BT9970,I've tried numerous workout videos for belly dance and I find this one the most rewarding in terms of an actual workout. The only down side is that the sound (her microphone) is sometimes a bit hard to understand what she is saying (hence the four star rating). But you can figure it out if you just watch her moves. I am sore after every time I do this workout and you can wear either workout gear or belly dance costume and still be able to do it. It's not too short like most belly dance videos and it can get pretty intense. I really like that she has a variety of ladies (all sizes and ages) doing this workout with her.,1392768000,,625,4.131147540983607
8092189,4,B000BT9970,"This video has the look and feel of taking a dance class at Bally's. It's pretty informal. You get to practice quite a few bellydance moves over and over, so it's good for drill work. I think it's rather long for a single workout, but you could break it down into segments if you wanted with your own warm up and cool down. There's no routine in this DVD, just moves you can use for improvisation. Amira's performance at the end is a nice one. I just wish that you couldn't see the Bally's customers watching ... it was pretty distracting.",1330300800,,539,4.346534653465347
8092190,4,B000BT9970,"This was one of my first belly dance dvd's that I got a few years ago.  I use it periodically and this is one of my favorite Amira Mor dvds (her other ones I would give 2 or 3 stars depending on what dvd it is).  This dvd works well for beginners because it keeps with very simple moves so you don't get frustrated if your knowledge of belly dance is limited.  I like how she explains how to do the moves, especially on the arm moves (however she does have an accent so it can be a bit hard to understand her but I wouldn't mark her down on that as it doesn't hamper effectiveness).  I really like how she presents herself also, she is a confident teacher but not overly bubbly like some instructors can be and she seems to love belly dancing.

The main part of this dvd starts with a few minutes of warm up which prepares the body for the belly dance workout.  She then focuses on the upper body first (snake arms, chest isolations, waist circles, undulations etc) then moves to the lower body (shimmies, pelvic shimmies, etc).  The last part of the dvd works on walking.  I think she could have done a little bit better on this part so I docked a star but it's still not a bad section, just my least favorite part of the workout.  Then comes the free style part where Amira Mor and her class dance.  I have yet to free style belly dance myself so I can't say much.

As I said earlier, this is good for beginners and as a starting point for other dvds (especially the Neon, Blanca, and other World Dance New York belly dance dvds).  The Amira Mor Total Workout Belly dance dvd is a low impact workout but don't let the seemingly easy moves fool you, if done correctly you can really get a good workout (especially your core).  Overall a good dvd and I am happy to have it among my many other belly dancing dvds!",1270512000,,1812,4.202312138728324
8092191,3,B000BT9970,"This is a good dvd, it is basicly a tape of a class,it could be better if it were more one on one instructional.  However the basics are all covered and it is fun.",1223942400,,163,3.7941176470588234
8092192,2,B000BT9970,"I spent $7 on this DVD and still feel ripped off.  It was a tape of a class at Bally's with little instruction.  The dancers in the background weren't even good and there was a 7 year old in there!  I don't want to spend money to watch a class.  I was hoping there would be combinations or something, and there weren't any. I turned it off before it got to the end because I got so bored.  The shoulder shimmies lasted forever, to the point that it was just ridiculous. I haven't decided if I am going to keep it or not.",1199836800,2,520,4.009708737864078
8092193,5,B000BT9970,"Excellent! she has a fabulous technique and for beginners is a wonderful DVD, I have shared this DVD here in Mexico with my Belly Dance students and we have learned all the movements shimmies, ondulations, etc.

It is also a great work-out!!!",1178409600,,242,4.761904761904762
