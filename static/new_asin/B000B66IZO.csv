8082184,5,B000B66IZO,"Dragon Ball Z Vol. 3 of the 49-volume Dragon Box 1-disc DVDs contains episodes 13 to 18 in Japanese mono with Next Episode Previews from the Vegeta Saga or Season 1.

The training continues with Piccolo, Gohan, and the Z-Fighters while Son Goku is going through Snake Way in hopes of meeting King Kai. Bravery and anticipation indeed.

It's good that I'm now importing these DBZ DVDs in the wake of the already expensive Funimation Dragon Box Sets, but again I'm used to watching the Japanese version without subtitles because I care about the story and the action other than English subs blocking my full view every time.
