8474319,4,7538635254,"The Box of this DVD does not mention anything about the region code of it.
But my US DVD player, both regular and blue ray, cannot play it, showing
error message ""invalid region code, cannot play"".
Possible reason:  The DVD still have a region code in it which cannot be played in US DVD players of region code 1.
Another reason:  MY DVD player cannot play DVD without region code.

I finanlly make it work on my DVD player with ""all region"" cabability.

Anyway, the content of this DVD is great and the video is very nice.  Both Chinese and Englihs audio and substitle  ( you can only choose audio, substite is both  either on or off).  It does tell you a lot of the scenery with background informaiton, etc.  Good of viewing before or after you visit the place.

Before buying, check with the seller about the region code problem.
You cannot play it with regular US DVD Player which allows only Region 1 code.",1336953600,,911,4.433734939759036
