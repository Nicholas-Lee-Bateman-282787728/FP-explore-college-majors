8326089,1,B00147F8X2,"A big waste of time. There is nothing on this dvd that can't be learned through research on the internet. Russo, especially, seems much more intent on ""selling"" his trash novels and movies rather than instructing others as how to do make a movie. Terrible waste of money.",1260835200,2,271,4.666666666666667
8326090,3,B00147F8X2,John Russo's Filmmaking Seminar is a very interesting and informative look at low budget filmmaking.  If you want a quick overview about how to start making your own movie this is a good start.  Some of the information here is dated but I would recommend it for any amateur filmmaker.,1233100800,,284,4.66
