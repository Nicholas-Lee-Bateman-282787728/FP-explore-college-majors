2293227,3,B0009IWFEC,"Both my 3 yr old & 4 yr old children love the Rock N Learn videos, but they got bored with this one much faster.  It doesn't have the singing and action like the other videos.  This video mainly consists of still pictures while the narrator reads the highlighted words.",1124236800,16,269,4.36
8061401,1,B0009IWFEC,Wouldn't suggest buying. It doesn't play through the DVD.  You have to presd play every few minutes to move on to the next story.,1489276800,,129,4.375

8061408,4,B0009IWFEC,"This is a quality product, and engages my 6 year old in her interest to read. However, I find it surprising and shortsighted that the DVD does not provide continuous play! I am an extremely busy parent (as most are), and I would have appreciated the convenience of not having to stop what i'm doing in order to man the remote for the duration of this video.",1316995200,4,357,4.343283582089552
8061409,3,B0009IWFEC,"We own other Rock N' Roll products, which are great, like ""Colors, Shapes and Counting"", ""Alphabet"" and ""Phonics"".  My son is 21 months old, and he is beginning to read!!!  This particular DVD has many stories that are rather short and a parent needs to click to start each story.  This frequent parent intervention is not taken favorably by a parent looking for some break.",1212019200,6,374,4.723076923076923
8061410,4,B0009IWFEC,"The reason that this video doesn't have the singing and action like the other videos is because the focus is on learning how to read the text.  It is geared for children who are learning how to read.  I feel that it's a great reinforcement.  However, nothing can replace the interaction between an adult and a child that takes place during the reading process.",1142812800,16,360,4.59375
