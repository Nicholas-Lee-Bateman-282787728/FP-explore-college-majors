8584443,1,B00CPCP8IK,A total waste of money!  This DVD only contains one lesson on 3D Cartesian Coordinates.  The Great Courses provides a 36 course (18 hour) DVD with a workbook for $80.,1440892800,,166,4.5
8584444,5,B00CPCP8IK,Just went throught this dvd.  Ok so basically calc 3 is just calc 1 in 3d.  But of course that is a HUGE difference since the real world in in 3d.  Jason starts out reviewing 3d cartesian coordinates and it is a very nice easy way to begin this difficult subject (which he claims is not difficult if done in a step-by-step fashion.)  I really like his clear presentation of the material so far.  Hopefully I will be able to continue to give him 5 stars because I really want to learn this subject completely so I can eventually go on to quantum math.,1419811200,,550,4.25
