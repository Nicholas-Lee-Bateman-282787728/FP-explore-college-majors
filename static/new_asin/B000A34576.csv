Mostly, because I would forget to. Then in the middle of making a large purchase for my library 3 days ago, the words of Dr. Barbara Brennan author of ""Hands of light"" regarding a statement made by Bentov, echoed in my consciousness. That ""meditators hear high pitched sounds from the astral realm that others can't."" I had known this to be VERY true indeed, so I did the obvious no brainer and purchased this DVD as well as ""Stalking the wild pendulum."" This older work far surpasses the good but trendy consciousness exploration DVD's popular now, such as the secret and even what the bleep. If you are like myself, a no nonsense meat an potatoes type of researcher, who doesn't want a bunch of fluff mixed in. You should spend the $30.00 and purchase this work. Let's be candid and crystal clear. After seeing this monumental contribution to the human family, they would be completely justified for selling this DVD for $100.00  Trust me, purchase this DVD or kick yourself in the ass later for not doing so!

This book will certainly be ""enlightening"" for those who believe in a specific religious God, or a God that has rules, regulations and desires, etc. If Bentov's model of consciousness was taught in elementary and high schools, the world would heal at a rapid pace and be much more love based than fear based.

I recommend all Bentov's books and this DVD program to my students of Holistic Health.
Enjoy!

I enjoyed the dvd from beginning to end.  I recommend it to all searching for their real true roots.  Its a great shove in the right direction.
