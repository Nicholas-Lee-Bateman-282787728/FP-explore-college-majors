Chiquita lies about the shooting!

White Feather tells the Captain about this; he must be at the trial. Chiquita testifies about her duties at Slades place. She tells what Burgess did, the shot came through the window. The bullet did not come from the Lieutenants gun or any Army equipment! White Feather tells about finding two bullets in his dead brother. Sheriff Ryan tells who owned a Colt .41 revolver that uses that caliber. Captain Allister charges Red Greeley as the murderer and Lee Burgess as his accomplice. There is shooting as others in the gang interrupt the trial to rescue Greeley and Burgess! They ride away, the Cavalry and Sheriff in pursuit. There is shooting, riders fall. Greeley is captured. There will be a happy ending for Wilbur and Dolores.

The story by John P. McCarthy is complex in its situations and characters, unlike some simpler Western movies. George F. Hayes from Buffalo NY plays the Sheriff, he is young and beardless here. Harry Carey seems to be the oldest man here. In the trial he acts like a Perry Mason in getting an admission in court. I suspect scenes were omitted from the original movie to reduce the running time, but the quality remains. The flawed character of Wilbur resulted in the deaths of men. Will he have a bright future?",1508112000,,2839,4.752535496957404
8224971,4,B000WPJSVA,"This 1931 Western stars Harry Carey, Carmen Laroux, Kane Richmond, George ""Gabby"" Hayes and Ted Adams.  Captain John Allister (Carey) heads up the local army fort and tries to keep peace in the region.  This is made difficult by a gang of outlaws intent on stealing from and killing peaceful Indians. Lee Burgess (Adams) heads up the gang's activities while working as a foreman on a ranch.  He wants to marry the ranch owner's daughter, Dolores Fernandez (Laroux), but she is more interested in the Captain, that is, until the Captain's handsome younger brother Lieutenant Wilbur Allister (Richmond) shows up.  Burgess, jealous of both the officers, tries to frame the Lieutenant for murder and the Captain has to defend his brother in court.

The story has a mix of drama, humor, romance, and, of course, gunfights.  The quality of the picture and sound is okay, though there are a couple of places where some splicing results in missed lines.  The run time is just over an hour.  Overall, I found this an enjoyable film.",1242259200,,1023,4.839080459770115
