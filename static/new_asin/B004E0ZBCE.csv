8426333,5,B004E0ZBCE,I've loved anything Lee Evans has done since being a teen. He's multi talented and sometimes you miss the subtle stuff he does that is so clever until the second time around :-),1394064000,,177,4.393939393939394
8426334,5,B004E0ZBCE,"Easy to be positive when a fan, but this is not the case. Living in France, Lee Evans is hardly or not known at all. He isn't a big star out here. We saw him playing a little part in The Fifth Element, or a big part in The Mouse, but that's it. I just felt on a show while navigating through youtube one day and had to stop the video. Couldn't stop laughing. Decided to buy myself the bundle of his first 4 shows and that was it. I mean, that was IT ! This man could kill you with his jokes. This is the greatest comic I've ever seen... This little man is a giant and this show is the top of the top !!! There's no moment of rest, no reply. You'll have to surrender. I had to watch the show 6 times cause missed parts while laughing.
Monkey man ? Monkey King !!!",1349136000,,762,3.859872611464968
