8139101,4,B000HEVATE,This lighthearted road film has a lot of heart and a lot of laughs. It's great to see J.P Pitoc and Christian Campbell reunited (and playing alongside Mark Hamill!). A great offering from first-time director Chuck Griffith and Roaring Leo Productions.,1185062400,,251,5.146341463414634
8139102,5,B000HEVATE,"I was surprised that Christian Campbell and J.P. Pitoc played another movie together like they played in ""Trick"". They both seem to play together very well!",1172016000,,156,5.038461538461538
8139103,5,B000HEVATE,"This movie is a wonderful indie film that has an amazing cast and great photography, and a wonderful soundtrack - especially when one considers that it is not a studio film.  Where else can you see Mark Hamill, Nicole Eggert, and Gedde Watanabe in a movie together?  The movie's story is a sweet coming-of-age-ish story of a band and its members, with an ending that might just be the beginning.  100% worth the price of admission.",1169856000,2,431,4.644736842105263
