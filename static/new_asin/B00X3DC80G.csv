7155648,5,B00X3DC80G,"Season 2 of Spenser: For Hire was fantastic!  I just can't get enough of season 2!  I would have to say my favorite episode was ""If you knew Sammy.""  I like all of the episodes of the second season, but that one stands out the most.  In no particular order, other's that stand out are:  ""One if by land, two if by sea"", ""An eye for an eye"", ""Shadowsight"" (the ""Halloween"" episode), ""Among friends"", ""Trial and Error"", ""One for my daughter"" (written by Robert B. & Joan H. Parker, and ""The man who wasn't there"".  By the second season, I felt that the writers and the cast felt really comfortable about the quality and ""feel"" of the show.  Season 2 was a fun season, which also included my favorite assistant director, Alice B.",1469232000,,726,4.413533834586466

7155715,5,B00X3DC80G,Been waiting for a number of years for this DVD boxset. Absolutely loved this show when I was growing up as a teenager in the 80's. Unfortunately this was always on late at night on the BBC in the UK & a number of episodes were not shown. Robert Urich is brilliant as Spenser & Avery Brooks as Hawk is just as good. I would recommend anyone to buy this series as it was one of the best TV shows to come out of the states.,1452384000,,421,3.9069767441860463
7155716,2,B00X3DC80G,"The second season is a disappointment. It started with a new director and then they took away his apartment, blew up his car and his girlfriend left. They changed everything about Spenser that defined him. No wonder it was at the bottom of ratings in the second season. Made a good rebound in the third season but never duplicated the depth of the first season.",1452124800,,361,4.569230769230769

7155729,5,B00X3DC80G,"Spenser was a detective show that always kept you on the edge of your seat not knowing what way the story would twist.  Robert Urich was the perfect choice to play the character.  Years later when they tried to reboot the series with someone else in the role, the series was not as good.  I learned about classical writers as Spenser would quote them in his work.  As a result, I felt better educated after watching it.  I would not recommend the show for kids under 16 years old, because of the adult themes in some of the stories.",1443830400,,532,4.333333333333333

7155754,5,B00X3DC80G,"The second season of Spenser: for Hire wasn't my favorite...

Exec producer Juanita Bartlett had sent Barbara Stock's Susan Silverman packing, and Spenser NEEDED Susan as his lady love, as in Robert B Parkers' hugely successful series of novels. One of the three or four best episodes of the series, The Long Hunt, is just about perfect, and as a plus we see the introduction of the temporary replacement hero car after Spensers' prized classic Mustang is destroyed. Listen carefully to the spiel of the 'realist' junkyard guy... it's excellent!

All that said, the prints are excellent, and the presentation is faithful to the original. Bob Urich was always at least as good as his material allowed, and this series allowed him to do his best work ever.

For the Urich fan or the Spenserphile this set is a must! I hope lotsa folks buy this set so that Warners' releases the third season.",1442275200,2,889,4.759740259740259

7155759,5,B00X3DC80G,"The second season DVD doesn't seem to have the sound balance problems I experienced with season 1. And of course if you're looking at buying this you're already a Spenser fan. Urich is great as Spenser, but Avery Brooks' menacing presence is what really makes the show a cut above most others.

One thing that I didn't remember in its first run on TV was the body count; Spenser and/or Hawk end up killing a couple of guys in about every weekly episode -- that would get some attention in the real world!

BTW, it looks like season 3 is now available.",1441324800,,551,4.392156862745098

I now wish to add my voice to my fellow Spenser For Hire fans, and call Amazon to use their market power and ask WB to release Season 3 as soon as possible. For I look forward to purchasing it as soon as it is released. I hope I don't have to wait too long.

7155895,4,B00X3DC80G,I love the erudite Spenser and the environs of the great city of Boston.  I was really disappointed in the character of Rita Fiore to replace Susan Silverman.  A very bad move as there is absolutely no chemistry between Rita and Spenser.  I Look forward to the return of Susan in Season 3!,1438041600,,289,4.415094339622642

7155960,5,B00X3DC80G,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! I was so excited to see that season 2 was offered that i ordered it right away and when I got it watched it that very same week. I love the pairing of Robert Urich (Spenser) and Avery Brooks (Hawk) together in this series.  I could keep watching it over and over because it has such good story telling and its one of the best series that was out there and got canceled to soon.  So i gave this a 5 star rating hopefully the other seasons will now be released soon!,1435708800,12,483,4.073684210526316
7155961,4,B00X3DC80G,"I never watched this when it aired on tv, but I tend to like old shows so I tried it and I love it! The only problem isthe way season 2 starts. When Spensers girlfriend is gone and there is no explanation except a couple of throw away lines it does not make sense at all. I went back to see if I missed something but did not find any scene with any actual information. It wouldn't have hurt to have him talking to someone at length about it, make an effort to make up some kind of story or reason beyond moving on or whatever the throw away line was.  The only other issue is very common so I won't dock a star but if you watch multiple shows from the same time frame,it is appauling how many tell the exact same story line in episodes. I usually like old shows because they are less predictable, more focussed on story and character than shock value or agendas. There are some episodes that have storylines that match other shows in the same timeframe and that is disappointing but it is expected from tv writers who even back then had difficulty coming up with unique or creative storylines. At least it isn't nearly as bad as now, where almost every show has the same story as another or is ""ripped from the headlines"" and therefore boring and predictable or trying to jam a point of view down your throat...no thanks. So it has some repetition or predictability but not so often that I am dored or do not want to watch it.

The primary problem I have with both season one and two is the sound quality. I have a fabulous brand new tv with great sound but I have to put it on 56 to be able to hear Spenser and some other characters, meanwhile it makes the car chases and other s8und effects plus a few other characters REALLY LOUD! The result being that I cannot watch it when going to bed or it wakes up the hubby suddenly and loudly or I have to keep rewinding to hear Spenser because it is too low. Old showsare comfortinv and my favorite time towatch is at bedtime becauseit is relaxing...so the sound issue is enough to dock it one star. I will buy all seasons thatget released but for the price the sound quality is a ripoff. I have much older shows with much better sound.",1435536000,13,2181,4.240384615384615

7156001,4,B00X3DC80G,"Robert Parker wasn't altogether happy with Robert Urich's portrayal of Spenser. That's too bad. I've read the books and watched the series. I respectfully disagree with Parker; Urich is Spenser. He brings to life the wise-cracking, straight-shooting private cop with a heart. It's too bad that neither of them are still with us, but now their contributions to great storytelling will live on in this classic TV drama.

Avery Brooks plays Hawk with smoldering intensity, part mercenary, part style with substance on his terms. Barbara Stock is Susan Silverman, the woman in Spenser's life (Unfortunately fired from the 2nd season & that's the reason for only 4 stars. Big mistake. She was rehired for 3rd season.) Her character provides the grounding and humanity that sometimes gets lost in the work Spenser does. Although the roles are smaller, the always dependable Richard Jaeckel as by-the-rules Lt. Quirk and the comic relief of Ron McLarty as Stg. Belson add foil to Spenser's irreverent cool.

There are diamonds in the rough here as well. See Patricia Clarkson and William H Macy before they became household names. Clarkson's performance in ""The Choice"" as a natural-born killer, displays her budding talent with menacing clarity.

I hope Warner sees fit to release the other seasons as ""Hawk's Eyes"" is one of the best episodes of the series and occurs in the third season bringing Susan to the crossroads of her deeply held principles. Meanwhile, enjoy Urich's signature role as Spenser. It's intelligent, funny, full of action (thanks to a little car called a Mustang) and deals with issues still not resolved by American culture.

""Spenser: For Hire"" is as much a classic as the car he drives. Enjoy the ride!
