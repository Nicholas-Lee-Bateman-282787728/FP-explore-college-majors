2683260,3,B000K7JY7S,"I think that the docs and this program are great for just about everyone but this workout is too simple for anyone whose tried a variety of workouts.  I would reccommend this for someone who has NEVER worked out before.

Also, you don't need to purchase even if Amazon offers it for 1/2 price.  The book I ordered also came with a free copy and the docs tell you to copy and distribute to anyone who wants it, they just want people to get healthier and the advice in the book will do that.",1168300800,42,489,4.180851063829787

2683262,5,B000K7JY7S,"I have been very pleased with the You on a Diet Workout DVD. It takes everything from the book and puts it on an easy to use DVD program of about 20 minutes. Having three levels on one DVD, it is easy to progress from one level to another. It is so much easier to stay motivated using the DVD than trying to remember or reading the book. A great purchase!",1168300800,3,355,4.014084507042254
2683263,3,B000K7JY7S,"The exercises are really good---and work well. The counting of the time on the exercises was not evenly metered, which was a little annoying. The guy demonstrating and directing the exercises also counted in reverse, which made the time seem even longer. It would have been better for him to continue describing how the excercises worked the muscles, time frame to see results, etc. to take your mind off the slow counting. There are 3 levels, but they are the same routine, just done in a more intense way.",1167868800,9,507,4.707865168539326
2683264,4,B000K7JY7S,"If you only have 20 minutes to work out, this is the way to go.  It's a no-frills quickie workout that really does hit all the major muscle groups.  If you are into Denise Austin-type DVD's or fad workouts, you will not appreciate this one.  This has no fancy production, choreography, too-buff ""students"", or funky music--just basic moves given in a straightforward manner with enough repetition to burn some.",1167350400,80,410,4.913043478260869
2683265,3,B000K7JY7S,"I got the DVD, but it is difficult for me to follow. I am 253lbs and 51inc waist. Not easy to follow the movement on DVD.

It will be good if the trainees are mixed, one slim body the other person like myself, so I can see how my ""image"" does the workout.

I try every day to follow the workout but could not finish all.

Next edition I hope the DVD will have the trainees of different weight and ages. That will be very interesting.",1166572800,26,433,4.011627906976744

2683283,5,B000K7JY7S,"Beginner provides the returning exerciser or new to exercise a great foundation.  Then intermediate steps it up. Advanced gets the exerciser to the level to tackle more challenging routines.

Many other programs don't use a building approach which may cause the exerciser to drop out of the program.

Couple this with You On a Walk or the at home AHA Leslie Sasone 1, 2, and 3 mile walking program and you have a great program to build up your fitness levels.

And stick to it for success rather than giving up.",1311897600,3,511,4.582417582417582

2683285,5,B000K7JY7S,"This is simply the best short workout around. Others are trying to copy what Harper already figured out; how to get a body in great shape in the shortest possible time. Seriously, if you can get through the entire advanced workout without a single break (the squats are killer!), you are in great shape. In 20 minutes, he covers everything you need, all muscle groups get a workout, the balance section is hugely effective, and he includes a full, crucial back workout with both the ""Superman"" exercises and the dreaded ""Rickety Table"".

Fast forward past the You Docs, they are not important, get right to Harper. He's a great instructor, describes all the moves really well, builds the workouts up nicely (moving from Beginner to Intermediate to Advanced), and the music, which isn't the best, is thankfully soft. I like the plain, bare stage. I can really see the moves and emulate the positions.

My only worry is when I'll be able to do the entire Advanced workout without a pause, then what?",1276560000,4,997,4.757225433526012
2683286,4,B000K7JY7S,"As the title of this review implies, this workout is centered around using resistance and your own body weight to get a workout - very Pilates-esque.  For someone who has a very sedentary job-typing 8 or more hours a day with no good reason to ever get up and move around, this is a very refreshing way to stretch out while exercising.  I wasn't look for anything very aerobics-y yet, although you certainly do break a sweat.  For the price, you can't beat this DVD which teaches you moves you'll use - even if you eventually DO get a gym membership.",1275868800,2,550,4.425742574257426

Now, we just have to add the 30 minute walk a day or something similar and we're all set. What I love most is that it makes a great start of our days.",1255564800,8,320,3.791044776119403
2683291,5,B000K7JY7S,"I bought this dvd and the book over 2 years ago.  Following the book for diet and walking (30 minutes a day) along with this dvd, I lost over 30 pounds in 5 months.  The dvd is easy to follow and the three routines are short for those who have little time to exercise.  I never made it to the advanced workout but I still managed to lose the weight.

2683294,4,B000K7JY7S,"I really like that there are 3 different levels of workout, all the same idea, but with more difficult variation as the level increases.  I'm not a huge fan of the instructor, especially when he says, ""Come on, come on, get that knee up!""  It's not the most motivating for me.  He also has some questionable counting methods, but I think that's more funny than anything.
If you're looking to be entertained or jazzed up, this is definitely not for you.  I'm in pretty good shape, but the intermediate level kicks my butt and I feel like I've done a lot of muscle work afterwards.  I do some extra cardio to burn some more calories, but the exercises here are intense and don't take a lot of time or space, and no equipment.",1235260800,,723,4.406015037593985
2683295,5,B000K7JY7S,"My husband and I decided to do the YOU on a Diet after the New Year.  As part of the plan, we got the video You on a Diet Workout.

I am just about ready to start doing the second level and am looking forward to it!  I have had  other exercise videos, but none I liked as well.",1233619200,3,423,3.8045977011494254
2683296,5,B000K7JY7S,"I bought the book when it first came out and got the DVD for free (the very funny FBI warning at the beginning says please copy this and give it to everyone you know). The workouts are really only 20 minutes each and when you are done, you do feel that you got your workout in for the day. All of the workouts utilize the same moves but they do get harder and longer from Beginner to Advanced. Joel takes you through it in a nice down to earth way, so you feel like it's just him and you working out together. I travel a lot for business and this really comes in handy when you don't want to go to the hotel gym in your pjs or your hotel does not have a gym. [...]",1230422400,2,664,3.889705882352941

2683298,5,B000K7JY7S,"This is not a hard core workout by any definition, instead it is a nice workout that is gentle and easy to do.

I have been working on trying to get back into shape and have found the ""You.."" series extremely valueable including this.

Nice short routines with good stretching and enough of a workout that you feel your muscles moving and heart rate going but you do not feel like you are going to pass out.  The beginners section is great is you are like me and just trying to get back into shape.

If you have the book, the DVD is a great addition.

Highly recommended.",1223424000,,571,4.25
2683299,5,B000K7JY7S,"My husband and I both enjoy doing this one together.  If you haven't worked out for a while, this is perfect, as it starts out easy and then you can move to a harder level when you are ready. Each level takes only about 10 minutes.  I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to break into a workout routine without hurting themselves.",1221436800,,340,4.380952380952381
2683300,5,B000K7JY7S,"First, let me say that I HATE to work out. Every time I buy another workout DVD, it is with the hope that it will somehow be an enjoyable way to shape up and stay that way.

I can honestly say that I finally found what I've been looking for in this DVD. The exercises are easy to follow and most achieve maximum results with a minimum of wasted effort by targeting several zones per exercise. It's a gentle workout in the Pilates/yoga vein, so if you're looking for a punching/kickboxing type workout, you will not be happy with this.

Another plus is that the guy who leads the workout has a very easy manner which is quite a nice departure from some of the screaming drill sergeant types (both men and women) on other DVDs. I love this workout.",1216339200,20,746,4.321428571428571
2683301,3,B000K7JY7S,"These are okay introductory workouts -- apparently just what the doctors ordered -- but should have more attention to form and safety. For example, parts of the routine require you to balance standing on one foot. The very thin instructors do this bare-foot and do not say anything about foot or ankle support. I am quite heavy; after doing this workout, barefoot as shown, only a few times I developed what may have been a stress fracture in one foot that took several weeks to disappear. I have no medical training, but I suggest athletic footwear if you are a heavier person.",1214438400,6,578,4.676470588235294
2683302,5,B000K7JY7S,"Finally, a good idea for protecting your neck!  For years I have started and stopped workouts with ""crunches"" because they hurt my neck and did very little to strengthen my abs.  Because I usually begin a workout because I need to reduce the size of my stomach and tighten my abdominal muscles, I have tried numerous workouts.  I believe I have found a workout that will work!  I can do the abdominal portion of this dvd!  I am AMAZED!  I would highly recommend this workout as challenging, but doable.  So far I've only done the Beginner Level.",1214179200,4,545,4.556701030927835

2683304,5,B000K7JY7S,"Great workouts with 3 levels.  Gradually, you do feel better and are surprised by how fast you get better and go through workouts faster.

2683305,4,B000K7JY7S,"This exercise workout has three levels:  beginner, intermediate and advanced.  While it says that you can copy this DVD and give it out, that seemed to make the DVD unplayable after that.  I've bought this DVD three times because I really like the workouts, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the DVD.

Update:  Finally, I was able to use this DVD as it was supposed to be used.  It's really a great set of exercises, even for those 50-60 years of age.",1212883200,3,461,4.428571428571429
2683306,4,B000K7JY7S,"I really liked this product but I guess I thought I would hear more from Dr. Oz.

2683307,3,B000K7JY7S,"This workout is actually strenuous.  I was pleasantly surprised, considering the price (cheap).  I enjoy it.  The trainer is a bit annoying, but I get annoyed when I am being told to do it again--only longer.",1211587200,3,208,4.722222222222222
2683308,2,B000K7JY7S,"Dr. Oz and Roizen did a spectacular job on their You On A Diet series of books.  These are some of the best written and easy to understand books for the average person wanting to understand how their internal body functions.  However, they dropped the ball in the exercise department first by passing the task of exercise formatting to a ""celebrity trainer"" who is extremely uninformed about proper body mechanics, spine integrity and general body placement for optimal function.  If exercise results were this easy to come by everyone that does anything would be in great shape and you know that is not the case.  This workout could be a reasonable beginner workout that would work for a couple of weeks until the body adapted to it.  At this point, a more progressive workout would be needed for continuous improvement.

The bottom line is this.  Proper diet can not be accomplished by such a simple task as adding broccoli into your diet.  The same holds true for exercise.  It is wishful thinking and a lack of understanding to think that this workout is all the body needs for maintaining optimum function, let alone actually building lean body mass as the authors state.

I was able to do the workout one time before I had trouble with the DVD. I really was not that impressed with it anyway. Joel kept stopping what he was doing to demonstrate, on the model, the ""proper"" way to do the exercise. It would have been more beneficial for him to just model the  proper way himself, which he did part of the time. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason why he would stop what he was doing to show us on her what to do.

2683336,5,B000K7JY7S,"I was happy to see this workout DVD, which is a callisthenics, yoga and pilates combo.  The beginner version is low to no impact with static holds and stretches.  I use it as a warm-up for more strenuous stuff.  The basic is not cardio and will not burn calories, but it's a good morning/evening or preliminary routine with good instruction and nothing annoying -- except for the caveat below.  It pretty much hits all the muscle groups.

All three workouts seem to last 20 min, which makes them efficient.  The advanced one moves faster and therefore is more challenging and does provide some cardio.  As a woman, I appreciate the emphasis on shoulders and chest, which is where I am weak.  Most exercise stuff geared toward women works our fat zones, which is good.  But this one rounds things out, IMHO.

ONE CAVEAT: The instructor, Joel Harper, doesn't always have good form in the lower half of his body.  He isn't as stretched as he should be.  It bothers me that his legs are always slightly bent, even when they should be straight.  He does not have one continuous line from hip through knee through foot, which often dangles rather than being flexed, pointed or facing forward as is common in yoga.  He isn't be a good role model for lower body work or for full stretches and extensions that pull along the hamstrings.  But hopefully better informed users of the tape know that and improve on the teacher's form.;-)

Amazon's price is excellent.  However, you can also find all three workouts online for free (legitimately) and can access it as a Podcast for listening on your own or viewing with Quicktime from your computer.  Apparently you can also see it on a Photo iPod.",1181433600,22,1684,4.650847457627119

Both workouts have no singing--it's all music. They are both nicely paced--even the beginner workout gets you up to a nice pace rather quickly.  The advanced CD has great music (at least, if you are a baby boomer, like me), but I enjoyed both of them.  I am an advanced exerciser, used to walking in the morning almost every day for 30-60 minutes, and then doing a workout tape at night.

He was patronizing to the woman who was doing most of the actual exercises while he stood there and lectured.  His counting method is stupid--he'll be counting down, then he'll repeat a number over and over (12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8).  I find that incredibly insulting and demotivating.

Why do you love to hate it?!?  When you're doing the workout, you want to know exactly how much longer you'll have to push yourself and give yourself that goal.  When he says ""5 more, 4 more"" - and then starts talking about something (for say 15 seconds), then comes back and says ""4 more"" (yes, we're back to 4), ""3 more, 2 more"" - then more talk - ""2 more, 1 more""...that can drive you crazy!

Particularly if you prefer the privacy of your own home.",1168300800,12,644,4.461538461538462

2683383,5,B000K7JY7S,"This is a marvelous workout DVD.  The workout takes only 20 minutes, and the DVD has a section for 3 separate levels of fitness, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  I have been doing the Beginner workout 3 times a week (for about 3 weeks now) and have really had positive results all over my body, with the best results showing in my abdomen/midsection, bottom and thighs.  I highly recommend this for busy people, or those just getting back into a fitness regime.",1168300800,14,466,4.728395061728395
2683384,5,B000K7JY7S,"This was unlike any other diet book I've read; and I've read a lot! It was funny, entertaining, and full of no-nonsence tips and advice for anyone who has ever struggled with weight loss.  I actually learned a lot of things from this book and found it quite motivational.  A must read!",1168300800,4,285,4.461538461538462
2683385,5,B000K7JY7S,This is a great workout for someone that doesn't want to bounce around and get dizzy!  It's very calm and detailed and actually kind of relaxing.  You actually look forward to doing it because you do feel stretched and relaxed afterwards.  I would highly recommend this before any other workout.,1168300800,7,295,4.86

Michele does a GREAT job.",1168300800,9,255,4.204081632653061

8154586,5,B000K7JY7S,"This workout seems so simple yet it really works.  No it's not flashy but it's effective.  I've used it in the past and lost 40 lbs following the advice from the book and doing the workout 4 times a week.  I just started again and in the first week I've lost 3 lbs and 3 INCHES from my waistline.  I highly recommend this workout.  Yes the trainer is a bit annoying and the music isn't exactly the most exciting but if you're looking for results and not excuses then you'll be very happy with your purchase.  Remember muscle burns fat and calories all day,  build more muscle and burn more fat and calories.  That's the thought behind this workout.  We've been brainwashed into thinking exercise needs to be hard and painful if it's to be effective.  That's simply not true.  You deserve better fitness,  give this a shot and you will be so pleased you did.",1483574400,,857,4.423076923076923
