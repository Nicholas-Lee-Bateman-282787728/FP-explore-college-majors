COSA QUE SIRVE HARTO  PORQUE MANSON NO VINO PARA AC :(  CREME, AUNQUE NO ENTIENDAS NI JOTA DE  INGLES IGUAL TE VAS A ENTRETENER POR QUE MANSON TIENE UNA CHISPA TREMENDA  EN SUS PRESENTACIONES EN VIVO, TANTO LAS IMAGENES COMO EL SONIDO",946512000,3,412,4.5

Nothing is left out, and nothing is edited!  You get to see his  transformations from the early days to the current Omega persona!

1255647,5,B00002NDKU,"this god is on tv video si rgeat ! we go from the very last video with marilyn as jfk dying in the car to the very first one when he was a nice dark haired rocker. cool ! and through the minutes, u go deeper and deeper  into his work of art : from no -sex to full sex people, dark things, gothic  and mystical videos, some great stuff is the long hard road out of hell  video for he's sexless or androgyn and that's great ! to all who hate him  and his band, never forget he just pull tricks and the more u get in it,  the more he has to do it. u give him power. and come on ! this is just fun  and rock n roll !",945475200,4,612,3.56390977443609
1255648,4,B00002NDKU,"This video is really amazing.  To have all of those videos on it was really worth the wait.  I did have a problem with it, though.  While the videos never get tiring, the ""Backstage"" stuff was at times  confusing.  There was just too much hustle and bustle.  Also, there are  times when it dramatically slows down to a super-boring pace.  However,  these incidences are few and far between and this video's still worth the  investment.  Not for everybody (obviously), but it will appeal to those who  love this kind of thing and are not easily offended by thick language or  severe sexual innuendo.",943920000,,598,4.689320388349515
1255649,5,B00002NDKU,"I've been waiting for years for Marilyn Manson to release a compilation of all their videos, and finally they've done it!  And what an extra treat to include an extra hour of live concert and backstage footage!  You get to  see the band putting out great music and also acting quite playful  backstage...and you get to hear Ginger speak!  Watching the live footage  gives you back a glimmer of the powerful force of feeling you get when  you're at a Manson concert.  I only wish they'd placed the entire songs on  video rather than simply clips.  But the new album will appease my desire  for live recordings.  BUY THIS VIDEO!  YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",942019200,5,648,4.578947368421052
1255650,5,B00002NDKU,"This video is awsome. The videos that are MTV never shows are on here. The backstage footage is also sweet. Trust me, it can't be better than this.  Marilyn Manson rules",941846400,2,169,4.451612903225806
1255651,5,B00002NDKU,"I first bought this VHS used because it was out of print. A long while later, I saw it at Hastings for sale; Which brought me comfort knowing that now Manson fans won't have to search hard for a copy. This is Manson way giving us exactly what we wanted. This is an essential for Manson fans. It includes all his videos from Portrait of an American Family (1st album) all the way to Mechanical Animals (4th album). I have seen his newer videos, and would be a happy happy person if he would release a DVD with his videos. But I have heard that sometime He going to relese a ""Greatest Hits"" album with a bonus DVD with all his videos. I don't know how he can manage to decide what to put on his GH album seeing as how all his songs are great! Anywhoo this VHS is the greatest thing ever invented since buttered toast! Here's all his videos:
COMA WHITE ~ A beautiful song with a beautiful video that makes you feel emotional inside like you want to cry. This song was based on one of Manson's dearest friends who commited suicide because she was abused, and resorted to drugs. I almost can feel Manson's pain. I'm speachless...
ROCK IS DEAD ~ This isn't like the butchered version you saw on MTV with all the clips of The Matrix. This is just the views of Manson and the band jaming on that set. That may make it sound boring, but it's alot better than the Matrix Promo version. Ginger Fish (Drummer) really glistened in this video. Interesting and a good catchy song.
I DON'T LIKE THE DRUGS ~ One of the best videos on here. It's nice Jazzy R&B Glamour styled song goes perfectly with the scenes of Manson showing his creativity making this video seem almost like a movie with a plot. A definate reason to rewind the tape.
THE DOPE SHOW ~ Manson with breasts being captured and exploited by the evil Music Industry; giving Manson everything he wants, but not what he truly want. Which unfortunatly I am not witty enough to interprate. You'll need to see the video. I can't possibly describe it. One of Mansons best! I love it!
LONG HARD ROAD OUT OF HELL ~ Manson crossdressed, and making love with mannequins in still scenes. This was on the extras on the Spawn DVD if you have it. A catchy song which the video personifies that Manson is not afraid of what people think of him. He is a true role model if you truly know his person
CRYPTORCHILD ~  A kooky Manson song with lots of grotesque imagry and electric sounds. Shot in a fuzzy black and white mode. Making this a true macabre Manson masterpiece.
MAN THAT YOU FEAR ~ Another beautiful Manson song that has a video that is almost funny; how a trailor park village, in a remote dessert where everyone dresses fancy. And Manson leads them down a trail where you'll notice the members playing their instruments (Notice Zimzum playing a Tuba). Another good video
TOURNIQUET ~ One of my favorite Manson songs with a video that may seem a little disgusting with the bug eating and all, but somehow the charm of Manson's music makes it all so poetic.
THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ~ A weird Manson video presenting one of his most powerful songs. The scenery must have cost alot, but Manson spared no expense to make a classic song that will make you break something on account of the adrenaline rush of power you get from hearing this song! I love this song, but I'm a little pissed that the audio is edited. I'm not saying that I MUST hear Manson dropping F-bombs in his lyrics. But I feel cencorship mutes a little bit of the art of lyric writting.
SWEET DREAMS ~ It's shot with a fish-eye lense to make everything look distorted in some scenes, which is cool. This song makes me happy for some reasons. I like to listen to this song in the dark with a candle lit, and just relax. You'll love this song, trust me. How could you not?
DOPE HAT ~ The best video on here! Like watching Saturday-Moring Cartoons while tripping out on Acid! I like how kooky Manson made this video. How can you not enjoy this video?! This video is a parody of the boatride through the tunnel in Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory except for Manson play Wonka, and the Kids aboard are tied to the Mast. You'll see the Oompa Loompas drink whiskey, and things like that. Kick-ass!!
LUNCHBOX ~ A power anthem for kids getting picked on at school. Another entertaining video, It's cool to see Manson without his makeup on. The little kid is funny. It's funny when he goes into the rollarskating rink to see Manson, and trips all the skaters. Ends with a view of a burning lunchbox. Manson 4ever!!
GET YOUR GUNN ~ A good Manson video. He's dressed like a pilgrim on the TV screen. Not his most creative, but a good one. And hey, this was earlier. So the band probably just didn't have enough money to make it more juicy. Still a good one and Manson went far far far with the idea.
UNCUT DOPE SHOW ~ A little pointless. just Twiggy R. and M.W. Gacy in the car fondling the woman in The Dope Show. Then the woman dancing for about a minute, then it cuts.
FOOTAGE ~ The funniest thing I've seen in a long time. I don't want to give anything away. So buy the VHS and see for yourself.
BUY IT!",1088812800,17,5101,4.352570828961175
1255652,5,B00002NDKU,"Being a huge fan of Manson, when i discovered that there was a tape with almost all of his videos on it, i jumped to buy it.  Now i am forever happy that i bought it.  The music videos are only what you would expect of manson, and sometimes they even left me spechless.  The early ones from portrait of an American Family are very weird becuase of their cheap production value. The 'low-quality' special effects on Dope Hat are enough to send into tears even though it still is a cool video, and 'Get Your Gunn' looks totally like a classic rock video.  'Coma White' is a beautifull JFK assaination reanactment, and is so emotional it even still leaves me speachless.  'I don't like the Drugs but the Drugs Like Me' is a rather odd one where Manson carries around a cross made out of telivisions. ""Man that you fear' is also very sad showing Manson getting ready to be exicuted. And of course there is the sexy video 'Long Hard Road Out of Hell' that features Manson naked.
Now for the tour footage...I must say that the footage wasn't as 'crazy' or 'disgusting' as most people said it was.
The cover of the video has a parental advisory sticker that states 'Contains nudity, graphic language and explicit material that some may find disturbing.  Parental supervision is highly advised'
Most of the live preformances aren't full songs.  They get either cut or Manson heads off into some strange antics.  At the begining, Manson preforms 'The Reflecting God' and when it cuts away, Manson is backstage screaming obscenities and breathing from an oxygen mask. I'd like to go into detail about the entire movie, but i'll just give you some of my favorite parts:  the band covers Ginger with condiments, John and Twiggy give Manson head then John explains what it was like, the band destroys the instruments and sets the drums on fire while someone is still playing them, the band snorts up coke with pointers from Manson, and Manson goes to a soundcheck naked.",1085097600,4,1957,4.632947976878612
1255653,5,B00002NDKU,"This video features all of the Marilyn Manson music videos from Portrait Of An American Family to Mechanical Animals. Plus some extra concert footage. My favorite video off MA is ""Coma White"" which is a reenactment of the JFK Assassinations. ""Long Hard Road Out Of Hell"" which was featured on the Spawn Soundtrack features Manson nude! The videos off ""Antichrist Superstar"" are very eye-catching. ""Man That You Fear"" and ""The Beautiful People"" are my favorites. ""Sweet Dreams"" shows Manson and the band in a dilapidated house. ""Dope Hat"" is my favorite video because it's basically a really demented version of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. ""Lunchbox"" is an old video which shows the band playing in a roller-rink. The concert footage is a real treat too. I hope they re-release this on DVD with videos from ""Holy Wood"" and ""Golden Age Of Grotesque"" added to it.",1079568000,,869,4.918367346938775
1255654,4,B00002NDKU,"This is an AMAZING tape. It really captures the true essence of marilyn and everything that he stands for. If you're a ""new manson famiely member"", or just want to know more about him, then this is the tape to watch (hence the title of this review).
The tape begins with a bunch of his best videos. It starts off with his melodic, tearfull JFK video, ""coma white""; diminishing any sick shock rock steriotype thoughts you might have of him rite from the start. Some of the others are ""dont like the drugs"", ""the dope show"", ""the man that you fear"", and also some originals from 1989 through the early 90's like ""get your gunn"", lunchbox"", and ""sweet dreams"".
It also has some great live footage, some quite x-rated. If you're a homophobe, i suggest you don't watch it...
And ofcorse some halarious backstage footage that lets you get to know his band aswell, and a short interview with marilyns parents.
It's a VERY good tape. You WONT be sorry for buying it.",1070064000,,958,4.543352601156069
1255655,5,B00002NDKU,"God is in the TV contains all of Marilyn Manson's music videos (up until 1999) and a collection of concert footage and behind the scenes shenanigans.  Starting off with the excellent video for ""Coma White"" (which features Manson and then love Rose McGowen) and moving it's way backwards through the years as an almost de-evolution of Manson and his band.  The standout videos are ""Long Hard Road Out of Hell"" (from the Spawn soundtrack), ""Man That You Fear"", and the classic ""Lunchbox"".  After the videos we are treated to some live segments from the ""Rock is Dead"" tour, plus some backstage shenanigans that are nothing short of disturbing, disgusting, and hilarious.  All in all, God is in the TV is an absolute must own for any and every Manson fan.",1057276800,3,752,4.7615384615384615
1255656,5,B00002NDKU,"BUY THIS FILM! What are you waiting for? Whip out those credit cards let's go! I am a big MM fan and this was one of the greatest purchases I will have ever made. The first half of the movie is music videos- Coma White, Rock Is Dead, I Don't Like The Drugs,The Dope Show,Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, Cryptorchild,Man That You Fear,Tourniquet,The Beautiful People,Sweet Dreams,Dope Hat,Lunch Box,and Get Your Gunn. So as you can see already,they give u a lot to enjoy. The last 45 mins. or so is concert footage,and backstage footage, which is hilarious!!! There's this part where Twiggy's backstage with John 5, and Twiggy has a gun, and he goes, ""I got the gun, boy, I got the gun, who's the man!"" Me and my friend used to crack each other up because we once screwed up on saying that and it came out, ""I got the man, who's the gun!"" So we went around for weeks yelling that randomly around school.(Okay so you had to be there, but once you see it you'll understand.)I do have a word of warning to all you with easily concerned parents, this movie contains some ""vulgar"" stuff (like twiggy and John 5 giving Manson head on stage, which to me is awesome!)Of course language is a big one two, I mean c'mon, this is MM we're speaking of. So basically just be careful when watching it, the first time you view it, you should maybe wait until your parents aren't home so you'll know the layout. This movie is especailly awesome is you're into one of the band members because it shows them in the backstage footage quite a bit, so have fun! Buy this! In fact I think I'll go watch it right now!",1045440000,5,1588,4.35016835016835
1255657,5,B00002NDKU,"I had to give this 5 stars because the 13 videos on here are awesome. Marilyn Manson is truly a unique one-of-a-kind artist and it shows! Starting with Coma White, the videos begin with the most recent in 1999, including Long Hard Road Out of Hell (an awesome song and video), The Beautiful People, Sweet Dreams, and ending with Dope Hat (humorous video), and Lunch Box (always a Manson classic). Then you are treated to concert footage and some backstage antics. Marilyn's parents even make a cameo in support, as always, of their son. There is also a few clips of signs that some anti-Manson groups made. They really show what hypocrits they are. (When you see these signs keep in mind that Christians are not supposed to pass judgement on others.) If you are truly a Manson fan then you should already know what he is about, therefore nothing on this video should be a surprise. It is really a very fun and enjoyable time.",1020902400,7,925,4.578313253012048
1255658,4,B00002NDKU,"I approached this one with hyperactive excitement initially, and now I've calmed down I still enjoy this heaps. Well created, well put together peice of work. The film clips have gotten more an more amusing throughout the years (""Dope Hat""??)and more slick and professional as the band have taken off and can afford expensive directors.
I'm sure this has been said before, but perhaps Manson was reading ""The Lottery"" before creating the concept for ""Man that you Fear""....",1008288000,,473,5.076923076923077
1255659,4,B00002NDKU,"This features all of Mr. Manson's music videos from Portrait of An American Family (1994), Antichrist Superstar (1996), Mechanical Animals (1998) and then it features live footage from the Rock is Dead tour with the band Hole (1999). All of the music videos included are played from the most recent to the earliest recorded. The videos are Coma White, Rock is Dead, I Don't like the Drugs, Dope Show, Man That You Fear, Cryptorchid, Tourniquet, Beautiful People, Sweet Dreams, Lunchbox and Get Your Gun. Coma White features Manson being the President, and tragically being shot in a JFK reenactment. Rock is Dead is just of a live performance of the band. I Don't like the Drugs is a comical with several Jerry Springerish parodies. Dope Show has Manson in his suit with breasts, and a live performance of the band. Man That You Fear has Manson as a condemned man who is going to be stoned to death. Cryptorchid features footage of death and decrepit things, hence why it was not on MTV. Tourniquet is just odd having several rotten things and insects. The video for Beautiful People has Manson on stilts dressed in all white. Sweet Dreams is more artistic than anything else. Lunchbox features a roller rink and a kid holding a lunchbox wanting to be a rock star. Get Your Guy is very dark and menacing with a live performance from the band. As for the live footage, it's the same old stuff, concert footage with behind the scenes shenanigans.",1002758400,27,1444,4.711462450592886

Pero lo mejor para m es la hora de concierto que tiene, que como  manson no vino a Chile este ao es una buena forma de ver que tal eran los  shows del mechanical, aunque todo confabula y yo creo que para disfrutar  mejor este video hay que tener  los discos de manson en estudio.

highlights: manson and twiggy drive a go-kart.  quite a few of  the backstage clips.  the vids are all superb.  and then you can always  look forward to the small speach about manson's 'dream' he tells the crowd  before they kick into 'i don't like the drugs (but the drugs like me)'.

The only problem is that the live part is really dedicated to backstage,  which means that most of the songs are cut.  That's not a problem if you're  interested in what happens backstage and how the band members get along  (plus we get to hear Pogos voice! ).
