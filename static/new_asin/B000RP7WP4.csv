8202094,4,B000RP7WP4,"HOUSE ON GREENAPPLE ROAD is notable to me, first and foremost, because of its stellar, nearly miraculous cast! Opening at the scene of a brutal murder, when little Margaret Ord (Eve Plumb- THE FORCE OF EVIL, TV's BRADY BUNCH) arrives home from school, unaware that someone's blood has been splattered all over the kitchen. Enter Lieutenant Dan August (Christopher George- GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, PIECES), his partner, Sergeant Charles Wilentz (Keenan Wynn- PIRANHA, THE DARK), their boss, Chief Frank Untermyer (Barry Sullivan- EARTHQUAKE), and Sheriff Muntz (Edward Asner- THE SATAN BUG, TV's MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW), all out to solve the case. In spite of the copious amount of blood, no body is found. What happened to the apparent victim, Marian Ord (Janet Leigh- TOUCH OF EVIL, PSYCHO, THE FOG)? Taking care of Margaret when police arrive is Marian's sister in-law, Leona Miller (Julie Harris- THE HAUNTING, HOW AWFUL ABOUT ALLAN), who doesn't seem overly surprised by the grim situation. Marian's tragic story is told through flashbacks, as August begins questioning those who knew her. In this pilot, George plays August w/ a harder edge than Burt Reynolds did when he took over the role for the TV series. The rest of the cast includes Walter Pidgeon (FORBIDDEN PLANET, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA), TV regular, William Windam, and Lynda Day George (DAY OF THE ANIMALS, ANTS, BEYOND EVIL, PIECES) and other familiar faces. More drama / police procedural than thriller, HOGR may be considered ""dull"" by more modern viewers, raised on mindless action films. Oddly enough, my favorite scenes involve the leader (Lawrence Dane) of the kooky ""Church Of Contemplation"". Man, that Marian sure got around!...",1453680000,,1716,5.132142857142857
