8445943,4,B004X2JNQI,"Wales is not as well-known in America as Ireland or Scotland, but this video will prove a striking revelation to those unfamiliar with ""Cymru"" (as the local inhabitants refer to their homeland).  ""A Journey Through Wales"" is brimming over with beautiful images, and depicts a land of utter enchantment and scenic variety -- mountains, beaches, forests, castles -- like something out of a fairy tale or fantasy epic.

A pleasant (albeit synthesized) sound track of Welsh traditionals accompanies the scenery, resulting in a captivating and immersive experience.  It is perhaps not recommended for people with short attention spans or who need things spelled out for them, but for those seeking a relaxing, soothing ""journey"" through a land of exquisite beauty, this video delivers in spades.  Hopefully the producers of this video will continue this series, with similar journeys to other faraway lands.",1415318400,,902,5.330985915492958

8445945,4,B004X2JNQI,"Someone gave an unfavorable review to the digital download version of this program, complaining of generic footage and a lack of guidance. While I respect the opinion of a resident of this beautiful country, I want to explain why I liked it. Since there is little specific information provided about this program, Im going to be fairly comprehensive in describing the locations.

This is NOT a travel video or a showcase of Welsh culture or day-to-day life. Yet I fail to see why those are mandatory requirements for similar programs. The concept of nature videos is not new. Back in the 1980s with the advent of the VCR, the idea was thriving, and many of them did exactly what this one does: point and shoot at random (but lovely) locations and intersperse a pinch of music now and then. If you like instrumental nature videos or lots of landscape shots, this will be a superb addition to your collection. It isn't flashy, but it is one of the only motion picture glimpses some of us will ever see of this fine land (and you can only watch the Rick Steves version so many times). There is no narration, on-screen host, or trivia tidbit to be found  and that suits me just fine. My suggestion to the 1-star reviewer is to go on a day trip in his own country sometime, and maybe some of the locations will feel less random afterwards! Furthermore, I would remind him that some rural areas the world over are exactly the things he complains about: rainy green hills and sheep. Its a way of life, not just an idea for a reenactment village.

The program opens with a little bit of simple solo harp music playing over the ocean sounds and sights of Pembrokeshire. It then moves on to a few shots of castle ruins (and the gorgeous green landscapes that go with the territory). We get a precious sequence of the secluded Ystradfellte waterfall and its plain, soothing water sounds. Then for contrast, there are the quiet rolling hills and resident sheep of Berwyn, accompanied by more harp. Next comes Manorbier and its tranquil forest, with lush but lazy trees and a quiet little shaded lane. We then go back to the coast, to the lapping waters and rocky paths of St. Govans before dashing off to Henrhyd Falls (shot on a delightfully overcast day that somehow makes the rushing water more delightful). After that comes Cregennan Lakes, which frankly didn't look terribly special to me (but did look like a nice place to sit down for a quiet, solitary picnic), but thats just my own opinion.

The next sequence, Pistyll Rhaedyr, might remind you a little of Yorkshire on a very sunny day  we see plenty of trees, green hills, and cute little rivers, with birds happily tweeting to each otherand then some more babbling brooks and small waterfalls. Llyn Cwellyns peaceful lake greets us afterwards, proceeded by Dolwyddelan ruins in late afternoon and just before a storm (so there is artful thunder and a bit of rolling cloud to look forward to). Sheep peacefully graze in open fields nearby, apparently oblivious to the racket and the rain. Then comes the hills of Nebo (and more sheep, although their calls to each other offset the harp music nicely). We are then treated to Betws-y-coed (the fairy cove), not only a site with an apt name but also a totally pristine spot of Welsh wilderness. Various plurping, bubbling brooks (paired with light drizzle, methinks) are an equal treat for the senses.

Returning to the theme of ruins, Gwrych Castle serves as a mossy, picturesque reminder of the amount of history in Wales (as well as the ability of nature to make brick and stone and mortar look both reclaimed and accentuated by moss at the same time). Llyn Gwyants hunkered trees cast interesting shadows and silhouettes on a dancing lake that also serves as an impressionistic reflecting pool. One particular shot of a stone wall is perfectly Austenian, and you will be provoked into wondering of Jane Austen visited such a place when she wrote certain scenes of her novels.

Llanberis is similarly opulent without lifting a finger, as it were. Trees spread out as if to impress the viewer at what fine natural sculptures they are, even when their leaves are perfectly still. Mossy stones and brooks with pitch-black contents are a good complement to the beauty of the place. The sun winks through treetops like a sparkling star. Foreboding Dolbadarn Castle is a surprising contrast when you see a nearby glen that is both inviting and mysterious. We are then returned to Llanberis, this time to see Llanberis Falls.

Finally, to close the video out, we see Snowdonia (which I was expecting to see much more minutes devoted to since it is mentioned on the packaging blurb, but never mind). The whole area stretches out like a massive painting, and its not surprising that it has gained so much affection and fame. Foothills are punctuated by lavender skies and a red moon, which dissolve into the brief closing credits.

Yes, its true that no sequence is very in-depth. Some only last three or four minutes. Yet for a general overview of the natural beauty of a country, this one doesnt do the place any harm. Maybe my view is skewed because I only paid $4 for my specimen, I don't know.

The music is used somewhat sparingly, but this appears to have been a tactical move to emphasize the sounds of nature (and there are some charming ones in this program!). When the music does appear, it is mostly very simple stuff with a serene or slow lane feeling (which will probably either please you beyond measure or make you fall asleep, depending on your attitude). The choices for music are either solo harp or synthesizer-heavy ensembles (imitating a variety of instruments), but nothing sounds really dated.

Buyers should note that although the camera sequences are professional, crisp, and artful, there were no obvious filter tricks or a slow frame rate a la PBS Nature shows. I believe it also is not hi-definition (it does claim to be 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, but my TV isn't and I cant tell if the feature is a help or hindrance). None of these details are crucial to me, but the nit-pickers will doubtless complain about it. In my opinion, that does not make this program any less professional (it was probably just a budgetary issue). The copyright on this is 2010, so it isn't grainy old stock footage.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it might have been helpful if the menus either a.) had a map option of where the mentioned places are, or b.) had a chapter selection choice of the sequences by location/region of them in Wales. I enjoy looking at almost any nature footage of the U.K., but Im an outsider and have little concept of where things are geographically. Im not sure how much such features would enhance the experience, but I was definitely disappointed at the lack of this detail.",1396224000,5,6810,4.69907795473596
8445946,1,B004X2JNQI,"This is just a boring, slow video of landscapes which could be from anywhere in the uk.
There is no narrative or even textural history or explanation of any of the areas of the video of a great historical Country, sorry to repeat but, this is just a dumb very slow boring video of landscapes and the only thing moving are sheep and some music background sound.
Very disappointing , as there could have been so much more to tell.
Obviously made by someone who has no interest or knowledge of Wales.
