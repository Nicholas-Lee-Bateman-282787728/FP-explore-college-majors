8632724,5,B001P06JN6,Absolutely my new favorite comic! Lil Rel is hilarious!! I have seen him on a few shows but when I saw that he was on The Carmichael Show I began looking for videos that he'd done.  This did not disappoint!,1443139200,,206,4.15

8632727,5,B001P06JN6,"For the price... I bought it a few months back, it's low budget taping but I think Lil Rel is a very VERY funny comedian... NOW either he doesn't have alotta footage circulating, but it seems he uses the same jokes in evey stand up he does: The mama with a daddy voice, the jive talking dad, and the hoodrat 'on that 'Scato'! BUT no matter how many times I watch him, IT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH EVERY-SINGLE-TIME!!!

Hope to see Rel come out with more distributed stand-up soon!",1352937600,,476,4.348314606741573
