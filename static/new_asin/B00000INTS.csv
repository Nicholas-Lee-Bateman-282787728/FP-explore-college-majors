8164211,2,B00000INTS,"For a concert this size, one would expect professional filming. Both the audio and video are poorly done. I reccomend this only if your a fan of 60's mega concerts like Woodstock & just got to have it for your collection. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I must say Santana rocked, but don't they always.",1163030400,2,306,4.581818181818182
8164212,4,B00000INTS,"A rare vhs reissue of a classic hippy festival in Holland (1971). Pristine images and sounds but great performances by Roger Chapman & Family (not listed on the cover!), It's A Beautiful Day, Flock, Tyrannosaurus Rex (still as a duo), Pink Floyd (edited versions of Set The Controls & Saucerful Of Secrets), Dr. John in his famous voodoo phase, early Santana, late Byrds, Jefferson and others. Also featuring Grace Slick & Paul Kantner interviews. Often seen on film or continental tv broadcasts in the seventies, it's almost forgotten nowadays. Hopefully a dvd reissue will see the light of day but until now this is the only way to get it. A strange window into a distant past: recommended anyway.",1099440000,13,699,4.882352941176471
