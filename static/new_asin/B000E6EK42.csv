2499739,5,B000E6EK42,i won't ramble.  this is the finest TV series i've ever experienced.  now that they are gone i'll miss my 6FU family.,1141516800,5,117,4.2727272727272725
2499740,5,B000E6EK42,I have been waiting for the final season DVD to be released from the moment the credits ran on the final episode. SFU gripped me from the very first episode. So inovative and original. I did stray a bit as through season 4 the show seemed a little lost in my eyes. But I am glad that I came back for season 5. The final episode is the finest bit of tv work that I have ever seen. I plan to watch it over and over. Never have I been so moved by a tv show.,1141171200,13,454,3.7395833333333335
2499741,5,B000E6EK42,"WARNING:  If you haven't watched Season 5 yet, be VERY CAREFUL - some of your fellow Amazonians have peppered their reviews with spoilers, such as the (otherwise excellent) review by Lawrance M. Bernabo.  I will avoid spoilers here.

The 5th and final season of 6FU lets us spend 12 more hours with our friends Nate, David, Ruth, Claire, Brenda, and Keith.  Season 5 includes more of the great drama, great acting, and dark, off-beat humor that 6FU fans love so much.

Season 5 begins where Season 4 left off:  Nate and Brenda have decided to get married and have a baby.  As any 6FU fan could guess, neither of these events will go smoothly, nor will the decision to marry make their relationship suddenly problem-free.

Keith and David want children and are exploring adoption as well as hiring a surrogate.  One way or another, they will become successful in this endeavor, but will find that a child does not solve all their problems, but rather poses new challenges to each of them and their relationship with each other (just as in real life).

Toward the end of Season 4, Claire was starting to realize but not really accept that she might never be a great artist, and we saw her go down a spiral into depression and excessive drug use.  In Season 5, she starts to get a grip.  Having dropped out of art school, she gets a common office job through a temp agency, where she is totally out of her element - her coworkers vote Republican, use Splenda in their Mochaccinos, and hang out at chain restaurants like Chilis and Olive Garden.  This storyline results in interesting experiences and personal growth for Claire, and maybe a new relationship with someone she never would have expected to fall in love with.

Ruth's storylines mainly involve George.  You'll recall from Seasons 3 & 4, these two lovebirds rushed into marriage after a very brief but intense infatuation.  Then Ruth soon found out all kinds of nasty surprises about George - his many ex-wives, his lousy relationship with his children, and most of all, his extreme mental health problems which put a huge strain on his and Ruth's fledgling marriage.  In Season 5, Ruth and George go through more changes and eventually resolve the question of whether they will stay together.

Something BIG happens in the 8th or 9th episode, which sets up storylines and conflicts for the last 3 episodes.  If you care about these characters, it will affect you.

The final episode resolves each main character's central issue or conflict.  There is a final gathering at the dinner table and a memorial of sorts, and then the episode leaves you with a very bittersweet feeling as we say goodbye to each of our friends forever.

I do not believe Season 5 is the best season of this excellent show.  I'm not sure that the writing is as consistently excellent as in past seasons.  A few of the characters' plot arcs from previous seasons are recycled in Season 5.  For example, how many times do we have to watch Billy go off his meds and become annoying and dangerous to the people who love him?  Don't worry, I'm not giving anything away here - you'll see it coming a mile away.  Other multi-episode story arcs bring old demons back to haunt Nate and David, when we'd thought they had dealt with and resolved these issues in previous seasons.

But these are relatively minor quibbles.  Mostly, Season 5 is very, very good, and a fine finish to an outstanding series.  After the last episode, you'll feel sad that this show is over, and you'll miss these characters.

Finally, I think the price is way too high for a mere 12 episodes.  HBO is very greedy for charging so much.  Other networks typically charge 40-50 bucks for a season with almost twice as many episodes.  At the high prices HBO charges for shows like 6FU and Sopranos, many viewers will opt to rent from Netflix rather than buy, and greedy HBO ends up being worse off in the end.",1140393600,128,3904,4.6346433770014555
2499742,5,B000E6EK42,"What can be said about this show that hasn't been said already?  It is the GREATEST show ever on American television.  That's an extremely bold statement I know, but watch it and just try and prove me wrong!

Am I sad that it's over?  Yes, but at the same time they ended the show with extreme quality.  Also upon re-watching of the 1st season, I see that the whole show was clearly one big story arc of Nate trying to find himself, and how his family and friends change because of his quest.

The final episode of the series was truly the greatest final episode of all time!  I've never seen a show's ending be so complete and yet still be so perfect for the general theme of the show.

I've written long pieces on what the show truly means before, but for now I'll just end with this:

Six Feet Under is NOT ""a show about death"". It's a show about how people carry on after the loss of a loved one.  In fact this show highlights (truthfully I might add) that a person doesn't truly die until everyone who knew him/her has died, because their memory still affects the living.  That's why I feel that ""Everything Ends"" is an inappropriate slogan for this series. ""Everything Continues"" is much more appropriate and accurate.

R.I.P Six Feet Under, 2001-2005

""Gone, but most certainly not forgotten.""",1140307200,15,1300,4.480851063829787
2499743,5,B000E6EK42,"When I heard the dreaded news that this season was going to be the last I was very sad. I have watched this show from the beginning and I have always found it to be funny, sad and at times a teacher.  As this season progressed I was drawn closer to the charachters than I have ever been.  I could not see how they were going to end this!  Even as the last episode began, I was leary of an ending worthy of this show.  Well, I was blown away.  It was everything I wanted and more.  I cried for 15 minutes after the show was over and the next 20 times I watched it.  It was perfect.

I can't wait to see this season over again.  I am going to spend the day watching it from beginning to the end with tissue box in hand.",1140220800,9,717,3.856164383561644
2499744,5,B000E6EK42,"As an australian, we don't get to see the series on tv , just the odd episode here and there, i own season one to four on dvd and i am so looking forward to owning season 5. A friend of mine in new york taped the show for me and i have to say i have never been so moved watching those last few episodes.  You could just feel all the emotion coming right out of the tv.  It was the best tv show i have ever seen , sad  it ended but it could not of ended better.",1138752000,10,460,3.58
2499745,5,B000E6EK42,"I'm so glad that the final season of ""Six Feet Under"" is finally coming out on DVD. So far I only own Season 1, but I'm probably going to buy Season 5 before I complete the rest of my collection. Unlike many shows, ""Six Feet Under"" really shined during its final season. (I'm going to give away some spoilers now, so stop reading this if you don't want to know all the details of Season 5!)

The series could not have ended any better...I was so pleased with the way things turned out. From the moment Nate said ""Narm,"" I knew he was going to bite it before the show ended. It was very sad to watch the death of one of my favorite characters, but it was so incredibly well done and the show did an amazing job of showing how the rest of the family coped with Nate's passing and moved on.

The final episode of the season is incredible. The only way to end a show like ""Six Feet Under"" is to show how all the characters eventually died, and that's exactly what happened. The final 15 minutes of the last episode are amazing...I think I watched the death montage about 50 times right after it first aired. Rumor has it that there is going to be an extended death montage on the DVD so we can see how some of the other characters like Billy and Margaret die. I can't wait to see that!

It sucks that ""Six Feet Under"" only lasted for five seasons, but it followed such a great story arc and extending the show would have ruined it. At least we can shell out an insane amount of money for the DVDs (seriously, HBO, you're robbing us blind here!) and enjoy the show forever.",1138320000,15,1568,4.20265780730897
2499746,5,B000E6EK42,"Going into the fifth season of ""six feet under"" I knew two things: a) that this was going to be the final year and that b) the fourth season seems really out of place for me.  I honestly had no idea what to expect, but I kept watching and the main pattern that I noticed was that teh show was getting... almost tedious (for lack of a better word).  It seemed like the writters where finally having to really scrap to get the good stories.

But then in the middle of the season an event happend that took the show in such a jurasic new direction, the quality instantly jumped and successfuly succeded the second season as the most interesting, thought pervoking, and plain weird group of episodes  I have ever watched.

And then the finale, ""Everybody's Waiting"" is a fan's wet dream when it comes to series finale.  TV history has not been kind to series finale's to major series (i.g. most of them suck ass).  But ""Six Feet Under"", like everything else, is the exception to the rule.  Over the course of the 75 minutes I cried, laughed, got scared, and help and overwhelimging sense of completion and joy where it comes from the character's arcs.  And the last 10 minutes I will never forget as Long as I live, it was so haunting (in a good way).",1138147200,50,1247,4.386956521739131
2499747,5,B000E6EK42,"Woah I am stoked after completes this show. Music is just straight out awesome.  And I would give my own personal Oscar to each of the main actors and actress's in there.  It's a show thats young enough that I would not show it to my parents, and old enough that people in high school would not fully appreciate and understand.  In other words perfect for young adults thats trying to grasp the reality and mystery of life.

It's a show about life( and death a part of it), in particular American lives.  There are death through out the whole show and how it affects the charaters around it.  It is interesting for one to see how much some charaters grew(maturally) through out the show and some stays the same.  The ending is a bit too perfect for me but it's something that I would watch over and over again (where Clair drives off and the music kicks in with few scenes from the future).  And the future Clair looks extrodinarily beautiful and peaceful (as though she truely found serenity within this world) compare to the Clair thats in the first episode.

Anyway this is my own personal thoughts after watching the show, what's left for the audience after watching the show is definitly worth something to ponder about.",1137628800,10,1225,4.557077625570776

2499782,5,B000E6EK42,"I watched the show DEXTER before this program, which also starred Michael C. Hall. Both of these share similar themes -- the most obvious being an attitude toward death. Both feature powerful endings.
At first, I had a crush on Brenda, but, later, developed an interest in Maggie, George's daughter. She does, as mentioned, provide a contrast with the temperamental Brenda who, for a while, is sleeping around behind Nate's back. (Spoiler alert) The scene where Maggie and Nate finally have a sexual encounter was compelling and quite touching for me. Of course, we know that tragic way that scene ends.
The ending was certainly different, but since I had invested so heavily in the characters, I was devastated.
Claire is my favorite character in the show, followed, toward the end, by Maggie.
I don't imagine there will be another show like this, unless, if the rumors are true,  David Lynch brings out a continuation of TWIN PEAKS.",1426377600,,934,4.9113924050632916

2499809,4,B000E6EK42,"Not since Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman have I ever been so compelled to
watch a non-fiction television series. I made the mistake of the power
marathon over a long weekend watching ALL five seasons and going to
sleep with that theme song in my poor little noodle. I could not stop
watching, it was that engaging and stimulating. Of course there were
many issues with the first season comparison but can you imagine
American Beauty 2?? Of course not, hence the ability to continuously
create story lines, magical celebrations of life and death would be
equally intractable.

I have been to several funeral homes to make arrangements for loved
ones and do not believe that every customer would engage a complete
stranger and spill every deep emotion and details portrayed in this
series. I guess that is my one pointer for not showing a more realistic
business like attitude that most customers would exhibit. I however
have fallen completely apart at certain crucial ceremonies but never in
the hands of a funeral director let alone assistant.

I have never made any plans for my future demise but this series made
me consider many choices. If I had my dream funeral it would have been
the Puccini Nessun Dorma theatrical Turandot production, jaw dropping
heartfelt emotional and visual tempest.

I did find the gay couple sex overwhelming in the first season, despite
my warm acceptance of Brokeback, and many other same sex relationship
films. I feel they toned done those types of scenes in later seasons
and was truly joyful during the wedding ceremony portrayed in the
finales last moments.

My favorite episode has to be the biker funeral with Nate inheriting
his ticket to freedom and being on the road albeit with no helmet! As a
rider who had to give up this hobby it was especially moving. Always
superb music selections even to the end, had never heard of Sia.

Still processing some of the symbolism, i.e. Nate jumping in his white
suit with sunglasses rather out of context imho and Claire's wedding
ceremony guests.

I hope it will not take another 40 years to enjoy another phenomenal
series. Guess I will have to settle for the Simpsons presently...sigh.",1401408000,,2167,4.8432432432432435

Even now, judging SFU against some powerful television---TV having long surpassed film as the best media experience---I can say unequivocally that SFU is the best series ever made for TV. Certainly, there were some rough spots along the way, like the implausibility of the last episodes of the Lisa story. I think the producers wanted to get rid of the Lisa factor, but their creativity should have enabled them to give us a better story line. And, yes, there were some soap operatic moments. But on the whole, it was a great big amazing slice of life--- and death---that is unforgettable. And, as others have said, the wrap-up in the series finale was awesome.

2499837,5,B000E6EK42,"For some reason I was completely put-off by Season 4's fairly unrealistic events, but the final season returned to the intelligent presentation of human behavior and deep relationship issues that were presented on film so brilliantly in the first three seasons, that I am glad I stuck with it and returned to watch the finale.

Never before has death and dying, and modern society's toll and realism regarding family and love, been so openly dealt with in an intelligently and well written/acted fashion as this brilliant HBO series (one of several they have produced) exhibits.

Divorce, homosexuality, drug use, death...for most it's something avoided when it comes to TV and film, but SFU offers an entertaining way of forcing people to deal with their emotions by becoming intimately involved with characters they can relate to and see themselves in...we're all human beings and we've all suffered the emotional pulls and pitfalls all of these people have throughout our lives...and it reminds us of how we so often avoid dealing with death and the loss of relationships, friends, lovers and family.  Yet this family and those around them are constantly confronted with reality and life's questions and spiritual meaning by way of owning and being connected to those who run a funeral home.

Season 5 is full of great acting/actors, dynamic and developed characters that you care about, and you'll be hard-pressed to not get emotional during ""Ecotone,"" one of the best representations of expressing grief in today's world you'll ever experience...but again it's not something to be avoided because of its subject-matter, it's just real and powerful, versus simply shallow TV drama squeezed out between commercials (thank God there are none, which makes it a completely different, worthwhile endeavor).

So glad that I came back and watched Season 5, it's endearing and an incredibly fitting ending to the series, well done Alan Ball and all of the actors/actresses that made this series a classic everyone should watch...a real microcosmic reflection of American society trying to deal with what they've created over the last 50 years.

In the fifth and final season, the Fishers indeed wrap up and end their lives.  At the beginning of the season they are miserable and hopeless, as they approach the end they become more hopeful and at peace.  Ruth deals with her mentally ill husband George.  Keith and Brenda marry apparently unhappily or with anxiety, David and Keith search for children to adopt, Lauren has to decide whether to deal with Billy as a lover or someone else, and Maggie, George's daughter finds another woman's husband attractive.

2499855,2,B000E6EK42,"You pretty much have to be a devoted fan not to notice how badly this series deteriorated over five years.  By the fifth season you are just hoping the producers will put this dysfunctional family out of its misery, as nothing seems to go right for the Fishers, especially young Nate who never seemed to regain his footing after the death of Lisa.  What started with so much promise, ends pretty sadly, as the writers struggled mightily to draw this series to a close.

Nate Jr. was never very convincing.  You never do figure out where all his rage came from, other than frustration with his own failings.  The one good thing, his daughter Maya, which he keeps reminding everyone of, gets tossed around like a rag doll through seasons five as Nate tries to settle into some kind of life.  But, even when it seems he is finally able to resolve himself with Brenda, it doesn't last long.  It doesn't seem the guy deserved the second chance he got at the beginning of Season Three.

The other family members are harder to pin down.  Ruth seems to go through many of the same struggles when it comes to finding an ideal mate.  George showed promise, but soon we find out he is harboring some kind of dementia and their relation quickly sours.  Bettina comes around from time to time to cheer her up, but Ruth just can't seem to find happiness.

David can't seem to completely reconcile himself with Keith, even when it comes to adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogate mother.  You would think they had the ideal opportunity to make something happen with Keith's niece, Taylor, which David seemed very warm toward, but I guess the writers wanted to take this relationship through a few more twists and turns, leaving this viewer to wonder what it was all about.  For what had been arguably the best homosexual couple portrayed on television, they don't seem to find much happiness in each other.

Just when Claire seemed to have some balance in her life, the floor falls out from under her in a rather unconvincing set of episodes following the tragic fate of Nate.  Claire had always been the most promising character.  Her bright cheery face lit up the increasingly morbid episodes, but eventually even Claire falls into a rather depressed state of affairs as her glimmering hope as an artist all too quickly flames out and she is forced to work as a temp secretary.  The writers lavished a lot of attention on her in the end, but her catharsis seemed rather phoney.

Alan Ball and his large crew of writers and directors appeared to have lost their way at the end of Season Three and never were able to regain it.  There are a few good episodes and fun situations, but the combination of unusual dramatic situations and dark humor that characterized the first three seasons gave way to a morbid melodrama in the end, with the actors seeming to have an increasingly hard time breathing new life into their roles.  So it goes.",1257984000,9,2937,4.598848368522073

Then I basically devoured Seasons 2-5 in over a month or so; and by the end of it, I can honestly say the series had changed my perspective on the way I look at many things.
It's an experience, really. One worth experiencing. See for yourself. You can thank me later!

P.S. I guess that ending is one of the best endings for a TV series ever, isn't it? It's only natural... but so damn emotional and perfect.",1233792000,6,649,4.110236220472441
2499858,5,B000E6EK42,"It's a struggle for me not to give this season my ""10/10 Classic"" rating, because the last handful of episodes--the ones I've seen most recently, so which naturally have the biggest impact--were nearly perfect.  However, the season as a whole did indeed have some minor blips that keep it from being as great a collection as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Three/dp/B0007R4SWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Three</a>&nbsp;or as consistent as the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-two-seasons/dp/B0001M3MZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first two seasons</a>.  However, as I said before, the way this season--and series--ends is quite beautiful, and those episode leading up to the pitch perfect swan song do, indeed, make up for the awkwardness of the way the season started.

After the somewhat weaker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fourth-season/dp/B0009NZ2W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fourth season</a>, ""Six Feet Under"" bounces back with more beautiful and hilarious episodes showing the Fishers and those around them struggling with death in brand new, heart-wrenching ways.  As stated before, the first few episodes of this season do indeed have the directionless feeling that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fourth-season/dp/B0009NZ2W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fourth season</a>&nbsp;suffered from.  However, even when it's at its weakest, there is such intelligence and heart put into the writing and, at another level, a bubbling tension that makes you know they're building up to something bigger and tragic.  And indeed they are.

From the shocking ""Ecotone,"" to ""All Alone,"" a perfect dissection of grief that, quite frankly, is better than any literature, to the series finale ""Everyone's Waiting,"" this show hit its high note in the end, surpassing the brilliance that had been achieved in earlier seasons.  By the time you're watching that final goodbye montage, you'll have forgotten all about the weaker moments earlier in the season.  I very much recommend this, but only if the show is watched in order, from start to finish.

It's not a perfect season, and it's not a 10/10.  But it's damn close.  Perhaps it's not consistent, but each episode has something hilarious, something smart, and something beautiful, and even at it's weakest, it's better than most everything else on television.  I'll miss this show dearly, because not only are the character's one of a kind, the show itself is one of the top five of all time.  Creator Alan Ball has gained a life-time fan.

Six Feet Under was a terrific show.  Maybe my all-time favorite, at least in my top 5.  It kept me up at night, just to watch one more episode to see what was going to happen.  I was addicted, each episode was fascenating to me.

2499873,5,B000E6EK42,"As a person normally totally disillusioned and turned off by commercial television per se, ""Six Feet Under"" was something out of the ordinary that revived some hope within me that commercial television could actually produce outstanding programs of real value if it wanted to. Accolades must go to HBO for that, as they've been responsible for some other gems apart from ""Six Feet Under"". ""Angels In America"" and ""Wit"" come immediately to mind. However, this review is of the final season of ""Six Feet Under"" when in the true spirit of the show all things came to an end.  I remember watching ""Six Feet Under"" for the first time on cable TV in Taiwan when I was living and working there a few years ago. It just captivated me with its sheer audacity, honesty and moments of quiet reflection.  The program struck a resonance, potentially within us all, as to the frailty,imperfection, and finality of the human condition. The final season, after some wayward moments in season 3 and 4, brought  a conclusiveness to the program that it needed. None of us wanted it to end but knew it had to. It would have been crass if it had continued on in some other form.  Alan Ball is to be congratulated for his timing and insight with his bringing the series to an end. We all had our favourites in the series, Keith, Claire, and to a degree Nate for me. None of the characters were perfect but their imperfections if anything endeared them to us because we knew in many ways we shared those imperfections. Season 5 logically picks up  where Season 4 left off and there's no reason to revive explanations of that here.  The last 4 programs in series 5 are what captivates and makes the final season really worth it.  The last program has some truly moving moments in it.  For instance, the scene where the Fisher family members remember Nate in their own way and toast his memory, with the closing drawing away camera shot of the family dining table and David's quiet, almost inaudible, ""May he rest in peace"" murmur.  Then Brenda and Nate being reconciled - in a dreamlike state -over their new baby, and one of the final scenes in the last episode where Nate leans over to Claire and whispers in her ear that the moment has already gone when she's about to take a photo of the family group before departing. I was a bit unsure about the closing montage at first but on subsequent viewings have come to appreciate its value to the ending of the show. Season 5 is a real gem of television making. Ruth ,in my opinion, becomes totally selfish and abandons George - tough though the task was for her. Nate, comes to the realisation after years of struggle with Brenda that perhaps they weren't just meant to be together, then dies. Reliable Keith keeps things together with David, and Claire - lovely and ever hopeful as usual- matures and ends the series with her moving on and out of the family home. Anyway, they're just my thoughts of the key players and I'm sure other people who appreciated the series would see it otherwise. As one reviewer of this dvd set said, it's hard to believe that the series has finally ended. It will be sorely missed, amongst the wasteland of television.  To that end, thanks must go to Alan Ball for his excellence in bringing the show together - long may he prosper.  Finally, I want to comment on the emotional so called incidental music used in the series. It was perfect for enhancing moments of quiet reflection.  The opening title sequences will be well remembered also.",1184457600,,3498,4.5881410256410255

I cannot tell you how much this series touched me.  It really gave me insights into both life and death.  I grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them.  They made me look at my own life in a new way.

The final three episodes are the best three episodes of any TV show, ever.  I seriously spent almost the entire last three episodes crying.  They were so wonderful and I LOVED the ending of the very last episode.  As stated by previous commenters, it was the best ending of a series EVER!

The quality of the plot in this final season is very uneven, as you may have read earlier.

But, BUT, why is it that the last 5 minutes of the last episode keep replaying in my head since I saw it ? Because it was, without a doubt, the most MOVING end to a show that I have ever seen. It says ""those are not TV characters, those are humans beings like you and me"". It will probably leave you quite sad, but so hopefull at the same time that it is hard to explain (specially without detailling what the end is).

have to admit some bits in season 4 like Nathans wife getting killed, and then the discovered affair was a bit far out from what would be beleivable. but nonetheless the show is deep, and really reaches out to you and makes you relate in some way to the characters, no matter who you are.

Sad to see it go in season 5.

Wouldve liked to see them all well into thier golden years...for certain their outrageous and issue driven complexities would never cease to reach out to the audience and stir us deep inside",1175040000,,600,4.486238532110092

I worried quite a bit during season 4 that the series had jumped the shark; David's abduction episode was particularly bad for me, because I found myself thinking, ""What family on Earth has this many catastrophes happen to them in this short amount of time?"" But the 5th and final season put my doubts to rest.

I don't have cable TV anymore, so I watched the final season entirely on DVD last summer (it is now winter of 2007). This has been the best season yet. They managed to tie up loose ends, and yet it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel forced or over-the-top.

This season has had some of the most haunting, affecting, and powerful television that I've ever seen. The final sequence of the final episode, as many people have mentioned, is BY FAR the best television I have ever seen. I often think about it still, and it's been nearly a year since I've seen the episode. Still gives me goosebumps when I talk about it.

I get goosebumps just thinking about it.  As a film student and former broadcaster who not only studied media but later worked in the 'biz,' I can say with assurance that the last 15 minutes of the final episode will take your breath away, again and again. As the countdown to 6FU's final showing evolved, I wondered how the writers and producers could bring this fabulous series to a close. To use an often overused technical term--WOW!

There will be no series to follow, the producers et al have made sure we understand that as they firmly nail the coffin shut. Of all the shows I've watched on DVD over the past four years, this is the best by far. (I never got into the Sopranos though so, I could be flawed in that analysis by what I understand is also a highly admired series) All the way through Six Feet Under the charactors, whether small or large roles, are so well developed. Fantastic acting, is buoyed by great scripts and dialogue, direction and the general feel and look of the whole set piece. Everyone involved must be proud of their imput and achievement.

Now the question is: are you up to that change or not? Are you willing to go beyond your material perceptions? In other words, are you ready to discover your true self?

I watched all 5 seasons of SFU back to back in about 2 months. Those months coincided with watching movies like ""what the bleep do we know"" and some other metaphysical documentaries? The timing was NO coincidence. The impact of SFU just penetrated to the depth of my heart and essence.

And then you wonder: is this really made by human beings? Then you discover the splendor of creativity and innovation in humans.

And at the end, a personal story: I finished the last episode of Season five (last SFU ever made) in Amsterdam's airport, on my way back to Iran (my homeland) after 10 years. I just couldn't hold myself back and wept throughout the whole 1 hour of that episode. Some Dutch gathered around me when they saw me crying that way and couldn't help but watch it with me on my laptop. By the way, that was my second time watching that episode.

2499900,5,B000E6EK42,"In todays world of film and tv, which I rarely watch. (I don't have cable- rent the occasional flick.. and all the Six Feet Under Episodes) Six feet under is necessary. It's vital, so human and so real. I mean it may be described as surreal... but LIFE is that way.. it is. Honestly I don't know what to say- i just finished the last season last night and am in denial that it is over. I grew so attached to every single character- mainly becuase of thier flaws and their humanity which we are always let in on. I was so engrossed with the family, that with the (not giving away details) ""action"" that transgressed in the 5th season, I was... well this is sort of embarassing but i went into a serious state of denial. I have grown so deeply attached to these folks that their grief was my own. I sobbed deeply through the last three episodes. From first watching the first season I dream of the characters. My fiance and I are getting married in Febraruy and we fantasize about having all of 6ft under there.

I don't usually obsess over television. This is an exception. And I can only hope that more endeavours of such high creative standard continue to wow and really inform us. Six feet under reminds us of mortality- which if we truly consider might change how we do things in this world- might enable and empower us to risk to be happy before we die.

I reccommend this series without hesitation and think I might start watching again from the beginning now....

Sometimes the occasional episode spanning its five seasons seemed amiss, but the cast members...every one of them...always delivered maximum and wholly believable performances. ""Six Feet Under"" set itself apart and redeemed itself mightly in its fifth and final season. Human life, as we all know too well is not an uncomplicated thing and Alan Ball, the creator of this inspired series reached deep inside himself in calling upon all his creative powers and gifts to write and direct the magnificent closing opus. The final episode was entirely satisfying in its profoundly moving yet deeply disturbing way. The unfolding imagery of the final few minutes will resonate with me for the rest of my days. I don't think I will ever again view death and funerals and loss and sorrow in the same way.  The series effectively conveyed something dark and unspoken about our culture and its collective, even repressed attitude towards the subject of death. I believe ""Six Feet Under"" will be long remembered with some measure of respect for its frank discussion of a fundamentally sensitive topic. I am grateful to all those creative people who had a hand in its production. Demonstrating exceptional craft and seemingly effortless skill, virtually all the gifted cast members somehow managed to insinuate themselves into a special niche within my psyche, at times seeming to be virtual extended family. Thank you for leaving this lasting impression and thank you HBO.

2499903,5,B000E6EK42,"Six Feet Under captivated me since Season 1, and I have religiously collected every season on DVD (due to most irresponsible TV programming - that was the only way I could truly enjoy one of the best TV dramas I have ever seen). But Season 5 captivated, absorbed and affected me more than any other season. Rarely has storytelling been so gripping, so real and so emotional.

It is unnecessary for me to reiterate any part of the show - we are all familiar with the characters, the story; we avid Six Feet Under watchers know the ""Six Feet Under"" feeling all too well. Yet, I am compelled to express my thoughts. I thought I was going to savour season 5 an episode a day, but when it got to around episode 6 (of a total of 12), I just couldn't stop. As I sit here with Sia's ""Breathe Me"" playing in the background, I recollect the experience of watching Six Feet Under season 5, and how my life had chanced brushing upon this exceptional masterpiece - the memories are all at once warm and cold, painful but cherished, in one word - bittersweet.

Episodes that I truly enjoyed (that's a bit of a lie, because I actually enjoyed all 12) on this season are episode 6 ""The Rainbow of Her Reasons"", and the last 3 episodes. Episode 6 for its hilarity; Claire singing her complaints of wearing pantyhose to the tune of ""You Light Up My Life"" and when one of Ruth's friends (played brilliantly by Patricia Clarkson) calls herself evil for `causing' the death of another friend, and somehow managing to stick ""George f**king Bush"" into her emotionally-charged rant (that for some reason made me laugh). The last 3 episodes were heart wrenching to say the least. Partly because it was so flawlessly scripted and convincingly acted by the magnificent cast. Partly because you've grown so attached to the characters that you feel their grief. But also partly because it all seemed so real, like this could one day happen to you. It's extremely painful to realize that, but you know what you know and sometimes to know is a double-edged sword. I guess that's why so many relate to Six Feet Under. It deals with real human life themes. Yes, its quirky, occasionally weird and downright depressing - but isn't all that part of life?

At the end of the day, Six Feet Under makes great television. But it's not something that leaves you empty handed. Six Feet Under floors you. It's right in your face. It makes you think things that you would have otherwise taken for advantage of or simply overlooked. And Six Feet Under reminds us that death is inevitable. And that we should all cherish people that we love so deeply, and that we should be who we want to be, and that we ought to do what we want to do (as long as it's legal; the law sits above human desires, you see). I loved every moment watching Six Feet Under. It's a great TV show that has meticulously framed shots that are mesmerizing to look at, great music and a voice that speaks ever so loudly (and most unashamedly) of life and death.

As the tagline goes ""Everywhere. Everyone. Everything. Ends"". And so Six Feet Under should come to an end. But I'm sure it will continue to haunt me.

2499915,3,B000E6EK42,"Six Feet Under started out as one of the best TV shows around. 3D characters with complex emotional issues that drew you in because they were so believable.

By the time this season has come around, the characters have become 2D sterotypes. The reaction to Nate's death by his family was SO out of synch with season 1 or 2 that I felt I was watching a different show. It's good writing, but not great - and that is the difference between the first season and the last.

2499917,1,B000E6EK42,"OK, first, let's get a grip on exactly what this show was:  a soap opera, a melodrama, a potboiler.  Yes, all drama is conflict, even all comedy.  But compelling drama takes us on a ride; the writers, actors and director entertain us, and in some cases (but not this one) even force us to question our established beliefs.  This show took us on that ride, providing soapy entertainment for the first three seasons; but then the ride started going in tired circles, providing conflict without dramatic tension, only more yelling and crying and sex and actions seemingly driven by nothing more than the screenwriter's need to fill the pages.  While Six Feet Under never activated the centers of higher reasoning in my own brain, it seems to have taken others on a flight of mystical self-discovery.  Well, I guess that's preferable and less disturbing to friends and family than their actually joining a creepy cult.  Case in point:  our nutsy friend above from Newquay, jewel of the Cornish Riviera and surfing capital of England, who lashes out at anyone who won't join him in his puddle of tears over the passing of ""his show,"" calling them stupid.  He says they don't get the point of the show, then fails to mention just what that point is.  When a show delves into the scary subject of mortality it has an almost unfair advantage upon our attention.  And some of us, in the glare of our television screens, forget that anyone addressing the subject is just speculating and knows nothing more about the subject than we do.",1160611200,7,1525,4.716981132075472

It's truly transformative!  I found my mind moving at the speed of light in an attempt to grasp its depth and spiritual meaning (although I am not the leaat bit religious).  I was totally in awe of this wonderfully moving way of ending the series.  SIX FEET UNDER not only demystified death, it made the concept of dying as natural and full of adventure as our navigation through life.  We'll miss all the quirky and imperfect characters in the series, but for me they will continue to pop in my head for years to come.

Without spoiling the story for anybody (some other reviewers have done that job fairly well), I can say this much: the attachment to any of the characters you may have developed after four seasons, along with the fun moments you've experienced with some of them, will take things to a new level as you are dragged along with the family (almost like one of them) to some of the saddest moments ever experienced in TV.

I guess in my case too, it could have been the death of my dad, who passed away around the time the fifth season was actually getting  aired, but I wept like I haven't in quite a while through some of the last season's episodes, as the lives of the characters were spinned for good, in a way none was prepared for (not even the viewers).

Season five was a culmination of many themes. Some endings were happy and others not so much. Regardless, some of the episodes in this season were among the best I've ever watched in television in my life. The first episode and the last four especially were brilliant.

The episode All Alone is perhaps my favorite ever. For someone like myself who has lived through many significant deaths, this episode hit home like nothing I have ever seen. I cried my way through the entire thing. Still, I feel as though that hour went a long way to heal my own pain of lost loved ones. The final episode indeed was one of the best finales ever on tv.

Never thought SFU will have this effect on me since I always felt the characters were a little ""drama queen"", and the whole thing about ""talking to dead people"" is kind of freaky.

Those 7 minutes made movie/TV history.

There's only 1 flaw with the ending: Who in their righ mind would buy a new car before moving to NYC?

But I am glad that Claire did. If she boarded a plane, the ending would be nowhere near as powerful.

  I must admit that the first episode of the season will prove to be somewhat of a surprise- at least it was for me. Flash-forward a few months and then the season starts with George gone postal and Nate and Brenda's wedding/baby crisis. It's a little ackward to just put you there- but still good. In repsect to how season 5 adds up to the others- it's mixed. Season 5 does (as previously stated) provide awesome closure in the best way possible to the series- but it seems most of the characters spend the season slumped and very depressed. Most definately Brenda and Ruth. Not to say it's unfitting, on account of their circumstances- but it's a little different and takes some getting used to.

The characters were genuine, the situations fascinatingly bizarre, and when you have it all take place around the subject of death, dying and the many peculiar customs and beliefs we attach to the end of life, you have the makings of a cool cult show that you just have to keep and watch all over again.  Season Five is worth it for the ending episode alone...and, as always, the soundtrack is impeccably appropriate.  Losing these characters was tantamount to suffering the death of someone ""real;"" and, in many respects, good fiction can make imaginary characters more authentic and inspiring than many of the flesh-and-blood people one encounters on a daily basis.

2499934,5,B000E6EK42,"The fifth and final season of HBO's groundbreaking series Six Feet Under brings closure to the story of the Fisher family in such a brilliant way that it's got to be considered among the very best conclusions to any television show ever.

As the fifth season begins, it develops the new stages in the lives of each of the Fishers: Nate and Brenda entering married life, David attempting to start a family with Keith, Ruth struggling to adjust to her husband George's new mental state and Claire's evergrowing conflicts both in her relationship with Billy and her art. The first half of the season compellingly sets up the characters' conflicts with an uneasy and rather disturbing foreboding that something big will happen that will turn the Fisher family's world upside down and change them forever.

And something HUGE does happen halfway through the season, indeed. I will not reveal what it is, but it will not only shake the Fishers to their very core; it will also force them to face their deepest inner demons, make them come to terms with the reality of loss, and eventually help them move on with their lives.

The entire final season is excellent and the acting (Frances Conroy and Lauren Ambrose are especially fantastic), directing, writing and production values are outstanding throughout, but what elevates this season to something truly extraordinary are the last 5 episodes or so, which have got to be the best run of episodes in the show's history. Shocking, morbidly funny, beautiful, tragic, disturbing, spiritual and heartbreaking; one after the other, these final episodes will leave the viewer intensely involved and emotionally drained. The final episode in particular, ends the show with such a sense of closure, satisfaction and completeness to the characters and their lives in all its encompassing happiness, sadness, tragedy and fulfillment that is so tremendously moving, eloquent and trascendental, it will likely leave you in tears.

A truly perfect and unforgettable way to end one of the best shows to ever grace the small screen.",1150848000,4,2063,5.0588235294117645

Six Feet Under is quite unique in the fact that it is one those rare shows for television that does not deteriorate in the final few seasons, but in fact gets better and better with every passing year. Most shows start with a good concept, but very few manage to keep the quality of the show as good as SFU does throughout, maintaining the interest of viewers fresh and alive for the duration.

The final episode of the season and of the overall show, is a master stroke ending by Alan Ball. I watched three times in a row and it had my heart in its clutches for days after. Such a moving and powerful ending.

If there is such a thing as a TV show d'auteur, SFU is it. I am sure that it will be classified as a classic novel for television for years to come.",1150588800,6,967,4.2967032967032965

I had long been a fan of the series and watched the finale rather awkwardly, on Video-on-Demand while eating lunch, and by the end, I found myself bawling, my lunch untouched in front of me.  The entire final season is great, but wow . . . I was more moved by the final episode than I have been by any film or show in longer than I can remember.

No other show has touched upon how our awareness of our mortality and how grieving through loss can ultimately enrich the lives we live now. This is powerful and deeply thoughtful stuff, and the final episode, without getting into particulars, is especially heart wrenching and unforgettable. Anyone with a trace of humanity will be affected by the finale's beauty and deeply felt emotions. It also marks the death of the show itself, and that in itself is especially sad. The finale made me realize how close I felt to the characters, and seeing them go was truly a wrenching experience. I cried and was deep in thought long, long after the credits rolled.

Following Nate, Brenda, Claire (and all the characters) was truly like spending time with family and friends.  And this final season really did deliver everything the series promised from the very fair airing of the series premiere.

A ""must watch"" show for anyone wanting powerful, emotional and extremely well written television viewing.  Highly recommended!

2499941,4,B000E6EK42,"Not having HBO, I came into Six Feet Under late, while I was a district manager for a small, local chain of video stores, after the hearty endorsement of several good customers. Taking their word, I rented and watched the entire first season with my girlfriend over a long weekend getaway.

I don't know if we'd have felt the same way about the show, having to watch each episode play out over the course of an entire season, as opposed to being able to watch a season at a time on DVD, one after another; therefore keeping each show fresh in our minds. But needless to say, we were hooked, and we've burned through the first four seasons in less than a year.

Six Feet Under might never be regarded as classic television, but I've been affected by it, despite a noted dip in quality this last couple years, as the show often devolved into soap opera-ish clich's, where often every scene seemed to consist of tantrums and fights and bed-hopping instead of digging into the heart of the Fisher family and the themes that were so central to the shows early success: the cycle of birth, life, and death, and the Fisher's (and in effect, our culture's) attitudes towards them.

Fortunately even during the low points there was plenty to keep us hooked: Nate and Brenda and their co-dependency and completely dysfunctional familial relationships; David and Keith, possibly the deepest, best written homosexual roles ever in a mainstream television series (or film, for that matter); Ruth, and all of her relationship woes, especially with second husband George; and finally Claire, and her slow coming of age. More often than not, bits and pieces of each episode have stayed with me, playing in my mind, often days after watching them.

Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. And for better or worse we've come to the fifth and final season of this crazy, intimate little show about a family of funeral directors.

The first thing that struck me while watching season five was that the show seemed to suddenly get back on track, even while the annoying character traits (all the constant bickering and quick-sex-fixes-everything mentality) were still present. And as the series began to wind down and on-going plot lines were tied up, I began to realize how much these goofy characters had grown to mean to me. If you can consider fictional people family, well, with all their exaggerated faults and foibles, these folks were darn close.

So what comes around goes around. Creator/producer Alan Ball returns to write and direct the last episode of his brainchild.

Without spoiling too much here (apologies to those of you who are haven't yet finished!), after Nate's death, I was glad to see the entire family finally come together: to see Ruth grieve and then heal after the loss of her favored son, become the nurturing matriarch of the Fisher family, and then ease into her own life apart from her children; to see David finally come to grips with his own inner demons (figuratively and literally) and settle in with a family of his own; to see Rico and Vanessa reconcile, then break away from the Fishers for a new beginning; and again, Claire, as she finally began to grow up and move away from the safety of the family roost and out into the big, bright world.

After watching this last show, I was left drained mentally and emotionally, but wondering if maybe everything hadn't been wrapped up just a bit too neatly - Claire saying her goodbyes and driving off into the great unknown could have been enough, but mixing in the montage of everyone meeting their eventual ends left me a little put-off, even while keeping with the continuity of the show's birth-to-death premise.

However, all that being said, it's strange enough for a TV show to make me laugh out loud, much less run an emotional rollercoaster for six months, err, five seasons. I'll miss this nutty family of morticians - those long weekends at the cabin just won't be the same without them to keep us company.

So, thanks, Mr. Ball: If only more television could be like this.",1148256000,5,4055,4.739007092198581
2499942,5,B000E6EK42,"Everyone's waiting to die, which is a simple fact of life.  Through it all, it's how much love you give and receive that really matters.  Then, when there is a lot of love given, the terror of death is softened and takes on the persona of a really good life.  Specifically, relative to this story, everyone's waiting to begin ""the first day of the rest of their lives.""  Nate's death galvanized the family and forced strength, unity, and love where it had not been before.

Some complained that the finale is maudlin.  I'm not sure if that word is apt to describe the event, although the episode made me feel like a ""person"" who hangs onto a soap opera for existence, and I was tense all through the final episode.

Unlike the typical episodes in previous seasons, the series finale was more sentimental than usual, but considering this is the finale, and there will be no more, it is appropriate that plots are not very well developed, and there is reliance on past issues:

 Ruth cried nearly every minute

 Brenda continued being tense and apprehensive

 Claire was cagey, vulnerable, optimistic, symbolic of youth

 David inched along positively, becoming more-and-more mature

 Keith was sage and . . . divine, very much the father figure.

However, the montage ending was well worth the wait in that it is satisfying, passionate, . . . as melodramatic as a full life should be, and unforgettable.  If only I can live and die so well.",1148256000,,1439,4.684
2499943,5,B000E6EK42,"Even as I write, tears continue to roll down my face.  Pathetic, perhaps... but how often does a series come along and effect so many people, so many different ways?

The series as a whole was brilliant.  Of course, there were some not so great episodes... but just like life, it can't always be candy and soda pop.  Heck... how many episodes of Friends sucked?  Enough said there me thinks!

I'm not going to spoil anything... but just like so many others have written... the strongest recommendation goes to anyone who is interested... START AT SEASON 1.  A failure to do so would be a great injustice to complexity in the characters, the plots, and the underlying message that you will inevitably come to find.

My wife and I were a bit dismayed by the first 5 episodes in Season 5.  They seemed to lack a certain something... but just like a thunderstorm, it takes several elements to come together before it actually rains.

- Last Episode:  (Everyone Is Waiting) - A lesson in life that has left me emotionally spent.  I, personally believe it is the best piece of TV that I have ever witnessed in my meer 38 years... well, next to the last episode of MASH.  That didn't suck either!

A Last Recommendation:  Start at the beginning... always try to watch with a loved one... look a little further than what you are seeing just on the TV, and experience a piece of art that will undoubtably leave you staring off into space, contemplating life, love, relationships, and what we all have in store for us... sooner or later.",1146787200,7,1527,4.5625
2499944,5,B000E6EK42,"That long quote I put in the title box comes from Maggie, George's daughter who plays an unexpectedly crucial role in this, final, season of SFU. On Nate's 40th birthday, Brenda gathers family and friends together at their home and throws a surprise party for him, which, despite her good intentions, quickly turns into a nightmarish experience not only to him and her but others as well. Surrounded by people he cannot connect with, Nate seeks an escape in the bedroom (was it his and Brenda's bedroom? I'll have to check), where Maggie is having her own hideout. The two strike up a conversation, and our Nate, just like the Nate we know, begins to, say, ""pour his heart out"": ""All I get out of my 40th birthday is that life is  f**king lonely."" To this, Maggie, in her overly calm, Quaker way, responds: ""If you think life is a vending machine, where you put in virtue and take out happiness, you're probably gonna get disappointed. I know that.""

We may take this as a Quaker's homespun wisdom or we may go overboard and compare it with what Socrates says in Republic, that justice (meaning, virtue) and knowledge *should* make us happy. We may even go further and how such Socratism, this unbridled optimism (if you will), is attacked by Nietzsche in his The Birth of Tragedy. Well, I may sound like I'm (trying to be) kidding, but I'm not. I have admired SFU intensely for many reasons, and one of them was that it often made me run to the bookshelf and earnestly open books whose existence I haven't really thought about for a long time. It's strange, come to think of it, that somehow great books, films, and shows all seem to find a way into each other. Somehow. Do they exist as a family, and come from the same origin?!

The end of SFU marked an end of an era of sort to me. Not having HBO subscrition until recently, I had to wait till early April this year for the DVD release to watch the final season. I now own all five seasons on DVD, and adding the final season to my collection, I felt as if, the world of SFU is now *complete* and on its own, and I'd have to let it live on its own. It is as if, through the fourth season, the Fisher family felt like a part of my own extended family, but now I feel more like a *visitor* to their world. Not all SFU fans would share this, weird, feeling. Well, I think it is actually a sense of loss, which comes from knowing that their world is indeed complete/completed now.",1146700800,7,2430,4.359823399558499

To say that it was the best final episode of any show I've ever seen is true, but also trite and stupid. It made me thoughtful, it made me sad, and it moved me in unexpected ways. I felt for the characters, to be sure, but also for the wisdom they imparted and the truths they revealed about all our lives - about my life - and how they must end someday. Happy or sad, troubled or easy, sudden or gradual, everything ends. It is a simple truth, never so eloquently expressed as we saw tonight.

The genius is beneath the surface, and Alan Ball and company have created a work of art that uses the mantle of death to portray what is so very special about being alive.  Humor and tragedy are brilliantly braided as a captivating cast of characters endeavors to make the most of their brief time on earth.

A more perfect series has never been created and a more perfect finale never devised. Make no mistake - this final bow packs a wallop. Long after the last frame glazes across the screen and long after your face has dried of its tears - you will be unable to shake the American tragedy that was the Fisher family.

We came to care about the characters and became invested in their lives.  We have learned lessons in caring and compassion, humanity and humility.  We have learned to bear the unbearable sadnesses in life with openness, well-placed anger and the knowledge that time inexorably moves on, always.

Alan Ball and his vision are uniquely honest and forthright, and one hopes his example is contagious in an industry grown afraid of its own shadow.

2499949,5,B000E6EK42,"For me there were two key moments that defined the dynamic of the fifth and final season of ""Six Feet Under"" for me.  The first was in ""Singing for Our Lives"" when Keith has once again sent Durrell to his room for going on a joy ride and Anthony explains his brother's philosophy of having all the fun you can while you can, because you are going to be sent back to the foster home.  The key moment is when Keith suddenly understands what is going on and for him everything changes with those two boys the rest of the way, even if David is slow to notice.  The second comes in the following episode, ""Ecotone,"" when Nate ends up in the hospital having emergency brain surgery when he is felled by AVM seizure after sleeping with Maggie.  There he is laid up in a hospital bed, his head swathed in bandages, having returned from death's door, and he tells his pregnant wife of nine episodes that their marriage is over.  Ten minutes later he ends up back on the other side of that door because at that point he deserved death more than he deserved happiness.  Two men make two choices, one is right and one is wrong.

The characters on ""Six Feet Under"" make a lot of significant choices that final season, although they are not always aware which one is more important.  David thinks the decision to adopt Durrell and Anthony is the important one, but it is facing the internal demons that terrify him that is more important.  Keith's decision to love Durrell no matter what is important, but it was set up by that moment in the office of the foster home where he did not bat an eye at the fact that Anthony had an older brother.  I must admit that I always cared about David and Keith more than I did about Nate and Brenda, so the way things played out did not upset me as much as they might have otherwise.  The big surprise with Nate and Brenda turns out to be that he was ultimately more self-destructive than she was, but still the basic irony that was except for their initial encoutner in that closet at the airport, these two were never really on the same page ever again.  That is why the nadir of the season for me was not Nate's death, but his final confrontation with Brenda and it was not until Brenda's dream in which Nathaniel introduces himself, noting that they have never met, that the nightmare of his final act finally ends.  But then Nate's death and the grief it brings is what allows each of the Fishers to move on.

Clearly people come apart so that they can be put back together in these twelve episodes.  It is Frederico's bitter declaration to Vanessa that he knows his affair has cost him everything, that makes it possible for them to go on.  As Vanessa tells him, they cannot go back and indeed they do not.  He cannot forgive himself for having destroyed his family and she cannot forgive herself for still loving him, and that provides the common ground they need to go on.  The reconciliation that I cannot really explain is Ruth and George.  Not because George does not deserve to come back into her life given the support he gives Ruth in the wake of Nate's death, but because there is no real rhyme or reason to George's transformation beyond the idea it provides a grace note.  At least the stability that Billy shows over the final episodes can be readily attributed to drugs.  But Ruth's relationship to George is a minor concern as she copes with the death of her first born and the painful sight of her depositing a shovel of dirt on Nate's body in his grave.

In the end the show comes to Claire, not just because she belts out that infamous ode to panty hose, ""You Ride Up My Thigh,"" but more because she is the one who drives off into the future at the end.  Of course it is Claire.  She has the most talent, but she also has the most future and there is a sense in which what is ultimately important in the end is not love, but time.  Claire might not deserve to live a hundred years when others do not, but it is certainly a sweet deal if you can get it.  Besides, I think of her as Ruth's surrogate and that she is heading down that open highway not for herself, but for the rest of her fatally flawed family.  ""Everyone's Waiting"" was a brilliant final episode that redeemed the faults and failures of the final season.  Of course Alan Ball had to show us the deaths of the entire cast and fade to white to tell us when they died.  I lost count as to how many times I had to listen to Sia Furler's ""Breathe Me"" before the end sequence of the haunting series finale ""Everything Ends"" was exorcised from my mind, but it took at least a week.  Fortunately I had the CD so that I could at least get away from rewatching the episode's end over and over again.  Still, those words become the benediction for ""Six Feet Under"":

Be my friend
Hold me, wrap me up

I'm needy

I think the other f-word outnumbers ""fun"" by a factor of 100 to 1 on this show.  These stories present a conception of modern American life that must be foreign to most people.  The elements of human life (work, love, creation) that promise happiness and fulfillment are absent in these characters' existence.  Their lives are shallow, aimless and empty as a result.  I'm not sure that the series creators intended this syllogism, as it confirms the importance of traditional values.",1144108800,6,599,4.891089108910891
2499951,5,B000E6EK42,"6FU was not a show about death, it was how people dealt with the hardship of the rut that life can give to you. The only time when people look and face their lives was when someone died. For the Fisher family, who spent their existence around death, their realizations as to what to do with their lives, bad and good choices, came much slower to others.

My breakdown of the characters:

Nate: Brenda summed him up pretty well at how convincing he was when all he wanted in life was for someone to make him feel and seem like a better person

David and Keith: I felt their relationship all through the show was forced and labored. It wasn't until this last season, when all their silly drama stopped, that I could take a look at them as a couple and see what we should have seen all along.

Brenda: actually had the most growth out of all the characters. I felt she rounded out nicely considering her strange past with relationships. Mother hood will do that to you.

Ruth: She had some of the best lines out of all the characters, period. ""Maybe it was an unfortunate lotion."" HAHAHHA People like her are  so boxed up that it is nearly impossible to free them. I hope she found happiness.

Clare: She was my least favorite. Being an artist myself, and seeing the very distorted and completely inaccurate view of artists in the series, I just couldn't relate to her. She was so selfish, granted her age allowed for that, but I felt no pity for her at all. I get it, she had her whole life ahead of her, we are suppose to identify with that, but she was just annoying.

Rico: I thought he was cool, and had the most conflict. A young man gifted at what he does, but with no real clout in the business until he is able to fight for what he wants and gain respect. I wish they hadn't taken the usual sexual detour with him as they did with ALL THE CHARACTERS, but hey, that seems to be what people want.

The show summed up in one of the most brilliant ways I have ever seen. Looking into the future, reflecting into the past, and realizing that these five years were just that. It was a fraction of time, be it the time we were to follow, but life goes on. Not just for the Fishers but all of us.",1143936000,16,2194,4.217183770883055

The first featurette is in two parts, both lasting 30 min a piece and takes a look at SFU's many elements with interviews with cast and crew members.  The second deals with the impact of the show with many interesting interviews with real life funeral home directors.  After viewing the featurettes, I felt like watching the whole season again.  As always the comentaries were both informative and intriguing.  The packaging was also very appealing and matched well with the other boxsets.

New viewers:  Watch season one first.  If you don't enjoy the pilot, odds are you will not enjoy the series at all.  If you enjoyed the feature film American Beauty you will probably love Six Feet Under.  The creator Alan Ball also wrote American Beauty and both share similar styles and themes.  SFU is a dark comedy with very dramatic elements, and while many have tackled this mix of genres before, no one has ever done it with such profound humanity and beauty.  Nothing on television, before or after, has yet to match the intimacy and brilliance of SFU.

Casual Viewers:  As far as the overall season, it is probably not the best in comparision to some of the earlier seasons.  But more than anything, the fifth season brings an intense and enlightening closure to a series that has impacted the way we look at a television show.  The last several episodes are among the best of the long running series as they deal with a very personal and deep tragic event.  Even if you didn't enjoy a particular season, the final season is a great way to look at the series as a whole.

Fans of the show:  Many fans probably wish that SFU was still alive and running, but none will dispute that the closing of the incredible series was more complete and fulfilling than anyone could have hoped.  The execution to the final episodes deserves the greatest admiration to all the people involved.  But as in life itself, the show eventually must end.  And in closing of the series, it makes SFU that much more important and something that should influence the way we look at our own lives forever.",1143590400,25,2508,4.694954128440367
2499956,5,B000E6EK42,"I'm almost in a state of mourning over the loss of this show.  I agree with many other critics below, season 4 was not that good, and at times almost seemed like it was a different show from seasons 1,2,3,& 5. Season 5 more than makes up for what was lacking in Season 4.  And I'm happy to report, the final episode (which I've probably seen 3 or 4 times now)was one of the best written, best produced, best directed, and best acted shows in the history of television.  You will not be disappointed. (and if you're looking for something to fill the void, check out ""Huff"" on Showtime)",1143072000,15,584,4.339449541284404
2499957,3,B000E6EK42,"Especially the review by ""Barbara Bab"".  I'm so mad that she actually gave away the ending!!!  How mean is that!!",1142812800,12,113,4.6
2499958,5,B000E6EK42,"WOW. I just finished watching the final episode of the final season and, although some people think it was a bit rushed, I thought it ended spectacularly (especially, as most SFU fans already know, the last 10 minutes).

The best episode in this season however is no. 10 - All Alone. After an important event in the previous episode, the glorious attention to detail and meticulous crafting exceeds all expectations. By the end of this episode I was just balling.

It is unlikely that any other show will ever come close to the high level of emotional and intellectual artistry that this series aimed for throughout its 5 season run. It will indeed be sorely missed.",1142640000,24,666,4.732758620689655
2499959,2,B000E6EK42,"Did any of the people reviewing the final season actually see the 4th season of the show?  Did they have to suffer through that crap like me and countless other devoted fans who were there from the beginning when the show was actually good?  Apparently not because if they were I don't understand how their enthusiasm for the show wasn't at a low ebb just like mine.  I honestly tried to get back into the show and the 5th season was certainly better than the previous, but not by much.  And not enough to make me care any more.  I'm amazed at how many people were profoundly affected by the finale.  If I cared at all about the show & its characters at that point, maybe just maybe I might have shed a tear....hell even been moved without shedding a tear.  But somewhere along the way from the brilliant first season to the pretty awesome 2nd season and the good but deteriorating 3rd season up to the atrocious season 4, the creators & cast of Six Feet Under lost me and I was never able to regain my enthusiasm.  I have the first 2 seasons at home on dvd and may possibly purchase the 3rd if I find it on sale somewhere, but that's it.  If I ever get a craving for some quality SFU episodes I'll pull out my discs from seasons 1 & 2, possibly 3.  But I honestly couldn't go any further.  A shame that what was once such a fine program, in one season, deteriorated before my very eyes.  So I'll give this season a 2 rating simply because it was a slight improvement over season 4 which was definitely a 1.",1142467200,9,1507,4.230769230769231
2499960,5,B000E6EK42,"The last season is so surprising and heartbreaking. I can't help but feel like the characters are real, and I end up grieving and crying for them after I watch the last episode. I had grown to love and know these people, and to watch all of their endings was hard. Yet fulfilling since we do learn how their lives continue and then finally end. But my only problem with the last show was how Keith was gunned down, and how Brenda was left alone with her crazy-ass brother.",1142294400,6,472,4.314606741573034
2499961,5,B000E6EK42,"I LOVE this show, Period. I'm sad to see it go. One of the best series I have EVER watched!",1142035200,8,91,3.6
2499962,5,B000E6EK42,"The last episode of this season/series is one of the best I've ever seen. Certainly as far as series finales are concerned, it has to rank in the top two.

I cried for the last fifteen minutes. The montage of everyone's death has been mentioned in a ton of other reviews...All I can add to that is that despite myself, and despite the cheesy, poorly executed make-up, wardrobes, sets, and at times acting during this sequence it still hit a strong, strong emotional chord with me. At first I was annoyed with myself. Then, I played it again and cried some more.

This is a ""Nate"" season, and to me he was always one of the most relatable characters in the series. The fact that he leaves things in the state of a train wreck is apropo...how tired are all we of everything being handed to us in a neat little package? His family deals with it, and we get to see how, which is the most interesting part imo.

To me, the *most* compelling character in this last season (and of the entire series) is definitely Ruth. She gets all the emotional powerhouse scenes in the last three episodes and rightly so. I cried with her from episodes 61 - 63...and I think that no matter how you evaluate the season as a whole, the last three episodes make this DVD set worth it. Get it somehow!",1142035200,9,1276,4.352941176470588

If you did not watch this show when it aired, I recommend you do not buy or watch the show now.  You missed being a part of an experience so rewarding, so moving, so enriching, so . . . six feet under, that you will never forgive yourself for the mistake.  Sometimes I'm overcome by a sadness identical to grief when I think too much about the show and how it's gone.  Its characters appear in my dreams all the time.  Sometimes I wish SFU had never been at all.",1141862400,7,487,4.172043010752688
8106489,2,B000E6EK42,"Seasons 1-2 get a full 5 stars. They're sad, funny, and clever.
Season 3 gets a -5 stars, the ""Lisa Season."" The ""Joe Lies, Joe Lies, When He Cries"" actress from Say Anything. REALLY, no one cares about this character.
Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind?) So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?

Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?

If you have NOTHING else to do, watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good, and then move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just slow and depressing. And the abrupt unoriginal lazy ending is an insult, both to the characters and the viewer.",1519084800,,2690,4.7106382978723405
