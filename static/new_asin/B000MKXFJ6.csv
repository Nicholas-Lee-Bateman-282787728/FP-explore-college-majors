8169724,5,B000MKXFJ6,"If your kids speak spanish or your wish they can improve it, this is an amazing and fun tool. No 'spanglish' or 'tex-mex', 100% correct spanish language.",1265932800,2,153,4.703703703703703
8169725,5,B000MKXFJ6,Spanish is sooo much easier to learn for children when there's entertainment included. The language and intonations will expose the children to another voice than the teacher's or the Spanish news channel. All for stimulation and education.,1260316800,,240,5.513513513513513
8169726,3,B000MKXFJ6,"The DVD isn't bad, but it's a little 'cheap' and pretty repetitive. Don't get me wrong, the colors are nice and my daughter speaks Spanish so the educational value is good. The South American accents are annoying though to be honest (granted I am Puerto Rican). I wouldn't buy it again, but my 3 year old daughter doesn't mind it.",1200873600,,330,4.516666666666667
8169727,3,B000MKXFJ6,I own several DVD's in the collection; I found this specific title really unimpressive.  It's OK; I thought that they could've made it better.,1198022400,2,142,4.916666666666667
8169728,5,B000MKXFJ6,"I bought this DVD for my 1 year old son. I am very selective in what I will let him watch, and only allow him to watch TV occasionally. This is a good selection for it's educational value. I like that it exposes him to Spanish, and he likes it because it is colorful and lively.",1188172800,,278,3.982142857142857
