2174028,1,B00067HP78,"So I fell in love with the excercises and mellow workouts on the Cindy Crawford video with Kathy Kaehler.  I've been using it for a year and finally felt like I was ready to move on.  I thought that the success of the Cindy video was due to Kathy but apparently that isn't so.

This video has horrible music, pretty much the same excercises as the Cindy workout and oh yeah...have you seen Kathy's arms?  There bigger than The Rock's.  She's jacked...no thanks.  So disapointed.  I guess I'll stick with Cindy and the non-annoying Kathy.  What's odd is she never had an accent in the other workout...maybe it came with the giant arms. :-(  I guess the workout is alright if you can stand to look at her and put it on mute.  There has to be something better out there than this!",1109980800,2,777,4.370629370629371
2174029,4,B00067HP78,"I do it quietly in the morning on mute reading the subtitles while my toddler is still sleeping. The best thing about it is there's not alot of bouncing and yet I'm sweating so I think it's good. The down side, there's only 5 minutes of a cardio blast for the entire 35 mintues in the beginning, I don't know if i'll see results from so little cardio for weight loss. I've been doing it a week and have not seen weight loss results but my limbs feel tighter. go Kathy!",1106784000,7,468,4.153846153846154
2174030,1,B00067HP78,"I workout everyday for about a half hour somedays cardio some days just legs and abs.  I am in fit but not disgustingly.  I felt that the workout started off good but was boring and she talks to you like your a child when she explains stuff.  I hated this and am very angry I spent the money because I will probably never do it again!!

Even though she is annoying (you can put you on mute) Denise Austin tapes are great!!!",1106092800,2,423,4.121951219512195
2174031,5,B00067HP78,"I really loved this workout! Kathy works out all your muscles with simple yet effective moves. I really love that this video is only 35 mins long which is great for me because I have two toddlers which don't give me much time to myself.  Despite reading somewhat negative reviews on this video, I must say that I am really glad I bought this and definitely will use it regularly. The exercises are low impact and the moves are simple and easy to follow.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick and thorough workout or to someone new to workout videos...they will love it, I know I do!",1105228800,22,612,4.359649122807017
2174042,3,B00067HP78,"Even though I think this one is slightly better than the Workout Class DVD, it's still nothing to recommend. It is chaptered into 5-minute segments which is a good feature (like warmup - cardio blast - bottoms - arms - legs - abs - stretch) for a total of 35 minutes. The exercises are not long enough to be challenging and I used ankle weights and heavy dumbbells, but I've seen worse DVDs. I also have to agree with another reviewer who said Kathy seemed somewhat heavy with a pretty thick middle and huge arms.",1221177600,,513,4.410526315789474
2174043,5,B00067HP78,"I love, love, love this workout so much I'm purchasing it again after loosing it in a recent move.  I've been lost without this simple and very effective routine.  I lost 10 pounds by faithfully using this DVD and feel this is the easiest and most motivating workout I have ever encountered!!",1200096000,6,292,4.596153846153846
2174044,5,B00067HP78,"I have tried several work out videos, including Cindy Crawford.  This video by Kathy Kaehler is the best video I've tried.  It seems effortless and easy yet is very powerful and effective.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to pick up their energy level, get more flexible, and toned.  This is not a very demanding tape, it is not for workout 'experts' but it is fun, relaxing, music is good, and it is not difficult to the point where you don't want to keep working out.  I never have problems keeping up my routine because I see and feel the results and that keeps me motivated.  Kathy is very pleasant, nice, and a 'real person' not some made up Barbie doll, and it feels like you are working out with a friend.  I would sincerely recommend this video to anyone.",1198540800,4,772,4.394366197183099
2174045,2,B00067HP78,"I too, was disappointed in this video. The excercies are mundane and I feel bad saying this, but I have hard time looking at her. She has more of a masculine body and actually does not look like she is in shape. Personally if I am going to follow an instructor I would like them to look better than I do. I have recently purchased several  DVD workout videos from a variety of instructors that I really like alot. I know I will never play this one unless it is absolutely necessary.",1194393600,,482,4.239130434782608
2174046,4,B00067HP78,"This DVD is a great conditioning workout.  Many previous reviews criticize the short cardio aspect, but the streangth/conditioning aspect of the video is wonderful.  It truly works every muscle and is very challenging.  I would highly reccomend using this every other day in conjunction with a different high impact cardio DVD.",1186876800,7,327,5.372549019607843
2174047,4,B00067HP78,"I like Kathy Kaehler's very basic instructions.  She gives you some information on proper form, but if you've ever done any aerobics moves before then you probably don't need more info than she gives.  I like that the video is broken down into 5 minute segments, but, like other reviewers have mentioned, 5 minutes of cardio seems short.  If you do all the segments in sequence then you are probably getting a decent beginner cardio workout.  I think I'll do this video every other day for the toning aspects of it, but then I'll walk/jog on my treadmill on the off days.  Unless you are very much a beginner, I can't see this DVD being enough exercise to lose weight (but I'm no fitness expert, so I could be wrong!).

The best thing about this DVD:  It was only $2.50 at Target AND it came with her other DVD: Workout Class (which I haven't tried yet)!
The worst thing about this DVD:  Kathy Kaehler's body is completely un-inspirational to me.  I guess I prefer to look at my instructor's body and aspire to have a similar one.  I know, of course, that everyone's body type is different and these moves are so basic I know that they won't cause me to suddenly have a manly-looking body, but it is still on the back of mind the entire time I do the workout.",1171152000,2,1259,4.387931034482759
2174048,3,B00067HP78,"But this tape was mediocre at best. The cardio blast segment didn't make me sweat much - more like a warm up. The constant moving a chair, putting it to the side, bringing it back, getting something else - I felt it took away from the actual workout. It could have been organized better, like doing all the chair exercises then moving to the mat rather than switching it all the time.

Also, that weird violin music during the cool down segment was a turn off. It's more irritating than soothing.

I am by no means an expert - I consider myself a beginner. But I highly recommend Claudia Schiffer & Kathy Kaehler's ""Perfectly Fit"" VHS tapes. They are 30 minute workouts that target specific areas and they are highly effective. You will sweat and see results!",1140652800,7,759,4.532846715328467
2174049,4,B00067HP78,"I think this is a great ""basics"" workout video.  The segments are 5 minutes each and hit all of the trouble spots....arms, legs, abs, butt and cardio.  They are simple and can be done in your own home with the only need being a couple of weights.  I first saw and taped a week long 5 minute series of exercises by Kathy Kaehler featured on the Today show, which I used religiously until my husband accidently taped over it.  This tape is very much in line with that series.

I would recommend it for anyone looking for an all around basic workout.  It really works for me.",1140480000,2,572,4.299065420560748
2174050,1,B00067HP78,"Kathy talks down to you while explaining her moves, she is a terrible instructor who obviously is on video becasue she trains some hollywood types, this was a waste of money",1130371200,2,173,4.612903225806452
2174051,5,B00067HP78,"I've never taken any aerobics classes before, so this DVD is a perfect introduction.  I get the feeling that anyone who's taken any aerobics at all will be disappointed with this DVD, but after all it IS called ""Basics"".  I used to run on the treadmill or ride the stationary bike then train on weight machines.  Then I got sidetracked for a few years because of constant overseas travel for work.  The places I went usually didn't have workout facilities and I was usually too tired anyway (jet lag is NOT good for the system). I really got out of shape and put on some significant weight.  I'm done with the travel now, but when I recently tried to get back into my old routine, I tried to do everything at the same level as before, and wound up injuring muscles and feeling crummy because of over-exertion.  A friend of mine suggested this video, and I tried it even though I was skeptical. I thought aerobic workout videos were all about pushing hard and killing yourself for a celebrity-perfect body.  This video isn't like that at all.  It's low-key and definitely user-friendly. I think that Kathy Kaehler has a pleasant personality, motivational but not pushy or annoying.  The low-key tone is a little deceptive, though--the first time I did the entire 35-minute workout, I thought it was too easy--then I suffered from sore muscles the next day.  Now I do the entire workout each day and I'm adding some running and extra weights.  Maybe I'll even seek out a live aerobics class!  This video was definitely a help in getting me back on track.",1129939200,8,1552,4.624087591240876
2174062,5,B00067HP78,"I really enjoy this workout and feel it adds good variety to my routine to keep me motivated.  You can go through the whole thing in 35 minutes and feel like you hit every part of your body.  This is great for days when you're in a hurry.  Also, it feels more like 15 minutes for some reason.  The time really flies during this one, in my opinion, but you still feel the muscles working.",1126051200,3,387,4.12
2174063,2,B00067HP78,"I really enjoyed the part I was able to do which was around 30 minutes of the DVD, then as soon as the last part of the program begins, the DVD freezes. I have never been able to go further. The DVD was defective. I was disappointed in getting it in that condition.",1124064000,,265,4.018867924528302
2174064,4,B00067HP78,"I really enjoyed the ease of this workout with Kathy Kaehler.  I have never tried a video of hers before.  It definitely is the basics because I knew most of the exercises.  I found it a little lacking in the aerobic portion.  I don't think any ""total"" fitness workout can only have five minutes of aerobic exercise, and then 30 minutes of strength training.  Also, I am doubtful of how much benefit you would receive of only doing five minutes here and there.  I really like Kathy, the exercises were easy to do, and I do feel I will benefit from them.  But I wish the aerobic exercise was extended.  I almost feel I need to do the video twice to get a real workout.",1123804800,2,667,4.28
2174065,5,B00067HP78,"This is the perfect excersize program for the beginner. I watched the entire video prior to actually working it so I could get a feel of what was to come. Then, I worked it AND felt it! It is simple to follow. The 5-minute segments for each target area is perfect. You may choose to do some or all. Hit the pause and increase the reps. The presentation is friendly and non-condescending. The down side is you have to play through the intro each time the DVD is started (cannot fast-forward through it). I use this time to get my excersize area ready. If you are thinking of starting a program, this is it!",1122940800,2,605,4.315789473684211
2174066,5,B00067HP78,"Kathy Kaehler is a celebrity trainer who knows how to tone and condition your entire body in about 50 minutes (DVD says approx 45 minutes). She is a more serious instructor who still likes to have fun.

If you have an hour to exercise this is a good choice. She does give ideas for working out for 5 minutes a day, but I can't see this workout being effective in only 5 minutes. I'm learning you need to workout a lot more than 5 minutes a day if you want a fit body like Kathy Kaehler. Let's be realistic here. I hear that some very famous individuals, who we all know, exercise 6 times a week and for way more than 5 minutes. I've even heard of some actors trying to get in shape by working out for 2 hours a day.

Each segment doesn't have its own warm-up section, so you will more than likely end up doing at least two segments at a time, maybe the first two sections and the bonus at the end would be easy to fit into a tight schedule.

After you do this workout you will want to do the entire workout again and again. It is slightly addictive for reasons I can't quite comprehend. The set is in a living room; so maybe this makes me feel ""at home."" The set includes a Persian carpet, sapphire curtain, couch and table. A chair is taken from the dining room and you will need a sturdy chair. I prefer to put the chair up against a wall.

You honestly don't have time to be running about collecting the items you need. Things to collect before you start: mat, towel, chair, ball, 5-lb weights. The playing cards are optional but maybe more motivational than essential. Kathy Kaehler uses the cards while doing lunges and once while doing abs. Otherwise, you really don't need special equipment. The yoga mat seems essential when doing some yoga exercises.

Segments:

Warm it up
Cardio Blast
Bottoms Up
Arm Sculpting
Hot Legs
Ab-Solutely Ab
Stretch it out

Where do I feel the workout the most? In my stomach and legs. Who knew leaning up against a wall could be so intense or that my abs could feel so tight in such a short amount of time.

 The motivational music keeps you focused and you quickly burn lots of calories, increase muscle mass and reduce your risk of disease.

Just when you think you are ""absolutely"" finished and all stretched out, the bonus section gets you all worked up again. I think the bonus section should be part of the workout and put back in right before the stretching. Although, if you want a break after doing your abs it can work pretty well.

Health tips include things like ""not crossing your legs while sitting"" and ""walking when angry."" The Nutrition tips help you work on your lifestyle and include ideas like drinking vegetable juices as snacks.

Benefits:

Increased Cardiovascular strength
Calories - you will burn a lot if you do the entire workout at once
Increase Muscle Mass - the use of weights helps
Increase Flexibility - not much stretching, but enough to stretch you out after exercising

I look forward to trying more Kathy Kaehler workouts. She works me out fast and furiously and I'm still sort of panting while writing this. This workout should make you sweat and give you a burst of energy. Nice as an afternoon pick up to wake you up for an evening out.

2174067,5,B00067HP78,"I'm really glad I bought this workout dvd. It's one I've been able to stick to and I always look forward to doing the workouts. I like how you can break it up into small targeted workouts although I usually find myself doing the entire 35 minutes once I get started. I like Kathy Kaehler who comes across as warm yet very professional and motivating. I like that she looks fit rather than supermodel-y and silly as it sounds, I like the 'Friends' type set she uses. I'm a very visual person and little things like that can help me stay motivated! I did this workout 4 times a week along with power walking and a sensible low carb/calorie diet using some of the tips she gives on the dvd. I dropped 2 sizes in less than 3 weeks and love that I can fit into skinny jeans again! Definitely one of my favorites. Like having your own personal Hollywood trainer in your own home.",1117670400,15,873,4.296969696969697
2174068,5,B00067HP78,It is a great time saving workout that really makes a difference in your tone. I had been doing the one that she did with Cindy Crawford and like it. I like this one even better. It is organized great and has excellent instructions from Kathy. I do this in combination with walking 3 to 4 days a week and have seen a real difference in my body. Keep up the good work Kathy.,1115510400,5,373,4.054054054054054
2174069,4,B00067HP78,"I bought Kathy Kaehler's Total Fitness Workout so I could get a good workout at home. I love that it's broken into segments so you can choose which areas to work on. I work out when I get home from the office. On those days I end up working really late, I tell myself I'll just do the warm-up and cardio segments, but I always end up doing the entire 35-minute routine. Kathy's personality and the cool music make the time fly by! Kathy encourages without sounding fake. Usually I get annoyed by an instructor or bored with a workout tape after the first few weeks. I've owned the Total Fitness Workout for a couple months and still enjoy it immensely. My only complaint is that there's not a longer cardio option for those days I really need to work off those calories!",1114992000,3,770,4.391608391608392
2174070,4,B00067HP78,"The ""Kathy Kaehler Basics Total Fitness Workout"" DVD is perfect for anyone ONLY looking for a light moderate workout in 35 minutes or less that produces results.  My case:  returning to an exercise regime post major surgery resulting in a 9 lbs reduction in two weeks.  The DVD consists of seven 5 minute workout segments (Warm up, Cardio, Glutes, Arms, Legs, Abs and Stretching).  You may choose to play the entire workout or to select a segment(s).  The only equipment you will need is a mat/towel, a small flexible ball, a chair and 3/5 lbs dumbbells.  Bonus material is also included incorporating 3 mini fitness breaks, health tips and previews of ""Kathy Kaehler's Workout Class"" DVD and ""Celebrity Workouts"" book.

So, I often turn to my DVD workout collection for help to keep on track of working out. This video is 35 minutes and includes a great warm out, toning for all body parts, and stretching/cool down.  It left me wanting more. I hope Kathy builds on this winner soon.  This is a must have if you like body sculpting type exercises and are craving a DVD that will give you a good overall workout in a short period of time!  Love it!!",1110931200,6,586,3.899159663865546

So I thought I should try Kathy Kaehler as the Perfectly Fit was designed by her. I really like this workout because it's easy to follow, it covers the whole body including cardio but doesn't make me feel too tired afterward. I understand for some people who have been working out a lot might feel this is not enough, but for people like me, who haven't worked out for years, I think this is a great workout routine to start working out again with.",1496016000,,633,4.239669421487603

The beauty of this work-out, is that as you get to know the routines better and better, you can increase the reps while Kathy is explaining to the beginner the mechanics of the movement.  For instance, I can easily get in 25 hip lifts, because I have already started doing them while she is introducing to the beginner.  I know each segment so well, that I can take this work-out anywhere I go, even if I've left the dvd at home.  It's composed of seven 5-minute segments for a total of 35 minutes; it targets arms/upper body, legs, abs, lower body (glutes, thighs, hips) and has warm-up, cardio, and final stretch segments.
