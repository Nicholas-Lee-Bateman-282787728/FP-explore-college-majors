4177792,2,B003R4ZMS6,"The pilot episode of Showtime's ""The Big C"" as available on Amazon Video on Demand is censored.  Curse words are silenced -- at first I thought my audio was dropping out, as this program has a lot of profanity.  Who knows what else has been cut from the original broadcast version?

Why offer a version of the program that completely undermines its artistic integrity?  I will, with 100% certainty, not be buying subsequent episodes via Amazon VOD... so glad they offered this free preview.

As to the content of the show, it seemed rather ho-hum (although I love Laura Linney, who deserves a better vehicle).  But who can really tell without seeing the real deal?",1282348800,8,664,4.730434782608696
4177793,4,B003R4ZMS6,"THE BIG C started this week as a Showtime series for television opposite the controversial WEEDS in the late evening, subjects for mature audiences time slot.  Most viewers will have mixed feelings about this first episode, so loaded with new characters with whom we have little time to understand, all edgy, and yet all surrounded by the unifying theme of how one woman deals with being told she has Stage 4 Malignant Melanoma but who decides to not inform anyone of her diagnosis, instead going after the outrageous way of living that has always been foreign to her obsessive/compulsive teacher personality.

There are few actresses who could pull this off: Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses on the screen today, is the perfect choice for making this unbelievable character credible AND charismatic.  As Cathy Jamison, she is married to a bumbling irresponsible joker Paul (Oliver Platt, again an actor in the top echelon) who is currently out of the house over some disagreement with Cathy, and is mother to naughty boy Adam (Gabriel Basso), lives across the street from a elderly curmudgeon Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) with whom Cathy finally agrees to accept and to like, is a sister to a freaky psycho brother Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), is attended by her diagnosing just-fresh-out-of-residency naive physician Dr Todd (Reid Scott), and carries on teaching a classroom with bored students, including one sassy, arrogant and overweight Andrea (Gabourey Sidibe).  Life is full of surprises and they pop by so quickly that we barely can tell where the series is going.  As for this viewer, though not impressed with the structure of the show, staying around for the pleasure of watching Linney and Platt will be worth it - hopefully!

It pulls you into the series, as is intended, but also can stand alone as a wonderful half hour of television, with characters you know and care about by the end of the half hour.  And that's not to mention the ability to elicit laughter and perhaps a tear or two during that same short time.  I absolutely love it.",1436745600,,419,4.148148148148148

  I watch all genres and I am picky..I only review when I passionately love something and this is one of those shows you are excited to tell others about.. finding and watching this is like finding treasure... you cant help but tell everyone what a gem it is. Originally I had no desire to watch this ..the description cast and cover art didn't appeal to me at all. I was hooked on a dif show with my bf but I was trying not to watch it with out him lol. I had that bummed feeling like the show I wanted to see just couldn't be replaced . I was on demand looking for something new and unlike the rest , I wanted a paid show because I had 3 months free premium channels, That is when I finally watched The big C. I didn't have high hopes for this one bc it sounded like a depressing plot and I didn't recognize the actors etc, but I was bored, desperate for a new type of show. I watched this show a on a whim and 7 hours later I'm hooked ..out of my mind addicted and in love .. I was re watching episodes with everyone I could, Shazaming the ost songs, Googling and IMDB researching- the producer ,director, writer ,creative staff, all the actors names,  searching to find any and all other films they are each involved in, rating it everywhere I see it... referring to characters using full names and quoting them.. pinterest boarding ..social media sharing it, watching ost music video , searching for deleted scenes and bonus clips on showtime.com ..OBVIOUSLY ... . I was officially a die hard Fan... I have only reacted to a few other TV shows this way.. DEXTER, BREAKING BAD, Orange is the New Black,  . I love everything about this show and it is perfect for everyone . This show is right there with Breaking Bad and Dexter in my opinion and in the opinion of all of the people I have turned on to it.

  ---PROS---
(incomplete list as it is endless)

-  Feel good funny in a clever and natural way
-  The On-set Chemistry is as good as it gets with this cast, Every character relationship has a unique, powerful and completely different type chemistry adding depth and versatility to the personality and story of every cast member.
- Amazing Soundtrack
- Dark humor
- Unpredictable plot twists
- Moments that will make you cry like a baby
-  every situation changes and every character goes through phases with their role constantly evolving
- Has a sort of undefinable magic ..
- makes you think about life in a million and one different perspectives
- had the potential to be a ""typical roller coaster of emotion"" but instead it was more like ""a car ride of emotion"" with a mostly consistent pace, moving sometimes fast and sometimes slow, with different drivers taking control and different passengers along for the ride, wrong turns and right ones, choices being made that take you different destinations, changes of scenery, breakdowns, crashes happen with warning..
- genuinely funny, realistic, dysfunctional, emotional, offering surprising plot twists, tense cliff hangers, multiple perspectives and
-the subtle transitions of emotional tone and
-The collaborative genius and shared vision is undeniable here.

---CONS---
- ONLY 3 SEASONS and one FINALE MINI-season then it ENDS!!
- IT ENDS!!
- YOU MISS IT!! lol
- IT ISN'T ON PRIME
- IT ISN't on NETFLIX
- you have to pay for showtime.
_ IT ENDS!!!",1423958400,,3337,4.561872909698996

I have tried to lend it to several friends and family members who don't want to watch it as they think it will be too depressing...grrr!!!... they are missing so much. All characters are standouts and the subject of cancer is handled with realism, sensitivity and appropriate humour. The writing is so clever- making us think, care and also confront the realities of the human condition...I've watched all seasons and it never falters in its quality and treatment of all the characters whatever their struggles.",1398038400,,574,4.86734693877551

She and Oliver Platt have a nice rapport, but John Benjamin Hickey, as the heroine's crazy brother, really steals the show.

She was going through the motions before her diagnosis, concentrating on her husband and son.

Laura Linney is outstanding in this series and it's very difficult not to fall in love with her after watching it, I couldn't imagine any other actor playing the role as brilliantly as she does. The writing is so sharp, witty and clever, it can make you laugh out loud one minute then cry out loud the next, and I love that every episode in the first season comes full circle. It was about time somebody came with the idea to write a show like this, I believe so many people can benefit from the story and let's hope this causes a lot more awareness and most importantly a cure for this horrible disease.",1369699200,,686,4.244274809160306

She did not, but said that several patrons had requested it and told her it was ""wonderful"". Given that endorsement, I decided to give it a try and checked it out.

I only made it through three episodes before taking it back to the library. I kept hoping it would get better; but quite frankly, just watching those three episodes made me seriously wish I could give my brain a shower. This show is very dirty and unpleasant with a lot of immorality (ie, adultery, gay marriage, and the like), some nudity, and very frequent F-bombs. All the characters are pretty awful and unpleasant and elicit absolutely no sympathy. It seemed that the cancer diagnosis and main characters' methods of coping with that were all secondary to the trashy behavior and profanity, so there wasn't one thing uplifting or positive about the whole show. I didn't realize until reading the other reviews on Amazon that this thing airs on Showtime, which admittedly has a much lower moral standard in general.

Both of them usually make excellent choices, and are in films that are very entertaining, or thought provoking, or ideally, both.  Both actors here do a wonderful job, as always.  But, what the writers think is 'real', is not how the majority of people experience what is 'real'.  Cancer is a scary, life altering diagnosis.  But, having it make you a very selfish person?  No.  And the crazy idea that your spouse means nothing, can be cast aside?  No. How about the idea that kids are 'adults' in their teen, or even tween, years!  No.  Most of the writing does not ring true.  And, saying, 'Hey, lets show cancer in a new way, a way most people would not behave.', that just makes the writers seem sadly out of touch with the real world, not edgy.  Or else, it makes one very sad for the world they occupy.

4177959,4,B003R4ZMS6,"I was skeptical about this series, as I don't get Showtime, so  I was unfamiliar with the show and it's downbeat premise.
A woman approaching middle age is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and tune in each week for meriment and hijinks.
However, I was won over by Laura Linney's bold performance. Similar to ""Breaking Bad"", we follow our protagonist who learns to live only when they learn that they are about to die, except without the meth. In both shows, the lead discovers what they are capable of, and learns to overcome their fears. It's a chance to examine what is important in your life, and what is just an illusion.
 I like this show, but sometimes I find the characters a little too precious, a little too staged. I doubt that having a brother who lives out of dumpsters would be a source of bemusement in real life.  Still, I enjoyed the first season and will watch season two when available.
As far as renting the episodes from Amazon, it all worked technically, but they have to lower the price for a half hour show.  Charging the same as a full length movie left me feeling gouged.",1330646400,,1095,4.515151515151516

4177984,3,B003R4ZMS6,"My similarities to ""Kathy"", the show's main character: I have stage iv cancer, a teenage son and work in a school. The only realistic portrayal in this show is when the teenage son wants to spend all his time with friends, texting his girlfriend and continuously asks for money.  Oh, and also the neighbor, Marlene, is somewhat believable. They were stupid for getting rid of her. I loved the way she looked and dressed, she was a cute character.

I've never been a fan of Laura Linney.  In the Big C, as Kathy, she displays many stereotypical traits of a certain kind of TV mom.  The most glaring of these traits is her quest to find fulfillment by having flirtations and/or sex with men she's just recently met.  To think that numerous men find this 40 year old woman that sexy is shear fantasy. And why is she turning to people she barely knows in a time of crisis? It's also weird that this woman has no strong, lasting friendships with anyone her own age. However, she renews contact with a friend whom she hasn't seen in 15 years (played excellently by Cynthia Nixon who lights up the screen). But Kathy lacks much depth.

It's also bizarre that Kathy spews out words like penis and vagina around her family members as if she were saying ear or elbow. I have lots of family yet we do not have these kinds of crude and vulgar conversations.

Here's the reality: when you receive this kind of diagnosis, you don't go around acting so frivolous.  It's a fantasy to think you throw caution to the wind and do whatever you please. There are very heavy, dramatic emotions you deal with.  People always say, oh, what would you do if you knew your time was limited? as if it would be a pass to do all the things you always wanted to do but never have.  More reality: you can be so sad and depressed and your loved ones can have such a difficult time dealing with this that you don't go around ""living it up"".

Ha, ha, after all this critiquing of the show, I still want to watch the second season.  But still giving it only 3 stars.",1321574400,3,2030,4.36968085106383

4177996,1,B003R4ZMS6,"I rented this set from the library and am I glad I didn't buy it.  Unfortunately I've had far too much experience with cancer, both in my family and my wife's.  The entire premise of the main character going off the deep end, becoming selfish and smoking like a furnace are a little too over the top for my taste.

The husband, played by the talented Oliver Platt, is an out and out pig.  I can't believe Linney's character would be a doormat for him for many, many years before throwing him out.

I resent the poking fun at cancer support groups.  My autistic sister is now in hospice with stage 4 breast cancer and I don't think making fun of people who try to be upbeat while struggling with cancer is the way to go just to ""edgy.""  No thanks.

Linney's brother is an out and out mental case/cartoon who belongs in an institution, living on garbage and hand - outs from hot babes who can't resist him.  I don't know if this some kind of lame satire on far left-wing liberals, but it's unrealistic and poor writing.  His usual response to his sister when she tries to help him is ""F**k you b**ch!""

I think I've just nailed what is really at the core of why I don't like this show: no one is the least big likable or sympathetic, except for maybe the oncologist.

The always-reliable and radiant Laura Linney does what she can with the horrible material she's given (watching porn with her son - a horribly spoiled brat - to get to know him better, freeing a big lobster from a restaurant, buying a brand-new sports car and again, smoking like a furnace when the cancer is already spreading through her body), but this is a definite thumbs-down from this reviewer and I only could stomach the first disc of episodes until I'd had enough.",1314748800,8,1739,4.4

This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.

That makes the direction the series went towards the end of the season all the more dissapointing.

I don't think it would work with anyone else in the title role. She is always good in whatever she is in, but she IS this woman. As a woman with Stage 4 melanoma, its easy to interpret her reactions and actions and think that she shouldn't be approaching it this way.

I found out about my kidney cancer the night before Thanksgiving and there was no way I was going to ruin the holidays for my family.  I also know intimately what it is like to have a cancer that does not respond to treatment and it is possible to look just fine and get around well but also be dying.  This is how people reach stage four without knowing, it is because until cancer becomes painful or grows into your lungs and makes it hard to breathe, there just are not any symptoms.  Most of the illness that people associate with cancer have more to do with the treatments, not the cancer itself.  I know plenty of stage four people that have been on vacations etc.  I loved when she started the coffee enemas, it made me laugh because I do them too and it is the greatest gift.  It takes me from exhausted to normal. I love Laura Linney and dislike her husband intensely.. keep wishing they would find a way to get him off the show. Now that my family knows I'm dying, they really would not find anything about this show funny or entertaining. My spouse runs the other way when I watch an episode.  It just all rang true for me, who also found out late in the game, who also has a cancer that will not respond to chemo and therefore is not bothering to do anything but make the best and most of each day.

In ""Weeds"", Nancy Botwin is pot dealer, and in ""Dexter"", Dexter's a 'good' serial killer. In ""Nurse Jackie"", Jackie is a drug addict/adulterer.

In ""The Big C"", Laura Linney plays a mother and wife, who has spent her whole life doing things for others. She's sacrificed what resemblance of a life she once had for her family. That is, until she figures out she has terminal Stage 4 Melanoma. But instead of having family feel sorry for her, and doing treatment, she decides to live it up. She, at first, tells nobody in her spoiled family about her diagnosis, she kicks her selfish husband out, and decides to make the rest of her life be about her, as well as to find the humor in the disease.

This show is 30 minutes, which should be the length of a comedy. However, there is unexplainable depth to ""The Big C"". Linney, originally a stage actress, brings undeniable, and unavoidable enthusiasm to the role of Cathy Jamison. While the show has a phenomenal supporting cast, she's the standout in every episode. She has a theatrical presence, however, she never over-sells anything, and everything is always believable, because of her knack for bringing gusto to both the comedic and dramatic scenes.

And, I think ""The Big C"", having a first season of only 13 shows, is one of the best first-seasons in the history of television, and here's why. It ends up being something completely different than what it started as. The writers clearly knew where they wanted to do with the characters, as well as the plot. There's real character development here. There's relatable characters that feel like actual human beings, rather than caricatures. Every character is flawed, in a way that works, and it's about them trying to find a middle ground in their ways, and their lives.

""The Big C"" asks us to become attached to a character who is...let's face it, eventually going to die. They make the character of Cathy to be so colorful and dynamic, and strong. The first season alone has made me laugh, cry, and feel real emotion for these characters. I sincerely hope, if this series continues to be as good as it was in the first season, that it goes on for as long as possible. The ending of the series is going to break my heart, but if it stays this good, I'll be there until the end.",1307577600,9,2414,4.62004662004662

I thought it was well cast and had a great story line.  The writers of this show deserve awards for sure.  I too have had cancer and today am considered 'cured'.  So I had an easy time putting myself in the lead characters shoes.  I like they way the writers chose to inject humor into a very serious situation.

4178026,5,B003R4ZMS6,"Laura Linney expertly portrays the initial reaction some have in response to a cancer diagnosis.  My little sister died from this horrible disease at the age of 39, leaving behind two young children.  I saw her go through many stages.  Denial and a reluctance to seek help or support at first is understandable.  If you watch this first-year series to the end, you will see Linney begin to change in how she copes with this disease.  The final few episodes, from the suicide of a wonderful character to the final acceptance by the character's son Adam, should not be missed.  The most important lesson of this first year?  Live your life now, and live it hard.  I cannot wait to see what next year brings.",1292630400,9,705,4.584
4178027,4,B003R4ZMS6,"Laura Linney, the lead actress, is simply wonderful in this role.  Without her I doubt this show would have succeeded.  She brings a very complex, nuanced portrayal to this character, Kathy who has stage 4 melanoma cancer.  She is a married teacher with a teenage son and a husband who works for an ad agency.  Although the husband is creative, he can also be a slob and juvenile at time.  There is no doubt though that he adores her.

There are a few jarring notes in the show which might bother some viewers. One is that she is on a very friendly basis with her oncologist and they even drive around and go to places together.  For example, she accompanies him on his house hunting tour with an agent.  I don't know of any oncologist who gets this up close and personal with a patient but her oncologist is very young. I think it is unlikely that he will last long in this specialty though.

Another jarring note is that she chooses not to tell her husband, her son and her brother that she has cancer.  I've been there, with the news that I have cancer, and I cannot imagine keeping it a big secret.  I don't think I could as one is so numb that one needs the support of family members.  Of course, since she isn't going through chemo or surgery, it is fairly easy to keep it secret.  I had stage 2 colon cancer and certainly did not keep it to myself for an instant. I did have both chemo and surgery though.  She is also not ill in any way through most of the show and that did not ring true with my own experience either.  However, I know some people feel remarkably little pain till the end.

Oliver Platt is very good playing her husband.  He got better and better with each episode.  The parts where he plays an immature jerk irritated me but that was the point. The teenage son also does a good job as does her eco nutso brother. The non family support are the Alzheimer's burdened widow across the street, her basset hound dog, and a large black female teen whom Kathy tries to rescue as one of her students.  Kathy is a teacher and the cancer draws into sharp focus the relevancy of much which she is doing in the classroom.  She is teaching summer school and she realizes these students are not going onto college. So she drastically tries upping the relevance of what she's teaching.

Although I can quibble with these points in the script, overall the writing and production are very good.  Laura Linney is terrific though and that alone makes this a must see.

4178028,4,B003R4ZMS6,"The first few episodes of ""The Big C"" were some of the best episodes of a TV series I've ever seen. Laura Linney plays 40-something Cathy, who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and decides to step back and evaluate her life. She throws her husband Paul (Oliver Platt) out of the house, smothers her teenage son even more than usual, and tries to figure out her next steps, all while keeping her diagnosis a secret from everyone in her life.

Then, about three or four episodes in, the show completely fell apart. Instead of absolutely adoring Cathy and cracking up at everything she said, I wanted to reach through the TV and smack her. She became such a selfish, self-absorbed, spoiled brat. Fortunately, the show reeled Cathy back in and the final few episodes were incredibly good. I still don't understand the surprise death of a supporting character in the second to last episode...that could have been drawn out for a long time, at least another season. I am thrilled that Cynthia Nixon returns as Cathy's BFF, Rebecca, in the season finale, and hopefully she'll be back for most of next season (series regular, anyone?). The final few moments of the finale were incredibly emotional, and I'm really looking forward to where Cathy's journey takes her next season.",1289865600,4,1269,4.821100917431193
4178029,4,B003R4ZMS6,"Cathy Jamison (Laura Linney) is a Midwestern,  middle-class, somewhat jaded teacher whose life is coasting along in neutral (except that she's recently thrown out her Peter-Pan syndrome husband Paul -- the always likable Oliver Platt -- for his frat boy histrionics) -- when she finds out she has stage 4 malignant melanoma.

Much has already been written about the somewhat infuriating way Cathy's reaction to this news plays out in the series.  We are given to believe that a wife and loving mother would be able to keep a secret of such magnitude to herself.  All of the characters surrounding Cathy -- her self-righteous homeless brother Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), her spoiled but very vulnerable son Adam, her pining husband -- accept her extremely strange, out-of-character behavior with a little more than a scratch of the head and a shrug of the shoulders. Her handsome young doctor, who breaks all kinds of ethical boundaries in his relationship with Cathy, tries desperately to get her to tell her loved ones, even as she pushes away all thought of treatment because ""I've always really loved my hair.""  Here is where the series really pushes the bounds of believability.  Any mother who loved her child as much as Cathy appears to would, I believe, try just a tad harder to bargain for more time.

Even with all these gigantic flaws, somehow the series works.  Again, the ensemble cast does a terrific job.  Some of the characters are a little too stock-sitcom-like, with her neighbor Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) as a crusty old lady fighting Alzheimer's and her student Andrea (Gabourey Sibide)coming to mind here.

Idris Elba has a guest-starring role as a sexy painter, and this is the best I've seen him since ""The Wire.""  Cynthia Dixon also appears as Cathy's long-lost college friend, and she is as keyed-up and hard to take as Miranda was in ""Sex and the City"", albeit in a different way.

But I find the series to be entertaining and of course, Linney is top-notch in the role.  While most of the cable series push the boundaries of reality, this one may be one that pushes it the hardest.  Take a large dose of literary license, sit back, and enjoy the ride.  With this character, anything is possible.",1289174400,6,2225,4.83377308707124

4178032,5,B003R4ZMS6,"I am someone who has had cancer so I found the premise of this show interesting.  I have seen three episodes of this show and it is getting better and better.  Kathy, played by Laura Linney, has stage 4 melanoma cancer and has been given a year to live.  Linney does an excellent job with this role.  She has a radical change in perspective and especially in the way she has been spending her time.  Everyone handles cancer in his or her own way and her way is believable.

She separates from her husband because he has been draining her and now she has no more time to waste on being drained by someone else.  She doesn't tell him of her cancer so he is completely baffled as to why his juvenile antics don't amuse her anymore.  She has one son at home, a teenager, and suddenly she has no more patience with his antics either.  She is determined to help him grow up in a hurry. She hasn't told him yet either about her cancer.

Four other characters are the best support though.  One is her black student with a huge overweight problem.  Kathy sets about saving her life.  This is the actress who was in ""Precious"" and she does a wonderful job. The other is her brother, a guy who lives homeless by choice and is crusading against everything. The third is her cranky neighbor who slowly becomes her best friend for the coming ordeal.  The last is the best friend's basset hound who has an affinity for people dying of cancer.

Although this has funny moments, I would not bill it as a comedy as Amazon has done.
