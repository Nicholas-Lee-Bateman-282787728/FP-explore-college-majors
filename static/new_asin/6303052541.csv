7835996,5,6303052541,"This movie just touched me !!!  I don't want to give away the details but Bonnie Bedelia ( a WONDERFUL actress ) gives a moving performance as a young mother who is dying and wants to leave a ""Message To My Daughter"" using a tape recorder.  The 70's was a GREAT decade for some TV Movies !!!",1292630400,4,291,4.087719298245614
7835997,5,6303052541,"Seeing this film years ago prompted me to write messages to my second child... Not for the same reason that the young mother in this film (Bonnie Bedelia in a strong early performance) left messages for her child, but because I was so moved by the idea after seeing this film.

Bonnie Bedelia and Martin Sheen (two favorite actors, seen here in early roles that witness to their talent) play a young couple with a little girl, Miranda (played by Kitty Winn).  Miranda loses her mother at a young age and gets to know her for the first time as she is coming of age (and is 'down' on parents, and on society in general) through listening to the cassette tapes her mother (Bedelia) tape-recorded for her when she learned she was dying 18 years earlier.

This is a heartfelt, moving film for any mother or daughter, and the performances are surprisingly good.  There is a 1960's feel to this film, but because it deals with universal experiences (parent-child relationships and coming-of-age tensions and potentials), it doesn't really matter when this film was made -- it has timeless appeal.

A truly beautiful film that stays with you. Highly recommended.",1137801600,13,1154,4.778894472361809
