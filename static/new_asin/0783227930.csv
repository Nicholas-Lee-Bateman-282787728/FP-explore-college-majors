53772,4,0783227930,"A complete bomb at the time of its release because audiences went expecting a typical Clint Eastwood actioner and instead got this eeire drama about the sexual mind games between a wounded Union Soldier and the  ""inmates"" of an all-girls Southern school.  Nearly thirty years  later, we can appreciate the film's artistic qualities, the almost surreal  direction, and the uniformly wonderful acting.  And we can certainly admire  Eastwood and legendary director Don Siegel for striking out in a new  direction with high quality material.",922233600,15,537,5.321428571428571

53778,5,0783227930,Ive already ordered this in Blu Ray and despite the period settingits still timely due to the recent sexual allegations against prominent figures.  Also the recent remake cant even hold a candle to this cult classic since in the remake a character has been removed and secrets about the main character are not shown. This film and Play Misty For Me showed that Clint could do more than play an action hero.  I doubt if John Wayne could ever do a movie like this.,1511913600,,462,4.488095238095238

53785,5,0783227930,"Doesn't disappoint in 2017 even after Coppola's butchering it! I remembered seeing in the 70's and patiently waited for 2017 version. This movie's many layers truly explore not only the desperation the American Civil War inflicted upon Americans, but human nature regarding the combination of both lust and survival. This movie is a snapshot and an authentic portrayal of how  war can effect the male female relationship from opposing sides and the manipulation tactics still used today even without the war back drop. This 5 star raw and dramatic period piece has survived all these years and the only good thing about Coppola's watered down and lame version is the next generation and all those who have never seen it before  have taken an interest in this version again.",1506902400,2,773,4.984496124031008

53814,5,0783227930,"This is a sophisticated and compelling film. A fine example of Southern Gothic with its cruelty and darkness. Characters are morally ambiguous and are both the agents of the tragedy that unfolds, and its victims. The film notes the importance of the war in brutalizing a soldier and deconstructs the stereotype of the Southern belle. It is a tale full of deception, manipulation and revenge, worthy of Poe. The outstanding character in the film is the slave Hallie, who adds strength, integrity and moral insight to the story - the moment when she refers to McBurney as a slave is a key moment in the film's thematic development, complicating the ideas of power, agency and of loyalty. As a thriller the film maintains intensity throughout and as a rich film text it rewards repeated viewings. One of Clint Eastwood's finest performances, on a par with later classics such as Unforgiven.",1499385600,,887,4.92

53819,5,0783227930,"""THE BEGUILED"" was an unusual departure for Clint Eastwood at the time, as this and ""PLAY MISTY FOR ME"" were arguably two of the best movies for both Eastwood's Malpaso Company and Universal Pictures in the early 1970s. coming out of the 1960s with the Sergio Leone Italian westerns that United Artists released, making Clint Eastwood a household name, ""THE BEGUILED"" was a first in his career, in a mixture of gothic meets gritty reality during the Civil War as Eastwood's ""McBirney"" character is seriously injured, discovered by a little girl picking mushrooms, before succumbing from his wounds, where the little girl, played by then child and teen actress Pamelyn Ferdin, takes the wounded Yankee to a mansion, run by a headmistress with an all school for girls. the lady of the mansion played coldly and seductively by Geraldine Page, is reluctant to take in the injured soldier, but allows it despite the risks to the other students. McBirney is almost immediately taken an interest to the school teacher, played by the late Elizabeth Hartman, and eventually, he discovers that the other girls, including the head lady, has become somewhat attracted to him, thus creating an intimate and fragile situation that results in passions getting out of control, while evading capture by Union confederates. the somewhat suspenseful conclusion to the movie was both wicked and coldly vengeful, but ultimately a well made Gothic civil war drama that was one of a kind, as well as a departure from his Man with No Name romps in Spain, ""THE BEGUILED"" delivered a successful well-made drama that put Clint Eastwood into the top money making movies of the early 70s before director Don Seigel introduced audiences to ""DIRTY HARRY"", another critical hit for Eastwood's movie career. Geraldine Page gives an unforgettable performance as a cold, but sinisterly seductive woman who is morally bankrupt and desperate for a man, despite her shame in her incestuous affair with her own brother, or Hartman's ""Edwina"" character, who was so sincere, but vulnerable, but the main character here is little Amy, who, after McBirney discards her pet Turtle, goes emotionally nuclear, and becomes a young slayer, poisoning the soldier with toxic mushrooms before the film ended, but not before having his leg amputated after being pushed down the stairwell from Edwina's jealous outburst. Bottomline: this is a great movie and something of a first for Eastwood before the Dirty Harry movies made him a solid star! I would strongly recommend ""THE BEGUILED"" to die-hard fans of Eastwood cinema, who will not be disappointed by this movie's Gothic content or its unfortunate conclusion, it is a worthy movie to enjoy! recently remade by director Sophia Coppola in 2017, the Clint Eastwood original is still the greater superior here!",1498089600,,2809,5.108695652173913
53820,2,0783227930,"I decided to watch this movie because a remake is coming out and I thought I'd like to see the original first. Glad I did. Well, no, actually, I wish I had never seen this movie, and I am glad only in that it has protected me from seeing the new version, which likely is more graphic and creepy. Clint Eastwood's version is well done for the time, which is to say very dated with its Civil War characters dressed and coiffed quite stylishly for 1971 viewers. Even Clint's hair is never out of place. The main characters are morally gray and emotionally unstable, and so you watch the action with distaste, not rooting for any one character among a cast of depraved manipulators. The story is less historical fiction than gothic horror.",1497916800,6,735,4.533834586466165

53827,4,0783227930,"It's a compelling, under rated, lurid thriller that grips you like a vice. But one thing mystifies me. Clint Eastwood is the big commercial name here obviously, and it's certainly his film - to a certain extent. But the reason it's so good is not Clint Eastwood - it's Geraldine Page. This is her film as much as his. She is the great actress. She is the electrifying, dangerous character in the mix, and without her monumental talent, this would not be the film it is. And in many reviews she's barely mentioned. This woman was a legend, and as an actress, she wipes Clint Eastwood, as good as he is - right off the map. Apparently Nicole Kidman is playing this role in a remake. I like her as an actress, but why she agreed to do this role when Page has done it, is a mystery. She's not even in the race, and it hasn't even opened yet. Colin Farrell, yes.",1494288000,,857,4.263803680981595

53846,4,0783227930,"Released in 1971 and directed by Don Siegel, The Beguiled is set in in the Deep South during the Civil War. As Union troops increasingly invade, the headmistress of a girls boarding school (Geraldine Page) decides to allow a Union soldier with a leg wound to stay at the school (Clint Eastwood), supposedly until hes strong enough to turn over to the Confederate authorities as a POW. To survive, McB (Eastwood) manipulates the gaggle of women and girls, which include Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), Carol (Jo Ann Harris), 12 year-old Amy (Pamelyn Ferdin) and a slave (Mae Mercer). Darleen Carr plays the loyal Confederate patriot, Doris, while Melody Thomas Scott plays the child Abigail.

William Congreve wrote the famous saying in his play The Mourning Bride (1697) Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned (paraphrasing). That pretty much reveals the theme of The Beguiled. While McB tries to survive by beguiling the women through charm & trickery, the viewer shouldnt underestimate how formidable and wrathful the female species can be, particularly in the face of jealousy.

For me, the story takes a downturn in the final act and therefore leaves a sour taste, but I guess it fits the tragic genre. You cant really hold it against the film. Still, sympathy for McB is squelched when he does something heinous (think Amy). To his credit, he later apologizes with seeming sincerity. As far as Im concerned, though, the entire third act needed rewritten, but I accept the movie as is. Its unique and theres enough depth to glean new gems on repeat viewings. Weve all met women (or girls) just like the devilish Carol (Harris).

The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in Louisiana, USA.

The writing and acting in this movie is solid and it is very different. He plays a wounded soldier taken in by a women's foster home/shelter and he manipulates and woos all of them sort of methodically. They have no men around do to the war and he prob hasn't been with a women in awhile due to the same circumstances.

Coming right after his unique man-with-no-name spaghetti westerns with Sergio Leone,  here was an Eastwood we didn't think possible-a wounded Union soldier taking refuge of-necessity in a deep South (you see the Spanish moss from frame one) girl's boarding school.  The ladies can't send him to P.O.W. camp until he's healed, and while they're waiting he seduces(?) succumbs to(?) his young hostesses charms.  6 students, one teacher, a female slave, and the headmistress (Geraldine Page), who was apparently incestuous with her long-gone brother for quite some time.  Let's put it this way..Corporal MacBurney, or one of the women, is going to lose, and that's it.
  Most Southerners turn their noses up at Hollywood attempts to cinematically capture the war between the states IN the South..they never quite seem to pull the spirit of the thing off.  But the Beguiled succeeds admirably.  ""Ya'll 'll never guess what they do to Eastwood.""  Not if you don't see it.

53878,4,0783227930,"This 1971 terminally strange film is a very, very atypical thing in Clint Eastwood's career and therefore worth discovering. I am quite glad that I finally watched it as it was one of the very, very few movies with Eastwood which I didn't see. Now I still have to watch ""White hunter, black heart"", ""Honky Tonk Man"" and ""Pink Cadillac"" and then I can die in peace...))) Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Close to the end of the American Civil War, an injured Yankee soldiern corporal John McBurney is rescued from the verge of death by a twelve-year-old girl from an all-girl boarding school in Louisiana. At first the all-female staff and pupils are scared, but as John starts to recover, he charms them one by one...

Directed by Don Siegel, this film is an adaptation of the novel ""Painted Devil"", which belongs to the very peculiar genre of Southern Gothic. This kind of stories usually describes weird, decadent, depraved and shocking situations in the American South - and this story definitely qualifies.

I will not say much about the story to avoid spoilers, but let's just say that this is a disturbing film, including allusions (but not showing openly) of lesbian fantasies, incest, interracial rape, castration, underage sex and REALLY underage sex... It contains also scenes of animal cruelty, mutilation and really cold blooded, cruel murder. Finally it is also a study of enslavement - and it is not the lonely black character that is the most targeted... With that much depravity involved, small wonder that the French consider this as one of the most important films in Eastwood's career...))) Indeed, it is shown in permanence in some small specialised Parisian cinemas in Quartier Latin...

Clint Eastwood never cared much for this film, as his character here is really not only a rather bad guy (a manipulative, lying and cheating scumbag who is also a really mean drunk), but especially a stupid (albeit by moments cunning) loser...

The women are not much better either in fact. The middle aged headmistress of the school Martha Farnsworth (Geraldine Page) lived already a lot and many a time in her life she woke with the taste of hell in her mouth... The other teacher, much younger but not very attractive, shy and mousy Edwina Dabney (Elizabeth Hartman) is absolutely desperate to find herself a man, any man, with whom she could leave the school - a place she both loves and passionately hates... Gorgeous 17 year old Carol (Jo Ann Harris) is basically a slut tormented by the merciless urges of flesh... Only the black slave Hallie (Mae Mercer) and the youngest girl, 12 years old Amy (Pamelyn Ferdin) are more likeable - even if the latter will ultimately be manipulated in doing something really horrible...

Once again, this is a disturbing, but interesting film, definitely worth seeing. Be certain to watch t the end, as the very last scene is a monument of black humour...))) ENJOY!",1412899200,2,2942,4.885771543086173

53893,4,0783227930,"After Clint Eastwood became a big star with ""The Man With No Name"" spaghetti westerns and before he made it even bigger as ""Dirty Harry,"" he and director Don Siegel teamed up to make this highly unusual western.  Mishandled by the studio's marketing group, the film never found an audience and bombed.  It is certainly worth seeking out, providing an interesting contrast to Eastwood's aforementioned film roots.

He plays Cpl. John McBurney, a Yankee sniper in the Deep South in the middle of the American Civil War.  Severely injured and near death, he is found by a 12 year old girl who lives at a nearby school for girls.  Although he's just a ""blue belly,"" young Amy (Pamelyn Ferdin) helps him hide as Confederate troopers ride by.  Not sure of Amy's willingness to keep quiet, ""McB"" plants a long kiss on the girl.  Yep, caught me by surprise too.  Rather than recoil, she's startled but not upset.

In any case, the pair find their way back to the school where the matron in charge (Geraldine Page) agrees to mend the corporal before turning him over to the rebel army.  McB's leg is broken and he has other wounds caused by an explosion.  As he becomes more aware of his surroundings, McB plans his escape but not before he takes advantage of his surroundings.

Martha (Page) is a hard-nosed, no-nonsense woman with no man in her life now that her brother has not been heard from and presumed dead.  The role plays her to be a bit older than McB although in real life Page and Eastwood were about the same age.  In an effective use of flashbacks we learn that the siblings were...well, let's say engaged in more than typical brother and sister activities.  We also learn that Martha isn't just interested in boys.  She also has a crush on her headmistress, Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman).

But 22 year old Edwina, like the rest of the girls (ages range from about 11 to 19) has a big hankering for the corporal.  McB's head is swimming with all the attention and plays it for all it's worth.  One of the girls, 17 year old Carol (Jo Ann Harris) who is particularly attractive and sexually aggressive puts some moves on McB that stirs the pot even more.

When McB accepts a job after the war with Martha she has a steamy dream involving a tryist including McB and Edwina.  Later, McB receives an invitation from lonely and bisexual Martha, virginal Edwina and the horny Carol to visit them at night.  McB heads for Carol first and they get it on, only to be discovered by a pissed off Edwina.

When the corporal takes a fall down a long flight of stairs, he is reinjured to the point where his broken leg cannot be repaired.  As jealousy and McB's true intentions are revealed, the ladies take a much different view of his presence.  This is certainly one of Eastwood's better performances and shows some actual acting skills.  The film is dark and occasionally ominous and certainly provocative.  The DVD is old and cloudy with crummy mono sound and in need of a Blu ray update.  Calling Criterion!",1361577600,,3002,4.581613508442777

In this tale he plays something of a scoundrel, a Union soldier who lies as to how he was wounded to get sympathy and is then taken in by a boarding school for women in Louisiana. He then goes about charming the women in different ways, arousing sexual attraction in the older women and the need for male approval in the child-women. But things get out of hand as he begins to have sexual affairs with multiple women and they all find out. One of the reasons for doing this was to show that women could be dastardly and evil, too, according to one of the people behind the project and detailed in the special features section of the film. It was not well received because Clint was against his usual typecast and playing a bad person to boot as well as the fact that the studio didn't know how to market it (""One man...seven women...in a strange house!"" ""His love... or his life..."" ). The script was written by Albert Maltz and is based on the 1966 Southern Gothic novel written by Thomas P. Cullinan, originally titled A Painted Devil. The film marks the third of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, following Coogan's Bluff (1968) and Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), and continuing with Dirty Harry (1971) and Escape from Alcatraz (1979).

53905,4,0783227930,"My wife and I watch a lot of Clint Eastwood movies late at night and enjoy them very much. Last night we watched ""The Beguiled."" Strange movie! It took place during the Civil War in the south. Eastwood, a northerner, was badly wounded and rescued by a young girl from an all girls school who took him back to the school to recover. All of this was very risky business, because we were, after all, in a civil war and he was the enemy. The school consisted of about a half dozen young ladies plus two supervisors and a slave/maid. Eastwood was the only man on the premis. He began a gradual recovery and as he recovered, he began ""hitting"" on the women, everything from a 12-year-old to the owner of the school. Alas, he was finally caught in bed with a 17-year-old and and the resulting flap ended with him getting one of his legs amputated by the girl's school staff. It's a long and complicated story, believe me. As the movie proceeded, he finally got poisoned by his 12-year-old savior who had rescued him in the first place. Strange, twisted story!

I don't quite what to think about all of this. It's an entertaining movie to watch, to be sure, but very strange. I'm tempted to label it a comedy, but it certainly would be a dark, strange and twisted humor. The amputation was quite gruesome and my wife had to leave the room. In a lot of ways, Eastwood played a sympathetic character, but he also earned his amputation and ultimate death. Very unusual movie.

53908,5,0783227930,"This Civil War era gothic is one of the more, if not the best, acting turns of Clint Eastwood's career.  It's relative obscurity probably lies in the fact that the film contains little action per se and that Clint's hobbled Union soldier is left to the tender mercies of some apparently helpless Southern belles.  At first Eastwood's McB's actions apparently stem from self-preservation-he'd rather bide this time at the genteel girl's finishing school than fester in a Confederate prison.  However, the twin devils of lust and power, or lust for power, rears it's ugly head.  As McB manipulates the women by meticulously reading their psyches he manages to draw them to his bed.  However, his duplicity is slowly unmasked and the wrath of the women is unleashed.  ""The Beguiled"" is both mesmerizing and shocking.  The twists and turns of it's story will put you at the edge of your seat.  Besides Eastwood the women in the cast are uniformly excellent notably the renowned Geraldine Page as the incestuous head mistress, Elizabeth Hartman as the virginal schoolmarm, and young Pamelyn Ferdin as the girl who initially saves McB but also feels betrayed by him.  Eastwood's acting and directing career is uniformly illustrious and you will not get a complete picture unless you've seen ""The Beguiled"".",1265500800,16,1300,5.037383177570093

A film rather unlike any other I've seen (the closest movie I can think of would probably be Misery, but they're significantly different), The Beguiled concerns a Union soldier who finds himself convalescing in a house full of dangerous Southern woman while the war rages outside them; full of Freudian undertones and skillfully directed by Don Siegel, this is a different type of Eastwood movie that might surprise you.

Civil War themes, Southern Gothicism, 1960s discourses on race and sexual liberation, and a persistent brooding myth-and-symbol approach evocative of classical Greek tragedy provide a heady and disturbing brew.

I won't try to retell the film.  See it.  Suffice it to say that Eastwood plays a wounded Yankee soldier taken in by the head mistress and students of a girl's school in Louisiana during the Civil War.  Not wanting to be turned over to the Confederates, Eastwood reckons that he can manipulate these horny women to his own advantage...and...for a while, he seems to get away with it.  Of course what he does it not only 'bad and wrong' it is downright dangerous and the women see to it that Eastwood plays the full price for his folly.

53914,5,0783227930,"To be honest, I never heard of this movie nor knew about Clint Eastwood's role in it until I came across the DVD in my local library. Well, I took it home, and couldn't play it! So then, I search through Netflix, and of all the good luck, it was available for instant play - and boy, am I glad I watched it! This is definitely uncharted territory for Eastwood, and in a role I'd never envision him in. He does a great job in it and so do all the other cast members, making this one of the most under-rated movies considering the well-written script, the great casting and creepy score.

The story centers around Ms Farnsworth's Seminary for Girls somewhere in the South during the Civil War. Young Amy [Pamelyn Ferdin], one of the girls, is out picking mushrooms when she comes across badly hurt Yank Cpl John McBurney [Clint Eastwood]. She helps him back to the school where the Headmistress Martha Farnsworth [Geraldine Page] is at first determined to hand him over to the Confederates but then decides against it. Prissy schoolmarm Edwina Dabney [Elizabeth Hartman] is also drawn to the charming Yank and so are young Amy and Carol [Joann Harris playing a tarty role here].

Soon, the dashing John is getting the young and not-so-young ladies all hot under the collar and with the Southern heat, things really get toasty! But, this is not your average romance story - it is more of a psychological thriller set against a Southern Gothic backdrop - there is the feisty and hardened Headmistress who is also harboring a secret of her own, the schoolteacher with hidden yearnings, the hussy with an insatiable appetite, and an impressionable young girl experiencing her first crush. Ol' Clint doesn't exactly come across all nice either, so there's plenty of tension here between the main characters. The acting is great on all fronts from Eastwood's charming yet manipulative Yankee to the vulnerable schoolteacher [Elizabeth Hartman], Geraldine Page's aging yet lusty school head and even 'sweet' young Amy [Pamelyn Ferdin]

The great story and casting aside, the creepy score builds up the suspense in a chilling manner and the ending is one of the more memorable ones I've seen in movies. I was quite puzzled as to why this movie is not as well-known as some of Eastwood's other movies, and found that most of his movies that were against type typically didn't do too well at the box-office[Play Misty for Me, White Hunter Black Heart]. Well, personally I liked this movie as well as Play Misty and I would heartily recommend The Beguiled to those who like psychological thrillers, Gothic inspired dramas, and of course, Clint Eastwood!",1224720000,,2640,4.81057268722467

53916,4,0783227930,"'the beguiled' defies classification.  it's not a western, though it turns up on encore's western channel occasionally.  it's best as a period southern gothic melodrama filled with many treasures and a few surprises and only one major disappiontment.

among its assets are stunning performances from its three leads.  clint eastwood shows that he had the chops to create a character until he traded in for image with the 'dirty harry' films.  in his hands, john mcburney is a silver-tongued trap of a man whose presence fires deep emotions in all of the women that come in contact with him.

geraldine page is at her steely best as headmistress martha farnsworth.  farnsworth is the type of complex character that drives many a film nowadays.  she is fleshly, yet presses all her desries and heartaches down until she becomes a seemingly cold and unfeeling woman.  but as the story unfolds, it becomes obvious that she is capable of deep emotion.  page doesn't miss a single opportunity to explore each layer of this difficult character.

she is equalled by the fantastic elizabeth hartman as the young assistant head edwina dabney.  hartman was an actress out of her time.  had she come along now, she would rival any of the young actresses that rack up critical accolades for showing vast amounts of flesh in a misguided attempt to reveal character.  hartman, at turns, is delicate, strong, angry, volatile, tender and loving in a role that could be two dimensional.

in the supporting cast, which is largely female, mae mercer, darleen carr and pamelyn ferdin are standouts.  mercer invests the role of servant hallie with strength and grit; carr provides some comic relief as the wary uber-southern belle doris and ferdin is simply the best child actress of the 1970s based on this one performance.  everyone from the director to robert surtees to the screenwriter has gotten together to create a little girl that is sweet in her innocence, heartbreaking in her love for mcburney and finally chilling when given the chance to exact revenge for a very large infraction committed by the object of her adoration. and ferdin's work is so natural, unforced, and throughly played.

the cinematography is tops and the screenplay, which could have become hackneyed, is very much in control of the source material.  it has to wrestle with different sounds and inflections, the ghost of some very aberrant behavior and a country at odds with itself in a time when it was very divided on so many issues.

the film falters only with the casting of jo ann harris as the seductive carol.  she is a nubile blonde woman but she is somehow awkward in her teasing games, which affects her seduction of mcburney.",1217376000,2,2697,4.89647577092511

He is found by a young girl (apr. 12) who is a student at a southern girls' school run by a strict school mistress with very patriotic (Confederate) sympathies. Eastwood manages to persuade the girl (with a kiss) not to raise an alarm and notify the Confederate soldiers in the area. He further manages to charm the women at the school into helping to heal him and delaying reporting his presence to the authorities.

Eastwood manages this feat by telling each of the women and girls what he thinks they want to hear. He can appear pious, loving, patriotic, amorous or any other way that will appeal to whatever woman he comes into contact with ranging from the schoolmistress to the slave woman who helps out around the place. He manages to convince each of them that she is his primary interest. When things begin to go bad, they go very bad indeed and the women realize that they have created a monster. Their method for dealing with the monster is fairly monstrous itself.

53923,4,0783227930,"Another well done moral ambiguity piece where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for.

If nothing else ""The Beguiled"" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in 1971. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed.

Pamelyn Ferdin did a fine job as Amy and would go on to play ""Wanda June"". This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle ""Randolph"", it is no surprise that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist.

Geraldine Page was likewise excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It is interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) as they had also worked together in ""You're a Big Boy Now"".

Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar (no other performance was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in ""The Misfits"", the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing.

Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty Carol. For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the ""Most Wanted"" television series and the only reason to watch ""Wild Wild West Revisited"". Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1113264000,19,2033,4.677871148459384
53924,5,0783227930,"""The Beguiled"" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with ""Play Misty For Me"". An alternate title considered for the film was ""Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation"", which thankfully was not used, otherwise I am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls' school would be difficult to avoid. I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid-1970's, and was immediately taken with it. I only had an old battered VHS tape of it until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious, awful trailer (which made me laugh out loud, the trailer makes it sound like a ""Peyton Place"" soap opera, and conveys none of the creepiness of the film).

Eastwood and Siegel had to battle with Universal Pictures to keep the original ending, and they won out. However, the film was billed as a western, which it certainly is not. It is a gothic tale of deception and horror that is set in the time of the Civil War, and an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension runs throughout the film.

I'm not putting any spoilers in this review, and if you want to see the film as it should be seen, then be careful of looking this film up on the internet, as spoiler reviews of it do abound.

Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on Confederate ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school. She rescues him and takes him back to the school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison, the headmistress, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their black female servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and the mostly teenage girls take him in, heal him, and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of creepiness and Gothic horror right from the titles, as it shows real battleground shots from the war, while Eastwood's voice is heard quietly singing a funereal song of the time. The opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character, and the tone of the entire movie. To say any more than that would spoil the surprise of their first encounter. To say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it...if you are into creepy, Gothic horror, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early, or any role, where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic.

Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as the headmistress, I cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role; a long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner. Her performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination, IMO.

Elizabeth Hartman (who also did a wonderful performance in the film ""A Patch of Blue"" as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character) is at her prime here, delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, her delicacy on film was also a part of her real life; she committed suicide at a young age, having battled depression on and off throughout her brief, and extremely talented, life.

I end this review with this observation: one manipulative, lying Yankee man is no match for a houseful of deceptive and libidinous Southern belles.",1104451200,11,3538,4.590189873417722

53926,5,0783227930,"If you've gotten a chance to see Don Siegel's films then you know enough to expect some violent rock'em sock'em action.  The new DVD of THE KILLERS illustrates that, with even Ronald Reagan grim and nasty as all get out.  In THE BEGUILED, Siegel takes on a kind of George Cukor subject, a girls academy during the period of the American expansion of the Civil War, run by Geraldine Page, the Broadway actress who had a brief run of major Hollywood parts perhaps ten years prior to this film.  The BEGUILED was a kind of comeback for her, although of course her fans don't ordinarily see it that way, preferring to think that she remained big while the pictures grew small, which in a way of course is very true.  She's dynamite in her scenes with Clint Eastwood, with whom she shares a rebellious spark of iconoclasm.  If you've seen her tearing up the screen in SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH with Paul Newman, you'll recognize the way she can command the screen and make tough men cry.

In later years this film was unofficially re-made, with James Caan and Kathy Bates in MISERY.  MISERY, directed by Rob Reiner, was a kind of homage to the central storyline of THE BEGUILED, with Clint as a kind of prisoner to a crazy woman, and oh, what happens to their legs in both films is shocking even by today's standards.

Some people actually prefer MISERY but for me, I would like to see THE BEGUILED rather than MISERY because the older film also has Elizabeth Hartman in a smallish part, and she's always worth a trip to Netflix or whatever.  And Pamelyn Ferdin, the little girl from WHAT's THE MATTER WITH HELEN and THE MEPHISTO WALTZ, is adorable and spooky as the girl who saves Clint Eastwood at first, only to lead him to Page's door.",1092960000,4,1728,4.49520766773163

53928,5,0783227930,"The Beguiled is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen,contributing to my early love of cinema,and sadly remaining underrated to this day.
While it is hard to pigeonhole the film into one specific genre, be it a thriller or a psychological drama,it is one of the very few films that without the use of blood and gore,manages to be very disturbing and violent. A raw and primitive violence that is directed more at the viewer's mind and psyche.
Don Siegel is one of the best American directors,who like Sam Peckinpah,understood the meaning of this violence and did not shy away from showing it without tantalizing the 'voyeur' in his audience.
His collaboration with Clint Eastwood is one of the most successful in cinema..(Dirty Harry, Coogan's Bluff, Escape from Alcatraz, Two Mules for Sister Sarah)..And with the Beguiled he managed to direct an original film that had the best performances his star had to date,(a transitional role in Eastwood's career, in between the westerns of Leone, and the toughness of Harry Calahan.)
The whole mood of the film has this creepy and sinsiter atmosphere that appears quite subtle on the surface,yet as your delve deeper,it slowly unleashes  much darker and well hidden forces.
It is the story of a wounded Yanky soldier(Clint Eastwood)evading capture in the south during the civil war,finds refuge in an all girl boarding school. The headmistress (the geart Geraldine Page)takes him in and provides him with a sanctuary and care that befits her Christian duties and sensibilities. Yet this stranger awakens many feelings in the house: curiosity,jealousy,sexual fantasies, up to the will and determination to murder.
The increased confidence of the recuperating soldier in manipulating the sexual vulnerablity of these girls and their headmistress,goes hand in hand with the change that occur within them,from gentle and virtuous to cold and calculating.
I liked the fact that the contrast between the raging war outside and the serene and peaceful sanctuary inside turns to be only an illusion.
I liked too the fact that despite the rift that the soldier caused directly and indirectly among the girls,they at the end link their fates and bond together,like they carefully did in the face of war, even if this means getting rid of the 'disturbance' that turned their world upside down.
I also loved the fact that ultimately the message of the film is about what a person is capable of doing in certain circumstances, and how a ideal world can hide many deep hidden frustrations that,pushing the right buttons, can be as menacing and deadly as any war.
What is quite interesting too, is how a deeply religious environment and person, can also hide strong sexual desires and energy that are truly haunting. One particularily powerful scene, among many, is the sexual threesome dream that Page has,an unrestrained and perverse passion mixed with religious guilt: an explosive mixture.
The Beguiled reflects a time when directors had the artistic freedom and clout to make the film they wanted. The original script had a happy ending, but Siegel opted to change it to its darker conclusion, something very few studios would allow these days.
The Beguiled is a powerful movie that on no accounts should be missed. A journey into the darkest recesses of the human soul that you will not easily forget.",1070150400,20,3347,5.041516245487364

The two things I remember most from my childhood viewing of this film were Clint Eastwood's reaction to his amateur surgery and the little school girl's last line about the difference between good and bad mushrooms. Over thirty years later, I rewatched this film on DVD and I'm still fascinated by this creepy, yet highly erotic, southern-gothic tale. The story takes place in the South during the American Civil War. A little girl (Pamelyn Ferdin) is hunting in the woods for wild mushrooms and finds the badly injured Union soldier, Cpl. John McBurney (Clint Eastwood). She takes him back to her small, all-girls boarding school, where the Head Mistress (Geraldine Page) decides to let the soldier recover from his injuries, rather then immediately turn him over to the Confederate authorities. As McBurney starts to get stronger and healthier he precedes to start sexually seducing and manipulating all of the female staff and some of the students. But is he the one  manipulating them or is it really the other way around? Sexual longing, jealousy and paranoia seem to be the main subjects being taught at this school. Things get so crazy (and erotic), that one really disturbing night, McBurney finds himself the subject of some table top surgery at the hands of the head mistress! Was the Head Mistress really trying to save his life or was she just being sexually vindictive? McBurney dosn't like what the ladies have done to him. He attempts to regain charge of the school and the situation, but the women serve the soldier up his just desserts in a very memorable and eerie ending! Long time Director, Don Siegel (""Dirty Harry"", ""Coogan's Bluff"") has crafted a tense and claustrophobic film, that can really get under your skin. The film reminds me of one of those old 'EC' comic books (you know the ones your mother didn't want you warping your minds on...), where the bad guy eventually recieves some creepy, unworldly retribution for his misdeeds. But who actually is the bad guy in this film? Eastwood? The Head Mistress? The other women? I think the movie leaves this question open for interpretation. The acting in the movie is superb! Eastwood breaks out of his ""Man with No Name' persona and really gives us an interesting characterization. We never know, what he is going to do next. Veteran, Broadway actresses Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman both give some great,'over the top', scenery chewing  performances. I love watching both their characters (the Head Mistress & the young teacher) seem to crumble in hysteria right before the viewer's eyes! The DVD to the film is pretty bares bones with little in extras (just a trailer). The picture is O.K. but the sound remastering is awful. But don't let that stop you from seeing this southern-gothic gem! If you want a tense, suspenseful film, which just might keep you up at night, then I highly recommend ""The Beguild"".",1067212800,6,2985,4.862475442043222

The atomosphere is suitably weird and bizarre to create a shroud like atmosphere that ultimately envelops one of Eastwood's amoral protagonists.

Jealousy and tension rises between everyone in the school until the drama catches up with the man in the most horrific ways possible.

53933,4,0783227930,"Clint Eastwood gives a rare ""arthouse"" performance in this decidedly off-beat Civil War tale. Clint is the wily fox trapped in the proverbial henhouse as a wounded Union soldier discovered in the woods and nursed back to health by the members of a Southern girls' school. Director Don Siegel (who played Scorcese to Eastwood's DeNiro in a series of 70's collaborations) was not usually associated with making ""art"" movies, but this one came the closest. Mostly somber and Gothic in tone, with a dash of black comedy thrown in (especially in the scenes where Eastwood gleefully manipulates and seduces various teachers and students). Of course, the chauvinistic soldier eventually gets his due (Stephen King style), but it's an interesting ride along the way. Geraldine Page leads the excellent supporting cast in top form. The depiction of the girls' mass sexual panic amid a claustrophobic, fever dream atmosphere recalls films like ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" or ""Black Narcissus"". Eastwood's boldest performance features a scene in the opening moments that very few ""movie stars"" would even touch...where he kisses a 12 year old girl in a somewhat lustful manner; repellent behavior, yes,  but essential to establishing the character. In other words, don't expect another typical Eastwood shoot-'em up!",1014595200,8,1302,5.320388349514563
53934,4,0783227930,"Clint Eastwood is Corporal John McBurney, a wounded Union soldier  given shelter and medical attention at a girls school during the Civil War.  They intend to allow him to heal before turning him over to the authorities.  But then he starts to take a liking to the ladies - and they to him.  He woos and charms them (independent of the others), partially  for obvious reasons and partially to keep peace - otherwise they might turn him in, which would certainly result in his dying in prison.  Soon the women compare notes on ""their"" man, and McBurney soons finds himself in over his head.  Gothic, stylish, and unpredictable; with a few twists and turns that may startle a first-time viewer.  Geraldine Page (as the headmistress) does an impeccable job and is perfect in her role.  Eastwood gives an excellent performance, stepping out of his usual screen persona.  A hidden Eastwood classic that needs a second look.",995760000,,918,4.826923076923077
53935,5,0783227930,"The Beguiled caught me off guard. We rented it knowing only that it took place during the Civil War, it was made during Eastwood's peak years, and that he had sideburns that looked out of place but really cool. I expected an okay movie that would be The Man With No Name kicks butt in the Civil War, but instead I was completely amazed. I'm glad I went into it knowing little about it, because I just got more and more impressed and into the movie as it went on.
Eastwood plays a 'Yank' officer, Corporal John McBurney (or ""Mac"") who is wounded and taken in by some sort of boarding school for girls in a remote country location. The school is actually a Southern mansion that reminded me of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland from the outside. The residents are all female and include a headmistress with a pretty  sick secret in her past, a black 'servant' who turns out to be nobody's slave, and several teenage girls. Also, since all the men have been off at war for awhile, they are all pretty sexually frustrated. To keep them from turning him over to the south, where he will almost certainly die of his wounds in a miserable jail, Eastwood's character tries to charms all of them. With some of them, he knows how to play their weak points against them. This unfortunately works a little bit too well, because at least 3 of the women  end up having the hots for him so bad that they end up in various stages of fooling around  with him.  Mac gets WAY more than he bargained for, with more tragic, ugly, and terrible results than you could imagine. Anyone who sleeps with 3 women living in the same city let alone the same house should know that if you are fooling around with 3 women living under the same roof, sooner or later they're going to compare stories, and the whole thing will end up with several women very, very mad at you.  Anyway, I knew that at some point he'd get caught with his pants down, and someone would probably get violent at some point, but the way it happens, the timing of it, and the results were all completely unpredictable and stunning.
I don't want to say more about the plot too much other than to set it  up, because the best moments for me came when  a character said or did the last thing I expected them to -either that, or something that I thought might happen did, but with the last character I expected to do it being involved. Eastwood does do his tough guy thing, but there's way more sexuality, not all of it pleasant, thrown in than usual, and his character is definitely more than 'The Man With No Name'.  And boy, if you thought his other movies had some tough, cold-blooded characters in them...you ain't seen nothing yet.
It was only till hours a after I saw the movie that I realized the category it fell into was Southern Gothic...probably one of the best and most powerful I've ever seen. I think this is the only CE movie that made my husband laugh, comment on how cool Eastwood looked and acted,  gasp in shock,and cringe to the point of actually covering his eyes all at once in one viewing. I had the same reaction. I'm dying to comment more on the plot developments, the characters, and the moments that blew me away the most, but I don't want to spoil it  for anyone, because this is a movie best viewed for maximum effect when you know less about those things.
The Beguiled was way ahead of its time , especially when it comes to strong women, or black female characters that are even stronger. It also probably didn't do as well because the audience was used to seeing Eastwood play a hero (and definitely not used to seeing him as  an invalid in one way or another for so much of the movie) and also because audiences wanted a Hollywood ending.  I think women who don't especially care for CE films in general would probably find themselves enjoying this one.
There are several shocking things that happen, and enough sex and violence to definitely make it R-rated- this is NOT a movie for kids or the faint of heart. The acting, the story, and the dialogue are all so amazing and original, and it's intense, suspenseful, and brilliant. I highly recommend this lesser known, underrated gem. And yes, definitely get it on DVD or video because if it runs on anything other than cable, I'm sure that many scenes that are important to the plot and have great impact to the characters would probably be snipped. You'll just have to see it for yourself.",994464000,108,4413,4.434567901234568
53936,5,0783227930,"This disturbing, haunting southern gothic film from director Don Siegel is one of the best, if least known, Eastwood films.
Set in the deep South during the Civil War, Eastwood plays a wounded Northern soldier brought to a nearby, nearly deserted all-girls school to be treated before being turned over to the Confederate Army.  As long suppressed desires begin to surface in the headmistresses and some of the students, Clint slowly begins to play the women against each other in a bid to avoid being turned in.  Unfortunately, such passions can give way to much darker feelings and actions.
Clint is excellent in a role that falls between villain and hero, and he is matched by the wonderful women in the cast.  As the senior headmistress, the remarkable Geraldine Page delivers one of her most controlled and effective film performances. And Elizabeth Hartman very movingly portrays naive longing and reticence.  Her performance here easily matches her more famous one in ""A Patch Of Blue"".  Mae Mercer is fine as the wry slave who sizes Clint up from the start, and the cast of young actresses playing the students are all equally fine.
One of the most striking things about the film is the use of color and light.  The deep hues and dark shadows are among the richest ever captured on film, while the use of natural light, especially the evening scenes and the candlelit scenes, are stunning.  The deep sound is also excellent.
Unfortunately, this video edition fails to capture this.  The color is washed out almost beyond belief compared to the earlier video editions and the sound is thin with a noticeable hiss on the track. The earlier video editions were excellent, so there's no excuse for Universal's slipshod work on this one.
Five stars for the film; one for the video.  This great movie deserves to be seen, but in a better edition.",990921600,10,1848,4.822784810126582

53939,5,0783227930,"I don't know what it is, but we in the South just love a movie about the Civil War.  It does not matter whether it is historically accurate or politically correct; if it takes place down here, we eat it up.
Well,  ""The Beguiled"" is set in the South, so that's its first plus.  Secondly, it has Clint Eastwood as a Union soldier ""rescued,"" so  to speak by a household headed by Geraldine Page.  And third, the rest of  the residents are young women, enamored of Eastwood.
Eastwood's character  takes advantage of the innocence and adoration of the manor's occupants.  His John McBurney is not an evil man, but a flawed one, at best.  Eastwood  does a good job at conveying that fact.  Unfortunately his actions have a  devastating result.
Page, like contemporary Coleen Dewhurst, was one of  stage and screen's best.  She is perfection in her role as Martha  Farnsworth.  Elizabeth Hartman, who never had much of a Hollywood career,  is quite good, also.  Mae Mercer, as the maid, has some interesting  exchanges with Eastwood.
The remaining cast is made up largely of young  unknowns.  They do admirable work as the objects of Eastwood's machinations  and desires.",961200000,7,1164,4.7727272727272725

As he starts to recover, one by one  he seduces the sexually repressed women and the atmosphere becomes filled  with jealousy, deceit and brutal revenge.
Eccentric, offbeat melodrama  combining the conventions of both Western and Grand Guignol chiller, and  directed as if it were an art movie, this is one of Eastwood and Siegel's  strangest collaborations. Beautifully shot (especially the nightmarishly  skewed first person camera perspective of that famous amputation scene, and  chiaroscuro lighting effects [such deep, dark shadows]}, carefully paced,  this is a haunting, elegant work that seems to have influenced the much  later - and inferior - Misery.
No disc extras as such, but excellent  production notes, and a crystal-clear transfer with well-preserved colour  separation make this an essential DVD purchase.
