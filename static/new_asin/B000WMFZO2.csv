2987138,5,B000WMFZO2,"Royal Rumble 1998 to 2002. 5 Royal Rumble matches. 5 winners. 150 men. Who won? (I am only making a review for the Royal Rumble MATCHES because I want to make this a short review)

Royal Rumble Match 1998: 4/5
Some people would think that this match was too long ago and it would have too many boring people. Well it didn't. A whole lot of long-lasting entrants and most of them, you would probably know. (The Rock, Stone Cold, JBL, Vader, Mick Foley, Ron Simmons, Terry Funk etc.) This was a great and long Royal Rumble match that was awesome to finally watch. Recommended!

Royal Rumble Match 1999: 3/5
The was the worst Royal Rumble match I've ever seen. It was only based on a heated rivalry between Stone Cold and the McMahons. Mr. McMahon spent one half of the entire hour being a commentator. Too many people got involved with people other than Stone Cold. Not worth watching AT ALL! Overall, the PPV wasn't terrible.

Royal Rumble Match 2000: 4.5/5
FINALLY we get up to a really good Royal Rumble match!! This kicked off one of the best years in the history of this business. Although this had way more people getting involved than 1999, it turned out fantastic. A lot of anticipated crowd reactions. This is my 3rd or 4th favorite Rumble match ever. 100% RECOMMENDED also.

Royal Rumble Match 2001: 5/5 !!
Now THIS is the best Royal Rumble Match I've ever seen. It had weapons, a special guest comedian, a large amount of superstars at once sometimes, and large amount of build up. 5 Stars for the entire PPV also!!!!!

Royal Rumble Match 2002 4/5
Not bad, but was very boring at most points. This is not a recommended Royal Rumble to watch. It had a pretty entertaining beginning with rising stars. This was the longest Royal Rumble match ever in history and I couldn't believe I sat through it all. PPV itself was neutral.

Overall, this summed up great matches during the attitude era. I would always find 1 or 2 of these seperate for the same cost as all of them combind in this volume. I saved a lot of money is a really good thing to watch when you're bored.

2987139,5,B000WMFZO2,"1998 - The big event here is the casket match between Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker because not only was Shawn's back damaged by a backdrop onto the top of the casket forcing him into a four and a half year retirement, but this also set up the original Kane-Undertaker clash at Wrestlemania 14. The Rumble Match was won by the marked man Stone Cold Steve Austin and featured a hardcore chair throwing chainsaw fight between Chainsaw Charlie and Cactus Jack. In addition, Mick Foley goes into mutiple personality mode as Dude Love, Mankind, and Cactus Jack all appear. The LOD battle for the tag belts against the New Age Outlaws, The Rock defends the IC belt against Ken Shamrock, Goldust battles Vader, and there's a midget match with Sunny as the referee.

1999- The 1999 event was a mess plain and simple...including a Rumble Match that featured Vince Mcmahon running scared from Stone Cold, a Corparate team ambush in a bathroom, the Undertaker sacrificing Mable and a bunch of dead time as each of these events unfolded. Make sure the remote on your DVD or Blu Ray has a quick fast forward button because the Rumble was painful to sit through. Mankind and The Rock battle in an epicly perverse I Quit Match, but I think it's available on another WWE DVD but I can't be positive...if it's not that's the reason to see this show.

2000- The Rumble redeems itself in Madison Square Garden. Kurt Angle is choked out by a debuting Tazz, The Hardy Boyz and The Duddley Boys meet in a tables match, the first of their major encounters that would eventually include Edge and Christian. The Miss Rumble swimsuit competition, fast forward and save the trip to the facilities. Chyna and Chris Jericho finish off the co-champion storyline as they defend their title in a triple threat with Hardcore Holly. In a nothing tag title defense the New Age Outlaws battle the Acolytes. The Rock and The Big Show begin debating who really won the Royal Rumble storyline that led to the four way Mcmahon thing at Wrestlemania. In the main event, Triple H defended the WWF title against Cactus Jack in a street fight, only to be topped by their Hell in a Cell Match at No Way Out.

2001- Another solid effort from the WW- as Edge and Christian put tag team gold up against the Dudleys. Chris Jericho had a ladder match with Chris Benoit over the Intercontinental Championship. Ivory and Chyna started the Right to Censor neck injury storyline. Kurt Angle defended the WW- Championship against Triple H featuring varying degrees of involvement from Stephanie-Trish- and Stone Cold Steve Austin, speaking of Austin, he would go on to win the rumble despite HHH's best efforts.

2002- Not as good as previous years, but still solid improvement over 1999. Triple H completed his injury comeback by besting Kurt Angle in the Rumble match. Chris Jericho battled the Rock over the Undisputed WWE championship in the match of the evening. Ric Flair and Mr. Mcmahon staggered around in street fight between two fifty year olds. Edge challenged Willam Regal for the Intercontinental Championship. Tazz and Spike Duddley defend their tag titles against the Dudley Boyz.

1998 - Royal Rumble this year saw the return of Mick Foley entering the Rumble Match under all three of his personas (Cactus Jack, Mankind, & Dude Love). This is the first Rumble Match that gets ""hardcore"" as we see the chair swinging Cactus Jack and Terry ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Funk go off on one another, the Nation Of Domination members fighting each other, the Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart incident, and everybody in the Rumble Match gunning for Stone Cold Steve Austin. Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker faced off in a Casket Match for the WWE Championship that led to HBK being out for four years & the ending with Kane lighting the casket on fire with the Undertaker inside to set up their match at WrestleMania. Other bouts from this Rumble includes Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Vader vs. ""The Artist Formely Known As"" Goldust, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom, and a Six Man Mini Match with Sunny as the referee.

1999 - This year's Royal Rumble was a bit of a lackluster as the Rumble Match was centered by the Austin/McMahon feud as again everybody in the match gunning for Austin to collect the bounty McMahon placed on Austin's head. Also Chyna making history by being the first woman to enter the Rumble Match. But the match that stands out the most is the violent ""I Quit"" Match as WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock where Mick Foley took a dozen unprotected chair shots to the head. The rest of the card is pretty much below average as it holds Hardcore Champion Road Dogg vs. Bossman, Intercontinental Champion Billy Gunn vs. Ken Shamrock, X-Pac vs. Gangrel, & Woemn's Champion Sable vs. Luna in a Strap Match.

2000 - The Royal Rumble came back to Madison Square Garden as it hosts a historic Street Fight between WWE Champion Triple H and Cactus Jack, Tazz making his WWE debut as he broke Kurt Angle's undefeated streak, and the first ever Tables Match as the Dudley Boyz took on the Hardy Boyz. The Rock won the Rumble Match this year as it was average at best while having some funny moments that includes Rikishi & Too Cool getting down and Funaki being eliminated the most times in a Royal Rumble Match and to include a special entrant from Bob Backlund. Also on this Royal Rumble card was the Triple Threat Match for the I.C. Championship as the Co-Champions Chyna & Chris Jericho went against Hardcore Holly, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes, and a Miss Rumble Bikini Contest where it has Mae Young flashing her ""puppies"" that scared the living heck out of Jerry Lawler and leaving everybody in the arena grossed out.

2001 - New Orleans hosted this year's Royal Rumble Match with Stone Cold winning it for a record third time, Drew Carey making a appearence and eliminating himself, Kane being dominate like nobody else has ever been in a Rumble Match and eliminating a record of 11 superstars after entering at #6, the Big Show making his return, and the interaction between Austin/Triple H and Austin/The Rock. Other matches from this night includes WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Triple H as it was higlighted by the Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon catfight, Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz for the Tag Team Championship, Women's Champion Ivory vs. Chyna in a match that led to Chyna re-injuring her neck, and a classic Ladder Match as Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.

2002 - This Royal Rumble was highlighted by many big returns in Mr. Perfect, Goldust, Val Venis, & the Godfather with Triple H also making his PPV return and in the end winning the Royal Rumble Match. But the true highlight of the Rumble Match was the rookie Maven doing the unthinkable and eliminating the Undertaker. Other bouts from the night are Ric Flair also returning to PPV as he took on Mr. McMahon in a Street Fight, Edge vs. William Regal for the Intercontinental Championship, Tazz & Spike Dudley vs. Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz, Women's Champion Trish vs. Jazz, and the Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. The Rock.

Overall I recommend this set. Only with one Rumble not being so good as the other four (that being 1999), this is a good set to add to your collection.",1242777600,,4385,4.644329896907217
2987142,1,B000WMFZO2,"The first disk is AWESOME! But the last 4 disks are awful! I was really disapointed with the blurred portions. I realize that while they had to change the name from the WWF to the WWE because of the lawsuit they were only trying to protect themselves by doing this. HOWEVER, it gets pretty annoying when the wrestlers step into the blurred portions and you can no longer tell what excatly they are doing! I own the Rey Mysterio Set which operates during the same time period and it doesn't have any blurred spots in it. Personally I would never have purchased this if I had known about the blurryness, it was a complete waste of money!",1206230400,4,635,4.435897435897436
2987143,5,B000WMFZO2,"I bought this along with Volume 4 recently and let me say it was worth the money! D.P. has already done an excellent description of the matches so I'll just highlight the reasons to get this one by the years on this volume.

Royal Rumble '98 - The Rumble match itself (which saw one of the first PPV face-offs between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock) and the WWF/WWE title Casket Match between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels where Shawn injures his lower back and was forced to retire until 2002. Also has a pretty good match between Ken Shamrock and The Rock for the I-C belt.

Royal Rumble '99 - Mankind Vs. The Rock in an ""I Quit"" WWF/WWE title match that saw Mick Foley (Mankind) take multiple chair shots from The Rock unprotected! The rest of the Rumble is okay with the worst match being a strap encounter between Sable and Luna Vachon.

Royal Rumble 2000 - One of my favorites to watch! A near perfect card and probably the most violent of all the Rumble's during the Attitude Era. Tazz makes his debut from ECW to break the undefeated streak of Kurt Angle. The Hardyz and The Dudley Boyz (Team 3-D) had an amazing Tables match that was one early predecessor to the TLC matches we see today. A three way battle for the I-C title which saw Co-Champs Chris Jericho and Chyna battle each other as well as Hardcore Holly for the belt. That one was okay as well as The APA Vs. The New Age Outlaws for the tag belts. The main reason to get this is the incredible street fight between Cactus Jack and HHH for the WWF/WWE title! While HHH says Hell In The Cell with Mick Foley is what put him over as a wrestler, I feel this match is what brought him respect in my view!

The Rumble itself was pretty good on this one too. It saw The Rock win.

Royal Rumble 2001 - Two main reasons to get this one is the ladder match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho for the I-C belt and the Rumble itself. The Rumble match is memorable for three reasons (at least for me):
1. Kane's near one hour performance - For man his size and stature, that's a feat to go one hour!

2. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Rock - Another face-off between these two legendary performers.

3. Austin winning The Rumble for a third time! To this day, he's still the only 3-time winner of this match!

Royal Rumble 2002 - Another favorite Rumble card of mine. Here is how I break it down on this one:

Spike Dudley/TAZZ VS. The Dudley Boyz w/Stacy Kiebler (WWF/WWE Tag Team Championship) - Not a great bout but it doesn't suck either! Some very hard hitting spots that are very ECWsqe!

Edge Vs. William Regal (WWF/WWE I-C Title Match) - Probably the only stinker on the card. Edge and Regal are actually very good workers but this one wasn't as good their other encounters.

Trish Stratus Vs. Jazz (WWF/WWE Women's Title Match) - Surprisingly good match. Jazz was the superior wrestler and worker in this one because this was at the beginning of Trish's in-ring career! Still, you could see her give it her best effort even early on. Also, having Jackie in there as the special ref added some comedy to the bout.

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Vince McMahon (Streetfight Match) - This was also another surprise. McMahon and Flair worked very well together!

Chris Jericho Vs. The Rock (WWF/WWE Undisputed Championship Match) - I have never seen their first encounter from No Mercy 2001 but if its anything like this match, then I am sure I'd love it! These two put on a great match! Probably the best between the two!

The Royal Rumble Match - Was very well paced and probably the strongest line up since The Royal Rumble 1992 at that point! While it was pretty obvious that HHH was going to win, it at least gave us some great action leading up to the end. I find it ironic since the best Royal Rumble took place in 1992, that we get another great one 10 years later! The moment of the match (for me) is when Kane picked up The Big Show in a bodyslam position and actually carried TBS to the top rope and dumped him out! I don't care if wrestling is fake, that takes some strength right there!

Overall, your $30 something bucks will not be wasted!",1201996800,,4130,4.3803921568627455
2987144,5,B000WMFZO2,"Personally, the Attitude Era was the greatest time for me to be a wrestling fan. All the great characters, the electric atmosphere, hell even the wrestling good. This set is filled with some great moments from the Attitude Era that will bring back so many memories. With this set you get some classic WWF title matches like the Casket Match between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, the classic ""I Quit Match"" between Mankind and The Rock, the Street Fight between Triple H and Cactus Jack, and a very underrated contest from the '02 Rumble with Chris Jericho and The Rock. Then your going to get some good Royal Rumble matches like the 1998, 2000, 2001, & 2002 Royal Rumble matches.

If that's not enough to convince you to buy this set then let me just say your going to also get great filler matches like the 1998 Intercontinental Title Match with The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, the 2000 Tag-Team Table Match between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz, the 2001 Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title between Chris Jericho and Chris Beniot, and the 2000 debut of Tazz against Kurt Angle.

If you want in depth review of each Royal Rumble then see those DVD's individually but as a whole this set is great and should not be missed. In my opinion it was worth every cent.",1201824000,,1274,4.583333333333333

1998 - The Rumble once again comes to the Bay Area of northern California at the San Jose Arena with a special guest in boxing legend Mike Tyson watching the show from a skybox in the arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Ken Shamrock, Chyna, Steve Blackman, Mark Henry, and Michael Cole.  The main story going into the Royal Rumble battle royal was Steve Austin responding to the claims of being a marked man in the match by attacking the participants for weeks leading up to this match to the point where all the action in the ring stopped & everyone waited on him once it was time for him to enter the match with other highlights include Mick Foley & Terry Funk picking up where they left off the previous year, who was attacked on his way to the ring & got his payback later on, who took up to six men to be eliminated, every Nation member for himself, and who had up to three different chances to win the match.  Undertaker competed in his second Casket Match in WWE history facing off against WWE Champion Shawn Michaels with D-Generation X members Triple H & Chyna in his corner in a match that's mostly remembered for not just the bump Shawn took on the casket that began the end of his career at the point but who decided to make their appearance leading to an aftermath that left everyone speechless.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom, Vader vs. Artist Formerly Known As Goldust, and a six man match featuring the mini-wrestlers from Mexico with Sunny as the special referee.

1999 - Two years in a row that the Rumble came to the west coast of California only this time at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim.  The special theme was ""No Chance In Hell"" as Mr. McMahon was determined to make sure Steve Austin didn't win the match & receive a WWE Title match at WrestleMania to the point where he made Austin the first entrant, put himself in the Rumble match (with Shawn Michaels making him #2), and put out a $100,000 reward on whoever eliminated Austin leading to such moments as the entire Austin-McMahon saga, the circumstances surrounding the eliminations of Mabel & Kane, and Chyna becoming the first woman to compete in the match at #30.  The match that had everyone talking after the event was the WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock in an ""I Quit"" match that started off as a brawl that went all over ringside to just downright brutal with the image of Mankind handcuffed & taking close to a dozen chairshots to the head to the point where his wife took the kids away from ringside because it was too much to handle with this match being detailed more in the film ""Beyond The Mat.""  Other matches include Road Dogg vs. Big Boss Man, Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs. Billy Gunn, European Champion X-Pac vs. Gangrel, and Womens Champion Sable vs. Luna in a Strap Match.

2000 - The Rumble for the first time comes from WWE's home of Madison Square Garden in New York City featuring the Rumble debuts of Jonathan Coachman, Tazz, Hardy Boyz, Dudley Boyz, Ivory, The Kat, Mae Young, Chris Jericho, Stephanie McMahon, Christian, and Big Show.  The Rumble match this year featured such highlights as a couple of men who weren't legally entered into the Rumble invading the match leading to one man taking a vicious over the top face plant & another being eliminated more times in a single Rumble match than anyone else in Rumble history, Too Cool & Rikishi, one man making surprise appearance who was also running for Congress, and the interaction between Big Show & The Rock.  WWE Champion Triple H faced off against Mick Foley's most dangerous persona of Cactus Jack in a Street Fight match that saw both men just beat the hell out of each other all over ringside with blood pouring from more than just one part of the body, various weapons including chairs & thumbtacks & ""Barbie"", more than one person making an appearance to make a difference in the match, and an aftermath where one man refused to let the other leave on a stretcher.  The first ever Tables Match happened between The Hardys & Dudley Boyz that saw both men use tables in ways that haven't been previously seen in WWE either as weapons or the unique ways people were put through them.  Other matches include Taz's debut vs. Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly to determine the undisputed Intercontinental Champion, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. A.P.A., and a Miss Rumble 2000 bikini contest where we saw it all from bubble wrap to a very old set of puppies.

2001 - This year's event took place in Louisiana from the New Orleans Arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Chris Benoit, Trish Stratus, Raven, Perry Saturn, K-Kwik a.k.a. R-Truth, and William Regal.  The Rumble match itself had it's various highlights such as a few guest appearances from comedian Drew Carey to the return of a former World Champion & later a WCW champion who appeared on their PPV the week before, a new Royal Rumble record set that wouldn't be broken for over a decade, the Rumble getting hardcore, not even the spanish announce table being safe, a reunion between ""brothers"", and how one man entered the match a bloody mess.  WWE Champion Kurt Angle defended the championship against Triple H but the biggest story surrounding the match was fact that Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were the managers for this match with each girl having a big issue with the other to the point where it did boil over into a fight that had everyone in the ring stop what they were doing & causing the one person caught in the middle to try to break it up.  The first ever Ladder Match in Rumble history occurred as Chris Benoit defended his Intercontinental Title against Chris Jericho in a very physical match that saw not only the ladder used but a chair as well to the point where the winner didn't walk out 100%.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz & Womens Champion Ivory vs. Chyna.

2002 - This edition of the Rumble took place at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta, GA & was the first Rumble held since the demise of both World Championship Wrestling & Extreme Championship Wrestling resulting in the Rumble debuts of Stacy Keibler, Spike Dudley, Jazz, Lance Storm, Maven, Shane ""Hurricade"" Helms, Diamond Dallas Page, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T.  The Rumble match itself featured various highlights such as the 4 returns of Val Venis & Goldust & The Godfather complete with one of the biggest ""Ho-Trains"" in history, the biggest upset elimination in the history of the match...and the aftermath of it, one legends outstanding performance that earned himself a job, another Rumble record being set, the in-ring return of Triple H & who was waiting for him in the ring, and when it got down to the final four.  Ric Flair returned to his old WCW hometown of Atlanta for his in-ring return in a Street Fight against fellow co-owner Mr. McMahon in a street fight that turned out to be bloody & aggressive between both men with Flair's family sitting in the front row to witness everything.  Other matches include WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. The Rock, Intercontinental Champion Edge vs. William Regal, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, and Tag Team Champions Spike Dudley & Tazz vs. Dudley Boyz.",1194739200,13,7362,4.659984579799537

1998 - Royal Rumble this year saw the return of Mick Foley entering the Rumble Match under all three of his personas (Cactus Jack, Mankind, & Dude Love). This is the first Rumble Match that gets ""hardcore"" as we see the chair swinging Cactus Jack and Terry ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Funk go off on one another, the Nation Of Domination members fighting each other, the Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart incident, and everybody in the Rumble Match gunning for Stone Cold Steve Austin. Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker faced off in a Casket Match for the WWE Championship that led to HBK being out for four years & the ending with Kane lighting the casket on fire with the Undertaker inside to set up their match at WrestleMania. Other bouts from this Rumble includes Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Vader vs. ""The Artist Formely Known As"" Goldust, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom, and a Six Man Mini Match with Sunny as the referee.

1999 - This year's Royal Rumble was a bit of a lackluster as the Rumble Match was centered by the Austin/McMahon feud as again everybody in the match gunning for Austin to collect the bounty McMahon placed on Austin's head. Also Chyna making history by being the first woman to enter the Rumble Match. But the match that stands out the most is the violent ""I Quit"" Match as WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock where Mick Foley took a dozen unprotected chair shots to the head. The rest of the card is pretty much below average as it holds Hardcore Champion Road Dogg vs. Bossman, Intercontinental Champion Billy Gunn vs. Ken Shamrock, X-Pac vs. Gangrel, & Woemn's Champion Sable vs. Luna in a Strap Match.

2000 - The Royal Rumble came back to Madison Square Garden as it hosts a historic Street Fight between WWE Champion Triple H and Cactus Jack, Tazz making his WWE debut as he broke Kurt Angle's undefeated streak, and the first ever Tables Match as the Dudley Boyz took on the Hardy Boyz. The Rock won the Rumble Match this year as it was average at best while having some funny moments that includes Rikishi & Too Cool getting down and Funaki being eliminated the most times in a Royal Rumble Match and to include a special entrant from Bob Backlund. Also on this Royal Rumble card was the Triple Threat Match for the I.C. Championship as the Co-Champions Chyna & Chris Jericho went against Hardcore Holly, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes, and a Miss Rumble Bikini Contest where it has Mae Young flashing her ""puppies"" that scared the living heck out of Jerry Lawler and leaving everybody in the arena grossed out.

2001 - New Orleans hosted this year's Royal Rumble Match with Stone Cold winning it for a record third time, Drew Carey making a appearence and eliminating himself, Kane being dominate like nobody else has ever been in a Rumble Match and eliminating a record of 11 superstars after entering at #6, the Big Show making his return, and the interaction between Austin/Triple H and Austin/The Rock. Other matches from this night includes WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Triple H as it was higlighted by the Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon catfight, Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz for the Tag Team Championship, Women's Champion Ivory vs. Chyna in a match that led to Chyna re-injuring her neck, and a classic Ladder Match as Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.

2002 - This Royal Rumble was highlighted by many big returns in Mr. Perfect, Goldust, Val Venis, & the Godfather with Triple H also making his PPV return and in the end winning the Royal Rumble Match. But the true highlight of the Rumble Match was the rookie Maven doing the unthinkable and eliminating the Undertaker. Other bouts from the night are Ric Flair also returning to PPV as he took on Mr. McMahon in a Street Fight, Edge vs. William Regal for the Intercontinental Championship, Tazz & Spike Dudley vs. Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz, Women's Champion Trish vs. Jazz, and the Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. The Rock.

Overall I recommend this set. Only with one Rumble not being so good as the other four (that being 1999), this is a good set to add to your collection.",1242777600,,4385,4.644329896907217
3221639,1,B000WMFZO2,"The first disk is AWESOME! But the last 4 disks are awful! I was really disapointed with the blurred portions. I realize that while they had to change the name from the WWF to the WWE because of the lawsuit they were only trying to protect themselves by doing this. HOWEVER, it gets pretty annoying when the wrestlers step into the blurred portions and you can no longer tell what excatly they are doing! I own the Rey Mysterio Set which operates during the same time period and it doesn't have any blurred spots in it. Personally I would never have purchased this if I had known about the blurryness, it was a complete waste of money!",1206230400,4,635,4.435897435897436
3221640,5,B000WMFZO2,"I bought this along with Volume 4 recently and let me say it was worth the money! D.P. has already done an excellent description of the matches so I'll just highlight the reasons to get this one by the years on this volume.

Royal Rumble '98 - The Rumble match itself (which saw one of the first PPV face-offs between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock) and the WWF/WWE title Casket Match between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels where Shawn injures his lower back and was forced to retire until 2002. Also has a pretty good match between Ken Shamrock and The Rock for the I-C belt.

Royal Rumble '99 - Mankind Vs. The Rock in an ""I Quit"" WWF/WWE title match that saw Mick Foley (Mankind) take multiple chair shots from The Rock unprotected! The rest of the Rumble is okay with the worst match being a strap encounter between Sable and Luna Vachon.

Royal Rumble 2000 - One of my favorites to watch! A near perfect card and probably the most violent of all the Rumble's during the Attitude Era. Tazz makes his debut from ECW to break the undefeated streak of Kurt Angle. The Hardyz and The Dudley Boyz (Team 3-D) had an amazing Tables match that was one early predecessor to the TLC matches we see today. A three way battle for the I-C title which saw Co-Champs Chris Jericho and Chyna battle each other as well as Hardcore Holly for the belt. That one was okay as well as The APA Vs. The New Age Outlaws for the tag belts. The main reason to get this is the incredible street fight between Cactus Jack and HHH for the WWF/WWE title! While HHH says Hell In The Cell with Mick Foley is what put him over as a wrestler, I feel this match is what brought him respect in my view!

The Rumble itself was pretty good on this one too. It saw The Rock win.

Royal Rumble 2001 - Two main reasons to get this one is the ladder match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho for the I-C belt and the Rumble itself. The Rumble match is memorable for three reasons (at least for me):
1. Kane's near one hour performance - For man his size and stature, that's a feat to go one hour!

2. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Rock - Another face-off between these two legendary performers.

3. Austin winning The Rumble for a third time! To this day, he's still the only 3-time winner of this match!

Royal Rumble 2002 - Another favorite Rumble card of mine. Here is how I break it down on this one:

Spike Dudley/TAZZ VS. The Dudley Boyz w/Stacy Kiebler (WWF/WWE Tag Team Championship) - Not a great bout but it doesn't suck either! Some very hard hitting spots that are very ECWsqe!

Edge Vs. William Regal (WWF/WWE I-C Title Match) - Probably the only stinker on the card. Edge and Regal are actually very good workers but this one wasn't as good their other encounters.

Trish Stratus Vs. Jazz (WWF/WWE Women's Title Match) - Surprisingly good match. Jazz was the superior wrestler and worker in this one because this was at the beginning of Trish's in-ring career! Still, you could see her give it her best effort even early on. Also, having Jackie in there as the special ref added some comedy to the bout.

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Vince McMahon (Streetfight Match) - This was also another surprise. McMahon and Flair worked very well together!

Chris Jericho Vs. The Rock (WWF/WWE Undisputed Championship Match) - I have never seen their first encounter from No Mercy 2001 but if its anything like this match, then I am sure I'd love it! These two put on a great match! Probably the best between the two!

The Royal Rumble Match - Was very well paced and probably the strongest line up since The Royal Rumble 1992 at that point! While it was pretty obvious that HHH was going to win, it at least gave us some great action leading up to the end. I find it ironic since the best Royal Rumble took place in 1992, that we get another great one 10 years later! The moment of the match (for me) is when Kane picked up The Big Show in a bodyslam position and actually carried TBS to the top rope and dumped him out! I don't care if wrestling is fake, that takes some strength right there!

Overall, your $30 something bucks will not be wasted!",1201996800,,4130,4.3803921568627455
3221641,5,B000WMFZO2,"Personally, the Attitude Era was the greatest time for me to be a wrestling fan. All the great characters, the electric atmosphere, hell even the wrestling good. This set is filled with some great moments from the Attitude Era that will bring back so many memories. With this set you get some classic WWF title matches like the Casket Match between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, the classic ""I Quit Match"" between Mankind and The Rock, the Street Fight between Triple H and Cactus Jack, and a very underrated contest from the '02 Rumble with Chris Jericho and The Rock. Then your going to get some good Royal Rumble matches like the 1998, 2000, 2001, & 2002 Royal Rumble matches.

If that's not enough to convince you to buy this set then let me just say your going to also get great filler matches like the 1998 Intercontinental Title Match with The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, the 2000 Tag-Team Table Match between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz, the 2001 Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title between Chris Jericho and Chris Beniot, and the 2000 debut of Tazz against Kurt Angle.

If you want in depth review of each Royal Rumble then see those DVD's individually but as a whole this set is great and should not be missed. In my opinion it was worth every cent.",1201824000,,1274,4.583333333333333

1998 - The Rumble once again comes to the Bay Area of northern California at the San Jose Arena with a special guest in boxing legend Mike Tyson watching the show from a skybox in the arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Ken Shamrock, Chyna, Steve Blackman, Mark Henry, and Michael Cole.  The main story going into the Royal Rumble battle royal was Steve Austin responding to the claims of being a marked man in the match by attacking the participants for weeks leading up to this match to the point where all the action in the ring stopped & everyone waited on him once it was time for him to enter the match with other highlights include Mick Foley & Terry Funk picking up where they left off the previous year, who was attacked on his way to the ring & got his payback later on, who took up to six men to be eliminated, every Nation member for himself, and who had up to three different chances to win the match.  Undertaker competed in his second Casket Match in WWE history facing off against WWE Champion Shawn Michaels with D-Generation X members Triple H & Chyna in his corner in a match that's mostly remembered for not just the bump Shawn took on the casket that began the end of his career at the point but who decided to make their appearance leading to an aftermath that left everyone speechless.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom, Vader vs. Artist Formerly Known As Goldust, and a six man match featuring the mini-wrestlers from Mexico with Sunny as the special referee.

1999 - Two years in a row that the Rumble came to the west coast of California only this time at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim.  The special theme was ""No Chance In Hell"" as Mr. McMahon was determined to make sure Steve Austin didn't win the match & receive a WWE Title match at WrestleMania to the point where he made Austin the first entrant, put himself in the Rumble match (with Shawn Michaels making him #2), and put out a $100,000 reward on whoever eliminated Austin leading to such moments as the entire Austin-McMahon saga, the circumstances surrounding the eliminations of Mabel & Kane, and Chyna becoming the first woman to compete in the match at #30.  The match that had everyone talking after the event was the WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock in an ""I Quit"" match that started off as a brawl that went all over ringside to just downright brutal with the image of Mankind handcuffed & taking close to a dozen chairshots to the head to the point where his wife took the kids away from ringside because it was too much to handle with this match being detailed more in the film ""Beyond The Mat.""  Other matches include Road Dogg vs. Big Boss Man, Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs. Billy Gunn, European Champion X-Pac vs. Gangrel, and Womens Champion Sable vs. Luna in a Strap Match.

2000 - The Rumble for the first time comes from WWE's home of Madison Square Garden in New York City featuring the Rumble debuts of Jonathan Coachman, Tazz, Hardy Boyz, Dudley Boyz, Ivory, The Kat, Mae Young, Chris Jericho, Stephanie McMahon, Christian, and Big Show.  The Rumble match this year featured such highlights as a couple of men who weren't legally entered into the Rumble invading the match leading to one man taking a vicious over the top face plant & another being eliminated more times in a single Rumble match than anyone else in Rumble history, Too Cool & Rikishi, one man making surprise appearance who was also running for Congress, and the interaction between Big Show & The Rock.  WWE Champion Triple H faced off against Mick Foley's most dangerous persona of Cactus Jack in a Street Fight match that saw both men just beat the hell out of each other all over ringside with blood pouring from more than just one part of the body, various weapons including chairs & thumbtacks & ""Barbie"", more than one person making an appearance to make a difference in the match, and an aftermath where one man refused to let the other leave on a stretcher.  The first ever Tables Match happened between The Hardys & Dudley Boyz that saw both men use tables in ways that haven't been previously seen in WWE either as weapons or the unique ways people were put through them.  Other matches include Taz's debut vs. Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly to determine the undisputed Intercontinental Champion, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. A.P.A., and a Miss Rumble 2000 bikini contest where we saw it all from bubble wrap to a very old set of puppies.

2001 - This year's event took place in Louisiana from the New Orleans Arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Chris Benoit, Trish Stratus, Raven, Perry Saturn, K-Kwik a.k.a. R-Truth, and William Regal.  The Rumble match itself had it's various highlights such as a few guest appearances from comedian Drew Carey to the return of a former World Champion & later a WCW champion who appeared on their PPV the week before, a new Royal Rumble record set that wouldn't be broken for over a decade, the Rumble getting hardcore, not even the spanish announce table being safe, a reunion between ""brothers"", and how one man entered the match a bloody mess.  WWE Champion Kurt Angle defended the championship against Triple H but the biggest story surrounding the match was fact that Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were the managers for this match with each girl having a big issue with the other to the point where it did boil over into a fight that had everyone in the ring stop what they were doing & causing the one person caught in the middle to try to break it up.  The first ever Ladder Match in Rumble history occurred as Chris Benoit defended his Intercontinental Title against Chris Jericho in a very physical match that saw not only the ladder used but a chair as well to the point where the winner didn't walk out 100%.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz & Womens Champion Ivory vs. Chyna.

2002 - This edition of the Rumble took place at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta, GA & was the first Rumble held since the demise of both World Championship Wrestling & Extreme Championship Wrestling resulting in the Rumble debuts of Stacy Keibler, Spike Dudley, Jazz, Lance Storm, Maven, Shane ""Hurricade"" Helms, Diamond Dallas Page, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T.  The Rumble match itself featured various highlights such as the 4 returns of Val Venis & Goldust & The Godfather complete with one of the biggest ""Ho-Trains"" in history, the biggest upset elimination in the history of the match...and the aftermath of it, one legends outstanding performance that earned himself a job, another Rumble record being set, the in-ring return of Triple H & who was waiting for him in the ring, and when it got down to the final four.  Ric Flair returned to his old WCW hometown of Atlanta for his in-ring return in a Street Fight against fellow co-owner Mr. McMahon in a street fight that turned out to be bloody & aggressive between both men with Flair's family sitting in the front row to witness everything.  Other matches include WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. The Rock, Intercontinental Champion Edge vs. William Regal, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, and Tag Team Champions Spike Dudley & Tazz vs. Dudley Boyz.",1194739200,13,7362,4.659984579799537

-Vader vs. The Artist Formely Known As Goldust w/Luna Vachon: Not a bad contest here, but this was an odd time for the Goldust character and Vader was nearing the end of his WWE run. They worked good together and the end was awesome as Luna was on Vader's back but he still hit a massive Vader Bomb then covered Goldust to win the match. 6/10.

-6-Man Mini-Tag Team Match, Battallion, Tarantula & El Torito vs. Max Mini, Nova and Mosaic, Special Guest Referee, Sunny: Shockingly these midgets put on a good performance, they all hit plenty of high spots that cruiserweights usually hit. Not a bad one here as Max, Nova and Mosaic take this one. 6/10. Side note: Sunny did look very nice as a referee to say the least, problem with this match is it was a little short. Also the jokes Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler made I personally found quite funny.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, The Rock (Champion) vs. Ken Shamrock: These two always had good matches as Rock was in great heel mode at this time and Shamrock always had that great intensity where he could snap at any moment. Rock uses brass knucks and sticks them in Ken's tights, but Ken actually wins after hitting a belly to belly suplex. The ref however notices the knucks and awards Rock the match, what a swerve. 6/10. Loved the aftermath where Shamorock snapped and put the ankle lock on the ref.

-WWE Tag Team Championship Match, The New Age Outlaws (Champions) vs. The Legion of Doom: Started out good but became very average as LOD were basically jobbed to the Outlaws here especially in the end when Hawk gets handcuffed then Animal gets a steel chair shot, causing a DQ. 5/10.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Cactus Jack is #1, Chainsaw Charlie (Terry Funk) is #2, which was a fun way to start off the match. The Rock did well coming in at #4, lasting over 50 minutes and thats after he wrestled previously in the show. Mick Foley had a famed performance appearing as all three of his personas in this match. But its most remembered for Austin fighting against all odds to win his second Rumble in a row as he earns a title shot at Wrestlemania XIV. Great rumble here.

-Casket Match for the WWE Title, Shawn Michaels (Champion) vs. The Undertaker: This was one of their best encounters as Taker was in his specialty match. The action starts off fast and is back and forth, about 2 minutes in Michaels takes a backdrop on the casket that would result in a back injury that would keep him out of action for over 4 years. Taker works over Shawn with power moves, and seems to be focusing on his back. Michaels throws some powder into Taker's eyes, hits a piledriver onto the steel steps that sounded sickening. Both men end up in the casket, Shawn tries to get out but gets dragged back in horror movie style. 6 men attack Taker, Kane comes to the rescue, only to turn on his brother and lock him in the casket. Michaels retains his title in about 18 minutes. 8/10. The aftermath were Kane sets the casket on fire sparked their feud that would go into Wrestlemania.

1999

-WWE Hardcore Championship Match, The Big Bossman (Champion) vs. The Road Dogg: Should've been a hardcore rules match given how Bossman's best days were behind him and Road Dogg was always better in no rules matches. Not horrible but nothing memorable, Big Bossman ends up getting the win here in a very average match. 4/10.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Ken Shamrock (Champion) vs. Billy Gunn: After Billy had made passes at Shamrock's sister in the weeks coming up to this, Ken was out for revenge and Billy who tried his best just couldn't fight out of the ankle lock and he was forced to tap out and Shamrock retains. 5/10.

-WWE European Championship Match, X-Pac (Champion) vs. Gangrel: This one wasn't good, they didn't mesh well and only X-Pac's usual set of kicks and quick moves made this passable. X-Pac ends up hitting the X-Factor for the win. 4/10.

-Strap Match for the WWE Women's Championship, Sable (Champion) vs. Luna: Shane McMahon came out with Luna and asked Sable to surrender the title cause of her back injury, she refused and so we have this match. Its fairly one sided as Sable despite the injury dominated Luna for the most part and ended up touching all four corners and retained her title. 5/10.

-I Quit Match for the WWE Championship, Mankind (Champion) vs. The Rock: Now this was a great match, worthy of being on a greatest matches of all time list in my opinion. Hard hitting, Mankind takes all kinds of brutal hits and falls as does the Rock. Mankind's fall onto a switchboard looked like it hurt as did the multiple chair shots Rock gave Mankind while he was handcuffed. Rock beats him with a chair into the aisleway and then finally got Mankind to ""say"" I quit, though it was clearly obvious it was audio played over the loudspeaker, that being said Rock was awarded the title. 10/10.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin is #1, Vince McMahon is #2 and the opening and closing minutes where Austin gets his hands on Vince and beats him down were the best parts of the match. The rest was not very good or well booked there aren't any standout performances and it never seems to get out of first gear outside of the Vince/Austin confrontations. The Rock comes down and distracts Austin allowing Vince to toss him over the top rope and Vince off all people wins the Rumble. Not a very good one here.

2000

-Kurt Angle vs. Tazz: Nice pre-match promo by Angle where even in his early days he was a cocky son of a.... well you get the idea. I do love how the New York crowd was already chanting ""We Want Tazz"" before he even came out and boy did they pop when he appeared. The match quickly goes to the outside where Angle suplexes Tazz onto the concrete on the outside. Tazz hits a few nice suplexes of his own then locks on the Tazzmission and Angle passes out, so Tazz wins. 6/10, cause it was so short.

-Tag Team Table Match, The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz: Good promo by Buh Buh Ray where he praises infamous MLB pitcher John Rocker, which at this time was pretty topical and funny to me. Now this is a good tag team match, plenty of good spots, Jeff takes a nasty bump when a table gets thrown into his face by Buh Buh. Even a ladder and chairs are brought in which spice up the match. Matt and Jeff put Buh Buh through a table after Matt dives from a ladder and Jeff dives from the top rope. Jeff tries a suicide dive but smashes through a table, Matt gets powerbombed by the Dudleys through a table. The finish is nice as Jeff hits a big swanton on Devon through a table. Great match, 9/10.

-Miss Rumble Swimsuit Competition: Entrants include Terri Runnels, Jacqueline, Ivory, B.B., Luna Vachon and The Kat. This is pretty lame honestly, though King is entertaining at times. The end where Mae Young enters the contest is quite a gut wrenching and sick moment to say the least as she gets exposed, so yeah, ack!!

-Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental Championship, Chyna (Co-Champion) vs. Chris Jericho (Co-Champion) vs. Hardcore Holly: Despite the co-champion storyline this wasn't a bad match but Chyna didn't have any business being any kind of men's singles champion beyond maybe a month (not 3 months like she had been) even at this time in her career. Chyna does almost have the match won as she hits the pedigree on Holly. Jericho hits the bulldog on Chyna and the lionsault, makes the pin and becomes the undisputed I.C. champion. 6/10.

-Tag Team Championship Match, New Age Outlaws (Champions) vs. The Acolytes: Bradshaw and Faarooq take it to the outlaws and almost have the titles when X-Pac interferes allowing Billy Gunn to hit the fame-asser on Bradshaw and covering him to retain the titles. Not bad just over too quick. 5/10.

-Street Fight for the WWE Championship, Triple H (Champion) vs. Cactus Jack: The build-up for this was very intense and felt quite real and this match lived up to and surpassed it. Cactus brought his A-game and Trips did elevate his game (no pun intended) as he hung with Foley and took a hell of a beating while dishing one out. Trips takes a suplex onto a wooden palet and a piece of it stabs him in the leg. Foley gets cuffed and beaten with a chair out into the aisle way before the Rock comes in for the save. Foley gets back dropped into some tacks, then pedigreed but he kicks out. Trips hits another pedigree into the tacks and covers Cactus for the win to retain his title. Best match of the night, one of the best title matches I've seen. 10/10.

-The Royal Rumble Match is here, first we see a flashback to '95's Rumble where Shawn Michaels won after entering #1. As for this match, D'Lo Brown is #1 and Grandmaster Sexay is #2, there is a nice spot where Too Cool members Sexay, Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi dance during the rumble only to have Rikishi eliminate his friends. There's also a nice face/off between Rikishi and Viscera. There are some people who already competed earlier that are in the rumble like Holly, Chyna, Jericho, The Outlaws and the Acolytes. Suprisingly Bob Backlund enters the rumble which stunned the crowd. There is the expected showdown with The Rock and Big Show and it comes down to those two where Show goes to throw Rock over but Rock holds onto the ropes and Show goes over the top rope to the floor and The Rock is going to Wrestlemania. Not a bad match, just kinda dead in parts.

2001

-WWE Tag Team Championship Match, Edge & Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz: Recently E&C had used the con-chair-to on both Dudley's,so Bubba & D'Von weren't 100% coming into this match. They were noticeably off due to selling said injuries, but it was a good match that saw The Dudley's get the win to become the new tag team champions. 7/10.

-Ladder Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, Chris Benoit (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho: This was a hell of a championship match, both men worked so well together whether it was as partners or as opponents. There were plenty of good spots, including Benoit doing a suicide dive but getting a vicious chair shot for his troubles. There was also good submission wrestling as Benoit worked on Jericho's arm, but he came back applying a submission on top of the ladder to Benoit. Jericho knocked the ladder over and Benoit hit the ropes and fell to the outside, Jericho climbed to the top and grabbed the title to become the new I.C. champion. 9/10.

-WWE Women's Championship Match, Ivory (Champion) vs. Chyna: A bit before this, Chyna had suffered a neck injury thanks to Ivory and the Right to Censor. Coming into this match there was the question of if she came back too soon, but she said she was healthy. Chyna does dominate early and often, but when she goes for a handspring elbow the back of her head hits the turnbuckle and she's down. Ivory makes the cover to retain her title, in what was a pretty bad match honestly. 3/10.

-WWE Championship Match, Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Triple H: Very underated and forgotten title match during Kurt's first championship run, as these two exchanged wrestling holds, brawling and momentum a few times during the match. There was also the underlying rivalry involving both Trish and Stephanie which after they started fighting Vince came out to separate them. Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered nailing Triple H with a chair and hitting the stunner allowing Kurt to make the cover and retain his title. 9/10. Side note Austin's interference was the result of Triple H preventing Austin from winning the title a few weeks prior on Raw.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Jeff Hardy is #1, Bull Buchanan is #2, this was a very good Rumble mainly remembered for Drew Carey's appearance, Kane's 1 hour running time where he threw out 11 men, Big Show's shocking return and the destruction he caused and for Stone Cold fighting back from a blind side attack by Triple H during his entrance and he was able to win after nailing Kane with 3 chair shots and a stunner and tossing Kane over the top and Austin is going to Wrestlemania. I also loved the hardcore portion of this match as the action was just great.

2002

Tag Team Championship Match, Tazz & Spike Dudley (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz: This is a decent opening tag match that got the crowd fired up. The Dudley's target Spike's neck and keep him in the ring and beat him up. Once Tazz gets tagged he suplexes both Dudley's and slaps the Tazzmission on Stacy from the ring apron. Soon after he locks it on D'Von who taps out and Tazz and Spike retain. 6/10.

-Lillian Garcia is backstage with Edge and he talks about how he can get just as rough as William Regal can.

-Intercontinental Championship Match, William Regal vs. Edge (Champion): These two had quite a rivalry in late '01 into Feb. of '02 and this was a good match but their styles don't always mix well. Edge does take it to Regal and almost has the I.C. title in his hands but Regal ends up pulling out a win thanks to a well timed brass knuckles shot, while the ref was down. New I.C. champion, William Regal. 6/10.

-WWE Women's Championship Match, Trish Stratus (Champion) vs. Jazz, w/special referee Jacqueline: Trish had an injured hand coming into tonight and this was a quick match here where Jazz uses her strength advantage, but Trish keeps at it and hits a running bulldog and makes the cover to retain her title. 4/10.

-Street Fight, Ric Flair vs. Mr. McMahon: Its Flair's first match in almost a year since the closing of WCW in March of '01 and while not great its always good to see Ric in the ring. Vince gets chopped by Flair quite a bit and Vince does bust Ric open and beats him up for a bit even in front of his family who is at ringside. Flair makes his comeback and locks on the figure four leg lock and McMahon taps out as Ric wins. 8/10.

-Undisputed Championship Match, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. The Rock: Great title match here, Jericho was out to prove he deserved to be the champion and Rock wanted one more run with the title. The tide kept shifting between the two men and Jericho did hold his own against ""The People's Champ"". There were a couple of ref bumps including Rock giving the Rock Bottom to former WCW ref Nick Patrick, then hits the People's elbow but there's no ref to make the count. Jericho hit a low blow, slams Rock's head into the exposed turnbuckle then rolls him up using the ropes to win the match and retain the title. 9/10.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Rikishi is #1 and the returning Goldust is #2, interesting way to start out to say the least. Bradshaw enters soon after and nails Lance Storm with a massive Clothesline From Hell in a great spot. The Undertaker enters at #8 and clears everyone out of the ring, then both Hardy's are #9 and 10, but they get tossed out quickly. Tough Enough rookie Maven shocks the world at #11 by eliminating Undertaker but Maven quickly gets taken to the outside and nailed with a chair.

-It slows down here until Stone Cold comes in, then a bit after Triple H comes in and after this the match picks up and stays at a great pace. Austin gets elimanted in a suprise move and Mr. Perfect shines here as he's in the final three. It comes down to Triple H and Kurt Angle and just when Angle thinks he has it won, Triple H comes back nailing Kurt and tossing him over the top rope to win the Rumble and go on to Wrestlemania. Great beginning and end to this Rumble.",1314921600,2,15364,4.510064701653486

This had one of the best ppv intros of all time. So did the 1996, 2003 (but the music they used in the original ppv was better) & 2005 (THANK GOD that Hollywood part of the intro was cut) editions which I forgot the mention in those reviews.

Vader vs Goldust - Innovative finish for Vader.

Shamrock vs Rock (I.C. Title) - Liked it. These two had chemistry.

LOD vs Outlaws (tag Titles - Same comment as the I.C Title. I understand The Outlaws needed to look really good here. But being a LOD fan, I didn't like how LOD looked here though.

The Rumble match: Memorable moments for me: Cactus/Chainsaw and eventually Rock starting out, Kurrgan's dominance, Foley appearing 3 different times, the way Austin entered (from behind as he was a marked man), Austin/Rock face off, JR & King's commentary, especially JR, ""Stone Cold! Stone Cold! Stone Cold is going to WM!"" line

Tyson interview: Was happy Austin won. Revealed he was a UT fan for many years. Funny how he said Cold Stone lol.

Taker vs HBK (Casket Match for the WWF Title) - LOVED this match. These two really gelled together. I know WWE is working on a Stone Cold-Rock Rivalry DVD. But the Taker-HBK rivalry should be one of the next Rivalry DVD's. Again, UT clearly should have won & would have had they not re-did the 1994 angle except with less men. This time however, Kane made a memorable entrance & cleared the ring before attacking Taker allowing HBK to win.

Other memorable moments: Taker's entrance (HBK high tailed out of the ring once Taker raised the lights), the counters, the piledriver on the steps, HBK's elbow into the casket, Taker dragging HBK ""back down into the depths Of Hell"" as JR said, Taker's Chokeslam & the Tombstone into the casket, Kane burning the casket, JR's memorable line - ""And my God! The casket's on fire! The casket is on fire! The UT is in the casket!""

Royal Rumble 1999

Road Dogg vs Bossman - Good. But would've been better as a Hardcore Match for the freedom they'd have.

Billy Gunn vs Shamrock - Good match.

X-Pac vs Gangrel - I liked this one. I like King's ""This guy is weeiiirrd"" line after Gangrel spits red liquid into the crowd (I thin it hit or almost hit a guy in the front row)

Sable vs Luna (Women's Title) - Skip this.

Mankind Vs. The Rock (I Quit match for the WWF Title) - I think this was WWF's first I Quit match. Many think that Bret vs Austin from Wm13 was. But that was a Submission Match. Here, Foley took multiple unprotected chair shots!

Rumble Match - This was a real screwed up Rumble lol. But it did have its moments. Kane's dominance, Austin & Vince, certain guys trying to collect the $1000 bounty by eliminating Austin, and King's hilarious response to Vince winning.

Royal Rumble 2000

Tazz vs Kurt Angle - Tazz turned out to be Kurt's mystery opponent. Decent debut for him. Too bad he didn't really get anywhere after this night.

Hardyz vs Dudleys (Tables match) - Without a doubt, ties with the WWF Title match in terms of being the Match Of The Night & a Show-Stealer. To win, both members of a team had to be out through tables. Great table spots here. Too many to put. Jeff Hardy was the MVP.

Chyna vs Jericho vs Hardcore Holly (Triple Threat I.C. Title match - Chyna & Jericho were co-champions. It was a good match. Not a fan of women vs men because it's men who always win, implying women cannot be successful in sports when competing against men which isn't true IMO. Anyway, Jericho wins here. I was cheering for him so I was happy.

Acolytes vs Outlaws (Tag Titles) - I've seen better tag matches.

Cactua Jack vs HHH (Street Fight for the WWF Title) - Words can't explain this. Gotta watch for yourself. The transformation on SD Mick made from Mankind to Cactus Jack was quite a moment& the priceless look on HHH's face made that segment even more memorable.

The Rumble match itself wasn't one of my favorites. But I've seen worse ones & so this one was pretty decent. I was cheering Kane after witnessing his dominance in the 1999 edition. But he didn't win.

Royal Rumble 2001

Dudleys vs E&C (Tag Titles) - E&C made this match for me because as great a team as The Dudleys are, just couldn't get into them unless it's a Tables or TLC match.

Jericho vs Benoit (Ladder match for I.C. Title) - Match Of The Night IMO. Enough said.

Chyna vs Ivory (Women's Title)

HHH vs Angle (WWF Title) - Stephanie was in her husband's corner while Trish was in her business partner's corner. Angle won thanks to Austin of all people.

The Rumble match was great. Loved The Hardys facing each other. Then Drew Carey came in. Never liked him. And he didn't belong here. It's because of him being in the ring that The Hardys had a stupid exit from the match. But Kane came & I'll give him credit here because Drew was priceless. Kane OWNED this match to the point of where he should've won it. Rock & Austin had their Rumble nights. This should have been Kane's (well it was, but sealed with a win). Taker had a good showing before being eliminated by Rikishi. Rock & Austin had another face off.

Royal Rumble 2002

Spike Dudley/TAZZ VS. The Dudley Boyz w/Stacy Kiebler (WWF/WWE Tag Team Championship) - While I have seen better tag title matches in my time, this wasn't bad by any means.

Edge Vs. William Regal (WWF/WWE I-C Title Match) - Regal is a tremendous worker. But I could never get into his style which made me not like this match despite the wok rate of him & Edge.

Trish Stratus Vs. Jazz (WWF/WWE Women's Title Match) - Always a fan of Trish as a wrestler. This was good.

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Vince McMahon (Streetfight Match) - Don't endorse Flair wrestling.

Chris Jericho Vs. The Rock (WWF/WWE Undisputed Championship Match) - Great match just like their matches from Vengeance, No Mercy & RAW in late 2001.

The Royal Rumble Match - I liked this match. It was the returns of Goldust, Venis, Godfather and Mr. Perfect. Kane eliminating Big Show via bodyslam is an impressive feat. Wish Kane lasted longer though. Taker's run, though short, was a dominant one before his elimination by a rookie who is pretty much off the radar these days. I feel they screwed Taker over in 2002 and some parts of 2003 by having him lose to guys like Maven & Brock because they didn't deserve to beat him, didn't last long in WWE & in Maven's case, didn't deserve to be on the WWE roster period.
HHH, not surprisingly won this.",1310256000,,6396,4.470335339638865
