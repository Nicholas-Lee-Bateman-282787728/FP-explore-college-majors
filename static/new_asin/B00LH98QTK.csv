6486766,3,B00LH98QTK,Difficult to think of Nataniel Parker as our French Canadian Inspector Armand Gamache. Couldn't they have gotten a Canadian to play the main role?,1408924800,20,146,5.125
6486767,5,B00LH98QTK,"Have just bought my second copy of this book.  First read it years ago and have been a devoted Louise Penny reader ever since.  Have read all of her Three Pines Books and highly recommend all of them.  With each book the authors writing style has developed so well.  Lost track of this first book, just got my second copy and plan to read it again.  Along with a small circle of family and friend we eagerly await each new book in this fine series.  We talk about the characters in the stories as if they to are family and long time friends.  Good writing, interesting plots, wonderful characters.  So nice to have Three Pines Village to visit every two years.  Hope the TV Series will not disappoint.  Hard for me to imagine Inspector Linley as Chief Inspector Gamache.
Wish we in the US could get the books the same time as in Canada !",1408233600,20,837,4.341935483870968
6486768,1,B00LH98QTK,Too bad there aren't negative stars for this mess.  Some nit decided to do a parody of Inspector Lynley Mysteries without understanding the brilliance of Monty Python.  Mr. Parker does his best amongst a cast of super fools who wouldn't be cast in your local civic theatre.  Total waste of time.,1530316800,,295,4.745098039215686

6486774,1,B00LH98QTK,Truly an awful movie. 90 minutes Im not getting back. the story was weak. THe acting was terrible. Im grateful that I never read the book so this movie couldn't ruin it for me. He one good point is the cinematography. Great scenery.,1528848000,,232,4.4186046511627906

6486777,5,B00LH98QTK,"I'm rating the movie five stars because I loved the scenery and visual rendering of Three Pines.  I viewed it with my sister who was not familiar with the series and she loved the movie.  As for me, I was disappointed in some of the casting, especially that of Myrna who, in the book, is described as a wise, knowledgable, obese black woman.  I understand that not everything in the book could be included but I did miss the book character of Myrna.",1527984000,,449,4.385542168674699

6486779,1,B00LH98QTK,"As a lover of Pennys books, I was so thrilled to see that this one had become a film - what a disappointment! First, miscasting of just about every character - love Nathaniel Parker, but not here. Hes not Gamache - too tall, too handsome, too thin, too self-assured. Clara - too pretty, too polished - not the messy, older, delightful woman in the books. Peter looks like a male model, and the film implies something between Gamache and Clara thats simply not there - Gamache loves his wife very much - and shes a big help in the mysteries -  but we don't even know she exists till the end. But the biggest problem to me: Myrna. You have this black woman in the film whos always there, never identified, just sort of token at every dinner and gathering - never identified, never speaks. Its a crime to do this in a film. Myrna is a real character, an important one, in the books - this film is just plain racist in its treatment of her. My guess is that the actress is embarrassed about this film. Louise Penny should be. I am.",1527465600,,1027,4.293814432989691
6486780,5,B00LH98QTK,"I'm a fan of Nathaniel Parker from the
Lynley Mystery series. He was excellent as the inspector in Still Life. I hope they film more of Louise Penny's series.",1527120000,,158,4.482758620689655
6486781,4,B00LH98QTK,"I like the movie but not the casting of the women. All the women are too good looking, too young, too slender, or too nice or all of these. The most egregious are Myrna and Ruth. Myrna is the wiccan psychologist, who in Penny's books is fat and wears large and colorful clothing. The problem with Ruth, the grumpy old and famous poet, is that she is scripted to be far nicer and sociable than in the books. This is a problem because it plays against the depth of the character and makes her less compelling.
It looks like the same old problem in the movie industry: sexism.",1525651200,,573,4.314814814814815
6486782,2,B00LH98QTK,It was not as good as the book.  Characters were not as strong.,1525046400,,63,3.8461538461538463
6486783,3,B00LH98QTK,Some of the characters are not like the book. Still an enjoyable and scenic movie.,1524096000,,82,4.533333333333333
6486784,4,B00LH98QTK,"Very solid mystery with a good cast and quality acting.  I'm aware of some negative reviews, but I often feel those speak more to the reviewer than the film and it certainly applies here.  Those who love the book, I'm sure will find fault because no film adaptation can ever fully capture the written book because it lacks the one thing that no amount of effort or special effects can replace: the ability of the human mind to flesh out the characters and locations from our own imagination!  That is an unfair standard to hold films to.  We must recognize the limitations of the medium and judge it based upon how it made use of what it has to work with.  This movie succeeds.",1523232000,,677,4.42741935483871

6486786,5,B00LH98QTK,The video brought the people in the book to life in a way I had not expected. It was an adaptation unusually well done in my opinion.  I am now hoping and praying this is the first of many.  (I have read all 12 books in the series so far.),1522195200,,239,3.76
6486787,4,B00LH98QTK,Good story line.. the scenery was beautiful...they could make 10 more.. follow the whole book series..,1521072000,,102,5.4375
6486788,1,B00LH98QTK,"Disappointing. Poorly cast and therefore poorly acted. Flat, cardboard depictions of characters that come to life in the books. The setting did not measure up to the quaint, idyllic village described in the books. It should have been filmed in northern California or New England. The musical score was not harmonic with the scenes; there was no tension in either. Clara was not supposed to be pretty and Myrna, a key character in the books, is supposed to be a large woman who has a name and the ability to speak! She wasn't even introduced or addressed in the film. Horrid movie.",1520035200,,580,4.696078431372549

6486818,5,B00LH98QTK,"I loved it.  I did not know that what has become my favorite ever story and author, was actually on film.  I searched on a lark and found ""Still Life"" on film and ordered immediately.  I watched everyday for it to arrive.  I am hoping there will be a film of the other novels. Meeting Louise Penny and talking with her is at the TOP of my bucket list.  I want to live in Three Pines!  The casting and setting for the film are perfect! Wonderful in fact!  I have watched the dvd several times.  I would love to visit the beautiful town where it was filmed and immerse myself in the come to real life of my  novels.  I have read every one of them at this point  Canada is a beautiful country and the Canadians are the friendliest people on earth.  I have lived all of my 68 years on the Gulf Coast of Florida..  I taught middle school children English and American history for thirty years, but am retired now. Many people think Florida is paradise.  Maybe, but the rural areas of Canada are what is left of God's original creation, and have to be the most beautiful and peaceful areas on earth.",1508025600,3,1093,4.242718446601942

6486822,2,B00LH98QTK,"This story had great potential, especially with Nathaniel Parker in the lead role. Unfortunately, the plot was fragmented and somewhat incoherent. Great setting for a ""cozy"" mystery, but leaves you feeling disappointed.",1505174400,,219,5.875

6486825,3,B00LH98QTK,Agree with the other reviewers that the movie was a bit of a disappointment.  It's hard for me to think of Nathaniel Parker as anyone other than Thomas Lynley.,1504828800,,159,4.482758620689655
6486826,3,B00LH98QTK,"This would be reasonably entertaining for anyone who's never read Louise Penny's books. However, I found it to be a disappointment on so many levels. The plot was more or less true to the book, but the most important aspects, the things that make her books so appealing, were all completely missing, and the result is a fairly shallow story. Three Pines is a village with an almost magical quality. The characters and the village are inextricably connected, and that connection is part of what makes the books so enjoyable. There was absolutely no character development in the adaptation, and with the possible exception of the portrayal of Ruth Zardo, the roles were miscast. Nathaniel Parker apparently did his best, but he's not quite right for the part of Inspector Gamache. I hope that if there are any plans to continue with the series, they'll film in a different location with better casting and try to portray Three Pines as the magical French Canadian village that Ms. Penny created.",1504742400,7,993,4.881656804733728

6486828,1,B00LH98QTK,I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Was Parker blackmailed into doing this? or did he owe someone a really big favor.,1503619200,,123,4.391304347826087

6486831,3,B00LH98QTK,"Nathaniel Parker is such a great actor- I thought SURELY these poorer reviews were not giving enough credit to this show. They are terribly correct, though. The acting is incredibly poor- it reminds me of those after-school shows that came on in the early nineties for teens. I have never read the books but, the story presented just doesn't seem to mesh and flow very well. It seemed like they were attempting to make it a little ""Poirot-ish"" but it just failed at making it out of the gate.",1502409600,2,492,4.53932584269663
6486832,4,B00LH98QTK,"Set in the bucolic village of Three Pines, ""Still Life"" is a film adaptation of Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny's award-winning first novel, featuring Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Suret de Qubec. Jane Neal (Bronwen Mantel) is found dead in the woods Sunday morning, the victim of an archer whose arrow went right through her. Gamache (Nathaniel Parker) and his team -Inspector Jean-Guy Beauvoir (Anthony Lemke) and the inexperienced Inspector Yvette Nichol (Susanna Fournier)- investigate. Gamache learns from cantankerous poet Ruth Zardo (Deborah Grover) that Jane called out some gay-bashing youths on Friday morning. On Friday afternoon, Jane entered a painting in a local competition, according to best friend Clara Morrow (Kate Hewlett). On Friday evening, Jane invited her friends to a party in her living room, which none had ever seen. Uncultured bow hunter Matthew Croft (Kent McQuaid) makes himself a conspicuous suspect, as does Jane's greedy niece Yoland (Jayne Heitmeyer), but the painting and secret living room beg for investigation.

Although ""Still Life"" takes place in Qubec, it is a quintessential English village mystery. It features a large cast of suspects and supporting characters, a death by unusual means, a picturesque village, an authoritative and steadfastly moral detective, and it's a little corny. The characterizations of the supporting cast are a cut above ""Midsomer Murders"" but not quite ""Miss Marple"". Chief Inspector Gamache is handsome, warm, well-mannered, and charmingly ""old school"" next to Inspector Beauvoir. He's an appealing character, highly functional except perhaps for his acrophobia, which is played for laughs, not taken seriously- unlike a lot of recent British detectives. Nathaniel Parker suits this role well. There has been some complaint about the casting by fans of Louise Penny's novels. I haven't read the books so I can only compare this movie to other onscreen English village mysteries, and it compares favorably. The setting is pleasant, the characters' enjoyment of food and art are characteristically French, and the mystery is what I expect from this genre.",1502323200,,2139,5.4818181818181815

Actually, I'm surprised he agreed to take such a role.  I thought the writing - the dialog - was particularly awful - and the plot unfolded without creating any rising interest or suspense.  Most of the acting was mediocre.  Not sure if a number of the actors were British actors - aside from Parker that is - but some of the North American accents seemed exaggerated to me.  I thought the character and the actor of the errant, know it all, policewoman was the worst, and the villain/murderer - (without spoilers here) - was lame.

I do wish the movie had spent a less time on the early false lead story and spent a lot more time with the other town' characters. They're interesting enough to warrant a richer part in the movie, and flashbacks just always seem to feel a bit flat.",1495238400,,553,4.326923076923077

Clara is too young also  The real Clara is a messy artist. Yes, Myrna  is black, but VERY LARGE.  Jean Guy is French as are Gabi and Olivier and of course Armand. .  Even the English characters have no trace of a Canadian English accent.
Last but not least, Ruth Zardo.  She is played by an older actress as she should be, but one with no spunk or attitude.  And where is Rosa?

A film adaptation would have a difficult time capturing the books, but I thought this did a reasonable job for what it was, and would watch another.  I agree with many of the comments: that the deep sense of place that Penny brings to Three Pines is essentially ignored, and that is a shame.  Even the bistro is claustrophobic and not at all a measure of the welcoming and spacious bistro of the books.  Myrna looks nothing like the Myrna of the books, and Myrna's appearance is an integral part of her character.  But I thought Gamache was well done.  I am not overly familiar with Parker's previous works as Lynly, and so am not prejudiced by that.

Nathaniel Parker is usually such a good actor but he really seemed like a cardboard cut out.version of our beloved Inspector. There was none of the kindness, the internal struggle, the relationship with his wife. Jean-Guy and Nichol were more cardboard versions with none of the depth of character we could have expected and certainly none of their motivation for their behavior. Neither actor seemed at all in tune with their role and Nichol's brashness and rude behavior just seemed badly played and forced. I was expecting a much more acerbic Ruth, Clara and Peter were miscast but at least the actress who played Clara did her best with an appalling script. What happened to Myrna? She was completely sidelined. And poor Reine-Marie, tagged on at the end in a completely false and forced way. This could have been so much better - the scriptwriter failed so badly to capture the essence of any of the human characters or even Three Pines itself.

6486920,4,B00LH98QTK,"I enjoyed this but like other veteran readers of all of the books, I felt that it came up short.  The most basic problem this had was that it deviated from the visuals put in the readers' heads over 10+ novels. The novels are extremely descriptive.  The mystery itself is handled fine. It is letter perfect with the book. Here are the things which jar with the novels:

1) the tv version is not noticeably set in Quebec, Canada. The novels make much of this. The characters are nothing like Americans or UKers. Besides, they all speak French 24/7. So changing this to English language with an all American and British cast, speaking primarily American English, interfered with my ability to believe in them.
2) most have substantially upgraded in physical appearance. This interferes with the character development. Clara, for one, is supposed to look like an unmade bed most of the time, not look like a Miss America winner. Myrna is supposed to very overweight. Gamache is not supposed to be handsome. His second in command is not supposed to be a hunk.  Yet those are the descriptions fitting the tv actors here. The one that is the most off is Clara, which is a shame because she is the heart of the books. Her rag tag artist way of always being at sixes and sevens is very charming in the novels.
3) Ruth Zardo, the poet, looks correct but her language is entirely clean. Ruth normally is a walking, talking obscenity and profanity stream of consciousness so this too is totally off. There must be some swear words allowed on these shows. I hear them on others. Even using toned down swear words would have been something, like maybe a screw you. But, no, there is nothing.
4) The mystique of the village of Three Pines is considerable in the novels. That ambiance needed to be developed for tv too. It was not. It could have been a small town anywhere in America with nothing very unusual about it. In the novels, the ambiance of the village is so strong that you want to live there, despite its having brutal weather and substandard internet service.

This is the only episode I could find, on acorn tv. so maybe this version didn't fly long range. perhaps there will be another version. I can't say they did a terrible job here. They didn't. It was a typically well done UK production. But this is a very special series and it needs more.",1481155200,,2346,4.549763033175355

And while the characters did not ""come to life"", at least I was able to savor a bit of the Three Pines that is so beloved in the novels.

For the most part the characters were true to those I have grown to love via Ms Penny's writing. It would be nice to bring in a bit more of the French culture, and language, not that I speak it, but it would feel a bit more like Three Pines.
  These are early days, I'm willing to give N. Parker a chance to break into the shoes of Gamache. The Inspector is an unusual man. The atmosphere of the village, and it's isolation from so much of the modern technology and crowds and noise of today, is missing. Three Pines will be better defined in future film projects I hope. None the less, I look forward to the entire series being brought to to screen.

The negative reviews are unfair.  Parker nails the roll, as do many of the other characters.  It is unfair to think a 90 minute movie is going to develop the characters the readers know from the 13 books.  Frankly I think the movie is great, and it's a shame people judged it so harshly, it would have made a great series.

It kind of reminds me of how many people were upset with John Thaw as Morse because he was not like the character in the books, yet today Thaw is Morse.  Fortunately the internet wasn't  around in the 80's to allow every tom/dick/or Harriet to smear the first Morse the way Still Life got smeared",1473292800,2,691,4.310077519379845

Yes, many of the characters did not fit the appearances I had concocted in my mind from the book (and many of them were, I believe, younger than the characters of the book) -- but the actors nailed the souls of the characters and warmth of Three Pines.  Of course, time does not permit a movie to give you every nuance of a book.  However, unlike many adaptations, the movie contains all of the important plot elements,  I thought the photography set the scene perfectly and the interactions between the characters were wonderful.

The actors that played Peter and Clara did not fit the description from the books at all.

While she made Three Pines seem a lot like Brigadoon, in reality I knew while reading the story that any town can look majestic depending on the context and the person that is looking, therefore I thought they did a great job with this small hamlet in this film. While I was certainly disappointed with how much had to be left out, I thought it was a decent adaptation of the book. Many characters had no screen time at all, which left a great deal of the story out unfortunately, which left out the richness of the entire story that Penny created. This was a very abridged version of the original book. Overall I think the actors did well in their portrayals of each. I envisioned many of them a bit older though so that was kind of weird. I think in all it was a great job. I certainly want to go to where ever they filmed this, however it's hard to imagine it is outside Montreal. I live 2 hours south of Montreal and it's very flat up there. I haven't seen all of the areas though so I guess this is plausible.",1448668800,2,1154,4.273972602739726

I liked the film version of Clara even better than her description in the novels.  She is truly wonderful!  Gamache's wife Reine-Marie does enter at the end, but a sense of her presence via Gamache's thoughts pervades the book, and it might have been nice to meet her earlier in some way.

6487114,4,B00LH98QTK,"Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sret du Qubec and his team are called in to the scene of a suspicious death in a rural village south of Montral and yet a world away. A long-time resident of Three Pines has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it's a tragic hunting accident but Gamache smells something foul this holiday season

Canadian author Louise Penny, who'd previously grabbed notice via the CWA Debut Dagger, which recognises outstanding unpublished crime writers, made a real splash in the crime fiction world with her subsequent debut novel, STILL LIFE (St Martins, 2005). That award-hoarding debut (it won Dagger, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Anthony, and Dilys Awards) introduces engaging French-Canadian detective Armand Gamache and his team, and launched a popular series that catapulted Penny into the upper echelons of the genre.

I've heard good things about Penny's writing for years, and have several of her Gamache books on my TBR bookcases, but must embarrassingly confess I haven't yet read them. So when I stumbled upon the recent television adaptation of STILL LIFE on British television this week, I was keen to give it a watch.

The Canadian production has a very British rather than American feel to it, other than several accents, which seem a strange mix of American rather than French-Canadian, with some British ones thrown in. As an aside, at first I was a little put off by Chief Inspector Armande Gamache speaking with a very posh British accent, which rang false to me (having not read the books), but this is explained well a little later.

In a way the television production reminded me a lot of Midsomer Murders in style and cinematography as well as pacing and storytelling. There's a definite 'classic British cosy' vibe, just in a Quebec setting, which I actually really enjoyed. Almost like a modern Murder, She Wrote, but in Canada. There's something comfortingly familiar and enjoyable about that tone and atmosphere; it's certainly a refreshing change from the quick-cutting, glossy, forensic-heavy crime shows that dominate TV channels nowadays.

Gamache and his team are called to Three Pines, a quaint rural village near Montreal populated by artistic, outdoorsy and carefree types who live a different kind of life to the big city. When the body of a beloved villager is found shot dead in the woods, no one wants to believe it's anything other than a tragic accident. But there are plenty of puzzling aspects, and the reactions of some in the victim's circle are suspicious.

Louise Penny and Nathaniel Parker
(Armande Gamache) on set
Once I got past the accent, I really enjoyed British actor Nathaniel Parker's performance as Armand Gamache, as well as the interactions between his team as the stresses of the case unfold. Inspector Jean-Guy Beauvoir (Anthony Lemke) and Inspector Yvette Nichol are both very intriguing foils, particular the latter, with her abrupt manner and inability to see past her own conclusions, which nevertheless can be correct.

The mystery itself unfolds largely as any fan of classic cosies would expect - clues point in different directions, there are suspects who seem like the culprit before being discarded, we're left wondering what has really gone on or whether our heroic cops will come to the right conclusions (if we've already got ahead of them in some ways). I liked the incorporation of both artistic and hunting aspects of the rural life into the tale, and felt that the setting and the wider cast of characters were all pretty interesting and nicely evoked.

Overall this is a good television film, nicely enjoyable, without being in any way groundbreaking or 'wow'. I would certainly watch more TV adaptations of Penny's novels, and it has underlined for me that I really should read some of her books themselves. In particular, Gamache and his team offer a lot of intriguing possibilities, in terms of character development along the course of a series. I liked the languid pace, the way things unfolded, rather than being rushed, and particularly the 'old-school' investigation that involved more deductions by the detectives than some modern cop shows that just follow the evidence.

If you like modern takes on the classic murder mystery formula, Still Life is a very nice way to spend an hour and a half or so of your time.

6487127,2,B00LH98QTK,"I love the this series of books by Louise Penney and I was so excited to learn that there was to be a Canadian production of Still Life: A Three Pines Mystery. Sadly, I was very disappointed.

Badly cast and with wooden dialogue, there was no ""life"" to this production. Gamache is French Canadian. Are you telling me that in all of Canada there wasn't one French Canadian Actor who fit the part? Or at least some guy, who looked the part and could actually act?

And Clara! I understand that quite often that the character you see in your minds eye won't match up with the person cast in a movie of the same book, but, holy cow! Did that woman even read the book? Nothing about the movie character seemed to me to be anything like the Clara from the book.

The actor playing Mryna does not look like she is described in the book. I could go on and on about the poor casting, but I think you get the idea.

Quebec is beautiful. I wish there was a 3 pines. I would love to visit and stay at the B and B. The setting could have been explored more in this movie as well, but I liked what we were shown.

The story is still solid. Louise Penney's stories and her characters are engaging.  That is the best I can say for this dramatization.  I'd love to see this series redone by a better company. Someone suggested a BBC production. How great might that be?",1442102400,,1352,4.196911196911197

6487131,5,B00LH98QTK,"Like many other reviewers, I am a fan of Louise Penny and have read all of her Gamache books. I loved the scenery in the movie- so beautiful. I think the last shot of the three pines does attempt to portray the other worldliness of the town - the spirit of the place. I also thought the inn was exactly as I had pictured it and I felt the same warm feeling that the books portray. I like Nathaniel Parker in anything he does. In this film, he doesn't have  Gamache's 'genius behind the facade' down pat yet and he's not how I pictured the character, but I hope he gets the time to feel out the character in other films of these books. Louise Penny, in the features, seems satisfied with all the actors, so who are we to complain. As others have said, I hope that they will make more of these. I would love to have every one.",1441843200,5,824,4.118012422360248
6487132,4,B00LH98QTK,The movie followed the book very well.  Louise Penny is such a wonderful writer and she adds so much descriptive prose about the setting and about the characters.  Much of this was not conveyed in the film.  I enjoyed watching the film,1441670400,,235,4.5476190476190474

Th Jean-Guy actor was good as well and the Ruth OK. But Lacoste came off as a green newbie instead of #3 on Gamache's team! The  movie did not show how wonderful the residents of Three Pines are- instead, most came off as slightly deranged or worse, plain nuts. And what about the glamour puss playing Myrna! No way! I don't know - or care - where the movie was filmed but it looked like a drab town as opposed to a charming, mystical, magical, friendly quaint village. Ugh. This movie was bad. Do not waste your time with this bomb! Stick to Louise Penny's fabulous Gamache books and use your imagination for the rest!",1439078400,,763,4.489208633093525

Nathaniel Parker is great as Detective Lynley, but he did not fit my mental image of Armand Gamache.  Clara was not as disorganized and flighty as in the book, and even Ruth was watered down from the outrageous and even nasty character she is.  Even though I read the book, the movie still seemed confusing in places.  I think in the case of this series of mysteries, it is better to read the book than watch a movie.",1438992000,,525,4.21

6487156,2,B00LH98QTK,Beautiful scenery but terrible interpretation of the book and poor casting for the characters. Where were the Fracophones?  Inspector Gamache constantly switched from French to English. I guess that special and main  personality trait couldn't be considered. The plot didn't bring out the special connection all the characters have with one another. Ruth Zardo comes across as mean instead of eccentric but loveable.

Certain things like this fear of snakes when Canada has no poisonous snakes to speak of and garter snakes are nothing to be afraid of is just plain silly. Louise Penny is glorified in Canada all the time but this is just horrible. The painting was dreadful - I know first graders who can paint better. I just kept hoping it would be over soon.

Not the right actor for Gamache, doesn't have the emotional nuance for him, especially unable to communicate the balance of intelligence/strength/deep kindness/wisdom.  Gamache does that with facial expression, but it would be ok if he could do it with voice. He seems to act just like he did for Lyndley, a completely different personality! If they'd gotten a British actor who could communicate strength and emotional nuance it would be OK, but since they didn't they should have at least gotten a Canadian one.

The other actors are fine, and Fournier as Nichol is perfect, unlikable and perfect.",1433721600,,612,5.11

6487204,5,B00LH98QTK,"Loved this adaptation of the Louise Penny book.  It was a bit of an adjustment for me to accept Nathaniel Parker in this role as I do identify him with so many other wonderful works.  And I do have in my mind a different Gamache.  But after awhile I was able to suspend my sense of disbelief and get involved in what this film wanted to tell me.

I also had to make some mental adjustments about the village of Three Pines.  On film, the location seems bigger, more open, more accessible, more ""normal"" somehow.  But the film location is truly beautiful.  And the home of Clara and Peter is perfect on the outside and in the kitchen - I found their art studio rooms not nearly cluttered enough!  But that is personal and does not detract from the story.

I would truly love to see more of these stories adapted to film.  All in all, I thought this was a good adaptation, and stands up well on its own.  Very good production values, excellent acting, and I thought the story stood up well.  I liked the woods views of the murder scene.  And the thoughtful adaptations of the characters came through for me.  I had actually forgotten ""whodunit"" - so the story carried me along as if I were seeing it for the first time.

Louise Penny's characters, the village of Three Pines, the artistic sensitivities are totally lost, almost as if the script writers had been told what the story was about, rather than reading the book themselves.  There is so much wrong, in fact, that it seems impossible to list the flaws individually or even in groups.

A friend gave me the DVD and I was hoping for a decent portrayal, although from the first moment, I knew Nathaniel Parker was the wrong actor to play Gamache.  Let's just say that in the books, Gamache is a more grandfatherly type. Jean-Luc is not a matinee idol.  Clara and Peter Morrow are at least in their mid-forties, and she is so distracted that one often finds paint or food in her hair.  Even the village isn't a good match.  It's old and mostly an art colony, made up of a close-knit group of people.  Every one of them is totally unlike how they are depicted in the book.

This was so disappointing that I began complaining soon after the start.  I love Penny's books.  That makes this movie too bad to recommend in any way.",1430956800,6,1137,4.444444444444445

I think that this could be developed into a decent series, but changes would need to be made:  first, the writers need to step up their game.  This was just too goofy.  I won't give away any spoilers, but the ending was implausible to me.  Second, the female detective underling (Agent Yvette Nichol) was portrayed as a moody, insubordinate, prejudiced slime ball.  The only response was for Gamache to order off the scene.  No appropriate follow-up discipline was really carried out.  I just found the whole sub-plot to be an unnecessary, unrealistic diversion.  The writers could have developed this story line more, showing behind-closed-doors ""counseling"" of the undisciplined subordinate, who then reveals why she acts the way she does.
In short, it wasn't that great.  I expected better, and was a bit disappointed.  I hope they make more, as I am always hoping for more Nathaniel Parker stuff, but unless they make huge improvements, there's not much hope.",1426636800,3,1157,5.005235602094241

Don't get me wrong some of those cast members to a decent job under the cloud of such disappointing dialogue; like as Kate Hewlett as the murder victim's best friend, and there may be something interesting about Susanna Fournier as Officer Yvette Nichol, though for the life of me I couldn't tell what it was in light of her having the worst written character of the cast. On the other hand, I doubt a good script could have saved Anthony Lemke's performance as Inspector Ganache's sidekick Jean-Guy Beauvoir, and unfortunately most of the actors took his lead, and can someone explain to me how a story is set in Quebec and yet not a single French Canadian accent is heard.  Now that is the real mystery.
If you are a fan of series like Murder She Wrote or Walker: Texas Ranger, you may enjoy this, but the bar in television has been risen and most people expect something more.

6487290,4,B00LH98QTK,"If you have read Louise Penney's Inspector Gamache series, you may enjoy see it come to life through the plot of the first book STILL LIFE.  Watched it last night and here's what I appreciated about it in no particular order:

* village looked as described in the book

* interior of the Bed and Breakfast is alone worth seeing this film for

* Inspector Gamache, as portrayed by Nathaniel Parker, has the depth and gravitas that he does in the books

* Ruth is a tad less curmudgeonly in this film than in the book but actress did a splendid job with the character

* scenery of the area was exquisite filmed at the peak of the fall colors

* plot seemed a tad choppy in this film

* wish Myrna, the bookstore owner, and some of the other characters had more lines

The action centered more on Gamache and his team than the villagers.  For the first in a series, it was a good effort.  Would have liked to have heard more from the villagers that we love.  Usually after several shows, the series and characters hit their stride.  I hope more films are made based upon the books in this series.  It's a good start with Nathaniel Parker as Gamache, the scenic town, and the main characters.  Any issues with this first film are fixable I think.

Louise Penny's wonderful main character, Armande Gamache, charming, witty, soulful and most of all Montreal francais in the book is played by Nathanial Parker, english as Oxford without a congenial twinkle throughout. Clara and Peter, middle aged in the books are played by a GQ stud and a flaxen haired actress who's probably considered just slightly pretty by modern standards. Two of the most wonderful supporting characters, Gabri and Myrna, are slimmed down both in importance and body size so that they are both insignificant. Myrna has a hair weave for god's sake.

And worst of all, the primary character in the books, the magical town of Three Pines, looks like a street in a middling tourist town instead of the bucolic enclave that artists, teachers, and those looking for peace stumble upon in the mountains outside of Montreal.

I hope another film of this book series isn't made until they can use actors who can capture the fullness of the characters and create a location that captures the wonder of the town. I'll be flabbergasted if that actually happens.",1422316800,20,1224,4.908212560386473

Out of the blue it seems, CI Gamache appears with his retinue into this tiny hamlet. A local teacher has been killed, and it takes an army to find her killer. It appears that Gamache directs traffic, and sits around reading much of the time, while his henchmen and woman do the real work. He gets off track at times, and is relieved of his position by phone. Anthony Lemike, who plays Inspector Beauvoir, takes over in this Eastern Quebec province, and with the assistance of Gamache solves the crime. No police force, so they take over an extra dining room. All evidence points to an archery club and and some kind of deft arrow. The townspeople, most of them, are caring and all loved the dead teacher.

What this film has going for it, is the beautiful scenery in Fall. Reminds me of New England, in its beauty. Other than that fans of Louise Penney may like this film, not so much for me.

Nathaniel Parker is a good actor capable of being a lead detective (Inspector Lynley) in a series. I really enjoyed him as Inspector Lynley. I think he was miscast as Chief Inspector Gamache. He seemed stiff and out of place. He didn't have the right accent. I think he would have done a  much better job if he had a quality script to work with and good directing. It's the job of the director to help the actors get into their characters. The script was trite and very predictable.  The cast appeared amateurish on the screen.

One of the most appealing qualities of the Three Pines books is the wonderfully drawn rich character development in all the integral parts of the plot. If I had not read the book first I don't think I would have even understood what this movie was about.  I was very disappointed with the movie as I felt all of the characters were mere shadows of the books wonderfully full and rich eccentric villagers. Gamache is a fully drawn and deeply cerebral character that draws the reader in and keeps your interest peaked while inviting you to be his confidant.  Jean Guy has a deep platonic love for Gamache which was sadly missing from the movie and Nichol's tragic sneer was completely absent. Also absent was the wonderful acerbic, cranky Ruth, and our best friend Myrna who on a bad day could hold the whole village together was relegated to a token walk on role.  I was so looking forward to the possibility of seeing these wonderful characters step from the pages to the screen and it just didn't happen.

6487314,1,B00LH98QTK,"So disappointed.  That is Three Pines?  No way.  This happens all the time when books are made into film.  Really should have been a mini-series so characters can be expanded and explored, as in the book.  Who was the casting director? All the women, with the exception of Ruth Zardo, are nothing physically like the characters in Ms. Penny's wonderful mysteries. And even Ruth is not the foul-mouth hag we have all come to love. What's the point then of creating the film version?  What crumbs could stick to Clara's lovely well-coiffed waves? Always pictured her as a fairer version of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. And Myrna? More an Oprah Winfrey size and personality. Mary Elizabeth and Oprah are both very beautiful but would have gotten into character. Can't you picture a Mary Elizabeth type looking all snotty and snorting from crying?  Even Reine-Marie; a brunette version of Louise Penny; beautiful and classy with sleek hair and high cheekbones. Chief inspector? Had never seen him in anything before, so believable but expected Gamache to look older, as well as his wife. They are supposed to be grandparents and although we are all happy everyone looks younger and more fit these days..still. Beauvoir? Darker and more dashing. This is what happens when readers become so enthralled with the character/ensemble in a reading series. 'sigh'..need to get over disappointment. Thousands of readers wish to move to the mystical town of Three Pines and drink and eat with these very likable folk. Well, for summer months anyway. But next time? Please, don't give in to the TV folks' casting.  Really, how much more money can an author need/want in order to succumb to a slaying of her own children..sad.",1420761600,3,1710,4.975438596491228

6487316,3,B00LH98QTK,"Louise Penny writes beautifully. I didn't know mysteries could be written so beautifully and lyrically. I wanted to see how well the movie did. I thought the movie stuck admirably to the book, but with several omissions which they probably didn't have time for. I would have liked more of this backstory, however, to complete the characters and their part in the storyline, like the niece Solange, etc.

It is a murder mystery set in a small town in SE Canada. Inspector Gamache is a well-seasoned and popular inspector in his group at the Surete, but not popular with his supervisor. You don't get all of this from the movie. I remember it from the books. This may be why a Chief Inspector in Montreal gets sent to the small town of Three Pines. I can't remember. The murder of a well-loved retired teacher is done by bow and arrow. Naturally, there are hunters in the community. There is also a realtor/niece waiting rather coldly to inherit the house, and the story set in a nice community of folks. If you don't like the movie, please do still read the books. It must have been hard to capture the refinements of the book in the movie. They didn't quite succeed.

Regarding casting, compared to the book, I thought it was a mixed success. I thought Parker made a good Gamache in looks although I picture Gamache as being a bit heavier. If they had stuck to the book, Peter and Clara Morrow would be at least a decade older, and Clara would be frumpier. As it is, this Clara is beautiful, and they just dress her up as frumpily as they can. Similarly, the African-American bookstore owner/retired psychologist is not developed at all. In the book, she is very heavy and outgoing. Perhaps in the first book, she didn't have as many lines? I don't remember. In the movie, she is thin and quiet. Agent Nichols should be heavier with bad skin, and she should wear ill-fitting cheap business suits, but the actress does capture the character well (sullen, cannot admit mistakes, angry, know-it-all, etc.). I thought she came later in the series, but maybe not. Ruth Zardo is cast brilliantly. However, they should have let her curse and drink more as she does in the book. It adds a lot to the character of the old poet and the community. Most of the choices for casting did not upset my mental image. They did better than America in that they didn't replace every single character with a beautiful model, but they didn't do as well as the UK in casting ""real"" people. The Morrows really didn't fit my image from the books. Of course, movies don't have to match descriptions perfectly if the actors do a good job with the characters. These actors seemed to not to be committed to the characters, distant? (phoning it in).

It annoyed me that they spoke English except for instances where they used French names so perfectly that I couldn't understand them. The contrast was too great. Commit to one or the other. I would have preferred it to be in French with English subtitles. It is set in Quebec after all. The wide shots of the country are beautiful. They don't seem to have any good neighborhood to film in, however. No picturesque (or not) small town. So they avoid shots like the town square, or whatever you would call it.

I'm glad I watched it, but it is not, of course, as good as the book. There is too much omitted. However, they stuck pretty accurately to the story, as far as I can remember, in what they did show. The movie just didn't evoke the same feelings as the books do.",1420502400,,3490,4.526148969889065

The lack of fluidity made the film appear as if it was a play with characters walking among fall leaves as interludes to the next scene. Any episode of Murder She Wrote bests this movie. (It's that bad) I am a Nathaniel Parker fan so I was quite disappointed with his performance and perhaps even more disappointed that he chose to be in this movie.",1419552000,24,684,4.516129032258065

I don't think the acting was on a par with similar BBC mystery shows, i.e., Midsommer Murders, Poirot, etc.  Gamache is well cast (Nathaniel Parker is hard to beat) and Jean Guy as well but the other folks don't fit the character descriptions in the book as well as I had hoped - Olivier should be blond and handsome and Gabri should be larger, Ruth seemed dull and ignorant and the acting was poor and Myrna is going to have to put on a great deal more weight to be believable.  Nor did the location feel as it did in the book-- a little too overdone and a bit grungier -- I didn't feel as if the homes formed a ""circle"" around the green nor did it seem that the B&B was directly across from the homes.. That being said, it is still a great story and I think most people will enjoy watching this movie (mostly because it stars Nathanlel Parker) but the story is a good one.

Even though the fade to black is annoying and some of the character development could have been stronger, for instance, Ruth does not come through nearly as irascible as in the books (but possibly Acorn television did not want to include that kind of profanity), the Canadian scenery and Parker's performance make up for it.",1418169600,,608,5.173469387755102

The quirky residents of Three Pines and the Surete homicide detectives who seem to spend a lot of time looking for murderers in this undocumented Canadian village are a pleasure to follow with each new book.  Unfortunately, the casting of Nathaniel Parker as Chief Inspector Armand Gamache struck me as a poor choice for this intellectual and warm French Canadian protagonist.  At best, Parker is stiff and quick to anger.  He makes Ruth Zardo's character look warm and fuzzy.  Too bad.",1417996800,,625,5.138613861386139
6487343,2,B00LH98QTK,"I am a huge Louise Penny fan, and Chief Inspector Gamache is my favorite detective of all times so I looked forward to this film with anticipation.  What a disappointment!  As many other reviewers have said, Nathaniel Parker is a fine actor.  He was a great Insp. Lynley, but he is not Armand Gamache.  I think Penny's Gamache is older, more battle scarred and kinder, with a kindness that comes from a deep understanding of human nature. The film does not convey these qualities at all, and it is these qualities that makes Gamache so special as a character.

Gamache was miscast and incompletely written.  Other characters were simply poorly written.  The best example of this is Ruth.  Physically the casting was dead on, but the way the character was written doesn't do justice to the acerbic character in Penny's books.  The only character that I really liked was Agent Nichol.  She was well cast and the writers displayed her awkwardness, bluntness and frustrations very well.

There is one other very important character in the books that was mishandled in this production - the town of Three Pines itself.  In the novels the village has an almost mystic quality.  The town (or sets) they used for this film look like any small lakeside resort  but certainly not a town in the middle of a forest.  There is nothing special about it.  In fact you don't even get to see the three pines until the last shot of the piece.

Finally, Louise Penny's books are dense with plot, emotion, and subtext.  This adaptation of her book is light, disjointed and incomplete. The back story for all these characters is completely missing:  Gamache is an outcast among many of his peers for refusing to cover up a case of police corruption, Jean Guy has a history of drug abuse, Nichol's career was in jeopardy before Gamache takes her onto his team.  There is no sense of this in this production. I suspect Still Life: A Three Pines Mystery is the first in a series of films based on the Gamache books.  I guess they can't change the cast at this point, but I hope the writing improves.",1417996800,35,2075,4.63013698630137

6487347,5,B00LH98QTK,"STILL LIFE: A THREE PINES MYSTERY. 2013. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his team arrive in Three Pines to solve the unusual murder of a much-loved woman and find dark secrets shadowing this usually peaceful village. At first, in this police procedural, the death of a retired teacher seems like a bow and arrow hunting accident. But Gamache of Quebec's national police suspects murder. Digging deeper into the secrets of Three Pines, an idyllic, eccentric and beautiful village of creative types,  Gamache, a good and honorable man, finds deceit, dark secrets, and hidden rage. Starring Nathaniel Parker (INSPECTOR LYNLEY) in the title role as Gamache; Anthony Lemke (WHITE HOUSE DOWN), as his loyal Inspector Jean-Guy Beauvoir; Kate Hewlett (REPUBLIC OF DOYLE) as Clara Marlow and Susanna Fournier (BEING HUMAN) as Inspector Yvette Nichol.  The CBC television production was filmed in Quebec's picturesque Eastern Townships, based on the best-selling, award-winning novel by popular Canadian author Louise Penny. The entertainment consists of one DVD running approximately 88 minutes plus extras, Behind-The-Scenes, featurettes about the book, about the characters and about Three Pines.  Plus, thank goodness, subtitles.  I received this as a review copy.

The film is set at the Canadian Thanksgiving, which falls on the American Columbus Day weekend, and the scenery is gorgeous.  Parker does a substantial job of carrying the mystery, though one character wondered how a presumably French-speaking character could speak such posh English, as did I.  But the characterizations are, by and large, on the shallow side, the characters lacking the wit for which Penny is known.  The acting is all right.  The mystery itself is also all right, not particularly deep or difficult.  Ive read a couple of Pennys crime novels, BEAUTIFUL MYSTERY and TRICK OF THE LIGHT, though not the one used here, but Id have to say Im not that familiar  with her work, or that crazy about it.  However, Id consider this a good and honorable translation to film of a popular mystery tale.",1417478400,,2072,5.245454545454545

It is not exactly portrayed as each reader imagines it to be, but it does a very good job of bringing the series to life.

Nathaniel Parker was a major miscast as Cheif Inspector Gamache.  I had seen him as Inspector Linley in the PBS series, so I expected more in the quality of the acting but it seemed as though he was making no effort at all-- he was stilted and awkward, and appeared to be almost as bored as I was. Inspector Nichol, who in the book is a complicated character, comes across in the film as a petulant, spoiled middle schooler.  There is no sense, in the film, as to why Chief Inspector Gamache would put up with such a truculent junior officer. The acting, in general, was very poor.  Nothing compelling here at all--no character development and a genuinely lackluster cast.  I can't think of a single person I would care to pass this DVD on to.

I felt that Gomache and Ruth Zardo were realistic  to my imaginings and Clara somewhat so.  Peter was a weak character.  Myrna was hardly mentioned (and not fat! as she is in the book).

6487368,1,B00LH98QTK,"A friend I worked with years ago in television post production told me once that a ""director only makes one casting mistake."" By that he meant that IF a director makes a bad casting choice, it diminishes the quality of the production. For example, ""Legend"" directed by Ridley Scott was a beautifully-made film, but Tom Cruise was completely miscast and thus the film is considered one of Scott's failures. (Even though I still love to watch it for the visuals.)

In my opinion that theory applies here. Nathaniel Parker is a fine actor, but he is NOT Inspector Gamache. Not even close. So this film version of Louise Penny's great debut mystery fails right from the start. Oh, and as someone else has pointed out, Myrna is heavy set, not a slim fashion model.

Every person who watched wished that they hadn't.  The actor who portrayed Armand Gamache was extremely poor, and nothing like he is written in the books.  Clara and Peter, who readers know are an eccentric and rather unattractive couple, were played by very good looking actors that were all wrong.  Myrna, Gabri and some of the other characters were barely a side note.  The worst of all was the portrayal of Ruth Zardo.  It was hideous.  All Penny readers know that Three Pines is a small hamlet tucked into the woods, but in the movie it's portrayed as a modern city with a highway running through it!

Myrna, an important character with sage advice is missing.  You see her, although, like Ruth, she is not true to the book.  The richness of the writing and the mystery and beauty of three pines may be hard to put into a movie.  One wonders what Masterpiece Theater would have done with the story.

A lot of the subtle humor from the books are gone - from Agent Nichol's encounter with the message in the mirror at Ruth's house to the psychedelic wallpaper Yvonne buys.  It's rather sad because this seems to be geared to Louise Penny fans; at least too much is taken as understood, character development is skipped as if they expect viewers to fill in blanks that shouldn't exist in a well-crafted movie.  The hints of Canadian life and history that were in the books seem to have been lost in the transition to film.
And they do not show how you can sing 'Silent Night' to the tune of 'What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor'.  That's sad, because I've been trying to figure that out for myself since the book came out.

There's one brilliant moment where Nichol calls Gamache on his friendship with Clara, and that's it.  It's a good movie, but not a great one.

I never saw the Lynley series so had no preconceived ideas about Nathanial Parker. In my.opinion, he was excellent. I hope Three Pines continues as a series.",1412985600,,317,4.389830508474576
6487389,3,B00LH98QTK,"It is so very hard to review a short movie about a full-to-the-brim-book.  Louise Penny's Three Pines mysteries are exceptionally good, with full character development and consistency over the 10 book series. It's what you love about her books. The town of Three Pines becomes a setting that is developed fully in your brain so that you have a map in your head of where everything is and what each element looks like.  Since the village of Three Pines does not exist in reality, the movie makes do with another real town in Quebec, but unfortunately it does not look like the Three Pines I imagined or the one Louise Penny described except for the occasional shot of the 3 pines which seems to have been shot in another location.  How could it be otherwise, since Three Pines only exists in  our imagination. The town they picked was very pretty but it wasn't Three Pines. As for the characters, the overall casting seems flawed.  I was able to accept Nathaniel Parker as Gamache and felt he could become more Gamache-like in future stories (just as Gamache developed in the book series). Jean-Guy was acceptable, Clara was also believable and Ruth was just shy of being Ruth (I'm guessing they did not want to bring her full bitterness and pain into a short movie) but every other character was way off.  Myrna's role was never explained (and she did not fit the character's description). Olivier and Peter were totally off and distracting.  Everybody was too pretty.  The story line was also distorted.  I know you can't put all the details in but if you had not read the book I'm not sure you could follow the story to its conclusion. And what about the snakes?  I give this movie 3 stars; if you are a fan of Penny's it is good to see the attempt to bring all to life.  Maybe there will be another and it will improve and develop with time just as the series has done.",1412985600,,1872,4.508875739644971
6487390,5,B00LH98QTK,Well done.  I hope they will continue and produce the other books in the series.,1412812800,,80,4.333333333333333

As the series has grown--there are now 10--so has Penny's talented writing and the depth of its many plots and continuing characters. I can't compare this DVD's story to the book it's based on because it's 10 years since I read the original, but I can say I enjoyed it a lot. Meantime, I've just finished book #10 in the series ""The Long Way Home,"" and interestingly, the pair of characters at the heart of that one--Clara and Peter Morrow--also have prominent roles here.) As for the dear and hilarious old gal poet Ruth Zardo, the actress who plays her here gets the role just right, even though she has to do it without Ruth's duck. As for Chief Inspector Gamache, the handsome hunk Nathaniel Parker who plays him is good in the role, though not at all like the Gamache in my head who is older, shorter, wiser and not a hunk (but isn't that almost always the case with cops who jump from page to screen?).

The extras are well worth a watch on their own.  Particularly the author interviews and insights. Here's hoping this first Gamache DVD won't be the last.",1412812800,,1416,5.2844444444444445

6487393,4,B00LH98QTK,"Strong points:  the beautiful setting of ""Three Pines"", the bistro, the movie is fairly close to the book and so IMHO, not a bad job capturing all.

Not that the following are necessarily bad points -- just a personal thing.  I pictured a totally different Gamache.  More like a Tom Selleck type.  A little more rugged but then once the movie kicked in, Parker became believable as Armand Gamache  Also, did anyone notice that Myrna had no lines in this film?  Maybe one or two but not sure if even that.  As for some of the characters, I pictured a different Ruth Zardo but again, once the movie rolled on, this actor became believable in the role.

Louise Penny fans should at least see it once.  The curiosity will be unsatisfied if you don't accommodate it.  ;-)",1412726400,,766,4.518248175182482

6487396,5,B00LH98QTK,"Nathaniel Parker as CI Gamache! Clever, perfect casting for this adaptation of the Louise Penny novel. This film moves quickly, so for those accustomed to the more leisurely pace of Penny's books, it may be a surprise, but the action canters along and carries you with it. Those of us who liked Parker as Inspector Lynley will enjoy seeing him in this new role. He takes charge and subtly but skillfully tracks clues, shifting direction when needed to reach the surprising conclusion. Absorbing tale, and the DVD includes some nice extras including cast members talking about their roles, and their own enjoyment of Louise Penny's Three Pines Mystery books. Highly recommended!",1411516800,3,677,5.108108108108108
6487397,2,B00LH98QTK,"I have not purchased the DVD yet and may not.  When I saw the cast list, I was greatly disappointed.  It was not that the actors are not good but they were so poorly cast and do not fit the characters in the books.  I had hoped for someone such as the French actor Franois Cluzet to play Gamache or Kevin Kline who I think speaks French too.
I thought that BBC Mystery would pick-up her books or even a series of movies would have worked. These mysteries are really insights into the human condition, small lessons in history, a little philosophy with thoughtful injections of humor.  I must admit Ruth Zardo has become my favorite character.  In a review that I read, Ruth Zardo  was described as an internationally known poet, a bitterly sardonic resident of Three Pines, who appears to have ""very little impulse control""  Ruth and I have a lot in common.
**Do purchase the books and the audio books too.  I honestly purchase both as Ralph Cosham does such a spectacular job of reading them.  A beautiful Mystery has been my favorite so far.  I loved the contrast between the power of music and the power of silence  as quoted from Louise Penny.",1411344000,3,1147,4.492753623188406
6487398,2,B00LH98QTK,"Very unfortunate... Nathaniel Parker is nothing like the character of Gamache in the books.  It is almost impossible to accept him in this role  (especially with his previous role as Inspector L.)

6487399,3,B00LH98QTK,"My wife is a mystery fan and has read Louise Penny's works, and she was eager to watch this dramatization. In the end, she liked it, more or less, though she did note some differences between this production and the original novel, something which other reviewers have commented on. Coming to this with no experience of having read the original material, I confess that I was put off from the very beginning by what I thought to be a very strange tone. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the manner in which the main character interacted with locals and with his staff struck me as unprofessional at times and puzzling at others. I also thought that the somewhat communal life of the principal local characters wasn't clearly defined, leading me to be left a bit at sea in terms of understanding those relationships. Finally, I found the resolution of the mystery quite unconvincing, though it had the novelty of being supplied by someone other than the main detective. All in all, this was a nicely atmospheric story, but one which really failed to paint a convincing and compelling portrait of the central character.",1410825600,,1122,4.729591836734694
6487400,5,B00LH98QTK,"The scenic autumn location of east Quebec is like a tourism documentary. You will want to visit, if not for the body of a local that everyone loved found in the idyllic woods. Mysteriously no weapon and an odd wound, but there are secrets to unveil in this picturesque peaceful villa of Three Pines. Three Pines is liken to a Canadian Midsomer Murders with the quaintness of Jan Karon's Mitford, if Mitford had murders. The true romantic film location is Stanbridge East, Quebec, now sure to be a tourist destination. Viewers might want more, but enough investigating takes place to find the killer in 88 minutes of story. My wife agreed, thus two 5-star ratings.

This is BASED on Louise Penny's ""Still Life"" book, and the author was on set all the way approving what must be included and what could be skipped due to shortened film adaptation need. Thus, one can't complain the film's not the book. Penny approves of 2 modes of her story. Penny is grand on characterization, and the movie comes through for several roles. Others' back-story had to be left to the imagination. CI Gamache (Nathaniel Parker) comes across real, with conscious, and a heart. Clara (Kate Hewlett) is to love. What a warmth of spirit, and lovely face matching excellent acting. 2 others that stood out were new cop Agent Nichol (Susanna Fournier) arrogant, big attitude, and stumbles but rises kicking. Ruth (Deborah Grover) is so good at playing the old local matriarch curmudgeon that she falls into my ""loveable"" character box.

SDH SUBTITLES are provided for the feature as well as several film segments of bonus material, all good. I've been to Quebec, and the fact that more English is spoken than French is not unnerving to me, since the film company targets more than East Quebec, but all the world these days.

This is another great Canada series, a rising contingent in the TV/DVD market. And since ""Still Life"" was only Louise Penny's first of ten books, there is promise for more Quebec mystery in the future. This was my first experience with Louise Penny. Our small town local library has ALL 10 of her books. Now I'll read till the next film is produced.",1410480000,30,2148,4.753351206434316

6487402,2,B00LH98QTK,I've tried three times now and each time I'm halted by the terrible acting and dialogue.

6487403,3,B00LH98QTK,"Nathaniel Parker is credible as Inspector Gramache.  The movie told the story of the 1st book but didn't develop some of the main characters that are important as the book series goes on.  The Three Pines Mysteries are essentially about characters and their interaction with themselves, the beautiful environment, and the inspector.  This should have been a miniseries so the characters would have been developed in more depth and future series would have been set up better.  Oh and food is very important in the books.

Nathaniel Parker played a wonderful Inspector Gamache (I am not familiar with Inspector Linley), although I had imagined the inspector a little older.  But once I let go of requiring the actors to look like my imagined characters, all gleaned from the 10 books I have read, I enjoyed the movie immensely.  I highly recommend this movie and hope that all of the books are turned into film.  I traveled 250 miles this past weekend to see Louise Penny in Seattle and have a book signed.  She is not only an exceptional writer, but a very warm and fun speaker.  Viva Gamache!",1409788800,62,737,4.496240601503759

I suppose, having read ALL the books in sequence, I""ve developed a mental picture of these wonderful characters whose facets of personality and relationnships are revealed with each new story.  I had a difficult time accepting Nathaniel Parker since he is so connected to the Inspector Lynley character and I've always pictured Gamache as a beefier cop.  Overall, the characters are true to the books, but they are too attractive.  Myrna is supposed to be heavy and Clara, while a lovely person, is not beautiful.  What would have been the problem with casting ordinary-looking actors?  My biggest issue is with atmosphere.  In the books, there is a magical quality to Three Pines, almost as if it has been plucked out of the ether.  Much is made of how difficult is is to find the place and lack of cell phone service.  I wish that aspect of Three Pines had been more fully explored.  After all, the village is an important character in most of the stories.  I do hope they continue to adapt the books for the screen.  They are wonderful mysteries.  Read the books!",1409529600,247,1169,4.64390243902439
6487406,3,B00LH98QTK,"Pretty Good.  But could not get used to Nathaniel Parker as Gamache.  It was not just his previous role as Inspector Lynley, though that was certainly part of it.  He just did not portray well the character of Gamache as has been developed in the books.  I had similar problems with some of the other characters, especially Jean Guy and Peter.  That is always a problem when putting on the screen well-developed literary characters, but here, the characters mostly just did not seem very French, and only parts of the film had the vibrancy of the books.  Plus, the pacing seemed a bit off to me.  I would still recommend watching it, but just don't expect it to have the same feeling as the books.",1409529600,94,697,4.528

8665868,4,B00LH98QTK,"I disagree with the naysayers. I enjoyed the film quite a lot. I realize there is little one can do to argue against other's emotional reactions to an artistic product but movies aren't books. It is the rare film that will satisfy all those who love the book it is adapted from. Look at the many who think the Harry Potter films were awful and we won't even begin on the Lord of the Rings critics. Suffice it to say, I found the film, Still Life, to be quite French Canadian and I've been to Quebec many times. I also liked the casting of Gamache who suffered rather a lot at the hands of his own scruples. It's true there wasn't much for his wife to do or even much of a reference to her. Had you not read the book you might even have been surprised at her appearance in the end. But the film was only 90 minutes long.

The movie meanders through its roughly 90 minute length, letting the viewer appreciate a tightknit and attractive small town while throwing out a number of clues.  The movie appears to have been intended as a setup for a series, as it devotes some screen time to building up the characters of Gamache and his investigative team.
