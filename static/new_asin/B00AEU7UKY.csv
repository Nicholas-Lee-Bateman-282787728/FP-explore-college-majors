8550660,5,B00AEU7UKY,Love this DVD! It is the second in their series and is geared for older kids. I have used it with students with special needs and friends with fibromyalgia and lupus. It allows you to do partner work in a very condusive format. It is gentle yet challenging. I encourage to give it a try! And proudly wear your Shanti Generation gear!,1467849600,,333,4.387096774193548

8550662,5,B00AEU7UKY,"As a yoga teacher for children and teens, I'm always looking for inspiring teachers/content that can help me to grow in my practice. When I came across Shanti Generations Partner yoga for teens I was instantly moved and inspired. Abby Wills creates a safe and peaceful environment for teens to connect with themselves and to each other. Learning to work together and to listen to one another are some of the benefits that teens will learn to do while watching this DVD. I will certainly use these methods in my own teachings. With a DVD like this out on the market, I am convinced it will help a generation learn to work together more harmoniously. I highly recommend this to teachers, Parents, teens and any yoga teacher who is interested in working with children and teens.",1355961600,8,775,4.705882352941177
8550663,5,B00AEU7UKY,"I have never seen a better video that is so completely suited for all kinds of teenagers.  This  video features REAL teenagers who are not perfect ""model types"" who sample the poses and share what inspires them about yoga.  The instruction from Mrs. Wills is clear and concise without getting into the preachy-ness that some yoga instructors insist upon.  This DVD can breach horizons and bring yoga to teenagers who've never considered yoga before.  The ability to chose sequences is unparalleled to other DVDs.  This is a great video to offer to teens to utilize with their friends or in physical education classes! It is a great compliment to Shanti Generation's first DVD for individual practice.",1355270400,7,700,4.991379310344827
