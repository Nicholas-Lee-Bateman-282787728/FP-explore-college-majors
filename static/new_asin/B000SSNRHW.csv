8206679,5,B000SSNRHW,"I have been married 10 years and i got this DVD to help keep me and my wife love life fresh.  She loves to get massages and i love to give them to her but i don't have any formal training so i got this DVD to give me a few more ideas.  I learned a lot about technuqie and my wife has noticed.  I also watched it with her and now i even get a little massage from time to time and that is just an added bonus.  i suggest this video for any couple looking for something new, with a willingness to please your partner.",1474675200,,514,3.7757009345794392
8206680,4,B000SSNRHW,"This DVD arrived packaged like new from the store and contains some decent information on couples' massage. If you're looking at this to get just a basic introduction to massage I would recommend Googling a bit and reading up on massage before watching this. I like to think I'm fairly decent at massage but I did learn a few things I didn't know previously. This video will also help if you're more of a visual learner than typical web searches will provide.

However if you're like my husband (ahem) who knows nothing about massage, this is a great place to start. It mentions ambiance in general, mood and aroma of the room, and how to work on two clients. Obviously we have no need for that aspect, he and I just wanted to use this to get ideas on how to better take care of one another. For that purpose it wasn't bad at all.",1474416000,,830,4.354838709677419
8206681,5,B000SSNRHW,"Let me first mention that I am not a massage therapist.  I am simply a married guy who wanted to be able to help my wife relax more.

This DVD has alot to it.  It talks about things like temperature of the room to lighting.  (Things that didn't apply to me as much)

It also has alot of actual massage video, it gave me lots of good ideas on things to massage to help my hard working wife have a better nights sleep.  I am glad I own this and will refer to it for years to come.",1473292800,,478,3.826530612244898

8206683,3,B000SSNRHW,"The description of the video made me excited to receive it. However, I found it to be just average. The professional advice that is given is not in-depth and is really just compiled of things you could find easily by googling. Aromatherapy was breezed over. It would've been a nice addition to have a few great recipes, as well as safety information. There are many oils that require caution (clove oil, which was mentioned, can cause major irritation if used incorrectly, many oils are phototoxic). I felt the room set up and pricing were both also skimmed over. The bulk of the video was watching her instruct a couple while they participated in massage which was acceptable, but since this is marketed for massage therapists, more time should've been spent on the professional aspects of the topic. We know how to massage, and we can pick up how to instruct others about massage fairly quickly. I found the massage therapist in the video to be knowledgeable, but not necessarily entertaining to watch. I think this video may be suited for amatuers looking for ideas about sensual massage. I'm not sure of the benefit to therapists, which is what I sought when I purchased it.",1464220800,,1178,4.779411764705882

8206685,3,B000SSNRHW,"At 54.95 this is a very expensive DVD, is it worth it? If you want to learn about massage in hopes of pursuing a career in massage therapy I wouldn't recommend it. I felt the video did not focus enough on massage but on other topics such as setting the mood and how to advertie which was nothing but super-obvious tips and not very helpful. I don't think the DVD alone is going to help you and for [...] bucks is an awfully expensive supplement to in-person instruction. As for those with a more lets say more casual interest in massage I have to inform you that that the amount of massage in this video is very dissapointing. You have about 20 minutes of the man face up, then about 20 minutes of the woman (gorgeous) face down, naked, with only her posterior covered. The massage is filmed beautifully and better than those you can see for free on YouTube, but again for [...] bucks I feel is too expensive if you want to just watch for fun.",1241827200,2,943,4.303370786516854
