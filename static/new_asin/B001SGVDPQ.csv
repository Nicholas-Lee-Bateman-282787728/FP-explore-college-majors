3785680,5,B001SGVDPQ,"I chose the 5 scale rating, because I have always been a huge fan of Gigantor since my childhood, and I am still a dedicated fan. I would highly recommend this video to everyone interested in purchasing Gigantor.

Sincerely,
Sandra",1373068800,,231,4.775
3785681,5,B001SGVDPQ,I remember Gigantor from my childhood when I would rush home from school to watch it and dray it. It is nice to relive those days for brief moments from time to time.,1371081600,,166,4.0606060606060606
3785682,5,B001SGVDPQ,"Lovingly assembled collection of GIGANTOR cartoons. Fun, entertaining, lightweight -- the bad guys are not terribly scary and the good guys win every time (with the help of Gigantor, of course). Crazy Japanese+American amalgam that after translation may not always make sense but is good-natured and uplifting. A boy with his giant robot?! What more could you ask for in a 1960s cartoon? BUY THIS AT ONCE WHILE IT'S STILL AVAILABLE because they're sure not making cartoons like Gigantor any more!!!",1360800000,,498,5.160493827160494
3785683,4,B001SGVDPQ,"The Gigantor shows included in this edition are complete and very good.  The DVD is practically impossible to copy, even for fair use (?)  The set is authored badly, apparently, and that's why it's practically impossible to copy.  One of my DVD players had trouble with a few episodes.",1360540800,,285,4.775510204081633
3785684,5,B001SGVDPQ,Thanks for the quick delivery and great quality.  I love gigantor it is an old classic and I love it so much it took me back to my childhood.  Thanks,1343347200,2,149,3.933333333333333
3785685,4,B001SGVDPQ,This sci-fi adventure is exactly as I remember it.  The video and audio quality is good.  Make sure if you use a Blu-ray player that the firmware is up to date.  This will ensure a smooth easy run.  The story is simple and easy to follow.  The plots are adult with silliness added for the kids.  I am satisfied with this for an addition to my library.  If special FX are your thing you won't find any Industrial Light and Magic here.,1341705600,,433,4.2073170731707314
3785686,4,B001SGVDPQ,"Great item. Great price, but after looking at the show, it is hard to believe I loved this show. It is so lame. I guess what you thought was so good when you were a kid, disappears.",1324166400,,181,3.918918918918919
3785687,3,B001SGVDPQ,I agree with the previous reviewer.  A strange defect also prohibits me from going straight into the episodes. Usually if I fiddle around with the skip of FF button I can eventually navigate to the shows.  I give it 3 stars because the show is great but there is also some kind of techinical problem.  I guess mine just wasn't as bad as the last guy's.,1300752000,2,352,4.303030303030303
3785688,5,B001SGVDPQ,"This is an old school must have. I just wanted to add it to my collection. It's a remember this show. My friends always want to watch it. Fast shipping, excellent quality.",1300406400,3,171,4.375
3785689,1,B001SGVDPQ,"The one star isn't for GIGANTOR, which is awesome but for a wierd defect in the discs. None of them play on my regular dvd player. They do play fine on my multi-region player. On my regular player, I will get a message if I try to play discs with the wrong coding. I do not get that message with these discs, they just won't play. I get a company logo without any sound, then just a black screen that I can't escape from. If you want GIGANTOR, buy the earlier edition on RHINO instead of this one on E1 ENTERTAINMENT. If anyone has any info on the nature of this defect, I would be interested to hear it.",1289520000,9,604,4.084033613445378
8339828,5,B001SGVDPQ,Good value,1432425600,,10,4.5
8339829,4,B001SGVDPQ,"DVDs were awesome. Arrived with corner of case broken / damaged, though. I chose to accept these, as the discs themselves were fine and did not contact the seller regarding this.",1431820800,,178,4.774193548387097
8339830,5,B001SGVDPQ,"Great classic, watched this a kid on WWOR in NY",1418601600,,47,3.8
8339831,5,B001SGVDPQ,Love this series. Great annimation. I always watched this when I was younger. I would recommend this to anyone who loves this series.,1403136000,,133,4.826086956521739
8339832,5,B001SGVDPQ,"Classic gigantor, a little something to bring back the kid in the older generations. This is also a great cartoon for anyone to get into.",1400716800,,137,4.52
8339833,5,B001SGVDPQ,"I was so young when this first series aired that I only just barely remember Gigantor,  I remember Series two much better but I remember both well enough. Watching Gigantor introduced me to what became my life long love of science fiction.  Long before even the original Star Trek I loved racing to the TV on Saturday Mornings to watch Gigantor.  I never understood why but even my parents knew Gigantor was special to me.  I was more non verbal when I was young but, I loved singing the Gigantor theme song.  I'd most ly sing the GI-GAN-TOR part only!

Gigantor was a very large powerful robot that defended the Earth from all sorts of wild weird super villians.  Gigantor animation was very crude.  Gigantor was rendered as a collection of large geometric shapes not because; the cartoon anime artists of the time lacked the eye for detail.  In the time that Gigantor was created TV as a medium was in its infancy.  Television resolution was often terrible by todays HDTV standards rendered strictly for primative black and white sets.

Notice how the black to white contrasting on Gigantors body is bold without subtle shading. Notice how Gigantor has basic regions of monochromatic shading.  Gigantor could not be elaborately drawn because on a primative black and white set's low resolution the detail would turn to mud manking the image look fuzzy.  Gigantor stories were often good if you remember the age of the kiddie audience it targets.  The weird things about Gigantor is many times the powerful robot goes after terrorists that cause trouble in this futuristic time almost as if it foretold the times we live in today.

Unfortunately for us today some fifty years in the future we lack a Gigantor like robot that can kick terrorist butt.",1393459200,,1750,4.786666666666667
8339834,5,B001SGVDPQ,These videos are so extremely prophetic of the things that have come to pass...A must see!  Look also for the 8th Man Collection.,1392595200,,129,4.608695652173913
8339835,5,B001SGVDPQ,"A great way for me to re-live youthful memories, although, as an adult, I'm now just realizing how much wit and humor the series contained.  For animation buffs, this is a must have collection as it is an important series in tracing the beginnings and evolution of anime (before the term was coined). The masters used for the DVD are from newly-minted 16mm release prints which is how the shows were sent to the network and stations in those days.  The overall quality is good.  Even better is the commentary track from Gigantor's original American producer, Fred Ladd.  Trivia: Did you know that the Gigantor theme song was recorded in an upper room at New York City's Radio City Music Hall by the NBC chorus while they were on break?  Now that I have Gigantor in my collection, I can't wait to get my other fave series from that era, Kimba The White Lion.",1391644800,4,857,4.538961038961039
8339836,5,B001SGVDPQ,"Watching this cartoon as a kid, was awesome now I have the whole series
brings back memories, and I could share it with my Grandsons.",1378512000,,133,4.36
