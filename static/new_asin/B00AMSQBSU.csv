5453599,5,B00AMSQBSU,These are four good movies especially if you enjoy Meryl Streep films. Each movie was different from the others which made it well diversified.,1403481600,,143,5.0
5453600,3,B00AMSQBSU,I found one good movie (The Bridges of Madison County) on this DVD. Guess I prefer the newer movies that Merly Streep is in.,1402272000,,124,4.208333333333333
5453601,5,B00AMSQBSU,Streep and Eastwood are among my favorites -- their performances are stunning and we wanted to own a copy of this wonderful poignant story -- I've also read the book,1401753600,,165,4.533333333333333
5453602,5,B00AMSQBSU,"If you like Meryl Streep, you will want to get this collection. Four really great movies. So glad I got this.",1400544000,,109,4.238095238095238
5453603,4,B00AMSQBSU,"I really adore three movies on here. The one that I don't adore is Heartburn. It just doesn't ""float my boat."" It is the least favorite on my Meryl movie list. The others on this collection are A+!",1400112000,,197,4.2105263157894735
5453604,4,B00AMSQBSU,"I was looking for ""Heartburn"" because 1.) I like Streep and Jack Nicholson, and 2.) because it features Carly Simon's great song, ""Coming Around Again"" as its theme song  throughout the film.  Not one of Streep's best films, I rate it as a  2 1/2 out of 4 stars.  Also included is ""Defending Your Life"" which I had never previously heard of (with good reason ! ).  Rated a 2 star out of 4 for me, it was almost a good comedy about reincarnation, Heaven and Hell.  My favorite actor in this one was Rip Torn.  Not a classic film though.  The set includes ""The Hours"" which most film fans will know, with an Oscar for Nicole Kidman as Best Actress. The set of Meryl Streep films also gives you ""The Bridges of Madison County"" featuring  super performances by Streep and Clint Eastwood.  A beautiful love story, I can't say enough about it. (Directed by Clint Eastwood.)  And all 4 movies for about 6 bucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1399680000,2,917,4.463855421686747
5453605,5,B00AMSQBSU,Im a huge Meryl Streep fan so this was a nice way for me to get 4 of her movies...,1395878400,,82,3.15
5453606,5,B00AMSQBSU,How can Meryl Streep be anything but great?  I think she is the best actress of all time.  Can not think of anything else to say.,1395187200,,129,3.923076923076923
5453647,5,B00AMSQBSU,Four very different films I enjoyed this collection of Miss Streep's work very much no matter what she does it is done well.,1394928000,,124,4.434782608695652
5453648,5,B00AMSQBSU,Love this selection of movies. Great selection for Streep fans. One of my faves is Heartburn and another is Bridges of Madison County.,1394323200,,134,4.869565217391305
5453649,4,B00AMSQBSU,"I bought this CD mainly because I couldn't find ""Heartburn,"" even on Netflix. Now that I've seen it, I understand why. It really isn't a great movie. On the other hand, ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""The Hours"" make this a great buy.",1393804800,,239,4.454545454545454
5453650,4,B00AMSQBSU,"If you've never seen ""Defending your Life"", you're missing one of the best romantic comedy movies around. Albert Brooks is hilarious
in  ""defending his life""  when put in front of a panel of judges to determine if he's worthy of going forward or being sent back. Meryl Streep is also ""defending her life"" and the two meet.  It will have you grinning ear to ear.
Bridges of Madison County is another one of Streep's great movie roles.  The chemistry between her and  Clint Eastwood is a thing of beauty.  Who said using older actors as main characters is  passe'.  Have no clue as to the other 2 movies but I'm sure they're decent.",1392768000,2,630,4.513274336283186
5453651,5,B00AMSQBSU,"Meryl Streep, as always, nailed the accent on this one, reminding me of one of my sisters-in-law.
Clint Eastwood and Meryl have great chemistry.  Got the DVD so I can watch it over and over again.
Saw it at movie theater when first released. Beautiful love story, based on bestselling book of same
title.",1392422400,,304,4.62962962962963
5453652,5,B00AMSQBSU,"This collection has two of my Meryl Streep favorites:  HEARTBURN and BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.  At the time of this purchase, the single DVD for HEARTBURN was a lot more expensive than the 4 pack collection.  I thought....OK, why not take a chance & I am so glad I did.  I would highly recommend this 4 DVD collection while it's availability lasts.  And once again, THANK YOU AMAZON!!!",1390867200,8,386,4.617647058823529

5453654,5,B00AMSQBSU,"Mery Streep exhibits her range as an actress in these films.  I bought it because I wanted to see Heartburn which as a single was outrageously priced. Heartburn is based upon Nora Ephron's first marriage.  Hours is serious too, Bridges of Madison County, if you are a woman, will make you cry, and Defending your life is a great camp movie based on New Age ideas of Heaven.  A good group at a good price and a great actress to boot.",1385337600,10,432,4.308641975308642

5453656,5,B00AMSQBSU,Meryl Streep could stand in front of the camera and read the dictionary and it would be amazing.  One of the best actresses of our time and anything she does is worth watching.  Four great films in one set.,1377561600,14,206,4.256410256410256
