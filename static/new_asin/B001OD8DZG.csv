3729829,4,B001OD8DZG,Worth watching but not one I would put among my classics. I'm glad I purchased it but it will be on the watch when I need some info from it.,1400457600,,140,3.7
3729830,5,B001OD8DZG,"Even though I also watched ""The Secrets of Chatsworth"" on PBS, there wasn't as much information about the interior of the home, only the grounds and gardens.  I hought it was nice to have the heir to the estate show us around his family home.",1382313600,3,242,4.377777777777778
3729831,5,B001OD8DZG,My husband and I like to watch films about these old houses.  They are so interesting.  Just seeing the house and the way it is put together is fascinating to us.,1376006400,3,162,4.193548387096774
3729832,3,B001OD8DZG,"It provided only the pictures and how a castle is such a important part of the well off, with all of the decorative importance of things.",1374969600,,137,4.3076923076923075
3729833,5,B001OD8DZG,"The DVD takes you through so much of the house, gives information on generations of family, shows furnishing that have been there for centuries & history about the family that has owned it.  You feel like the tour has taken you into parts of the estate that the usual visitor would have missed.",1370476800,6,294,4.547169811320755
3729834,4,B001OD8DZG,"This hour-long 1995 DVD tour of ""the grandest country house in all England,"" is a stunner. A great preview for anyone planning a visit and an entrancing enticement for the armchair traveler as well.

After the 11th Duke of Devonshire's  death in 2004, his widow, Deborah, the youngest and last of the famous Mitford sisters and well known as the author of  several marvelous books on Chatsworth*, became the Dowager Duchess. She now lives nearby in a former vicarage. (Both appear briefly in this film.) Their son, Peregrine, better known as ""Stoker,"" became the 12th Duke,  and it is he,  then the  Marquess of Hartington,  who provides the excellent narration here for the house and grounds that would, a decade later, become his.  The views  of the Chatsworth gardens throughout the four seasons are magnificent enough to make you want to plan four visits instead of just one.

Of course there've been some changes in the 18 years since this film was made and the eight since the duchy changed hands.  A visit to the Chatsworth web site showcases many of them--most particularly the 12th Duke and Duchess's addition of modern art and sculpture to both the house and grounds (loved by some, loathed by others). It also has a wealth of practical information: listings of special events, tips on how to get there and places to to eat, stay and shop on or near the estate etc.

Also of note: In 2011,  BBC  TV did a three-part series on Chatsworth, but at this writing it doesn't seem to be available on DVD  in America. I'll revisit this review if/when I learn otherwise.

3729835,4,B001OD8DZG,"This brought back lovely memories for us -- beautifully photographed and put together. Commentary is often a distraction in travel DVDs, but we found this to be low-key and pleasant.  Like another reviewer here, I wish there had been more of the gardens included, because they were a favorite for us, too. Still, it's a very pleasant way to remember a visit to Chatsworth.",1285718400,9,372,4.8125
3729836,3,B001OD8DZG,"When the late Duke was still alive, this TV documentary was made. The ""Marquess of Hartingdon"" is the ""complimentary title"" of the heir to the Duke (he is the current Duke). Lovely shots of the rooms, orante and pretty walls, furniture, the various out buildings, and the statues collected and stored in the former Oragerarium.

Ideal for those who have been there. Like a collection of movies shot by someone who had wide access. Albeit remastered from 1980's film. This DVD does not include Edensor Village, nor very much of the Deer Park.  And thank goodness it was made before the *truly awful* modern sculptures were placed in the long views!",1254700800,22,647,4.81981981981982
