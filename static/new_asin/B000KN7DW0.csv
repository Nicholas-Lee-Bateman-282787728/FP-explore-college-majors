8158248,4,B000KN7DW0,"One thing that I missed when ordering this is that it is entirely in Portuguese. This isn't really a problem, because the subtitles cover what you need to know; basically, if you have any sort of martial arts experience already you should have little trouble understanding this video.

The style of Capoeira taught here is a mixture of various styles; it's not strictly one school or the other.

The movements seem fairly clear, and the quality of the video very acceptable. I would recommend this to anyone beginning Capoeira who does not have a real-life teacher.",1281571200,9,565,4.875
