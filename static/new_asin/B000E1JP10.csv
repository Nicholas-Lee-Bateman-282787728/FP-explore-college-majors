2480135,4,B000E1JP10,"With 27 videos released over the last 13 years, VeggieTales has become something of an institution.  These computer animated vegetables have not only won over their target age group of kids but also teens and adults of every age.  The blend of silliness with seriousness works well to impart Biblical lessons to all.

The latest in the series takes on the issue of friendship.  What exactly does it take to be a good friend?  Naturally, Bob the Tomato is ready with two stories that help answer the question.

First up, we get ""The Asparagus of La Mancha.""  Don Quixote (Archibald Asparagus) runs a popular restaurant.  When he starts having a series of bad dreams, he tries to figure out what they mean.  Could the grand opening of the latest Food Factory restaurant right across the street be what the dreams were foretelling?

Naturally, Don's business drops off immediately, and he becomes concerned about loosing his business and best friends/waiter Poncho (Mr. Lunt).  Is there anything he can do to get the Food Factory to go away or is it as useless as tilting at windmills?

Up next is the silly song, one of the weaker ones.  In it, Larry tries to get his ball back from behind the wall of a ""Gated Community"" while the residences sing about how great life there is.  It's been a while, but I think I now have a new least favorite silly song.  This one had an interesting premise, but it didn't really go anywhere.

Finally comes the main feature.  Larry the Cucumber takes on the role of Sheerluck Holmes, the best detective in London.  That is, if you believe the press.  Holmes is actually not nearly as brilliant as everyone thinks he is.  The true detective is Dr. Watson (Bob the Tomato).  The two are summoned to Buckingham Palace where they must find the missing keys to the vault that contains the secret of England's greatness, The Golden Ruler.  But Watson is getting tired of Holmes hogging all the credit.  Will the riff in their relationship mean the loss of this valuable asset?

I didn't feel this entry in the series was quite up to par.  The stories were good and animation fine, but it lacked the humor of the previous entries.  Normally, these videos can be counted on to make you laugh and smile no matter your age, but this one contained few good jokes.  Instead, the stories seemed to be heavier handed then normal in getting the moral across.  On top of this, the two songs weren't especially memorable.

This isn't to say I didn't like the video.  The lessons on sticking by your friends and treating them well are important and the stories are fun.  Kids, the true audience, should love it.  This one just won't be as popular with the adult fans of the series.",1142985600,26,2696,4.598739495798319

2480180,4,B000E1JP10,My son is crazy for VeggieTales. But this is one of those who bring issues that are related to classic movies. For me the best of the collection are those who speak of biblical stories. But this still brings a good message.,1308268800,,223,4.333333333333333

2480182,2,B000E1JP10,"To be perfectly honest, I have tried to watch this with my daughter 2 times, and we have never made it past the first half.  By the time we get to the ""Sheerluck Holmes"" portion of the episode, we have lost interest and moved on to something else.

So far my daughter's favorites are: Lord of the Beans, Lyle the kindly Viking, and A Snoodles Tale!",1274313600,,348,4.257575757575758

My kids like the stories.  But I do Not like a seller that does not say it is a DVD and sells you a bad dvd.  I had not time to contact the seller, I have 3 kids and not time to do that.",1269561600,,362,3.5443037974683542

2480185,5,B000E1JP10,"All Veggie Tale's are superb.  They teach morals and you never have to be ""afraid"" of the content.

The imagination shown by the creators is excellent, and entertaining to all ages.  Some of the humor is so subtle, it makes you smile that you weren't expecting it.

They are great.  And children love them as well.",1252713600,2,314,4.535714285714286

2480198,5,B000E1JP10,"We have all been guilty of taking too much credit for something we didn't do alone. This story is a reminder that we should not overlook the value of true friendship. Sheerluck learns that a true friend cares for his friends' feelings. The title gives it all away. We have to treat one another as you would want to be treated.

Your child will learn the important lesson to think about others feelings first. This is a very important lesson for toddlers. Especially when they are going through the ""it's all about me"" stage. Next time you need a reminder of how to treat others, just pop this story in. You won't be disappointed.",1209168000,,629,4.517543859649122
2480199,3,B000E1JP10,"While I am usually a huge fan of Bid Idea and VeggieTales, this one went way  over my kids' heads.  Don Quiote?  Come on!  And while Sheerluck was funny in a slap-stick sort of way, there was too much going on visually to get the whole plot.  Okay for kids 8 and up, but not for the little guys.  Try instead the older VT movies like Dave and the Giant Pickle or The Toy the Saved Christmas.",1186704000,6,391,4.012987012987013

2480201,5,B000E1JP10,"I didn't love the La Mancha skit on this one. Neither did my children. However, we REALLY loved the silly song and the Sheerluck Holmes portion of this DVD.

They are entertaining, witty, light and a perfect quick watch before retiring after a long day!  Always a great and thought provoking message to end your day with.  By the way, KIDS LOVE them TOO!  Even though some of the humor is over their heads, but we old folks can relate!",1168819200,,455,4.5
2480203,4,B000E1JP10,The stories and characters should be enough to make the Veggie Tales series one of the best.  Yet I'm constantly irritated with the amateurish voices.  It makes me appreciate real actors and their voice creations.  Still the story carries the movie and the kids don't mind the irritating voices.  Sheeluck is clever and I give 5 stars to the writing.,1167955200,,350,4.783333333333333
2480204,3,B000E1JP10,"Let's start out by saying that I am a Veggie Tales fan. Not a movie of theirs comes out that I don't see. And usually, it's worth my half hour. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times. The values, as always, are good, but the movie itself needed a makeover. For example, the first story, The Asparagas of La Mancha, was unrealistic in the extreme. I realize that watching a movie starring talking vegetables is not always realistic, but the use of extra-strong salsa as the reason that an asparagus goes mad and attacks a large structure? It's not selling me.

The Silly Song was a huge letdown, consisting of a boy who lives in a house and how his ball falls into the perfect ""Gated Community"". This could have been funny, but the joke ""buds"" were all completely undeveloped.

The main story, Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler, seems to make fun of the fact that Sherlock Holms got all the credit in his and Dr. Watson's cases. This could have been a humerous premise, but the lack of showing any logical or extra-observational tendancies in either Watson or Holmes, saying that Watson solved the case using his knowledge of baguettes and green cheese, was a great disappointment to a person who has loved Sherlock Holmes her entire life. Also, the making fun of the Scottish policeman, whom we have always been able to understand in the past, was a mark in the cons column for me.

All in all, the disappointment was accute and I hope that BigIdea will be able to get their act together, in light of all the excellent work they have done in the past.",1165881600,2,1563,4.535460992907802
2480205,5,B000E1JP10,"This would have to be one of the greatest veggietales movies of all times.  Of course all of them are good (I should know - we have every single one).  Sheerluck learns about treating others as you would want to be treated.  The CG work is seamless and the story is complete.  I highly recommend this for all ages.
