2061580,5,B000244F96,"This is not the best series, but if you're a Sailor Moon fan, you MUST have it. It's focused on Chibimoon and Pegasus (Chibiusa is a very terrible character). Besides, it's very slow, and the Amazon Trio part isn't interesting. But, you'll see a new transformation for all the sailor senshi, better animation and character designs. The better series are (in order of favourite): S, Sailor Stars, R, Sailor Moon (first) and SuperS.",1089676800,3,430,4.904109589041096
2061581,5,B000244F96,Sailor Moon is awesome this version is good they did not change too much when they did the dubbing for it,1304294400,,105,4.0476190476190474
2061582,1,B000244F96,"For any true Sailor Moon fans, you know that the Japanese subtitled versions are the way to go.  This DVD is advertised as Japanese/English with English subtitles.  The DVD menu even has the options to choose Japanese language and English subtitles, but neither are truly available.
The voice actors are terrible compared to the original Japanese ones, there are many cut scenes or delete episodes, so it is not truly the ""Special Uncut Version.""
However, if you have watched the dubbed English versions from the beginning and can stand the horrible voice acting, I'm sure you'll find this just lovely.
I know nothing of the plot yet, so I can't comment on that, but I have already purchased the original Japanese version to watch.",1296345600,5,731,4.887096774193548

2061585,4,B000244F96,"... is not my favorite season. In fact it is my least favorite. After the heart snatcher season this one just did not have the plot to live up to the name that sailor moon was making. If this season had been better, the show may have continued, but after this season aired on t.v. the show was cancelled. Is that a surprise? It is a must have if you are collecting the entire sailor moon series however. Even though the plot is sort of bad, there are episodes that are worth watching in this season.",1243382400,,499,4.208333333333333
2061586,5,B000244F96,"Not the best as far as story lines, but easily one of the funniest seasons thanks to Chibiusa and Usagi. I was so happy to be able to find some of the seasons. I would recommend it for any Sailor Moon fan!",1231977600,,205,3.9047619047619047
2061587,4,B000244F96,"Great Season, DVD Menu's Were Kinda Lame, Quality Wasn't As Great As It Could've Been, Hate The Dub Version So The Dual Audio Is Great! Geneon/Pioneer Did A Horrible Job Of Dubbing The Voices Are Just Awful, The Only Good Thing They Did Was Keep The Original Japanese Background Music, Besides That Watch The Japanese Subbed Episodes Theyre So Much Better, If Your Used To The English Voices Once You Adapt You'll Love It Soo Much More!",1230681600,,436,4.675324675324675

2061589,5,B000244F96,"I remember watching Sailor Moon when I was a kid. When I was watching Sailor Moon on YouTube it brought back alot of memories from my childhood. I loved all of the Sailor Scouts is Sailor Moon,Sailor Mercury,Sailor Mars,Sailor Jupiter & Sailor Venus that they fight against evil for love & justice especially from the Negaverse. Sailor Mars & Sailor Jupiter's powers are my favorites. Serena always made me laugh on the she is such a crybaby & so clumsy. And I also like the Handsome Tuxedo Mask who always save the Sailor Scout whenever their in danger. I would like to get Sailor Moon DVD & start my own Sailor Moon Collection!!!!",1193875200,,632,4.601769911504425
2061590,5,B000244F96,"The first Sailor Moon DVD I bought was from the SuperS Season (although I had been a Sailor Moon fan long before that lol).  I instantly fell in love with the series.  Although it is not as great as my favourite season (Sailor Stars), it's definitely fun to watch.  I did not buy this Boxset, but bought the 7 DVDs individually.  The original Pioneer Released DVDs have really nice Reversable Covers, a mini-poster, and the terrible ""Geneon Signature Series"" banner is not present.  5 out of 7 of my DVDs for this season are indeed Pioneer Versions.  The 2 I bought as Geneon Signature Editions are quite disappointing.  The quality on those discs seem a bit less than the others (often, a red shade is visible on black backgrounds during the show).  However, I believe the quality on this boxset is as good as the original Pioneer editions.

Although the Outer Solar System Soldiers are not present in this season, SuperS is still a great season.  The animation is by far the best of the series in my opinion (next to Sailor Stars) and you can definitely see that in the vivid new attacks of the Sailor Senshi.  This boxset is definitely worth the buy :D",1153267200,,1155,4.558252427184466
2061601,5,B000244F96,I absolutely LOVE this seaon of Sailor Moon. It was both funny at points and extremely sad at others. Once I was done watching it I started all onver again. I truly enjoyed it. Thank you,1128297600,17,186,4.194444444444445
2061602,4,B000244F96,"For some reason, a lot of the English-language voices have changed since the first season.  Serena's voice-actor really overdoes it.  But otherwise, this is some of Sailor Moon's best stuff and at least Sailor Jupiter's voice never changes.  Great bang for your buck, pick this one up for some good times for you and your Sailor Moon loving girlfriend before Geneon's license expires and you have to pay twice as much for this one on eBay. :)",1123891200,16,442,4.714285714285714
2061603,5,B000244F96,"I've watched this anime before and planning to buy it some day (hopefully it won't go out of stock).It's a good anime with good message. Luv the powers (girly yet powerful, girlpower as Geri Halliwell might say haha) and the customes. If you watch Sailormoon since Classic then you'd see how much Usagi's grown up into a fine and brave young girl aka soldier. My advice: collect Sailormoon's DVD sets including this one.",1123113600,10,420,4.767123287671233

2061605,5,B000244F96,I've been a huge Sailor Moon fan since before I can remember.  Personally my favorite seasons as the first and second and I've been wondering when they'll have a boy set out for those in english.  Other than that this is a great buy for any who love Sailor Moon.,1104192000,3,262,4.22
2061606,5,B000244F96,"Of all the Sailor Moon seasons, SuperS and StarS are my favorites. If you're not a huge fan of Chibi-Usa, this season may get on your nerves, but it has the best drawing, awesome new attacks and transformations, great music, and interesting villians. A must have for all true-blue Moonies.",1099785600,,289,4.8
2061607,5,B000244F96,"THE AUDIO IS IN JAPANESE OR ONLY IN ENGLISH??? AND THE SUBTITLES OF THIS BOXSET ARE IN ENGLISH TOO??' PLEASE SOMEONE HAS BOUGHT THIS BOXSET TELL ME ABOUT IT, THANK YOU !!!!",1098921600,,172,4.40625
2061608,4,B000244F96,"The SuperS series is the fourth of the five Sailor Moon series. It mainly focuses on Chibi-Usa, or Sailor ChibiMoon, and a winged horse, known as Pegasus. It's basically the story of a group of enemies known as the 'Dead Moon' trying to find Pegasus, who is hiding in somebodies 'beautiful dream'.
 The series is very repetitive, where in nearly every episode, the Dead Moon will choose a person who they believe is hiding Pegasus, attack them, and look into their dream. Conveniently, the Sailor Soldiers have recently become friends with whoever is targeted by the Dead Moon, and they show up to save the day.
 The series does have some good points. All six of the soldiers featured in the series gain new 'super' forms, with brand new costumes, attacks, and powers. The animation, character design, and music has also improved. However, there are many problems. There are no appearnces by the Outer Senshi, who are by far regarded as some of the best characters in Sailor Moon. Also, the series is very light-hearted compared to it's predecessor, Sailor Moon S.
Overall, Sailor Moon SuperS is still part of one of the greatest Anime's of all time, and is not to be missed.",1090108800,47,1175,4.754901960784314

8021815,5,B000244F96,"I love Sailor Moon. Sailor Moon is a Japanese Animated cartoon about a a girl named Serena, an klutzy yet good hearted fourteen year old girl, who discovers one day through a chance encounter with a talking cat named Luna that she is a superhero. Sailor Moon. Shortly afterward she receives a cosmic brooch and shouts out Moon Prism Power. She transforms into Sailor Moon, champion of love and justice. Through different trials, she fights the dark kingdom.  Although initially scared, over time she finds real power within herself and a sense of purpose and banishes evil. The series ran for five years and has inspired people of all ages to keep fighting for love, hope, happiness, and a safe future. Over the course of the series, Serena discovers who she is and she becomes an empowered female hero. Along the way a group of girls come into her life;  Amy, Raye, Lita,  Mina,  They are also superheros, 'Sailor Soldiers' who each represent a different planet. Sailor Mercury. Sailor Mars. Sailor Jupiter. Sailor Venus. They become best friends and corner stones in each others lives.
 In the show each girl has a journey as an adolescent. Searching for their dreams. Their identities. Their individual place in the world. Sailor Moon celebrates the journeys we all go through. A beautiful gift Sailor Moon shares is letting viewers know that they are not alone in the world. What is great about the series is that it celebrate the themes of trust, support, friendship, empowerment. Another amazing attribute the show has is its depiction  of the heroes journeys. The girls overcome tragedy, heartache, death, rebirth. When all seems lost, the sailor soldiers embrace their destinies as heroes and find strength, and inspire themselves to keep fighting evil. Together they overcome evil and save the world. Sailor Moon is a life changing series.

What I like about this season is that it shows the girls lives outside of being sailor soliders. It was great to see them having fun. It was nice to see Rini (Chibi-usa) experience her first love. The closing arc is also very exciting. I won't spoil the ending. But I will say this, what you realize is that Serena truly loves Rini and has a close connection with her that is beautiful to watch.

Sailor Soliders thanks for being my role model!",1363219200,,2294,4.834183673469388

8021817,5,B000244F96,This is someone to look up to--and the Japanese version is the best you could ask for.  Sailor Moon is one of the greatest female heroines there are.  She is definitely my hero!!!!!,1354579200,,181,4.454545454545454
8021818,4,B000244F96,"Sailor Moon SuperS is the fourth season of the Sailor Moon series. It is also the last season to be dubbed in English. Personally, out of all the seasons, this is my least favorite. In this box set, about 5 out of 7 discs have barely anything to contribute to the plot. Most of the episodes are the same; the Sailors meet a new person, the enemies target that person, the Sailors fight the enemy off and the episode is over. I would say the plot doesn't actually develop until the 6th disc. Many people say this was the last season in English because it was so terrible (which it wasn't), but the real reason is because Cloverway's license over Sailor Moon ended in 2004, which is why the 5th season never got dubbed. I spent about $120 on this box set, and I am very pleased with my purchase. Like I said, not my favorite season but it does have some really awesome episodes! Any Sailor Moon fan should save up their money for this! (:",1352851200,5,936,4.293785310734464
8021819,5,B000244F96,"I was a little girl when sailor moon supers aired in Japan but couldn't watch half of this season's sailor moon because my parents decide to move back to the US. While the dubbed voice of sailor moon is annoyingly bad it grows on you. It also helps that Rini/Chib-Usa's voice dubbed is cute. I loved everything about this edition, and squealed with joy knowing they had the original subtitled. I would definitely reccomend this to any fan out there, but if you want to test out what you're getting you can rent from Netflix first like I did. Oh and FYI, there is another season after supers. It hasn't been dubbed yet but it's called sailor moon stars. If its ever dubbed I would just want younger voice actors.",1332201600,,711,4.476923076923077
