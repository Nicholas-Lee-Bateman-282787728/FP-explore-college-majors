6284945,5,B001TOE8GS,"What a beautifully conceived, insightful, deep and haunting film!  There are so many levels and layers to this gay cinematic gem that one viewing will not be enough.

Whether viewed as a young man's struggle to find himself by connecting to those inner parts of himself, or rather as a spiritual journey that untimately helps him find truth and hope, this film speaks on several levels and languages.  For those who have found themselves at rock-bottom and life almost too much to bear, this film will resonate and remind us all that truth is always within us and with us, and that recovery and restoration are always grounded in love and redemption.",1277510400,6,650,4.785714285714286

6284947,3,B001TOE8GS,"I will not be another redundant hack by repeating the film's description.  I consider this film in the non-traditional or experimental catgory of a young man with an inner turmoil.  Yes, the actors are goodlooking and sexy, whether one concludes the lead character is gay, bisexual or just mentally/personality challenged.  If you want a linear storyline with a story arc (along with R-rated sex scenes) then spend your money elsewhere.  If you enjoy the challenge of a psychological/mystical/existential drama with haunting, visual imagery and very creative film editing all in a non-choronolgical time line, then you will find this a wonderful film to own.  But this may require repeated watching to 'uncover the layers'.  For all the artistic qualities of this 'concept film' this one is not for the masses...but for the few who do, you will highly appreciate watching.",1270339200,14,872,5.192857142857143
6284948,5,B001TOE8GS,"Not your typical indie film - A film with an unconventional narrative structure, A film that is not driven entirely by dialogue, A film that relies on the visuals to tell the story.  This is what PRAXIS represents, and the echos of Kubrick and Bela Tarr.

Synopsis:
If you could be anywhere, where would you be?

PRAXIS, the debut feature film frm director Alex Pacheco, peels away the layers of narrative even as Brian (Tom Macy), the film's axis, struggles to create his true self.  Brian, a writer on the verge of a breakdown, is aided by Joe (Andrew Roth) and an Elusive Woman (Regina Aquino) as he sifts through the fragments of his persona to discover his true core.  Fighting against fear and the indifference, his quest reflects the classical mythos of Proteus and the human search for meaning in the universe.

Featuring music by Bob Massey and Transcona.

6284967,3,B001TOE8GS,"I liked reading the reviews and seeing what everyone got out of the movie good or negative, because I got a totally different opinion. I don't agree with the comments that this movies about sexual identity choosing masculine or feminine.
As most of us have, we've lost someone we loved. It caused stress, anxiety, questions, paranoia, trouble at work, etc. Seeking help from a doctor getting scripts and then analyzing should we take them, should we not? Having the constant struggle to dig ourselves out while we seem to continue getting deeper and deeper or simply being ""stuck.""
Joe to me was the side of him that was honest, out going, insightful, kind, compassionate, loving. The main actor longed for that but wasn't ready to work on it or change. He wanted pills or advice for an easy way out. The female role didn't speak as much. She was elusive and shy. Maybe the one making him seek help through pills and alcohol.
The first time watching the movie I thought it was a gay, straight struggle until the end of the movie when each character stated, ""I am you."" Reading the comments about the movie while watching the movie a second time I tried to watch it identifying the masculine/fem reviews and his choices but again at the end of the movie both characters state they are him which makes no sense with gender identity.
I feel the movie showed a visual aspect of heartbreak and one looking into themselves and asking how they're going to solve it. Being strong not taking drugs and alcohol, asking ourselves questions about what we want in life and where we want to be. Do we want run/walk out of the door (in the painting or through the doorway with light on the other side) or do we want to take the drugs and mask the issues choosing to be quiet elusive and remain ""numb"" until we've decided to change.
The issues I had with the movie were the chronological order making it hard to follow the proper steps (as someone going through this same situation masking heartache with drugs) and having to watch the movie twice to understand what's needed to be done and what the movie was about. I didn't understand why the Asian man was in the movie. And as someone who knows nothing about astrology or Greek history the only positive aspect was the visual imagery.
Choosing two very good looking men I think was crucial to keep ones attention through the movie without an actor we all know. The nudity scenes were raw and shouldn't have meant to be gay or pornographic as Joe is him. Confusing me making me think it was a movie choosing gay or straight. The two characters should have kissed as the female and him kissed but making out distracted the meaning of the scene. Loved the scene! But didn't have to do with the movie.
Joe was outgoing, positive, insightful and more, and I know a lot of feminine individuals with those qualities. Therfore I didn't understand the gender identity reviews.

That, however, is actually quite effective in instilling a profound sense of empathy and the sought-after feeling in the audience.  The reason I have to give five stars is because of the last 15 minutes -- the lake scene and the ensuing white space scene, which I found to be emotionally overwhelming -truly stellar performances by both actors.  Andrew Roth radiates powerful and captivating personal qualities through his character Joe -  A comforting and confident inner-strength and tranquility, an amazing level of loving and tender sensuality.

6284991,2,B001TOE8GS,"First, I have no idea why people think this is a gay film. You really can not tell if the two named characters are lovers.
As best I can figure, the film is about rambling last thoughts in a dying mind. There is no plot, purpose, reason, inner story. There is no way to assemble a time line to understand this. The chapter numbers being out of sequence is merely a joke on the viewer. The film is worth watching, but only if you just have nothing else to do. This film splits its personality every few seconds.
You may ask who am I to write such things. I am you...after you watch this thing.
My only real dislike for the film is that the main character is searching for help, and he goes to a doctor who throws a prescription at him like it is an antibiotic cure. Then Joe, assuming he is a real person, totally dismisses the need for medication.",1399766400,2,847,4.2024539877300615
6284992,4,B001TOE8GS,"Tom Macy's performance as an indecisive, depressed, and frustrated writer is amazing.  He is a beauty under wraps, trying to emerge from the amorphous chrysalis stage by writing his way out. The director has a rather Sadistic purpose, getting the viewer to FEEL into the character's compulsive desire to control his environment while being increasingly isolated.  Depression leads to prescription drugs and all of the so called side effects.  If you have ever had to deal with the suicide of someone who took an antidepressant in their teens or early twenties, this film is gut wrenching.  Unfortunately all too true, and I had to revisit that territory.  I am grateful to the director for this experience and the story line, which stresses the possibility of choice and different outcomes.
From a Jungian psychoanalytical perspective, this film is excellent.  Brian, the main character, is the conscious personality, the ego.  The inner Shadow, Joe, and the elusive woman (the anima) are projected out onto real people and Brian isn't sure what he wants or who is real.  The choice makes all the difference and integration of the self is the process exhibited here.  The boredom and stuckness, the frustration and indecision are painful to experience and the feeling of fragmentation is created on purpose.  I can see why the ordinary viewer would hate this film.  It is too close to reality!
This is an art film, not recommended for superficial viewers who want a clear story line to follow.  This is more like a choose your own adventure book with several possibilities.  A psychotherapist would love this film, I did.",1399766400,5,1621,5.003731343283582

The plot was awful, the acting was superbly awful and the direction was awful.  I don't even think this movie would be nominated for a Razzie because it was that bad.  So I ask the question...Does it take an A-List actor to make a gay film?  Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, the Late Heath Ledger, the gorgeous Jake Gyllenhaal, John Leguizamo, the Late Patrick Swayze, Antonio Banderas, the dreamy Timothy Olyphant, Leonardo DiCaprio, Wesley Snipes, the Late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who I had the pleasure of knowing before he hit it big) and on and on have played amazing gay characters with zeal and conviction.  And even some A-list gay actors have gotten it right...I guess that's why they are A-list gay actors.  As for gay indie movies it's like we only have Broken Hearts Club A Romantic Comedy, Trick and All Over The Guy...I'm sure there are others, but they escape me at the moment. The rest just seem to suck...although I did laugh at Not Another Gay Movie and The Boys In the Band truly showed the bitter queens as they really are. I understand many A-list gay actors don't want to play gay for obvious reasons to me...and I can see how a straight actor would love the challenge of a gay role.  I just wonder why we can't get straight or gay actors to make great INDIE films...except Benjamin Bratt who did The Mission and it was FANTASTIC...although he did not play gay...he made a great indie gay film.

it is true that this might be hard to follow and might seem slow and lack a plot and development of characters and i believe that is only in the surface.  if you look deeper into the film you will find what i believe is the fundamental struggle every human being goes through in their lives.  who are we as an individual?  which side (feminine/masculine) do we identify with?  which one do we feel comfortable with?  and unfortunately, we also struggle with the ""definitions"" society labels us with.  you act too masculine therefore you  are an alpha (in a man totally ok on a women is butch) or identify yourself as hetero or homo and you are viewed differently and expected to act a certain way.  step out of the label/box and your sense of identity can be skewed to a million little pieces if you allow it.

I take from this film the struggle we all go through to find ourselves and the consequences and situations we all (individually) consider to be our rock bottom and what we are capable of doing to ourselves when we believe to be alone and that the only numbing solution to our ""unsolvable"" problems are drugs/alcohol/cutting/suicide and anything that can gives a (fake) sense of control over our lives.  we all want to be loved, we want to belong, to care and matter to someone and when life gets tough and no one (weather we believe we have someone or not) is there to catch us the desolation can be heartbreak",1390435200,3,1596,4.351351351351352

6285008,2,B001TOE8GS,"Best advice, rent it first, like I did.  After reading the description listed on Amazon, I thought this would be a very stimulating movie based on symbolism and a philosophy of action based creativity that built identity or expressed man's deepest nature, but the reviews were so bad, I decided to delay the purchase and rent it first.  Smart move.

Even symbolism needs a structure, and the producer of this somewhat banal film fails to put much of what he is saying into any kind of context, so the symbols just sort of fall flat.  The imagination is left groping for a meaning.  His reluctance to use dialogue hurt his endeavor; it could have given the film's symbols (some of which are still opaque to me) a context for meaning.  Affectivity is an important part of symbolic interaction, but the acting and scenery produce largely a flat aspect in the viewer and prompt only questions rather than an expanse of the mind.  The ham-handed use of a television interview half-way through the film to answer the growing questions in the mind help with the viewing experience, but the sudden inclusion is jarring and moves the mind to a rational process that the use of symbols is suppose to supplant.  In short, it fails to do what it is suppose to do.

There are some interesting philosophies that could have supported the theme of action and identity formation--Blondel's Action Theory, the Neo-Confucianism of Wang yang ming, some aspects of Buddhism and Taoism, Romanticism--but if he uses any of them, I missed it.  Fragmented identity and the need to seek wholeness seems to be the pulse of the film, but it is a theme at least as old as Saint Augustine, and the arid use of contemporary psychology does not have the same dynamic as The Confessions.

In a more positive vein, the film makes some interesting use of ""science footage"" that reveals the cosmos, though the symbolism is a bit off.  Tom Macy is shot in some interesting ways with light which is aesthetically pleasing.  The nude scenes are very natural.

8644517,2,B001TOE8GS,"This movie really tried hard to be an existential journey of self-acceptance.  When I finished the movie however, I was thinking what the frick was that all about and why did I just waste 93 minutes of my life watching this drivel.  It was poorly scripted, badly directed, and had the editing of a high school film club students first project.  It also had a preachy prescription meds are bad theme but all I kept thinking was how much better this movie would have been if I was on a heavy dose of prescription meds or stoned.  I couldn't help feeling bad for the actors as I have a feeling when they saw the final cut they were thinking what the frick too.  Truly the only reason Im giving this movie two stars is because of the actors.  They deserved better.",1526688000,,760,4.3546099290780145

8644520,3,B001TOE8GS,"In some ways, I really liked the film because it explored the story of a troubled young man who finds himself. Touching, tender moments are present. In other ways, though, it was striving for depth that didn't quite materialize. The movie randomly repeats the same scenes as a way to force the viewer to acknowledge their importance (the cover photo of the two naked men hugging is one example). As soon as I read ""an elusive woman"" in the description, I figured it was going to be something weird. And it turns out that both the man and the elusive woman are just other manifestations of the protagonist. Behold the depth.

Far removed from its cousin, the Klingons' key energy production facility, the movie was basically writing checks that it couldn't cash. (And now they're probably coming for my gay card.)",1514937600,2,812,4.75886524822695
8644521,1,B001TOE8GS,"Why did I suffer through this pretentious twaddle? Why did I think that this film would suddenly shape up and offer anything resembling a coherent story line, a clear intent, something? I guess it's that there was just enough --- a good looking protagonist, an attractively tattooed secondary character, but in the end, no matter how much I hoped, it still felt like watching ice cubes melting.
