4375026,5,B004H0ZH20,"I loved this series when aired on PBS years ago.  It's the reason that the latest PBS show ""Downton Abbey"" is so popular.  This was the beginning of the understanding of the lives of ""below stairs"" people in England right after the turn of the century (1900)  It follows the families of both so-called classes of people and how diverse, over-priviledged or poor they still had similar experiences.  Most of all, how they handled these life problems.",1359072000,2,449,4.792207792207792

4375029,3,B004H0ZH20,Can anyone tell me if this collection has closed-caption specifically English subtitles?

4375031,5,B004H0ZH20,"Other reviewers have thoroughly described how wonderful this series is...so I will not need to do that.  Let me just say that, after reading that PBS would be airing a new, follow-up series to the original Upstairs, Downstairs, I decided that I needed to refresh my memory of the original.  I was a bit shocked to see how much it would cost to purchase the full series, so I decided to start out by purchasing this DVD of season One.  Believe me, it was a wise decision.  Viewing this wonderful first year of the series was enough to bring back all my memories of the two wonderful groups of people chronicled in this timeless drama.  And there are 6 hours of bonus materials!  If, like me, you are on a somewhat limited budget, I suggest you purchase this DVD before watching the new series...it was worth every cent!",1302393600,8,818,4.493243243243243
4375032,5,B004H0ZH20,"Stunning in costume & set detail. Shows life of the working class (Downstairs) as they serve the aristocratic (Upstairs) Bellamy family. Led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson) the classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel for years 1903 to 1909. Series Two, also available, is 1904-1910.
Series 1 has 13 episodes introducing cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between classes. Great plots in every episode. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Some topics were quite daring in the 70s. This is huge Emmy earner drama that went on for 5 series. The 40th anniversary Edition, ""Upstairs Downstairs Series 1-5"", is now available and the economical way to buy the saga.

Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) with heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman, times being yet horse and carriage. They seem to become your family.

ALL episodes have SUBTITLES and a very sturdy, compact case for the 4 discs. Bonus of 56 min ""Making Of."" The pilot was remade after a 70s technician strike, and in color. An alternate pilot episode is also included. Of the 13 episodes, 2,3,4,5, &7 are B/W due to the strike. All others in color, including pilot.

After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After ""Upstairs Downstairs"" the pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Eliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama.

Upstairs Downstairs is as addicting as scones and tea. A MUST-SEE, but I really recommend looking at the 40th Anniversary Edition. Spend less, enjoy more, and that 68 50-min. episode set has 25 hrs of Bonus. Divide dollars by hours and you'll find it a value.",1296950400,30,2543,4.976470588235294
4375033,5,B004H0ZH20,"Probably the greatest TV series ever to be made in England, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" takes place in the early 1900's and follows the lives of the rich Bellamy family living in a posh area in London. The drama unfolds as the Bellamy's lives are intertwined by their servants who live ""downstairs"" in an elegant and beautiful mansion.

 Like most soap opera the writer's of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" realized that if you pit the working class against the jet-set drama will unfold and great television viewing will ensue.

 In ""Upstairs, Downstairs: Series 1"" 13 episodes are included and run approximately 50 minutes. The first six episodes were shot in black and white with subsequent shows filmed in color. However, it is believed the first show (the pilot) has been wiped, so an episode shot in color was made.

 Debuting October 30, 1971 on England's ITV channel, most North Americans discovered the serial through airings on local PBS channels and cable's A&E netowrk during the late '70's and 1980's while viewers north of the border in Canada watched via the CBC.

 This box set is also available with the entire series housed in ""Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series-40th Anniversary Collection"" that contains over 25 hours of addition new bonus material.

 The series has been revived on the BBC as of late 2010.",1295395200,10,1320,5.013761467889908

4375042,3,B004H0ZH20,"I was excited to get this DVD and popped it into my DVD player almost immediately. I was very dissatisfied overall. After watching Downton Abbey, I half expected this to be similar. Even if it IS similar, the quality of the DVD or, perhaps, the original recording, was very disappointing. Sadly, although I love this genre, period and so forth, this is not one of my even close seconds.",1385942400,,386,4.608695652173913
4375043,5,B004H0ZH20,This is one of the best British television series of early 20th century British life and joys. I strongly recommend that others need to buy the complete series. We have access to all five seasons and we are on our seconding viewing of all five seasons. Outstanding acting from the entire cast and fine writing and directing.,1385510400,2,324,4.701754385964913

4375051,2,B004H0ZH20,"Okay, I am a Downton Abby fan - admitted.  I have also enjoyed the modern remake of Upstairs Downstairs and enjoyed it very much.  So, I thought I would venture back in time and watch the original inspiration for the remake.  Oh it was painful to say the least!  Yes, it is an older creation, but I was not quite expecting the poor acting that I encountered.  I tried to give this every chance to redeem itself, but each episode just seemed to get longer and the acting worse.  If you can suffer the flat acting it might be possible to appreciate this series for the vintage piece that it is - I was not able to do that and I returned it to Amazon on their Buy-Back program because I knew that I would never finish watching it.",1366848000,,727,4.194244604316546

8429212,5,B004H0ZH20,"I watched this show after having been exposed to Downton Abbey 4 years ago. If you liked Downton, you'll enjoy Upstairs Downstairs. Downton was based on this 1970's series, so there is a lot of similarity and comparisons that can be made. UD is dated, for sure. It's a lot more primitive than DA, with somewhat slower plots that have fewer things/drama going on at the same time. The characters, though, are equally captivating to those in DA, and the vibe of UD is somehow more innocent and calming. DA is a high-energy British series, with a slightly modern take on the early 1900's. UD takes a more reserved, basic view of the same time period, so the show comes off as a little slower but more old-school somehow.

I would definitely recommend this to any Masterpiece Theatre/PBS/British television fans, and for sure to those who like DA! A++",1519603200,,847,4.684563758389261

I didn't remember a lot of it and I read something that said  there was material that hadn't been on TV before so maybe that's it.
