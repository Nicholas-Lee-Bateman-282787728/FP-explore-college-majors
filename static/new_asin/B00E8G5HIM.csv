8602457,1,B00E8G5HIM,"Didn't watch the whole movie due to the characters saying the word ""SLUTS"" so I definitely do not recommend this!!!",1426204800,,115,4.8

8602459,1,B00E8G5HIM,It doesn't let you watch it for free. It would be better if it let you watch it for free once a day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1396051200,,146,5.391304347826087
8602460,5,B00E8G5HIM,"The only problem is the movie didn't come out 2013 it came to TV like in 2005, or 2006 I believe. The only thing on the DVD from 2013 was Bratzillaz. Idc what all the negative ""feedbackers"" have to say this movie is kid appropriate just like any Disney movie you let you child(ren) watch; if they're taught common-sense. (yeah Ik this isn't a Disney movie but y'all know what I mean) I watched cartoons that were mature for my age when I was little, and had way more than someone getting punched in the stomach, and have not mimicked the cartoons stupid/outrageous/nor violent actions.",1390435200,2,585,4.580952380952381
8602461,1,B00E8G5HIM,"I am all for living in the real world. But this movie is nothing short of disgusting. These characters beating other characters, kicking them in the stomach after dragging them by their hair and pushing them down the stairs. It's HORRIFIC and will Never be seen in our home again! Kids emulate. I don't know how any parent who actually watched this movie would approve of it's content.",1390435200,3,385,4.676470588235294
8602462,1,B00E8G5HIM,"This movie is terrible. From oversexed toddlers to shallow, mean characters this movie has nothing I want my granddaughters to see, much less emulate. I am sorry I purchased this movie at my granddaughter's request before checking it out.",1389657600,5,238,5.128205128205129
8602463,5,B00E8G5HIM,For the first time the bratz actually fight the villain its normally run away it was refreshing to see them do these things,1389052800,2,123,4.391304347826087
8602464,5,B00E8G5HIM,My granddaughter loves this movie and watches it everyday. Monster high is her favorite right now. Shes aiming to get each doll.,1388534400,,128,4.863636363636363
8602465,5,B00E8G5HIM,My little baby girl saw this and fell in love. I had no choice but to find a way to make up for some of the stuff we have lost. I will not ever afford to replace what we had but this will make her smile.,1384819200,3,203,3.4347826086956523
