8609064,5,B000B9WF08,Johnny Stockman drew the animations for this great and fun way for young children to learn about fire safety.  He really needs the credit that he deserves as he doesn't profit from this DVD at all.  I just thought that I would mention this as his name is not mentioned in the description.,1326153600,,288,4.415094339622642
8609065,5,B000B9WF08,This DVD is exceptional and covers all of the bases in regards to fire safety.  Every parent should have a copy of this DVD in their collection.  It entertains and educates children at the same time.  It's also a great tool for Fire Educators.  I recommend it highly!,1127952000,2,267,4.5

Amazingly, my picky children LOVE Firefighter Frank and I love them watching it, with all the violence and fluff on tv it's nice to know I can sit them infront of a DVD that will be educational and what they think is fun!",1126483200,2,287,4.433962264150943
