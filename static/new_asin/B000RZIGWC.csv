2877046,5,B000RZIGWC,I have 2 girls and a little 2 yr old that i babysit and they love this movie. We have 3 different Dora movies and this is their favorite one. My 2 yr old Daughter loves the songs and loves to sing along with them. And a major plus is that its pretty long. Just long enough for their attention spans and not too short that i have to keep listening to the same songs over and over again,1193616000,18,384,3.8734177215189876

2877098,4,B000RZIGWC,"In my opinion the Dora videos/stories are appropriate for children in preschool.  We don't allow our 3 1/2 year old much screen time, but when we do, we like that the Dora videos depict positive situations and she's bilingual.",1396051200,2,226,4.794871794871795
2877099,5,B000RZIGWC,"Dora the Explorer has been around for 14 years - but she is still a small child curious about the world. Here she explores the world of fairy tales - with success! My daughter adores mermaids - and this story was yet another homerun in the series. A-dora-ble Dora is allways a great gift with toddlers provoking their imagination and observational skills. As my daughter pointed out: ""The walk of a mermaid - is CRAWL!"" ;0)",1395792000,2,423,4.578947368421052

2877103,5,B000RZIGWC,"As always, I like the positive messages in Dora. This one deals with friendship, taking care of the earth, and helping those in need. As an adult, I have a hard time watching Dora but my 5 year old loves is and I like the messages.",1388102400,,231,4.043478260869565

2877105,4,B000RZIGWC,"This movie kept my daughter busy during our last trip and she enjoyed the story line.  She is now bored of it, but considering she has watched it about 100 times, I think we got our money's worth.  We share it with our friends and it is something we didn't have a book or toy of so it worked out great as something new she could call her own.",1381536000,,342,3.9420289855072466

2877110,1,B000RZIGWC,"I bought this movie as a streaming video and the quality was terrible (as of this writing, 15 May 2013).  What's more, my two year old daughter found the whole thing boring and fell asleep twice watching it.  I watched for a few minutes but simply couldn't take it.

2877115,5,B000RZIGWC,"I actually like Dora for my kids. Its not ""scary"" it does not have good vs evil themes with villains. It does not have romantic themes, and is generally pretty innocent with no bad attitude or anything I wouldn't want my kids to pick up from a TV show or movie.
I also do catch my kids saying a few spanish words here and there. And this particular one does appeal to my daughter who is really into mermaids right now.",1355097600,,418,4.172839506172839

2877118,1,B000RZIGWC,"My 6yo daughter had been haranguing me to show this to her for months. It's one of the double-episodes not available via Netflix, and I had run out of excuses to avoid spending a couple of bucks, so after she'd been particularly good and asked nicely one more time, I bought it.

Around the halfway point of the first episode my princess lost interest, and she repeatedly turned down the chance to watch the second part and find out how this epic turned out.

So, um, thanks, I guess, for ridding my household of the Dora plague?",1352073600,3,529,4.443298969072165

2877125,5,B000RZIGWC,"The Dora DVD's are a lifesaver. If my little ones need a break from running around, I can be sure they are learning something by watching Dora. In fact, when my 2 year was learning to talk, she actually used the Spanish word for jump before the English word. We do not speak any Spanish in our household and she learned this any many other things from Dora.",1322438400,,357,4.264705882352941
