1830682,4,B00008973P,"While planning my trip to Iceland this April, I stumbled across a mention of this film and decided to check it out, mostly for the scenery of Reykjavik.  However, this ended up being a thoroughly entertaining film.  The story line, while somewhat unconventional, made for great comedic highs infused with all the emotion of the complicated relationship between the main characters.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of foreign or independent films.",1092528000,2,467,5.038961038961039
1830683,5,B00008973P,"What do you get in a coming-of-age movie when the leading character is 30 years old?
Lets just say you get an excellent movie, where the comedy is driven by the way of life of a slacker in the small and cold town of reykjavik, iceland's biggest city. The drama and motif in the characters rise when Hilmir finds out he's just gone to bed with his mom's partner.
It's a great funny story of similar to films brought by Spanish director Almodovar, without the dramatic gloom and heavy atmosphere.
And to top it off it features and excellent music soundtrack, by Damon Albarn of Blur, which is also a great buy.
All in all, this film is definetively a must see.",1089763200,,658,4.401639344262295
1830684,4,B00008973P,"Set in the Icelandic capital 101 REYKJAVIK follows the life of underachiever and slacker Hlynur: he's unemployed, in his 30's, and still lives at home with his mother. What's more, he has absolutely no ambitions for his life, hardly gets up before noon, and loves porn. He certainly didn't have good role models; his absent father is a drunk and his mother smokes hash with him. At first I don't have any sympathy for Hlynur, but there's something about his interactions with the other characters that kept me engaged to keep watching. There are indeed some very funny scenes that certainly made me laugh out loud. As the story progressed I couldn't help but be drawn into Hlynur's predicaments, pathetic as they seem. Though most scenes were filmed indoors the cinematography of Reykjavik and the surrounding areas was gorgeous. This film was entertaining and funny. Recommended.",1082505600,,880,5.034246575342466
1830685,3,B00008973P,"I've seen many Foreign Films lately, and I've noticed that most of the ones I've seen are extremely simplistic, and focus the entire story on an average character and his/her daily routines.
The problem with this movie is that the main character is an underachiever, and his life is less than entertaining. True, a character's life CAN be boring, but the story can't.  A dull life and dreary routine can make for a good movie (i.e ""400 Blows""), but for the movie to succeed, it's got to be shown in an entertaining way.
I seriously felt swindled out of $20 by the time the credits rolled.  There was nothing fresh about this movie at all.  The characters were not intriguing to say the least.  And just looking at the scenery was sending me to an early nap.
And so, visually, this movie also disappointed me: all the audience gets to see of Iceland is the main character's house, a Welfare office, a nightclub, a bazaar, and a few shots of apartment interiors.  If there was more scenery in this movie, it didn't leave any memorable impressions.
To sum up, I watched this movie for three reasons:
1) to be entertained by the main character's lifestyle
2) to listen to the Icelandic language
3) to get a colorful glimpse of Iceland
In conclusion, the only good thing I can say about this movie is that most of it is in Icelandic.  That said, I seriously doubt anyone will be enthralled by the movie's story.  And people hoping to see Iceland or even just Reykjavik in all its glory will be disappointed by the film's choice of locations.  The movie does not do Iceland justice, and it does not do the movie industry justice.  At its very best, this movie is less-than-average.
Aside from this movie, I've only see one other Icelandic movie, ""The Sea.""  And if you have to pick between ""101 Reykjavik"" and ""The Sea,"" I definitely recommend the latter.",1079827200,4,1849,4.575757575757576
1830686,4,B00008973P,"I mean, a movie set in Reykjavik, Iceland???
Well, it's terrific, and filled with some of the most hilarious, memorable lines ever to come from the screen. My personal favorite was: But I've never cheated on my mother before!
101 Reykjavik focuses on the life of a chronic welfare recipient who lives his depressed life with his mother in a small apartment where the bathtub is 3 feet from the kitchen table. Enter: another woman, but both mother and son want her. Sit back, laugh, and enjoy this film of urban angst and aimlessness.",1057363200,17,533,4.680851063829787
1830687,4,B00008973P,"Somehow, even the spaced out layabouts of Iceland are appealing in this film, set in the dark months of Reykjavik's winter. The main character, Hlynur, lives with his mother, provides the hash, does nothing. ""What kind of nothing?"" Hlynur's mother's girlfriend asks,and he replies, ""The nothing kind.""
Nothing much happens in the film either, but it's an interesting nothing, with a good soundtrack and curious images of the bleak winter streets and the bohemian cafes and bars of 101 Reykjavik. If you've been there, it's also fun to spot the places you know.
Mostly it's subtitles, but quite a bit of the film is in English. The sound quality seemed particularly good to me.",1048464000,5,676,4.93859649122807
7980384,3,B00008973P,"One of the oddest ""not bad to good"" films I have ever seen. Most of the film is in the Icelandic language with subtitles, but there are significant parts of the film which are spoken in English.  There is a lot of nudity, both female and male, both full and partial frontal.  I must admit that I probably would have liked it more if it did not glorify smoking (cigarettes) as much as it did, with the lead character being more than a chain smoker, he talks consistently about smoking and how much he wants to smoke, and how much he loves to smoke, and many other characters smoke too.  If I did not hate (I am allergic to the smoke and smell, it makes my throat close up, and my mother has smoked during my entire life, with no consideration for me or for others, in a way like the lead and some other characters do) smoking as much as I do, I probably would have enjoyed the film a bit more, but the concentration on smoking is a bit over done, in my opinion, almost to the point that the film seems to be in 1960s ""smell-o-vision,"" or 1980s and later ""Odorama"" (used by John Waters) or Aromavision, etc., even though it was not.  Most, but not all, of the nude scenes and sex scenes were played for laughs, to good effect, as was the lead character's ""slacker-ism,"" or disability, or unemployment, but as a few of the characters mentioned, that was getting a bit old towards the end of the film.  Again, for me, using it for comic effect hit a bit close to home, because the character in the film was clearly making it up, and was not actually disabled, which makes fun of people who actually are disabled, because they are not making it up, as I know all too well, since I am disabled for several reasons, all medical, and none made up.  But, I did actually laugh at it in the beginning, it was only towards the end that it got a bit old in the film.  Obviously, you can decide whether you agree based on your own observation as the film and story play out in front of you.  All in all, I would probably rate this film about two and one half stars, not quite a full three.",1493596800,,2075,4.209068010075566

7980391,3,B00008973P,"This movie started off really captivating, but by the middle of it I found myself no longer on the protagonist's side.  I also noticed that this movie culminated in pretty formulaically, typical of a lot of other Scandinavian films I've seen.  The end wasn't rewarding, and the basic plot ups and downs were similar to films like the Norwegian Elling - it was the same type of style, or so it appeared to me, in any case.  The soundtrack also became pretty annoying, with more than half the songs being techno versions of the song ""Lola"".

High points of this film:  It is technically very pretty, filmed well, and makes good use of scenery.  The plot is straightforward and fun.

I just don't think this film has too much substance in it.  It's good to see once but definitely isn't groundbreaking or a favorite of mine.  You should give it a try, though, if you're into Iceland.",1124323200,6,880,4.554140127388535
7980392,4,B00008973P,"2000 Icelandic not-rated movie. Also known as ""101 ehf. kynnir""  Caution: full nudity (including male, and female (and brief nudity of and older woman)), and drug use.  Something of a strange love-triangle movie.

DVD Features: Contains the film (oddly, the DVD does not specific what language the film is in, though it offers English subtitles), and special features.  There are three special features: 1: filmographies; 2: ""Trailers from the Wellspring Libraries"" (7 trailers, ""Irma Vep,"" ""Un Air De Famille,"" ""Clockwatchers,"" ""A Couch in New York,"" ""Hugo Pool,"" ""Stolen Kisses,"" and ""Venus Beauty Institute""; and 3: ""Weblinks"" (2 links: 1: a website that contains an interview with the movie's director, and 2: the Wellspring website address).

Credits: The movie stars Hilmir Snr Gunason (Hlynur Bjorn Hafsteinsson; ""The Sea""), Victoria Abril (Lola Milagros, from Spain; ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"" (1990), ""Robin and Marian"" (1976), Hanna Mara Karlsdttir (Berglind; ""Agnes""), rur Vilhjlmsdttir (Hf; ""No Trace""), Baltasar Kormkur (rstur; ""Stormy Weather""), and lafur Darri lafsson (Marri; ""Fiasco""). The writer and director is Baltasar Kormakur (""A Little Trip to Heaven"") based on the novel by Hallgrimur Helgason.

Plot: Hlynur Bjorn Hafsteinsson is a adult slacker that still lives at home and is very disinterested with moving on with his life.  Despite this dispirited drifting through life, he is able to have something of a relationship with a woman named Hofi, but even here he is a slacker and doesn't really care about the relationship.  Things change when his mother's friend drops by (Lola; a lesbian, actually she is bi).

Review: The movie opens with a close up of the main actor's face while he is having some fun with a blonde (Hofi).  Based on an early monologue, the main guy seems to be fatalistic (""dead before I was born . . . life is an interruption""; a lot of talk of death in the movie; NOTE: it is slightly harder to tell when an actor is talking in his head when you only read subtitles).  The includes beautiful shots of Icelandic landscape.  Odd, once the Spanish woman arrives, they begin speaking English with her (I don't mean that the rest of the movie is in English; Abril has been around since the `70s, and still looks great (even at around 41), even wandering around her friends apartment nude).

An interesting look at Iceland, if this movie had occurred anywhere except Iceland, it might have been a little boring, but the exotic nature of the locale kept it interesting though a rather slow movie.  Interesting music, good for the bleak snowbound world of Reykjavik.  Good acting, something of a slice of life plot, some attractive women (not all; though some are quite beautiful), some of the men are jerks (probably just the characters in the movie; apparently, the drunk father and welfare society are the main character's excuses for being a slacker).  There are some humorous moments in the film.  Overall, I would give the movie 3.85 stars, mostly due to the exotic nature of the locale.",1118361600,13,3034,5.0
7980393,4,B00008973P,"A fantastically concocted farce. A fifties-clad sexually attractive, aimless, partying nerd with horn rimmed glasses and no hindsight is manhandled by his lesbian mother and her hot blooded lover. They teach him to accept his place as father/brother at the bottom of the totem pole in the family.

For viewers/readers not familiar with Icelandic movies, many are made but few appear outside Scandinavia. Iceland has the highest litracy and readership rate in the world, and the highest rate of book publications. Historocally, since settlement by Norwegians (and some Scots) avoiding kingly rule in the 9th century, Icelanders have been a highly literate and democratic society. See the more modern books by Haldor Laxness, e.g., or Snorre Sturlasonn's history of the kings of Norway (written in the 13th century). [...]",1107907200,,820,5.3565891472868215
