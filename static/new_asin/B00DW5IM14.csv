5860095,5,B00DW5IM14,This started the asian crazy in the united states and it is a classic. The director is legendary and you should check out all his movies,1389225600,,136,4.269230769230769
5860096,5,B00DW5IM14,"I've been wanting to watch this for some time.  I loved the American remake and after watching this, I have discovered that it was surprisingly well done.  Like many of the Japanese horror movies, it unfolds slowly, and you really need to appreciate that aspect in these movies.  We do, and we very much enjoyed the film.  You really don't need all those special effects to make a very creepy film when you have the makeup, lighting, and motion down pat!",1385424000,,454,4.567901234567901
5860107,2,B00DW5IM14,"Honestly people? There is not one scary moment in this film. It's way to expository....everything is talked about, explained. The dialogue is simplistic to the point of laughable. And after all that the big payoff is that the video is like a chain letter. For those of you who are scared by things jumping out at you, fear not. None of that here. It's not even a mood piece. Someone here wrote that they had to sleep with the lights on after viewing this. This person must also wet themselves after watching the Great Pumpkin.",1439683200,,526,4.5473684210526315
5860108,4,B00DW5IM14,"Simy one of the best horror films around. If you've seen ""The Ring,"" you know the story. This is the original film of a cursed video that kills people a week after watching it.",1436918400,,176,4.205882352941177

5860110,5,B00DW5IM14,"I've seen it before and it has become a classic, own them all and it shows to you that you don't need hundreds of millions to make a good movie, this is down right and as simple as it gets, advice: to enjoy it better ""I"" prefer  to watch all japanese horror movies at night (after10pm) and with headphones to enhance the atmosphere of the movie, you gotta know that in japanese movies the audio is very important and on horror films its the thing they consider primordial as it prepare you to what you are a bout to see, with that said, get a pair of good headphones and enjoy!",1433721600,3,577,4.198198198198198

5860116,5,B00DW5IM14,"I am 34 years old and have grown up watching fantastic(and many awful) horror films.  I heard about this film when the American version was released, and i eventually saw that version, which was really good in my opinion.  However, i finally purchased and watched the original Japanese version, which is infinitely better.  The American version clearly has higher production values, and I have nothing bad to say about it, but original Japanese film is so much more interesting and generally just really something special.  I wouldn't say that its the scariest horror film I've seen, but it is certainly my favorite!  If you have any interest in Japanese horror and or Japanese culture you will probably love this film.  If you just want a very original horror film, you may also really enjoy it.  If you enjoy a strange mystery, this is for you!  The idea of the video cassette being like a chain letter seems kind of flimsy in theory, but the film managed to suck me in from the first scene and never let go.  I became nearly obsessed with this film, and I can see why it became such classic!  much of the film is based on ideas from ancient Japanese ghost stories, but to a westerner these are very new concepts and much different than the horror films i have been used to.  I watched it with a few friends who also really enjoyed it.
it was very though provoking and rather a good mystery as it unfolded.  I highly recommend this one!",1397433600,8,1438,4.5310077519379846
8598509,2,B00DW5IM14,"Its just okay, I thought this was going to be a lot better and more scary than expected, but alas, it didn't deliver! I found this movie to be incredibly boring, not scary, and ridiculous that it is considered a classic! I actually would say that if you are interested in the Ring films, then go and check out the American releases since they aren't so boring and are generally creepy! Also, as a side note, if you are looking for a Japanese horror gem, please take a look at the film ""Ju-On"" (The Japanese Grudge) as it is creepy as hell and a lot more entertaining than this film! Overall, Ringu I'd say is overrated...",1484611200,,621,4.362068965517241
8598510,5,B00DW5IM14,Never watched the American version but this version is even better I imagine and I thought it was extremely entertaining and that twist at the end (no spoilers) I'll remember for a long time to come. Easily the best character in the movie is the ex-husband but all of the other characters are just as well rounded out.,1480982400,,318,4.5
8598511,1,B00DW5IM14,"Soooo boring, and the worst acting i have seen in a whole.",1466380800,,58,3.9166666666666665

8598516,4,B00DW5IM14,"I'm probably one of the few or possibly the only one that liked the remake a little more than the original... BUT with that said... I actually thought this film was very well made and definitely a little scarier than the remake in places. Before I continue, let me say that, I saw the remake multiple times, before watching this. I am a Naomi Watts fan and the son and Samara in that film were perfectly cast. Now back to this film... The actors, locations, and vibe is great! It was fun comparing the two films, but each film has its moments. I actually like the final sequence better with Ringu, but the moment (big reveal) at the end, I prefer the American ending. Just my opinion. But overall, Ringu is a genuinely creepy film. Definitely a horror classic! Check it out with confidence!",1447459200,3,790,4.493055555555555
8598517,4,B00DW5IM14,Good copy of the film. A classic horror film - upon repeat viewings have found it to lose it's way in the middle but what an ending!,1446854400,,132,3.925925925925926
