Like the other three, it's a terrific collection, spanning twenty-two complete vintage performances, period promotional footage, television and stage performances, and contemporary interviews with Peter Noone, Karl Green (bass), Keith Hopwood (guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums - sitting in front of his awesome gold-sparkle Slingerland drum set). Noone was - and is - one of the most charming front-men of the British Invasion, and the documentary reveals the band to be much more than a backing unit for their vocalist. Their hits were often the lightest of pop songs, but written, played and sung exceptionally, and the group was a charming live act.

The group's hit singles were brought to them by producer Mickey Most, who had a golden ear for material and arrangements. Their first single, a 1964 cover of Earl-Jean's ""I'm Into Something Good,"" was a worldwide smash and followed by a string of singles, some unreleased in the UK, some unreleased in the US, that kept the group at the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic well into 1967. The unusual release strategy left U.S. audiences with a different picture of the group than those in their home country; in particular, ""Can't You Hear My Heartbeat,"" ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter,"" ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am,"" ""Listen People,"" ""Leaning on the Lamp Post,"" and ""Dandy"" were all stateside smashes that went unreleased as singles in the UK.

The documentaries' interviews reveal the unorthodox story behind the recording and release of the music hall styled ""Mrs. Brown,"" and recollections of the band's first NME Poll Winners Concert are born out by a winningly nervous performance. The group looks more comfortable with their up-tempo cover of Sam Cooke's ""Wonderful World,"" with the young Noone in his schoolboy suit playing the part of the song's protagonist. It's easy to see why he was the sort of heartthrob who induced Beatlemania hysterics in young girls. An early performance of ""Fortune Teller"" at the Cavern Club shows the group to have had a grittier R&B side that was mostly unused for their hits. The liner notes and commentary mention a hot version of Chuck Berry's ""I'm Talking About You"" that unfortunately didn't seem to make the final cut of the DVD.

The group's hits rarely strayed from polite pop, failing to navigate many of the changes wrought by the latter half of the 1960s. Their recordings of songs by P.F. Sloan (""A Must to Avoid""), Ray Davies (""Dandy"") and Graham Gouldman (""No Milk Today"") took them towards folk-rock and more poetically crafted lyrics, but even as their clothes took on the fashions of 1966 and 1967 their singles remained ""romantic, boy-next-door stuff."" They continued to record through the psychedelic era, having a Top 40 hit with Donovan's ""Museum"" (not included here) and thickening their productions with strings and a hint of country twang on ""My Sentimental Friend,"" but the heavy sounds emanating from San Francisco and elsewhere spelled the end of their hit-making days.

Herman's Hermits were a feel good band whose chipper music became anachronistic in the face of Monterey Pop and Woodstock. Their singles weren't trendsetting (though Noone suggests his over-the-top English accent on ""Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" freed other British bands to abandon their faked Americana), but they were catchy, sold extremely well, and to this day remain memorable. In addition to the 78-minute documentary, the full individual performances can be viewed via DVD menu options, and bonuses include a 24-minute concert filmed for Australian television, a commentary track, and fifteen minutes of interviews that recollect the Hermits' 1967 tour with the Who. This is a great documentary for both fans and those who only know a few of the group's hits. [2010 hyperbolium dot com]",1270425600,,4264,5.525267993874426

3893507,5,B002BEXF7I,"This DVD nicely covers Gerry & The Pacemaker's history in a way that will entertain both newcomers as well as seasoned fans. It tells the group's story by moving from modern commentary to vintage clip.

Commentary is provided by Gerry Marsden(from the current Cavern in Liverpool) as well as Mersey Beat editor Bill Harry, and fans who plan to purchase the T.A.M.I. SHOW DVD will be happy to know that this DVD doen't include any footage from that Pacemakers' performance.

Gerry's commentary is interesting, entertaining, and informative. It's a delight to watch & you'll learn a lot too.

Sure there are plenty of vintage clips that don't appear on this DVD but what is included nicely illustrates what made Gerry & The Pacemakers unique and, at the same time, inseperable from the Mersey musical scene they were unmistakably part of.

If you don't want the commentary you can just watch the musical clips(two additional performances included) and there are further extras featuring Gerry in one and Bill Harry in the other. Harry also wrote the bulk of the fine booklet notes.

I was honestly surprized how much I liked this DVD. It's great!",1269993600,20,1144,4.9067357512953365

It is a spectacular collection of footage that spans twenty-seven complete vintage performances, interviews with the principle band members reflecting on their time as seminal mod and psychedelic rockers, and superb vintage clips of the band creating in the studio, shopping on Carnaby Street and gigging at iconic clubs like the Marquee. The producers have performed miracles in digging up rare television and film footage, and archival interviews with Steve Marriott (from 1985) and Ronnie Lane (from 1988, his last filmed appearance) are complemented by contemporary interviews with Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan.

Though the Small Faces had only one chart hit in the U.S. (1968's ""Itchycoo Park""), their fame in the UK and Europe, not to mention their style, sound and musicianship, were in league with the Who and Stones. The band members post-Small Faces gigs brought a greater helping of stateside fame (Marriott with Humble Pie; Lane, McLagan and Jones with the Faces; and Jones with the latter-day Who), but this 101-minute documentary shows the Small Faces were a group to be reckoned with. Marriott was a ferocious front-man with an aggressive vocal delivery, hot guitar licks and a songwriting partnership with Ronnie Lane that matured from derivative R&B to original tunes that wove pop, rock and psych influences into their bedrock soul. The interviews trace the group's original influences, the pop sides forced upon them, and the turning points at which they made artistic leaps forward.

Among the biggest events in the Small Faces' development was a change in management and label from Don Arden and Decca to Andrew Loog Oldham and Immediate. The mod sounds and styles of their early singles quickly became psychedelic, but not before launching their new phase with the 1967 ode to methadrine, ""Here Comes the Nice."" Their hair and fashions in the accompanying television performance find the band in transition between the dandy style of the mods and the floral and flowing elements of the hippie revolution. The influence of LSD can be heard in ""Green Shadows"" and the band's U.S. breakthrough, ""Itchycoo Park,"" which McLagan suggests was a rebuttal to England's formal system of higher education. The group's pice de rsistance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ogden-s-Nut-Gone-Flake/dp/B000UNMSCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ogden's Nut Gone Flake</a>, is essayed here with a lip-synched clip of the title tune and a seven-song live-sung (but not played) set from the BBC's Colour Me Pop.

The progression from the hard R&B of ""Whatch Gonna Do About It"" to their crowning concept album is impressive, but that it happened in only three years is amazing. The story of the Small Faces is told here in the band's words and music, with interview footage woven among the music clips. The full performances, including four not featured in the documentary, can be viewed separately via DVD menu options. Lane's full interview and a photo gallery are included as extras, along with a 24-page booklet featuring detailed credits and song notes. This disc will strike a deep nostalgic chord for UK fans, and will be a voyage of discovery for Americans familiar only with ""All or Nothing,"" ""Itchycoo Park,"" ""Tin Soldier,"" and ""Lazy Sunday.""

3893509,5,B002BEXF7I,"Herman's Hermits are the most under rated band of the British Invasion. This DVD finally does the band justice. Guitarist Derek ""Lek"" Leckenby was one of the best guitarists in rock during the 60's and until his death in 1994. So much incorrest information has been published about Herman's Hermits it is nice to hear the true story from the surviving members. It is particularly nice to hear that the Hermits played on most of their records and on all their biggest hits. The DVD contains great video from the era.",1269388800,20,515,4.670329670329671
3893510,5,B002BEXF7I,"A GREAT DVD!!! An evocative watch for me, I was born in 1951 and lived in London during the reign of the Faces, for me there were them & the Stones, the Beatles and the Who were pale, middle of the road & safe compared to the boys! Only the Kinks were as adventurous, and you could argue they burnt out quickly too.

Who else could produce Ogden's Nut Gone Flake and belt out soul like this? Take risks like these and have so much fun doing it? They say if you remember it you weren't there, thank god this reminds me.

If you buy one DVD this year, buy this and hear where ""Whole Lotta Love came from.",1269388800,14,602,4.050420168067227
3893511,5,B002BEXF7I,"This DVD is absolutely brilliant! Really, you need know no more - just go out and buy it - you will not be disappointed!

If you want to know more - it is how all music reviews of a band should be made. Band members are interviewed and provide fascinating insights into how the band was formed, how the music was written and the message behind the songs. Interspersed, are full clips of the songs themselves - all their hits plus the Ogden's songs in colour (the other clips are in black and white). The beauty here is that if you do not want to listen to the interviews between the songs, you can just select ""play songs"" and you will get the song clips playing one after another - the best of both worlds. There are also extra interviews, including a touching one with Ronnie Lane some time prior to his untimely death.

So, as I said, get your copy now and join the many ""in the know"" who have had endless pleasure from watching this DVD. (It is one of a series of four [Gerry & The Pacemakers, Herman's Hermits and Dusty Springfield being the other 3] - lets hope there are lots more to come). This company ""does it right"".",1269388800,23,1127,4.286384976525822
3893512,5,B002BEXF7I,"This is a keeper and it probably includes most of the video footage of Small Faces. Loved the archived interviews with Steve Marriott (1984 and 1985) and the shots of Ronnie Lane during his last video'd interview in 1988 (one year before I met him at a Rolling Stones' concert). I almost forgot how much Lane sang lead vocals in this band, particularly in the color footage. The contemporary interviews with Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones were great, too. I laughed out loud when McLagan talks about how they were as good as The Who live, probably around 1965 or 1966 - he's probably right. McLagan says that by the time Small Faces toured with The Who in Australia - I think it was around 1967 - Small Faces were past their live-performance peak, and were overshadowed onstage by The Who. I had always heard that Marriott didn't want to tour the U.S. when he was in Small Faces because he lacked confidence in his guitar playing, but McLagan talks about how a manager in England selfishly kept the band away from the U.S. Marriott must have lacked some confidence (it's silly, he was great on guitar) because he wanted to bring in Peter Frampton as a second guitarist, which McLagan, Lane and Jones quickly vetoed.
It's a great DVD that also allows the viewer to watch the live and mimed footage without the interspersed interviews.
We need to see more of these on other deserving bands like Mott the Hoople, Free, Faces and early Bad Company.",1268697600,20,1442,4.614785992217898
3893513,3,B002BEXF7I,"I saw this DVD popping up in my ""recommended"" releases and wondered what exactly it is since there's not much of a description here or anywhere else online.  A friend bought it for me for my birthday (Thanks Jess!) and now I can reveal the mysterious contents of this strange DVD!

First off, there are a total of six ""short films"" on this disc.  The first four are actually 8mm ""digest"" versions of full-length films.  These ""digest"" releases were made back before home video, so people who had their own projectors could watch their favorite scenes from feature films-- they're basically highlight reels.  The four ""digest"" films included here are: ""Let's Get Laid,"" ""Adventures of a Private Eye,"" ""Adventures of a Plumber's Mate,"" and ""Adventures of a Taxi Driver.""  The other two shorts are more along the lines of 8mm stag reels: ""Three's Company"" was shot by George Harrison Marks and stars Val Jones, and ""Academy Adventuress"" is just a striptease by a lady named Robin Starch.  Also included is a ""slide show"" which is around 5 minutes of stills from all the programs on the disc set to music.  That's pretty much all that's here-- you've got an option to watch all the shorts in a row or choose which one you want.

I don't think any of the full-length films are available on R1 DVD, so this might be your only way to get a look at them if you don't have a region-free player.  This disc is an interesting little ""sampler"" of British sex comedies of the 70s, and it's cool to see what scenes made the cut for the digest versions, but aside from the novelty there's not much to recommend unless you're curious about the films or already a completist!",1259020800,6,1658,4.589830508474576
3893514,5,B002BEXF7I,"Listening to Peter Noone and the other members of the Hermits discuss the songs of their career (and then hear the songs) is so wonderful and gives me great feelings of nostalgia.  The best part is hearing Noone discuss his own performances, and watch how much he looked like someone's ornery little brother who had sneaked onto the stage and sang a song (and bounced his knees in time to the music).  I laughed at him so much, it was a wonderful experience.  The music was as enjoyable this time around as it was when I originally heard it in my teens.",1498089600,,553,4.401960784313726

For those vaguely familiar, this is the band who did Itchycoo Park in 1968 as part of their fourth and hardest rocking album Ogden's Nut Gone Flake. If you liked that tune, there were many you never heard, and will here. Damn good live songs throughout, from all of their first five albums.

Wonderful video, from the old days to new, and super LIVE VERSIONS of S.F. immortality, like Song Of A Baker - and it was played GREAT live. Saw much more clearly how Ronnie Lane was as much of the impetus to further S.F. songwriting as Steve Marriot, and maybe it was Lane who pushed them into what some historians have called the ""first hard rock"" on Ogden's.
See Ronnie go nuts late in a jam with Marriot, his hands moving like lightning up and down his bass neck, on a cool sounding hard rock riff of Marriot's..

Super good.",1465689600,,945,4.262569832402234
3893523,5,B002BEXF7I,"This is just my opinion but I believe this is one of the greatest Rock movements of all time The British Invasion where the impact is still felt today. Even now with all the new rock bands coming out they are influenced by these rock giants. The reason being is this was the cream of the crop the best of the best when they arrived on American shores they changed the musical landscape forever and the rest of the world would never be the same. I think that Herman's Hermits were sorely underrated and left to blow in the winds of forgotten. If you hear anyone mention them they're used as a cruel punchline to fill in someone's joke than what contribution they provided for the rock/pop world. I believe it's because the songs that they threw out to the world a bit cutesy too much pop not enough edge I would have to agree about their songs are a little more pop laden than rock however if you listen to the vocal arrangements the harmonies are quite stellar and they were excellent musicians so there was a lot to appreciate with this fearsome five. Some of my favorite songs from them were A Must To Avoid, You Won't Be Leaving, If You're Thinking What I'm Thinking,Can't You Hear My Heartbeat, and No Milk Today which I love The vocal harmony structure on these great hits this DVD showcases them beautifully. Got A Feeling which is not included on this DVD is one of my favorites this great classic showcases the more Rock side of the Band that we don't get to hear very often from this underrated Rock/Pop Band. The Lead solo that Lek plays on this unappreciated classic is bad ass which proves that they could have done more Rock laden material if they so chose to do so. No Milk Today was another great classic that shied away from their happy, feel good classics that they were putting out at the time it was a introspective on life love found and love lost and the vocal arrangements were superb the harmonies were just beautifully done. My Sentimental Friend was another great classic it had a more mature feel to it and had a bit of a haunted sound to it as well which I loved. I believe this band had more to give and could have done more Rock material if given the chance and had a little bit more patience to stay the course. I love this DVD as well Reelin In The Years does a fantastic job of covering these great bands I hope in the near future they will put out more of these great bands such as The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, The Searchers, The Zombies, and Billy J Kramer and The Dakotas.

3893525,5,B002BEXF7I,"Behind only The Beatles, Gerry and The Pacemakers were absolutely  the best of the ""British Invasion"" groups, at least in my opinion. Similar to the Dusty Springfield disc, this one suffers no lack of lip-synching. But when they do play live they are a treat to watch and hear. Gerry's personality all these years later is as charming as it was then. As he points out, when he wrote and sang ""and here I'll stay"" in Ferry Across The Mersey, he was not kidding. I wish he would have brought us current on the whereabouts of the Pacemakers, but all things considered this was a pleasurable walk down memory lane and I loved it. Becoming a teenager in 1963 put a fellow in the cat-bird seat for a lot of good music.
To truly appreciate these guys, listen to the Beatles version of How Do You Do It on Anthology, and compare it to what Gerry and company did with the same number. Granted, the Beatles only wanted to record their own material, and it shows in every listless note of their version. I am grateful to them for the opportunity they passed on to the second band out of Liverpool that Brian Epstein signed. Gerry proved out to be a quite worthy songsmith in his own right, but was smart enough to see a hit song when it was handed to him on a platter.",1462060800,,1257,4.326271186440678

I won't be purchasing any other DVD's in this series.

It's perfectly directed and conceived, balanced, informative, full of stuff we never knew and crammed with AMAZING performances. And frankly it would be worth it just for the hilarious and heartbreaking interview in the extras with Ronnie Lane.

Second, the greatest value of this DVD is that it demonstrates what a GENUINELY PHENOMENAL BAND THE SMALL FACES WERE. Too many  Humble Pie and Faces fans sometimes regard the Small Faces as a lesser band of the three, just a little pop group, and we perhaps think of them only in terms of some quirky psychedelic (Itchycoo Park) or good time (Lazy Sunday) hits... but these guys were a tough as nails, hard rockin' quartet. The only reason we Stateside generally don't appreciate this fully is because we never got to see them live. Whereas I can tap into my memories and FEEL what it was like to see Humble Pie and the Faces, each of whom I must have seen at least a dozen times, each time leaving soaked with sweat with a big grin on my face.

And of course there's the ultimate bottom line to this DVD, which has now become a cliche it's so true... and that bottom line is...

Heavy hitters like Rod Stewart and Ron Wood acknowledge that Lane was the heart & soul of both the Small Faces, and the Faces ... and Peter Frampton is on record saying that Marriott was his favorite vocalist !

This DVD is a portal into a time when rock & roll was fun, creative, & edgy, and it laid out the foundation template for what was to become the golden age of rock ... and influenced the talented artists that followed in the '70s & early '80s ...",1340582400,2,801,4.34

If you want to see and hear them in their prime before the later hits (Itchycoo Park and the Ogden's album tracks), then this is for you as the latter years get short treatment here.

What makes this DVD so awesome is the fact that the shots are pristine and the interviews with Gerry and other people around at the time are so informative you feel like you are in London or Britain with the group themselves.
Towards the end of this masterful production Gerry talks about what made each Pacemaker special, and why they broke up.  He claims they didn't keep up with the times, they were lazy and just didn't want to deal with the business anymore.  After watching this I was a little heartbroken because they were so talented they could have easily gone into the 70s with their peers like the Animals, and the Hollies.  I guess this group was like the Searchers, and Billy J Kramker and the Dakotas they are one of the forgotten groups of this wonderful genre.

At the time of my writing this review there are six reviews which cover most everything pertinent, but I did feel compelled to add my own thoughts as well as ditto the comments others have generously contributed.  I can't say enought about the production of this DVD.  Reeling In The Years have made a true textbook example of how to profile a rock band here.  I've never seen a better put together set and the fact that Herman's Hermits were actually great musicians performing their certain kind of lighter rock in such a fantastic way really rises to the top.  There is even a true, albeit compact, concert here in very good sound and sight that I would have never guessed even existed!

Perhaps the first rock record album I ever purchased myself was one of the MGM Herman's Hermits Greatest Hits collections.  I was about in the third grade!  This music spoke to my young mind.  It helped start me on a lifelong love of music as defined by my own tastes which only grew outward.  This DVD helps me to realize that I wasn't just a juvenille with no music sense because this stuff is still fun to listen to over 45+ years later.  If you like me grew up, but forgot how good Herman's Hermits really were, run, don't walk, to buy this DVD because it is truly the best, plus you'll learn more than you ever could have guessed about one of the most fertile periods of rock music extant.",1303171200,3,1645,4.446666666666666
3893584,5,B002BEXF7I,"The entire ""mod"" scene can be traced, more or less, to the band which America got so little knowledge of at the time: The Small Faces.  This video documentary serves to right that ""small"", really large, injustice.  The Small Faces were, I feel, the birth of the mod scene that in America The Who were more the face of.

Where to start?  A good place is Steve Marriott.  Steve was brash and loaded with talent that belied his stature.  Add to that his band mates which were more than up to the task and you have what should have been one of the greatest bands of the British Invasion yet, in American at least, remain a somewhat obscure footnote.  I say this because like many I came on board when these guys had already called it day and what surfaced was Faces with Rod Stewart replacing Steve Marriott.

""All Or Nothing"" serves to document the loss we as Americans endured as this was one of the first truly groundbreaking great British Rock and Roll bands.  I am somewhat amazed that someone, namely the BBC as well as others, had the foresight to document in video form this group when, at least in the U.S., video and music was pure novelty.  There are some really fantastic performances with surprisingly good sound here.  I must say I am delighted with this video.  It sheds tremendous light on a time when some of the most original rock ever was created by a truly overlooked band.  Everything here works.  The narration isn't at all obtrusive and serves the music without overly analyzing it.  I've had a double CD Small Faces collecion for years and now, I must say, I can appreciate it so much more after viewing this great document.

Like Velvet Underground and Big Star perhaps the public at large missed the big pictureat the time, but so many bands in the wake of The Small Faces were formed in their umbrella that the importance of this stuff is hard to comprehend.  This video serves to correct that and as such is very enthusiastically recommended.",1278115200,4,1966,4.5397727272727275

Back in those days, I never really thought about how they sounded live, mainly because I couldn't hear them, above all the screaming! However, last night when I watched this DVD, I finally heard how incredible they really sounded live, and can now appreciate their music even more today.
It was wonderful to see all the surviving Hermits interviewed, and I loved hearing their stories, especially the ones about their adventures touring with the Who.

This opens so many more doors to their talents. Steve Marriott shows why he influenced so many musicains with his powerhouse vocals, guitar & songwriting skills. Ronnie Laine also shows his considerable influence on the songwriting & vocals. What a team! This band ROCKS!

Half of these late 1960's videos are new to me, but the real treat here is the [almost] all live TV performance of side 2 of Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake!! Priceless. I'm so glad this exists. This was the Small Faces entry in the psychedelic 60's competition & a fine entry it is. It's right up there with ""Their Satantic Majesties Request"", ""Magical Mystery Tour"", or ""On The Threshold Of A Dream.""

The other great thing about this DVD is you can watch the documentary or just play back the performances depending on your mood.

You must remember that this was recorded in the 60's & the video [or audio] quality is not up to current standards, but the historical significance of the Small Faces performances far out weighs these short comings. The band shines through.

P.S. Ronnie Laine, Kenny Jones & Ian McLagan became Faces [with Rod Stewart & Ronnie Wood] when Steve Marriott left. Steve went on to form Humble Pie.",1274832000,4,1475,4.614503816793893
3893591,5,B002BEXF7I,"""Small Faces - All Or Nothing, 1965-1968"" (British Invasion series)
(Reelin' In The Years, 2010)
-------------------------------------------------------
This DVD, available either as part of the fab, gear ""British Invasion"" box set, or on its own, is a fascinating look back at one of the great British Mod-rock band, The Small Faces, a powerhouse rock group which came in the wake of the Beatles and Rolling Stones, and rode the wave of the British Invasion straight into the vibrant psychedelic/acid rock era. The film mixes new interviews with fab archival footage and can be watched either with the interviews included, or just viewing the complete performances drawn from TV and concert appearances and other film sources.

In their later incarnation, the Small Faces became notorious for their hard-partying ways, a tendency that was already apparent in their early years. Of the four profiles in this series, this one deals the most honestly with the issue of drug use, with various bandmembers speaking candidly about smoking pot, doing speed and tripping on LSD, and how that effected their music and their careers.  There is also a charming look back at the high-flying fashions of London's fabled Carnaby Street and how the boys in the band spent all their salaries on dressing to the nines.

The group was also very adventurous and dynamic musically -- the contrast between them and the other bands profiled in this series (Herman's Hermits, Gerry And The Pacemakers) is profound: some British bands followed in the pop-oriented footprints of the Beatles, others pursued the harder, bluesier style favored by the Stones, Yardbirds and the Who. The Small Faces were clearly in this second camp, mixing tough, chunky rhythms with wild reverb and distortion. They were wilder, saucier, tougher and more devil-may-care -- cheeky young hooligans, and proud of it. Most of all, they were stylish and cool... very, very cool. Well dressed and more at ease with the dynamics of live rock'n'roll as a party music style, the Faces rode a wave of success, but clearly didn't care about showmanship or well-groomed professionalism in the same way as the tamer, more pop-oriented bands. Their live performances were about forging a sweaty, primal connection with the crowd, not about looking wholesome and nonthreatening so that their records would sell well in ""respectable"" society.  The Small Faces didn't want respectability, they wanted an explosive, immediate, liberating release; perhaps more than any other of the major, iconic English bands, the Small Faces represented the wild cry of a British youth that was tired of boredom and restraint, and just wanted to cut loose and party down.

Of the profiles in this series, this volume has some of the most compelling footage (these guys were sexy and wild) as well as one of the strongest narratives: the Small Faces didn't just ride the wave of popularity and fizzling out, they were brusquely chewed up by the music business, spat out and yet soldiered on, still rocking on. Their mix of boyish insouciance, pure joyfulness and tight, groove-laden rock provided a template for future Britpop bands such as Oasis and Blur, and here they are seen at their brash, youthful peak. The contemporary, old-geezer interviews are uniformly candid and enlightening, with none of the should-have, could-have, would-have nostalgia that often accompanies such productions -- these guys lived hard, had fun, and are unapologetic in their appraisal of their past triumphs and trials. And, man, did they look cool: the performance footage is uniformly awesome (including some of the most egregiously halfhearted lip-synching ever recorded on film... man! were those guys stoned!) A great rock'n'roll document!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Music)",1274659200,4,3792,5.228618421052632

(Reelin' In The Years, 2010)
-------------------------------------------------------
This DVD, available either as part of the fab, gear ""British Invasion"" box set, or on its own, is an fun, nostalgic look back at one of the key bands of Great Britain's 1960s pop scene. It mixes new interviews with fab archival footage and can be watched either with the interviews or just viewing the complete performances drawn from TV and concert appearances and other film sources.

For many years, Herman's Hermits were the second biggest British pop band, after the Beatles, and their bright, perky formula has proved very durable over the decades.  Innocent, cheerful, hook-laden hits such as ""I'm Into Something Good,"" ""Can't You Hear My Heartbeat,"" and ""Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter"" remain as charming today as they were back then, and even novelty numbers such as ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am"" weather the years better than one might imagine. For American audiences, this video collection offers something that most fans probably didn't have at the time, a chance to see the Hermits in person, performing with all the sparkle and charm they could muster. Lead singer Peter Noone is simultaneously goofy-looking and intensely charismatic and very, very English.  Long, lanky and quite attractive despite his prominently snaggletoothed smile, Noone embodied the British ability to transform gangliness into suavity, with the self-confidence of a culture unswayed by homeliness but buoyed by the success of its youth, after years of wartime and postwar austerity.  Although Herman's Hermits were not as artistically deep or as ruggedly bluesy as many of their contemporaries, they still embodied the optimism and exuberance of the era, and this video is an excellent way to explore their music.

I have always been a fan of Gerry and the Pacemakers and am even more so now.  What they did in the time frame in which they did it is extraordinary.  Not interested in developing away from what they started with, they remained true to themselves to the end.  Gerry Marsden was a unique vocalist, a fantastic songwriter (""Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying"", ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"", etc.)
and really accomplished guitarist.  The group's skills honed in Hamburg, Germany along with the Beatles resulted in a true supergroup whose statistics in the British pop charts have never been exceeded.  I strongly recommend this DVD!",1274400000,,801,4.932835820895522
3893594,5,B002BEXF7I,"""Gerry & The Pacemakers - It's Gonna Be All Right: 1963-1965"" (British Invasion series)
(Reelin' In The Years, 2010)
-------------------------------------------------------
This DVD, available either as part of the fab, gear ""British Invasion"" box set, or on its own, is an endearing, nostalgic look back at one of the key bands of the early 1960s ""Merseybeat"" scene. It mixes new interviews with marvelous black-and-white archival footage (including a remarkable performance at a mammoth New Musical Express concert) and can be viewed either with the interviews or just viewing the complete performances drawn from TV appearances and other film sources.

Gerry & The Pacemakers were perhaps the biggest commercial success to come out of the early Liverpool/British Invasion scene (other than the Beatles, of course...)  They scored several chart-topping hits, and had a nice way with a catchy melody.  In contrast to the Fab Four, who made it all seem so easy, the Pacemakers looked like one of the most hard-working bands in the world -- it was decidedly effortful, but also immensely charming, in no small part because of the band's innately British homeliness.  In a 2009 interview, lead singer Gerry Marsden cheerfully recalls how one fan, at the height of the band's fame, came up and thanked him for making ""ugly"" people look cool... And indeed, like many British stars of the time, Marsden was pretty geefy-looking: that's part of the charm, as he throws himself body and soul into every twee tune he belts out.  The Pacemakers mainly played safe-sounding rock'n'pop, but they were a tight band, and Marsden had a delightfully imperfect voice, accentuated by a relentlessly upbeat stage persona.  Fans will luxuriate in these vintage performances, and students of pop culture will appreciate the glimpse back at the teen scene that the Beatles came out of, and a sense of the caliber of the other bands on the scene at the time.  Ultimately, when rock went psychedelic the Pacemakers weren't able to change their style and keep up with the times. But the Beat hits and sweet ballads they recorded when they were at the top of the pops stand the test of time -- this documentary is a worthy tribute to a perky, significant band.  It's a fun film; if only every band of the era could be so well served. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)",1273104000,2,2346,4.982097186700767
3893595,5,B002BEXF7I,"If you are a true fan you will be better off buying the box which not only contains Herman's Hermits but also the Small Faces, Dusty Springfield and Gerry and The Pacemakers.

WHY?  because you get an extra DVD with that set which has even MORE HH videos (including their performance of Bus Stop and a couple of positively wonderful interviews from the 60's)  The bonus Disc also has many more Dusty tracks and another 20 minutes with Peter Noone and more time with Gerry Marsden and other contributing performers... SO....I'll say the reviews on this DVD are spot on.  Its well done from all angles and in fact so fun, you have a great documentary with clips and interviews, you may also just watch the clips(even more of them) without interviews or WITH commentary...and more bonus interview footage. This is a solid value for money for fans of the groups in question.  If you have interest in the other performers get the box set. If not try and buy the individual DVD on ebay as it has crucial bonus footage of HH.",1273104000,7,1018,4.540983606557377

Of the four artists profiled (which also include Dusty Springfield, the Small Faces and Herman's Hermits), Gerry & the Pacemakers might seem the most lightweight. But like all of the artists in this series, what U.S. audiences saw were just the tip of a larger artistic iceberg, and this collection of seventeen vintage musical performances and interviews, television and stage appearances, and contemporary interviews with Gerry Marsden and Bill Harry (founder of the Mersey Beat newspaper) tells more of the band's story beyond their oft-anthologized hits. The Pacemakers emerge as early exponents of Liverpool's beat rock, and an act that vied with the Beatles for the seaport town's music fans.

The parallels between the Pacemakers and the Beatles are many. Both were Liverpool bands with Skiffle roots that turned to covering American R&B. Both honed their live performances in demanding Hamburg gigs, played the Cavern Club, were managed by Brian Epstein, wrote some of their own hits, were produced by George Martin, starred in their own film (Ferry Cross the Mersey), toured America and appeared on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. The Pacemakers' music wasn't as edgy as the Beatles, and Marsden never really varied from his smiling, sometimes hammy, showmanship as a front-man. The group broke in 1963 with ""How Do You Do It?"" and ""I Like It,"" and crossed the Atlantic the following year with ""Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying."" Their earlier U.K. singles would find later success in the U.S., though ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and ""I'm the One"" (#1 and a #2, respectively) remained UK-only hits.

The group was on the front-lines of the British Invasion, appearing in the 1964 T.A.M.I. Show, but like many of their peers, they never really evolved. Their success in the UK tailed off in 1965, they charted their last single in the States with 1966's ""Girl on a Swing,"" and disbanded a month later. Unlike the Small Faces and Herman's Hermits volumes, this film provides little documentation of the band's musicians, and few details of their time in the studio or on the road; this is more a nostalgic pass through their catalog (including a nice anecdote about ""Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying"") than a revelatory document of the band's history. In addition to the 72-minute documentary, the full individual performances can be viewed via DVD menu options. Bonuses include additional interview footage with and extensive liner notes by Bill Harry. [2010[...]]",1272844800,8,2942,5.729977116704806
3893597,5,B002BEXF7I,"The Small Faces were my favourite band when I first became interested in music. The first record I bought was Tin Soldier. I'd hardly ever seen video clips of their songs except for Lazy Sunday. The clips are brilliant. I love the live performance of the Happiness Stan tracks with Stanley Unwin. I've got pretty much every song from the dvd on vinyl and it was great hearing the songs again and actually seeing the band performing them. It reminds me of how good a band the Small Faces were and how good Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane were as song writers. It's a pity there weren't more interviews available with Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, but the Kenney Jones and Ian McLaglan interviews were very interesting. Overall, the whole program was brilliant.",1272240000,4,760,4.7218045112781954
3893598,5,B002BEXF7I,"Herman's Hermits get a bad rap. I always thought their hits were twee, until I once saw live footage of ""Henry VIII"" so fast and intense it sounded like Punk. This disc will turn a lot of heads around, too.

The Hermits were actual teenagers singing for teenagers, in the tradition of Brenda Lee, Lorrie and Larry Collins, and Frankie Lymon. It sold records but hemmed them in with coy, marketed hits. Here you see the bigger story with sharp interviews and solid songs. Like raw footage of their energized take on soul chestnut ""Fortune Teller"" in the Cavern Club as green kids, followed by the stunning color and stylishness of ""I'm Into Something Good"". A breakout surprise is the clear, smart leads of guitarist Derek ""Lek"" Leckenby. A bonus feature is a 24-minute Aussie concert that puts you right into the British Invasion experience: an intimate theatre full of screaming teen girls, budding moptop boys, flung streamers, stage-dive kissings, and jet-age R'n'B. A sweet time trip in itself.

From that set, ""Listen People"" shines out. It is gentler, moodier, more adult, and oddly ironic in its plea. Clearly the Hermits should have been allowed to grow with their audience in that direction. That's born out by the closer ""My Sentimental Friend"" ('69), where Noone's voice is as inviting as his expression seems resigned. Other stand-outs are ""No Milk Today"" and ""There's A Kind Of Hush"", which Beat fans know for John Paul Jones' great arranging and playing, and ravers like ""A Must To Avoid"".

Threading the disc are hilarious interviews with all the Hermits, including their insane tour of America with The Who. Noone particularly has a funny, self-deprecating, insightful, and wistful charm that puts it all in perspective. Expand your Britpop palette, this is a must to have.",1272153600,,1789,4.956666666666667
3893599,5,B002BEXF7I,"""All Or Nothing"" is right; The Small Faces gave it their all and got little back to show for it. But here you finally get it all and it's all good!

Unknown to most Americans, The Small Faces blasted a swathe through 60's Britain that resonated from The Who to Led Zeppelin, from the Mod scene to Psychedelic Soul. It was still echoing in both Punk and the Paisley Underground, reverb-ing on into many Britpop bands: The Sex Pistols covered ""Whatcha Gonna Do About It""; Paul Weller and The Jam reincarnated as them to spark the Mod revival, as would Oasis again later.

The early band had fierce energy that used R'n'B like an attack. The raw footage from their Marqee Club debut crackles with threat and verve. They were as brutal as The Who and even better dressers. Steve Marriott's full-throttle gutbucket blues growl opened the door for every Rod Stewart, Joe Cocker, and Robert Plant after him. Their interpolation of Muddy Water's ""You Need Love"" as ""You Need Loving"" is the crystal clear blueprint for Zep's ""Whole Lotta Love"".

They made the arc into Psyche with textural songs like ""Itchycoo Park"" ('It's all too beau-ti-ful') and ""Green Circles"". Their mastery of the studio led to kaleidoscopic songs that reward deep listens. Their masterpiece was ""Ogden's Nut Gone Flake"", which is represented here with a walloping nine song extravaganza, narrated by the hilarious cockney surrealist Stanley Unwin. These guys were also fun and funny and it shows everywhere. New and archival interviews with everyone pace the disc with great insight, laughs, and some regrets.

The Small Faces were done in by those twin evils of Rock, drugs and managers. They didn't tour America and their catalog was lawyered off the radar for decades. But all that changes with this powerhouse disc. Get the band who gave their all. Here comes the nice, baby!",1272153600,6,1845,4.86624203821656
3893600,5,B002BEXF7I,"Gerry And The Pacemakers reset the bar for the British Invasion. Their Beat music was a blast, but when ""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying"" and ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"" haunted the radios, it stopped you in a trance. Gerry's great voice was destined for moody ballads with graceful builds. Panoramic but personal. No wonder his cover of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" became a stadium anthem moving global crowds to this day.

But Gerry Marsden also rocked and this terrific disc proves it. The energy and melodies of ""I'm The One"" and ""It's Gonna Be Alright"" are as contagious as anything from ""A Hard Day's Night"". His astute taste in American platters sparkles through ""A Shot of Rhythm and Blues"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"", and ""Skinny Minnie"". And of course Merseybeat faves like ""How Do You Do It?"" and ""I Like It"" are here to shine. A special revelation is the rollicking piano of amiable Les McGuire, putting the roll into all that rocking.

Between clips the personable and funny Marsden quips anecdotes about early British rock, the Reeperbahn scene, The Beatles, and the Mersey explosion. Also, Liverpool music scholar Bill Harry gives us the big picture. Gerry caps it off with a 2009 solo performance of ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"" at the Cavern Club that tops the disc like a cherry on ice cream.",1272153600,8,1297,4.76
3893601,5,B002BEXF7I,"The Small Faces were one the greatest bands of the 1960's, if not of all time.  Sadly, due to horrible mismanagement and bad timing, if one knows them at all in the United States, it's usually through their hit single, Itchycoo Park.  Which is a good tune, but they were so much more than just a one-hit wonder.  In fact, the depth and breadth of their material, as well as the sheer volume of outstanding stuff they recorded and released is staggering, especially when one considers the short period of time they were together (just over three years) and their youth (the youngest was only 16 when they formed).

This DVD cannot make up for their lack of exposure in America of course, but trust me when I tell you it does help right a few wrongs.  It nicely weaves full videos (which you can watch stand-alone if you choose) with interviews that tell the basic tale of a truly magical, electric, eclectic little band.  Unfortunately, there is not enough quality life footage of the band to go around, but the filmmakers make good - and sometimes creative - use of what is available.  For me, the Colour Me Pop Ogden's material alone is worth the price of admission.  There's much more to be heard of course, and if you didn't know the band well before, you'll want to hear it all.

My one criticism is the very limited amount of interview material from the late songwriting team, Marriott and Lane.  There is one sweet, heartbreaking interview with Ronnie Lane that is presented in full as an extra, but only brief snippets of interviews with the amazing Steve Marriott.  There has to be more out there somewhere; they both lived into the 1990s.  McLagan and Jones were key players and both have very good memories for details, but the lack of input from Ronnie and Steve is keenly felt.

All said, this is a must-have for anyone interested in 1960's British rock music and culture.  And if you are already a Small Faces fan, you may want to buy two.  Just in case you lose one.",1271289600,4,1980,4.522471910112359
