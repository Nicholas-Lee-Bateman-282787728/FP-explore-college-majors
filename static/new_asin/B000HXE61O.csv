8142175,2,B000HXE61O,"I wasn't much of a fan after watching this dvd.  In fact, I got so bored with it that I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  It had some decent information in the interviews; however, they are so lengthy it felt like the interviewee was rambling on.  They should have edited down the final footage to eliminate the monotony.  It did have some classic hot rod footage, which I found interesting, but the rest of the video seemed so low-budget and dated.  I was torn between two and three stars, wishing I could give it a 2.5.  However, having to lean toward one or the other I only gave it two stars.

It does a great job of providing the origin of the 1932 Ford and how it came to revolutionize American culture through hot rodding. Plus, it offers amazing classic footage and interesting interviews with prominent figures in the industry.",1394582400,,1150,5.568965517241379
8142176,4,B000HXE61O,Nicely done look back at teh roots and some of the main players of early hot-rodding. It does show some shots from 2006ish car shows that will date it but all in all it was a very good show and well worth the price.,1281744000,,215,3.909090909090909
