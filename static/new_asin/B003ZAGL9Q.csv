8410084,5,B003ZAGL9Q,I like this video a lot. when you are riding your indoor bike you feel that you are actually riding in the PA Dutch Country. The scenes of Gettysburg are pretty good too.,1519689600,,170,4.181818181818182
8410085,1,B003ZAGL9Q,Very disappointed! Even my credit to my CC was less that what was promised.,1459123200,,75,4.428571428571429
8410086,4,B003ZAGL9Q,My brother bought me this. I was so enjoying the ride until I got to the Gettysburg Battlefield and it started jumping and just wouldn't play so I needed to stop it..I was enjoying it up until then  :(,1445990400,,201,4.153846153846154

8410088,5,B003ZAGL9Q,"Love the bov cycling videos! This was no exception. Cycling through the countryside and quaint towns was a joy,  making workout time go faster; liked the accompanying music too.",1407715200,,177,5.103448275862069
8410089,5,B003ZAGL9Q,"I live within 30 miles of both the Pa Dutch and Gettysburg areas. I bought this DVD to use with my exercise bike and it was well worth it. The open land, the farms and many sites I am familiar with reminds me of driving these actual roads. The only thing that is missing is the FRESH smell  of the animals. The trip through Gettysburg is nice, but I was it would have been longer, I would recommend this DVD if you are interested in traveling through the Pa Dutch/Lancaster County or Gettysburg areas.",1396742400,,501,4.329787234042553
8410090,3,B003ZAGL9Q,The video is beautiful. I gave it a 3 because I really don't like the music you have on any of your videos. I know we can mute it but I love nature sounds and I have other videos that give me the option to listen to music or nature. Why don't you have these options? It would be a 5 then. Thanks,1323993600,2,295,3.6984126984126986
