174722,5,0849975034,"Thank you so much.  Bought this book 20 years ago for my first grandchild and bought this book for my second grandchild.  Only difference is perhaps the size--this one may be smaller than the other.  Max Lucado did a wonderful job with this story and my grandson sits on my lap and talks about Joshua the spotted lamb and Abigail, the cow who is Joshua's friend.  This is a story all children should have in their library.  Again, my thanks.",1423008000,,441,4.4625
174723,4,0849975034,"We have been fans of Max Lucado for many years and are glad to have this DVD.  It is a sweet story about how even the least of us can be a true blessing to others when we least expect it.  This animated short has the talents of Robbie Benson and Jodi Benson and they both are terrific.  The music is a delight!  Even though written for young children, we still enjoyed this story of encouragement and love.",1421020800,,406,4.166666666666667

174730,4,0849975034,"Brought this video for my grandchildren ages 3 & 6.  Really wanted them to see how important each one of us is to God and also why God doesn't always heal us.  This message was very good. Also the 2nd story on the video ""The alabaster Angel was every bit as good.",1293494400,7,263,4.038461538461538
174731,5,0849975034,Movies about the birth of Christ are far and few in between.  This movie as so many others brought home the message that Jesus is the Reason for this Season!  It is a must to see and own.,1229040000,,187,3.8947368421052633

7795380,5,0849975034,"This DVD is very well done and such a sweet story.  The book has a great reputation however, I decided to buy the DVD.  I bought it for my grandson who is 2 and he watched a lot longer than I expected. I think that in time as he ages he will be able to watch it entirely.  However, he did like the animation of the animals.  He didn't' follow the songs as much as I did, I enjoyed it!",1481846400,,384,3.7625

7795383,5,0849975034,"My son received this as a gift last holiday season. He fell in love with it. He was only 2. He called it the ""sheep cow"" movie. Over the course of a year it has gotten scratched. I want my children to understand the real meaning of Christmas so I'm buying another. I will keep this one much safer so it lasts longer! The story is so sweet, music is perfect for toddlers. They also loved Alabaster's Angel which is after it. The wisemen are hilarious!",1448150400,,450,4.244186046511628
