8121611,5,6305223661,"This movie is set in Brooklyn and it is about a single mother (Alma) and her teenaged daughter (Rainbow) who don't see eye to eye. Alma is very strict and protective of Rainbow and she has reason. Rainbow often skips school to dance with her two male buddies (who don't pay much attention to her because of her tom-boy ways) on the street for money. The main conflict of the story arises when Alma's free-spirited and flashy/sassy sister arrives and Rainbow instantly becomes smitten with her and wants to be just like her. However, Rainbow latter becomes dissapointed with her aunt. This movie is a good coming of age story and a good story about a Mother and Daughter finding themselves. Oh yea, the music is also really good.",1107475200,2,728,4.651162790697675
