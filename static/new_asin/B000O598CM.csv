It has a CD included which is good, what happens on that CD is a wee bit fast and looks easier than it is, so if you are expecting a patient You Tube clip you won't find it here. What you will find is a lesson from a Master guitarist who is yet humble and doesn't try to show off. If you don't believe me
look on Amazon for the CDs of Pentangle or of John Renbourn and Bert Jansch, since they were two members of that folk super group. The Lady and the Unicorn, a CD by John can be bought off Amazon: you will hear what these tunes can sound like when you have mastered them :-) Good luck and happy playing...",1360540800,,694,3.86013986013986
