The movie begins by naming each actor and the character they play. There is a meeting where a man talks against the rustlers (cattle thieves) who are found not guilty by a jury. Another man questions him, there is a fight. They ask for punishment before a trial! Spud explains his reasons. I was only joking. Spud talks to Bob Wilson, who says he was framed. Spud explains his plan to get Bob out of jail. Mr. Fleming explains his purpose. Two men shoot their pistols away from the jail to draw the Sheriff away. The gang lead Bob Wilson away. He knows a trick to get away and evade this lynch mob. Fleming wants to buy Marys ranch. Spud knows a trick too. Fleming swore out a warrant of Mary and sent her back to Salina. Lock me up! [Contrary personality?] Spud and Bob go to a line cabin. They meet a stranger, Flemings boys start a fight. Spud and Bob are ordered away.

Fleming asks for another deed, Mary Scott won't do it. So Fleming charges her with swindling, shell stay in jail. Spud and Bob inspect Flemings house. Bob talks to Fleming about the Cross Bar ranch. He offers a deal. There is another fight, Fleming loses. But his boys return and the tables are turned! Bob figures that sticky dirt is potash, a valuable mineral! Bob and Spud cut their ropes and capture Flemings boys! Where did Fleming go? Bob offers a deal to the men if they tell how Bob was framed. Will they agree? Spud visits the jail and talks to Mary. Later Bob visits that tavern seeking Fleming. There is another fight in the tavern. Fleming rides away. There is a chase to add action. Bob catches up to Fleming and captures him. Bob tells Mary the good news about her property. She will not go east but remain and settle down. A happy ending.

This is an average drama about an attempt to swindle a young woman out of her valuable property. The lesson is to know what your property is worth before accepting an offer. [Think of those Cash for Gold stores.] It warns against accepting peoples stories when they have a hidden agenda. This has more humor than some other movies. It was adapted from James Oliver Curwoods book Game of Life. A good story makes a good movie.",1404604800,,2183,4.398514851485149
