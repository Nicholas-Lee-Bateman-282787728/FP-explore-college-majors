2688653,4,B000KEG8MU,3 hours of excellent footage (a lot of which you don't see on TV) featuring defending champ Valentino Rossi's uphill battle (particularly after getting knocked off the bike in the first race!) against series leader Nicky Hayden that came down to the final two races of the season.  Lots of interviews and behind-the-scenes extras put the season into a pretty concise package.  Recommended for anyone who likes the best in Grand Prix bike racing.,1169078400,4,445,5.0
2688654,2,B000KEG8MU,"Sorry to say it but this video does a huge disservice to the great sport of MotoGP. Dorna (MotoGP right holder)as a generally savvy media company should take the production from SRO and take it inhouse. The DVD is 180 minutes long but the pre-race and race reports account for only about 120 minutes. While the picture quality is excellent, the coverage of each race is maddeningly inconsistent with in several cases the pivotal action being left out. The other 60 minutes is taken up by video tours of the participating countries (in most cases they used the exact same footage from previous year's DVDs) and the obligatory camera onboard lap which again differs little from previous years. Overall very disappointing, if I wasn't such a big bike fan I wouldn't buy it. If you want to see a really good racing bike DVD check out the World Superbike year review, its a far superior product (the DVD, not the actual racing).",1167955200,13,923,4.703703703703703

8155845,5,B000KEG8MU,"This was my first experience with MotoGP.  I thought the Isle of Man TT was insane, which it is.  Replace drain pipes and rock walls with competitors inches away, and you have MotoGP.  As one of the commentators put it, ""you could lay a hankie over two of these riders"".  Fast action.  Some of the best riding on the planet.",1365724800,,324,4.333333333333333

8155848,4,B000KEG8MU,"Following in the illustrious footsteps of Americans who have dominated since the late 70's, Nicky Hayden usurps boy wonder Italian Valentino Rossi to be crowned King in 2006.

The video could have spent a few more minutes before each race instead of fervently rushing into qualifying and the race footage. However, this is a must for any American Motorcycling racing fan. The last American champion was crowned in 2000 - Kenny Robert Jr in the 500cc 2 stroke class on a Suzuki. Nicky, the Kentucky kid does it on the new engine format of 990cc 4 stroke on a Honda. Of course since 2007, the displacement has dropped to 800cc.

I followed the exploits of Kenny Roberts Sr of Modesto, Calif. on Yamaha, whose dirt tracking style experience and skill defeated the established Europeans in the late 70's. He was followed by the boy wonder Freddie Spencer from the bayou's of Louisiana. The 80's and early 90's were dominated by Americans - Eddie the king of cool Lawson, Randy the joker Mamola, Wayne the iceman Rainey, and Kevin the flamboyant Shwantz.

Formula 1 and Nascar are bigger than motorcycle racing, but even with traction control today, motorcycling is by far the most exciting form of racing to watch. Today though not a dominant force, there are a few young Americans in the mix incluing John Hopkins on Kawasaki, two time WSB champion Colin the Texas Tornado Edwards and of course the Kentucky Kid, Nicky Hayden.",1198540800,,1423,4.8
8155849,4,B000KEG8MU,"I think the video quality was good, so I don't know what the folks with VHS like versions were watching.

As to the racing, I appreciate that it's hard to get a whole season on one DVD, but there was no continuity in any of the races.

That said, I enjoyed this and don't regret buying it. Worth the money, but not as good as a Duke TT review, which are now twin DVDs.",1187568000,,368,3.9594594594594597
8155850,5,B000KEG8MU,Sent the DVD to my boyfriend in IRAQ!  He loved it said it was awesome and it makes him miss home even more!!!  He recommends it to anyone who loves street bikes!,1176249600,,162,4.03125
8155851,1,B000KEG8MU,"what is up with the quality of image on this dvd, it looks like a cheap VHS image,  whats the point of DVD???  Moto gp needs to take a page from NFL films  and properly document their history, after all it's only 16 races or so.  I could understand in the case of hockey or baseball with 1000+ games to cover.  the worlds most exciting sport deserves better!",1173571200,2,358,4.205882352941177

8155853,5,B000KEG8MU,"Hi MotoGP fans. I am the Director of Sales for Standing Room Only, which released this DVD.

First. thank you for your interest in the 2006 Review. It was one of the most exciting years in some time.

Please allow me to address a misapprehension on the part of one Amazon reviewer; that this title might have been better if developed and produced by Dorna, the rights holder. In fact, it was produced in its entirety by Dorna; Standing Room Only distributes the finished product without any modification, straight from the source.

Customer comments are always important to us, and we communicate them promptly to the actual producer. Needless to say, we want to put out the best product possible. In this case we have no authority to alter the program in any way, should it be appropriate.

That said, I think you will all find this to be highly exciting and enthralling viewing, with a close contest between Rossi and Hayden, and a large number of extra scenes and interviews. Thanks again!",1169078400,6,992,4.716763005780347
