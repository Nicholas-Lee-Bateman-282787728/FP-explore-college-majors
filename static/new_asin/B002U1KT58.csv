All the scenes that people say were missing are in this version. I'm glad I got this when I did because it seems that the only one available on Amazon now is the one that everyone is very unhappy with. Not to mention that I'm a Jackie movie fanatic and have seen many actresses trying to portray her. In my opinion, this actress is one of the very few that seemed to at least nail jackie's voice and her breathiness. They did pretty good in the hair department too. I wasn't as accepting of Tim Matheson as JFK though. But still, this in my top 3 of my Jackie movie collection.",1459468800,,701,4.124087591240876
8380921,2,B002U1KT58,"TV Movie DRAMA bio of Jackie Kennedy~ badly done~

made in 2000 this miniseries~ with Joanne Whalley (Scarlett) as Jackie Kennedy~ bad wigs do not aid her image of the lovely Jackie Kennedy~ ADD Tim Matheson who has the voice down right but is a bit too ""mature"" as Jack Kennedy~ so here we have two badly cast actors~ add a LOUSY script and we have the movie~
Starts as Jack is clear he feels marriage is not for him but is bullied by his father (Tom Skerritt)Joseph Kennedy~ into marriage with the lovely Jackie Bouvier~ shows while Jackie GRIEVING in the  hospital suffering the birth of a still born daughter Jack is busy ""womanizing"" in Italy~ Jackie leaves him but soon she moves back and we see the movie pick up with ""cuts"" of actual 1960's black and white footage~ this adds too the over all ""feel"" of the movie but nothing can save this. Whalley~ is fair as Jackie but spends too much time crying~ and we move on too the death of JFK and on to her relationship Onasis~ there is no historic accuracy and no charm~ worth the watch once~ very bored children acting as Jon Jon and Caroline Kennedy.

the ONLY thing that saves this movie is the actual ""cut"" in film of actual 1960's film which saves this from being a total BORE~ I give it two stars and that is being Generous~",1269475200,3,1282,4.355648535564853
