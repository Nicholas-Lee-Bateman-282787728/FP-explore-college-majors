I loved the live music and the way the stars interacted with the audience! I would definately recommend this to anyone! I bought both the DVD and the live CD...I can't wait to get it!",1178236800,4,293,4.444444444444445
2797312,4,B000OLGCFM,"Well i'm lucky i saw this DVD before anyone. I have some friends who work for the Disney Channel, and one of myy friends edits the DVD's so i saw this DVD. The High School Musical movie was great but the singing in the Live Concert is much better and sounds really real not fake like in the movie. This DVD is a must Have!!!",1174953600,19,324,4.0

2797317,3,B000OLGCFM,I was disappointed that Zac Efron wasn't singing with Vanessa Hudgins. Otherwise it was great. I loved watching the movie. I wish there was a sequel to this movie called the the college years.,1404172800,,192,4.676470588235294

2797320,4,B000OLGCFM,"Like the three movies,this is good family entertainment. It's a one-hour concert of songs from the original,nicely staged and well-performed by a spirited young cast. The dance numbers are sensational,and the behind-the-
scenes stuff is fun. Very entertaining.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-The-Concert/dp/B000TI85WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical: The Concert</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-Encore-Edition/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical (Encore Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-2-Extended-Edition/dp/B000VAPZM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical 2 (Extended Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-3-Senior-Year/dp/B001NE80P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical 3: Senior Year</a>",1237939200,2,1002,13.75
2797321,5,B000OLGCFM,"This is footage of a touring concert staring many of the cast from the film.  The lead male ""Zac"" is absent however and this was the first thing my little ones noticed.  The singing still entertains and the performance does include some new songs that the artists are promoting from their new solo albums.  If you have the film you could do without this version as it is a repetition of the same tunes.  If you are a fan you will enjoy seeing the stars sing the old favourites all over again.",1228089600,,492,4.315217391304348
2797322,5,B000OLGCFM,"No matter you have been to the concert or not, this is a must-buy for any high school musical fans. I am a fan of Ashley Tisdale, and I wish this DVD could have included all 3 Ashley Tisdale-solo songs, since this DVD has only one: ""We'll Be Together."" The plus side (in my opinion) is, if you like Jordan Pruitt, this DVD includes 4 songs from the opening act by her. I wish I could have seen the concert! I love this DVD, and I give it a 5-star.",1201132800,2,447,3.977777777777778

2797325,4,B000OLGCFM,"I bought the dvd. It doesn't have all the songs from the concert. Jordan Pruitt's opening was missing ""We Are Family"". They interviewed 6 stars when they were leving one star in the shadow's. She is Jordan. Someone should go to the makers and tell them that this dvd and the soundtrack should have everything from the concert. Also, Jordan is now part of the HSM family.",1185235200,,370,4.537313432835821
2797326,3,B000OLGCFM,"I bought this DVD for my daughter who is a die-hard fan of the TV movie and anything associated with it.  Actually, the whole family loved the movie.

In addition to the songs from the movie, the DVD also includes songs by Ashley Tisdale, Carbin Bleu, and Vanessa Hudgens.  What's disappointing with this DVD is that the concert is about 90% lip-synched.  As far as I can tell, Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel lip-synched all of their songs.  I think the only one who got to sing live were Drew Seeley and (I think) Vanessa Hudgens.

But I guess it's kinda understandable that singing is not live since they are not really concert performers and doing a tour such as this one can take toll on one's voice; thus, they resort to lip-synching.  Well, it's not as if they're the only ones who do it.  I've seen concert videos of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and Madonna where they also do this.  I guess it's already a norm for concerts nowadays.  However, it somehow takes away the enjoyment of really hearing live singing from concert performers. It's like they're cheating the people who paid to see and hear them live.

But, nonetheless, this DVD is a good view while we wait for the showing of High School Musical 2 later this year.  For this new movie, I wonder if it's still Drew Seeley who sings for Zak Efron.",1184889600,13,1346,4.539419087136929

2797330,4,B000OLGCFM,"I went to the concert and I could not wait until this DVD came out so my whole family could see it.  I especially wanted them to see Lucas.  When I got it, a lot of Lucas' parts were cut out, so it was disappointing.  I wish the DVD was the whole concert.  At least they could have told everyone that parts would be cut out instead of advertising it as ""The Concert.""  They could have instead called it ""High School Musical-Part of the Concert.""",1182816000,4,445,4.188235294117647
