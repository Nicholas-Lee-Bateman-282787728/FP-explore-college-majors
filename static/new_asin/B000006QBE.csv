A Time travel tru history, you'll go to Port Royale back then and now (underwater). Theres also Brief biographis of  the Most famous Pirates, including Blackbeard, Morgan and Drake among  others.  If you love history and want to know more about this Chapter  of Piracy Ill also recomend Pirates!, also from A&E.  You won't be  dissapointed with any of these videos, and they  run longer than the  A&E TV version.",964483200,7,518,4.666666666666667
