8111005,5,B0002YG2WE,The game was fun when you play it in party mode instead of full game format. Gave it 5 stars because it is inexpensive and you can get a few fun games out of it with your friends before it's time to re-gift to someone else!,1292371200,,223,3.869565217391304
8111006,1,B0002YG2WE,"Really disappointed by this game.  If you play once, you better just throw it away, because there are so many repeat questions (even in the first game we played, there were at least 3 or 4 repeat questions).  Some of the questions were very poorly worded and just bad trivia questions overall.  For example, there's a clip of Preist Holmes and it asks, ""What is Preist Holmes about to do?  A. Hurdle a player  B. Knock a player down  C. Dodge a player""  (Not exact wording but the best I can remember).  I could have written better trivia questions.

If you're looking for a good Football trivia game, get the Ultimate Football Trivia Game by Outset Media.  It's a board game, but much much better than this joke of a DVD trivia game.",1107734400,2,734,4.451127819548872

This DVD game has hundreds of interactive questions about all the classic college football games and players and has one of a kind footage from Red Grange to Ricky Williams!

This is a game you can't pass up.  Check it out by searching for ""NCAA Football DVD Trivia Challenge"" or going to ncaatrivia dot com!",1106870400,2,415,4.736111111111111
