1657887,4,B00005RYLC,"Written by Brian Clemens (Emma Peel/Tara King TV Avengers) and directed by Bob Fuest (Wuthering Heights, the Vincent Price 'Dr. Phibes' movies), this suspense escapade was filmed in the summer of 1969 in rural France, with its windy roads and small towns. Two young British women arrive for a week of sun and fun which turns dark (in broad daylight) with talk of the murder which once took place within the small community, a mysterious guy on a motorbike who follows them around from the outset, and cast of other characters (British expat school teacher, stereotyped Gallic cafe owners, and a squad of gendarmes).

The story takes some time to ramp up, and there's a moment towards the end where our heroine just happens to enter an isolated part of the landscape, where she rather serendipitously makes a frightening discovery, but if you can tolerate such dramatic foibles, this story is a good romp from beginning to end.

Anchor Bay's 2002 DVD was an excellent package. The transfer was magnificent: great color saturation and detail, free of visual artifacts that might have been expected after 30 years. Feature commentary by Clemens and Fuest was rich in detail and covered all sorts of professional gossip regarding the British studio system at the time. Clemens loves to talk and makes confident, incisive observations regarding the cast and the story creation, with Fuest adding some observations about filming in summery, sunny France.

As I write this, this DVD appears to be out of print. Brian Clemens died very recently, and this suspense yarn deserves to be reissued, if only to carry on his memory.",1434844800,,1617,4.959409594095941

horror  [hawr-er, hor-]  noun
1.an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying, or revolting; a shuddering fear

FYI - Bambi was more horrific than the Brits were in this painfully slow murder mystery.  However, I gave it two stars because I didn't just quit it halfway in as I normally would, I played my get out of jail free card and FF to the end to solve the mystery.

This is the first horror movie I've seen that builds a synergistic disturbing sense of dread throughout in bright sunlight; only the truth, the climax, the denouncement, will bring darkness--to which the lead actress, persistent, smart, and nosey--almost succumbs.

1657910,5,B00005RYLC,"I asked the question the other night ""why can't they make a film that doesn't rely on nudity or torture scenes?"".  The next night a friend brought over this movie and it was refreshing to see a well made movie that had a plot, odd characters, suspense, nice camera work and direction.  The acting wasn't Oscar material but it wasn't nearly as bad as I have seen in other movies.  And there is no nudity, excessive gore, torture, benging on drugs/alcohol or excessive profanity.  Instead the movie relies on a solid plot, nice camera work and direction.  It is more of a suspense than a horror.

Two British nurses are biking through the French countryside.  They stop for a rest, have an argument then end up splitting up.  One goes ahead to the next town.  The other stays to lay out in the sun and rest.  After a few hours of waiting for her friend to show up she starts questioning a few of the odd locals and soon discovers the road she is traveling on is a ""Bad Road""...things get interesting from there.  The entire movie takes place in daylight hours.  The small towns along the country road are desolate the town folk look poor and tired. What makes the town people ""odd"" in my opinion is that they rarely talk.  They mainly observe what goes on around them and try to stay indoors (the doors are locked alot in the movie).  They are not openly friendly nor do they volunteer any information.  Later in the movie the viewer finds out why they don't volunteer any information and it comes together rather nicely.",1327104000,7,1519,4.492700729927007
1657911,5,B00005RYLC,"Robert Fuest (Avengers, The Abominable Dr. Phibes) directs a slow-burning masterwork of mood and dread. What struck me in the first few moments, before the story got its hooks into me, was how unadorned the direction of this film is. Surprising, given Mr. Fuest's resume. But not surprising, given the simple set up and spare elements of this story - just two young women cycling through the French countryside on holiday, about to take a figurative detour into trouble. That's all I'll say about the story. This is a film that you should enter into knowing as little as possible, as I did, and allow it to tighten its cords about you unawares as you sit transfixed through scene after scene. For this is a story that unfolds like one of those disorienting real-life episodes that we've all been through at some point - like getting lost somewhere, then working your way through the confusion as you problem-solve your situation. This movie is JUST like that, causing us to identify closely with the lead character and worry for her all the way.

Without giving anything away, the film's power lies in how it masterfully keeps us guessing - guessing about what has happened, who we can trust, and how it holds its secret to the very end, yielding nothing - a feat deserving of study by today's filmmakers, who fill the world with so much ""predictablilia"". There is nothing predictable about this story because it feels so plotless, so absent of formula, so uncliched. Just a natural unfolding of events, like real experience, and yet dreamlike. This is why it remains remarkable to this day.

The movie stars Pamela Franklin (The Legend of Hellhouse), who is perfectly cast as the more responsible of the two girls, her more frivolous companion played by Michele Dotrice (Hammer Film's The Witches).

This film may be counted among the great paranoid thrillers - it ranks with Polanski's best. And if it has a close cousin, I'd offer that it shares some similarity (though not in a duplicative way) with Richard Matheson's Dying Room Only, starring Cloris Leachman - a little bonus recommendation  - add it to your cart with this one before checking out from Amazon. ;)",1312761600,10,2169,4.806970509383378

1657913,4,B00005RYLC,"***some spoilers herein***

As a fan of classic horror (including that of the 70s part of the genre) as well as a fan of Pamela Franklin, I had been wanting to see this film for several years and finally got a DVD copy. Robert Fuest, who directed another favorite of mine, ""Wuthering Heights"" (1970), did a masterful job at conveying the quiet menace and isolated feeling of dread. Two young British nurses, Jane (Franklin), and Cathy (Michele Dotrice, daughter of Roy, sister of Karen), are on a bicycling holiday in rural France, where, unbeknownst to them, a murder of young woman tourist took place a few years before. The assailant was never caught. They are blissfully ignorant of this fact, and a mysterious young man, Paul (Hungarian actor Sandor Eles) catches Cathy's eye when the girls make a stop at a small cafe. Of course, it becomes apparent to the viewers that Paul knows more about the murder than he lets on. He shadows the girls for a while, even visits the cemetery where the unfortunate victim is buried. As to whether or not this is a deliberate red herring or not is revealed as the story progresses.

Jane and Cathy make another stop on the side of the road several miles down from the cafe and rest for a while on the edge of some pretty thick woods. They get into an argument and Jane leaves in a huff, while Cathy finds herself vulnerable possibly to the perpetrator of the aforementioned crime, in a frightening scene that lets one imagine the terror. After a little time has passed, Jane begins to grow concerned for her friend and regrets leaving Cathy alone. However, she is nowhere to be found. The locals seem to know something but as they don't seem to speak English and Jane knows very little French, her confusion and apprehension becomes that of the audience as well. The local British schoolteacher (Clare Kelly) believes that the killer was also a tourist. Paul claims to have worked on the case and offers to help Jane, but her suspicions and his sketchy behavior cause our young heroine to flee from him and try to get assistance elsewhere. The title of the movie is actually very appropriate, despite the fact that the story takes place in broad daylight. The fact that the later the day grows, the darker it will eventually get, signalling doom and possible death. There is also no violence or blood until the climax. Who is the murderer? Paul? One of the townspeople? The local police officer (John Nettleton)? Or has Cathy simply decided to play a joke on her friend? This movie will keep you guessing. Very nice cinematography as well, and the music is quite good, with the exception of the opening and ending credit tune, a bit bizarre considering the tone of the film.

Pamela Franklin never really got the credit she deserved as an actress: she was so convincing in everything I saw her in. Here she is believable as a young nurse caught in a terrifying trap in an unfamiliar country. Dressed simply but nicely throughout, she has a doe-like quality here which makes her seem all the more vulnerable. Michele Dotrice is lovely as well (wish she could have been seen more in films). The late Sandor Eles was unknown to me at the time, but quite good. While not overly menacing or devastatingly handsome, he did possess an interesting charisma. All of the actors cast helped add to the aura of atmospheric suspense.

""And Soon The Darkness"" was recently remade, and no doubt, the Hollywood version will most likely make everything more graphic and obvious. It seems they are running out of ideas. I probably don't have to tell you that I don't think much of remakes in general.

The DVD: The film's theatrical trailer, radio spots and talent bios are included, as well as commentary by director Fuest, screenwriter Brian Clemens and Christopher Lee biographer Jonathan Sothcott. I rate the commentary as okay but I don't know why they bemoan the fact that they did not cast a different actor to play Paul. Did they have someone else in mind? I would like to have heard more about Pamela Franklin as well. Some commentaries I like to listen to more than once; this isn't one of them. It could have been better, but it's not the worst commentary I've ever heard.

In conclusion, this is one suspense film you can watch during the day and still get a good scare. Recommended.",1299283200,,4318,4.66010498687664
1657914,5,B00005RYLC,"While this British Horror entry certainly takes its time in establishing its characters and crafting its tension, the patient viewer will be paid off with a beautifully shot and entirely suspenseful thriller! Two English girls are making a biking tour of France when they decide to separate for a few hours. When one returns to find the other, she finds their resting place deserted. She is then approached by a charming Frenchman who stops to see if he can help, but she soon discovers that he knows more than he is letting on to. What follows is a brilliant murder mystery where everyone in a small village is found suspect. It is all the more alarming that none of the French characters are subtitled, since it is impossible to tell if they are friend or foe. The story structure keeps the audience guessing at every turn, throwing a new curve just when the viewer thinks they have found the killer. On top of the keen visuals, a sinister score heightens the suspense, striking an ominous chord even in the more mild scenes. Themes of rape and murder are handled with the utmost subtlety, since the acts are only alluded two while showing nothing on screen. This allowed the film to achieve all of the gut-wrenching terror above will earning itself a PG rating! The film is sure to have influenced Dutch director George Sluizer in many ways, as DARKNESS also shares a great deal of similarities in character and tone to SPOORLOOS. Though this one is difficult to get your hands on, it is well worth seeking out and comes highly recommended!

1657915,3,B00005RYLC,"Most slasher movies ,and other movies revolving around a psychopath stalking actual and potential victims ,take place in darkness .The stalkings and slashings either happen mainly at night or else in confined ,dark spaces -derelict buildings ,deep dark and dank woods etc

This 1970 UK thriller- a prototype for the slasher movies of later in that decade- does at least try to break that pattern .It revolves around two young English nurses (Michelle Dotrice and Pamela Franklin)on a cycling holiday in rural France and being stalked by a knife wielding maniac .The locale is rural ,outdoorsy and well lit ,in contrast to the usual settuings for this kind of cinematic mayhem .
The problem is that the revelation of the killer's identity is too protarcted and the movie feels more like a fleshed out TV drama than anything fully cinematic .Indeed its writer Brian Clemens is betetr known in the UK for his TV work

Robert Fuest does a fair job of building suspense and makes nice use of the rural French vistas but there are not really enough suspects to go round and the acting is adequate but no more.
I admire its ambition in seeking to break the standard mould for this sort of thing if only in locale and ambience but it is no more than fair in its actual execution",1194134400,,1270,4.665178571428571

The story is very simple. Two girls are on a cycling holiday in France and one of them disappears. Watching this as a youngster I was very scared and having bought a region 1 copy it holds up well all these years later. The director Robert Feust keeps the tension admirably high without having that 'in your face' quality of some modern thrillers. There is a lot of subtlety in this film that is sadly missing from some modern teen slasher films. Clearly the director was from the Alfred Hitchcock school of what you can't see is scary, rather than showing everything upfront.

1657919,5,B00005RYLC,"""And Soon the Darkness"" is one of those odd little films that occasionally surfaces in some of the better reference books on horror and suspense, but remains unknown to the casual fan.
This is unfortunate, because ""Darkness"" is something almost unique in the suspense genre: a film taking place almost completely in daylight, yet conveying a sense of encroaching doom that rivals some of the best films in the field.
The film is almost plotless. Two nurses go on a biking excursion through the French countryside to see ""the real France."" But they have a falling out, and after their rift one of them (played by Michelle Dotrice) is murdered by an unseen (off-screen) assailant. The other girl, Pamela Franklin, struggles on, but soon a lone detective, claiming to be from the police, joins her, and they ""collaborate"" in a search for the missing girl.
It isn't long before ""Jane"" (Pamela) grows suspicious of the detective, and starts to believe he's the killer. Once this suspicion dawns, we witness her sporadic attempts to get to the bottom of things. Her meetings with the local gendarme, a caf owner, a schoolteacher, and a blind war veteran, uncover nothing ---- though their collective ""testimony"" only adds to her unease. Eventually, of course, we discover the real killer, who, though constantly prowling the daylight, almost succeeds in delivering ""darkness"" to his second victim in a row.
To repeat ---- the remarkable thing about the film is how the constant scanning of open, sun-drenched fields and barren roads evokes an atmosphere of dread. I'm hard-pressed to name another film which accomplishes its aims by similar means ---- almost all the clichs of cobwebs, shadowy stairways, and rain-soaked streets are missing here. Only toward the end, when Franklin tries to hide from the detective in a ramshackle hut, do we get a recourse to the more conventional methods of ""noir"" ---- yet, precisely because it comes so late in the day (both literally and figuratively), it's that much more unnerving.
Pamela Franklin shows once again that she is one of the most underrated actresses of her day. Completely unglamourized, dressed simply in a white shirt and tan shorts, she shows little of the beautiful gamin she played in ""Sinful Davey"" (1968) or the lusciously sexy flapper of ""Ace Eli and Roger of the Skies"" (1973). This allows her more scope for nuances of expression, while simultaneously bringing her more firmly into the ""girl next door"" camp.
As a side note, it's interesting to compare the music score to that of the much-later ""Silence of the Lambs."" Though worlds apart in other respects, the leitmotif of descending notes that runs through ""Darkness"" clearly anticipates passages in ""Lambs."" Only the tawdry jazz accompanying the opening and closing credits mars what is otherwise an effectively eerie score.
Anchor Bay's DVD edition serves the film equivocally. While nothing spectacular video-wise, it's a vast improvement over VHS versions, and its audio track is better still, conveying nice clarity in both dialogue and music. The full-length commentary, however, is disappointing. Not only do Robert Fuest (director) and Brian Clemens (screenwriter) say almost nothing about Franklin (calling her at one point ""unknowable""), they spend as much time discussing their parts in the ""Avengers"" TV series as they do the film itself. Worse, their comments are rarely screen-specific --- Fuest and Clemens take the roles of  ""essayists,"" talking abstractedly about their past careers and some of the more marginal aspects of film production. A scene-by-scene discussion would have been more effective.
Whatever its flaws, this disc is a fine addition to the suspense genre, and I would highly recommend it to those who want to see what a thriller can accomplish with a minimum of means. It embodies what to my mind is almost a new subgenre, which might tentatively be called ""Film Blanc.""",1075420800,47,3915,5.107644305772231

No French subtitiles provided so you're in the dark for most of the movie unless you actually speak French. I enjoy 70's flicks when they are done right but this was just a silly waste of time. :(,1503273600,,353,4.363636363636363

7952735,4,B00005RYLC,"I looked at the remake, and decided that this was superior, though the remake was pretty good. This reminded me a little of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now, in its sense of alienation and dread. The original Dutch version of The Vanishing deserves comparison, too. An overlooked classic. It also reminds me of the talent of Doctor Who writer Terry Nation, who gave us the Daleks and other science fiction series. He knew how to create suspense.",1455580800,,443,4.766233766233766

7952737,2,B00005RYLC,This movie was pretty much a waste of time.  Poor acting and a weak story line about two gals who got separated while touring on bikes.  It was not  believable.  It had poor character development.  I gave it two stars for effort.,1453593600,,229,4.357142857142857
