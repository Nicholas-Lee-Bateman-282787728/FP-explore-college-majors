8441142,4,B004U1DHN2,"Amazing Rene Fleming... But there are complete recordings with her which are better. The best part of the show is the last one : Cappricio. Marvelous singing and she wears a magnificent dress by Galiano. If you wish to enjoy a magnificent Manon, you have to buy the Opera de Paris DVD with Fleming and Marcelo Alvarez, Ludovic Tzier. Better than this one. A must ! The Traviata in London with Calleja is a very good show, too. I love the Cappriccio DVD with Fleming, Finley, Trost and Von Otter (stage : Carsen).",1406764800,,512,4.516129032258065

8441144,3,B004U1DHN2,"I liked the performances, however ,the real drawback are the views of audiences in times square. This seriously cuts in the enjoyment of the opera, as we are forced to see bored people who don't care to be there. It adds absolutely nothing to the opera, which is what we want to see!!!

8441145,5,B004U1DHN2,"I'm a big fan or Renee, so for me she can do no wrong. She's on best form and she manages superbly in this real vocal marathon, the voice at its most beautiful and expressive. Who else could show such versatility in just one evening? She has mostly superb support from Vargas, Hampson and Levine. Her detractors might find her not very natural and slightly overdressed, but to me she's the most expressive singer on earth, with a voice with all the colors of a rainbow in it...
Highly recommended to all lovers of vocal splendour, not just to the diva's fans!",1362355200,2,559,4.490196078431373
