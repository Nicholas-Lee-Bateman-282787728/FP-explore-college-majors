8680108,4,B00NTACSY4,"If you have an interest in early silent movie studios and production, this is a film for you. The scenario involves a country girl who wants to make it big in the flickers.  The usual heartbreak and ending. What is of interest, at least to me, about the film is the inside view of a working film company. It takes you into a studio and on the sets. Props are moved. cameras lined up and cranking. The director is Maurice Tourneur who also plays the role of director in the scenario. His son Jacques Tourneur was a good directer also  (Cat People, etc.). Not filmed in Hollywood but in New Jersey when East Coast film studios still were active.  I recommend the film.",1501372800,,666,4.3983739837398375
