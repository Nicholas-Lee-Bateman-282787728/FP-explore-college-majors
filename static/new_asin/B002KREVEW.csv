8372191,1,B002KREVEW,"Even Tarentino's intentional inside jokes in the movie Grindhouse weren't as visually or audibly abrasive as this HORRIBLE DVD from one of the worst prints I've ever seen. Even Something Weird Video would be too embarrassed to release this film in such horrible condition. Somewhere in the world there HAS to be a print, or inter negative in better condition than this.

8372193,4,B002KREVEW,"I'll start by confirming that the image quality of this Code Red DVD release is quite watchable, in spite of the heavily evident through-out print damage. This is an extremely rare 1970's Grindhouse curio I've wanted to see since reading Bill Landis's recommendation in his and Michelle Clifford's authoritative book: Sleazoid Express. (available from Amazon)

 Candice Rialson makes her screen debut as a sultry teenage runaway, looking for fun fuelled frolics in what develops into a (Some Bizzare-like) tale of psycho-sexual fascination, from the nocturnal city streets to a small town of kooky characters all seeking to taste Candy's youthful verve.

  I really like this movie, everyone involved delivers committed spirited performances especially gorgeous Candice, showing genuine screen presence in this one of a kind picture. Ed (UFO) Bishop is a revelation as a collector of beautiful things whose home contains covert desires for control via possession. Ed just about manages to maintain his straight deadpan delivery as to elicit the requisite comedic tone befitting such a demented dnouement.

 Pets' has that tangible 1970's American vibe running through it evoking within me nostalgia for a place, at that time, I never knew. Inversely as a child of 1970's England with a burgeoning American influence upon my British movie and music tastes would indelibly graft and fuse a lasting and longing mark upon me. It is said that- ""if you can remember the 1970's you weren't there"", which may be true, except I was a young child captivated and entranced upon the cusp of self realisation during the second half of a decade which would transform into the
all out technicolo(u)r explosion that was 1980.

 If you can relate/empathise, to/with my previous paragraph then you'll probably enjoy Pets as much as I do, not just as a sexy movie, but as a window back into a time period which seems so long ago, but more fresh and vibrant and daring than so much of what is offered up in this epoch of more, but not always better.

 If your only contemplating this release you had better make your mind up pronto as according to Code Red DVD this is a 1500 only run of this movie which features original trailer and deleted scene, and I'd put money on it being uncut.

 I'd love to sample a Code Red DVD distillation of: Moonshine County Express featuring Candice and another queen of 70's grindhouse Claudia Jennings. Rest in Peace Claudia and Candy.",1263686400,8,2450,4.960880195599022

8372195,1,B002KREVEW,"I have on VHS an old German version of this movie under the title "" Animal woman"". Neither that VHS nor my VHS player are in good performence anymore. So I expected so much, that this movie that I really love comes out on DVD . What I got was disappointing.
First picture quality is poor but much better than old VHS.
Second : it says deleted scene. Well one scene was apparently damaged on the master so it was cut off and attached . Fine so far.
All those erotic available on my VHS , esp. the nudity is thorougly cut off. Only a few scenes topless are left. I believe anything that makes this movie R Rated is missing.
For this price I personnaly expected a uncut movie with all this nudity that made this film a cult movie.",1256688000,45,727,4.163120567375887
