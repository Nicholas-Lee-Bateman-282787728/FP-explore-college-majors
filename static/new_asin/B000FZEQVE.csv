2593219,2,B000FZEQVE,"I am looking to take a trip to see Niagara Falls.  This documentary certainly talks about the falls but I have seen other documentaries on cable that got into things to see and do in the area and this has little of that.  Instead we have songs from local artists and history of the falls past.  I couldn't have cared less about the songs and the history is a bit overdone.  It's not terrible, but it's definitely not worth the price I paid.",1339027200,4,440,4.265060240963855
2593220,3,B000FZEQVE,"This was a good experience for general informtion regarding Niagara Falls however a little too much local color - all the songs,one would really have been enough,free publicity aside these people have little to no talent and certainly do nothing to promote tourism. The competing HC is far more informative,is an easier view, no hype just the natural drama of the area itself so much more inviting PBS effort is good but HC is 5 star also PBS broadcasted different shows of Niagara and this DVD is not the better of the two the other was closer to History Channels version given the choice I would never have bothered with this PBS version and intend to resell it or donate it to local library it soesn't deserve space in a private collection",1331596800,6,742,4.628787878787879

2593223,5,B000FZEQVE,"PBS presents a fascinating look at Niagara Falls in this hour long program and doesn't leave much to the imagination in its amount of detail.  Beginning with an early history lesson, the Native Americans were the first to inhabit the land around the falls and they eventually guided European explorers to this region.  The entire area is actually comprised of three sets of waterfalls fed from four of the five great lakes with the American and Bridal Veil Falls on the United States side and Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.

In the successive years to come, Niagara Falls became a place for individuals to test their courage or maybe reveal their lunacy.  Quite a few performed audacious high wire acts while several others launched themselves over the cascades in a variety of barrels.

As the world's first source of hydroelectric power, Niagara Falls became famous in this capacity along with their generating stations being the first ever in history to send electricity over long distances.  In order to exploit the fall's maximum output, they have been reshaped, carved, manipulated and enhanced and the water flow can even be increased or decreased at will, if needed, by engineers.  What is seen today at this natural wonder, therefore, is much different than how they appeared generations ago.

Nowadays, Niagara Falls is a renowned location for weddings and honeymoons and it is regarded by many as a romantic getaway unlike any other.  Activities explored here include the `Maid of the Mist' boat excursions, `Voyage behind the Falls' adventures, and even a compact look at the gaudy tourist attractions that border the waterfalls.

For whatever reasons people choose to visit Niagara Falls, there is no mistaking their incredible beauty, awesome power, and enduring mystique.  This engaging and interesting documentary serves as a fine tribute to a magnificent landmark with its stunning photography, in-depth history, and pleasing musical accompaniment.",1188345600,34,1972,5.228571428571429

8127682,2,B000FZEQVE,"Niagara Falls (Diane Garey and Lawrence R. Hott, 2006)

Niagara Falls has a copyright date of 2006, and was produced jointly by PBS and the Niagara Tourism Commission (on both sides of the divide). The only reason I have to doubt the first part of that is that according to IMDB, the film was nominated in the Best Documentary category at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1985. That would make a little more sense given the criticisms to follow, but it still seems too recent; for a PBS production, this feels like early seventies, maybe 1975 at the latest, when they were still trying to figure out how to do that whole documentary thing. Garey and Hott produced something that feels for all the world like a no-budget tourism video, highlighting the stock quirky characters in interviews (along with, thankfully, a few folks with better heads on their shoulders), inked cardboard cutouts over scenery shots, etc.

One of the true treasures of Netflix's DVD program, and one of the greatest shortcomings of the streaming catalog since its inception, is the inclusion of weird little things like this in the former and the complete lack of same in the latter (you'll never see something like World Cup in Africa: Who Really Wins? streaming unless something fundamental changes; it is in the DVD catalog, on the other hand, and has been for years). As far as I'm concerned, the more ridiculous, the better. There are those who will think this is absolutely wonderful (my mother in law is one of them, almost certainly), and I am concerned that if Netflix abandons the DVD service, these things will lose the only real outlet they have for getting to the public. If this is up your alley, and you're a subscriber to Netflix's DVD mailing program, give it a go. Otherwise, you can give it a miss. **",1402358400,,1806,4.73015873015873
