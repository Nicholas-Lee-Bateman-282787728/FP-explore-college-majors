That in it's self was well worth the price of the disc.  If you have a love for classical music and religious art you'll love  this and watch it many times over.  For years I have been putting in religious art and came up with nothing.  I came to find out there is an entire series of this type of  dvd's.  They are by NAXOS, however they aren't  all winners !!",1385596800,6,487,4.129032258064516
