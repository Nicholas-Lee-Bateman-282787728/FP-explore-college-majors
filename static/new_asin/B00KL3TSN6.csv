The good part of this DVD is that there are a lot of shots just showing LeWitt's work, most of it as installed in museums and galleries. There are also sound bites of him talking.  The bad part is that no where in the video do we actually get to see LeWitt talking on camera!  There are only a few still photos of him.  We learn a bit about the man and what type of person he was, but I did not get any new insights into his work or his inspirations for making it.  I love LeWitts work and therefore enjoyed looking at some of it, but this DVD just did not present it in a compelling way.  In fact, if I was not already familiar with the work I would not really be interested in this.  The quality of the footage was pretty poor in spots also as it was probably originally shot on video tape.  I also am a high school teacher and would never show this to a class because they would not pay attention to it!",1518134400,,972,4.03125

8659625,5,B00KL3TSN6,"If you are intrigued by Sol LeWitt's artwork and life, consider watching this film.  I wanted to know more about his work and thought processes that inspired him and learned that music was integral.  He kept an enormous collection in his studio.  Next, I ordered books to fill in the blanks.",1478304000,,291,4.666666666666667
8659626,3,B00KL3TSN6,"I never really liked Sol's work, but figured I would put pre conceived and pre formulated notions aside and give this a chance. Perhaps I had been missing something. Admittedly, never big on conceptual or minimalist art (case by case basis), I dove in. I remain unconvinced and I include most of his peers. The advent of the dull. Art made by and for the fearful (although pretending to be brave). Best moments? Learning that Sol was generous (to students,friends, composers) and made affordable works too. However, in the grand scheme. ..dull, dull, dull.",1466380800,,556,4.925531914893617

and his philosophy.",1456876800,,74,5.818181818181818
