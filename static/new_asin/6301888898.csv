373853,5,6301888898,This is one of the greatest films ever made. Andrew Dice Clay is the greatest comedic performer of our generation. The movie is non-stop action and laughs. An all-star cast. Just a fantastic film.,922752000,,196,4.794117647058823
373944,3,6301888898,"This is a movie that if you sit down to watch is actually pretty good.  It's just as good as Lethal Weapon and other movies like that.  But probably because of Andrew Dice Clay a lot of people didn't bother with this.  It has a little bit of everything action, mystery, suspense, comedy and some romance.  And a pet Kaola.  The supporting actors Ed O'Neill. Wayne Newton, Gilbert Godfrey, Priscilla Presley and Laurne Hutton do some of their best work.  I would recommend this.",1473120000,,477,4.619047619047619

373953,3,6301888898,"Something about Andrew Dice Clay starring in movies gets on my nerves.  It's like I love his perverted comedy routine when he does stand-up, but it doesn't work so well when he tries to tame it down and incorporate it into his films.  And that's what happens throughout the Adventures of Ford Fairlane.  It's about Andrew Dice Clay trying to track and hunt down a murderer but his strong sexual attraction for women often rears its ugly head and reflects in the writing and tone of the film overall.  It works fantastically when Andrew's doing stand-up, but in a movie role it feels like he's making a mockery of the murder/mystery genre.  Andrew's character is often significantly more tame than the person we know from comedy clubs.

With that said, the Adventures of Ford Fairlane is still an okay movie.  The way some characters die such as Gilbert Gottfried as a radio personality is comical in a really bizarre kind of way (Andrew Dice leaves a music studio, comes back when he suspects danger, and returns to see Gilbert electrocuted... I guess).  How about Ed O'Neill dancing?  LOL!  I like the kid with a bad mouth- he's funny.  The movie certainly has its moments.  You're not supposed to take this movie seriously anyway I understand, because there's supposed to be elements of comedy.  But... eh.  I still have mad love for Andrew Dice's stand-up routine.  Yes the stuff he says is incredibly offensive and disgusting, but it's funny so I'm pleased.  However in movies Andrew's comedy comes up short.  Knowing this, you might want to approach his movies with caution.",1439596800,,1579,4.788888888888889

374114,4,6301888898,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.  His comedic style may or may not work for you, but I think if you start watching it and your entertained you'll be pleased with this one.",1386806400,,1344,4.383064516129032

374174,5,6301888898,"I remember when this movie came out, EVERYBODY bagged on it. Too raunchy, too childish, too this, too that. What nobody seemed to get was that it was also very funny. Sure the beginning had some cheese with elements of the schtick from Dice's act inserted, but it was quick and rather painless. After that, it was an awesome ride!

Look at the cast--Wayne Newton, Gilbert Gottfried, Priscilla Presley, Lauren Holly, Robert Englund, Ed O'Neil, Maddie Corman, David Patrick Kelly...all fabulous. Ed O'Neil and Robert Englund alone are worth the price of admission. Incredible chemistry with Dice. These stars all had small but excellent performances. And as far as comedy goes, there's some really great writing here.

When this came out in 1990, there was a large amount of negative press involving Dice. I believe that many people were put off from seeing the film because of this, never giving it a chance. This was Dice in his prime, and while the movie is flawed, there's so much great material in it that it's definitely worth your time.

Obviously, if you aren't in any way an Andrew Dice Clay fan, you're probably not going to enjoy this film. For everyone else, dig in. If you like well written and acted raunchy comedies that don't pull their punches, this one's for you. Then go get The Change-Up.",1361836800,,1306,4.769911504424779

Back to Hollywoods detective Ford Fairlane, Ed (married with children) O'neal tries to steal the show as police Lt. Amos. And Wayne Newton is fabulous as the corrupt recording studio mogul. And if that's not enough they brought in Robert (Freddie Kruger) Englund as a psychopathic thug. It's as funny and profane as Smokey & the Bandit.",1355011200,,658,4.681034482758621

Ford ""Mr. Rock n' Roll Detective"" Fairlane is experiencing problems, and it's not with the opposite sex. One of them is that all the rock stars pay him with drum sticks, koala bears, food processors and bicycle shorts. Another one of them is that all his employers that want him to find a girl named Zuzu Petals get killed. Why didn't he become a fisherman's detective instead? A must-see for Andrew Dice Clay fans.

374235,2,6301888898,"Very much a film of it's time, Andrew Dice Clay was at the peak of his popularity when he starred in this travesty, which audience's flocked AWAY from.  It's a shame because Dice is a strong screen presence, he'd done some terrific work on TV as young mobster Max Goldman in 'Crime Story'. But playing an amped up version of himself he comes off as a ghastly self parody.

The film is crippled by tone thats all over the place, it simply doesn't know what it wants to be. Even as a vanity project for Dice it's a dud, thanks to the terrible script.

But like a traffic accident on the freeway, you can't look away.

Director Renny Harlin gives this film an unwelcome nasty tone but does move things along in style, with slick cinematography by Oliver Wood. Harlin has great eye for the babes too, the movie has a ton beauties in it (including a young Lauren Holly) who are all, quite inexplicably, attracted to the Diceman.

Wayne Newton is well cast as the vile bad guy.

Harlin used much of this crew for his next film 'Die Hard 2' and hit the big time.",1322870400,,1055,4.32994923857868
374236,4,6301888898,"Clay succeeded famously in clubs and concert arenas and then found himself at 20th Century Fox in a role perfectly tailored to the retro ""greaser"", with a foul mouth, a hard fist...and a soft heart.

Even diehard ADC fans will be surprised at the strength of his performance. This man can act! Can express melancholy, dismay and a sense of ""what's next?"" fun, with great humour.

I saw a long show with Clay back in '89 at a huge auditorium in the Catskills, New York, and it was very good. This led to buying his VHS of the Madison Square Garden concert. I didn't expect a showcase for *acting* talent to the degree that I forgot about his act - and not your run-of-the-mill feminist-era schlemeil man - this dude takes us back to the streets in 1962, leather, pompador, smokes!

At times the sharp but good-natured satire here is lost, however: there are some brilliant swipes at Madonna's first film (title escapes me), the Heavy Metal business, more accurately the turn of the decade music industry, when it appeared that self-implosion was imminent. Billions of bucks made...and the artists...screwed! Not nearly as bad as with the rock and roll originators (by the way, enjoy the great ""cover"" of ""Sea Cruise"" by Dion on the soundtrack), but still bad.

Another guy getting screwed is failed Eastern Rocker cum semi-successful Western Rock and Roll Detective Ford Fairlane, who does not drive a '90 muscle car but an antique (you guessed it) Ford Fairlane, immaculately cared for. It's a ""retret"" of sorts...as is his authentic, 1962 Jimi Hendrix electric guitar.

Now, to the sometimes elusive plot, involving tracking down a homeless kid's Dad *and* tracking down a groupie for no apparent reason...well, it never stalls, never gets sentimental (but wait for the end, not gonna give it away); the action is fast and furious, and the backdrops are always cool. Dice finds himself on the roof of Capitol Records...no symbolism, just Clay in another wild situation.

Great, exhilirating fun watching real rockers of the time, like Vince Neil, watching ""Mister Vegas"", Wayne Newton do a very credible job - if this guy doesn't bring ""realism"" to a movie about the music business, no one does. We even encounter ""Mrs. Presley"" - Priscilla in a light spoof of the film noir widow, mysteriously arriving at Fairlane's desk with a wad of cash.

There should have been at least three sequels..but not to be. Making a solid suspense story permeated with hip humour was not going to do it. The, shall we say, ""Militant Feminist Lobby"", at the time, apparently did want to consider the subtleties of Clay, the value of exploding stereotype; in all fairness, even in this good movie, there are a few things too close to his ""adults only"" club act and so it was good-bye to a major movie career and hello to Cultist artifact...and modest success back on the club circuit.",1313884800,2,2865,4.810975609756097

374294,5,6301888898,"I remember this movie getting a chilly reception at the box office. I remember that even Dice fans where saying that this movie blows. I remember seeing for the first time late 1999 and I liked it. I bought the DVD for a cheap price at a pawn shop and have seen it 5 times since then. Its a fun movie to watch. It amazes me how fans of Andrew Dice Clay could hate this movie. Its exactly what you would expect from a movie with him as the lead role.

Ford Fairlane(Andrew Dice Clay)is sent to find an idiotic groupie named Zuzu Petals(Maddie Corman) by a friend/shock jock named Johnny Crunch(Gilbert Gottfried). His search turns into a murder investigation after the Johnny Crunch gets electrocuted on air. Ford later gets caught in a web of corruption involving a slimy record executive named Julian Grendel(Wayne Newton), a sex scandal involving Julian's former wife Colleen Sutton(Priscilla Pressley) and a theatrical hit man named Smiley(played by Robert Englund with a silly British accent).

Yeah, I know the movie is kind of dopey and can be misogynistic at times but I like watching this movie. Andrew Dice Clay was hilarious in this movie. I like the banter between him and Ed O'Neil's character Lt Amos, a former disco artist of a defunct group called Disco Express. Ford gets into some pretty crazy situations in this movie but its cool to watch. Some of the funniest and coolest one-liners were in this movie. Its mostly comedy with a slice of satire on the music industry in the 90s. Directed by Renny Harlin the precursor to Michael Bay(dont get mad at me you said so yourself), The Adventures Of Ford Fairlane is better than most people give it credit for. It was a wild and fun ride that reminded you of what made 90s movie so cool. Its definitely better than The Adventures Of Pluto Nash and Hudson Hawk. If you're a fan of the Diceman then I don't see how you couldn't like this movie.

He operates a struggling P.I. business with his cute assistant Chazz (Lauren Holly). She's constantly harassing Ford about overdue bills but secretly she loves the big lug. When Ford gets a case involving shock jock Johnny Crunch (Gilbert Gottfried) he thinks his money problems are solved. Within a half hour of talking to Crunch, who wants Ford to find his daughter, Ford finds his new client dead and his own life being threatened by a kinky hitman (Robert Englund). The next morning Ford gets a new client: a beautiful woman named Colleen (Priscilla Presley). Turns out Colleen and Crunch are looking for the same person. Ford's investigation leads him into the music industry where he clashes with a sleazy producer named Julian Grendel (Wayne Newton). Ford soon realizes that between the hitman and Grendel he better find the girl and fast. The film is funny as hell. The Dice is a natural when it comes to acting and he has a tremendous supporting cast to back him up. There's Ed O'Neill as a white rapper (actually  he's a cop), David Patrick Kelly as a pervert with a heart of gold, musicians Morris Day and Vince Neill and countless other familiar faces. Director Renny Harlin is a master at making bad movies look good and he does so here showcasing many L.A. landmarks, like the Capitol building, to great effect. The story isn't the best and things lag a bit towards the end, but all I need is to hear the Diceman end a joke with his signature ""Ohhhh"", and I'm enjoying myself.",1239321600,,1699,4.6072607260726075

374350,4,6301888898,"I'm a firm believer in the fact that there are two kinds of B movies in the world: the ones which take themselves too seriously and the ones which do not. With the latter, both the audience and the moviemakers are in general agreement that the point is to provide entertainment as opposed to creating art or an intense emotional experience. This allows  viewers to relax and gleefully ride along. Here, in Ford Fairlaine, we have a honest, unpretentious B movie that comes with a pompadour of oomph.

As far as plot goes, frankly, this one's not too memorable, but Andrew Dice Clay is/was an underrated comedian. He's really got some fine material in this film. More importantly, the Diceman is an important cultural remnant from the days when people jovially made jokes about one another which were broadly termed ""ethnic humor"" by cultural commentators. Now such jokes are condemned as hate speech and branded with an ism. The offending party, unless they are members of a blessed minority group, are then charged with dehumanization or some other bit of hogwash dreamt up by the out-of-touch and the overpaid. Here Clay presents a dismissive view of women that one cannot find practically anywhere else on earth. He clearly views them as his inferiors, and even though many of his remarks and insults are too severe, one cannot help but look back at those glowing days in which citizens could say them without being labeled haters.

When Dice brokedown on ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" I happened to be watching, and I felt very sorry for him. It may have been the first time I understood how invidious political correctness was. The gist was that sensitive Arsenio informed Clay that his assistant wouldn't come to work that day because she was so offended by Andrew's presence. I wish that I could have spoken for Dice because I would have informed him that those of us who live everyday lives are offended every time we deal with traffic. Our universities and colleges have to stop pretending that they are preparing students for life when really, they are preparing for students for a sixty year ego massage which will never be given. . If one is horrified by the jokes of a guy like Dice then they're going to be in big trouble when they have to deal with bureaucrats or mentally ill individuals spending their days aboard public transportation. Dice is a litmus test, if you can't handle him, it's back to the crib for you. Although, I should mention that the film is actually funny. Many of Clay's asides are hilarious. His character, in case the hate merchants didn't notice, is tongue in cheek. One of my favorite moments is when he plummets from a building and, as everyone is screaming, he says, ""My hair! My hair!"" This is a fine farce and if part of you longs for the days of Archie Bunker, you'll dig this one.",1133654400,14,2821,4.683467741935484

I don't need to recap the film as most of the other reviewers have summed up the story succinctly. Ya gotta love the cameos, Sheila E, Morris Day (remember The Time?), David Bowie, and the cast has Lauren Holly (the sexy redhead cop in Picket Fences...mmmm..wanted her so badly....mhmmm...but she had to kiss Dice...yuuuuuuk!), Ed ONeill, Gilbert Gottfried (in a role that puts Howard Stern to shame!)
I originally bought this movie on VHS because I am a long-time Yello fan and I discovered that Yello scored the movie. I bought it on VHS years ago, watched it once and was disgusted that Yello had put their name on such trash. I could see why Yello never scored another film. Well, I just watched it again, with fresh eyes, and despite the fact that there is not much Yello, other than some clips from their 1990 album Baby (I now understand why Baby was such an uneven album, many of the songs were written for this film and they just don't flow properly in an album format. That or they are too closely tied to the same storyline as the film.) Yes, despite the fact that there was less fresh Yello in the film than I wanted, the film is actually well crafted. I planned on watching just a bit of the beginning to check out again how much Yello is in the film, and I simply couldn't stop watching. Two hours later and I discover there is a DVD version. While it is not my standard fare in humor and style, I am going to have to get the DVD to see what it looks like in widescreen format.
My first watching years ago was on a small television, so perhaps that had something to do with my first impression of ""::shrug::"" Watching the VHS version on my projector the other night was a completely different story. You really need to consider how easy it is to get bored by a film when it is on a tiny TV screen. Watching it in a larger format or in the theatres gives a whole new twist and perspective to the viewing. Definitely worth the trouble here.
While I am not fond of the humor, I give the movie a solid three stars, maybe 3-1/2 or 3-3/4. Sorry Dice, I just cant bring myself to give you four stars...no dice.... Definitely worth the time and effort to buy in DVD and view on a large screen, and enjoy the soundtrack on something better than crappy old worn-out VHS.",1078790400,2,2413,4.44920993227991

374451,5,6301888898,"I remember the early days of Don Rickles, the master of insult humor. His career was saved when his Las Vegas crowd rallied to let the public know that he was really a nice guy. Unfortunately, the Dice-Man didn't have that support, and his 80's update of Rickles-type humor was blown out of proportion by a misguided, politically-correct public that wouldn't know a funny joke if it was strapped to their privates. Dice IS funny, and he IS a nice guy. His humor is probably a ""GUY"" thing, but he talks no differently than anyone I've known who lived in a college dorm. Okay. Enough about the misunderstood Dice. ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"", an early effort from Renny Harlin, is always funny and always entertaining. The screenplay is clever, a direct parody of dumb detective films, with many original ideas, tailor-made to the many talents of Andrew Dice Clay. Dice is quite charming, always self-effacing and having a great time. The assembled cast is great, with Gilbert Gottfried in a natural role, a fine nasty performance from Wayne Newton, as well as Robert Englund (in a non-Freddy role, but still nasty). Lauren Holly is a stabilizing factor, and Priscilla Presley (remember the ""Naked Gun"" films?) is as straight as ever. Really enjoyable is Maddie Corman (the little sister from ""Some Kind of Wonderful"") as Zuzu Petals (I've not been able to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" without thinking of Maddie...) Ed O'Neill's rendition of ""Booty Time"" may stick with you. Andrew Dice Clay's humor may not appeal to all, but this is a fun film and the Dice-Man is quite endearing.

374452,3,6301888898,"I never cared for the comedy of Andrew ""Dice"" Clay. I wasn't offended or disgusted by his stand-up routine; I just didn't find any of his jokes funny. Back in the summer of 1990, when the theater I worked at got a poster for The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, I wasn't the least bit interested, and figured it would bomb. I was right, and it never even showed at that particular movie house.
So, why did I rent it on VHS the day it was released? Two reasons: I'm a big Robert Englund fan, and I'd seen just about everything else in the video store. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be GOOD. Clay has a commanding onscreen persona, the rest of the cast is great (especially  27 year-old Lauren Holly), and it was funny. Granted, the humor isn't for all tastes. (This is the Diceman, after all.) But those in the mood for a well-done comedy/mystery should find much to like. Clay never really took off as a movie star, which is too bad. Check out his bravura performance as a villain in the otherwise lame No Contest. Too bad it wasn't in a better film.

374491,5,6301888898,"""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" is the greatest movie of all times. It has an all-star cast, awesome soundtrack and enough one-liners to fill a book. The movie is exceptionally well put together by the prodigiously talented Renny Harlin (who also directed Die Hard 2), and performed and written with style. Harlin (who reportedly left most of the editing to his crew so he could move on to DIE HARD 2) has once again proven himself to be one of the finest visual stylists in Hollywood. FORD FAIRLANE is only Harlin's fifth film, but he has already defined a style of his own, and his use of the camera is amazingly assured. Full of rich nighttime images and wonderfully lit interiors (shot by DIE HARD 2's cinematographer Oliver Wood), FORD FAIRLANE is a treat for the eyes. The pacing is quick, and the comic book-like transitions work nicely, but as Harlin proved with DIE HARD 2, his strongest talent is his handling of action sequences. The two best scenes in FORD FAIRLANE are action-oriented. The first is an extended car chase through a graveyard (chock full of necrophilia jokes and rolling corpses), and the second is an outstanding sequence that takes place on the Capitol Records Tower. Of course, there is something in this movie to offend just about anyone. However, the screenplay does play it safe by eventually backing away from every single ""taboo"" it almost breaks: the corpse Clay jokes about having sex with turns out to be a living woman; a cute Koala bear is found dead, strung up by his neck, only to be brought back later wearing a neck brace. Trying to be both ""bad"" and ""good,"" the screenplay definitely wants to have its cake and eat it too. THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE is an exceptionally well-made film that is everything you could ever want in an Andrew Dice Clay movie; it's vulgar, tasteless, nasty, cynical, and very funny.",1001635200,,1862,4.7323076923076925

I accidently stumbled across this movie but have seen it with my friends over 30 times. The story: Andrew Dice Clay plays Ford Fairlane a Rock 'n' Roll detective who is hired to track down a groupie.  As in all movies, certain elements have been withheld from our hero and so he blindly stumbles into all sorts of trouble. This movie was a lot of fun to watch and my only regret is that I haven't been able to work out how to make the perfect 'Sambuca Milkshake' - but I'm having fun trying!",981244800,2,606,4.206896551724138
374535,5,6301888898,"Man, the majority of people hate this movie because it stars Andrew Dice Clay, and they haven't even watched it.  That's not very fair if you ask me.  I also must say that this movie is ahead it's time if you ask me.  I mean look at Ameerican Pie, and There's Something About Mary, they have more offensive things than the language in this movie.  Anyway let's talk plot shall we?
So the Diceman is Ford Fairlane, rock and roll detective. Priscilla Presley hires him to find this girl (who would later be the peek-a-boo girl at the end of Swingers) but she doesn't give Ford the full story.  Then Gilbert Gottfried (as a shockjock) hires Ford to find the same girl, but with a different story.  Anyway, hilarity and wackiness ensues.  There is a funeral for Vince Neil (too bad it's not real) Robert Patrick Kelly as a stalker, Robert Enguland as a psychotic killer (without claws, that's a different movie), The Columbia Records tower, zippy one-liners, Wayne Newton and lots more craziness.
I must also point out that this movie really got me into the band Yello (they did Oh Yeah from Ferris Bueller's Day Off) because they did some of the soundtrack.  My main problem though is the fact that I live in a very PC city (Seattle, so it's hard to find on VHS.  I've seen it on TBS a few times but it's edited and that defeats the purpose, and you lose some great lines.  I really would not mind it being on DVD either.  I mean look at all the other Renny Harlin movies out, Cutthroat Island and Die Hard 2 are out but not this?  Come on people, and when you do release it make it a keepcase, not those flimsy cases that Warner Brothers uses.  I'm getting sidetracked.

374542,4,6301888898,"Andrew Dice Clay fans are not the only people who can enjoy ""The adventures of Ford Fairlane"". It should hold an appeal for anyone who  admire the conviction of people who travel a path very different from the  mainstream of humanity. Ford Fairlane is definitely one of these types of  characters.

Wearing a leather jacket with the collar up, tight  black jeans, slicked up hair and shiny, black, pointy, leather boots, Ford  tears up the screen with his sharp sexist wit. He is so conscious of being  cool that he often runs the risk of losing his life.

This film has  more quotes than you can shake a stick at and rightly so. The script would  have to be one of the best around. Lines like the following:
  ""Johnny was the only person that could ever out-gross me""
  ""We used to have gross-out contests""
 ""I would cough up a  wad of phlegm on the table and Johnny would say 'Nice try' and pull out a  straw""

Ford Fairlane is a rock and  roll detective. By that I  mean he specialises in investigative cases in the music industry.  Specifically, in Los Angeles. The story takes Ford through an investigation  given to him by his good friend Johnny Crunch, a radio shock jock, who is  killed shortly thereafter.

The case eventually manages to suck in  two other investigations. One of which concerns the recent death of a heavy  metal band's lead singer. The other is a hundred dollar case to find  the  Father of a kid that idolizes Ford and emulates him in all things.

Despite a number of premature attempts by Fairlane, the case is  eventually closed but only at the cost of his home, his girl and his best  friend. All of which would be sad if the film were not the frighteningly  funny comedy that it is.

So, if you are getting tired of being  politically correct, want to objectify women, drive a tasteless car and  produce knock-em-dead one liners at the drop of a prat, then settle  yourself with a six-pack and some snacks while enjoying ""The  Adventures of Ford Fairlane"".",957312000,,1988,4.529745042492918

7816327,5,6301888898,"The story of the Diceman is one of persecution by the cult of political correctness.  Diceman was labeled misogynistic by the usual suspects namely NOW, famed apologists for the Clintons and enablers of Weinstein.  Prior to an appearance on ""SNL"" now forgotten cast member Nora Dunn refused to appear on the show in protest claiming solidarity with her sisters in arms.  Dunn was last seen on an episode of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"".  Unbelievable.  After this flick's predictable drubbing by the critics and lukewarm box office Dice was forced to water down his act because of boycotts and cancellations.  Dice's neutering alienated him from his core audience effectively ending his career.  He experienced a slight career boost by a scene stealing turn in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" years later.  Ironically the Woodman is now in the crosshairs of same minions.  In light of the recent hypocrisy in Hollywood this flick makes Dice seem enlightened.  Think about it.  In the end he gets the girl and a family.  ""Ford Fairlane"" is the perfect vehicle for Dice.  It's pure rock 'n' roll.  It's setting in the sleazy music industry fits him to a tee.  Really good performances from unexpected sources.  Any flick that get really really good work out of Wayne Newton, Priscilla Presley, and Gilbert Gottfried can't be all bad.  The central mystery is not only serviceable it's downright plausible.  Probably has Clive Davis spinning in his grave if he's dead.  Damn the critics.  ""Ford Fairlane"" is essential.
