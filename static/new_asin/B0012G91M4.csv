3088979,2,B0012G91M4,"I have to agree with a reviewer from another website: in the right hands, this would have been a splendid production.  Instead, anyone in the US who grew up with Scooby Doo will find themselves in familiar plot territory.  I'm told the gratuitous panty shots are a fixture of the original manga, so I'd be almost willing to overlook this bizarre feature of the anime if the creators showed more sensitivity to the emotional content of certain scenes and didn't avail every possible opportunity.  This show was almost embarrassing to watch, but I think it has certain appeal: the premise of the show is clever, the protagonists are all likable and humorous, and the emotional play between Tsukune and Moka is touchingly rendered in spite of every possible attempt by the producers to turn this show into absolute garbage.  It was perhaps this push and pull between sincere wit and thoughtless churn that convinced me to sit through the entire season in the hopes it would get better.  Unfortunately, it didn't.",1241049600,3,1009,4.87719298245614

8245834,5,B0012G91M4,I had never watched manga. But when i watched this anime it was very good. So bought season 1&2 and i do not regret doing so.,1340668800,,125,3.8461538461538463
8245835,5,B0012G91M4,"This is one of those series I started watching because it sounded different.  After watching the first few episodes, I was hooked. It's just mindless fun. It uses all the popular Anime ideas...

1) Great looking babes
2) Vampires and other *kinky* monsters
3) Shy guy is the target of all the hot girls
4) High school
5) Bouncy Bouncy
6) Hero complex on the guys part
7) Panties - lots of them
8) Deadly Obsessive nut case babes
9) Dual personalities
10) Lots of adult humor
11) Strange critter giving commentary

It's a dark comedy, a little simple at points (friends solve everything), geared towards teenage guys and simple minded adults  ;-)  It's quite a bit like Sekirei in style and humor. If you likes Sekirei, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, Elfin Leid and the like, you'll enjoy this series as well.

There's an unusual assortment of characters: A dominatrix tutor (""study for me baby!""), Goth ice queen, Master vampire with confidence issues, love-crazed kid - and they all have it in for our poor, shy kid (poor? with all that attention?! It's also got a great soundtrack plus good opening and end title tracks.

The big plot twist? It's a high school for monsters, all in human form, with a promise to kill any human found on the grounds. Tsukune Aono is human - he has no right to be there, but his father found an acceptance letter dropped by a monster and used it to enroll Tsukune. He was not ""accidentally enrolled"" - his dad scammed the high school. Anyway, his human scent is irresistible to monsters - they all think he is a fellow monster that smells great. Only his vampire love interest, Moka, knows his secret.

I wish people would stop comparing Anime to the Magna. It's two different things. The Anime stands alone and is entertaining and funny as hell.

BTW, season 1 and season 2 are out on DVD. Season 3 may be in the works.....",1331683200,,1853,4.557228915662651

8245837,4,B0012G91M4,"I have to agree that the manga is much better, but I wouldn't have read the manga if I hadn't enjoyed the anime, there are a surplus of unnecessary pantsu shots, but many parts are very funny, I especially love Yukari's mother with the terminal velocity brass cooking pans from orbit. The only jarring note for me was the nudity in the bath by 12 year old Yukari.",1305676800,,363,4.352941176470588
8245838,5,B0012G91M4,As we all know Ecchi animes tend not to have much character development and not a whole lot of story and tend to seem like every other Ecchi anime out there. This is an ecchi anime with good character development and a decent story although it could have been a little better. All in all it is  great anime although it does not closely follow the Manga at all but it stems out and forms its own story in a way and actually works which is a rare find.,1303084800,6,450,4.056179775280899
8245839,4,B0012G91M4,"I a personal lover for Anime and Manga, I cannot help but say that I really enjoyed this show. I notice that many do not seem to like it because it does not follow the Manga very well. However, there are many Anime's and Manga that do not follow one or the other. There are only 4 shows I have seen out of maybe 30 or more that followed the Manga perfectly. I do think that one is bad or one is great. I think in both perspectives they are amazing. Its kind of the same thing with Harry Potter. Many people enjoyed the books and didn't enjoy the movies. And those who didn't read the books thought the movies were amazing. Its all opinion I suppose. Sadly my mother purchased season 1 and 2 for me and the images were burned into the DVD and sadly I couldn't finish the whole season. Neither season actually. If anyone has better copies or know where I could purchase them please let me know. Thank you.

P.S.- I'm sorry for those that didn't enjoy there series. There are many other shows I hope you find more enjoyable.",1301875200,,1021,4.235897435897436
8245840,5,B0012G91M4,"Okay, I've got to say something as a person who watched the anime first:

IT'S GOOD :D I'm not asking for anyone to agree with me, but I thought it was good enough to put the whole first season on my wish list...

While I believe that an anime should follow a manga closely like Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, sometimes it's just nice to enjoy an anime for what it is on its own, and this one definitely has its good points. Events such as the characters meeting does happen fairly quickly, however once you meet them you see that they all possess the qualities that make anime what it is. It just doesn't get better than a sweet, somewhat shy girl with supernatural powers (i.e. turns into a vampire when her necklace is removed), a little loli witch, a sexy succubus (just to name a few) and the typical everyman type of guy who is stuck in the middle of it all. I liked this series because you can get attached to the characters and the plot is not so absurd that you can't take it seriously. At times there will be aspects of the show that annoy, but I have found from watching the show several times that it is just these things that make me laugh sometimes. Humor (even if it is panty shots and such) is definitely this anime's strong point, in that the humor makes the characters seem much more human than they would seem otherwise. I found this series to be more entertaining than a typical harem/ slice of life, and I value it for that.",1297468800,,1448,4.319852941176471
8245841,2,B0012G91M4,"As a fan of the manga, i was really anticipating seeing the funny yet dark,serious, and complex plot brought to life. Instead i got a light bit of fluff that is agressively devoted to fanservice without much substance whatsoever. They turned the main character, who actually becomes pretty awesome in the manga, into an indecisive twit who is always being saved by his harem of beautiful girls. (i'm all for girl power but this is supposed to be a story about the guys growth and desire to protect his friends, not just about the panty flashing a** kicking girls).
there is a panty shot about once every 2 minutes in every episode, and even more gratuitous cleavage shots. instead of having any consistant plot its more of a monster of the week type show.
i was terribly dissapointed in this because it could easily have been an great anime, a touch dark at times, a bit violent, but ultimaly a story about strength, growth, and friendship (with a little romance thrown in).
if you are looking for light-heart ecchi based anime this is for you, but if you love the manga then do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. hell, don't even rent it.
stay far far away.",1262736000,3,1164,4.5476190476190474
8245842,1,B0012G91M4,"I was drawn to this series after viewing the new Moka Transformed PVC statue and bought the books in the series. After reading the first book, I was hooked and turned to the anime hoping for the same entertainment. As noted by another reviewer, the anime does not follow the manga in any real appreciable way. In many instances, the stories are changed completely from the original series ( for example, Mizore is not saved from an attacking teacher; and Ruby's guardian is a figment of her imagination rather than a real individual as in the manga). This series is fun to watch just to see the characters come to life, but I cannot help but think it could have been done so much better.",1248134400,10,687,4.504
8245843,2,B0012G91M4,"The Manga is by far the better of the two. I have the whole Anime series and it doesn't follow the Manga for very long. The way the characters are introduced is unnecessarily sped up. We meet Moka, the succubus, witch, and the Snow Girl in five episodes after that it gets reduced to a silly Harem Anime series. Its light on action and heavy on panty shots. The second season isn't much better, we meet Moka's sister and the parents of the other girls, but the panty shots which were INSANE in the first season are censored by an annoying bat almost all the time! I didn't really like this one but I loved the Manga and would like to see a third season, God willing...",1241395200,3,668,4.267716535433071
