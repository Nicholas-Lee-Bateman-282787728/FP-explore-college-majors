8380649,5,B002TUU5SG,"This DVD contains a diverse line-up of styles ranging from blues to jazz to R&B, featuring Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Ethel Waters, Anita O'Day and Dinah Wasington.

I'll address each performaner in the sequence in wich they appear:

Billie Holiday - most of Lady Day's performances were marred by poor video and/or sound quality. Of the 23 performances on the DVD, she has eight: The Blues Are Brewin', Easy to Remember, What a Little Moonlight Can Do, Foolin' Myself, Fine and Mellow, Strange Fruit, Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone, (I Love You) Porgy. My favorite is Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone, although she turned in an excellent performance of Strange Fruit. The performance of Fine and Mellow is from her 1957 last session with Lester Young, which never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Despite the poor video and audio of Billie's performances, it is always a pleasure to see and hear her.

Nina Simone - tracks 9 through 14 are devoted to Nina, with the following songs: I'll Look Around, Improvisation, When I Was in My Prime, Zungo, For All We Know, There Is a Book of Love. Most of this material is from a 1961 concert, and it not only showcases her unique voice and singing style, but also her mastery of the piano. If she had never sung a note, she would (or should) be remembered for her compositional and playing abilities. She was blessed with a natural talent and training at Juliard, which she was unfortunately able to complete. Most of her work was deeply rooted in African music, and the performances here show it.

Ethel Waters - sadly this DVD contains a single performance that does not do her the justice she deserves. The sole clip is of her performing QUicksand with the Basie Orchestra.  As the first African-American superstar her life and work should be of interest to any jazz fan, and I feel that this DVD should have contained more than a single example.

Anita O'Day - a remarkable singer who had the ability to sing in crazy fast tempos that made her the darling of the big band era. Her gift for managing fast tempos added significantly to Gene Krupa's orchestra. On the DVD she has two performances - Thanks for the Boogie Ride and Let Me Off Uptown, both of which were with Krupa. Note the edgy inter-racial flirting on Thanks for the Boogie Ride, which was scandalous in the 1940s. Also notice the tempo at which she sings it.

Dinah Washington - Dinah is one of my favorite blues and R&B singers who has six tracks. The complete track list of songs she performs on this DVD are Only a Moment Ago, Such a Night, I Don't Hurt Anymore, My Lean Baby, Lover Come Back to Me, Send Me to 'Lectric Chair. The latter, a Bessie Smith song, is my favorite because Bessie is another of my favorite vocalists.

Overall this is enjoyable for recreational watching, as well as for surveying the styles of each vocalist and her performance. Modern day divas and aspiring divas should get a lot of pointers from the DVD.",1334534400,,2968,4.576271186440678
