489238,5,6302655897,I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT PLAYED IN THE MOVIES.  THE STORY STAYED WITH ME EVER SINCE. THERE WAS ALWAYS A WONDERFUL CONNECTION BETWEEN LIZ TAYLOR AND MONTGOMERY CLIFT. THIS MOVIE REFLECTED THAT CONNECTION IN ALL  IT'S GLORY. THE STORY LINE WAS STRANGE BUT STILL EMBODIED THE CONFLICT OF  GOOD AND EVIL. I DO THINK THIS IS A SAMPLING FROM FILM NOIR THAT DESERVES  TO BE SEEN.,946512000,3,378,4.514705882352941
489287,4,6302655897,"Its sad to think that for most people the name Elizabeth Taylor draws up images of an overweight overly made up jewelry bedecked fading actress known more for her long time involvement with Richard Burton or that she was friends with Michael Jackson. Taylor was so much more than that. Tabloids seem to rule though so the rest is forgotten. Ignored is the fact she began as a child actress, that she moved on to leading lady roles in some classic films and that she displayed a great acting prowess in movies like WHOS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLFE actually winning for that performance and that she was nominated 5 times winning twice. Its easy to see why she would be nominated when watching this film.

The story opens in a New Orleans mental hospital trying to stay afloat and seeking funding. Their star attraction is a young psycho-surgical doctor named Dr. John Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift). Using new techniques hes doing all he can for his patients, never rushing to use the methods he masters but trying to find other solutions when possible.

John is sent by hospital administrator Dr. Hockstader (Albert Dekker) to talk to wealthy Violet Venerable (Katherine Hepburn) about her niece Catherine Holly (Taylor). Catherine was there with Violets son Sebastian when he died and has since told a tale that Violet claims is mere babbling. She claims to want to help Catherine but in truth she wants her lobotomized in hopes of silencing her.

John doesnt just randomly do the procedure though, instead trying to help his patients. Meeting with Catherine he hears her story and realizes that something is hidden in the deepest recesses of her mind that won't come out and help her heal. His job remains throughout the film to help Catherine find out what it is that is causing her such mental trauma and at the same time why this news would cause Violet to want him to perform such an operation on the girl.

Based on the play by Tennessee Williams with a screenplay by Gore Vidal, the story is filled with references to a most controversial topics at the time, homosexuality. The inferences are there from the start so it shouldnt be a spoiler to realize that Sebastian had something to hide that his domineering mother is unwilling to discuss or contemplate all the while knowing the truth. Catherine is a nave character here never realizing quite what Sebastian is. It is her innocence and the determination of Violet to protect her own mental illusions that makes up the drama in the film.

The movie takes its time to unravel the story it tells and does so with skill. The performances on display show actors at the top of their game though much has been said about the problems faced by Clift while shooting. Having suffered an injury in a car wreck he was dependent on drugs and alcohol and was trying to get over that dependency. It was Taylor, the top box office star at the time, who wielded her power of popularity to force the studio to hire Clift, one of the many displays of compassion she showed people during her lifetime.

Both Hepburn and Taylor were nominated for their performances but both lost. The film was a financial hit at the time but now seems unknown to most. Offering a solid story thats sad and hopefully it will be rediscovered on disc.

Twilight Time has done a great job of presenting this film in the most beautiful way imaginable. While a black and white film their handling of the presentation here offers the most crisp and clean looking copy Ive ever seen, a 1080p hi def edition. Extras are limited to an isolated music and effects track and the original trailer. As always the disc is limited to just 3,000 copies so if interested by one today.",1506988800,,3685,4.668721109399075

489291,3,6302655897,"Review of Suddenly, Last Summer
Hot Toasty Rag, July 20, 2017

If you're a Tennessee Williams fan, you probably know a little bit about his personal life. Tennessees sister was mentally ill and underwent a lobotomy in the 1940s. The procedures aftermath was devastating, and she was institutionalized for the remainder of her life. Knowing this, and knowing the persona of his overbearing mother, its easy to see Suddenly, Last Summer as a partially autobiographical work, as were most of his plays. In this story, a strong, domineering mother tries to convince a young doctor to perform a lobotomy on her unstable niece.

Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift became lifelong friends in real life after their pairing in A Place in the Sun, and not only do audiences see them reunited for a third time in this film, but its interesting and entertaining to see the reversed dynamic. Before, Monty was striving for the upper-class Liz, and in this one, hes the classy doctor she keeps trying to shock and flirt with. They both give excellent, Tennessee Williams-esque performances; it sometimes seems like Monty was born to act in his plays.

Katharine Hepburn plays the mother. She was known for her forceful characterizations in her later years, and when you watch Suddenly, Last Summer, its easy to see why. Kate and Liz were pinned against each other in the Best Actress category during the 1960 Oscar ceremony, but neither one took home the gold. The following year, Liz won a make-up Oscar for BUtterfield 8, so if you watch this movie and think she was robbed, you can relax knowing she was honored for her next film.",1500508800,,1622,4.8483754512635375

489293,5,6302655897,"This is a modern classic. The play upon which it is based was written by Tennessee Williams and the screenplay by him and Gore Vidal. The acting in the film earned the two female leads Academy Award nominations. The play/film focuses on a man who died, We do not know how he died or why. A woman, his cousin, was with him and was disturbed by how he died. She wiped it from her memory. We do not know why. The man's mother, who had a strange relationship with her son, wants the woman lobotomized because she claims the woman is crazy and needs the treatment. She offers a million dollars to an institution to have them cut out part of her brain, making her forget. We do not know what is really prompting the mother. What should cousin forget?

489510,5,6302655897,"Tennessee Williams play always has something that touches me. I am not a fan nor watched a lot of his theater play or his films but whenever I saw the movies based on his play, I can feel it that they have something that has deep meaning or something that remainds for days. Something that makes me think for long time even after the moive is finished.
In this movie Elizabeth Tayler suffers from mental problem after witnessing his cousin's death.  Montgomery Clift, a brain doctor decides to help her. When him and Elizabeth and the aunt of her's who is played by Katharin Hapburn all got together, Montgomery pull out everything in Elizabeth's mind to cure her. That is a very long scene. From that moment, the doctor figures out that the real problem is not her but her aunt.
That is the main point from this film.
Katharin played her evil roll so well that she even made me shake and my hair all stand up, if there's a word like that.
There are too many dialogues but the last scene was a memorable and I cannot complain about the long dialogues at all since William's plays are all like that.
Elizabeth and Hapburn are so good that Montgomery's acting was almost invsible.
Two main actresses were alomst like growling the whole time. I never seen one like that before.
I don't see classic movies that much. But this is a pleasant surprise.
The movie was shot in Black and white and was 1.85:1. Full screen for the widescreen TV.
The location was very limited and I liked it that way.
I also personally thought that Hapburn was brave that she appeared herself in the screen even after she was aged. She was always remembered when she was young and beautiful for me. But not in this film. She was old and grumpy.
If you want to experience some movie that has really good acting with spark through the whole movie, you should check this out.",1455235200,2,1844,4.455621301775148

489744,5,6302655897,"Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal, who co-wrote the brilliant screenplay with Williams, based on his play, both had problematic mothers, and Vidal's, by all accounts, was the mother from hell. So these two towering talents, found their revenge in this thrilling drama. In lesser
hands this wouldn't have worked so brilliantly, but with three leads of this stature, a top director, and a brilliant supporting cast, it becomes one of the most electrifying adult movies I can think of. The screenplay, with it's biting, poetic wit and symbolism, is a cracker, and Katherine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor are given fantastic material to get their teeth into. They have never been better, and Monty Clift was a good enough actor to know not to try to steal their big moments. So it's heady stuff. The entire sequence when Taylor  reveals what did happen to cousin Sebastian last summer, is brilliant, riveting movie making. It's also wickedly funny. Mercedes McCambrige is hilariously false as yet
another mother from hell, with her eyes full of greed, and Gary Raymond is a perfect physical fit as Liz's ruthless brother. It's a hell of a
movie. And like All About Eve, it's as much fun to watch, as it is to listen to. But some viewers on this site are taking the story far too literally, which is not what Williams intended. Sebastian's demise is based on the myth of Dionysus, who suffered a similar fate. It's a classic, and I love it.
  For those of you who are interested in the original one act play, there is a good television version available on Youtube with Maggie Smith as
Violet, Rob Lowe miscast as Doctor Sugar, and an excellent Natasha Richardson as Cathy, among others, in which the great Maggie Smith, struggles mightily with a Southern accent. What is interesting about the original version, though is not how different it is to the film, as everyone says - it's how similar it is. The film is expanded, and well, mostly with potent scenes in the asylum, but all the crucial, lengthy dialogue is not Gore Vidal's at all, as he inferred. It is all, pure Tennessee William's. Check it out. And many thanks to whoever it was who posted it. It should be on DVD too.",1426204800,2,2175,4.703412073490814

The issues of repressed homosexuality and denial are still as relevant today as they were then.  It definitely is a film that once seen will not be forgotten.  The sets and lighting were phenomenal and the black and white film added to the darkness of the film subject.  It showed the avarice and greed that existed in that family and the role of the young beautiful woman to procure for her cousin Sebastian.

490012,5,6302655897,"I loved everything about this movie.  To start with, there is incredible acting from Katherine Hepburn, Mercedes McCambridge, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The movie opens with Montgomery Clift, as a psychiatrist and neurosurgeon, performing a lobotomy in a state hospital. A lot of the movie takes place inside the walls of a state psychiatric hospital, and that theme was titillating during that time in history.  The movie was supposed to take place in 1937, but the movie was made in 1959. It was just 3 years later, in 1962, that Kennedy was in office, and that the U.S. closed all the state run psychiatric facilities in the real world. There was a lot of interest within the public about what went on behind the walls of ""mental hospitals"". There was a lot of interest in Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift romantically, and rumors about Clift's homosexuality.  Put all this together with the plot of the movie, and you have a huge audience. It was unbelievably easy to rent through Amazon. The movie was on my computer in less than 30 seconds.

I remember being a child when the movie came out and hearing adults whispering about the movie.  Of course, my curiosity was peaked.  I would ask my mom over and over to tell me what the movie was about - what everyone was talking about. I never really found out all the angles.  When I rented this movie, I watched it three times back to back, absorbing every sentence, every nuance by the cast.

I still can't believe that the movie made it through censorship. I read that the cast was not allowed to say ""homosexuality"" and not refer to it during the filming.  The first time I saw the movie, in my twenties, I really didn't understand it. I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about. This is a great movie for today's audiences. It was ahead of it's time. Watching it recently, I was at the edge of my seat.  It won't appeal to everyone.  I was a nursing student when I got part of my psychiatric clinical experience in a similar institution in Canada. I know those places existed. There were patients there who had lobotomies. For me,the movie has everything, wrapped up in one production. It's still controversial....and it's an extraordinary piece of film.",1377388800,10,2234,4.673469387755102

490095,4,6302655897,"On the face of it SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER is an implausible piece.  Why would anyone find Mrs. Venable (Katharine Hepburn) attractive, so much so that they would willingly agree to have her pimp for her son Sebastian? And how could Dr. Cuprowicz (Montgomery Clift) continue in his role as psychiatrist if he fell in love with Catharine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor)?  And why does Catharine need a truth serum to be able to reach into her own mind to disclose what happened ""suddenly, last summer""?

However Joseph L. Mankiewicz's stark filming, coupled with great performances from the three protagonists, help to redeem the piece.  With its intelligent use of shadows, lights and shades, Mankiewicz's staging conjures up a sinister world in which everyone is quick to judge Catharine insane without treating her as a human being.  Filmed entirely in the studio (in Britain's Shepperton Studios), the film's world is both claustrophobic and oppressive; just the kind of environment where people (not only Catharine but also Mrs. Venable) try to suppress the truth about themselves and their relationship to Sebastian.

The characters inhabit a world that does not like the truth very much, especially when it is both unsavory and traumatic.  However Williams' and Gore Vidal's script shows the importance of acknowledging that truth, for it only by doing so that the characters can come to terms with difference, especially sexual difference.  Catharine understands this by the end; Mrs. Venable willfully shuns it by returning into a fantasy-world inhabited solely by herself and her (now dead) son.

The performances are just excellent: Taylor's intense characterization - magnified by Mankiewicz's fondness for the close-up - contrasts with Hepburn's more languid acting-style.  Montgomery Clift plays a firm but fair psychiatrist, supported by Albert Dekker as his wrong-headed boss.",1362700800,,1880,5.363945578231292

McCambridge minces about with a silly, shrill drawl and looks ridiculous.

The year is 1937, the place is a State Hospital in New Orleans. ""Psycho-surgery"" is a new cure for schizophrenia. It destroys part of the brain. There is no money in the budget for better conditions. A letter from Mrs. Violet Venable, the widow of a Big Landowner, offers funding to Lyonsview. Mrs. Venable wears white for mourning, the favorite color of her son Sebastian. He died last summer in Europe. Her garden is like a jungle. One plant is a Venus Fly-Trap.[Symbolism?] Sebastian was a ""poet"". His cousin has ""dementia praecox"" and is in a private nursing home. Violet talks a lot about her past with her son, then Cathy's insane babbling is about Sebastian. The ""Sebastian Venable Foundation"" can provide funding for a new building.

""What a blessing to them to be peaceful!"" [Who appears loony here?] Violet talks about the sea turtles that lay eggs in the beach sand. The hatchlings scamper to the sea while being attacked by hungry birds. The cruelty of Mother Nature? Sebastian's clothes are given to his cousin who will go to college. Cathy was with Sebastian when he died. Doctor Cukrowicz meets Catherine. She smokes (which is forbidden) then puts out the butt by burning the nursing Sister! [Proud and spiteful?] She is placed in isolation. Inmates in Lyonsview are caged for life. Cathy talks about Sebastian and his family; they used people. Cathy speaks about her memories. She talks about a Mardi Gras Ball where she visited the Dueling Oaks. [Did she do wrong?] She talks about Sebastian. ""How did he die?"" Can she remember? She remembers the noise on the beach but nothing else. ""I can't remember!""

Cathy is sent to Lyonsview. They will have funding for a new building for ""neurosurgery"" paid for by Mrs. Venable. Cathy is given a private room. The will of Sebastian leaves $50,000 to Cathy and her mother and brother. [A huge sum in 1937.] A lobotomy is for ""hopeless patients"". Cathy sees the male patients who react to her presence. An injection calms her while she talks about last year. ""He never saw the northern lights."" Sebastian was chaste, says his mother. She meets Katherine, who accuses her of paying her mother to sign for that operation. Is Violet jealous of Cathy? Their talk shows their conflicts. Were they used as bait by Sebastian? Cathy watches the female patients, they laugh at her. ""Please, no!"" Cathy is accused of starting a riot.

How soon can he operate? They all visit the Venable mansion. [No servants?] Cathy gets an injection to help her remember. She reacts. She talks about last summer after the night at Dueling Oaks. [Does this behavior suggest a problem?]  She traveled to Europe with her cousin Sebastian. What really happened? She talks about being on the beach. Sebastian met younger men there. He took little white pills for his heart. The boys made music with primitive percussion instruments. This band of musicians followed Sebastian, he ran up the street until he was surrounded. He screamed once, so did Cathy. The police came and found his body, which was mutilated. Cathy cries. Violet mistakes the Doctor for Sebastian! [Who's crazy here?] The girl's story sounds true. Cathy will be sent home. There seems to be a happy ending. [Does this ""talking cure"" really work?]

This story is a warning against letting great wealth control society. There is no age limit or sanity check for these rulers. A ""big landowner"" describes a feudal aristocracy, still a danger to people and democracy today. Are the idle rich inherently decadent? It could also warn against using a State Hospital to suppress an unwanted person (as ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""). The Spanish Civil War began in 1936. Why did Sebastian Venable visit then? Was he on a secret mission that failed? [Somerset Maugham wrote the book ""Ashenden"".]",1345248000,,3818,4.866153846153846
490153,5,6302655897,"Tennessee Williams loved to shock his audiences and by the time this adaptation of his stage play was filmed, audiences had come to expect shock from Tennessee, usually having something to do with repressed sexual behavior. Back in 1960, Tennessee Williams was also probably the most familiar and accomplished playwright in America, having had all his major stage successes transformed into motion pictures.

One on-line reviewer wrote that she was expecting a love story and was repulsed to find this film instead. I find that rather hard to believe. Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal did not write movies like A GIDGET and, if one didn't already know that, one look at the cover photo should dispel any such silly anticipation.

This movie is about the struggle between the truth, no matter how ugly, and the  power provided by Money.

At the time of this movie, Miss Taylor was the number one female Box-Office star in America and a scandalous delight in the Tabloids. So, the studio pushed this as a new Liz Taylor movie and used photographs of Taylor in a white bathing suit to sell the movie. The rumors going around said that when Taylor donned the white bathing suit, it became transparent. Actually, this was true and was mentioned in the original script. In the movie, it's depicted in a flashback. Well, Columbia would have had a hard time selling tickets if they had promoted the film as having anything to do with Homosexuality and cannibalism!

This film, set in 1936, concerns itself with the fate of one Catherine Holly, (Taylor), who has been institutionalized to stop her from ""babbling"" as her wealthy Aunt Violet Venable (Hepburn) calls it, about the events surrounding the death of Cathy's cousin (and Violet's son) Sebastian Venable, who, although dead before the film begins, is very much a part of this story. As Sebastian is memorialized in flashbacks, the audience will see him from behind but never his face.

Montgomery Clift, in a beautifully understated performance that often goes unnoticed, plays Dr. Cucrowitz, a young neurosurgeon whose specialty is a now outmoded procedure called a lobotomy. Lobotomies were used to pacify deranged patients who were out of control. While the procedure made the patients tranquil, it also robbed them of many or most of their mental faculties. They would never return to normalcy. Mr. Williams sister had endured such an operation and so, he knew of what he wrote. Kathleen Kennedy was also subjected to this procedure when she became uncontrollable. Nowadays, these behaviors are handled with Psychotropic Drugs. That's why this movie is set in 1936.

Mrs. Venable ofers to endow the crumbling Psychiatric Hospital at which Dr. Cucrowitz labors with a great deal of money if he will, in return, lobotomize Venable's young neice, Catherine Holly.

Cucrowitz, an honorable man with good intentions, refuses to agree to this arrangement until he knows more about Miss Holly and her traumatic experiences ""suddenly, last summer"".

Miss Holly (Taylor) has a problem. She no longer remembers what happened while she was traveling with cousin Sebastian. She is alone. Even her flighty mother (Mercedes Mccambridge) and greedy brother (Gary Raymond) refuse to take Cathy's part lest they alienate rich Aunt Violet. Her fate is now in Dr. Cucrowitz's hands.

Can Cathy save herself? Will anyone help her?

Joe Mankiewicz directs this gothic masterpiece with a sure and sensitive hand.

Great supporting performances come from Mercedes Mccambridge, Gary Raymond and Albert Decker.

This was an unhappy set. Taylor and Hepburn vied for supremacy, and as a testament to thier mutual talents, both actresses were nominated for Oscars.
Clift was still suffering from injuries sustained by an automobile accident. His addiction to Pain Relievers and Alcohol further complicated situations. Mankiewicz rode him hard to get a performance out of him, a state of affairs that angered both Hepburn and Taylor.

It has been said that when the shooting was finally over, Miss Hepburn spat in Mr. Mankiewicz face. Much to his credit, Mr. Mankiewicz always refused to comment on or even confirm the truth of this incident.

490197,4,6302655897,"Those not familiar with at least a tad bit of Tennessee Williams' real life woes may be disturbed by Suddenly, Last Summer if they take its plot literally. But those who know some of the playwright's background will be able to appreciate the symbolism captured in this movie based on the work Williams originally wrote as a one act play. It should also be noted that though Williams is given credit for writing the film with Gore Vidal, he was not happy with it and denounced it. It is indeed a metaphorically piece that probably translates better on stage. But classic movie lovers will still enjoy seeing Clift, Hepburn, and Taylor together in a maddening Southern Gothic black and white (thought the DVD cover is colorized) film from the 1950s.

SLS is the story of Catharine Holly (Taylor), driven mad by the mysterious death of her cousin Sebastian while they were vacationing in Europe together. Her Aunt Violet (Hepburn) persuades neurosurgeon Dr. Cuckrowicz (Clift) to move Hepburn to his asylum to examine her, enticing him with financial backing in hopes of getting the doctor to perform a lobotomy on Catharine in order to conceal the truth about Sebastian. That truth is that he was a homosexual, but being the 1950s, The Hollywood Production Code made the film makers cut out all references to it. True, that leaves a bit of the plot line left up to interpretation, but also provides a wonderful mystery element to the film because everyone avoids ""the truth"" about Sebastian and his demise. But a truth serum given to Catharine reveals all in the end!

Hepburn is brilliant as always, much deserving of the elevator-like throne she comes down out of the ceiling on in the movie. She's a classic eccentric here, giving the movie awesome nuances and she herself goes a bit mad in the end. The opening scene between her and Clift is the best! Young Taylor, mad throughout almost all of the film, is great too but still a bit too pretty most of the time. And Clift is a bit stiff, the irony being that he was hiding his own homosexuality.  Rumor has it that the directors treated him poorly and that Hepburn and Taylor both stood up for him. Still, all three shine in this classic film that fans, classic movie buffs, or Williams followers will certainly enjoy in one way or another.",1331337600,,2293,4.699004975124378
490198,3,6302655897,"Caution, this review contains spoilers!  According to Wikipedia, this film was a hit at the box office, but in subsequent years author Tennessee Williams, screenwriter Gore Vidal, and director Joseph Mankiewicz all distanced themselves from it.  I can see why.

 Good
 - nice performances by Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift
 - Katharine Hepburn is less annoying than usual
 - lovely shots of Liz's fabulous bosom and eyebrows
 - interesting topics, especially for 1959:  psychiatry, lobotomy, pederasty, oppressive family dynamics
 - kept my interest until the end

Bad
 - plot flaw #1: a gay man uses hot females to lure hetero males that the gay man will then hit on?
 - plot flaw #2: a pederaster pays male youths for sex, then they chase him and eat him alive?

Summary
Good acting, interesting topics in a Tennessee Williams fever dream that falls apart with a totally unrealistic denouement.  The ending would be fine if it were portrayed as a dream, but we're told it's literally what happened, and the characters uncritically accept it as such.

490201,5,6302655897,"SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER was one of those 60's films that seemed to represent the era. 3 A List actors, a great director and a script based on the Tennessee Williams' play. Other reviewers have basically given the entire plot away, so I want to focus a little on the dark vision Williams's was depicting in his play.

It could be something right out of a modern Gnostic gospel. Creation is carnivorous, one species preying on another, it's all eat or be eaten. Devour life before it devours you. A frightening canopy where even the act of birth is seen as something hideous & cruel. Was this how William's really felt? Was he a closet Gnostic? We may never fully know, but this movie does convey an inescapable suggestion: Perhaps it would have been better had there been no Creation at all.

But then we wouldn't have the movie",1305936000,3,824,4.5608108108108105
490202,4,6302655897,"The subject matter of this film, adapted from an intense one-act play by Tennessee Williams, will certainly not appeal to everybody. But mature viewers should be absorbed and fascinated by this Gothic psychodrama. In order to understand the plot, it helps to know a few sad, key elements from Williams' past. Williams' parents did not know what to do with his beloved sister Rose. In 1942, with Williams away, Rose was given a lobotomy. Williams never forgave his parents, or himself, for this. With ""Summer"", Williams seems to be getting some measure of twisted revenge, while wrestling with some of his own inner demons as well.
  Katharine Hepburn plays brillantly against type as the vengeful Violet Venable. Violet's son Sebastian died suddenly last summer while on a European holiday with her niece Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor). Violet wants Dr. Cukrowitz (Montgomery Clift) to give Catherine a lobotomy so she will stop her ""obscene babbling"" regarding the real truth of Sebastian's death.  There is some marvelous forshadowing by Williams during a pivitol monologue near the beginning of the film, delivered by Violet in Sebastian's spooky, primeval garden of devouring plants.
  To add to Catherine's troubles, her annoying mother and greedy brother (Mercades McCambridge and Gary Raymond) seems all too anxious to have Catherine comitted to Lion's View Asylum to have the devastating operation. Fortunately, the good Doctor is not about to do anything until he solves the puzzle of what really happened suddenly last summer.
  Hepburn and Taylor give two outstanding, tour-de-force performances. Both were nominated for the Academy Award as Best Actress. Being nominated in the same category, they both, in effect, cancelled each other out; according to the strange  rules and ways of the Academy Awards. Caught in the middle of the dramatic fireworks, Montgomery Clift is often unfairly criticised for giving a placid performance in comparsion to Hepburn and Taylor. Clift's role is largely reactionary, and he smartly underplays it. Smart, because someone has to (literally) be the voice of calm and reason here.
  Williams' plays always baffled and battled with the film censors. The brilliant cast of Viven Leigh, Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden fought hard to maintain the integrity of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) on screen. Although toned-down, ""Streetcar"" still makes a magnificent movie. By contrast, ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" is so whitewashed (the central homosexuality is missing), the 1958 movie is ridiculous nonsense. By late 1959, perhaps the times were changing. Or maybe everybody involved with ""Summer"", especially director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""All About Eve"") and writer Gore Vidal just didn't give a damn and ripped the envelope wide open. Vidal does a masterful job of adapting Williams' play, opening it up just enough for movies without diluting or destroying its disturbing content.  Thus, ""Summer"" arrived on screen with its shock value intact. The final twenty minutes belong to Elizabeth Taylor, who delivers an explosive monologue in which the truth is finally revealed.  The truth will have different meanings, depending on your own, individual moral code and value system.  Catherine's revelations save her life and send Violet over the edge  into a final grand delusion. Perhaps ""Summer"" is lurid and overheated, after all. But Tennessee Williams makes even the most lurid subject matter strangely surreal and beautifully poetic.",1302134400,8,3493,5.350364963503649

490243,3,6302655897,"I knew this movie was a Tennessee Williams play, but had not idea what the play was about. I think the story builds rather well, the climax interesting and the ending typical of 50s hollywood. Unlike others i didn't think that was strange - i have watched 'Sweet Bird of Youth' and 'Cat on a hot tin roof' both adaptations of Williams' plays and i felt both were very watchable but had cliched endings too. I am unable to say if that is the playwright or hollywood doing that, probably the latter. The 'cannibalism' and its description of hungry kids was totally racist to me, in no country anywhere do kids kill other people like that, and poverty deserves more compassion that what is shown, but again, not unusual for a movie of that time. I wonder what the author's original description was?
It is funny many people say the character of Sebastian was an oppressed homosexual. I felt it was Oedipus complex - strongly on the lines of Anthony Perkins relationship to 'mother' in psycho. If ther is anyone the movie is worth watching for it is Kath Hepburn, other performances including Taylors appear cliched and passable.",1272067200,3,1124,4.681818181818182
490244,5,6302655897,"This movie is a unique opportunity to see Katherine Hepburn in one of her best performances as Mrs. Violet Venable, a hypocritical, tyrannical and snobbish power monger of the old South. She is considering doing a lobotomy on her niece, Catherine Holly for fear that she could reveal the 'scandalous' life that led to her son Sebastian's savage death. As in many ways the mainstream culture in America would rather be lobotomized than accept the nature of homosexuality, this movie is a strange allegory for much more than a Southern Gothic scenario of horror and madness.
The most interesting things about this movie are outside the range of the camera: The great character of Sebastian, which sounds fascinating from the descriptions, and  how Montgomery Clift, himself a tortured homosexual, felt about playing the role of  the conscience in this movie that deals with his situation in the oblique manner that was only possible then to escape censorship. I find it fascinating that even today very few in the 75 reviews here even mention that homosexuality is a component in this film,not only because Sebastian is the central character to the story but because his mother and cousin can not be fully understood outside of the context of gay culture. Everything about the movie reverts to this theme: the exotic garden, once tended by Sebastian and now maintained by his mother,  the baroque elaboration of Mrs. Venable's language and her exquisite manners, the perfect beauty of the crazed cousin in her 'Parisian' dress, the elaborate gilt bronze elevator in the house shared by Sebastian and his mother that is a reference to the Byzantine throne: all of these details are classic components within the structure of gay culture and identity.
Elizabeth Taylor is compelling as the maddened Catherine. Montgomery Clift's performance is not one of his best, and though he still looks handsome the face definetly shows the signs of the extensive repair after the accident and the more extensive, permanent damage from drinking and drugging that would kill him.",1265673600,10,2062,5.07669616519174
490245,5,6302655897,"way back when, in school, one of my professors proclaimed this Williams's best play. i agree with him wholeheartedly (with ""Streetcar"" up there, with its very similar theme/themes, ie. human frailties and those who prey on their fellow human creatures).
its over-the-top gothic horror and mix of Catholic and pagan imagery is near-breathtaking. and it's worth noting that a life-size model/statue of St. Sebastian, the ""beautiful boy martyr,"" is prominently displayed in its main character's studio/study/abatoir. Sebastian Veneble, though we only see him in memory flashbacks, is the main character of this film: without him, there would be no ""Suddenly, Last Summer.""
i sincerely want to avoid offending anyone, Catholic or otherwise, but this movie plays like a Catholic Mass conceived and written by H. P. Lovecraft (and it must be Lovecraft: his florid, even at times epicene, Victorian style is mandatory). it's Transubstantiation/Eucharist/Communion with a horrifying twist. to my knowledge there has been no opera written based on the play, though it strikes me as being near-perfect for an intense one-act opera.

I couldn't have been more wrong. People are only attracted to this movie because they find it is different (obviously) and therefore feel they should embrace it because of its controversiality.

490249,4,6302655897,"I've recently become a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor.  It all happened while I was investing my time into Paul Newman's filmography.  Once I saw her steal scene after scene in `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' I knew that I had to know this woman more intimately.  So next I watched her 1963 epic `Cleopatra' (review to come, I promise) and I knew that this woman was special.  So I jumped at this one, since it was adapted from a Tennessee Williams play (and I had just rewatched `A Streetcar Named Desire', and had adored the aforementioned `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof', so you do the math).

`Suddenly Last Summer' is a very unique, very disturbing look at the lengths we will go to in order to protect the ones we love.  Shame and rage calculate into this deeply revolutionary tale of a woman desperate to protect her sons honor following his mysterious death.

The film opens with famed Dr. Cukowicz being summoned to the home of Mrs. Violet Venable; an older distinguished woman who is prepared to ask a very odd request of the young doctor.  Violet has recently lost her son Sebastian and the only witness to his death was his cousin Catherine.  What she witnessed was so extreme and frightening that she has gone insane.  Violet wishes to have this girl lobotomized, supposedly to end her pain but it is apparent that Violet's reasons are much more complicated than that.  The Dr. is hesitant, especially after he meets Catherine and realizes that there is more to this story than meets the eye.

The film really boils down to its shocking and tragic finale, which is delivered with violent fervor by Elizabeth Taylor as she recounts the truth behind Sebastian's death.  Without this vital piece of information the film may have fallen apart, and what's so nice about this conclusion and the way that it is handled is that it is ambiguous enough to almost remain a mystery.  Due to censorship back in the early years of cinema certain subjects were untouchable to-to-speak and so the real reasons behind Sebastian's death are somewhat guarded; but the way that Vidal adapted Williams' play and the way that Mankiewicz directs the flashbacks helps paint the true story for those willing to read between the lines.  It's expertly done; thinly veiled and completely effective.

In a word; shocking.

Both Elizabeth Taylor and Katherine Hepburn received Oscar nominations for their performances here, and both of them are very effective.  When portraying a character that was written for the stage on the screen an actor can fall easily into overacting, but at times that overacting becomes almost neccisary in order to really portray that character correctly.  Elizabeth Taylor is always endearing and intriguing, and her ending monologue is ferocious to say the least, but I must say that I found myself constantly drawn to Katherine Hepburn, and that is not something I expected.  I've always found this particular Hepburn to be vastly overrated, but here she is beyond stunning.  She has the villionas role of the overprotective mother down to a T and she crisply and sublimely allows herself to filter through the very real and very sharp emotions of this woman.  Even during Taylor's staggering recounting of the tragedy that befell Sebastian I found myself glued to Hepburn's every facial glitch.

She was mesmerizing.

I must say that I was a little put-off by the supporting cast, and even by Montgomery Clift.  He just seemed very out of it throughout the film.  Mercedes McCambridge and Gary Raymond came off like clichd caricatures, but it's not enough to really gripe about.  Had Clift at the very least performed a richer performance than this could have been a brilliant, A+ film.  Instead it gets knocked down a peg, resting at an easy B+.  The real heat here comes from the blisteringly realized script and the dueling of two very accomplished and very courageous actresses who buried deep into these roles ands into themselves to deliver something that will render us speechless.",1235347200,2,3985,4.827687776141384
490250,4,6302655897,"The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the review

Perhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights.  Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).

That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.

""Suddenly Last Summer is an odd little beauty of a play. Odd in that the appetites of the main (unseen in the play) character Sebastian seem to be both beyond the pale and obsessive. Odd, also that his protective monster of a mother is determined to keep the truth about her ""genius"" son from the world even after his `untimely' death ......last summer. As if to add fuel to the fire of an already bizarre tale of exploitation, sexual and otherwise, Sebastian's beautiful lure of a cousin used as bait for Sebastian's appetites is to be permanently taken out of the picture in order to keep this world 'beautiful'. Nobody wants to believes the sordid tale she has to tell about dear cousin Sebastian. The play ends with the `hope' that there may actually be someone to believe the girl's story before she becomes one more sacrifice to `beauty' in the world.

In the movie version, the stories that have to be told verbally in the play get told as flashbacks as well. Katherine Hepburn is in high dudgeon as Sebastian's mother and `keeper of the flame'. Montgomery Clift is a more sober, somber and searcher for the truth psychiatrist than the one in the play and Elizabeth Taylor is the beautiful lure cousin is a mass of confusions whose memories of last summer have to be erased ....some way. Old Sebastian and his twisted sense of life and his place in history is still a guy who had it coming to him. Well, he did, didn't he?",1231113600,,3158,4.840740740740741

Okay that's fine but I don't remember Spain having historical ""temples"" either. They have very old churches and cathedrals which are catholic. I was impressed how Elizabeth and Katherine pronounced Cabeza like a Spaniard as in ""Cabetha."" And I thought to myself, ""way to go ladies with your ""Castilian accent!""

I thought all performances were quite good. Some people harp on Montgomery Clift for not doing so well, accusing him of being like ""cardboard."" But that's how a lot of doctors generally are, in real life so many lack emotion. In contrast I thought he was a doctor who truly ""cared.""
Without giving away much of what ""Suddenly, Last Summer"" focuses on I would like to recommend ""The Children's Hour"" with Shirley Maclain and Audrey Hepburn. The story has a similar scandal dealing with the same topic and is so very well done. It's a gorgeous black and white film as well and all the performances are mesmerizing.

490295,5,6302655897,"If there was something interesting to remark about this bold and brave decade of the Fities was the fact many overlooked issues were exposed for the posterity. This film is part of the sextet of demolishing movies (The man of the golden arm, Baby Doll Butterfly 8, A long and hot summer and Anatomy of a murder).

""Suddenly last summer"" was an audacious step in those times in which certain aspects of the intimate life had to be enclosed.

But the brilliant intelligence of the author, made of this existential dramatis personae, a distant consequence and not the primary plot, and he focused around the position of domination of a very wealthy Southern matriarch, her supposedly mad niece and a neurosurgeon.

The dialogues are pieces of the play. They reveal, suggest and mask the used conventionalisms, the well exposed moral codes, the well known device of transfer of blame. However the neurosurgeon is aware there is something nasty beneath the speech and decides to find out much more the words may describe.

Tennessee Williams was a sharp writer, and like a prominent artist, you may not conform yourself with a lineal approach. Obviously, the author proposes us the words may even disfigure not only a human life, but the most important (thinking at a major level) the relevance of the speech as lethal weapon in order to destroy the reputation of any human being (the black list of the previous decade, perhaps?).

At the dramatic resolution, we are aware what really happened and whosoever was out of the real context in this world, when our venerable matriarch's projects, and the embodiment of her elusive fantasies on the own neurosurgeon in the last sequence, in which we may watch her as Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset boulevard"", a lonely and disassociated woman trapped in her vanished dreams.

490297,5,6302655897,"Suddenly, Last Summer is an excellent film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play of the same name. The cast couldn't be better: Katherine Hepburn, Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor star in this horrifying drama. Although two hours long, you'll never stir once in your seat. The excellent dialogue holds your attention and the convincing acting is nothing short of stellar.

When the film begins, a wealthy middle aged widow named Violet Venable (Katherine Hepburn) still suffers the pain from the loss of her son Sebastian the previous summer. Although Violet wants to remember her son as a ""chaste"" man, her niece Cathy Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) unconsciously remembers the actual events that led to Sebastian's tragic and untimely death. Violet can't stand the fact that Cathy remembers just a bit too much about Sebastian, so she tries to bribe a doctor (Montgomery Clift) to lobotomize Catherine so that her son's memory will never be defiled.

It's a race against time as Dr. Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift) becomes intrigued by Catherine's story and unusual memory loss. The doctor is under intense pressure to lobotomize Cathy from both Violet Venable and his boss at the asylum where Catherine is being kept. However, Dr. Cukrowicz wants to see if Catherine can be made to tell the truth--and avoid a lobotomy at the last minute.

The plot moves along very well and certain images could scare sensitive people. Sebastian's garden is an eerie place that reflects superlative set design; and the split screen at the end when Cathy finally does remember exactly how Sebastian died will stay in your head for quite a while after you view this film.

The DVD contains few real extras; we do get the theatrical trailer for the film and you can select scenes to view and setup the audio as you wish from several options.

Suddenly, Last Summer is one of those rare films that are truly memorable well after you've seen them. Although you can't be squeamish in order to handle the ending of this film, I believe this is one of the best films ever made. When you watch this film you will be riveted by the action and plot development just as I was.

I highly recommend this film for film buffs and for people who want to see Katherine Hepburn perform a tour de force as a ghastly villain. People who enjoy films with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift will also appreciate this movie.",1194134400,24,2387,4.8525798525798525

490299,5,6302655897,"SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER is one of the strongest Tennessee Williams film adaptations, and that is due in no small part to Gore Vidal's fiery screenplay and the first-rate main players of Taylor, Hepburn and Clift.

The story opens in 1937.  Eccentric and wealthy Southern widow Mrs Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn) enlists the services of prolific mental health surgeon Dr. Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift).  Cukrowicz specialises in performing the revolutionary frontal lobotomy procedure on those patients whose entire lives are consumed by their illnesses.

Mrs Venable introduces Cukrowicz to her troubled young niece, Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor).  Ever since Catherine accompanied Violet's dead son Sebastian on his last trip to Europe, Catherine has been plagued by fearful fits of insanity.  In return for some important funding for his surgery, Mrs Venable wants Catherine to be the next patient for Cukrowicz.

But what exactly happened to Sebastian on that fateful final trip...and why does Mrs Venable desperately want Catherine to forget it...?

Here in SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, a horrifying journey into sweat-stained asylums and heavily-veiled secrets,  Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn deliver tour-de-force performances.  A lot of people still find Montgomery Clift somewhat lacking here, but a lot of that does come back to the character he plays, who is very much overshadowed by the two women.  There is also some fine work from Mercedes McCambridge as Catherine's weak-willed mother.

Taylor was nominated for an Academy Award (in addition to Hepburn), but failed to win, partly because this was during the period when her tumultuous private life essentially got her blackballed; though she did manage to grab the Golden Globe for her performance--in direct competition with Hepburn.

SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER remains a searing and shocking movie experience.  If you have never seen it, do yourself a favour and buy it today.  You'll be riveted from beginning to end.

Elizabeth Taylor is sensational, playing Catherine, the girl who may have lost her mind after having witnessed her cousin's bizarre death that occurred ""suddenly, last summer"" during the vacation. Katherine Hepburn is magnificent as his adoring mother who wants the disturbing memories been surgically removed from the girl's memory.

Her homosexual cousin used her as a procuress; her vindictive aunt demands that she be given a lobotomy: Liz is again the unappreciated beauty... But she's also the abandoned innocent, a girl fighting to remember what happened to her cousin Sebastian Venable died suddenly, in North Africa, during the summer...

Taylor's performance is like a melody, rising toward the end to an emotional crescendo of desperation and release... And Taylor handles it expertly; she is ironical, self-deprecating, and self-aware...For all that Catherine Holly starts out as a neurotic kid in the woods, she ends the film as a courageously woman set free by her confession...

The film belongs to the women; even McCambridge, in her relatively small role, has a showier part than Clift's... Clift is thoughtful, considering, and considerate... Hepburn's performance is quite restrained... Feeding insects to a carnivorous plant in a gesture that is a metaphor for the incestuous nature of the relationship with her son, Hepburn is all cool rationally and sweet reason... Violet Venable is an expert at getting her own way and Hepburn makes her most outrageous actions seem those of a moderate and kind-hearted woman...",1168732800,12,1423,5.232456140350878

490335,4,6302655897,"It's hard to take your eyes off an impossibly beautiful, 27-year old Elizabeth Taylor, especially in her skintight white bathing suit, and the fact that she gives a powerhouse performance, likely her best prior to ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", is reason enough to watch this 1959 Gothic melodrama from the fulsome pen of Tennessee Williams. She plays Catherine Holly, a mentally unstable young woman traumatized by a violent incident which ended with her cousin Sebastian's death last summer in a Mexican beach resort.

Trapped in a mental hospital that recalls the bowels of the asylum presented in ""The Snake Pit"" ten years earlier, she cannot remember what happened and is constantly drugged but manages to exhibit enough credibility to make Dr. Cukrowicz assess that she may not be disturbed enough to warrant a lobotomy. The procedure is being pushed by the late Sebastian's grande dame mother, Violet Venable, who wants to silence Catherine lest she reveal the shocking secrets of Sebastian's life and death. A doyenne of New Orleans society, Mrs. Venable dangles a tempting carrot of a $1 million donation to Cukrowicz's hospital for brain research if the lobotomy is done.

As was common under the production code in the 1950's and similar to what was done to dilute Williams' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", the film only alludes to Sebastian's homosexuality, using rather graphic symbolism to bring across the dramatic tension of the situation. In this case, it works because it's consistent with the Baroque style of the entire movie. Taylor goes toe-to-toe with the formidable Katharine Hepburn playing against type as Mrs. Venable, a cold and manipulative character whose flamboyant hypocrisy hides her own unsteady state. Each actress gets a showy monologue with Catherine's climactic description of that infamous summer the true capper of the story.

Saddled with the purely observational role of Cukrowicz, Montgomery Clift seems rather passive as he has to explain the more convoluted plot points in a becalmed manner. Co-adapted for the screen by Gore Vidal and Williams, the film is dialogue-heavy as most of Williams' works are, and director Joseph Mankiewicz (""All About Eve"", ""A Letter to Three Wives"") is a master at this type of character interplay. Jack Hildyard's crisp black-and-white cinematography works well for this story as color would have emphasized the melodramatic excesses (note how pale Taylor's violent eyes look).

490338,4,6302655897,"""Suddenly Last Summer"" (1959) is a strange, dark movie, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and based on a play written by Tennessee Williams. This film touches many subjects that where highly controversial at the time it was made, for example mental illness, homosexuality and cannibalism. Truth to be told, a lot is to be inferred, and not much is shown. However, the fact that the characters hardly ever mention things that so obviously have to do with what happens makes those themes stand out even more.

The central question in this movie is, of course, ""what happened last summer?"", and the spectator will be immediately drawn into the mystery. Unfortunately for us, the only witness to what happened is Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor), a beautiful and traumatized young woman who became mentally unbalanced after witnessing the death of her cousin Sebastian Venable. Her aunt, wealthy Mrs. Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn), thinks that Catherine should be lobotomized. That is the reason why she urges neurosurgeon Dr. John Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift) to perform the operation. However, Dr. Cukrowicz believes that his patient may not be mad, after all, and that Mrs. Violet Venable might want the lobotomy in order to destroy Catherine?s mind. But what does Cathy know? What happened last summer?

On the whole, I think that you will like this movie, if you don?t mind the somber tone that pervades it. Recommended!

This film has it all: incest, homosexuality, mental illness, and cannibalism.  You don't have to read to deeply into the film to see these elements.  Too bad the film doesn't resonate more.  Despite all of these sensational elements that are indeed provocative they don't add up to much.  I was also offended by the way the film exploits the mentally handicapped.  What redeems this film are the fantastic lead performances.  Katharine Hepburn, looking like the inspiration of Cruella DeVille, effectively chews the scenery as the heiress who has a creepy relationship with her late son and wants to lobotomize her niece who witnessed the son's death.  Elizabeth Taylor, at the peak of her beauty, effectively goes toe-to-toe with Hepburn as the niece who may or may not be insane.  Taylor doesn't overplay the mental illness angle and capures the right tone for the traumatized character.

490340,4,6302655897,"I finally in 2005 see this movie released in 1959. I'm not sure what to say. The good: Elizabeth Taylor. Although she has taken a lot of criticism over the years for some of the bad movies she has made, she does a fantastic job of acting here. She even looks less than 100% beautiful when she is first seen in a hospital gown, and that takes some doing by the makeup department. It's always good to see that she sometimes is a fine actor. The not as good: Katharine Hepburn is of course one of our finest actors, but this is not her best role. You can see the beginnings here of the over-the-top performances that she often gave in later years. Montgomery Clift as Dr. Cukrowicz is wooden and just does a lot of staring. Finally, the ""what is going on"" here? Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams co-wrote the screenplay from a Williams play so they get most of the credit or blame, depending on your point of view. Of course the writers had to get around the censors-- Vidal had suffered greatly for his honest writing in THE CITY AND THE PILLAR-- so we have all this secrecy about Hepburn's (Mrs. Venable) son Sebastian who died ""suddenly last summer,"" the cause of his death and the effect of his death on Catherine (Ms. Taylor). There seems to be a bit of incest-- emotional if not physical-- a hint that Sebastian may have had a thing about young men (""we procured for him""), and the ending that pretty much defies description. While I cannot conceive that Williams was striving for camp, since his own sister had one of the first lobotomies in the country-- Ms. Venable, along with the consent of Catherine's mother, wants that surgery performed on Catherine-- nevertheless, much of this movie comes across as less than serious, to say the least.

Query: Would we have seen so much of Ms. Taylor in that white bathing suit in the famous beach scene that supposedly took place in 1937 or 37? And would a physician have received no reprimand for kissing a patient the way Clift sucks face with Ms. Taylor?

Of course no American playwright has produced more fragile women characters than Tennessee Williams. We can add two more to the list; but for me, they do not work as well as some of the others, Blanche and Maggie, for instance.

Less than perfect Williams, however, is still entertaining.",1130025600,2,2295,4.552058111380146
490341,5,6302655897,"""Suddenly, Last Summer"" is one of my favorite films for many reasons.  The lush writing is Tennessee Williams at his best.  The Screenplay is far superior to his original work, which was a short stage play. Due the bizarre subject matter of the story and because it was the late 1950's, much of the plot was considered taboo by the film censors. William had to then mask and conceal much of the questionable and unpleasant subject matter in a way that would insure getting the film approved.  For example instead of using the word rape, Williams had to describe a character as ""loosing her honor"".  Gore Vidal helped Williams adapt his work for the film and these great writers produced a script that is both poetic and dripping with lurid prose.  Because of this the film takes on a surreal and dreamlike state that is heightened further by the glorious black and white photography.  I don't think this film would have been nearly as effective in color!

The basic plot, without giving away too much, concerns a New Orleans Brain Surgeon (Montgomery Cliff) who is asked by a wealthy widow (Katherine Hepburn) to perform a lobotomy on her demented Niece (Elizabeth Taylor).  Hepburn wants to erase from Taylor's mind a horrific memory of what happened the prior summer while Hepburn's beloved son was on vacation with Taylor.  Taylor witnessed his death on a tropical island.  There is much more to the story but half the fun of this creepy film is letting it unfold to its unbelievable climax.  I especially love the last twenty minutes which is shown in flashback. We get to see exactly what Elizabeth Taylor experienced that made her go crazy.  Both Taylor and Hepburn were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this film...and it shows!  Special mention goes to Taylor for allowing herself, in the first half of the film, to be photographed looking disheveled and a bit frumpy.  Later though we are treated to seeing her in all her glory as one of the most beautiful women ever put on film!

This movie isn't for everyone though.  You must love old black and white movies and invest some thought into just what Williams and Vidal were trying to say.  There are long deliciously written monologues that some may find boring.  To me it's a well acted gothic mystery that only gets better with repeated viewings.",1128643200,11,2322,4.733830845771144

Montgomery Clifts character was a bit dull but I don't think that was due to Montgomery. I believe the character was written as a rather book-wormish kind of guy, and Montgomery came across as that guy.

This is a drama in the traditional sense of a who-dun-it, but in this film, the ultimate question was ""what happened to Sebastian?""

Katherine Hepburn creates an unforgettable character as the wealthy, pampered, imperial mother (in full high camp-mode) who refuses to accept her precious son's  erotic addiction...and  the ultimate price he paid for it. A spectacularly comely Elizabeth Taylor, flashing eyes, wasp waisted and full bosomed, is perfect  as the younger woman who Sabastian traded in his mother for when she became much too old to attract (and therefore to bait) his brand of  'delicious""  thugboy-toys. He was no fool...he understood what bait needed to be. She had the  grave misfortune to have witnessed that horrific final attack which  brought Sabatian's  life of romantic, artistic  leisure (somewhere on a sunbaked ,exotic island) to a sudden, unthinkable end.

Violet, the mother, spends much of the movie trying to get a doctor to perform a lobotomy on miss Taylors' character in order to stop her  from ""babbling"" about  Sabastian's
preferred tastes in pleasures of the flesh....and his  shockingly violent end.
Montgomery cliff plays the  doctor who ends up refereeing  these two extremely watchable old-school drama queens . He's the least effective casting choice, much too weak and fey and
he seems more ""intrigued"" by Sabastian's ""adventures"" than appalled by them. It was hard NOT  to imagine the doctor as Sabastian..especially since Sabastian's face was never shown in flashbacks...a great directorial  choice.

490413,2,6302655897,"Montgomery Clift plays a young doctor who does lobotomies in the 1930's. He works at a state hospital which has no money.  Everyone calls him Dr. Sugar, but in the cast credit, his name is long, unpronounceable, and not even close to ""sugar"".  Anyway, another doctor in charge tells him that the very wealthy Violet Venable wants to see him.  In hopes of getting a large donation, he visits her to see what she wants.

This takes place in the South somewhere, not sure if they ever say where, but needless to say, Katharine Hepburn hasn't got, (nor did she try to have)a Southern accent. She speaks in her usual, impossible to understand, uppercrust Yankee accent. She takes Dr. Sugar out on her patio, with lots of fake jungle plants and a skeleton angel statue, and tells him a long, very long story about traveling with her precious son Sebastian to see the Galapagos Islands.  The story seems to take forever, actually it takes her about ten minutes to spit out the whole thing: about baby sea turtles hatching and huge flesh-eating birds attacking them.  She couldn't watch, but son Sebastian did, and later told her that he saw God.

While telling her stories, Violet uses the word ""suddenly"" about SIX times. Well, the gist of the matter is, Sebastian died last summer, and his cousin Cathy saw it happen, went ""crazy"" and is now locked up with some nuns taking care of her.  Violet tells Dr. Sugar that Cathy is telling horrible, obscene stories about her precious Sebastian and how he actually died (Violet said he had a heart attack), and she wants to put a stop to this slander by giving Cathy a lobotomy.

So Dr. Sugar goes to visit Cathy (Elizabeth Taylor, who forgets she's supposed to have a Southern accent, remembers and overdoes it, then completely forgets again).  He asks her the first thing she can remember, which she says is ""last spring"". Although she does remember her uncle dying when Sebastian was trying to be a monk, and his mother was trying to get him to come home.  When her husband died, Violet wouldn't come home for the funeral. And since Sebastian died in the summer, that had to have happened prior to the spring that she says is her first memory. In any case, in the spring, she was at a party with Sebastian, wanted to leave, couldn't locate her coat, and a strange man offered her a ride home.  Very delicately without coming out and saying it, she makes Dr. Sugar think she was raped by this man. Was she? Who knows.

When Cathy starts to talk about her summer trip to Cabeza de Lobo with Sebastian, she suddenly starts sceaming, ""I can't remember! I can't remember! I can't remember!"" Then how come old Vi heard that Cathy was telling everybody she did remember every disgusting detail?.  Why does Vi need to shut her up if she can't remember?  Cathy has no idea that a lobotomy is on order for her thanks to Aunt Vi. So why would Cathy not tell this doctor what she's been telling everyone else who will listen?

Even Cathy's own mother, (Mercedes McCambridge, who uses her southern accent studiously throughout), wants her to have the lobotomy, because if she does, Vi will give her and Cathy's brother $100,000. Nice family.

In the end Dr. Sugar brings Cathy (who keeps kissing him) to Vi's fake jungle patio, to tell the whole, nonsensical story of what happened to the wonderful Sebastian. This takes quite some time, with lots of the same words repeated over and over(reminscent of the baby sea turtle story), and is the part where I kept dozing off.  I gather that a bunch of kids cut Sebastian up with their tin musical instruments, but for what reason or if really happened, wasn't clear. You would think there would be some kind of police report, and the undertaker would know, etc. But the state doctor (in attendance for this major event) announces ""The girl's story could very well be true."" Sure, he was all ready to give her a lobotomy thirty minutes earlier.

Shocking, I suppose, if you like to be shocked by vague, unexplained stories, but I'm not buying it.  The script was ridiculous, the acting was very unconvincing.",1115942400,6,4081,4.626038781163435

Marilyn Monroe sadly observed that during the filming of The Misfits, that Montgomery Clift was the only person in the business who was more shaky than she was...

Taylor and Hepburn are letter-perfect, but their performances cannot be regarded as a success because of their overplaying; Their strain show in handling embaressing lines ""necassary"" because of the censorship at the time it was shot.

Cathy Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) is a traumatized girl whom everyone has a stake in shutting up--everyone, that is, except the doctor slated to perform an obviously inappropriate lobotomy upon her (Monty Clift).  Elizabeth Taylor delivers a strong if sometimes overwrought performance as Cathy.  Katherine Hepburn gives a textured performance as the eponymously named Mrs. Venable, Cathy's venerable, manipulative, and delusional aunt.  Mercedes McCambridge is appropriately annoying as Cathy's ignoramus of a mother.  Clift can't quite overcome the inherent limitations of his character, whose main purpose seems to be to serve as a foil for the others.

The poetic style of Williams' original play is preserved in the lines of Mrs. Venable, which makes Hepburn's scenes especially fun: Mrs. Venable could almost be an aging Blanche Dubois.  This alone makes the film worth checking out.",1104624000,,994,5.5

Elizabeth Taylor is passible, but the other actors are wretched: either ludicrously over the top (Katherine Hepburn and Mercedes McCambridge) or ludicrously under it. The latter category belongs to post-car accident Montgomery Clift who wanders through the film looking shell shocked; sadled with a hopeless part, surrounded by actors rentlessly chewing the scenary, he seems stupified. (Everyone but Taylor's character appears to be in need of a lobotomy -- except  Clift who appears to have already had one.) Besides this, we also have Joseph Mankiewicz's typically workmanlike directing -- he adds not a bit of nuance or style to the proceedings.
If the movie is fascinating to watch, nevertheless,  it is because the general hysteria (the performances, the plot, the dialogue) somehow seems a consequence of the film's inability to speak directly about its homosexual subject matter.

490460,5,6302655897,"Tennessee Williams SOUTHERN GOTH masterpiece a la dark black and white Hollywood film style with Joseph (All About Eve, Guys & Dolls) Mankiewicz at the director's helm and screenplay adapted by Gore Vidal.

Elizabeth Taylor plays beautiful and crazy Cathy and Mercedes McCambridge (the actress who provided the voice of the demon in The Exorcist) plays her protective mother. Katherine Hepburn is Auntie Venable and wants niece Cathy to have a lobotomy to help her forget what she witnessed in regards to her son and Cathy's cousin, Sebastian and his untimely & somewhat mysterious ""death"" involving Sebastian's sexual secrets...

This all happened in front of Cathy's young & virginal eyes, ""Suddenly, Last Summer"". Last summer, Cathy and Sebastian travelled to Europe on an extravagant, decadent & obviously quite hedonistic vacation. Mrs. Venable was already quite traumatized by a baby sea turtle massacre last summer on the Galapogos Islands and Kathy was raped that very summer but what happened to cousin Sebastian in Europe was something that completely broke Kathy's fragile mind.

Auntie Venable gets the help of Dr. Cukrowicz, played by Montgomery Clift to see if he can help poor Cathy out with a prescibed lobotomy and mainly to save the selfish & overbearing Mrs. Venable from having people know about her son's secrets that got him killed.

From the opening scene, the viewer is riveted to the screen and left wondering... wondering... WHAT really happened so suddenly, last summer?  The film builds and builds into the last 20 minutes of this film where Taylor gives a tremendous soliliquy  and overview of just what DID happen to poor Sebastian.  The split-screen effect that is used in this ending scene is fabulous.  You never see Sebastian so what you are conjuring up in your mind is MUCH MORE horrific than they could have filmed back then.  Wonderful cast with excellent performances from all but Clift who was quite medicated during the grueling shoot due to an accident before filming.

490461,3,6302655897,"""Suddenly Last Summer"" is a Southern gothic tale about a gaddabout dame (Elizabeth Taylor) who saw something so frightening while on a vacation in Greece that it made her go nuts.  How do you solve a problem like Elizabeth?  Well that's easy - you cut half her brain out.  At least that's what Katharine Hepburn would like to do.  Montgomery Clift, as the sympathetic doctor, has other ideas however.  This is high camp and low melodrama but strangely enough it works - and brilliantly so.
TRANSFER: Columbia gives us an average transfer.  The grayscale is a bit off with too low a contrast level that registers most scenes in tonal gray instead of true black and white.  Age related artifacts are everywhere.  Ditto for a hint of compression related digital artifacts and some minor edge enhancement.  The audio is MONO but nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: NONE! If you've purchased more than two Columbia Classics you should be used to this skimy treatment by now!

490462,3,6302655897,"The question here is ""How do one view a movie that's approaching its 50th Birthday?"". All movies are products of their era but as times have changed so much it becomes increasingly difficult to identify with stories from the last decade, never mind the last generation.
The DVD blurb praises the way the movie treats ""the then taboo subjects of homosexuality, prostitution and cannibalism"" (although I'd suggest that cannibalism is still taboo...), although really none of these words is mentioned, and in fact, any specific mention of the terms is couched in euphemism and subterfuge that one almost wonders how an audience in 1959 (that isn't as savvy with homosexuality, prostitution and cannibalism as we are)  would even have understood what was going on.
So to view the movie in modern terms is quite unfair.  We're all familiar enough with Mental Health to condemn the idea of a lobotomy on a girl whose quite clearly suffering from some kind of repressed memory due to extreme trauma, we'd all happily call the mother out on her gay son's use of underage prostiutes, and the camera work and slow-moving dialogue heavy plots are intolerable to a young ADD audience brought up on Nintendo and car commericals.  So I'm afraid as a modern viewer it's hard to watch this movie for anything but historical interest. It hasn't aged well and it's ground-breaking subject matter is now commonplace.
Two thoughts stay with me in closing though.  Firstly the assumption in the movie that because Sebastian was homosexual, he was a pederast and had a voracious sexual appetite not only offends modern sensibilities, but also must've been difficult for  Montgomery Clift to deal with.
Secondly, Elizabeth Taylor is beautiful, voluptuous and sexy, yet she'd be considered far to chubby to star as a sex symbol in a modern Hollywood movie.

Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) begins with Montgomery Clift as a doctor who performs labotomies on people under primitive hospital conditions.  He believes in giving people the mental peace they need.  He makes a requested house call to an eccentric woman of means (Katharine Hepburn).  She has plenty of money and is in care of her deceased son's estate.  His home has a backyard full of unique trees and plants, including carnivorous.  The land looks like a tropical forest. Her niece (Elizabeth Taylor) is at St. Mary's, a custodial home for the insane.  She has fits of violence and babbling.  Sebastian, the deceased son, his death has been a mystery or rather the whole story has not been told.  Elizabeth Taylor knows but can't remember...yet.  She must now be sent elsewhere, the home can no longer take care of her.  So this aunt would like her niece to have a labotomy that the doctor performs.  I will not reveal anymore of the plot, but this film is a must-see.

Sound a little over the top?  Well, it is, but this is a Tennessee Williams story and over the top is what makes it fun.
Katherine Hepburn plays the dead man's very wealthy mother who decides that her niece must have a lobotomy in order to prevent her telling the truth about what happened last summer.  She approaches neurosurgeon Montgomery Clift with a big cheque to help convince him of its necessity.  Before he operates, he wants to delve into Taylor's case and the unravelling of the mystery of what happened that summer drives the film.
The first time I saw the film I remember being unimpressed by Taylor.  Not so the second time, however, as she delivers an emotionally charged performance with much skill.  She gets some big moments in the story, and she takes full advantage.  Hebpurn gets to play one of the strangest characters of her career, and does so with obvious relish and style.  Clift is very subdued in a thinly written role, letting the two star actresses take control of the scenes and reveal their characters, which is really what a psychiatrist does.
There is obviously more going on then the script of a 1950's film could get into, so the film deals with its larger issues as well as could be expected.  The last twenty minutes are especially impressive.  It's certainly not a feel good movie, dealing with some pretty dark aspects of human behaviour and reasoning.

Katharine Hepburn is memorable as the very weird Mrs. Violet Venable, a wealthy New Orleanian matron who keeps a monstrous jungle of carnivorous plants on her patio grounds. She attempts to procure the services of a new young neuro-surgeon (Montgomery Clift) with a radically new method of lobotomy to lobotomize her supposedly mad niece Catherine (a stunning Elizabeth Taylor) to shut-up her ramblings about the death of Violets' son, Sebastian, who died a grotesque death ""suddenly last summer"". Of course, Catherine isn't mad but still in shock since she witnessed Sebastians' death. While showing her ""garden"" to the doctor, Mrs. Venable relates a morbid story of she and Sebastian witnessing baby turtles being devoured by sea birds as they scrambled for their lives to the ocean. This tale is allegorical to the way Sebastian died but Mrs. Venable is in extreme denial about the nature of his death and the twos' true relationship. The doctor begins interviewing Catherine and discovers the truth through the use of truth serum. Sebastian was a sexual predator who used his mother while they vacationed to attract young men and when Violet was no longer young or pretty enough he turned to Catherine. This leads to the horrible revelations about his death that Violet Venable is determined to stop Catherine from revealing---even if it means a lobotomy. This is amazing subject matter for the time and daringly brought to the screen. The film is somewhat stagily done but fascinating to watch thanks to the awesome performances of Hepburn and Taylor.

This was a pairing of Cliff and Taylor (romatic interests off screen at the time) after the filming of RainTree Country.

Taylor is superb is one of her typically overrought performances, Helpbern perfect as the controlling, overly domanant, maybe incesteous mother of the dead Sebastion, willing to sacrifice the sanity of her neice in order to keep a shrine to her son's memory, Cliff shows the strain of the constant pain, but delivers a very credible performance as the doctor trying to decided just who is sane and who is not.

Adapted from a play by Tennessee Williams who was joined by Gore Vidal in writing the screenplay, it's a strikingly weird story set in 1937 New Orleans and deals with the sensitive subjects of insanity, lobotomy and cannibalism.
When we consider that the film was released during a time of high censorship, we have to applaud the writing, which had to conform to the guidelines of the time.  Perhaps for this reason though, some of the story is not quite crystal clear.  But this doesn't matter, nor does it matter that the Southern accents seem either non-authentic or missing altogether.  That's because of the strength of the performances.  And not every detail has to always be tied up in a neat package. If you're looking for a lightweight, comfortable film, you won't find it here.

A torrid melodrama with a weird hothouse atmosphere reeking of social and mental decay, the resulting film can only be described as ""southern gothic"" at its best.
William's powerful one act play suffers somewhat in its translation to the screen, largely because the compact one-act on which it was based was necessarily padded to fill out a full-length film. The film also has a very different conclusion which (although it works quite well in the film) lacks the sense of disquiet found in the play. I strongly disagree, however, with reviewers who feel censorship of the day got in the way of the story's point. The original play presented the story in the same oblique manner, and by requiring the viewer to piece the niece's story together the film draws the viewer into itself in a way that a flat statement of fact would prevent.
Montgomery Cliff, seen here toward the end of his career and life, is the weak link in the cast, but although his performance is not one of his better efforts it isn't actually bad and it doesn't detract from the film. Hepburn is clearly cast against type and at times seems a bit out of place as a New Orleans resident, but she plays her role with considerable effective ferocity. But the real star here is Elizabeth Taylor, who gives a remarkably arresting over-the-top performance. Extreme though it is, Taylor's performance conveys the horror of the nightmarish event that has prompted the character's persistent hysteria, and the long scene in which she relives the incident is remarkable for its power and intensity.
SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER caused a tremendous stink when it debuted and was condemned by virtually every serious film critic and moral watchdog group in the country as morbid, vulgar, and distasteful trash. And so it is--but that IS the nature of the story. Some viewers will find it excessive, some will find it unsavory, and some may point blank dislike everything about it, but the fact remains that it is extremely well done and amazingly memorable, and of all attempts to bring a Tennessee Williams script to the screen it is perhaps the most successful in terms of both atmosphere and raw power.",1009670400,8,2510,4.922169811320755

Based on the play by Tennessee Williams, it boasts a screenplay written by Williams and Gore Vidal, was directed by the ever-stylish Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"", ""All About Eve""), and features an incredible cast led by Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn.  Miss Taylor, looking every inch A Movie Star (her beauty is almost impossible to describe), gives a forcefully raw performance in the role of Catherine Holly, whose cousin Sebastian died under mysterious circumstances while the two of them were traveling abroad; while Miss Hepburn, every inch An Actress, is equally fascinating in the role of Sebastian's manipulative mother, Violet Venable.  These two actresses, each arguably the biggest star-icon of their generations, are introduced in long individual sequences, and when they finally confront one another, the thespic sparks really begin to ignite the screen!  Both received Best Actress Oscar nominations for their performances, and either would have been a worthy winner, but Simone Signoret got the trophy for ""Room at the Top"", possibly in part because Taylor and Hepburn split the votes.

490525,1,6302655897,"Once again Hollywood has managed to take the mind out of a brilliant piece of literature. Yes, they glamorized and turned it into something far from its original form. The play 'Suddenly Last Summer' by Tennesse Williams is a thought provoking and compassionate play. It is a social commentary, which also explores the nature of relationships. In essence it is about truth and hummanity. However the movies seems to neglect these two fundemental elements of the original story.
On the surface the story starts with Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) who is sent to an asylum by Sebastian's Mother, Mrs. Venerable (Katherine Hepburn) as a result her hideous explaination of Sebastian's death in Cabeza de Lobo. Mrs. Venerable calls on Dr. John Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift) to perform a labotermy on Catherine, to stop her from descrating Sebastian's name through her horrible explanation of his death.  Catherine is compelled to retell her experience in Cabeza de Lobo for her final audience -the doctor, Mrs. Vernerable, and her mother and brother. She faces the moral dilemma of whether to tell the true story, to her detriment, or to appease her mother and brother and create a less hideous story. However the truth is exposed and through this story the nature of Mrs. Venerable's relationship with her son (Sebastian) and his true character, as well as his death, are explored.
The movie, typical of Hollywood, distorts the play as it neglects to even portray the nature of society, and its social stratification between rich and poor, by altering the real reason for Sebastian's death. They change the the devouring of Sebastian as a result of desperate starvation of poverty-striken children, to a canabalistic ritual, of a deranged gang of kids, who want to revenge Sebastian for his homosexuality. Sebastian's homosexuality is relatively subtle in the play, whilst it is over-emphasized in the movie. Catherine a strong and genuine character, is turned into a weak and helpless female, who needs support from the doctor. And the inevitable...Because a Hollywood film would not be a proper film without a love story! Catherine after exposing the truth about Sebastian's death, miraculously is no longer traumatized, and walks away hand in hand with the doctor. A glossy finish may be pleasant to look at it, but it looses its truth.
'Suddenly Last Summer' is a deeply truthful play about the nature of society and relationships, however the movie sensationalizes both of these pivotal elements of the play.

490526,5,6302655897,"Tennessee Williams was fascinatd by the cruelty of Titus Anronicus by Shakespeare, and in this film he connects two themes of his. First the exploration of the depth that any surface hides. The surface is shining and beautiful. A mother loves her son ... so much that she stifles him. She is from an extremely rich family and can turn the son into some private toy. He plays the game and at the same time introduces her to the ugliness and barbarity of the world, of the natural world of course, but also of the human world. And here is the second theme of the film. The son uses his mother as a procurer in his voyages in Europe or elsewhere to satisfy his sexual drives. But age takes its toll and the mother comes to the point where she fails in her procuring. So, the son, with the probable assent of his mother, decides to take his cousin along one summer. The latter discovers what her cousin really is and she is unable to cope. The son will be  devoured  by hungry children. A symbolical way of telling the truth. But the worst part is that the mother tries to have the girl lobotomised in order to make her stop telling what happened. The doctor will have to disentangle the truth from the ranting and raving of the deranged girl and of the selfish mother. The end becomes a completely turn around of the situation. The real depth of the drama appears then. Tennessee Williams's world is definitely a world of false and fake appearances so brittle that a gust of social wind can destroy them. The film is purely brilliant and the two actresses are able to make us fear and desire an end that we see coming up and looming over our heads, though we really would not like to know about it.

Superb acting by imperious  Katherine Hepburn and very beautiful Elizabeth Taylor. Moty Clift provides  a refreshing neutral persona to balance two strong characters in conflict.",961977600,6,1409,4.9025423728813555
490528,5,6302655897,"Suddenly Last Summer is an adaptation from Tennessee Williams' drama rendered on the screen by himself with the assistance of Gore Vidal. Having seen many of the Williams adaptations, I regard this Mankiewicz directed  piece the most successful, not merely for its intriguing use of symbolism,  but also for the presentation of two texts at the very same time. Each and  every viewer can find something in the film to chew on: the surface  structure of the film gives the Hollywood genre of psycho-thriller with  celebrities, and with a touch of a tiny romance; whereas the other text  reveals something completely different. Surprise, surprise: it is not only  Sebastian Venable (the late poet, whose face remains off-screen all the  time) who is homosexual, but our nice ""sugar-cube"" neuro-surgeon, Dr  Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift), too, who does not seem to be enjoying  Catherine Holly's (Elizabeth Taylor) affection (maybe because it is not  exactly directed towards him, but rather towards her late cousin  Sebastian). All's well that ends well: we have the comforting heterosexual  matrix prevailing at the end (for those who buy it), but the shadow of the  doubt still lingers on. That is the extra the film offers more than its  source text, and also, the confident use of cinematic technique and tropes  that make this adaptation a real tour de force.",958608000,14,1361,5.090497737556561

It is a little campy on repeated viewings, but the drama is still so heartfelt.  Monty Clift is still beautiful even after his awful accident and his eyes really are hypnotic, as Liz's character says.  This is a great Southern gothic classic!

7828676,5,6302655897,"This may not be the best movie from director Joseph Mankiewicz, or stars Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift or Katharine Hepburn, but it's a wonderful frightfest in a non-occult way.  Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, lovely Catherine Holly (Taylor), terrorized into near-dementia by the murder of her poet cousin Sebastian on a Spanish trip, must contend with her wealthy aunt Violet (Hepburn), who wants the girl institutionalized and lobotomized.  The promising new surgeon from Chicago, played by Clift, is caught in the middle.

This 1959 B&W feature, based on a play by Tennessee Williams and expanded by Gore Vidal, was intended to shock, but much of that shock depends on (spoiler) the then-taboo nature of Sebastian's homosexuality.  Still, it's scary and at times profound.  Might be worth seeing during Hallowe'en season as a literate and bloodless alternative to the buckets-of-gore horror movie more typical this time of year.  A wonderful supporting cast includes Albert Dekker and Mercedes McCambridge.  Recommended, and currently a good deal.",1507680000,2,1057,5.36969696969697
