8403724,2,B003RHZ6BG,This was billed as a spy series and turned out to be a hokey British version of the 50s Dragnet series in serial form. Okay if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not.,1400976000,,167,3.9411764705882355
8403725,4,B003RHZ6BG,"As a 10 year old boy in 1950 in Scotland Dick Barton was my hero. At 6.45 each night I would listen to a 15minute episode each week night on our WIRELESS, broadcast by the BBC.This DVD is a remarkable reproduction of the original broadcast,the directors have copied the style with great accuracy. Corny but a very enjoyable reminder of my youth. Thank you for stocking this type of entertainment.",1372464000,,396,4.671428571428572
8403726,5,B003RHZ6BG,"A Southern Television Network Production presents ""DICK BARTON SPECIAL AGENT"" (British TV Series) (1979) (335 mins/Color) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Opening with the signature classic theme ""The Devil's Galop"", now we are invited to enter the world of ""Dick Barton Special Agent"" with all 32 episodes --- The two disc set creates the feel of the old radio show that was one of the best on the British airwaves --- Dick Barton - Special Agent was a popular radio program on the BBC Light Program from 1946 to 1951.

Here is some background on my favorite passion which is old-time radio shows, Dick Barton was the BBC's first daily serial, airing at 6.45 each weekday evening --- It featured ex-Commando Captain Richard Barton (Noel Johnson, later Duncan Carse and Gordon Davies) who, with his mates Jock Anderson (Alex McCrindle) and Snowy White (John Mann) solved all sorts of crimes, escaped from dangerous situations and saved the nation from disaster time and again --- At its peak it had an audience of 15 million.

This television release box set from VCI keeps you guessing through the entire series as Barton faces dastardly opponents and villains that don't always deal in fair play --- And so viewers are treated to a tough-talking, no-nonsense, square-jawed private eye, complete with trench coat and fedora, who always gets his man ... and sometimes a woman.
