8284523,5,B001BSBBPI,"Ed Wynn is nearly as funny as the Stooges themselves. The rest of the material is not worth anything as better versions can be found elsewhere, but it is worth it for the Ed Wynn show segment.",1420848000,,192,4.216216216216216

8284525,5,B001BSBBPI,"Here is a DVD for that Three Stooges fan in your life. In my case this was my dad. We watched this together and we laughed the entire time. Also the colorization was true perfection, but like other Legend releases, there is a black and white version for that old Hollywood feel. Cannot go wrong with this one and very recommended to any comedy buff!",1395792000,,349,4.384615384615385
8284526,5,B001BSBBPI,"if you like to laugh then this might be the one for you.i collect all of the three stooges,no matter how many times i watch i still get a laugh.",1346371200,,144,3.8333333333333335
8284527,3,B001BSBBPI,"what is on this dvd is pretty fabulous but there isn't enough to justify splitting this from the other dvds that legend has released.  the main draw is the ed wynn show which runs 30 minutes and has been colorized (which by the way looks pretty great).  its a fun show and i had never seen it unedited though the stooge parts have been on many collections of such material.  so that was a nice touch.

aside from that there are a bunch of trailers which can be found on many other releases fairly regularly these have not been colorized if that makes a difference(i think color would have been a nice touch for the trailers).

the bonus features are pretty short and seem to be clipped from other places the sinatra clip is interesting but in quite poor state.

so theres maybe 37 minutes of good material.  i feel like they could have consolidated the ed wynn and sinatra show onto<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Extreme-Rarities-In-COLOR/dp/B001BSBBOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities - In COLOR!</a>, and put the trailers on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Stooges-Greatest-Routines/dp/B001LNWSMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Stooges: Greatest Routines</a>

still glad to have this disc.  but be warned it is not jam packed like the extreme rarities disc.",1323907200,5,1397,5.876237623762377
8284528,5,B001BSBBPI,"Sure, you've seen the Three Stooges Shorts before.  You probably find them funny; you may even consider a fan.  Some of you might even boast about having seen all of them.  But the Shorts are only a small piece of the Three Stooges pie, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you strictly limit yourself to them.  In fact, some of the Stooges' funniest material comes from things like their live appearances, such as those contained on this Live and Hilarious DVD.  Anyone familiar with comedy can tell you that performing live is a wholly different monster from the structured security of a studio--it's one way to discern true comedic genius from that of a talented scriptwriter.

These Stooge appearances, most of which I can guarantee you haven't seen before, confirm the wealth of ad-libbing talent the knuckleheads possessed.  And, in keeping with the promise on the packaging, all of this material has been fully realized in color for the first time; presenting a truly unique opportunity that likely won't be found elsewhere (not many people are investing time and energy into revitalizing classic films).  What can I say about the colorization?  It's excellent, as far as I can tell.  The images look exactly like the first generation of true-color pictures, and the whole experience adds a new and really cool dimension to the Stooge lexicon.",1227657600,17,1355,4.95575221238938
