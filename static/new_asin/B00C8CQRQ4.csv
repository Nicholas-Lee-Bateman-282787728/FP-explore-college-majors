5699057,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Compelling and complex miniseries about a mythical land and its various, competing kingdoms and characters. Based on the books which are even more detailed than the miniseries, which does a fair job of sorting the storyline out. Sex, violence, knights, beautiful women, love, battles, monsters, dragons, intrigue, everything one might want in a medieval saga. I usually do not like fake ancient kingdom films or stories, but this one is great, an exception. The acting is fine, the costumes beautiful, recreation of the kingdoms brilliant and the suspense thrilling. The viewer is left longing for more! We are caught up in the personal lives of the characters and care about them. But just as you are rooting for a particular favorite, he or she may be suddenly and violently eliminated. More twists and turns than one can imagine. Great fun and riveting action.",1368748800,3,863,5.041958041958042
5699058,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"This series is for fear of repeating myself, awesome.
The casting director should be lauded, not since Lord of the Rings has anyone done such a spectacular job of selection. The story line stays close to the book with out been too slavish and the art direction, costumes and locales are faultless. Anyone who does not give this series a go is missing a treat.",1368230400,12,359,4.538461538461538
5699059,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"I'm sure many fans of the TV series are tired of hearing the elitist opinions of those who have read the books. I'm fully aware of the type of person who falls in love with a book, or graphic novel, or video game, or whatever, and finds any adaptation that deviates in any way from the source material to be complete and utter crap. I want to begin this review by saying that I am not this type of person. The first two seasons of Game of Thrones I found to be utterly brilliant. Even the filler, or the areas in which the show deviated from the books was marvelous. The acting was superb, even the child actors for this show are in rare form compared to what you see in shows such as The Walking Dead. The first season blew everybody away, both long time fans of the book series, and those new to the world of Westeros. The second season cashed the check that the first season wrote, building upon the epic promise of the first season finale. Then came season three...

Before I get into the specific failings of the third season, I'm going to state for everybody the underlying cause of 90% of this season's problems. Greed. The studios trying to gouge more money out of the fans (and they have the balls to charge 40% more for the DVD/BR?!). The third book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords, has a lot happening in it. So using this excuse, the studio decided to divide the book into two seasons in order to show all the content. Since one thousand pages obviously does not fill 20 hours of television, they gave us lots of filler in order to fill time, like Margery and Sansa talking about boys. Furthermore, the actual content from the book moved at a snail's pace. Jon Snow took an entire episode just to climb the wall.

Now I would be able to forgive this, if it weren't for the fact that they actually cut out some of the important characters and things from the book. All the jokes about Podd's bedroom performance could maybe have been cut to actually give real screen time to Mance Rayder or Tormund? One of the most important plot points in the book is Jon's conflict between his oath to the Night's Watch and his sympathy for the Wildling cause. The show makes Mance Rayder seem like the typical generic tribal warlord, and Tormund is just some giant ginger whose name is only mentioned once. I want to see Mance playing the flute, and Tormund telling outrageous stories about his member. The only wildling that is portrayed as even remotely sympathetic is Ygritte. And even that seems less so after she shoots Jon half a dozen times with arrows. Not to mention we get to see barely anything of Barristan Selmy. And who is Strong Belwas again?

One of my biggest complaints here is also they they butchered (no pun intended) the Red Wedding. The most infamous scene in the entire series, and they messed it up. First of all, it would have been cinematic gold had they actually played the Reins of Castemere during the massacre, rather than playing the entire song, and then beginning the killings. Putting the right music to the right scene is something that you can only get in film or television, and it would have been something even the books couldn't show. Huge opportunity missed there. I also felt as though the gore and blood were unnecessarily cartoonish at some points. The throat slashing effects were straight out of Sweeney Todd, and the stomach stabbing scene felt unrealistic and awkward. Finally the scene were Robb actually gets stabbed. It would have been more dramatic to show Roose approaching him while he was on his knees, as it did in the books, then to just have him pop on screen and then off again like the 1990s animated Batman.

Now this isn't to say that the season didn't have its high points. The scene where Danaerys liberates Slaver's Bay and gains her unsullied army was one of the best in the entire show. In fact most of the Essos scenes were well done. Although I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of Barristan Selmy. Also the scene where Jamie saves Brienne from the bear was fantastic. Ultimately though, the glowing parts of this season were bogged down by too much crap. The worst part is that they've painted themselves into a corner where season 4 is concerned, once again working only with half a book. Hopefully they will find a way to better manage their content.",1366761600,82,4341,4.498098859315589
5699060,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"In the past 2 seasons amazon released an instant video after the show aired on HBO. This year, however, they are not doing this. I'm assuming they will not be releasing any instant videos this year and just the DVD set at the end of season 3? Why are they doing this? Is it some contractual issue with HBO or something? I DO NOT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL JUNE TO WATCH THESE EPISODES!!! I started reading through the books for the second time (currently halfway through the third book) anticipating that I would be able to watch the episodes on Amazon Instant Video. So far they haven't released any episodes.... WHY!!",1366588800,15,611,4.513513513513513
5699061,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"If this package is anything like the previous second and now re-released first complete seasons, it will be worth the price completely. I assuming this because it's been proven twice by now and also among other HBO releases. Therefore, what I expect or hope will be the return of the

5 blu-ray discs containing the ten episode season in 1080p picture and wonderful HD surround sound (with the fifth containing interesting special features, like season two's the animated history of Westeros),
two dual layer season DVD with all ten episode set,
and a digital season copy code where you can choose either redeem it with Amazon, UltraViolet, iTunes, or other instant streaming website.

My suggestion for anybody purchasing this through Amazon.com, please redeem at least one of you digital HD copies through Amazon.com. Not only is it more friendly than the likes of UV or iTunes, but YOU ACTUALLY GET TO DOWNLOAD A DIGITAL VERSION WHILE YOU HAVE A STREAMED COPY THAT IS PLAYABLE IN OTHER VIDEO PLAYBACK FORMATS. Sorry for the caps usage there, but there is no way to stress how more superior Amazon video is compared to the likes of iTunes's idiotic DRM usage where you have to only use a device that can use iTunes. Sorry, Apple, but if I own a ""digital copy,"" I better fully own a digital copy of a TV season or movie. This is best way to own Game of Thrones!

Also, I would like to note that in the past, The price listed now will not be the actual price for this season set. I have purchased both seasons through Amazon.com for a discounted price knocking at least $20.00 off the original price (and yes for the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital set). If any of you are interested, please pre-order this either now and get it discounted, or wait till the season is fully announced on the website and pre-purchase it at a discounted price.

HBO has finished airing all ten episodes of this season and I'm sure that the show is renewed for at least 2 more. Especially since the source material for this season is literally half of the Storm of Swords novel, there is much to cover yet.  And wow! Just wow at the final two episodes of the season. The production company for this series is not afraid at all to show off what George Martin has in store for his characters. Major surprises and changes will occur that will surprise the unknowing viewer and also the devout A Song of Ice and Fire fan (also known as the, ""they actually showed that!?"" synopsis). Nit picky fans will point out what was changed be it dialogue or missing characters, but so far they seem minor but still entertaining to say the least. So far, Game of Thrones is still the best from book source to Live action TV fantasy series you will find.",1366588800,223,2705,4.580578512396694
5699062,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"I was hesitant about buying the latest series of Game of Thrones, but it was probably worth it.  Then they go and raise the price like 40% ?!?.  I will never again buy an HBO  series, DVD, or even watch it. Fire the one or two execs that made this irrevocably stupid decision to poison their followers. You will reap what you sow. I am also cancelling my HBO subscription on cable out of disgust. Some people need to retire early at HBO or whoever is responsible.",1366416000,80,463,4.2988505747126435
5699063,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of thrones is awesome, you should all buy it.  That's the extent of my review.  Now I'm going to troll HBO and readers here with a sassy op-ed because I am tired of hbo's foolishness:

Dear HBO, you just don't get it.  People want to be able to buy a season and then watch them as they 'pop'.  If cable companies are strongarming you, pull a 'Prince' or rather 'the artist formerly known as Prince' but now again known as 'Prince'

Create a company 'nuHBO', then move all your content rights to it.  Offer this for free to all subscribers to HBO.  Buy more channels if you have to.

Then, fill HBO with static 24x7, after cable companies dump you for having no content anymore, for being recalcitrant and obnoxious and difficult, then switch back to HBO or even 'HBO Classic' and then make all your video content available on Amazon, Google Play and Apple.

It's 2013 guys.  Article published saying Netflix streaming has surpassed tv watching.  Consumers are waiting in line with money in hand to give to you.  All my friends have ditched cable and use Netflix + Amazon + Hulu set top boxes.  GET WITH IT.  Cable is dead.

Comcast will live on because they own Paramount and NBC, but otherwise, their main thing is dead.

Want to ride that horse over a cliff?  Or join our picnic here, in Amazon instant video world.",1365897600,36,1322,4.483193277310924

5699065,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I am not a reader of fantasy, but I must confess these 5-books written by George R.R. Martin are the best books I have ever read in a very very long time. I have been following the series on HBO for the last three years. If you haven't read the books I recommend it because there is so much more in the books that it is nearly impossible for the producers and directors to put on screen. Parents a word of caution, the content of this series is not for children. This has adult content, material, and scenes that may not be suitable for young children. The screen version of the books is so very close to the storyline. It is incredibly exciting and well done, the actors and actresses are superb. The locations inwhich the movie was filmed is also incredible. Seasons 1 and 2 are apart of my video libary and I have already pre-ordered season 3. I am hooked and you will be to. If you don't have HBO on your cable line-up, buy the DVDs you won't regret it. Buy it now!",1365724800,12,969,4.21505376344086
5699066,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game Of Thrones Season 3 Blu-Ray available February 18th, 2014

I am a huge fan of the books and the show. I have Inside HBO's Game Of Thrones: Collector's Edition book, A Feast of Ice and Fire Cookbook, and even pre-ordered The World of Ice and Fire: The Official History of Westeros and The World of A Game of Thrones. I play the Game of Thrones board game almost every Saturday with my friends. I even have the comic book and have coasters and a Targaryen t-shirt. I also have the first two seasons on Blu-Ray (pre-ordered them here like 6 months in advance). I am a huge fan of the series.

A Game of Thrones (book 1 in the Song of Ice and Fire book series) covered the first season. A Clash of Kings (book 2) was told in the second season. A Storm of Swords (book 3) however, is so meaty that D.B. Weiss and David Benioff want to cut out nothing of importance so it will span this season (season 3) and the next season (season 4). So for those who haven't watched this season yet, minor *spoilers* ahead. I won't give away anything too important and will keep these episode reviews mainly as a synopsis, and I won't complain about what's different from the book to screen adaptation, I promise.

This show has it all, mystery, drama, action, sex and nudity, monsters, magic and political intrigue. It's shot all over the world (Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia, and Iceland) and the sets and costume design are amazing. Music by Ramin Djawadi is brooding, heavy, sad and exciting. This show is adult in nature and content, but speaks to the kid in me who dreams of sword fighting, joining battles and fighting for freedom, battling monsters and seeing Dragons and exotic women. This show is easily one of the best shows ever created. It's up there with The Wire, Breaking Bad, Lost, Shameless, Deadwood, Doctor Who, The Walking Dead and Justified. Shows that are pure escapism and a bit fantasy that are grounded in reality of the Human condition and that people can relate to. Granted I don't think any of us can relate to seeing sword fights and White Walkers or Dragons flying around, yet we can all relate to losing loved ones, being betrayed, and standing up for what is right and just. This show is an epic masterpiece, a classic that is sure to be talked about for years to come. FULLY APPROVED.",1365292800,,2307,4.514354066985646

5699112,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"If I had written this review years ago I wouldve given the product a three star review. Game of Thrones is a five star series, but I hated the packages the DVDs came in. Each year Ive bought the DVDs as soon as they are available and hated the packages, wishing HBO would put the DVDs in some decent plastic snap cases. After buying seven seasons of the folding cardboard contraptions Ive learned to live with them. Now I see season one DVDs in plastic snap cases being sold at Walmart! Frickin HBO.

Game of Thrones has been my favorite show since it started, which was a big surprise to me. I remember watching the ads for it back when The Walking Dead was my favorite show, which it won by default after Battlestar Galatica ended. The Game of Thrones ads looked boring to me. I thought the show was going to be another mediocre costume drama. Boy was I wrong.

Ive read the six Game of Thrones books between seasons and I re-watch every episode of every season starting with episode one each year before the next season begins.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521936000,,2455,5.205063291139241

Pros the same as previous seasons: Excellent acting, story lines, costumes, sets, etc. Many new characters and dives a little deeper into the supernatural elements of the series. Large array of special features.

Surprising twists/turns this season and, yet again, main characters get killed off.  Episode 4 had the best ending, IMO. But due to the Con below keep the fast forward button handy while watching this season.

The only Con is the same as last season: This could be a 5 star series all the way, but it has too many explicit scenes depicting brutality/depravity towards women/children/etc. This season was a bit worse than the last. Removed 2 stars from rating for this.

However, with that being said, I did finish it because the story is phenomenal, the sets are amazing, the costumes are breath taking....and the acting is well pretty darn good...I was disappointed with the unnecessary pornographic sex and extreme violence. The story is so great and a lot of those situations could be ""implied"" rather than camera in your face stuff. I thought HBO could have told the story without all the graphic violence and still maintained a phenomenal fantastical story.  It could have been right up there with Lord of the Rings.....Unfortunately they chose to cheapen it.

5699359,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"NEW REVIEW:

No one is perfect; even TheMADhatter makes mistakes, on rare occasions.  I had previously given GOT (Game of Thrones, in case you're living under a rock, and aren't familiar with the acronym) two stars, and criticized it for falling into the pitfalls and ailments common to other TV series.  (READ BELOW TO SEE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW).

I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG!  At the end of season three, I came to be under the impression that the writers of this show were ""winging"" the story, in an effort to drag the show on.  At that point, based on the plot and flow of the story, I was under the impression that the writers of this show were not following a set story, but were falling into the same recipe for failure that previous TV series like Surface, Hereos, and Lost adopted.

As I said in my previous review, these shows clearly did not have a set story, from the outset, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Instead, each one simply started with an idea, and then the writers simply continued to expand and convolute the story to keep it going for as long as possible, until the Networks decided to cancel them (after only a single season, in the case of Surface).  On the other hand, what made the TV Series ""ROME"" so good was that - unlike these others -  the TV show was commissioned with a set story, from the outset.  This meant that, instead of each episode being written by a different writer causing the show's story to spin out of control, each individual episode and the overall story were harmonious and congruent.

As I said, at the end of season 3 of GOT, it appeared to me that the writers were stretching and expanding the story to keep the series running for as long as possible.  HOWEVER, this was not the case.

After swearing off the show, I ended up coming back to it, and watching seasons 4, 5, 6, & now 7.  I now realize that what I took for shallow, melodramatic, writing, was - in fact - intricately complex and well-thought-out writing.  The writers of GOT did have a set story from the outset, with a beginning, a middle, and an end, and they never strayed from it ... not even once.  Not only did they have a set story from the outset, it is a remarkably well-written and intricately complex story.

At the end of season 3 I had thought the writing was getting sloppy and that the show would end up leaving many issues it had raised unanswered.  In fact, the story was far more detailed than I had realized, and it eventually answers every question or issue ever raised in great, precise, detail.  The detail of the story is along the lines of JRR Tolkien's Silmarillion.

I've become so used to the poor writing commonly dribbled out of Hollywood, that I never imagined that this show would include such a precisely written and harmonious story, but that is exactly what the GOT story involves.

When I wrote my critical review below, after only 3 seasons, I was not far enough into the story to yet appreciate its complexity.

LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE PEOPLE:  If you don't like GOT and find yourself being critical of it ... it is probably because you do not understand it yet.  Keep watching to the end, and then draw your conclusion.  My conclusion is that GOT is a superbly written show, and that it is the best show to have been released in the recent past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY PREVIOUS REVIEW (Where I gave it two stars):

I'm done watching this show.  If you're wondering when I quit, it was Season 3, episode 9.  I'll avoid including any spoilers, but let me just say that I enjoyed watching it until the show betrayed the viewers.  Once a show betrays its viewers, I QUIT!

There are three types of people in this world. 1) People who watch TV series; 2) People who HATE TV series and never watch them; and 3) People who will watch TV series ONLY when they don't suffer from the typical ailments common to the genre.

Personally, I'm in the third category.  It took almost all the way through the Third Season, before it was clear to me that I was WASTING MY TIME!

I've only made it through a few TV series, from start to finish.  Rome, by Showtime, was an excellent TV series.  Why was it so good?  Because it wasn't just written to keep people blindly watching each week.  It had a start, and a finish and a story in-between, all written BEFORE they ever started shooting the first episode.  IN other words, it was written like a long movie.

Take another TV series, the show ""HEROES.""  I watched this series as well.  Episode after episode ,waiting for the villain to finally meet his match and be killed.  However, it never happened.  Instead, after watching hours and hours of the show, when the showdown finally happened, the showdown I had been waiting for, for episode after episode, the show threw all of its established ""rules"" out the window, and let villain win.

Why?  Who knows.  Probably because they knew that millions of people were also watching waiting for him to be defeated, and the TV networks decided it was their cash cow.  Why create a new cash cow.  If the people are all watching because they want to see him finally destroyed, then - why - we'll just never kill him. I quit watching the show immediately, as did all of my friends.  Aside from the fact that the show was now absurd, it was obvious to me ""why"" the network was doing it.

Shows like Heroes and Lost were NEVER coherent pieces of fiction.  Instead, they were both contradicting pieces of garbage, whose story lines were constantly manipulated by TV network executives, whose only goal was to milk out as many viewers as they could THAT WEEK, with no regard to the viewer  in terms of producing a quality long-term show.

SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH:

Well, here we go again.  You might as well take every character you care about, from the ENTIRE FIRST THREE SEASONS of this show, and just assume they are all going to die.  After watching three seasons, you will feel like it was a COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR TIME.  By the end of season three, the show is just like the others.  A mixed up hodge-podge bunch of garbage, with a million storylines running simultaneously, NONE OF WHICH EVER REACHES A SATISFACTORY FINISH!!  NEVER!  IT JUST DRONES ON AND ON, and after three seasons you CARE ABOUT NO ONE OR ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SHOW.

I quit.  The wedding scene, at the end.  Well, it just showed me that these writers, for this show as well, have no regard for betraying the viewer.",1498608000,2,6615,4.6231759656652365

5699404,2,B00C8CQRQ4,"For the show itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough.  I think it's extraordinary.  But I'm rating the DVD sets here.  I purchased Seasons 1-6 as the separate sets, have watched them all and I'm just shocked and frankly angry at what poor quality these are.  The picture is just awful, particularly in scenes that are dark.  Think VHS quality.  I do not exaggerate. And it's every season, though oddly enough, some episodes are worse than others.

I really don't understand this.  I have many other shows on DVD, including HBO ones, and none of them are like this.  Muddy, blotchy, artifact-laden image quality, and sometimes even skipping.  For disclaimer's sake no, it is not my player, not my TV (I've tried them on a few players and screens), and these are the legit, licensed sets.

Then there's the packaging itself.  The ""fat"" sets that fold out with a disk on each page (versus the ""stacked disk"" sets) are also crap.  The plastic disk holders have a tendency to come unglued from the cardboard backings. I've heard others mention the same issue.  Again, I have other sets with a similar design and this doesn't happen with those.  What the heck is going on with the quality control where they're making these?  GoT deserves better.

Anyway, I can't recommend buying these.  And considering some of the problems I've heard with the BluRay disks, too (and my own negative experiences with BluRay players which makes me steer clear of converting over to that format), I'm not tempted to purchase again.  I'd recommend renting the shows instead and save your money, perhaps check a local library for them.  I may, in fact, donate my sets, as I'm not sure I could stand watching them again.

We see the story progress a bit more than in season 2, and the events surrounding Theon Greyjoy are some of the most gruesome ever.  This continues the same great pace and epic scale.

5701064,3,B00C8CQRQ4,I'm new to this series and am about mid way through season 3. It is a great show. I will say I'm a bit disappointed with Amazon. I didn't check the price past the first couple of seasons because they were the same price. I looked today and saw that the other seasons are $99 which is $60 more than the earlier seasons. Why not sell them as a bundle with the option to purchase individual seasons? I really like the show but not sure I'm ready to spend $99 on the newer seasons especially considering other popular shows on networks have 5-8 more episodes more per season.,1469145600,,571,4.296296296296297
5701065,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Need to bring this up off the bat. Series three for me contained more scenes of gore, torture and psychological catastrophes than any of the series before it, it also contained the usual amount of nudity and swear words... so how is this the season that's rated a 15 when the previous seasons were 18s? Its mad! I digress.
Definitely the strongest season so far with more twists and turns, betrayals and life changing events. Introducing a few new characters, namely the evil Ramsey Snow of house Bolton (If you thought Joffrey was bad wait until you get a load of this lunatic). As previously quiet and obedient houses and bannermen begin to make a mark for themselves on westeros.

Stannis licks his wounds after his defeat in season two, becoming ever more obsessed with his new God and the Red Woman Melisandre, desperately trying to recuperate and get back in the game as a contender for the throne. Making life hard for his ever suffering but loyal second in command Davos as he attempts to reason with his Zealot obsessed king. Davos is such a likeable character and his loyalty to Stannis is both heart warming and heart breaking as we watch Davos desperately play off and counter the many savage suggestions of the religious Melisandre, with great chemistry between all three characters you can feel the tension in the room with every scene as the two confidants battle for their kings mind which is forever unbalanced and as likely to take either side depending on his mood.

Daenerys begins her liberation of slavers bay quickly gaining momentum and power throughout the series in the way only the dragon born can, quickly becoming the most powerful character in the show, gathering more and more allies to her cause, she becomes seemingly unstoppable, yet remains one of the viewers favourite candidates for the throne as she shows again and again compassion and fairness for the people she comes into contact with, really becoming the light in this dark world. Followed by her loyal and love struck aid Jorah he also has new challenges to face as he finds himself in competition with the new allies flocking to her side, including the humiliated Commander of the Kings Guard from season one Ser Barristen Selmy and the handsome Daario Naharis of the Second Sons mercenaries.

Robb Stark once again faces betrayal as he attends his grandfathers funeral in River Run, introducing us at last to the Tullys including the humorous Blackfish and the Mr Bean of Westeros; Edmure Tully. Watching Robb struggle to handle the political aspect is quite sad as we watch the young wolf, who has never lost a battle decline purely due to his lack of political leadership and his restricting honour, both marching him towards a fate like his fathers. The similarities between Ned and Robb become more apparent as he makes foolish decisions all in vain attempts to do the right thing or make up for mistakes made, all culminating in one of the most memorable and terrible scenes of the entire show.

Theon Greyjoy, probably has the worst time of it in this season, after his betrayal of Robb in season two he finds himself captured by an unknown assailant and very very violently tortured both Physically and psychologically as well as mutilated, forever distorting and changing the character into somebody entirely new. Despite his betrayals and actions in season two you really begin to feel for the character again very early on, even forgiving his actions as he confesses how he really feels about himself and is made the play thing of the sadistic Ramsey Snow. Some fantastic acting done by both actors in all of their scenes really making for a horrible experience for viewers, i fear this may be the last season we ever see Theon Greyjoy...

Tyrion continues to play the game in kings landing, battling with his sister for their fathers approval who has now taken his place as Hand of the King. Tyrion now has a harder time keeping his head above water, struck from all his power by his father, Tyrion is left vulnerable to the cruelty of Joffrey who continues to enjoy torturing his subjects. Watching him keep his composure under such odds and witnessing the cruelty of his father first hand, Tyrion remains a solid favourite of the fans, who after his heroes exploits in season two deserves a lot more than he gets in this season.

Jon Snow follows his new Wildling lifestyle while ever secretly looking for an opportunity to escape back to his fellow men of the nights watch, Jon Snow begins to realise the real threat to Westeros and begins to understand that the only way to win the real war is unity... something nobody else wants. Breaking his nights watch vows and literally skating on real thin ice Jon begins to craft himself as the hero Westeros needs.

Jaime Lannister continues life as captive, with the ever honourable and faithful Brienne charged with transporting him the two run into all sorts of adventures on their way to Kings Landing, including run ins with not so honourable Stark Soldiers, farmers and then the sadistic soldiers of house Bolton and their leader Lock. Survival looks bleak for the pair and as Jaime attempts his usual charm and smarmy talk to get out of a situation it backfires changing his life forever, if he survives.

Overall, definitely the best season so far, completely shifting the power around the country and countless heartbreaking revelations and moments, this is the defining season that will make and break lifelong fans, if you though the execution of Ned Stark was the pinnacle of Game of Thrones, that seems like child's play after this season.",1469145600,,5606,4.802072538860104

5701139,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"My husband and I were quickly captivated in season 1 episode 1 by the character development and story line.  It became increasingly difficult to continue watching however, given the over the top sex and violence.  Felt like we were watching porn at times and the violence overpowered seemingly everything else.  We hit the end point on the ""Red Wedding"" episode.  Violence and sexual content definitely has its place, but we were often left wondering that shows such as these help fuel real life violence when this kind of entertainment has the ability to desensitize individuals.  It must take some questionable personalities in terms of writers, producers to execute these shows with such perverted, violent cinematography.  In reading the online chatter, apparently we are not alone in our views.  We are so sorry to bow out of what is a cultural phenomenon and other wise would be a great source of entertainment for us.  To the producers:  please, please consider what you put out to your viewers, many of whom are young and still forming their psyche's.  I am a child psychologist and my husband a 40 year high school history teacher.",1468540800,,1140,4.9214659685863875

5701345,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I bought this mainly for the collectible steelbook and magnet.

 MULTIPLE COPIES 
You get three different copies of the series:
1) Blu-ray (physical discs)
2) UltraViolet 1080p HD version (digital copy, HD only available on some devices)
3) iTunes 1080p HD version (digital copy)

The digital code gives you two digital versions (which is rare and appreciated).

 STEELBOOK and MAGNET 
This steelbook has artwork designed by Elastic, the agency that created the Emmy Award-winning opening credits, and has a magnet on the cover that can be removed and used as a regular magnet, or left on to show off as a collector's piece. Each season represents one of the major houses of the series, and this season three steelbook represents House Frey with The Twins bridge as its sigil on the magnet. The steelbook is in a matching decorative plastic outer case that holds the magnet in place so it doesn't scratch the steelbook. Depending on how this was shipped, this plastic may or may not be cracked as I've seen a lot of cracked plastic cases with the steelbook intact.

 THE SHOW 
The show is greatin acting, in storytelling, in visuals, in music, and in writing. I've watched everything at least three times, and there are so many new things you see when re-watching, and with the knowledge of future episodes. The third season has a lot of incredible shocks you won't see coming, and some that are very much foreshadowed to those that pay attention. It will certainly be one of the most memorable seasons you will ever watch on television.

I have converted many friends who previously used to think this was about ""dungeons and dragons and lord of the rings,"" (like I did) who are now *all* addicted to the show. If you don't already know, this show isn't about what you think it may be about.

This is currently THE only good show on television, and if you don't like it, you probably don't understand good television (sorry, not sorry). It has been the number one torrented show in every single year since it came out for a reason (which is a blessing and curse for the producers). After watching this, everything else on TV becomes: ""why I am watching all these other crappy shows?""

This is one of those series that I will buy the individual season sets, and whatever big box set comes out in the future. GAME OF THRONES! Recommended.",1465862400,8,2337,4.698529411764706

5701564,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"I would say the series is finally getting a lot better. My main complaint of cutting off scenes too quickly and not letting them play out has vastly improved. We also get more politics (mostly via marriage alliances) intrigue as well as Dragon Lady finally getting a personality as the benevolent freedom dragon rider.

I know the Red Wedding is the big shocker but by 2016 as I watched this for the first time even knowing it was going to happen, thank goodness it did. I was tired of the depressing and politically naive Starks from Season One onwards especially Queenie Catelyn. The only Starks worth watching are still alive--Air-Ya Jordan and Sansabelt. The other, Riccon is just there (why is he even in this as he adds zero to the plot?). His brother, Bran Flake, now sees stuff in his dreams and is joined by the Love Actually Boy now grown up having Liam Neeson apparently letting him wander Westeros. All that stuff set in the North and the Wall with the Wildings, the White Walkers and anything with a W in it simply is a bore. Just get us back to the cities of the South, please, where the sun shines and people don't just meander around landscape.

Jon Snow (who apparently must be referred to by his full name all the time) falls in love with the girl from Pixar's Brave whom I call Scottish Highland Lassie. Their banter is the only entertaining thing about the land where snow is everywhere and I keep thinking about the Echo & the Bunnymen's cover shot for their album Porcupine. Although, having said that, I do enjoy Rollie Pollie Boy of the Knight's (or is it Night's?) Watch, but the woman and her baby he saves are kind of a bland canvas.

At least now we learn what the people who have ships and live on islands are like. The conclusion: Just as boring as the Starks. Sure the Fire Lady giving birth to a Smoke Monster is odd, but I liked her much better when she was in Holland during the Nazi Occupation in Black Book (a terrific movie made in 2006 prior to Europe turning into the Medieval Age in 2011 with Plate Of Scones).

Oh, yeah, that Theon (or Theoff) Greynojoy becomes a dillwad, gets his comeuppance and now there's a bigger d-bag than him in Reese's Pieces Bolton Wanderers who is basically a psychotic torturer. That whole story thread I could do without. Kill the both of them off quickly, please.

Other than that, it takes way too long before the Girts' High School Gym Teacher Knight to get Jaime Spelled Wrong Lameystairs back to King's Landing. We need more Ham-ez Now One Hand-ister in Season Four. Old Emma Peel now shows up and looks like we need more of her as she's got a quick wit and who knows, maybe John Steed will show up as well.

Anyway, most of the Starks are toast, one war is done and the dragons got bigger. Even so the Snow Zombies will kill everyone in the end unless global warming speeds the heck up.

The extras on this DVD box set are lame vs. Season Two's excellent extras--usual commentary tracks, deleted/extended and extremely short look at the borefest Wildlings (I think I don't love you because you do not make anything groovy) and the whole marriage/political alliance in case you fell asleep back in PoliSci 101 or Medieval Fantasyland 205.",1462579200,,3214,4.512027491408935

It had already been out for some time and I was able to binge watch (which is always good for me). Let me tell you, I was hooked. I love the intricate characters, the ever changing story and multiple plot lines. You are never bored watching this show.

I will say that if you are an emotional TV viewer, such as myself (I am a cryer and get connected easily with characters) you will find yourself in tears, raging mad and upset throughout the show. The point is, it is a good enough show to draw you in and make you part of the experience.

This show has left me soaring, left me sad, made me angry, made me cry, made me laugh, made my day. It is thought provoking and entertaining all at the same time. Love it.",1461110400,,802,4.069620253164557

5701805,1,B00C8CQRQ4,Unfortunately the 1% have turned the arts into their own private vacations on film.  Lazy is a good place to start when the franchises and actors travel the World in luxury and only produce 10 episodes per year one who expect far more than the lack of talent and originality that was delivered or not.....Maybe Americans will get off their couches stop funding these 1% parties or at least demand more for our money - personally - I'm very disappointed and feel quite ripped off and taken for a ride but not a movie ride.,1458172800,,521,4.484210526315789

Update 01.26.16:
Season 3 Episode 9 was a little too much for me. I don't mind blood and gore sometimes but there are some scenes I could have definitely went without seeing. I am a woman with children (and have experienced losses) and certain things upset me. I have heard that this is just the start of scenes like what I saw, so I am unsure if I will continue to watch. I will probably still buy the rest of the seasons but if things get heinous I will just browse Facebook instead while my husband watches LOL.",1453248000,,578,4.207207207207207

And this wouldn't bother most people but I have OCD with things looking perfect. Purchase it a great series but don't peal of your sticker.

I keep the disc box separate from this, so not an issue. Just does its job at displaying my GoT fandom in a small way.  Its too bad they haven't done anything really similar since, guess they got too many complaints, which I can understand, I would have preferred a stronger and heavier material, but overall I still really enjoy this item, and of course the show is amazing, but you already knew that!",1448928000,,732,4.104895104895105

Like the books, story and character development are exceptional.  I've read all the books twice, so I do know what is going to happen with the story.  Still, it is delightful to SEE the characters, the settings, and the action on screen.  This is very unlike me; I usually read a great book and find I'm not interested in seeing the movie.

Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!",1446336000,,885,5.23943661971831

5703198,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"Aside from my problems with the deviations from the books, my big problem is with the quality and design of the Blu-rays. There is no memory (if you press stop, you have to start over from the beginning every time, you can't press play and continue from where you left off), and every disc advertises special features in the menu that you can click on which aren't on that disc. If you ""play all"" episodes, when they are over, it tells you to put in the next disc. If you go back to the main menu, you can't hit ""play all"" again - it just says to put in the next disc. After watching all of the episodes, I like to watch through with commentary, which means that I then have to go through episode by episode. For the price, I would think that HBO could put in some of the basic features we have come to expect on DVDs/Blu-rays.",1432771200,,827,4.175

5703212,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"A lot of good people die, but so do a lot of bad people. I sometimes feel like I should volunteer as a helper at the morgue for this series. But this series is beyond reproach. I have not read the books and have no intention of doing so. I read history, literature, mythology, poetry, you get the picture. But as a diversion from the hard work of reading, this series is the non-pareil. And it's a benchmark for production values. And the acting is uniformly excellent. Of course, adventure stories, whether set on the ancient past, the present or the future essentially follow the scenario I associate with STAR TREK., namely, the plot is one goddam thing after another. But when the cast includes actors of the caliber of Peter Dinklage, Ian Glen, Glenna Headley, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, etc. ad infinitum (sic), the intriques, set-backs, romances, ambushes, intimacies, arguments, whirligigs, fights and battles, curious lore, etc. ad infinitum, all fall into their archetypal niches, and we hardly feel any guilt in pursuing this guilty pleasure. It's really that good. One sign of its excellence. As the credits roll by for each episode the music playing behind them has been composed to fit the mood and extend it in  our minds. And there are surprises: after the episode when the wedding party is murdered in a horrific mass murder, including Rob's pregnant wife and the Matriarch herself, the credits rolled by in absolute silence. That shows a production team which is really paying attention. I have the highest respect for their creativity and integrity. These episodes have been among televisions's finest hours. I mean that in complete sincerity.",1432512000,,1665,4.967741935483871

5703247,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"What can I say?  It's Game of Thrones. The set has fancy layers of plastic and cardboard to get through before you get to the dvds which are nearly impossible to pull out of the fancy layers of plastic and cardboard!  The set has a few extra features which will take up some of your time when you're not busy. There is a small poster of the throne room and the throne of knives. There is a insert mentioning the HBO shop were you can buy all manner of expensive GoT dust collectors...I mean ""collectibles"".  (Thanks to this T.V. series I will have to break down some day and buy George R.R. Martins ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series). Barring the nonsense that went into The Making of the Third Season of Game of Thrones Boxed Set, GoT is one of my top four favorite T.V. series.

I absolutely need to mention the other three in order of perfectness:  Gotham, The Walking Dead and American Horror Story. (An also mention is most of the Syfy series.  That channel seems to have a knack to pile up one good sci-fi series after another.  You go Syfy!)",1432080000,,1051,4.304568527918781

At least in season 3, some of those plots are more comprehensible. The power of Kalisi is expanding as well as her humanity. I fear for Sansa, who doesn't seem to have the hutzpa to protect herself...hopefully she will ""get smart"".  Jon Snow's part seems to be fading in the early episodes of season 3, wonder what will become of him?  Movement and consolidation of kingdoms towards a common enemy seems to be moving in that direction. Still, there is quite a lot of confusion with so many kingdoms. Love the locations, scenery, costumes and cinematography. The programs appear to have cost a lot to set up. In the long run, I think this program (Seasons 1,2,3 will be among my classic collection). I have season 4 but have not watched it yet. May go back to season 2 for clarification before advancing.  Still, I remain disappointed in the porno as it does not advance the stories and seems unnecessarily distracting to the progress of themes and plots. (Not in the books as my grand child has told me.)",1431216000,,1145,4.630541871921182

I realize that the author of the books and the producers of the show put the sexual violence there because it's a matter of harsh reality that where there are males and females, there is sexual violence. Still, lost a star for sexual violence due to how strongly I feel about the subject. Wish it wasn't part of the books or the show.

Same as the other seasons. As true to the books as can be.

I updated the player firmware, same problem. Tried another Blu-ray player with up-to-date software, and the disc glitched in the same places, though at least didn't hang the player, requiring a restart.

This is consistent with the poor disc quality reported by others. Unfortunately, I am past the Amazon 30-day return window. Maybe HBO will make good on these defective discs?

5703613,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"I'm sorry. I know lots of people love this series. I'm not sure we are watching the same show. This show is slow, ponderous, predictable and boring. It's seems to be designed for pre-adolescents and adolescent boys. The plots are stupid and simple. The Starks seem incredibly naive, clumsy and dumb. The Lannisters are also dumb and perverted, homicidal maniacs. In fact, the first and only response to every character in the show seems to be to kill someone in the most brutal, sadistic way possible as an answer to every problem. How long would any of these people survive in the real world? How would they deal with a plague like what happened back in the real Middle Ages? Stab it? By the way, the weapons used are primitive. Apparently everyone in Westeros is too stupid to have invented gunpowder the way China did in the Middle Ages. Any thoughtful or scholarly person in this show is presented as weak, female or gay. Real men and women in this show only know how to kill, get drunk and/or have sex with anyone and anything. The action is minimal. Women are all treated like second class citizens or slaves. There is no humor in it at all. The atmosphere is always grey, dull and dismal. There's a lot of nudity, sex and violence thrown in for purely gratuitous reasons that have nothing to do with the story. It takes forever for anything significant to happen. Also, why is everyone British? Isn't this supposed to be a mythical place with all different types of people? No wizards or witches either. No. The Red Woman doesn't count. Those special effects are sooo expensive. That's why they never have any. If you want to put yourself to sleep this show is for you or you can try more grown-up entertainment elsewhere.
Finally, has anyone who writes fantasy or science fiction ever heard of the word democracy? No. What  Dragon Queen's offers of freedom is not democracy. She still expects the people she frees to serve her instead in her war of unification. They are just exchanging one master for another. Why is everything in these shows based on a feudal type government? The writers of these books, movies and shows need more imagination.",1427760000,2,2154,4.668421052631579

Will Tyrion survive the royal courts accusations?  Will Tywin get the prodigal heir he always wants?  You will just have to watch the season to find out.

PARENTAL WARNING: There is a lot of extreme violence, extreme nudity and extreme sexual violence. In my opinion this series is not for teens, even those you would normally allow to watch R rated shows. This is strictly an adult show. Adults are capable of seeing the violence as relative to the times in which it is portrayed and see it in perspective. Teens ARE children as their brains are not fully developed until their early 20's, and are easily influenced by what they see. And this show is raw and base and violent in the extreme and in my opinion it is not for teenagers, even older teenagers.",1425168000,,878,4.353658536585366

Don't get me wrong; a certain episode in this season took me by surprise with its brutality, but this show is well made and just amazing. I never read the books before watching the show, but I had to read them after watching the first 3 episodes from season 1, and this show follows so closely to the books that it is impressive.

5704246,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"If you're looking at reviews of season three then it is inevitable that you're already captivated by this epic masterpiece of TV fantasy. We re-watched seasons one and two as a bit of essential preparative revision and have, as with previous seasons, watched this one twice back-to-back. A second viewing is essential, especially as we have a whole raft of new characters, to really get to enjoy the fiendish complexity of the interwoven narrative threads. Some very minor spoilers follow in the next paragraph

The seven kingdoms of Wersteros become ever more disparate as the civil war continues with Rob Stark leading the men of the North against the unspeakable King Joffrey while nobody is paying any attention to events north of the wall with Jon Snow as the Wildlings head south against the inexorable approach of winter and concomitant White Walkers. At the same time, Daenerys with attendant splendid dragons is trying to raise an army to help restore the Targaryen throne while Stannis licks his metaphorical wounds and falls further under the thrall of the red witch. That just covers the main story arcs. Add into that mix Aryas journey and the Brotherhood Without Banners, Jamie Lannister & Brienne and Brans very separate quests, the ascendancy Margaery Tyrell and, as ever, the irrepressibly brilliant Tyrion and the improbably likeable Varys hold Kings Landing together as things are not all sweetness and light in the house of Lannister.

There is just so much going on in so many places that it is impossible to grasp all of the subtleties even after a second viewing. Just for a change, there is a really useful Blu-ray special feature  the in episode guide allows you to see who is doing what where; really handy on the first viewing with so many new characters to keep track of.

With a lot of getting from A to B and a lack of set piece scenes, this season gives the feeling of getting all of the chess pieces in the right place ready for a tumultuous fourth season. Thats not to say, however, that there aren't more than a few surprises along the way. Well done, again, HBO  splendid stuff.",1421539200,2,2113,4.778082191780822

5704279,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I've always been a big fan of the lord of the rings. When the game of thrones came out, it looked really interesting. I'd read a lot of reviews saying how it was like the lord of the rings, only for adults.
I was never able to watch it, because I don't have cable.
One day, somebody was selling the first 3 seasons on dvd for really cheap. I jumped on the chance, and bought them from him.
I watched all 3 seasons in 4 days. (I had a few days off work)
Probably one of the best shows I've ever seen. It has everything an adult fan of the lord of the rings has, and so much more.
If you don't enjoy strong sexual content or graphic (sometimes disturbing) violence, then this isn't your type of show.",1421107200,,698,4.065217391304348

I don't subscribe to HBO so had to wait for the instant video release. Obviously, it would be impossible to squeeze in every little nuance found in the books, but, in a word?  Fabulous!  For anyone who might have been living under a rock and don't realize how very graphic the storylines are going to be, I would put out the caution that this adult material. Not for kids but what great entertainment for adults!  My only fear, at this point, is the Mr Martin will not get the next book completed in my lifetime!",1420243200,,621,4.245762711864407

5704434,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Incredible show, incredible production value, and an excellent cast. Season three veers off from the books in places but I think it actually does so in a positive way. The books have a tendency to go through long, looping storylines with throwaway characters (don't get me wrong, I love the books) whereas the show attempts (more so in season 3 than in previous seasons) to forge its own path, in some cases simplifying overcomplicated messes that G.R.R. Martin wrote himself into a corner with.

I see the show and the books as two separate and distinct things, and I enjoy both equally. Season three of the show really ramps up a lot of stuff that has been brewing so far, and I doubt anyone who has gotten this far into watching the show wouldn't love this season.

The blu-ray/DVD combo and digital copy are a great value; you can lend the DVD copy out to friends while keeping the blu-ray, and the digital copy allows you to download a copy onto iTunes while also having a copy on other streaming video services.",1419379200,,1017,4.582417582417582

5704772,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"I love A Song of Ice and Fire, but merely like the show. I know they have limited budgets, and multiple locations across the world, and make up and effects are expensive, but some scenes just are not as grand in scope as they are in the book, and those who are described as hideously disfigured merely have little scars. Also, it is a bit disconcerting how much older most of the characters are in the show. Children who are supposed to be 13 and 14 look like they are 18 or even 20. Gratuitous violence replaces the consequences of the actual violence described in the books. Some aspects of the book, particularly those that deal more directly with magic, were better left out or minimized. Personally I hope we do not see Lady Stoneheart in the show, and as little of her as possible in future books.",1416096000,,803,4.4324324324324325

5704845,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Extraordinary storyline and amazing characters. The meta message of this series like so many other great works of American cinema is the history of the battle of democracy against tyranny. This one, however, is just a bit more bloody and with more women and people who are savagely exploited. The savagery, is frankly, probably rather realistic of a time hundreds of years ago in real human history.
But this story includes magic. Dragons. Demons. Witches. No doubt is what people believed hundreds of years ago. So, in a manner of speaking this story has the ring of truth to it.

If you get Game of Thrones, you're already a slave to it and my review would just be preaching to the choir.

If you don't get GoT, what the hell are you looking at Season 3 for? It's not going to suddenly make you like the first two seasons!

Then again, if you don't like GoT, you're probably not very bright or you have very bad taste. I suggest you buy the ""According to Jim"" sets.",1413244800,,421,4.109756097560975

But it is brutal. Don't get too attached to a character because no one is safe. This is one of the things that makes the show so game changing. it doesn't follow the rules. It breaks them. All of them.

5705137,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"This is such a great series that my entire family is hooked. And that is saying something, as we all like to watch very different things. Game of Thrones is rather adult, definitely not for anyone under 18! But, for older families with everyone that is 18 and older, it's a great series to converse and theorize about. Who is your favorite character? What do you think will happen? Doesn't this character just frustrate you? They are questions usually only reserved for the rare family MOVIE outing. And it's constantly ongoing with every episode.",1411516800,,547,4.829787234042553

5705157,5,B00C8CQRQ4,I read this series years ago and was breathlessly awaiting the Dance with Dragons.  When I first heard about the HBO commitiment to the series I was impressed but dubious.  This is a gritty adult and often violent look at society and politics.  Probably exactly as early human history and interactions have been played out.  We in modern times tend to see the past through a lens of cleaner more wholesome society.  The attention to detail and the story is phenomenal.  The script follows the spirit and intent of the story without the details in the written work by GRRM.  A faithful and thoroughly entertaining production.,1411171200,2,624,4.830188679245283

The quality of the actually product is pretty nice though, it looks good in my collection and of course, using a nice TV and Blueray player, the show really comes to life.

For GoT fans, I'd say that season 3 is even better than 1 and 2. The show NEVER stops to amaze me. If you're a fellow fan, I don't think I need to tell you to buy it.",1410652800,,458,3.872340425531915

5705209,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Just amazing...you have to experience the Game of Thrones phenomenon yourself, even knowing the spoilers and what is to come does not dull the impact from this great show. The only ""negative"" I can think of are the sex scenes, as they sometimes get in the way of the story (to me) and make it kind of awkward to watch with friends/family, but I get why they are there, this show demonstrates the human element, so it brutally let's viewers see the heights of it's greatness and the depths of its wickedness. So, every aspect of what makes us human including our sexuality is explored and shown (graphically) but it does not feel exploitative to me. In other words, the disturbing violence and adult themes (incest, rape, murder, prostitution, etc) are not presented merely for shock value but to highlight how the characters respond to these injustices as the victims and as the perpetrators. Some might feel angered by certain characters dying ***SPOILERS***
i.e. Rob Stark, his wife, his mother, the Starks in general (not the luckiest bunch eh?)
but that is part of what makes this show brilliant, it plays with our expectations and serves as a deconstruction of the medieval fantasy genre. For example, I never thought I could ever, even for a moment root for a character like Jaime Lannister, that is, until what I say him face this season and last. Granted, I am not sure if the deconstruction aspects were intentional by the original author, he may have just wanted to write a great story but I can't tell you how many times I have been surprised with how expertly the show manages to show you that no one is truly good, they just have an agenda and rules they are comfortable with, some (the Lannisters) are more...ah hem...let's just say ""comfortable""...doing whatever it takes to further their power, whereas others limit themselves and the show genuinely shows what happens when the honorable face evil doers with clout. This doesn't diminish the beauty of trying to be an honorable person but merely realistically shows the consequences.",1410393600,5,2049,4.84045584045584

Some of the scenes were what I would call over done and just a bit too much for my taste, but, then I know I do have the option of simply turning it off.
The scenery is beautiful and the special effects are very well done.  The costumes and the different aspects of the show are stunning, so those are a true plus.

5705397,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"When I try to compare this to a REAL TV show that is CLASSIC with UNFORGETTABLE characters who DEVELOP, stories that are memorable, and LESSONS TO BE LEARNED such as Star Trek The Next Generation I can't believe I used to think this show was even ""good.""

I DON'T remember 1 episode that taught me a valuable life lesson.  Therefore to me it is GARBAGE, a waste of time, RANDOM ENTERTAINMENT at best.  And to me THE BEST movies, tv shows, and music make you think and connect and learn.  Game of Thrones DOES NOT do these things.

Yes there is drama, random entertainment and violence, and wonderful sets and costumes.  BUT at the end of the day it is a WASTE of time.  Don't believe me?  Try reading the book and I BET you won't finish the series and at some point wonder ""Why am I wasting my time reading this?""",1407196800,4,813,4.302631578947368

5705406,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"The HBO television series ""Game of Thrones"" is notorious for its gratuitous nudity and violence, and it does rest on the shoulders of a magnificent series of books by George Martin.  But the showrunners do deserve credit for a passionate commitment to storytelling, and while the dialogue can be melodramatic at times it is still sharp writing and wit.

In Season 3, we also see the television series achieving a life outside the books, and the characters themselves are achieving personalities that were not envisioned originally in the books.  This is both good and bad.  The Tyrells are portrayed and developed magnificently in the television series, achieving a rich layered complexity previously unseen in the books.  But the Starks are far more annoying and self-righteous that I had previously remembered in the books.",1407110400,2,825,5.172932330827067

5705464,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"This show is my favorite show on television.  If you haven't watched Game of Thrones, it is worth knowing it has some scenes of strong brutal violence as well as some scenes of sex and a fair amount of nudity.  However, that's not what the show revolves around by any means.  This show is very character driven; however, many main characters end up dying, and that's just something you'll have to get used to.  The book readers sometimes have their complaints about the show, but hey, let's face it:  books and tv/movies are different and have to be done differently.  I mean Harry Potter wasn't exactly true to the books every time, but I still love the movies.  So it is what it is, regardless of how close Game of Thrones truly follows the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" books by George RR Martin (I believe that's what they're called).  Anyways, I've been watching GOT from the first season, and I have loved every episode from the start.  I can't wait for the next season to come out, and I buy every season on DVD or BluRay as soon as they're available just to enjoy each full season at least one more time.  If you like excellent dialogue, cunning wit, hateful villains, questionable ""good guys"", peculiar motives, lots of shadiness and backstabbing, etc, all within a superbly acted and directed show of different people and groups all fighting for power within a realm of darkness and just the right amount of fantasy, then Game of Thrones is for you.  But do yourself a favor and start from the beginning so you know what the hell is going on, lol.

The instant streaming is more convenient than the DVDs I purchased for Seasons One and Two, but obviously lacks all the special features (low priority for me).

5705554,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"While this series seems promising with a brilliant cast of actors, it is unfortunately riddled with what amounts to pornography, extreme nudity, homosexuals have sex, and lesbians engaging in sex.  The plot and lines are beautifully played.  However, the series is not rated for viewing.  Therefore, if you are looking for a great series to share with friends and family, be forewarned that the nudity scenes last for several minutes and are not a passing glance.  The scenes are offensive, lasting in duration, and unacceptable for viewing.  It would have been a great series for all ages if it would have foregone the heavy amounts of nudity and soft porn.  It is a shame really because the cast is first rate actors and the scenery is excellent.  I would not recommend this series to anyone, especially people who have a higher moral character.  You can not keep up with the plot because you have to fast forward too many nudity/sex scenes.  We watched most of the first season, but as the sex scenes/nudity became worse and worse, we threw it in the trash.  We have returned the two other seasons unopened.",1405382400,5,1110,4.7643979057591626

5705556,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Excellent offering in its genre! Such great pains to be consistent in its authenticity, outrageous in its intrigue, and especially adept at portraying humanity and inhumanity.

In our culture, literature has traditionally spoiled us by catering to our natural need to identify the heroes and villains and reward and punish them, respectively. The Game of Thrones is probably closer to historical verity than we would wish it to be; But, dramatizing good and evil so effectively, might just help us learn some of the lessons our society should have taught us the hard way, over time,",1405382400,,582,5.0625

A bit peppered with sexy scenes visually and with sexism mostly while depicting marriages arranged and barracks attitudes changed barely upon millenniums, the Season 3 is, to a reviewer opinion, emphasized on individual's strong egolitarian urges as a moving force to developing a human society, which is a quite questionable assertion.

Whatever fictional paranormal things happened on the screen, a strong producers' conviction, that ancestors were physically stronger and needed near zero concealing to, is hard to quarrel with.

I don't want free music to stream, I want to pay 79$ for prime! I thought 79$ was too much! Amazon is has turned into walmart.  Anyone remember when super walmart first came out it was so clean and the people who worked there so educated and friendly?  Remember when they had a three customers in a line a new cash register will be opened policy?  Remember when walmart used to stock their shelves in the middle of the night instead of during the busiest time of the day?  Remember when made in America was their slogan?  Now that they drove all the mom and pop stores out of business look at walmart.  The stores are filthy, a lot of the people who work their look and act like they just got out of prison, the isles are always crammed with huge pallets to be stocked during the busiest times, and everything is Chinese.  Also, the prices aren't any better than anyone elses.  Walmart is a bully.  Amazon has gotten a little too big for it's britches and is getting just like walmart.  I find the prices better elsewhere and that makes up more than enough for shipping.  Plus, most online vendors give free shipping over 50$ anyway.  Good luck Amazon!

Lots of violence, sex, and stress, saying that, you either get very caught up in it, or you hate it.  My husband and I loved it.  My folks didn't, it was too much for them.

For that, you can always check out IMDB, which is where a review of the series belongs. Here I want to address the actual, physical DVDSthe things you purchased or are planning to purchase from Amazon. As others have noted, the DVDs are problematic. In my case, they did play, but took a long time to load, and often rebooted if I only played the first episode on the disc, then tried to play the second episode later. I suspect this has to do with some rather ill-advised attempts at copy protection, thus punishing the legitimate buyers while doing virtually nothing to stem piracy. Three stars because they did play, but no more considering the problems and lag time it took for them to do so.",1402272000,110,833,4.4868421052631575

5705792,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"I've read the books and decided to buy the TV Shows based on the reviews. I must say that I wasn't disappointed. The series is historically accurate, the quality of the DVD/Blu-ray discs very good. But want to make couple of points here:

1. The actual TV Shows are available only in DVD format and not blu-ray, at least, not in this selection. The blu-ray discs are additional material (loads of them) that are equally fascinating.
2. The Digital Copy DOES NOT work in many countries, including India, so it is actually a waste to procure one with a Digital Copy, that is till such archaic rules are removed by broadcasting companies. So legally you CANNOT download the Digital Copy if you reside outside of the US and a very few countries of Europe.
3. When I made this point with Amazon Customer Care that Amazon knew the contents and also the fact that I was shipping to India so they could very well have not shipped this collection with the Digital Copy. Amazon Customer Care agreed to make a partial refund of the total cost back to my credit card. That is one of the many reasons why shopping on Amazon is such a delightful experience.",1401667200,2,1143,4.521739130434782

5705796,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"The best T.V show of all times is clearly by far a Game of Thrones.

It has all the action that you need, beautiful women and it is set in a fantasy world where your imagination can go wild.
The action consists of battles for the throne, Dragons flying about and swords constantly clashing. It shows the blood and all the gore making it that much better. Just in the first few episodes alone the George R. R. Martin whom is the writer captivates your imagination and will have you feeling as if you are directly in the fight. The Characters are so well played that it is inspiring to the imagination, has you thinking about the possibilities.
 The main reason I kept watching the show was seeing how beautiful the princess and the queens where. I know that they have professional make up artist and the lighting is modified so that they look their best, but even with all of the enhancers their beauty still keeps me interested.
 Now the setting is in a fantasy world but it also has a hint of medieval times. Everybody once in their lives has dreamed about ruling their own castle, leading men in battle with swords and shields instead of guns like in todays world. Well this shows makes you feel a bit closer to that dream. Now if you aren't into these types of shows I suggest you watch it and see if you don't change your mind.

Game of  Thrones will satisfy all your T.V watching craving needs with its beauty, blood and gore and the setting will make you a king.",1401494400,4,1468,4.382352941176471

The plot takes a long time to develop, but I like this because the acting and character development are both very good.

This series is well written, well acted and the costumes and special effects are first rate, you gain an appreciation of characters you may not have liked or considered before, their motives and aspirations.  I don't really care to say much about what happens this season, best you watch it yourself and enjoy it...don't be tempted to skip around, watch it in the order it was meant to be watched.

Although it is a mythical world there are many parallels with medieval times (not including the dragons).  Kingship is not an easy matter as History will attest, and the nature of the viperous charactrers keeps you watrching and hungry for more.

I don't have HBO so I actually did purchase all three seasons on blu ray and besides the fact that the show is amazing, I've found myself more than once going back to an episode from the season before. There's a huge amount of speaking parts and they keep adding more with each new episode (OK, they eliminate many characters via sword and ax and knife so I guess it may come out even) and with the blu rays from each season they include a little cheat sheet which explains (if you need it) who these new characters are and where they fit into the genealogy of the story so far. And believe me, to follow the genealogy of these families you will need a cheat sheet. If you're offended by bloodshed or nudity or extreme violence (oh Theon, I was jealous of you those first two seasons!) then take a pass. But if you crave some excellent writing and acting, great action sequences, sword fights, lots of blood, sex and nudity, dragons, an epic story, numerous twists and turns and a story that hasn't slowed down once in 30 episode (that I've seen so far), you have to check out GoT!",1400544000,,1186,4.322869955156951

No GOT has dialogue that is ripe with angry green bottleneck flies buzzing away at it s1lickly sweet and odor, and bursting at its fruit sack with steamy sex. (Implied of course this is HBO. . . albeit graphically explicit. There I warned you!) Hold fast for the more the episodes come, ahem, the more visually interesting it will be for those multitude of popcorn movie lovers who just want to see the 'Monsters!'.

5705880,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I will keep my comments brief and the reveiw to the physical product rahter than the merits of the show itself.  I think there has been enough debate (with good points on both sides. . . Pro: original story, great acting, gritty realism.  Con: derivitive, excessively gory/sexual, few fantasy elements) as to the quality and validity of GoT.  I have enjoyed the series, and this season was no exception.

The combo DVD, Blu-Ray and digital copy set comes in a nice compact package with a cool plastic slipcover.  The presentation is nice, and the two sets of discs are in separate folders within the box itself.  The Blu-Ray disc folder is much larger than the one for the DVDs, but I like that the separate folders allows for easy lending of one set while you watch the other yourself.

I have not used the digital copy at all yet, and I may never, but I have downloaded digital copy from teh same company previously without any difficulty.

For the price, this set is a wondwerful way to add the Third Season of GoT to your collection.  I do not have HBO, and I have been watching them on disc, so this is going next to the other sets in my video collection.

Chances are that you are not new to GoT if you are looking at the Season Three set, but if you are. . . go back and watch 1 and 2 or you won't know who anybody is or why you should care.",1400025600,,1348,4.250980392156863

5705897,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I was prepared to dislike this because I am not into fantasy, probably why I never read the books. However I was amazed at how it grabs you jerks you into the story. At times funny, at times very brutal and violent, and at other times shocking. I would not recommend this for children under 13, especially so for sensitive children.

5705911,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"""Game Of Thrones"" is such a spectacular series!  This is a keeper!  I watch this over again every month.  I like the fact that the design on the storage case is different with each series.  I would prefer all the series' DVDs be stored in one box such as the ""Harry Potter"" series.  I'm sure they will eventually do this.  It is so much easier to store and all the DVDs are together.  Love it!!!",1399593600,,395,4.1866666666666665
5705912,2,B00C8CQRQ4,"Please feel free to read my previous review on the Game of Thrones Season 1-2 boxed set for the full review experience. I'm going to just keep this short and sweet.

The books are great, as I've said in my previous review. The series is, so far, leaving a lot to be desired. While it is entertianing it's not living up to all the hype for me.

The characters are not really following or breaking completely away from their stories in the books. Some characters are completely missing (Strong Belwas being the most notable in the third season). All of Dany's handmaidens are dead in the TV series. In the books they are her most loyal and trusted advisors. As such I'm a bit shocked and very sad that the seris is breaking so far away from the books. The third season is the worst about this so far. The Red Lady shows up in Westeros to visit Thoris of Mir and Barrick Dundarian which never happened in the books and as such makes zero sense in the series. It's becoming almost a bit absurd.

I really hope the show can pull together and redeem itself.",1399593600,3,1051,4.3520408163265305

But I am not of the strongest constitution when it comes to blood and gore.  I just don't enjoy watching impalings, beheadings, heads on stakes, other body parts being chopped off, beatings, etc.  So, I end up closing my eyes a lot.  I also have never watched a show that has as much nudity as this show.  There's so much of it, I don't even really notice it anymore (LOL).  The bloodiness factor is the only reason I don't go up to five stars.

I have read the books and my wife has not so while I can't help but fuss a bit when the show deviates from the books, she really enjoyed each episode. Of course I was waiting to see her reaction to the last episode and the shocking event. Game of Thrones continues to deliver good drama. Those fussing about the sex and violence ought to remember that this is fiction, but if you look at our own history, it is bloody, violent, and women were treated basically the way they are portrayed in this show.

Definitely not family entertainment as it contains violence, rape, torture and sex so put the kiddies to bed before you jump into it. Start from the beginning of the first season and work you way to season 3.  Jumping into the middle will not be as much fun, you will miss vital story connections and it will not make as much sense because there are several related story lines unfolding simultaneously.

5705968,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Granted you can watch all the episodes if you have HBO GO along with your service provider subscription and save yourself $45. But I personally love to purchase the Blu-Ray sets for the series because each final disc in every season comes with special features that go further in depth into the mythology of its world. It provides background stories and history to characters and their houses, locations and events that are only briefly mentioned in the episodes which may sometimes leave you scratching your head wondering what the characters are even talking about or what it has to do with the setting at hand. All that is further explained in those special features so you never feel lost on who's who and what's what. If you are the kind of viewer who appreciates the show for what it is or just the Fantasy Epic genre in general, I highly recommend you purchase the Blu-Ray sets.",1398902400,,885,4.67948717948718

Kind of crappy to have a boxed disk set and 2 of the 5 are scratched and limit the watching of them.
BEWARE CHECK THE DISKS AS SOON AS YOU GET THE SET!!

5706008,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Certainly this season was heartrenching. I did question season 2's departure from the book re Robb and his wife and now I know why. In the book, he broke his oath because of honor and in the show he broke his oath because of love - both leading to the same tragic consequence. I read an opinion piece bemoaning this change, as though the show ruined Robb's character by making his impulsivity emotional rather than about he and his father's shared tragic flaw of being too honorable for the world around them. Oh, but when it came time for the wedding sequence - one cannot deny the power of four-fold doom.

Oh, that scene, that scene! My heart broke seeing the anguish then devastation on Catelyn Stark's face - it has been seared in my mind.

As for other characters - hot dang, I can't believe I now feel sympathy for the person who pushed Bran off the tower. Can anyone evil be redeemed? What Jaime and Theon went through this season was deserved --- and yet it gives me hope that evil can be excised from a person and what is left will only be the good.",1398470400,15,1059,4.343434343434343

5706016,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of Thrones is an exceptionally popular and critically-acclaimed show. If you're considering purchasing season 3 I have to assume you know about the show so I'm not going to go into those details. I'm primarily going to focus on the Bluray release itself.

The third season of Game of Thrones is packaged almost identically to the previous bluray releases. Five bluray discs are interspersed throughout folding case that fits within a hard slipcase. A plastic slipcover goes over these to create the dragon shadow effect. A smaller slip case that fits within the hard slipcover holds the double-sided DVD versions of the show as well as the digital copy code. In terms of packaging it is frankly exquisite. The only comments I want to make with regards to this are:

1. I consider having the DVDs included as kind of a bonus, but the double sided nature of the discs as well as the slip case you store them in creates a perfect storm to scratch or damage the DVDs. Handle them with care.

2. The DVD release is 5 discs, the bluray release is also 5 discs. With bluray discs able to hold so much more information I'm kind of at a loss as to why so many discs are needed. I wish it were fewer discs so that they wouldn't have to be changed as frequently as the DVDs do.

3. As I stated previously, the packaging is gorgeous, but it's also a little bulky. I wish it were a little slimmer so it took up a little less space but the seasons do look pretty awesome on my media rack.

4. The digital copy is an amazing feature to this collection. Note: it can doesn't just have to be redeemed on iTunes, it can also be redeemed on Ultraviolet services too such as Vudu.",1398384000,,1665,4.392857142857143

Blu-ray, DVD, digital combo packs are becoming commonplace and I for one think it's fantastic. This is a lovely edition to any movie collection  and looks fantastic on the shelf. As with the first and second seasons- the packaging fits theme and is well designed for style and function. Blu-ray is the perfect format to showcase the incredible work and attention to detail that has been invested in the series by all involved in the production. I haven't yet utilized my digital copy, but the compact and simple way the DVD version is packaged in it's own slip-case provides great portability but also protection for the disks. I've found myself much more amendable to the idea of loaning out a season to a friend since I don't have to part with my precious Blu-ray boxed set.

5706045,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"HBO has killed this story by adding elements to the screen that simply weren't part of the books.  Face it world.  Women are treated extremely poorly in Game of Thrones.  It is no excuse to say that everyone is treated poorly in Game of Thrones.  It really isn't.

Queen Cersi's rape by her brother is a case in point.  It didn't happen in the book because he wasn't there at that time.  There was no need for it, artistically speaking.  The moment, understandably, upset plenty of fans of the show and books, for which Martin apologized: ""The scene was always intended to be disturbing,"" he wrote, ""but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.""

Wrong reasons?????  He obviously believes that there are right reasons for rape to be portrayed on the TV????

Game of Thrones could have been something great.  Instead, HBO has simply ruined it.  Game of Thrones is misogynist and gynophobic at best.  It really shows where HBO's heads are at.

There are things that happen in this series that are just jawdropping! The huge number of characters allow a lot of scope to surprise the audience with who gets killed off and who rises to the occasion. Personally I am less interested in what happens north of the wall and that element put me off reading beyond the first book. Fortunately, the bulk of the stories here are concerned with the more gritty dealings between the contenders for the throne. Being unfamiliar with the books, means that virtually everything in the TV series is new to me  confrontingly so at times. It continues to be a superbly produced show. Things look as they should, whether its a grand castle vista or a brutal killing. The violence is very strong but that is the key to this show. Mistakes and losing a fight are punished ruthlessly, some things really make you shudder. The stakes are as high as they can get.

I've barely kept track of all the characters and families. That said, I've become thoroughly engrossed in this series. And Season 3 is probably the best season yet. The richness of the world portrayed in the first two seasons allows the story to expand in multiple directions, with a pay-off that no two-hour movie could match. You don't have to love dragons and magic to become enamored of this TV show. If you appreciate great stories, multi-dimensional characters, timeless (and modern) themes, and superb acting, you will most likely enjoy this show.",1397865600,,699,4.785123966942149

The story itself is so arresting that you are hooked before the first episode is half finished.  You care about these characters, even the ones you love to hate (do you hear that, Joffrey?), and that only enhances the excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  There is a huge surprise in this season, and it doesn't come at the end of the final episode, so be careful as you watch because you will be caught off-guard and you WILL want to see it again.  The clarity of the pictures and the quality of the sound are exemplary throughout the season, and the special effects are dazzling; you will be amazed.  There is nothing here that I didn't like, and this season deserves six stars if only Amazon would allow that many.  Stop reading and click 'add to cart.'

5706094,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"HBO SHOULD develop a new theme  something along the lines of Nobody does it better. Because no other network excels at producing epic stories or high-definition releases like this cable network. We previewed its potential with series like Rome and Deadwood, but Game of Thrones consistently sets standards others don't come close to.

Episode One opens with Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), a survivor of Season Twos Battle of Kings Landing, stranded on a barren rock. Blistered and ragged, we can know hes been there some time. As he waves for help from a distant ship, nothing could look more realistic  unless it was possible to step into the scene ourselves like the legendary Holodeck of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

That scene  and all the rest of the dynamic third season  look and sound so authentic on this 1080p and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track, the only thing better is being there ...

Except Westeros isn't the healthiest world to visit. Even those who have never seen the series or read author/executive producer George R.R. Martins A Song of Fire and Ice, know about the Red Wedding. Its a scene from episode 9, The Rains of Castamere, and has become a classic TV moment. (I was one of the readers wondering if the Red Wedding and its aftermath would make it to film. It actually surpassed my expectations.)

The general plot isn't as complicated as youd think. Everything revolves around a bitter civil war over who will sit on the Iron Throne and rule the previously united Seven Kingdoms. This fantasy medieval world has known a long period of prosperity, but corruption and a sadistic young king have the realm engaging in full-out carnage, betrayal, espionage, torture and assassination. Game of Thrones appeal comes in the fully realized characters and their actions; we need to know what will happen next.

All this is thanks to series co-creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who fell in love with Martins books. Their attention to detail, staying true to the source material, writing, directing and casting has turned the show into a masterwork. Although it never would've happened without a network willing to take a millions-of-dollars risk to put it on air. Theres now talk of making a film for theatrical release.

Major kudos also go to HBO for the terrific batch of bonus features provided on the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital package. There are hours of extras loaded on the five Blu-ray discs. Every episode has an in-episode guide, allowing viewers to access background characters, location and historical info. All episodes, except the first, have a commentary and, in some cases, two. Speakers include actors, writers and directors. Some rely on fun, such Kissed by Fire, with Nikolaj Coster Waldau (Jaime Lannister), Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth) and writer Bryan Cogman. Others are more serious and informative, such as The Bear and the Maiden Fair with Martin and director Michelle MacLaren.

My favorite was The Rains of Castamere with Richard Madden (Robb Stark), Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark) and director David Nutter. Nutter talks about a website with more than 9-million hits on the episode. Fairley had never seen it before, saying she was too scared to watch it. Both Fairley and Madden are weeping by the end.

Other bonus features include a more detailed look at Rains, and short featurettes: A Gathering Storm, recapping Season 2; New Characters; The Politics of Marriage, and Inside the Wildings, a closer look at the Northerners being chased south by the White Walkers  another mainland conflict-to-be, I reckon. Also find a handful of outstanding deleted and extended scenes, the best featuring Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance).

I missed the Round Table discussions with Benioff, Weiss, and the actors as found on the Season 1 and 2 presentations, but its easy to see how they were kind of busy. (Exhausted and injured, too. Kit Harrington (Jon Snow) broke his ankle; many of his running scenes were played by a body double; some were rewritten so he could sit.)

Maybe theyll be able to catch their breath for by the time Season 4 comes out on disc - but I doubt it.   Kay Reynolds",1397779200,3,4153,4.96969696969697

Season 2 draws you back into the lives of the characters and you either love them more or loathe their [fictional] existence more than one thought possible..for fictional characters of course (I have to remind myself of that). Season 3 is good, but truly a mental and emotional roller-coaster. I found myself conflicted about the treatment of one character who, at first, I thought deserves the treatment he's getting and by the end he's the one person (besides Joffrey, for obvious reasons) I WANT to die just so he can be put out of his misery. This season steps up the development and personality of characters a dozen notches.

But Wow, just WOW.

In addition to the great show, I love all the commentary which gives you background that you don't get watching on HBO.
The best audio commentary comes from the writers, directors, and producers.

The other extras/features explaining the story background, the characters, the ""lands"", the relationships,  really helps me understand the show.
You only get those on the DVD or Blu-ray set.",1397433600,2,464,4.923076923076923

5706148,5,B00C8CQRQ4,This HBO Show has yet to disappoint me. It had such a strong start and the momentum has just continued. Every season has been as good as the first for me & I can't wait to purchase season 4 when it comes out.,1397433600,,208,3.86046511627907
5706149,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"if by now you aren't on board the GoT train, then you have a lot of catching up to do.  But a thirty hour marathon of watching this show now is really a bit much.... I advise a season a day with a nice break in between.  However, it's terribly addictive, and the onslaught continues in terms of sex, violence, power struggles and so on.  Hell, even the costumes rock.

HBO never backs down from portraying borderline questionable themes and scenes with a gritty reality that will make you sit up and gasp at a few of the scenes.  It's got its hooks in me like crystal meth.... can't stop this thing we've started....

Deviation from the books continues but is always done both with GRRM's awareness and involvement.  He's got a close relationship with the writers and they are keeping true to the TONE and FLAVOUR of the books even where they make changes to the action or timeline.  Ultimately the result still serves to bring you forward right where you're supposed to be.

At this point I've stopped reading the books looking for explanations of things and I am taking the series at face value.  It's that good.  When I go back to the books again later they will dovetail with the show much more logically I am sure.

There is a new packaging design for the third season, it still matches but it's got this translucent plastic slipcase instead of the cardboard one.  My OCD wishes it matched identically, but hey.... as long as it's not a big difference I'll be ok.

Same 5 discs with 10 episodes as prior seasons.  Still putting fun features on each disc instead of a features disc separately.

If you're reading my review, you want to be convinced to buy it.  So go buy it already.  You won't be sorry.  The only reason not to get DVD is if you get Blu-Ray.  Otherwise it's a gem.  I just wish I could buy season four already.... the wait is gonna kill me.....",1397347200,20,1865,4.426470588235294
5706150,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love this show...it's hands down probably one of my favorites. In fact I love it so much that I even pre-ordered season 3 the second I was able...and I got the dvd set finally in about err...feb?

Well because my life as a student was hectic and busy at the time the dvd set was left unopened and still sealed on my shelf, so I finally open it a couple of months later...tonight basically (and way past the return policy deadline might I add...yes I know it's my own stupid fault for not checking but still...) So, I open it to check out my dvds and my dvd sets packaging design and I'm literally like WTF...there's seriously a disc missing...DISC 4 IS MISSING!!! JUST GONE!!!! AND I JUST OPENED IT!!! IT WAS SERIOUSLY SEALED 2 MINS AGO!!!! I've never EVER EVER had a problem pre-ordering this series or anything from Amazon before in my life (and trust me I order and pre-order a lot of crap off here lol) but this...this is absolutely ridiculous...I'm incredibly disappointed at Amazon, HBO, or whoever is in charge of shipping these dvds out...it's an absolute joke Amazon! A joke! YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED! My only wish was of course that I had checked the dvds right when I first got them...whelp guess that's what I get for putting my trust in Amazon who I thought was a company who would never let me down...I mean it just sucks cause when you purchase something you just automatically assume...especially if you have pre-ordered it to get what you've paid for...obviously this is not the case here!

My only suggestion is BUYER BEWARE!!! And don't make the same mistake I did...always check to make sure what you paid for is actually in the box. -.-""

(Also, as a side note after this I am never ever pre-ordering dvd's or anything from this site again...sorry Amazon you've totally lost my trust here...because quite frankly a missing disc is kind of a big deal...and not to mention complete BS!!! I'd be better off pre-ordering elsewhere or from some offline store...)",1397347200,4,2018,4.6
5706151,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"Season 3 does not cover as much ground as the first two.  The plots are not quite as thick and it just doesn't grab you quite like the first and second seasons.  Without giving away the story, lets just say that many of the avenues that were well developed and kept my interest were ended without developing many new things to replace them.

5706205,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I am a big fan of great fantasy writing.  Tolkein was the best.  Peter Jackson richly deserved the academy awards for best director and best picture that he won for The Return of the King.  Since Tolkein, only Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin approached his creative genius.  However they could not complete their stories and just got caught up in logorrhea.  Jordan was silenced by death and Martin by a paralyzing case of writer's block  However the early books of both writers were amazing and showed great promise. Too bad the Wheel of Time and the Song or Fire and Ice sagas will never be completed by the original geniuses who created them.  The HBO adaptation of the first books of the Fire and Ice saga are great.  The actors are superb, and the director is doiing a monumental job..",1397088000,,795,4.588652482269503

5706242,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"First, let's address this is a rating on the show, and not HBO. If you don't have a cable TV subscription + $20 or more for HBO, their policy for us common people is F U. This is season 3 which was purchased in 2014 - a couple of months before season 4 comes out. Would I be buying Season 4, very likely. However, I will have to wait almost a year.

With that being said, this is a good show. It is obviously not appropriate for younger viewers as there is a good deal of nudity, sexual content, and of course violence.",1396828800,,519,4.038834951456311

The scenery is fabulous. The acting is wonderful. The story is extremely entertaining. Maybe it is because the author is helping with the movie's direction.. maybe it is because of the set of talented people that have come together to create this masterpiece. I usually have read the books before seeing movies. This time I am watching the movies first because they are so spectacular. I've started reading the books and am surprised that the movie does not disappoint (like it usually does leaving off important things - ie the Jurassic park movie, what a great book and the movie was disappointing to me with so much left off ).

I love the fact that no characters are safe in this show, the unpredictability, and the good writing for each of the myriad plot lines.

5706278,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"WELL, WELL, WELL I don't even know where to start, OK let me start of by saying I'm not big on giving away a lot of details and storyline SO you're not going to see that here as I want everyone to enjoy the show for what it is and how I experienced it. I was turned on to this show by a friend and in turn I've turned about 10 people on to this show and I hope many more after this and other reviews, and trust me this is the one time you want to walk into a show blind because it will be surprise after surprise and the best past of this show is they kill off lead characters and this is what makes this show so great because this is how it happens in the real world and at the end of the day if more shows did this not just when someone wants off the show they would find that YES the viewers will be upset for awhile but in the end it makes it a better show. At the end of the day this is by far one of the best DRAMAS EVER!!!HBO you did this. The show has only one flaw and thats that stupid 10 episodes per season thing that the network is now doing, in the 90's they gave you about 18-20 shows per season then in the early 2000's that dropped to 14-16 then it went to 12 and now it's down to 10...stop being so greedy HBO!!! This is how you kill a great show!",1396656000,,1265,3.7593984962406015

5706288,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Episode 4 of this season was amazing, and the next season of this show will be a great ending for readers of A Storm of Swords.  The events of this season were great aside from the Red Wedding, that is something I'll be fine with never seeing again.",1396569600,,249,4.1875

5706290,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I am totally in love with Game of Thrones; I read all five books and felt depressed when I finished the last one, nothing I read these days comes even close to this series. Maybe Diana Gabaldon and her Outlander series is a close second, who could not love the story of Jamie and Claire.
Now that I am watching the HBO presentation of Game of Thrones, I am in love all over again. Who would have thought that a TV series could so capture the books, but it does to a T...........I am loving Season 3 as much as I did Season 1 and 2........I feel like I live in the story, I never want it to end..........thank you.",1396569600,,613,4.116666666666666
5706291,5,B00C8CQRQ4,Probably the best season yet. You watch several plot lines and plans start coming together only to have them all ripped apart towards the end when everything changes. Again. Several new characters and new plot lines are introduced as well.,1396569600,,239,5.0

5706300,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"Fantastic as a follow up to Season 2; however, not as good as Season's One and not as good as Season's Two's follow up.

5706307,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Wow! This season rocks! It's not just because they picked up the pace/action. They also fleshed out the characters by giving them back story and showing their motivations. My impression of the first season was, ""All these people are despicable. Who cares what they do?"" Not now! They have hearts, feelings, and are more like real people. Even if you don't like them, you can now understand them and see that they have the same feelings (in some ways) as you. The writers weren't afraid to cut, cut, cut. In a heartbeat, the story makes a quick turn and, like a rollercoaster, you are speeding off to the unknown. Where the ends is a far cry from where it started. Enjoy the ride.

The producers David Benioff and D.B.Weiss are doing a great keeping everyone on track and staying with the story line, that the author George R.R. Martin so wonderfully wrote. Its so wonderfully wrote and  enjoyable to watch. The director is going a great job putting the movie together. I can't wait for season 4.",1396396800,,478,4.558139534883721

5706315,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"We enjoyed this enough to ""binge watch "" it from season 1 through this one. Having read the books previously, I was worried that the adaptaion to screen would exclude some details and scenes that I consider important to the overall story. I need not have worried about that. They didn't miss a thing that I thought of as important.
I was equally concerned about the actors, sometimes a big production skimps on acting in order to pay for special effects, this did not happen either. Performances acheve the quality I had hoped for.
I am not an HBO subscriber, so I am going to have to wait for season 4 as I did for this one. I am eagerly awaiting the day when I can add it to the set.",1396396800,,685,4.236641221374046

But damn, every time the momentum was going for someone I liked they killed them off.  I was in so much turmoil over the second to last episode in season 3 - they take you up and then drop you from 1000 feet. Love the show but I'm pretty sure they are enjoying watching their fans on this emotional rollercoaster.",1396396800,,459,4.0777777777777775

Chances are if you buy the Blu Ray, you already are a fan, so I won't review the show. The quality of this set is worth the price. We like to watch all the seasons before the new one starts, and this is the way to do it.",1396396800,,479,4.150537634408602

It was a nice set that includes the map and houses, etc, but I paid $45 for it. I could not wait for the second season so I returned to Wal-Mart to purchase seasons 2 and 3 and they were $45 each as well as only DVD versions. So I checked Amazon and saw that both seasons were available for $35 each and each boxed set includes both DVD and Blu Ray versions as well as digital copies so I bought them both in the spot. Waited only two days and then they were here. They are both nicely packaged and include maps of Westeros, as well as character's family trees and houses. They also come with nice durable sleeves that I am sure will stand up to time and handling. I would definitely recommend both sets to anyone who enjoys a good and exciting drama series and anyone who is a collector of the G.O.T. brand.",1396396800,,953,4.129032258064516

5706345,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"""Game of Thrones"" is a fantasy series aired on HBO, based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novels ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". The plot is set in the fictitious lands of Westeros and Essos, where a power struggle for the Iron Throne rages between different noble houses after the murder of the old king. This DVD contains the episodes of the third season, and is notable for the episode ""The Rains of Castamere"", in which several of the main characters are brutally slain, disregarding every conventional idea about how TV should be made. But then, we've seen it before...in ""Lost"".

I admit that I'm not an engaged super-fan of ""Game of Thrones"", but like most people, I nevertheless find myself watching every episode. Why? No idea, really. As I said in my review of Season Two, this is simply a remake of the European Early Middle Ages, with some Roman and ""Oriental"" spices thrown in. In contrast to most fantasy, Martin's story has very little supernatural flavour, and the whole plot feels just as meaningless as medieval history. We're talking blood feuds, civil wars, arranged marriages, orgies, strange new religions frequently even worse than the old ones... Europe around AD 600?

Ironically, it could be the incredibly complex plot (or rather parallel plots) which makes the trick. That, and the colourful characters, makes it difficult not to find *something* of interest. A bit like a Swedish smorgasbord, I suppose? And yes, many viewers love the nudity or pretend to abhor the violence...

Personally, I found the unapologetic, politically incorrect Orientalism of the Daenerys Targaryen subplot a real guilty pleasure. A blond, Nordic valkyrie liberating Black slaves and challenging effeminate and vile ""Semites""... I'm surprised nobody started a culture war over this? Instead, people pretended to be upset when mad king Joffrey turned out to be a homophobe. LOL! Oh, and yes, the strange new religion of the Red Priestess is really an allegory for Christianity, not Zoroastrianism. But please don't tell anyone, because that could *really* start something...

I will probably watch the fourth season of ""Game of Thrones"", whenever Swedish public service TV sees fit to show it. Next year?

Well, this third season of the popular adaptation of the books has the usual ingredients. To be honest I'd give this an extra star if it didn't - it all seems so gratuitous. I can understand the titilation aspect for a first series but now that the story has advanced and indeed is gripping I really can't see the need for more and more sex.
That being said, the production values are high, the acting good and the story excellent.

5706374,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"A Game of Thrones was a brilliant book with great characters, action, and excitement.  Season 1 of the show was equally brilliant.

A Clash of Kings started out slowly but crescendoed to an exhilarating climax.  Season 2 of the show followed a similar arch.

I'm mystified as to how A Storm of Swords, arguably the strongest source material yet, could produce television as dull and scattered as the first two-thirds of Season 3 of 'Game of Thrones'.

Similar to Season 2, which ended with a pair of highly focused and engaging episodes, Season 3 offers up a trio of incredibly strong shows to close things out.  The problem is the first 7 episodes which could have, and should have, been condensed down to 2 or 3.  It's not that ""nothing happens,"" as has been argued by the shows critics and disputed by its sycophants, just that nothing compelling happens for the first 90% of each viewing.

Ask any fan of the show to recount for you the memorable moments which occur in Season 3 and you'll undoubtedly get responses similar to the following (no spoilers):

Locke helps Jaime remember (Episode 3, 50:25)
Craster mouths off to Mormont (Episode 4, 36:29)
Dany makes a deal (Episode 4, 46:40)
Littlefinger's monologue (Episode 6, 46:15)
Jaime turns back (Episode 7, 50:08)
Sam becomes a man (Episode 8, 52:15)
Black Walder closes the doors (Episode 9, 41:56)

Ask that same person to recount anything memorable which actually occurred in the first half an episode: we've basically got the trial which opens episode 5 and the awkward ceremony that occurs 15 minutes into episode 8.  The rest is oft-boring dialogue which does nothing to enhance the show's infrequent memorable moments.

Good episodic television is made up of acts which provide exposition, introduce new characters/plotlines, or advance existing plotlines.  Whatever its purpose, a good act of episodic television accomplishes its goal in a compelling manner.

Soap operas are made up of numerous characters involved in many storylines, each of which is advanced only a few minutes at a time with little-to-no relation to any of the other ongoing storylines.  They are trite, boring, manipulative, and formulaic.

Note to Benihoff and Weiss: Please stop producing a medieval soap opera and get back to the brilliant episodic television your series once was (also, it's OK for something interesting to happen in the first 40 minutes of an episode, and for a good episode to be placed in the first half of a season).

Unfortunately, the commentaries (my primary driver in purchasing the Blu-rays) are equally as dreadful and uninspired as the rest of this season.  Allow me to summarize all 12 for you:

""These opening credits are amazing - have you noticed how they change from week-to-week?""
""Jack Gleeson is so sweet, nothing at all like Joffrey.  Did you know he plans to quit acting to become a philosopher?""
""Oh, I just love (whoever is on screen at that moment) - he/she is brilliant.""
""The sets are brilliant.""
""The costumes are brilliant.""
""This music is brilliant.""
""These child actors are brilliant.""
""David and Dan are brilliant.""
""These scenes are just so brilliant I don't want to talk over them.""
""Have you actually read the books?""
""Was this shot in Croatia or Ireland?""
""Did you know they painted the Titanic here?""
""Did I mention that Jack Gleeson wants to quit acting to become a philosopher?""

I'm not sure whether the show runners made a mistake by deciding to divide this book across 2 seasons of the show, but I am certain they are doing an absolutely dreadful job of it.  This Blu-ray set is comprised of 5 episodes worth of actual content excruciatingly (and completely unnecessarily) stretched across 10 installments, complemented by a host of weak and equally boring commentary tracks.  Episodes 8-10, along with sporadic scenes from 1-7, get 5 stars.  The remainder of episodes 1-7 get 2 stars, and the lackluster bonus features get 2 stars.  The net result is a 3 star rating, which feels generous given the massive head start provided by the source material.",1396137600,12,4052,4.923529411764706

There are very few series that really hook me in all the way through but so far this one has me looking forward to future episodes.,1396137600,,396,4.197368421052632
5706388,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Its just an incredible show, the Blu-ray is easily a 5 out of 5. I would however like to address the fact that the only difference between this Edition and the regular Blu-ray/DVD combo pack is the 'statue'. Which while cool is completely hollow, it serves as a large Blu-ray sleeve. As such most of the thing just sits on a pedestal with square pegs sitting in square slots, it is NOT a solid structure. While these are serviceable to hold the tombstone-esk piece on to the base, I have notice the solid dragon statue attached to the thing makes it droop forward when displayed without the Blu-ray box inside it, so be aware that it may fall forward of its base without the season (or an equally large Blu-ray set) inside it. So if you're like me and want to display the statue somewhere other than the the DVD season that's something to keep in mind. Other than that I love it, but depending on the price point your enjoyment of the total set may vary.  I do however highly recommend the show itself as reflected in my score, its just the display case you should maybe be dubious of.

Also just FYI the Dragon on display is Dracarys, his name is emblazoned on the back of the structure. Thought fans of the books/show might want to know.",1396137600,,1239,4.406113537117904
5706389,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Just finished up season 3 and highly enjoyed the episodes.  One major complaint I have with this series is that they feature Lena Headey & her evil son King Jofferey way too much, taking away screen time from the other characters.  The character of Tywin Lanister is explained more, especially his twisted relationship with his children including the Dwarf character who is one of the only good guys on this show. The exploits of the Dragon Queen Kolisie are excellent, and as far as I am concerned she is the only main character I really care about through out this entire series.

 What I would like from this series is a bit more action and combat, a little less ploting and drama.  Other very interesting characters such as the black Pirate are hardly featured, in favor of other plot movers.  The non heroic, but never the less other good guy (besides the Dwarf, and Kolisie) is the heavy set young man from the Knight's Watch who find's himself surviving in this violent and dark sadistic medieval world where brutality is the norm.  With many grey characters, this show is very original and a simular concept seems to have only been touched upon before with movies such as ""Braveheart"" with Mel Gibson, and the early 80's with ""Excalibur"".  My hat's off to the author of this series, for creating very detailed and original work.  In my mind this entire show is a fantasy depiction of the violent real history of medieval Europe, set in a ""Dungeons & Dragons"" background.

 What I would like to see is the plot, and characters move along at a faster pace.  Especially the Dragon Queen Kolisie.  It seems it takes forever for these characters to get anywhere.  Another issue I have is there are just way too many characters to follow.  The warfare regarding Kolisie's newly obtained army, and her dragons needs to be focused on.

 Films like the ""300"" series, which are equally fantastic, have way too much focus on the fighting, while this show is the complete opposite.  Over all this is light years ahead of the childish, ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Hobbit"" series.  Can't wait for season 4.",1396137600,2,2098,4.683060109289618

Im happy to say that  ALL the DVDs worked !  Thank you !
So many DVDs have such horrible copyright protection on them that they just won't play. (I've had trouble with some showtime and sony disks in particular)  These GOT disks - no problem.

5706440,5,B00C8CQRQ4,I could watch this again and again. The story is captivating and the characters are so humanly flawed and it's difficult to look away. I can't wait for an ending...it seems no one ever lives.,1395878400,,191,4.485714285714286

5706450,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"In general, I've been really impressed with the quality and the extras of the Game of Thrones Blu-Ray series. I like having the multiple options for digital copies. I don't have much use for the extra DVD copies at present, but they take little space in the overall packaging.

With a story and a world as complex as this one, HBO uses Blu Ray to great effect with the in-episode guides which give information about the characters in the scene, where the scene is taking place. Extra historical videos are available contextually as well, giving information on past events, houses, and places. Sound and picture is superb, and the series continues to get more and more commentary and it's actually pretty good!

However, I had one problem: my copy showed up with two Disc 3 copies, and no Disc 2. While I have copies of the episodes on Disc 2 thanks to the digital copy (and HBO Go), I miss out on the extras. The DVDs may have the commentary, but I find the in-episode guide helpful and fascinating. Unfortunately, I waited too long to start my re-watch of season 3 and missed any deadline for returning the package to HBO. This does not seem to be a widespread issue, but it's frustrating to me. I like to have physical copies of my favorite HBO series so I can watch them in pristine quality at any time and enjoy the extras, and the packaging of the Game of Thrones series (and most HBO series) makes them good as keepable items. Not much good to keep a set of discs that's missing crucial episodes (which also damages future resale/trade-in value should I ever want it).",1395792000,,1574,4.538732394366197
5706451,5,B00C8CQRQ4,I love fantasy.  I can't wait until the next installment.  What should I expect to see in the future?  It drives my desire to read the series of books.,1395792000,,151,4.137931034482759
5706452,5,B00C8CQRQ4,Excellent show and superb sceneries and details of the era they are representing.  Riveting story.  Can't wait to see Season 4.,1395792000,,127,5.0
5706453,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"No doubt GoT is a great series - but the Blu Ray pack for Season 3 has a TON of Special Features and interactive pop-ups during the episodes.

The Rains of Castamere episode has a crazy commentary/feature where they play the entire episode in a small frame on the screen and there is a second frame with director commentary and behind the scenes footage.

Special Features and Commentaries are the only reasons I buy DVDs/Blu Ray and this has the most and best I've seen ever.  Great box set!",1395792000,,492,4.50561797752809

5706457,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"As always, Game of Thrones does not disappoint.  The imagery is amazing and the qualtiy of the blu-ray is impeccable.  My one negative would be that it took quite a few days to be delivered.  Rumor has it pre-order numbers were higher than expeced, so that may have played a part.  I wouldn't imagine anyone who is purchasing this at this point, would run into that problem.",1395792000,,374,4.537313432835821
5706458,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"The series continues to tug at your heart with amazing scripts, including the oft-talked about (no spoiler here) scene that seems to have come to define the HBO depiction of these books.  As far as a season goes, it holds its own, but it seems to be setting up the events of the next season more so than the previous seasons had.  Definitely worth it for the Game of Thrones fan, or just a fan of good drama.",1395705600,,408,4.217948717948718

5706461,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"My headline captures why i rated this Season so high. I particularly like the character development and dialogue. Some characters have remained shallow so far (Joffrey and Sansa as examples). Samwell, Jon Snow, Jaimie and Brienne have become central. I cant wait for Season 4 since, I believe, the Dragons take on greater significance as well as the intrigue within the Lanasters family. ETS",1395705600,,391,5.125

5706496,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"The story line is good , but is getting hard to keep up with with so many sub plots ? I chose this rating because i feel it
has lost a little of the story line by the many different plots that pop up in the middle of the story . ----just when you
think something is going to happen ----it switches to something different that does not include the previous story line
and makes you wonder what the out come will be while trying to absorb what is now to happen .

I recommend this to people who can follow several plots at the same time today and remember who everyone is
tomorrow ? ------I think it has a little to much nudity and language for anyone under 18 years old .",1395619200,,670,4.037593984962406

Season 3 can't compare, of course, to the first season but it was still captivating and has some of the most dramatic, inspiring, heartbreaking, and vomit-inducing scenes of any show I've seen. A well-told drama and a somewhat fair interpretation of the books.",1395619200,,406,4.8

5706518,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"My only real complaint is where the movies aren't true to the book. I guess I'm a purist, but some of the changes don't seem necessary to me. Or even make sense. The actors are very believable and have certainly pulled me into their story. I am from North America (USA) so oft times struggle with the unfamiliar accents and miss some words.
I rarely watch TV so getting this involved with a series is unusual enough so you know I must like it.
I'm going to have a tough time waiting for the next season to be released.",1395532800,,518,4.242424242424242

5706522,5,B00C8CQRQ4,This series has lost none of its punch through the 3rd season.  You have to pay attention to the numerous story lines going on that will continually hold your attention.  Costumes and location are great and it provides good humor as well.  Looking forward to the 4th season.,1395532800,,274,4.666666666666667

5706551,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I read the entire book series of ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" by Martin.  The series does do it justice, for the most part, even if it changes a few of the scenes of how the characters get to where they go in the book.  The actors and actresses embody the characters really, really well and a Martin book fan will not be disappointed with the series so far.  The only drawback is that there are only 10 episodes per season.

5706572,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of Thrones Season 3 continues with the brilliant adaptation of George R.R. Martin's books.  This is one of televisions most impressive accomplishments to date.  The set designs, costuming, etc are absolutely brilliant.  The acting is superb.

I am simultaneously reading Martin's books and I will say that the Game of Thrones series does vary considerably in many respects to the books.  That is understandable.  The books are long and incredibly complex from just about every standpoint.  The books can, in fact, become quite tedious in an over-abundance of detail.  The series cuts off a lot of that fat and does make many substantial changes.

This review, however, is primarily about the Game of Thrones: Season 3 Blu-ray/DVD disc set.  As usual, I went on a Game of Thrones viewing binge as soon as I got my set delivered.  My experience with this disc set is that it has worked flawlessly and the quality of the video is first rate. The set contains 5 Blu-ray discs  containing ten episodes.  Disc #5 contains only the final episode of Season 3: ""Mhysa"".  Unlike some reviews I have read, I have had no playback issues whatsoever with my Sony Blu-ray player and it is a relatively inexpensive 2 1/2 year-old model.  I did not have to perform any updates or other nonsense that some reviewers talk about.  That may be because the Sony performs automatic updates; I don't really know.  Some reviewers have complained that they were unable to watch any of their older Blu-ray discs or DVDs after performing an update to their player.  Fortunately, I have had no such issues.  My player still plays any of the older DVDs and Blu-ray discs without any problems.

I am not going to further review the Game of Thrones Season 3 series itself other than to say that if you are averse to (1) nudity (2) ""colorful"" language (3) copious amounts of blood  (4)violence then you'd best stay away.  Far away.  Game of Thrones is set in a fantasy Middle Ages type world somewhat similar to but also vastly different from the world of Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"".  It is not nearly as ""gentle"" as Tolkien's great work, however.  Just a word of advice for anyone who has not yet seen Game of Thrones: don't get too deeply emotionally attached or invested in ANY character.  You'll be sorry you did. ; )

The Game of Throne: Season 3 Blu-ray disc set is another total winner.  Highly recommended to any Game of Thrones fan.",1395446400,2,2416,4.688095238095238
5706573,5,B00C8CQRQ4,One of the best shows to date. And only getting better! I don't watch it on hbo because I don't want to have to wait a week for the next episode.,1395446400,,145,3.7096774193548385

5706581,3,B00C8CQRQ4,The acting and storyline remains sharp.  My concern is with the technology of the video streaming still not being up to par.  The picture quality is fuzzy at a times and we have never gotten through a whole episode without a problem which requires  a re-start.  I wish I bought it on DVD instead.,1395446400,,296,4.425925925925926

5706588,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"How anyone could give this show (any of the three seasons) less than 5 stars is beyond me. This is by far, not only the best HBO series ever done, but one of the best series ever done period. If one were to categorize and compare, say against the likes of the Lord of the Rings movie series, Gladiator, and Brave Heart. The Dexter TV series, Seinfeld, Star Trek, and even MASH TV series'. This is (in it's own right, and in the opinion of me, myself and I) the most captivating, mesmerizing, brutal, humbling, vulgar, ruthless, happiest, saddest, inspiring, and simply put, entertaining shows ever created. And it just keeps getting better with age, like a fine scotch whiskey. It will be a sad day when this series comes to a close. But for the time being I encourage anyone who has not yet indulged in this remarkable series to take a moment for themselves and become lost in an unforgettable game.

5706593,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"After reading the series several years ago, I was skeptical when I learned HBO was making a mini series based upon George R. R. Martin's,  ""A Song  of Fire and Ice"". I downloaded seasons 1, 2, and 3 to watch on my iPad while vacationing in Europe. In a word, outstanding. This series remains very true to the books and does a great job of character development. I subscribed to HBO while on vacation in order to watch season 4. My only criticism is at times I think the nudity is over done.",1395360000,,490,4.258064516129032

5706596,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Love this series and can't wait for future ones! The only issue I have -and I have purchased all 3 seasons of Games here- is that at least 1 or 2 of the discs for each season, have voice sync issues! It is SO disconcerting to try and watch, and have the mouths move long after we hear the words spoken! As much as I love Amazon and the great deals, I won't buy future BluRay or DVD's here just because it has not only happened with Games, but also with the complete Tudor series I also purchased here; with that one disc 2 was completely unwatchable due to continuious skipping.

I got to watch the first season and fell in love with it. I began to watch season 2 at a friends house but unfortunately I missed a few episodes and got behind. Because I was so behind on season 2, I didn't even try to watch season 3 when it was on and hearing everyone rave about it was killing me. Recently I decided I was just going to buy all the seasons on DVD and, of course, Amazon was the cheapest (or one of the at least). This is one of the best shows I have EVER seen. The writing is beautiful, the characters are fantastic, the acting is perfect... I can't believe season 4 is already right around the corner... of course i may not be able to watch it on HBO, but I will be buying the season when it comes out. :D",1395360000,,903,3.939890710382514

5706645,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"If you are expecting this season to live up to seasons 1&2 then you will not be disappointing. The packing is identical in style to the previous seasons, and you will once again be routing for your favorites and hope that they will not be dead by the end of the episodes (unless you read the books then you know who will and will not be meeting their doom).

 I won't bother with a story synopsis, if you are here you are either a fan of the show or shopping for one so I will make it simple. If you (or him/her/they) have seasons 1&2, then get this and continue with the adventure.",1395273600,,582,4.1415929203539825

Alas, there is nothing to differentiate it other then the cheap(albeit cool looking from afar) plastic dragon statue which just holds the same exact boxed set shrink wrapped inside a sad holster inside statue.

The content is exactly what I expected with each episode rendered in its original format with a myriad of extras added in. All in all an excellent purchase.  The chosen packaging is what loses one star for me. 1st the main box is encased in an annoying plastic sleeve that has the dragon shadow on it, that you have to remove every time you want to watch one of the episodes. Then the the discs themselves are in a cardboard accordion that you have have to unfold completely every time to gain access to your chosen disc.

First, I was sent the Blu-Ray copies - didn't work on my DVD player.  I called Amazon, told them the problem, and I had to send it back. They were very  quick to replace it.  I opened the package and there was a new copy except this time they sent me the Digital copy.  I called and told them that the second time, I was assured that this time I would get the DVD Copy and finally I got what I asked for.  Boy, what an irritating mess. And the kicker was that I ordered it in advance to make sure I got a copy as soon as it was out.  I've never had trouble with Amazon before and I hope I never do again!

We all know that the mad king had his way with whomever he wanted on the wedding night so when Tywin made the statement that the only thing keeping him from drowning his son was that he could ""not"" prove he was not his . Yes it was in the book to but made so much more vivid on screen the way it was put out there . Just maybe they gave us a hint as to why a certain person never gets sick either .Not even with the grayscale when he is subjected to it  hummm .And Vary's did say he was important to the realm that was why he tried to pay off Shae . Kind of makes one wonder .  There is so much you can catch the second time around. And it makes having to wait til April so much easier .

5706695,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"While still unquestionably the best fantasy show in the history of television, this season saw both some soaring highs as well as a few dips. What has been great about the show from the start remains great, and some characters who've stumbled before get fantastic moments and development in this season.

However some cracks are showing in the armor of this show, and most of them are romantic. While love has played into aspects of the show before it's never been sappy. At least not before this season. There are multiple romantic pairings, and while some work better than others none of them really bring anything new or interesting to the table. In fact they feel like they diminish some of these complex characters by reducing them to the clich of ""doing it all for love.""

Despite the stumbles this is undoubtedly a game changing season, as events in the last two episodes completely reshape the future of the Westeros. In many ways this feels like a season that's largely about setting the stage for what is to come: making sure that the proper players are in place while removing those who don't really matter in the grand scheme. That makes it essential, though perhaps not quite as inherently enjoyable as the first two seasons.",1395187200,2,1238,4.753488372093023
5706696,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"The third season of ""Game of Thrones"" continues to provide depth and an ever intriguing storyline where the machinery of those seeking power and those in power continue to grind against each other.

George R. R. Martin's novel (his third) that forms the basis of the series benefits from a streamlined storyline and a slightly reduced group of characters in the TV version. While it isn't necessary to have read the novels it certainly is fascinating to contrast the way that they've elected to tell the same story in different mediums.

SPOILERS:

Tyrion (Peter Dinklage who continues to give a outstanding performance) recovers from helping to defend the city against the forces of Stannis Baratheon(Stephen Dillane) only to find that his father Tywin (Charles Dance) is seen as the savior of the city and made Hand of the King. Tyrion also discovers that his evil nephew King Joffrey tried to have him murdered on the battlefield.

Rob Stark (Richrad Madden) continues to win battles but struggle to keep his fragile alliance together which, ultimately, culminates in the infamous ""black wedding"" in the penultimate episode of the season.

Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) continues to gather her own forces including buying a mercenary army as part of her plans to gradually take back her kingdom.

The rest of the Stark children are still on the run.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray looks terrific with a nice, detailed transfer. Blacks are deep and rich while detail is rich throughout.

The audio remains outstanding as well with a very active lossless surround him. Subtitles are in English and Spanish.

The special features include 12 commentary (some episodes have more than one) tracks with a mix of behind-the-scenes creative folks as well as cast.

Featurettes include ""A Gathering Storm"", ""New Characters"" profile and a picture-in-picture piece for the episode  ""The Rains of Castamere Unveiled"" the most emotionally taxing episode of the series.

The deleted and extended scenes are worthwhile checking out as they include pieces that extend the characters but were, undoubtedly, cut for pacing and time.

""Inside the Wildlings"" gives us a glimpse into the characters beyond the wall while ""The Politics of Marriage"" lives up to its title focusing on the various unions and why they are pursued.

There is also a set of DVDs included in a separate cardboard container. The set is handsomely packaged with a slipcase that features the image you see here of the dragon's shadow.

HBO has done an outstanding job of providing additional value for fans who watched the series on their network with their Blu-ray releases. Unlike Showtime which often releases some of their flagship series with little to nothing in the way of special features, HBO makes the Blu-ray worthwhile for fans to pick up and watch again.",1395187200,2,2826,5.071274298056156

My biggest complaint (though I understand why it was done this way) is telling Theon's story during season 3 when apparently it's not revealed until Book 5 (and I'm only on Book 4! Spoilers!).",1395100800,,377,4.8

With season three, I see the story being appropriately condensed - In such a way that I believe I like the condensed movie story better than the story in the book.  The most important elements of book three were retained and possibly made even clearer in the DVDs.  I am finding the story coming even more alive in the TV-Cable-DVD version than I experienced in the books, although I enjoyed the books very much - it doesn't happen often that I prefer the movie to the book.",1395100800,,689,4.540322580645161

5706707,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I don't have HBO so I waited anxiously for Season 3 to finally be released on DVD. There is nothing like GAME OF THRONES on TV or in the theaters. In fact, GAME OF THRONES surpassing just about any theatrical movie for quality and visual effects. A TV version of GAME OF THRONES allows for deeper character and story details. Sadly, there are only 10 episodes in the Season 3 but they are 10 seriously powerly episodes. GAME OF THRONES is addictive and can't be missed. It is set in a mythical land that looks and feels like medieval Europe. The costumes and settings are lavish. It feels not expense was spared in the filming of this remarkable show. It is an actor and Casting Director's dream with parts for actors of all ages, sizes and looks.

 I could spend pages extolling the virtues of the cast of Season 3 but I feel there are two amazing standouts. Maisie Williams plays young Arya Stark trying to avenge her father's murder and reunite with her family. Dressed as a boy she exudes anger and determination in her face. We feel her anger and pain and determination. This fine young actress has a bright future. Another remarkable actor is Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy. This season he is a prisoner being tortured by a mysterious person. Allen is so believable in his pain and misery. We see it in his eyes and actions. Here is another actor to watch.
It is great to see lovely Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell. We rarely see this fine British actress and it's a joy to see her as the aging Tyrell Matriach in a role she obviously loves. Add in beloved character actor Charles Dance and the gorgeous Natalie Dormier and we have quite the cast and again, I could go on for pages just discussing the actors.

There is a ""look"" to GAME OF THRONES that deserves praise for the production team. The lavish locales are awesome. We are taken from dark and forbodding locations to lush and lovely settings. It's hard to imagine all the work involved in filming this series.

A word of caution. GAME OF THRONES is not for the squeamish. Season 3 brings us to new heights of gore and violence. This season maiming and loss of body parts are on the agenda. No one is safe and no one is spared as the innocent kill the innocent. It's war afterall we hear over and over.

5706710,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"This show does!  Seriously, my wife and I are diehard supporters of HBO, having seen many shows over the years.  This is by far
the most epic, detailed, world believable, amazingly cast show with the best, delicious dialogue spoken.

A little background, huge fan of Carnivale, Deadwood, Entourage, True Blood, and 6 Ft Under.  Unlike True Blood, and even Deadwood which seemed to drop the ball on it's 3rd or later seasons, GoT has remained strong.  We don't have cable, so anxiously await the Blu-ray releases.

This Blu-ray is flawless.  I have a 92"" screen, 7.1 surround. The picture and audio is so enveloping.  Can't say enough good things.  Looking forward to next year for Season 4!",1395100800,,690,4.829059829059829
5706711,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"So...if you're a GOT (Game of Thrones) fan, there's nothing more I can add that hasn't already been said. However, I want to address the product/packaging itself.

Here's what I like:
Amazon is quick on delivery. As an Amazon Prime member, I received the product on the very day it was released. Outstanding!

HBO provides good value in the product in that it includes Blu-Ray, DVD, and a Ultraviolet (UV) copy within the package. For ease and convenience, I like being able to binge watch the program through my VUDU/Flixster/UV accounts without having to change discs every couple of episodes. For me, this is a great and I wish more companies would offer this value for the price.

Here's what I don't like:
O.k...I said I wouldn't review the product, and I'm not. However, I wish (for the cost), there were more episodes since there are only 10 per season. Of course, those 10 are very well done, but only last an hour. So...at regular price, you're basically paying nearly four bucks per episode. Ditto for other HBO shows like ""Girls"". And, VEEP has only eight episodes per season.",1395100800,,1087,4.7407407407407405

5706714,5,B00C8CQRQ4,HBO did a great job this season with upping the ante. Danerys continues her quest for power. Jon Snow is a crow no more. The brotherhood without banners is introduced. Overall it is a complicated but fulfilling season.,1395100800,,218,4.7631578947368425

No, Mr. Gaiman, but he is running out of time as HBO brings his brilliant series to life. I'm a huge fan of the books and a huge fan of this show. The Red Wedding's trending on Twitter was no accident, and you have to see it. Emilia Clarke and Maisie Williams have blown me away and made me a fan after my initial opposition to their casting (I thought both were too old for the parts). Headey, Dinklage, Fairley, and Coster-Waldau are incredible as always and this cast is one of the best on television in the last 20 years, hands down.

The acting is incredible, the photography some of the best I've ever seen, and the sets and costume design out of this world. Honestly, Just buy it.",1395014400,,743,4.26241134751773

This season was even more awesome then the others and I cant wait for Season 4 already.

5706765,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Superb acting, production, story, etc. etc.  To get somewhat picky, some of the actors mumble their lines, speak too quickly and/or the mike pickup is such that one cannot hear what they say regardless. This seems to be an increasing problem in movies and TV shows and you start to think maybe it's that your hearing is going.  But then you watch older shows and find good clarity.  So I believe it's just a matter of laziness on the part of some or perhaps the movie and TV directors let things go in order to meet deadlines. Also, keeping track of the various characters and their place in the ""game"" can easily become confusing but one only has to access the provided plot and character reviews for a good reminder of this.",1394928000,,726,4.484848484848484

Some parts were pretty dull, and by stepping up the violence didn't make it more interesting.
Its all epic but nothing is really going on or if it is they will need 20 seasons to get there. The Dragon Queen story-line is just not very believable, and started out as my favorite in the previous seasons. The effects of the little dragons are great, and the set of the entire show and costumes are all awesome. The story is going at a very slow pace, the worst story line with the weakest characters were all killed off, but not much else really happened.

Overall, I still like the series and will purchase season 4 when it comes out - but hope that it will become a little better in that season.",1394841600,,372,4.285714285714286
5706788,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of Thrones has easily become one of my favorite television programs, and this latest season released on blu-ray is truly something to behold. The production of this program seems to increase tenfold season to season as HBO attracts more viewers, so not only is the story itself engaging but it is a visual masterpiece for television.
I have read all of the books that have been published, so I can say as a fan of the novels that you ought not be skeptical of the visual format of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". That being said, yes, the show does take a few liberties but what else can be expected when each book is a thousand pages or more in length. Some people argue that HBO has taken away some of the quality of the source material, but I find any changes acceptable.
The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because the inner packaging was torn upon arrival. Like the other blu-ray collections for this show, season three unfolds into one long cardboard piece. One of the segments was torn, so as a result I have to be very delicate with the box. Seeing how this season was just released when I purchased it I blame the damage on either the packaging amazon ships the blu-ray in, or perhaps how an amazon or postal employee handled the item.",1394841600,,1265,4.3872340425531915

Hopefully, the writers, producers, actors and production workers are able to keep it up.  Well done all around.  It is this type of inovative, almost independent production companies that may awaken the major studios on how to do business and still produce a quality product.  At least, I think, following a European model of work ethic that acting- either on stage, screen or TV, is at the end of the day - acting.",1394755200,,524,4.484210526315789

The book goes into so much more detail with the stories and characters it would honestly be a shame if you have not read them.
The TV seasons are actually starting to slow down from the books, there is actually more that happens in the 3rd book than what happens in the show as well as the stories actually conflict quite a bit. Still this show is a masterpiece and they picked the perfect cast to play all of the characters thus far.
Highly recommended!",1394755200,,617,4.15

In fact, if you're going to have a bunch of people with dragons and armor and feasts and lutes you have to earn my respect, because my inclination is to dislike those things. This show is respectable, and - more importantly - enjoyable. Big fun, great stories. And Peter Dinklage? Don't get me started.

great job at making you like or hate them. Some just don't like from day one. That's the beauty of these characters. You really
have to pay attention to the characters names and where they are from because they are mentioned many times and there are
many different story lines going on all at once that will eventually meld together into one. In this season you actually see a different side to one of the unlikeable characters. Love all the special features. Season 3 was just as good as 1 & 2. Can't wait for Season 4.

The dvds come in their own little package (not nearly as fancy as the blu ray) but I also take the digital copy.
I bought season 2 this way as well.
The show is awesome (obviously read the books too).  Violence and nudity for everyone and political intrigue and dragons for the nerds. This is a win win for everyone involved.

One of the main characters runs a brothel- how do you show THAT without a little t and a?? All that aside, the acting is phenomenal, the writing is some of the best I've seen in a television drama (the acting and writing are better than I see in most movies).

Thus I have watched but the first two episodes. I have been underwhelmed, feel no need to plow through the remaining episodes. Indeed, the TV remains off, as I have chosen to sit in my wingchair and read an Honor Harrington novel instead ... as interesting and way less graphically bloody.

I do not have cable or satellite TV, so the DVDs are the only way I can watch serial shows. GOT is exceptional - the writing, direction, acting, costumes, sets - it's all extremely high-quality and brilliant.

Be prepared for gratuitous violence, sex, and drinking (not quite a ""family"" show) but if that sort of thing is entertaining for you, this series is a must-see.",1394582400,,527,4.595744680851064

5706875,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"I've viewed all three seasons of Game of Thrones strictly through the Blu-ray medium. The production values are superb, the story and characters enthralling, etc. No problem with the content itself.

However, I have down-rated this set based on its whole hearted embrace of the Blu-ray characteristic of the incredibly long (and seemingly growing) time it takes to load a disc and start viewing actual program content. On this set, besides the minutes-long blank screen (with an occasional ""tree"" icon), we are also forced to watch a couple meaningless clips from other series, and some ominous warnings such as ensuring the ""language"" setting on our player is correct.

If the Blu-ray designers and programmers were intending to hasten the end of physical media and push us all toward on-line viewing, then they are doing a fine job.",1394496000,,834,5.08029197080292

5706879,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"A somewhat slow start to the season  also leads one to believe that the nudity and violence have been intentionally cut from the show. Things pick up a few episodes in, as does the nudity,erotica and graphic portrayal of violence. A few scenes late in the season are actually cringe-worthy. However,- overall the nudity, sex and violence are (as usual for the series) integral to flushing out this world, it's inhabitants and the story itself. It seems the screen plays are more nuanced then in past seasons when dealing w/ mature subject matters; in a graphic visual sense. The plot lines twist and turn (to the worst) for many characters, and almost no one is safe from Bad happenings. Really Bad.  Three plot lines out of what-ten?....drag on and/or never really come to full fruition , but even those have a final  revelation or the genesis of one- which will continue in season four. Eight out of ten episodes are so riveting at some point that you find your self saying"" just one more episode before bedtime"" etc. Holy mother of spectacle- this show just keeps getting better in most ways. 9 out of 10",1394409600,,1107,4.666666666666667

5706885,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"I love this series.  I read the books and the HBO series is excellent.  This is the best season so far.  My disappointment is with the Blu-ray discs themselves.  There must be a serious manufacturing problem.  The first set I got, one of the discs would not load. I returned it and the replacement they sent me had the same problem with a differnt disc.  I updated my player firmware, but that did not help.  I had amazon send me a third replacement, but I did not send the second set back.  I was hoping that between the two sets, I could compile a complete set of working discs.  The third replacement set had 2 bad discs, one of them the same as the second set.  So that is 3 bad sets that I received.  I decided to go buy another box set from my local Costco, and one of those discs was bad as well!!! So with 3 different box sets in my possession at the same time, I was FINALLY able to pull out the working discs to create a complete working set.  It took 4 box sets in all to get a working product.
So my advice if you want this: check all discs when you receive it.  If they don't work, ask for a replacement, but choose to return by dropping off at a UPS store.  Amazon gives you 30 days to drop it off.  Get as many sets as you need to compile 5 working discs.
The manufacturing problems are unacceptable.  I thought maybe only Amazon got a bad batch from the manufacturer, but it looks like they may all be defective anywhere you buy them.  I am happy to have a working product now, but the customer should not have to go through this process to get it.",1394409600,94,1564,4.092105263157895

The Blue-ray set has the same issues as the earlier season sets: awkward packaging, uneven spacing (one disc will have three episodes, another only one, all of equal length, the extra features are sparse and randomly distributed over some of the discs rather than bundled at the end, and generally the menu access is not terribly intuitive.

I won't subscribe to their channel because of it's mostly crappy content.  I love this show but loathe HBO.  Now with my complaining out of the way.  Kudos to this production staff, actors and all the other people who make this show happen! These people are serious about their craft. The entertainment value is through the roof, even if fantasy isn't your thing, it's worth watching just for the sheer magnificence of every location and set and brilliant direction and let's not forget this cast.  Martin is fortunate to have his series made into this TV show.  His books aren't as good as this production!

5706907,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I have read all of George Martin's books, and this series takes great liberties with the story.  I think half the stuff in the TV series is made up, using the same characters but creating dialogue and scenes that were not in the books.  That said, they do a pretty good job of lengthening the whole series through these creative additions.  I really like the dwarf (Tyrion) in this series (especially now with his scar on the cheek).  Jeffrey, the King, is still a total jerk, and many of the scenes that create out of nothing do a good job of making you dislike the boy king even more.  One thing about the series is they do skip around from section to section a lot, so you have to pay attention or you won't have a clue what is happening. (If you haven't read the books, you have no clue what is going to happen down the road to people like Jon Snow,Jeffrey,Sansa, etc.  What a delightful series!!!",1394236800,,901,4.333333333333333

Everything was as depicted in the picture- it was bigger than I initially thought, which is a huge plus, as it looks so much cooler and bolder! The wings of the dragon are SO beautiful and surprisingly sturdier than I expected! (Although do NOT put pressure on them in case of accidental damage.) The actual DVD box fits inside the tomb, so be very careful when taking your box in and out of the tomb casing - as the top does not connect to the base as well as you'd think! Nonetheless, that doesn't bother me at all and I am in love!
All in all, it was a great buy and definitely worth the money! Fast shipping, no problems at all, and a great collectors item which doubles as a show piece suitable for any GoT fans!",1394236800,,875,4.183431952662722

5706914,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I had been waiting (none too patiently) for this season to finally come out and I was not disappointed.  The problem is, if you only see the show on blu-ray and then gobble them up in just a few nights because you can't not just turn to the next episode, not only do you lose sleep, but you get so wrapped up in the world of Game of Thrones that its hard to come back down.  As ever, this show is full of sex and beauty, horror and honor, grace and violence.  The special effects are very good--especially love the dragons--and its so compelling that you can't not watch it, even the bits that have you wincing or wishing you had covered your eyes.

This season is full of surprises, most of them not so good for our well-loved characters.  That's one thing about this show...you never know if someone will be there tomorrow or not.  And, all the while, we see the progress being made by Daenerys as she comes into her own, as much as her dragons, and continues on her quest to go back to Westeros and take back the Iron Throne.  She is so lovely and so inspiring and I hope hope hope that when she finally engages in the Game of Thrones with all of the rest of the would-be Kings and Queens that the show really pulls off what they are hinting at.

Some spoilers below:

As said above, one of my favorite story lines revolves around Daenerys.  I love it when she surprises her own supporters and keeps on growing in wisdom and strength.  Her resolve not to undermine what she believes in in the process of raising her army is precisely what will make her a great Queen, as well as her will to punish those who enslave others.  You go, girl!

I am also shockingly fascinated by the growing relationship between Jaime and his female-knight-protector, and how much I have grown to not necessarily forgive Jaime for his past actions, but to understand where they come from.  Just as with Cersei and Tyrion...the author of their bad behavior firmly lies with their father.  But, on the other hand, their father is not a flat boring bad guy per se, as he is acting only out of what he sees as necessary to protect his family and his family's name.  The Lannisters are definitely a family you can love to hate.  Though, of course, out of all of them, I do adore their blacksheep, Tyrion, who has a heart of melting gold that he tries and fails to hide and protect.

The storyline with Jon Snow continues to build as he is forced to consider what he truly believes in, and who he believes in.  I very much see him being a mover and shaker in future stories as the White Walkers and other creatures begin to trek southwards as Winter comes.  The climb up the Wall in this season was truly frightening.

As for the Starks...OMG...well, 'nuff said.  Things have definitely been going from bad to worse to impossible for this poor family.  Though, I am enjoying the shamanistic aspect of the three-eyed raven dreams and the introduction of being able to look through the eyes of animals and control them...I am still left wondering how this will play into the next season.  What can one crippled boy and his friends do in the face of the White Walkers?  I suppose we will find out...

As for the rest...conspiracy, darkness disguised as light and light as darkness, hardship, loss, grief, anger, religious fanaticism...this show stalks them all.  The only thing I felt went on for too long was the whole torture stuff with Theon (not one of my favorite characters)--blechy!  It just seemed too much a bit pointless, but who knows?  This show has pulled many rabbits out of many hats before.

Once again--an absolute MASSIVE HIT of a show!  Now, I have to start the long wait for Season 4 to come out...bummer.",1394150400,2,3698,4.450222882615156

I'm an avid fan of the first three novels, and while I withhold my judgment on the series until he finished writing the rest, I thought Martin and HBO did a very nice job of capturing the essence of part III. I was also anxious about how they would handle the end of the season, but the action was awesome and ended with an even better cliffhanger that begs a bigger question that many might have overlooked if they had left the climax for the final episode.

Yet I must say that I still worry that this project is too ambitious especially given that Martin still hasn't finished his books and he's getting up there in age.

5706955,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I don't even know what to say...

This season was crazy, but that goes without saying on the last two seasons of GoT anyway, right?  Problems are started to get bigger now...and at the end of Season 3, you get the feeling that something grand will be upon Westeros in a ridiculous way.

If you aren't on board yet, you need to give this a try, but you MUST start from Season 1.  Reading the books is not necessary, but if you have trouble keeping track of characters, you might want to do that first.

I am a big fan of sci-fi like Star trek Next Generation; Battlestar Gallactica; Firefly; and Vikings (you could argue VIkings isn't sci-fi, but it's close to medieval sci-fi)  Anyone who enjoys those items should definitely give this a try.

My ONLY complaint with this season, is that it ended without any cliffhangers.  You pretty much know exactly how Season 4 is going to start.  The 2nd to last episode really felt like a typical series finale, but I digress.  I'm not against how it ended, I just find it a bit different is all.

But without getting into spoilers...let's talk about what you get.

-Packaging- The bluray copies come in a map style folding format with striking photos of the main characters.  I'm not a huge fan of folding maps, as I never know how to do that...but luckily this is much less complicated.  The DVD copies come in a small and relatively plain sleeve...that is nudged inside the main cover.  I'm just glad that the DVD copies exist...it's a nice option for someone who wants to watch them at a friends house..but you know they don't have a bluray player.  Or perhaps your 2nd TV or whatever doesn't have one.

-Audio/Visual quality:  I can't compare this to the HBO streamed version, because I don't have HBO.  I played this on my ps4 and full 5.1 surround sound.  The audio is, as expected, fantastic.  Whether it's the sweeping music, fantastic actors/actresses, the sounds really bring you into the environment.  This series takes you far north of the wall, all over Westeros, and of course east to Qarth.  Each environment is unique and given much care.

-Extra features: Tons.  And I really enjoyed the ""Histories and Lore"" of of GoT on disc 5.  This was well made and well narrated.  The addition of narrations should make this have a bit of re playability as well.",1393977600,,2309,4.568292682926829

Also that once updated your seasons 1 and 2 are useless because they don't play with the newest update.  I was required to update and none of my previous seasons work now as stated by many other people.  Also same with others discs 3-5 of season 3 will not play.,1393891200,2,396,4.383561643835616
5706965,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"It is almost impossible to write a review that does not give too much away, but I will be as general as possible with the description so as not to give away major spoilers.

The series of course is based on the series of books by George R.R. Martin.  If you have not read the books or seen the prior two seasons you cannot really jump into season three because there is just too much going on to pick it up in the middle. There are a lot of characters and story lines that jump back and forth, so you really do have to pay attention to figure out who is who and what side everyone is on.  Each season is essentially a mini-series that follows the events of one book. It is spread out throughout 10 episodes and the story keeps building upon itself.

If you are new to the series or looking at this because you have heard of it and are wondering what it is all about, you need to know that the show is very violent and has a lot of sexual content.  So if that is the kind of thing you do not want to watch then this is not the show for you.  It is set in a medieval fantasy world and involves a war to rule a kingdom.  While there are some truly evil characters, most have some shades of gray to them so they are not really all good or all bad.  And this is definitely a story where no character, no matter how central to the story is safe.

This season sees Daenerys Targaryen amassing an army to try to take back the throne, and on the surface it looks like she is the best equipped to do so.  Tywin Lannister; fresh off saving the day at the end of last season begins to show how much power he really has and while this means Tyrion, the only ""good"" member of the family is brought to heel somewhat, you do get see Joffrey put in his place to some extent.  The threat of the White Walkers continues, but we only continue to see them sporadically at this point just as has been the case in the first two seasons.  The Wildlings who Jon Snow encountered at the end of last season also have a much larger role in the third season.  In all there are about 5 ongoing story lines including those of Arya, Bran and Jamie Lannister.  I think they did a good job given all the stories as close to equal time as possible, even though some episodes gave more weight to one or two from time to time.

The high point of the season, not only in terms of the shocking nature of it but what it does to set the stage going forward is the ""red wedding.""  It is so pivotal to the series that there is about an hour long bonus feature devoted solely to that episode that contrasts it with how it played out in the book, and really broke down how they made it work for the show.  As for the other bonus materials for those who do get the discs, there is about 2 hrs of bonus features from making of and behind the scenes features, as well as deleted scenes and an interactive history of all the various regions in the Game Of Thrones world.  Definitely a lot of material for those who like to go through the bonus features.  Of course the show looks and sounds great on blu ray, and you will get the show on DVD as well.

Most likely you will have some idea if you are looking at this page about what the show is.  If you are a diehard fan and have seen the other seasons, this offers much of the same.  If you are curious as to what it is about, subject to the provisos I stated above about the nature of the series, if you are a fan of the fantasy genre, it is definitely worth checking out.",1393891200,,3474,4.048245614035087

5706970,4,B00C8CQRQ4,"It's not only the complete immersion that Martin offers in lessons of English medieval history and there fore human character under stress that stood out from the regular fare of television. It is also his refusal to ""moralize,"" to inject the episodes with a patronizing filter whereby ""the good guy wins,"" or ""the bad guy gets it,"" that gave the episodes such force for me. With Benioff and Weiss' effective transference from the novel to screenplay form, each character arc is shown through the prism of their needs,  their utterly human selves, as opposed to an author playing ""god"" and warping what a character might do in an idealized setting, ""here's the last scrap of bread, Jim, here, you take it- you got a wife and kids..""

5706986,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Season three of Game of Thrones has finally won me over.  I tried reading the novels off and on without much success, I wasn't too hooked after season one either... but season two really improved in my opinion.  A lot more intrigue and drama was evenly spaced and made for much better television.

Season three is very interesting because there is a lot going on, but the story moves at a great pace between the main story lines.  I felt the familial issues between the Lannister siblings and pops was very well done and added another little bit of animosity.  The other story lines kept going from where they left off.  I won't add any spoilers, but as in season 2, Daenerys' story continues to awe me.

The pace is more even, the drama isn't too over the top, and the action is intense but not overly silly with cartoonish violence.

All in all it's a great series that continues to get better.  And my oh my, what a wedding we have in store!!!",1393804800,,946,4.390804597701149

SERIES:
I started watching the series from the start and I very seldomly purchase a TV Season....let alone the entire series.  But I have found this series very entertaining.  There are twist and surprises during this season that makes me look forward to the next season.
DVD/BlueRay:
I am a bit disappointed in the BluRay.  I have found it is very slow in starting.  It seems that the BluRay sits, while it's loading.  I wish there was more though on the BluRay as it should be an immediate load right to the menu.  But it takes several minutes to get to the episode menu.",1393718400,,615,4.350877192982456

5707012,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Just like the third book was by far and away the best in the written series, the 3rd season
of the HBO series is absolutely exceptional. First two seasons I found myself intrigued by some of the storylines, but bored by some of the others. Not the case in the third season, at all. I found myself caring about every second of the show, from the titanic battle between the Starks and Lannisters, to John Snow's daring adventures amongst the Wildlings. I really can't think of one weak performance among any of the characters -- even some of the younger actors like the young man who played Joffrey just hit everything out of the park. Some of the actors are so good they actually improve upon their characters as they were written in the books -- the actor who plays Stannis Baratheon, for example, is just incredible and steals just about every scene he is in; or the actress who plays Ygritte, a very minor character in the books, but here you find you really care about the fate of this character (and her relationship with John Snow); or the actor who plays the impossibly evil Ramsay Snow, totally different from how I pictured him after reading the books (ie. he's small and kind of puny, almost looks like Elijah Wood's evil twin), and yet he is truly terrifying and utterly convincing as a pure and unapologetic sociopath. In short, this is by far and away the best installment in the TV series so far. Will they be able to continue the momentum into season four? If its only half as good as season three it will be absolutely worth watching.
All kinds of pressure now for Martin to finish off books six and seven and really give this outstanding television crew something to work with.",1393632000,2,1693,4.5359477124183005

More and more I grow to like Tywin Lannister. I wonder if he is a hard man because he likes being hard or is he hard because his family have made him this way.

5707029,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"I'm into my third season.

I still have no idea who half the people are because they all look the same, talk the same, and every other person is king of something. I've got the ""Knight's Watch"" down, the Blondie with the dragons and her ilk, and King Geoffrey and his ""beautiful people"".
The rest are just a bunch of dirty buggers, in dirty armor, fighting a war.

Still, for some reason I can't stop watching.

It probably has a lot to do with my love of shows such as ""The Tudors"", ""Borgia: Faith and Fear"", and ""Rome"". I'm a sucker for anything Medieval and before.

Obviously, GOT is fiction... Put me into any period piece and I can draw a frame of reference.

Now, before I get comments about how stupid I am (I'm not), I DO get the overall picture.

Big war, several sides, plenty of cities involved.

All that being said, it is a beautifully scripted show. The acting continues to be outstanding. And the fantasy-end of the show continues to pick up.

I hadn't seen this season yet and I managed to make it till I watched it before heard any spoilers. The only thing I have to say now is that I wish I had read the spoliers! I was completely unprepared for the Red Wedding. It totally took me off guard but that's why we love this show. I have now started reading the books so I won't so gobsmacked. I love this show, The actors are amazing. The story line is exciting and its really a story you can get caught up in. George RR Martin has done very well signing up with HBO and after reading the first book and seeing the first season I have to say they really respect his story. The behind the scenes stuff is super cool to look at and I gave my mom the extra dvds that came with it so she can watch it too! Great Purchase.",1393545600,,882,3.8784530386740332

5707051,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of Thrones is one of the few shows I never see when it originally airs, and I always pick up the season Blu-ray. It's becoming a bit of a tradition for me. Fortunately, I am more of a casual viewer of television, but I must admit GOT really intrigued me from the first season. The premise and the notion of high fantasy on the ""small screen"" is no doubt interesting, but what follows suit is a complex political entanglement. As far as I am concerned, everything is right with this show. The casting is superb across the board, though some actors shine more than others. But, that is the nature of the beast. The third season doesn't seem to have as much momentum as earlier seasons, but it seems to bring more of a conclusion to the Stark family as is really begun in Season 1. The balance between sadness and happiness brought by laughter allows this show to feel very real and human, and thus entertaining. You get addicted to characters then see them removed from the game quickly, to mixed reviews and opinions. The world here feels real.

The actual package is solid enough. I never really care for all the add-ons and what have you, and 30$ was a reasonable price to pay for the 10 episodes of this season on Blu-ray.

I'm actually sad I finished Seasons 1, 2, and 3 because I want MORE.  I did go back and watch Season 1, now on Season 2.  There are many little things I missed.

5707066,5,B00C8CQRQ4,This is an excellent series as its many fans agree. Production values and acting are superb. Can't say how true to the books it is - it's been way too long since I read them but it certainly felt as though I was back in that world. Sometimes continuity suffers as they cut from following one thread to another and we seem to be lacking events that have occurred since that thread was last visited. Having the whole season was a tasty treat and I watched it in two sessions. Seemed eerily reminiscent of some current(Feb 2014) events.,1393459200,,533,4.448979591836735

It is refreshing to have a show where no one is safe, but also maddening when a favorite character gets killed. For those who haven't read the books, there are constant surprises. I can't imagine watching it from week to week, since the end of each episode leaves one breathless to find out what will happen next. I always wait until the DVDs come out and then have a weekend marathon. It is good enough that once is not enough.

Minor changes in the plot compared to the book are a necessary evil due to the overwhelming amount of characters in the book, surely any reader would understand characters have to be cut.

I like features and this one is lacking to be clear.  I expected more.

I hate the fact that the season is only 10 episodes on 5 discs.  For the time it took to get this Pre-Order it was a letdown with the content, so I think the series needs to improve the product put on DVD Sets.  It does come with a book that lists basic information, but not the disc information I was expecting Like; Episode and short description for each disc.

My set played perfectly fine, but I watched the entire season in one sitting without much effort so I called it a short season in my opinion.

5707113,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"Five stars for the first season, four stars for the second season, three stars for this season. This story is crying out for some tight editing.

  First of all I'd drop the Bran story. That kid has been wondering around the woods looking at three eyed crows for the last season and a half. He hasn't really contributed to the plot since he got thrown out of a tower in the first episode. Next to go is Theon Greyjoy. We spent all of season three watching this guy get tortured. Why? And finally I'd drop Stanis Baratheon and the red witch. Should of snuffed this guy at the battle for Kings Landing. Instead we get an entire season of him licking his wounds. None of these people spoke a single word to any of the story's main characters for the entire thrid season.

  In my opinion there are four great stories here and we should stick with them. Aria's story is great. The Kings Landing stuff is the meat of the story. Jon Snow's adventures beyond the wall, terrific. Daenerys Targaryen's story, great. Everytime we move away from one of those four stories the show comes to a grinding halt while we wait to get back to the characters we care about.

  Less would be more in season four.",1393286400,8,1191,4.401826484018265
5707114,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Game of Thrones is probably my favorite television series.  When it first premiered, I was intrigued, but I had trouble following along because of all the characters. I gave it a second chance when HBO ran a Season 1 marathon before the start of Season 2, and that time, I was immediately hooked.  I have now seen all three seasons of the HBO show, and I am very excited about Season 4, which premieres in April.

Season 3 of Game of Thrones covers the first half of Storm of Swords, which is the third book in George R.R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire series.  The biggest theme in Season 3 is that of change; alliances change constantly, nothing can be predicted, and no one is safe.  The Battle of Blackwater, which ended Season 2, was certainly a turning point in the War of Five Kings, but the war is far from over.  Stannis Baratheon has retreated to his castle at Dragonstone, and is planning his next move with Melisandre, the Red Priestess.

Back in Kings Landing, Joffrey Baratheon continues his career as king of the realm/psychotic teenager.  He has broken his engagement to Sansa Stark, and agreed to marry Margaery Tyrell because of the Tyrells role in saving Kings Landing during the Battle of Blackwater.  Sansa remains a hostage in the court, unsure of her future, but grateful for Margaerys friendship.

Jamie Lannister, who was taken prisoner by the Starks, has been set free by Catelyn Stark.  He is to be escorted to Kings Landing by the warrior maid Brienne of Tarth, where he is to be exchanged for Sansa and Arya Stark.  Jamie and Brienne have some great chemistry, and I really enjoyed their scenes together.

Unbeknownst to them, Arya Stark is not in Kings Landing.  She has been out on the road since the very end of Season 1.  She has managed to escape from Harenhall with her friends Gendry and Hot Pie.  But the roads are not a safe place for two teenage boys and a girl, even if that girl is as feisty as Arya.  Eventually, Arya acquires a very unlikely partner in crime.  To reveal the identity of her cohort would be a spoiler, but I will say that I would watch a spinoff of these two characters all day long.

Robb Stark finds himself in a precarious position.  His mothers actions cost him some key allies, and he must approach Walder Frey for assistance in regrouping and preparing his next step towards winning the war.  Theres just one problem: Robb was supposed to have married one of Walder Freys daughters, but he married someone else instead.  Is Walder a forgiving man?

Jon Snow has infiltrated the Wilding camp beyond the wall, and met their king, Mance Rayder.  He finds himself captivated by a Wilding woman named Ygritte, but will falling in love distract him from his mission?

Across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen strives to build the army that she needs to conquer Westeros.  She does not have very much gold, but she does have her three dragons.  Will that be enough?

One of my favorite things about this season is the music, especially the showrunners choice to make The Rains of Castamere, the Lannister family song be played or mentioned repeatedly this season.  Cersei and Margaery even have a conversation about the song, and then it is played in the most pivotal scene in the entire season.  It is just such a delightful bit of foreshadowing.  Another aspect of the music that I liked was the music that played over the credits at the end of each episode.  It was different every time, and the choices are just fraught with symbolism.

The acting is phenomenal.  No one, in my opinion, was a weak link.  I was particularly impressed by the teenage actors/actresses, who do such fine work with difficult material.  King Joffrey, in particular, brought psychotic behavior to a new level.  He swaggers about during the day bullying people and sneering, but his dark tastes come out at night.  He considers himself to be very important, and it is very satisfying to see Tywin Lannister, his maternal grandfather, reduce him to a petulant child.

One of my favorite scenes involves Joffrey with Margaery Tyrell.  Margaery has gotten intel from Sansa regarding Joffrey, and she feigns interest in his crossbow.  He is just thrilled to pieces when she asks if she can touch it.  Oh, the symbolism!

My favorite new character had to be Olenna Tully, Margaerys grandmother, and the matriarch of the Tully family.  Without a doubt, she is the Dowager Countess of Westeros because she always has a sharp word for those who deserve it, but she treats Sansa Stark with kindness and dignity.

Game of Thrones is not for everyone.  The language, violence, and sexual situations are all explicit.  This show is rated TV-MA, which is the equivalent of an R rating.  It is intended for an adult audience.  If I had one negative thing to say about the show it would be that the torture of one particular character went on for far too long and was beginning to resemble torture porn.  Enough already!

The Season 3 box set includes all sorts of extras.  I have been watching the digital copy, which imports directly to iTunes where I can watch via our AppleTV.  I have not yet had a chance to listen to any of the audio commentaries, but I did watch several of the special features, which provide insight into the making of the show.

I would absolutely recommend Game of Thrones Season 3.  The plot builds upon the storylines established in the previous seasons, and there are many surprises.  The acting is phenomenal, the scenery is breathtaking, the costumes are gorgeous everything about Game of Thrones is amazing.  If you have not seen the previous seasons, they are available to HBO subscribers at no cost via the HBO Go app.  Season 3 is also available via HBO Go, but I picked up my own copy so that I could have the audio commentaries and digital copy.  Now that I have rewatched Season 3, I cant wait for Season 4- its going to be a good one!",1393286400,3,5899,4.616346153846154
5707115,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"There are too many uncritical 5 star reviews for this season so I have to chime in.  Just because it's Game of Thrones doesn't earn it an automatic 5 stars. This is mostly just a filler season.  Last year it was interesting to see Cersei show an almost sympathetic side for a minute or two, so this year they try to generate some sympathy for Jamie Lannister and Theon Greyjoy.  Two worthless characters that we hate and rightly so. There can be no redemption for them.  They are bad guys, plain and simple. What's next, sympathy for Joffrey?  I'm sorry, no.  And that's about half of the entire season right there spent on these two non-interesting characters.  Then there's the one thing that really happens that seems random and capricious and desperate on the part of the storytellers. I can just hear them in the writers room: ""We have to do SOMEthing this year!?"" The rest of the characters just go around in circles and nothing really happens for them.  Even the opening theme music seems to be less impressive this season, like they re-recorded it with sparser instrumentation or something to underscore that we're just passing time this season and not really doing anything.  Maybe just my imagination.  But there is no excuse for turning in a half-baked season with 80 percent filler.  I waited a whole year for these ten hours and now I'm just waiting again for another year.  Another season like this and GOT will have officially jumped the dragon!",1393286400,8,1460,4.7047244094488185

The limited edition package isn't the best. It looks good. The construction just isn't great. The top just sits on the base. If you have a pet or kids you will want to keep this out of reach. It doesn't take much to make it tumble. If the top snapped into the base securely it would be much better. The ""durable heavy weight material"" is some kind of plastic, not bad but could have been so much better. Mine wasn't damaged but some people have reported damage to theirs. As it is I don't think I will display it anywhere too open. I wish I had stuck with the best buy version for the case covers. Very disappointed in it.",1393286400,3,657,4.214285714285714

5707126,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I watched this entire season already before the Blu-Ray came out, but I still pre-ordered this immediately for a few reasons

1.) I like buying and promoting things that I love. (Money goes toward the company to keep them making these things, as well as adds to the numbers for the success rating, la la la)

2.) I like to re-watch, obviously, and blu-ray is beautiful

3.) The extra features. They are amazing. More on that right now:

The extra features, so far the only one I have watched was the one on the Red Wedding episode, where they pretty much go through the entire episode scene by scene and talk about it: The production, the reasoning behind things, and even the difference between the book and the show. The author of the books (and creator of this universe as a whole) is also there and is interviewed, as well as the shows producers, set designers, and of course, actors.

Additionally, every episode features commentary, but who is the commentary by? Different people every time! And no, not the producers, but the actors! It's MULTIPLE different actors for different episodes. Some episodes have Sam and Gilly, some have Jon Snow, Ygritte. Some have Daenerys, etc etc. Even Theon's torturer is there.

With amazon (currently) selling this set for only 29.99, there's absolutely no reason to buy this; this bundle is a steal of a deal at 29.99

Buy, Support, Enjoy.
The world goes 'round and everybody is smiley. :)

5707128,5,B00C8CQRQ4,Surprising.  Not sure how this is going to end up.  The writer sure did a job on good characters and especially evil ones as well.  From conquerors to evil witches.  Add Dragons with the mix and ice undead and we got a crowd of adventure with well play tactics of controlling and manipulating the Kings throne.  Warning though there is parts of the show that can be very crude and make me even wince and wish they hadn't put that into the show when it comes to what evil men do and they being sadists.  I thought the warning is very appropriate cause it may be a show you might not want to see though it is very good its very intense and violent.,1393286400,,646,4.169354838709677

But right now we have only a regular DVD player. This set consists of 7 (seven) discs - 5 Blu-ray and 2 conventional DVD. The DVDs are double sided, labeled in very small print, and ONLY contain the 10 (ten) episodes of season 3 of HBO's Game of Thrones.

Beware! NONE of the ""Special Features"" described in this product's description are available on the standard DVDs!

There are NO commentaries by actors, writers, directors, producers. There are NO extra deleted scenes, extra scenes, director's cuts, or anything else. There are NO comments by costumers, armorers, combat coaches, or dragon wranglers! There are no ""making of"", ""behind the scenes"", locations commentaries, or any other such features.

5707136,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"The show is fantastic, with Season 3 the best yet. Can't watch them on my just arrived Blu-rays, however!

While I can't penalize the rating of the show for the issues I have with the Blu-rays (hence the 5 stars), a warning about possible defects with this season's discs may be warranted. The first 3 discs will not play on my current model year Sony Blu-ray player that has its firmware updated. The Sony main menu screen never disappears and the discs just spin and rev for a couple of minutes before I get an error message that the discs cannot be read. As the last two discs DO play (the ""godswood tree"" does appear with those, and fairly quickly) it would appear that the first 3 discs are faulty. None of the disks show any scratches or damage that I can detect. In any case, it does seem odd that more than one disc would be faulty. Hopefully more light can be shed on this by other reviewers, as I see other customer reviews that indicate similar problems with this season's Blu-rays.

As they have superb customer service with an easy exchange process, Amazon is sending out a new set and I hope that this does the trick. If not, then I need to find out how this can be escalated to HBO.

Curious if HBO manufactured a bad batch of discs? If so, I hope Amazon works with HBO expediently to ensure that no more of them get out to their customers.",1393200000,,1355,4.326771653543307

The story is somewhat hard to follow but even a complete novice (like myself) can pick it up in time.  It helps to watch the commentary episodes whenever possible because they sometimes give you a better idea about the story progression.

  [Minor Spoilers Ahead]

PQ: The episodes contained within these disks are ridiculously gorgeous plain and simple.  If you thought the broadcast versions (or pirated 720p ones) were good looking just wait until you see the blu-ray video quality.  The lighting is absolutely fantastic, in particular some of the darker scenes are absolutely amazing (especially the ones using fire as the main light source).  Speaking of dark scenes there are quite a few of them this season, and luckily the black levels are spot on.  As with previous seasons the locations shot on this show are some of the most beautiful you will ever see, and will look stunning on your big TV.  The sets and costumes have always looked amazing on Game of Thrones, but this season they really outdid themselves.  Not that it needs to be said but the use of GC is excellent this season, nothing new here

Some scenes to showcase picture quality
-Anything involving the wall
-Beric vs. Clegane
-Dannys parley with Yunkai
-Garden scenes in kings landing
-Anything in Geoffrys/Cercies/Tyrions chambers

AQ: My god this is an impressive DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack.  Hard to say if it's better than the previous two seasons, but I do think that season 3 had more chances to fully utilize what a modern home theater system can produce.  Excellent use of surrounds and LFE channel.  Most importantly the dialog is always given a priority in the mixing which makes it very clear and easy to understand.  Top it all off with the incredible soundtrack (gotta love Rains of Castamere) and you have something very incredible indeed.

Some scenes to showcase audio quality
-Climbing the Wall
-Summer snarling at Jojen
-Beric vs. Clegane
-Most Dragon scenes
-Sam and Gilly at the weirwood

Packaging:  Pretty much the same as previous two seasons.  Case is white instead of black and the slip cover is made of plastic.  I like this because my cardboard covers always get frayed around the corners after extended use.  DVD copies look like they might be hard to remove from there sleeve without scratching, but I haven't tried myself.

As a final note the extras are phenomenal for season 3. My favorites are:
-Making of ""The Rains of Castamere""
-Histories and lore
-Deleted scene: Tywin and Pycelle",1393200000,,2425,4.901719901719901

The loading time it absolutely horrendous.  I thought my player was on the blink when I first loaded the DVD.  Loading the third episode which they don't tell you is on the third disk (but it appears as if it's on the 2nd disk) is even more time consuming. Made me wish I did not buy an ""official"" copy.  A pirated DVD would probably have loaded a lot faster.  There is so much nonsense on the DVDs that it begs the patience of a saint.
WHY ARE THEY SOOOOOOOO SLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOWWWWW?????
Makes no sense.  This is 2014 and the dvd's play like the worse VCRs of the 1980's.

5707181,1,B00C8CQRQ4,"After having watched all three season, I found season 3 quite disturbing mostly because it depicts how the majority of humans are. I like to see the good guys win a round every once in awhile. If you are into S&M, evil and witchcraft--then this series is your ""huckleberry.""

The writers had way too many sub-plots going on in each segment and even if you have watched all the prior seasons, it is very difficult to follow the plots and why one person is doing what they are to another (It's like a group of 8th grade girl's ganging up in each other) --if it this is your first season you will be totally lost as to the plot. On top of that confusion--the writers add even more characters.

There are so many evil disgusting characters, it is as if the writers are trying to outdo each other in whose character is the worst.

There was absolutely no reason to torture, in the most cruel of ways, one of the main characters--it had no purpose except to feed the S&M crowd.

I watched the complete season waiting for just one good , decent character to emerge and the closest the writers came was to the dragon queen.

Would not even run on my custom built computer (less than 1 year old) until I -bought- a brand new piece of software. No free programs have kept up with this. DRM is going too far here.  I am all for protecting copyright, but if I paid for it and still can't watch it with the hardware that worked just last month, I'm going to get pissed.

The DVDs came in a cardboard sleeve, stuck to it with an adhesive that gummed up the disks, meaning that while playing the second side of both of them I encountered damaged areas I was forced to skip past. The minutes lost amounted to around 6 or 7 total, which is an eternity in a show this intricate.

Not to mention the fact that I've been waiting with excitement for a year to watch this. I don't have HBO, I wanted to get it through legitimate channels and I was patient until it came out on DVD. I shouldn't have the experience marred by issues with brand new DVDs.

So kudos to the creators of the show and all the cast and crew involved. It was as epic as I expected it to be, and I could honestly not praise it higher. But for the love of the seven gods use some common sense on your packaging.",1393113600,,1006,4.070707070707071

I've read all the books and re-watch the previous seasons throughout the year to hold me over as I do not have HBO. When the new seasons are released, it's very difficult to avoid binge-watching marathons! This is the greatest masterpiece on television, and is so much better than most theatre-released movies that I would compare it to epic films such as my favorite Lord of the Rings trilogy and Hobbit films. Each episode leaves you itching for more, it's just pure escapism and has the greatest characters. I just got my Blu-ray season 3 and began watching today. It's the first season I own on Blu-Ray and it's exquisite. The discs are acting a bit strange, taking a long time to load and the second disc wouldn't start, but after I turned the player off and on again it worked. Hopefully this is not enough to have to warrant an exchange, but just an issue I found worth mentioning. There's tons of special features I haven't even begun to watch yet, but the price for the collection is amazing and I'm so thrilled to have brand new shows again that I know I will enjoy forever.

The actors have brought the characters to life with exceptional skill and talent.  Some questions and explanations which were not answered or fleshed out in the books are done so here with skill.  The locations are perfectly chosen and the directing was inspired.  As a lover of dragons I am happy they are presented as beautiful, but fierce animals and not demonized.  The price for the third season is also much lower than the first two when they were released and not much more than Blu-Ray/DVD's.  Great entertainment at a great price.  Two thumbs up!",1393027200,,714,4.611111111111111

The actors do a very good job of playing their characters and the costumes and props are very well done.  The Blu Ray version is nice as you get the regular DVDs as well as the digital copy.

I was really surprised at the size of this and the lifelike stone look to the case. This edition includes the complete 3rd season in incredible Blu-Ray and has a digital copy for your mobile devices or for Ultra Violet storage. It also has a special disc with an in-depth look at Episode 9 , ""The Rains of Castamere"" and a lot of other special features that we have not even explored yet. If you are a fan of this series, this is the edition to buy. It's worth every extra dollar that it cost compared to the regular 3rd season and I think it has way more special features and content.

It is an incredible looking statue and we get a lot of complements on it from our friends. They really like the case and we do as well. It's very sturdy and stable and it set on the top of our Sanus entertainment center near our other special editions of other series.

5707216,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"Just an absolutely crazy season! My jaw is still on the floor. Practically every episode feels like a season finale there is just so much insane stuff happening throughout and it barely ever lets up. While the first two seasons were great as well, I don't think they will prepare you for everything going on here and they will feel relatively tame by comparison. The creators have really upped the ante and not necessarily through more graphic sex and violence. The acting and dialogue are on a different level this season especially with Tywin Lannister, Charles Dance OWNS this season along with lots of great new characters with some familiar faces if you've seen films like There Will Be Blood, the remake of The Thing, The Dark Knight Rises, Pacific Rim, or Richard Ayoade's (The IT Crowd, The Watch) film Submarine. This season also gets better special effects with the growing dragons and a sword fight that looks like something from a Star Wars movie. You can't miss with this season, too good. Season four has a lot to live up to. As far as the books go I'm only halfway through A Clash of Kings, the second book, but it seems like there are elements still from that book in this season, Bran Stark's scenes in particular, so I don't think the seasons match up with the book number. Hopefully that means we'll get more TV seasons than there are books. As far as the Blu-rays go I only had one issue where the ""Rains of Castamere"" episode on disc four froze for a second or two, but otherwise the whole season ran great on my PS3 Slim.",1392940800,,1543,4.534050179211469

5707237,2,B00C8CQRQ4,The first two seasons I paid for are available to watch digitally via amazon.  HBO does not give amazon as an option any longer.

5707239,3,B00C8CQRQ4,"To put it bluntly, the fundamental problem of the books and the video is the extraordinary fragmentation of the story.  There are far too many characters and far too many events in the story, characters dying almost arbitrarily and new characters being introduced almost andomly, to keep track of any presumption of a story line.  Seriously, as much as I love the various characters in the story, their deaths/rebirths/introductions as new characters in the plot, could drive any person with even a genius IQ absolutely nuts...

Anyone trying to follow the plot MUST - absolutely MUST - read both the books and watch the HBO translation of the books into video.  No disrespect to George R.R. Martin, as an author myself who understands the difficulties he faces in writing this story, the story is GROSSLY fragmented... primarily because the story is about the GAME OF THRONES, not about any character or group of characters, and that does not come out very strongly in the written story... and largely because - I suspect - some idiot MBAs somewhere are pushing the author to stretch the story out beyond anything reasonable (I've dealt personally with idiot MBAs running publishing shops, so my sympathies extend to George R.R. Martin).

I have to give credit to the producers and writers for HBO; it is extraordinary how they've translated the books into video.  I (personally) could listen all day to the musical score, and I find the story line ( in video) to be astounding, although he way the jump from event to event would drive me nuts if I hadn't also read the books.

I do not, however, find the books' story line to be anywere as enthralling as the video...  As a writer myself (under a pseudonym),  I understand George R. R. Martin's difficulty in  handling so many different  characters dispersed across so may different areas in the story (he personally makes note of the problems himself in Book 2 and at the end of Book 4), but rationalizations for a problem do not eliminate the problem.  I give  him credit for acknowledging the difficulty...  Personally, I  think he should have made much more emphasis of the fact that the story is about the GAME OF THRONES, not about individual characters or familes of characters...

I'm not going to tap dance around this too much; I enjoy the videos much more than the books... but I have allready read the books before I have ever looked at the videos.  I don't think they are capable of standing alone... I susect people who only read the books or only see the videos are left confused.

It is unfortunate; in combination, it is an extraorinary story... and poor George R.R. Martin must be going insane trying to keep everything straight...  There are just so many characters and so many subplots...

The actors are magnificent; the show's writers are magnificent... without them, the books fall flat.

5707277,2,B00C8CQRQ4,"Hello Amazon,

Note: This review pertains only to the limited edition bonus mantel, not to the actual television series.

Amazon has certainly posted a hyped-up review of this limited edition bonus mantel, and I almost turned into the ""Mad King"" Aerys II Targaryen while waiting for it to arrive on my doorstep. The packaging fed into my hysteria, unfortunately, as it arrived in a ridiculously over-sized box, which contained the smaller box that housed the actual item. After ravaging the packaging with tooth and claw, I couldn't have been more disappointed with the actual mantel, which drove me into a double madness and led to the review you see before you.

Amazon informs you that the mantel is ""created in durable heavy weight material,"" is ""highly textured,"" and is ""finished with a weathered look evoking the feel of Westeros and a bygone era."" Yes, the ""bygone era"" of sound craftsmanship - not of Westeros. The ""durable heavy weight material,"" while looking sleek from a great distance, is cheap plastic and not ""heavy weight material"" whatsoever. Although the wings of the dragon are done well, albeit extremely fragile, the dragon's face, upon closer inspection, is completely lacking in texture and rather looks like a kindergarten Play-Doh project. With my mantel, the eyes are lacking any coloring (which gives the impression that this dragon is eyeless), and there are two or thee randomly placed teeth jutting uncannily from its mouth. Even worse is the fact that the Game of Thrones logo seems hurriedly painted (and smudged) in more than one place.

If you ""make room on your mantel for this one-of-a-kind packaging"" a small breeze, let alone a strong wind of winter, will knock the top off of the base, as the hidden compartment which houses the complete third season has no locking mechanism for the base/mantel whatsoever.

""With a wink to fans, the back is engraved with ""Dracarys"", a word from the Valyrian language playing homage to wildfires and dragons."" That wink is all you will receive in terms of ""homage,"" unfortunately, unless you are a diehard collector of Game of Thrones collectibles. To be fair, it is quite difficult to justify an additional $60.00 for this mantel over the cost of the standard Blu-ray/DVD/Digital edition.

Although I highly doubt G.R.R. Martin would be pleased with this product, the best part of this limited edition is, of course, the enchanting television program. I hope this review helps fans seeking the bonus. Game on!",1392768000,87,2485,5.019417475728155

Tyrion and Bronn are in fine form, Daenerys starts to show her strengths, Arya and the Hound galavant around the Riverlands, and Jaime and Brienne have some very fine moments together. Which is to say nothing of the Red Wedding, one of the greatest treatments of any scene from the book so far.

BUT, this is also my favorite box set. The slipcover with the semi-opaque dragon on it is a nice touch, and once again we get the DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital download. Amazon also lowered the price to $29.99, which makes this set an incredible value. The featurettes are also a nice inclusion, although they are nothing particularly earth-shattering if you kept up with extras on HBO's on-demand service. Still, this is a good treatment for the series' best-yet season. And at less than $30, it's a heck of a deal.",1392768000,,848,4.653333333333333

5707284,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"First of all its a great show. I've read the books (book 3, on which this season was based, was absolutely superb, one of the best books I've ever read actually) but I think this would be very good indeed even if you had not read the books?

The dvd extras are very good - I particularly enjoyed the commentary of Richard Madden (Robb) & Michelle Fairly (Catelyn)'s on the Rains episode. Nice to have a few extended/deleted scenes, particularly one with Jon meeting Mance Rayder; another with Tywin meeting up with Pycelle isn't much cop, can see why they left that out; Tywin is best sparring with his son

The 15 minute video synopsis of the previous season is very VERY useful as there really is so much going on. A close watcher of the show might not remember that Bran & Rickon are presumed dead, that Littlefinger misled Catelyn into thinking BOTH her daughters were still held at Kings Landing

Actually, it might be a good idea, if you have NOT read the books to watch the previous seasons, to get you up to speed.

Nice touches: Ned being mentioned in the penultimate episode of the season. Its easy to forget how important his character was to the show, and how all the chaos unfolding is out of his unfair treatment by Joffrey back in season 1

Minor characters (like Roose Bolton, introduced in season 2) become crucial to the plot, and the attention to detail is crucial, especially if you've read the books. And that's another thing - the show is clearly done by fans of the book. There are no major changes to the book. Robb's wife gets a name change, and Arya meets with Tywin back in season 2 (as did NOT happen in the books) but theres nothing major. The author (Martin) writes for the show for an episode a season, and its clear that the show is following the book very closely. (Martin has a commentary on his Bear & the Maiden Fair also)

The casting: spot on. Mance is as you remember him from the book. Hey! I LIKE the guy

In my opinion, the book helps if you watch the show, filling everything out (as it were) so you might want to pick them up at some point

But the show is a can't miss, really. Season 3 is absolutely superb, winter is coming. Not near enough of the White Walkers as you could wish, but the threat is there. Can't wait to see season 4 and Tyrion getting a bit of his own back against his father!

(Season 4 will be based on book 3 also. Its a massive book but well worth the read. You might want to pick it up if you want to swim in it for a while!",1392768000,32,2493,4.264830508474576

Twice...And the people of Britan have been perusing the material on this video all year, so please forgive me as I comment on things that some people might not know about. Like the guy on the news lately that was lost at sea for a year. He will definitely be shocked! But the story is just so huge I can't really imagine someone whom hasn't at least a clue as to the forthcoming horror/shock! AND several (such as myself) whom are still in denial. It can't be true; The Red Wedding..every body dies!?!? It still blows my mind! I find myself lost in this magical Kingdom that George R.R.Martin has created every time I watch or read the story as it goes along. I feel as if I belong there! I want to fight with Robb, I wanted to behead Walder Frey! I'm still shocked over my own inner viciousness about that. I wanted to walk the wall with John Snow (whom I surmise will be king of all Westeros in the end)....is that love blossoming between The king slayer Jamie, and his lady (warden/defender) night Briann?  And I want to personally choke King Joffrey. And I wanted to be the one to push Lysa Arryn out of the Eyrie! And toss her weird mammary fixated brat out immediately after! That's right! I said it! And you all know that you did too! Don't lie! Lol. And I was completely convinced that when Eddard Stark was beheaded (in the very first season no less!!) That the story would quickly  become unraveled. I thought Martin completely MAD! And then, he kills off half the main catchers!! I thought that was surely the end and the story would Peter out. The shocking ending to this third book is just unbelievable! But the story keeps going, and growing, and spreading! It's like nothing I've ever read before. And I can't wait for the next Book that's coming out?!What about Arya!? Does she become an assassin!? What about Sansa and Little finger!?  When is Daenerys Targaryen and her Dragons going to set this Game of Thrones on fire!? And when/how is Tyrions' voyage going to be put in there?
  Ahhh. But we'll all have to wait for those answers.
  I absolutely can't wait to see how Martin brings all this together in the next book! Now that I have vented, here is the serious truth...

I was so excited to see this exclusive limited edition set on Amazon. I couldn't wait to open it and add this to my shelf. It says in the description ""Created in durable heavy weight material"". It is not or I got the wrong thing. It looks just like the picture but it feels like cheap flimsy plastic. It doesn't connect into the base to give it some stability. If you aren't extremely careful it will fall off the base. I've tried to ""lock it in place"" but there isn't any way to do so, and I'm afraid that if I push too hard it will break in my hands. Alot of money for plastic. Also, the ""hidden compartment"" was almost impossible to get the movies out of. It's a very tight fit and I thought maybe with the movies in the statue part it will connect to the base better. Nope it doesn't. The prongs on the statue that fit into the base are also very flimsy and feel like they can easily be broken off. They really don't do any good anyway since they don't hold the pieces tightly together. If they are going to make something like this then it should connect together tightly. The slightest movement can send the statue part off the base and onto the floor.

Review: As far as the series itself goes it is exceptional fantasy world drama about a time before medieval ages when magic and dragons existed.  Exceptional production values, writing, directing, acting, F/X, stunts, choreography, music, sets, scenery, and everything else is top notch.

5707326,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I am so confused by some of the reviews that seem to suggest that this season was just ""meh."" What show were you watching!? If you complain about it not being faithful enough to the books...I challenge you to do a better job writing a script, these books are damn near unfilmable because of the size, scope, and huge cast of characters. It is not the books, it is a television adaption, and a damn fine one at that. Now if you are complaining about the Red Wedding...seriously, grow a pair. The point of this show is to feel gritty, real, and unpredictable. If you didn't like that twist, why are you watching GoT in the first place? This show will kick you in the nuts, and keep kicking you while you're down, but that's what makes the triumphant moments so rewarding. Now, with that out of the way: Excellent season, great character arcs, (Jaimie, Robb, Jon Snow, and Daenerys' were my personal favorites) and some truly epic moments. Seeing Khaleesi grow as a leader was awesome (and THE DRAGONS. The dragons look better than most major Hollywood CGI creations), and the romance between Jon and Ygritte was so good! Jaime is brilliantly complex. And Robb's story...well just you wait. Overall, continues the epic (but for adults only) saga of blood, sex, betrayal, love, and politics. PLEASE FINISH THIS ONE GOOD GRRM, you are so close to pulling off one of the greatest fantasy sagas of all time.

Yet, it comes at a time where the audience is accustomed to the epic and breathtaking vfx of blockbuster movies like the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit... Game of thrones promises more than it can deliver in the aspect of visuals. It is still imprisoned in a tv-budget after all. My other major point is the adult content. The sexual scenes are distracting, gratuitous and unnecessary. At a time when anyone seeking porn can watch it free on the internet, why a tv show keeps devoting time to sexual explicit scenes? The perverts already have plenty of means to satisfy their impulses away from paid cable... so lets focus on the drama and the characters, please!

By not releasing their content to anyone but cable TV subscribers HBO is giving most 20 and 30 something year old's only one option: illegally download Game of Thrones as it comes out because HBO will not allow internet users a legal means of accessing the content until it is all played out, talked about, literally a year after it aired on TV.

I post this on Amazon because I always buy Game of Thrones seasons on Amazon as soon as it's available.  There is just no reason why it should take SOO long.  Amazon please convince HBO that they have a huge untapped customer base here in your video streaming service.

5707343,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"When it comes to premium cable, my worlds shift as the year goes on. For thirteen weeks in the fall, I get Showtime to watch HOMELAND and one of the best new shows on cable, MASTERS OF SEX. But for the rest of the year, I go back to HBO, and while there are many other good and compelling shows on that channel, such as THE NEWSROOM, and less so, TRUE BLOOD, the main reason I keep coming back is for GAME OF THRONES. And Season Three was perhaps the ultimate lesson as to why this show keeps you coming back. I've reviewed all of the seasons here, and while I found the first season a little problematic but really good overall, the second season was even better, and it just keeps improving into this season.

It's hard to distill everything that happens in this season, and all the new characters and threats that are introduced, so I'll try to distill it in what I believe are the best moments. Daenerys Targaryen meeting The Unsullied, and her trek in defiance of a ""man's world"" is so vital, so strong and never gets stale. Bran meeting Jojen Reed to make sense of what he's becoming as a warg starts slow but builds extremely well. Jon Snow and Ygritte's relationship and Jon's ""undercover"" work with Mance Rayder's men is always compelling and suspenseful. The conflict that comes to a head between the Night's Watch and Craster. The initially antagonistic relationship between Jaime and Brienne comes into sharper focus as they warm up to each other. The plight of Davos and his friendship with Stannis conflicting with the intentions of Melisandre. The wedding of Tyrion and Sansa and the rift that creates with Shae. The interminable cruelty of Joffrey, and how he keeps getting figuratively spanked by Tywin. The Brotherhood Without Banners and the firey combat between The Hound and Beric. The women of the Tyrell family, particularly Olenna. The bear pit. The end of Astapor.

And then, of course, The Red Wedding.

I know that of everything that has happened in this season, the most talked-about event is the Red Wedding, and while there are many other important things happening, the episode ""The Rains of Castamere"" is a horrific, tragic and emotionally devastating event that, for people who are merely fans of the show and not of George R.R. Martin's epic novels like myself, seemed to come out of nowhere, but going back, you can see it coming with hindsight. It firmly establishes the brutally pragmatic machinations of Twyin and his exploitation of the personal slights felt by Roose Bolton and Walder Frey. Although, while the twists and turns of the Lannisters prove to have the most meat on them, the heart of the season stands firmly with Daenerys. She proves to be not only a brilliant strategist, but a leader that could rule with a merciful and generous heart. The soul of the show belongs to Jon Snow, a young man so clearly over his head in a situation that will force him to question his loyalties and his oath to the Night's Watch, making him the stand-in for the audience.

As usual, everyone in the show is pretty amazing, but most surprising of all is the turn from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister. It took a while for the audience to connect with him, particularly when his first significant deed of the show was to push Bran out of a window. But this season, more layers of the onion are peeled back to show that there is much more to him than what we've seen before, which makes me very happy since his was the character that I couldn't get with at all for quite some time. Emilia Clarke continues to amaze with her performance as the Mother of Dragons, and Charles Dance totally owns you (and everyone else around him) as Tywin Lannister. Wisely, the show decided to show much more of what was going on around the kingdoms, and not to devote too much focus to the conflict between the Starks and Lannisters.

So bring on the White Walkers. Winter is coming and I'm ready.

At least, I hope I'm ready.",1387584000,267,3950,4.611664295874823
5707344,5,B00C8CQRQ4,"I think that some people are confused about the pricing...  The list price for the regular edition (Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy) - not the limited edition - is actually the same as Seasons 1 & 2.  The discounted price for the first two seasons compared to the 3rd season is typical of most tv shows when there is an upcoming release...  If you want the limited edition, you'll pay more, but you can still get the regular edition for a reasonable cost.
As for the actual show, I have the 1st and 2nd seasons, and love how they were done.  I have not seen the 3rd season; I've only read the books, so I can't say much about it just yet.  I'm looking forward to it, but not looking forward to it, if you know what I mean...

What want to comment on is the packaging for the Game of Thrones Season 3 Limited Edition. Does anyone know more about it? Have they done these ""Amazon exclusives"" before and do any other retrailers have their own special packaging? I've gotten some of the Walking Dead Limited Ed Special packages....but this dragon is pretty underwhelming from the photo. Is there going to be anything better out there? Also, since it's a ""limited"" edition, I'd love to know HOW LIMITED. They aren't numbered...so will they just print to order...or does someone know how many of these will be produced. Who produced the mold for this packaging? At least the folks who do the Walking Dead releases have told us that it's done by Todd McFarland's toy company, which has pretty high standards in my experience. I hate paying a premium for this realease and then finding there is a nicer Limited Edtion exclusive produced by Best Buy or Target!

Most stories have a beginning, a middle and an end, but I get the sense that this story will never end.  I have read that at its current pace show will pass the books by season 6 or season 7, if that happens the show will continue on its own until it reaches the conclusion of the story.  Seven seasons is a very long time let alone going beyond that.

I have watched all 30 episodes over the past couple of weeks, a great way to watch a series in my opinion. I've never been one for watching a series of this type week by week, but to get to the conclusion I guess I will have to start or wait several years for it to finish.

It has been an entertaining show thus far, I find many of the characters interesting and some have redeeming qualities but most of those characters are now dead. At first the shock value of killing off many of the characters that have any compassion or decency was intriguing, but now seems more like a cheap writers ploy to rid the story of an abundance of story lines.

The cinematography and most of the acting, is done quite well but it could have been done just as well without all the gratuitous sex and violence. Dismemberment, rape, murder, incest, human sacrifice, torture, gay sex,  all seem forced and not altogether necessary.  All and all a good show. Can't wait to see which characters I enjoy get killed next.",1385337600,11,1366,4.3125
5707349,2,B00C8CQRQ4,"HBO made it too commercial, too porney, and too divergent from the book.  Moments lost, clarity askew, and higher purpose forgotten.  There are a few excellent performances, maybe one that is exemplary.  Consequences are present (should not a good man behaving foolishly suffer the fate of a fool) and one's family is frequently not a source of deep wisdom.  Hard lessons, in a hard world where there is little comfort from faith, only advantage.  It is worth a watch just to see that the privilege of power is not free and that at times the cost is the iron price.",1384905600,13,565,4.61
