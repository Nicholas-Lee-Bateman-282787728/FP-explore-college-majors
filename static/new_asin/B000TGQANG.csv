Its clear instructions, excellent photography and teaching methods are to be admired. If you want to learn how to use this simple yet effective self defence weapon in a relitivly short time this DVD set will give you a good grounding in all aspects, having seen a few cane DVDs this set is realy hard to beat. Get it, enjoy it, learn from it and walk out with confidence remeber the old japanese saying ""the sparrow never lands where the tiger walks"" so go on be a tiger!!!",1288483200,8,578,4.3119266055045875

8209186,5,B000TGQANG,"At this point I can honestly say that I have watched nearly every DVD on cane fighting techniques and all of them have been lacking in one of the most basic problems with cane fighting: what do you do when your opponent grabs your cane?  There are very few DVDs that even consider it to be something that could happen.  I can guarantee that it WILL happen.  Having spent more than 40 years training in the martial arts, and having had too much experience in street and barroom brawls, I will state categorically that if you have any kind of weapon, your opponent will try to get it away from you.  These two DVDs cover a wealth of techniques, from simple to not so simple, that allow you to hold onto your cane, and even what to do if you cannot immediately get it back.  Defenses against grabs, chokes, locks, throws, grappling, kicks, headlocks....it's all here.

For those who are into classical Hapkido, there's not much here.  But all of the techniques can be traced back to basic Hapkido principles.  The techniques are very practical and you always have a choice of techniques to work from.  If you're older...as I am....or medically limited, there is always something here for you.  It can be as simple or as difficult as you want to make it.  The emphesis is generally on simple and short.  The nature of street attacks being what they are, simpler is pretty much always going to be preferable when you're having to deal with a surprise attack and the adrenal dump that usually kicks in almost immediately.  These DVDs are absolutely aimed at being useful and not amazingly fancy and beautiful.  So if you're looking for something that will make you look like the ancient blind master with his quarter staff or bo, keep looking.  If you'd like to make it home alive and with all your parts intact, look no further; this is the DVD you need.  Just get a sturdy hardwood cane...hickory is a good choice.  Canemasters makes a variety of very decent canes...and stay away from the super cheap rattan, so-called ""self defense"" canes that you find on Amazon, Ebay and elsewhere.  They don't hold up and I would not trust them not to break in a serious situation.

I cannot recommend this DVD too highly.  It's simply the best out there.",1398556800,6,2239,4.591939546599496
8209187,5,B000TGQANG,"There are many canes on the market made for combat nowadays, and many of them come with a Combat price. Many of the people teaching how to use a cane for self-defense cash in by teaching techniques specific to such canes. That way the make one ""need"" such canes for training and defense. That is NOT done here. Many of the techniques taught from the very beginning here are adaptable to a simple cane bought from the local pharmacy or Walmart.
There is enough blocks and defense on the first disc to defend oneself with any simple cane from most punches and kicks that may come, But for those of us who know blocks from other styles of martial arts, these blocks and defenses can be adapted to a simple broomstick of just one's own hands. And the techniques are shown and explained so that anyone who can follow any directions can learn and master them. It is suggested from the beginning that these techniques only be practiced under the guidance of a qualified instructor, because some of these techniques are dangerous and can result in serious harm or worse if misused. In an ideal world, we would all practice our techniques with a qualified instructor. But with the many who now concentrate on our money and long-term contracts rather than teaching us, who's to say? As stated earlier here, these techniques can be learned easily, but unless practiced slowly and with great care, they can wipe out training partners quickly.
As for the second disc, there are some techniques that one needs a cane with a bigger crook to practice. But I would just consider those extra. All in all, there are enough techniques in these two discs that can be adapted to a simple cane, a broomstick or an umbrella that make these discs well worth the investment. And a word to the wise about the sellers. If considering these videos, you may want to check all your buying options as well. Some sellers sell for less, and their service is just as good.",1394582400,4,1937,4.601156069364162
8209188,5,B000TGQANG,"I'm still watching this, but as an instructional video, it is put together quite well.  Techniques are explained concisely and filmed in a way that is useful.",1392336000,2,158,4.851851851851852
8209189,5,B000TGQANG,"This set is a treasure of cane techniques for the martial artist. The moves are well explained, shown in many views and in slow motion. The production quality is top notch too. The most helpful to me are the escape techniques when an antagonist is grabbing me or my cane. This alone is worth the price for me.

I am a 58 year old man who uses his cane for steadiness and support. My reactions times and coordination are not what they used to be and these limit my use of many techniques. Also, some of the techniques could result in legal battles as we are warned of in the prologue and throughout the lessons.

If you are a martial artist who uses a cane you should find a lot to use in this DVD set. If you are an untrained elderly you should still be able to find much useful material here that may not be found elsewhere.",1361059200,7,825,4.182389937106918
8209190,3,B000TGQANG,"I had several issues with it. The one that was the most annoying, it would not play on windows media player. I have access to many versions of windows and Mac products on many different computers.
I got it to play but it wasn't an easy plug and play. My old DVD player would not play it on my TV set. The information is good.",1326067200,,325,4.015384615384615
