8516778,2,B007HO8GZI,"The packaging says this product includes the original French version, which is FAR better (even if you're depending on the subtitles) than the English version because the voices are much more expressive. I always love Morgan Freeman, but his voice over converts this film into something more like a regular nature documentary. The French version includes men, women and children's voices and comes over as an astonishingly beautiful art film, conveying with subtle grace the impression of sharing the POVs of the actual male, female and baby penguins. It's the French version that won the big international awards. But it's not available on TV where I am, so I thought I'd invest in the French version on disk to share with family who'd only seen the English version and didn't know how great the original was. After carefully reading all the blurbs on the available formats I bought this one. But there was no French version when I put the DVD into the player! So I wasted my money. I gave it two stars because while you still get the lovely film, which even in English is worth far more than two stars, you can get the English version on line and the whole point of this edition is to provide the French version as well and it doesn't. False advertising. Please fix, Amazon, and do provide the French version somehow.",1512172800,3,1319,4.714285714285714
