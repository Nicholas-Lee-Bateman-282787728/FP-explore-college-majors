1350681,4,B00004TJMR,I first watched this video when I was little.  I used to spend hours in front of the TV watching it over and over again.  This video is filled with song and dance numbers to your favorite Mother Goose nursery rhyme.  It  engages the child to sing along with all the fun lovable characters.  This  is a great video for children.,961891200,10,327,4.278688524590164

1350685,4,B00004TJMR,"My son LOOOOVES these movies. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is the picture quality isn't very good, but that's probably because they are old and were transfers from VHS to DVD and back then didn't have HD.

It hurts my eyes after watching it for some time as it is blurry. I wonder if there's a way they can ""clean"" it up.",1493856000,,333,4.045454545454546

My daughter was thrilled and immediately put the DVD in. The best part was when my father, who has Alzheimer's disease heard the first 6 notes of the song and he said, ""Oh my gosh.

1350719,5,B00004TJMR,"""Mother Goose stories, and Mother Goose rhymes, make magical memories and wonderful times!"" I grew up on these Mother Goose Treasury videos, only they were on VHS. I knew all of the rhymes and all of the songs on both Volume I and II. And when I had kids of my own, I wished so much that they still made videos for kids like the ones we grew up with... simple, no glitz and glamour, easy to follow, and fun. I looked for awhile for these on DVD and was SO excited to finally find them on Amazon! I bought this one for my son for his birthday and we watched it on a recent road trip - and the kids (3 and 6) wanted to watch it twice! They loved it just as much as I did, and while driving I found myself singing along to all of the songs from my own childhood. Strangely nostalgic and oh so fun to share with my own kids.

These videos are simple. They have puppets and live actors. (Think Sesame Street type show). They aren't super high quality or fancy, but they are fun and have great, catchy tunes. Enough so that after probably 20+ years of not watching them, the first time I heard it play, I remembered the words! I highly recommend these videos to anyone with small kids. They have become a favorite in our home and I am SO glad! I would much rather my kids want to watch this over and over than something like SpongeBob. :)",1461801600,4,1332,4.103448275862069

We received it today and watched it.  She loved it!

The second volume is not as good as the first. It uses the wrong homonyms when showing the words on the screen. Also, words to one rhyme remain on the screen when there is dialogue between some of the characters.
The rhymes are cute as are the characters. My twenty-one month old granddaughter burst out laughing when she saw ""The Little Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe."" Also, when she watches the video, we give her a book of rhymes to hold, and we point to the rhyme in the book that corresponds to what is on the screen.

1350788,3,B00004TJMR,"I'm sure little children will enjoy the dvd. Unfortunately, this is not the Mother Goose Treasury I thought I was ordering. I wanted the video that was sold by Avon around 1987/1989.  I loved that my children loved them and often watched with them. The difference is Avon's video Mother Goose was always holding Gertrude (the goose), and this Gertrude is a large goose, even taller than Mother Goose. This Gertrude walks around separately or with the characters. The singing, music and acting is just ok. Then again, young children will probably like this dvd and sing along.

I'm disappointed with this. Had there been a video clip to watch, I would've known this wasn't the one I wanted. Still, as stated earlier, young children
(toddlers) will enjoy it.

I received it quickly and it was packed well. I have no complaints about the seller.",1405209600,,842,4.793103448275862

I used to watch these every day and I knew all the songs and rhymes. I think learning nursery rhymes helps teach kids memorization which is important in school when learning multiplication tables and things like that.

We bought Vol 1 and Vol 2. So far we've only watched one volume. While I was watching it I was remembering some of the songs and its so weird that I remember them from so long ago. My husband had these videos as a kid too and he was also laughing because he remembered some of the songs too.

The DVD is super cheesy and not made with the latest in special effects technology. But its fun and goofy and kids love that kind of stuff. The costumes in particular are hilarious. One of the main characters is a giant talking, honking goose. Its ridiculous fun, perfect for kids. I enjoy watching it with my daughter since I look back and think, ""I can't believe this was my favorite video!""

I had forgotten all about it till one day i was looking for some dvd's for my kids and came across and bought it immediatly. My 3 year old loves it, and it is the only dvd he actually acts out and sings with them. He even started doing the alphabet after he was watching this movie. He was never a fan sesame street, but this movies he loves, and I definatly believe because it is the overacting and he can understand better.
  I think this DVD is perfect for children. It tells all the nursery rhymes and stories you remember from your childhood, and introduces in them in a fun way for kids. I think the most important thing is how this dvd is set up for children. Of course to an adult the puppets look fake and the scenery you can tell is not real. Give it a break it is from the 1980's, you can't expect it to look like things do now. But kids don't pay attention to this at all, and don't know. This DVD was made for kids not adults. Also kids always love overacting and being silly. This is the reason I think this dvd is perfect for them. I mean how many times will a kid watch something that's serious without some fun in it and overacting.
The only thing I find is the cast mostly is too old for the parts there they're playing, but i believe the reason is because they wanted to make sure they had good singing in the movie.
  Very simple if your looking for something for your children to watch and enjoy singing and nursery ryhmes then this is it. If your looking something for yourself just then of course i wouldn't recommend this.",1219104000,2,1678,4.1067073170731705
1350855,5,B00004TJMR,"The couple of lengthy critics are twisted people projecting new age hippie values on your children.  This series creates a beautiful, truly well-performed, not talking-down-to and WHOLESOME fantasy for kids, so they can be kids and not miniature politically correct adults.  It's a tragedy people like those naysayers exist.  At least the more mature, wiser reviewers get it.

What's so special is they have well-schooled dancers or actors and they perform the verses that are not well-known.  I just re-viewed them with my daughter who is now almost 12, and we truly enjoyed them as vivid  high-caliber children's theater, quite apart from the nostalgic of having watched them together 10 yrs ago.  And the goose character really moves like a goose, truly well-done.  The honk-honk is cute, fits the part,  and NOT overdone.",1215216000,2,825,5.142857142857143
1350856,5,B00004TJMR,"My 3 children experienced and loved the Mother Goose video in VHS form.  I was so happy to find this in DVD form so my little granddaughter could have this experience as well.

1350857,3,B00004TJMR,"I remember this when I was young and HAD to watch it with my younger brother and sister. For some reason the title song to this collection always stuck in my head. So when I had a child of my own (she's 2) I decided to track down the Mother Goose I remember. I cannot believe I found this on DVD! My daughter absolutely LOVES these 2 dvd's. Best purchase I ever made for her. She's entertained, she loves Humpty Dumpty, she loves all the singing and she get's up and dances with the songs! I agree that the cinematography is horrible and the actors aren't so wonderful, but I remember my bro and sis loving it...and NOW MY DAUGHTER ADORES IT! I wish I could find volumes III and IV on DVD!!!!",1208304000,9,692,4.2105263157894735

He is not much of a video watcher at 2, since he seems to busy for tv, however there's something about this collection of Mother Goose ryhmes that he really connects with.  So I would give this video 2 thumbs up!",1208131200,4,340,4.044776119402985
1350859,5,B00004TJMR,This series is well done musically and the performances are all clever and entertaining for your pre-school/kindergarten audience. The video is very professional with the feel of a lavish production of years gone by.,1199491200,3,216,5.382352941176471
1350860,5,B00004TJMR,"I have read some of the reviews and shame on you.  Does the production matter?  does the age of mother goose or the actors matter?  No.  The only thing that matters is that the babies/kids learn from it.  And my 10 month old grandaughter LOVES THIS!!  She is fully walking (and running) already and dances and laughs and makes that annoying, adorable ""HONK HONK"" sound that Bertram so often makes.  My girls (now 16, 20 and 21) watched the VHS's when they were little and still remember them.  I love them.  We don't put it on and sit her down we participate and dance and sing and laugh!!!  Enjoy the substance!!!!  And make your kids opinion and learning experience much more important than your annoyance!!! P.S. - I love the Baby Einsteins, but not more than these!!!!!",1187654400,11,773,4.569343065693431
1350861,5,B00004TJMR,"Someone gave us an old vhs copy of vol. 1 because her kids loved it.  Well, so does my son.  It's nice to have all the nursery rhymes together and although adults will be shocked at the fascination, this collection is a treasure through the eyes of a child.  I ordered the dvd volumes 1 and 2 because it has the entire collection of vhs 1-4, so the price isn't that far off.  You'll be shocked that the kids love it because the puppet/live people interaction is different.  Nonetheless, it is sure to be a favorite!",1174608000,4,515,4.322916666666667
1350862,3,B00004TJMR,"OK, if my 20-month-old son was reviewing this, he would give it 5 stars for sure.  I would give it 1 star at best, so I've compromised and given it 3 stars.  This is the most annoying kids video (along with volume 1) that I have ever watched - I have suffered through many annoying videos with two kids, but this has got to be the worst.  That $&#% goose must go ""HONK, HONK"" about a hundred times!  If you were just listening to the songs by themselves they would be OK, but watching the overacting and overcostumed cast is pure torture for my husband and I and any of our friends who have been present while this is playing (they all stop and say ""what IS this?""). There are a few puppets thrown in for fun, though they don't really seem to fit in.  But my son is transfixed whenever it is turned on and requests it even over Elmo sometimes.  They must be doing something right - the colors are nice and bright, kids must think the actors seem friendly, and the singing is not bad.  Many Mother Goose rhymes don't make a lot of sense but I don't think that matters much to the toddler set, and it is good for them to be exposed to some classic stories (even though what is peas porridge and who would want to eat it in the pot 9 days old, and why would Jack bandage his ""broken crown"" with vinegar and brown paper - huh?).  Anyway, your toddler may indeed love this, but you've been warned!",1154908800,3,1392,4.187265917602996

1350864,5,B00004TJMR,I am 23 and was watching the vhs of this when it first came out in 1989. I was 8. Well my son is 3 and I am now ordering it for him. I did not even know they still had it out and was amazed to see it is now on dvd. It is a timeless classic and I can not wait for my son to watch it.  sincerely Brenna,1103587200,,300,3.2253521126760565
1350865,4,B00004TJMR,I used to own this volume and part 2 as a child and watched both of them repeatedly. I would love to own them again and relive memories from the past. This is a great thing for children of today to have. Kids growing up these days probably have no idea who Mother Goose is. What a shame! And why people are reviewing this video like it's a big screen motion picture is ridiculous. This is very old and for the kids. It's Mother Goose nursery rhymes.

1350866,4,B00004TJMR,"Made back in 1987 as ""The Mother Goose Video Treasury"", this is the endearing production made. It features Cheryl Rhoalds as a young human Mother Goose and Will Ryan as the funny, but, often wisecracking Bertram. In the town of Gooseberry Glen, Mother Goose and her friendly ""watch-goose"" help many of the town, including the goofy Humpty Dumpty, Who falls after Mother Goose tells him to down from the wall.

While Bertram the Goose can get on your nerves a little, after 500 showings, hey, what doesn't? In any case, I would rather listen to these tapes any day vs. Barney or the Teletubbies. We have many fond memories of the songs and skits, and still sing many of them today. These are a must-have for your little ones, they love the bright costumes and the music.
