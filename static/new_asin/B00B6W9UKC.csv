5560205,3,B00B6W9UKC,"Not sure why they are a lot of bad reviews for this movie. I just finished watching it and thought it was pretty good. Its not one of the best foreign films ive ever seen, but it was still entertaining and overall i enjoyed. THIS IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE. Maybe some people gave the film bad reviews because they thought it was, but i would consider it more of a drama than a kung fu flick. Overall id give the film a 3/5, definitely worth checking out for those who love foreign films, not just kung fu films.",1376611200,3,513,4.14
5560206,4,B00B6W9UKC,"I know you're not supposed to judge a book (or a movie) by its cover, but the picture on the cover of THE GUILLOTINES was enough to immediately hook me.  Then, I saw the trailer, and that solidified my desire to see the film.  Interestingly enough, however, the movie is not quite as action-packed as the trailer makes it out to be.  This is not a bad thing, as the film is a moving, character-driven drama...but I have to confess that with the given premise, I was really hoping for more fighting.

I've read several negative reviews of this film, however I do not agree with a single one of them.  I think many folks went into it thinking it was a straight up action flick, and honestly, I was one of them; but pretty early on, you can tell that's not what you're getting.  Instead of insane martial arts, this film is chocked full of emotion and artistry, and it paints a vivid portrait of loyalty and duty that can sometimes clash with brotherhood.

THE GUILLOTINES is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The CG effects are lower-budget, but they're of no consequence overall; most of them are used for the weapons, which are also called Guillotines.  Each sword contains a razor-edged ring that can be hurled at enemies to decapitate, amputate, or simply maim them.  As such, you would think there would be a lot of gore here, too...but that's simply not the case, either.  The lack of carnage was one of the low points of the film for me.

But that shouldn't dissuade you from checking this film out.  It is a taut dramatic piece that focuses on the characters and their individual plights.  Some are dealing with loyalty to the Emperor even though he is making the wrong decisions...some are dealing with their destinies as a `prophet' to the oppressed, even though they don't feel worthy...and yet others are dealing with their loyalties to brotherhood, even though they might not feel the kinship they once did.  Regardless of where their personal demons dwell, each character is out to slay them.

Don't go into THE GUILLOTINES expecting a martial-arts or action extravaganza.  If you do, you'll be disappointed.  Instead, watch this one for what it is:  a riveting period piece that is driven by the cast.  Do this, and you should enjoy yourselves.  The film is available now.",1376611200,,2288,4.655860349127182
5560207,4,B00B6W9UKC,"I'm always skeptical about kung fu movies with CGI graphics because i believe that it ruins most kung fu movies, but i don't feel like it's over done in this movie. Most of the CGI graphics are during the scenes when they show how the guillotine weapons work. The acting is not bad and the original language is beautiful to hear. I bet most of the people who reviewed this movie watched it with English over dubs which completely ruins these foreign movies. I always watch kung fu movies in their original language in order to get the true feel of the emotion involved.

With that being said, i loved the story and plot of this movie. I found it to be inspirational and refreshing, especially towards the end when it all unfolds. I would recommend this movie to people who love kung fu movies and enjoy inspiring story plots.",1375920000,4,825,4.5

With modern technology, the flying guillotine could be a sight to behold. Don't expect this in this movie.

5560228,1,B00B6W9UKC,"Based on the previews, I expected the typical bad guy turns good guy who leads the way to save village people who changed him for the better.  It started off with the expected action that appeared promising. But you couldn't' tell who the bad guys were because, well, they were all bad. It goes downhill from there. I have never seen so much blubbering from virtually everyone. Rarely does a scene go by when someone isn't slobbering over something or someone. And the thing is, the film does so little character development, that no one cares when someone kicks the bucket. Throw in the obligatory ""perfect village with smiling old people and laughing kids"" scenes coupled with a ridiculous ""Jesus Christ"" martyr story thread and you realize that this movie has no bottom, it just gets worse.  So then you think, maybe the film will redeem itself with a bloody redemption fight between the converted bad guy and his former evil bosses.  We don't even get that. Instead the bad guy turned good guy kills the religious leader head (which depressingly, elicits so little sympathy because that character was equally annoying) capped off with, you guessed it, more blubbering. The writers of this film should have been sent to the guillotines.",1393804800,3,1239,4.862559241706161

5560232,1,B00B6W9UKC,"Guillotines' special effects looked like digital paintings. I mean they looked fake especially when the assassins were making them rotating faster and faster before throwing them at the victims.

The action scenes offer nothing interesting compared to other movies starring Jet Li, or Donnie Yen.

The acting is not convincing.

The plot is different than other movies of the same genre but the characters were not given enough time to develop properly.

In short, it's not worth it.",1385769600,,483,5.153846153846154
5560233,3,B00B6W9UKC,"I was looking for something that would be BlackBelt Theater, this movie started in that direction, and then DEVOLVED into a drama.
the trailer and begging of the movie were very mis-leading.  I watched it all the way through, and it turned out to be a very good drama.",1384819200,4,268,4.469387755102041

5560237,2,B00B6W9UKC,"I must say, the first 15mins was rather engaging with all the Asian manga fest on display. I was ready so ready for a visual feast and a story to match however after all the anticipation and managing to finish the movie, I've got to say the title and the description of the movie itself was all there in the first 15mins. The rest, all I did was put up with the elite assassins crying like babies and an Asian Jesus like character who could've easily stopped preaching and kicked some serious butt but didn't.
Overall the bad script led the actors to poor portrayal of their character... And eventually the whole movie ended up losing the plot.. Once you start this movie, you'll most likely sit through the duration, however be warned you'll be left with a feeling of what could've been...",1381276800,,790,4.531468531468532
5560238,3,B00B6W9UKC,"I have been a fan of quality martial arts movies for more than thirty five years.  I loved movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Enter the Dragon, The Iron Monkey, Circle of Iron, House of Daggers, Hero and numerous other great martial art theme movies.

 I purchased this one thinking it would be in the same class of the above mentioned classics; however, The Guillotines does not even come close to being that good.  This movie is about a secret group of assassins called ""The Guillotines"" who the Emperor created to destroy his enemies.  Once a new regime came into power the assassin group were basically thrown to the wolves and hunted down eventually killed.

Some of the martial art scenes were okay in this film, but it was sometimes difficult to keep track of all the characters and who was supposed to be the good guys and bad guys.  of course, this is fairly common in some of these Asian made martial art films.  This DVD has English sub-titles which I like because I can better follow the story and theme of the movie.

In conclusion, this is an okay and fair martial arts movie and if you are into Asian martial art stories you may enjoy viewing this film.

5560239,2,B00B6W9UKC,"Some movies try to recreate history from the past. Some just want to incorporate some fantasy of some elite ninja group that defies all reality and ends up winning in the end, though history does not support that realistic true ending, that such a story applies here.

This is another one of those films where the trailer is far more exciting than the actual film. Though the history may be true to some extent, the story itself on film was a waste of my buying very expensive, unhealthy, theatre popcorn.

I usually trust the great movies that have been coming out from Well Go USA, but I guess I've been jumping too quickly on some of their releases. I've been getting some real duds lately.",1378598400,,693,4.536

8563471,1,B00B6W9UKC,"This is a Martial Arts movie WITHOUT any martial ""arts"".
When I purchase a bluray, I always ascertain on the rewatchability of the movie. On a scale of
10, this movie scores 1 on rewatchability.
99% of the film focuses on depressing dialogue, and it meanders on and on........
Martial arts fans should steer clear of this drab boring movie.
Whatever fighting scenes there are in this film, one can see in daily life between any 2
drunken ruffians on the streets; just throwing  plain wild punches and kicks at each other.
The fight scenes just comprises of people crudely punching the next person, or using swords
to slash the next person, or using rifles to shoot a person. There is NO ""arts"" or skill at all
displayed in the fighting scenes; just crude, simple punches or kicks shown by the actors.
I am inclined to think, for this film, there is no martial arts instructor, or if there is one, he is
a master charlatan.
Do rent or better still, view this movie free before deciding to buy; I just don't understand
some reviewers claiming this is a ""good martial arts film with lots of action""; maybe these
are shills.
PLEASE, PLEASE try to view this movie for free first, before ever regretting after
purchasing it.
There should be no encouragement or incentive for such films to be made in the name
of Martial Arts to deceive the paying consumer.
Otherwise the film makers will be laughing all the way to the bank with your hard
earned movie for this shameful, fiasco of a rubbish movie.",1448928000,,1491,4.584269662921348
