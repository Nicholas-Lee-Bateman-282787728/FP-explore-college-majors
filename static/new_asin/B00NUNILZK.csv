6680363,5,B00NUNILZK,"I got this at a good price. It was in my saved shopping basket for quite some time. Yeah, already bought the first three seasons, but, with all the
special edition complete seasons still abundant, knowing SEASON FOUR, of six, is not due before February, I jumped into the double-dip pool.
I believe that the price I got this for---less than the $139 everyone keeps talking about---is a as good as I'll get it... until after seasons 4-6 are,
individually, released. Since I'll be 67 next year, this is just NOT a purchase that I can put off indefinately. Not only did I get a bargain with this, I
saved a BUNDLE on the 18-Blu-ray ""THAT '70s SHOW""... it, literally went up $50 the day after I bought it. I double-dipped there, too... I had the
24 DVDs, but couldn't resist the bargain. Anyone in Germany want my left-overs?
The economy AIN'T gettin' any better, and ""the wolf"" is at my door. I happen to love ""THAT '70s'"", and... '60s show TOO! Is it any wonder?! It
wouldn't hurt me to eat LESS, and watch more TV... better than EXERCISE!

___________________________________________________________________________________
It has been brought to my attention that this version, and, the 22-disc version have Closed  Captions, but,
alas[!] have NO Spanish language, nor, subtitles. I never said there was, and reviewers HAVE mentioned
it. The product description on this [26 DVD] version is incorrect, in THAT regard.

Though the series have cc (closed captions)  then you have to forget any HDMI upscaling or even a component connection.  My dream is that someday The Wonder Years become available in Bluray with Spanish audio and subtitles, meanwhile I will enjoy it on these DVDs which are not different to my recordings of the series except for the extras",1444780800,24,510,4.473118279569892

6680374,3,B00NUNILZK,"The show is a 10/5 stars, no doubt!  But this packaging is disappointing.  Each time you remove a DVD from the beautiful but troubling cardboard folders it leaves micro=scratches on the DVDs.  Look at them under a lamp so you can see the surface clearly, they are there right where the disc slid across the folder as you pulled it out.  What you have to do is remove the DVDs as carefully as possible and never put them back in the folders again.  Mine are in paper folders for now.

The episodes themselves could look and sound better.  This show is worthy of restoration.  But with that said, they did a marvelous job of getting this ""impossible to release"" show out.  I know I'm not the only one who has overwhelming nostalgia for The Wonder Years.  And it couldn't be better seeing this show again with most of the original music after all these years of waiting.  Every time a song appears in an episode it just leaves me elated.",1500681600,,934,4.435294117647059
6680375,4,B00NUNILZK,"The least one can do before publicly criticizing something is to take the time to research the issue at hand. First of all, the picture quality doesn't represent the current quality standards do to the fact that it was made in an age with different (lesser) standards. If my information is correct, the series was shot on 16mm film but mastered in VHS. This means that the final edits and the actual master of the show is in the VHS format. You can't improve on the original just because you put it on a newer (better quality) format. Those demanding Blu-ray versions of the series would also do well to keep this in mind. The only improvements that a Blu-ray release might create is a slightly less compressed image (and this would hardly be worth the price of an upgrade). If a VHS image isn't improved just by putting it on a DVD disc, it is ridiculous to expect any improvement from a Blu-ray release. Time Life has done a great job reproducing the original broadcast quality of these episodes and have gone to all kinds of trouble to make sure fans see these episodes with their original music in tact. The ONLY thing to complain about regarding their packaging concerns the DVD folder-style design that doesn't really offer much protection and might very well scratch the disc. Some slight modifications should have been made so that the discs could be held in a proper tray. I really dislike this new ""folder"" trend so common with recent boxed sets.",1500508800,,1456,4.625482625482626

6680377,5,B00NUNILZK,"Arguably the best written half-hour television show in history, and certainly one of the best of the 80s/90s.  Many in the world have been waiting for music clearances to be secured, and thanks to Time-Warner, purveyors of the Time-Life Music History series, the whole Emmy Award-winning Wonder Years canon is now available. All six seasons, with bonus interviews and featurettes at the end of every season, and four additional discs of interviews and reminiscences by the cast, writers, directors, producers, creators, and key grip.  It's almost too much.

On a trivial note, a few of the opening credit scenes feature a different country singer performing Joe Cocker's arrangement of the Beatles' ""With A Little Help From My Friends"".  It's interesting, but not a major drawback.",1496966400,3,781,5.224

6680437,3,B00NUNILZK,"I was not only glad to see the Wonder Years finally released on DVD, but I was glad to see that it is now available in a ""shelf-friendly"" cardboard slipcase, AND at a more reasonable price than previous incarnations, AND that most of the original music is intact!

I had to knock off two stars for the way that the actual DVDs are packaged though. I have no gripes with the cardboard slipcase- that is what I wanted- as opposed to the metal locker or plastic slipcase versions- but the problem is, that the actual DVDs are housed in mere cardboard sleeves, which are bound into 2 ""notebook-style"" volumes (And I believe that this is the case even with the metal locker and plastic slipcase versions.

I mean seriously, these sets are noit exactly bargain-priced- and I would have hoped that the DVDs would have at least been housed in normal plastic, hubbed holders- but instead, they are wedged TIGHTLY into double-sided cardboard pages. They are quite cumbersome to remove and get back in- and because of the tight fit, and heavy amou8nt of friction created by the whole DVD being in contact with the cardboard, and needing to be slid in and out, it will not be long until the discs are scratched and worn just from taking them in and out of the cheesy packaging. I would surmise that the manufacturer doe this on purpose to ensure that there will be few sets available for sale on the used market- because they will all be scratched and scuffed in short order.

My one other grip-e is that there is a lot repetition in the extras. Don't get me wrong- there are some great extras- the interviews and discussions with cast and crew are thoroughly enjoyable- but many segments of the longer interviews are recycled and used multiple times in various features.

But hey, it's great to finally see this series on DVD! I certainly don't want to discourage anyone from buying it- I just want them to be aware of the issues I mentioned- and perhaps in the future, at least the packaging can be improved.

As for the show itself: I had enjoyed this show watching some episodes many years ago when I used to watch TV- so naturally I was very happy to see it finally released on DVD. Being a child of the 60's/70's myself, I just loved the nostalgia; the references to real-world events of the period; and of course, the MUSIC!

But watching this series in order on DVD, made me soon come to the realization that this is essentially a love story about 2 twelve year-olds! Kevin and Winnie's relationship is just too over-emphasized. Now, every time i hear Smokey Robinson singing ""Oooo Baby, Baby"" I picture romantic scenes between these two 12 year-olds, and it totally creeps me out! It just isn't right! I like the nostalgia, but i really don't care to follow the relationship details of adolescents/teens! I mean, sheesh! It seems everything spewing from the mainstream media is obsessed with sex and romance. Pretty sad when they even have to infuse a show about adolescents with that obsession. I mean, what's next? Will Spongebob Squarepants be ""getting it on"" with a clam?

IMO, this is a show that works the first time around, when it's new to you and you are taking it all in, and enjoying the nostalgia- but it does not withstand the scrutiny of repeated viewings, wherein the nostalgic aspects become familiar and fade, and all that is left is a love story involving 12 year-olds. Eeeeesh!

Ultimately, I sold my Wonder Years DVD set after going through it once. No regrets. Once was enough. And I can no longer listen to ""Oooo Baby, Baby"" :( ......",1448496000,18,3553,4.610759493670886

8680309,4,B00NUNILZK,I was 100% sure I was going to buy this since the day I heard about it finally coming out. Shop around & compare the different options that are on the market. The price bounces around quiet a bit & what you all get varies from basic disks to many extra bells & whistles. Overall its very well done & priceless in my mind. I do think however for the price you pay the book disk holders should be a better quality than cardboard. As far as the bonus features go some of it is interesting & worthwhile however much of it just drags on & on & repeats itself over & over. Bottom line if you love the show as much as I do this is a must have.,1522108800,2,636,3.9
