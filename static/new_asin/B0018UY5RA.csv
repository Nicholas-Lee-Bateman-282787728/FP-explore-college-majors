8271209,4,B0018UY5RA,"Paramount studios specialised in classy continental romantic comedies and this is one of the very best. Exquisitely directed by Frank Borzage, that master of romance, and produced by Ernst Lubitsch, that master of the bedroom farce, ""Desire"", released in 1936, stars Marlene Dietrich in one of her wittiest performances as a jewel thief who reforms under the influence of love for American engineer Gary Cooper. Cooper was also never more droll and relaxed and together, they make maybe the best looking couple in American films of the thirties. The lighting and editing are outstanding so the film presents as a delicate piece of porcelain, every nuance carefully constructed and magically presented. Dietrich looks sensational as dressed by Travis Banton, her favourite designer. She also  sings a song at the piano which is worth the price of the DVD alone. The reaction shots of Cooper, squinting with delight, mirror our own.

The print is very good in spite of some intermittant pops and a few verticle lines in places. There are no extras other than the obligatory scene selection. The DVD is available in the UK very cheaply but you will need a multi region player to watch it outside the Commonwealth/Europe.",1292371200,,1217,5.0497512437810945
