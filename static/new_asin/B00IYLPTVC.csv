6305226,5,B00IYLPTVC,"From the same production team that developed the outstanding Israeli TV show Srugim, this series manages to top its older sibling in every respect.  This is to take nothing away from the earlier show, only to note that the writing, acting and production values of Shtisel are always just as strong and often stronger, and, interestingly but perhaps not surprisingly, the fact that the show deals with the Charedi (Ultra-Orthodox) sector lends the series a gravitas that was missing from Srugim.

Not that it's all serious; the show is, by turns, deadly earnest, wryly funny, provocative and even tender in its portrayal of Charedi Jews.  Negative reviews that attack the show simply because it represents Charedi life sympathetically are guilty of bringing their own unfortunate agenda to the table.

As for the show itself, it gets its name from several interwoven story-lines, each following a member of the Shtisel family.  The bulk of the series follows the recently widowed family patriarch, Shulem Shtisel, and his unmarried (and hard to marry) youngest son Akiva who is in love with a twice-widowed older Charedi woman, Elisheva (played by the magnificent Ayelet Zurer).  Akiva's older brother and sister each get a piece of the story arc, too, with the most compelling narrative going to his sister, Giti, who is struggling to keep her family afloat while she faces some challenges from her husband (played brilliantly by Zohar Strauss whom some will remember as Hodaya's on again off again love interest in Srugim).  As remarkable as all of the narratives and actors are, though, the real hidden treasure in this series lies in the character of Shulem's mother, a new resident in a local rest home who just bought a TV for the first time in her life and dispenses wisdom to her descendents in Yiddish about as often as she does Hebrew.

Everything about this show is stellar.  The stories are complex and weighty while still evoking smiles.  The characters are a compelling and nuanced representation of frum Jews.  Issues that bedevil the Charedi are tackled candidly but the goal is never to demonize the Ultra-Orthodox.  Get a hold of this show as soon as you're able, watch it all the way through and then pray for the speedy release of Season 2.",1398470400,12,2259,4.91578947368421
6305227,5,B00IYLPTVC,"this is an excellent show which i think just won a ton of israeli academy awards for television.  that other nasty review should be removed by amazon as the person obviously hates frum people.

the beauty of this show is that it portrays the lifestyle of the haredi community accurately but sensitively and shows how complex people are.  it is rich and dramatic and funny.  it literally made me catch my breath time and time again with how it was able to show the human struggle.  watch it.  it is so worth your time to do so.",1398384000,,526,4.371134020618556
6305228,1,B00IYLPTVC,"...this series has only hardened my long held and intense loathing of Hasidim.
For those wishing to maake hay of my dislike for un and nonproductive sects & cultic groups,
allow me to clearly state that I am as far from an anti-semite as it is possible to get, however I am
repelled and pupulsed by everythiing about them.
Sorry I wasted the money. The purchase was based on my affection for the talented Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer, a terrific
actress, brought low by the atmosphere and story. Poor lady.
How awful this thing was to view. The only thing missing was the sour stale smell of cigarets
and insuficiently washed bodies, and none to clean clothing.
One star for the good service of the seller and professional packaging.",1397347200,,733,4.689922480620155

6305233,5,B00IYLPTVC,wonderful drama that shows the warm and gentle side of the Jewish orthodox world; the holy religious life from which those feelings spring is not as emphasized but is there to be seen by anyone who wishes to see it,1419724800,,214,4.375
6305234,5,B00IYLPTVC,"OUTSTANDING, but anyone interested in Israeli TV series has already heard that!",1417478400,,79,5.666666666666667
6305235,4,B00IYLPTVC,"This drama focuses on the Shtisels, a Haredi (very conservative, ultra-Orthodox form of Judaism) family living in Jerusalem. Though they live a very different lifestyle from other cultures, they share many of the same problems and personal struggles which are a reality to every single one of us. And as this Jewish Daily Forward article points out, unlike other media depictions of the Haredi culture, this one doesnt focus on the religion as an oppressive prison that must be escaped, or as the only true answer to everything. The religious lifestyle is the backdrop to a very in-depth character study, focusing on the the day to day miracles and tragedies of the human condition and reminding us that we aren't all so different.

Akiva (Michael Aloni) is a rabbi who has recently started teaching at the Talmud Torah (local school) where his father Shulem (Dovale Glickman) works. Akiva is of marrying age and reluctantly searches for his future wife with the help of a Haredi matchmaker. But when he falls for the widowed mother (Ayelet Zurer) of one of his students, his father tries to convince him to find a younger bride without so much baggage.

Meanwhile, Shulem guiltily forms a friendship with a woman who works at the school, limiting their relationship to eating her cooking and making small talk as he still struggles to get over the death of his wife.

The oldest daughter Giti (Neta Riskin) is stuck with five kids including a newborn after her husband (Zohar Strauss) is sent to Argentina to work at a slaughter house. Giti doesnt want them to go, but it is to support the family. He is supposed to be back in six months, but when Giti doesnt hear from him and starts investigating, she is forced to consider that he might not be coming back. Giti had one of the most compelling story lines in the show, with the strongest cliffhanger plot points that made us want to keep watching.

Shtisel is not action packed, it doesnt conceal a big mystery and it doesnt end with crazy-epic cliffhangers, but we instantly cared about the characters and it never got boring. Though its a drama, it has a strong comedic side, making fun of the little things that make us all human.

Thanks to its incredibly relatable and entertaining characters, the show gives all cultures a peek into a way of life which, to many, could seem strange and alien from the outside. Regardless of your background or religious beliefs, you will be able to find at least one character to identify with and relate to in Shtisel. Fantastic writing and performances, with a very polished look and incredible locations.",1409788800,4,2599,4.766666666666667
6305236,4,B00IYLPTVC,I thouight the program had an incredible potential with many ideas just not developed well. i loved the glimps into the Hassidim s life . I loved the Yeddish talk . The show is pretty heavy . I highly recommend it .,1404777600,2,215,4.142857142857143
6305237,5,B00IYLPTVC,"The heading says it all. Great even if you aren't interested in the Hassidim or their community. The stories are powerful and human, instantly relate-able, and the characters engaging, even if some are a bit broadly drawn (like the matchmaker). Highly entertaining.",1404000000,5,265,5.333333333333333

8646403,5,B00IYLPTVC,I just bought two seasons from an Israeli site and while you a) need a region free player and also the subtitles are hard to arrange at first once things happen this series is even better than Srugim which I watched on Amazon Prime and adored I am hooked on Shtisel  and its ultra Orthodox world..  Hey I'm an Irish Catholic and this world still reaches me more than anything I'm watching on T.V. other than This is Us.  There love stories in Shtisel are captivating and if you have a region free player and a heart you will love this show.,1487462400,,540,4.2745098039215685
8646404,5,B00IYLPTVC,Almost done with the first season. This series is addictive and authentic. Wish  there were English subtitles. Get most of the Hebrew but it gets tough when Yiddish is spoken. The narrative smashes stereotypes and should increase tolerance for Chasidism.,1473984000,,254,5.35
8646405,1,B00IYLPTVC,"We finally opened the 4-disc package.  We are in NYC.  At first, the DVR said, ""Reading"" and then, ""Incorrect disc"".

The discs must be for Israeli TVs.  We cannot watch it at all.  We are MOST disappointed!  There was no option for a US or Israeli disc.",1469145600,,254,4.297872340425532
