1807787,5,B00007ELE1,"I've been a fan of the Everlys forever and have been hoping for a release of the Reunion Concert on DVD for years.  This DVD does not disappoint as far as quality and sound.  A bit short and it doesn't have all of the songs they sang at the Reunion Concert, but it will show music fans why these guys are in both the Rock & Roll and County Music Hall of Fame.
Harmony singing doesn't get any better than this.",1043193600,,409,4.037037037037037

It has some extra songs that were not included in the orginal VHS release, and perhaps when it aired on PBS.  They play all their hits with a excellent Nashville band backing them. They chit chat and tell stories...its a good time, it will put a smile on your face. If you are a Everly Brothers fan, this is for you. If your not ""into"" watching them play but love listening to the music, then this in itself is better than listening to it on CD. Dont forget to thank your stars that they released this after decades of new eras and trends in music that makes this look outmoded and forgotten.",1040688000,2,701,4.2706766917293235

I've seen the Everly Brothers perform 13 times over the past several years.  In fact, it was the original PBS broadcast of this historic concert that made me re-discover the incredible vocal harmony of Phil and Don.
Now that live performances by this trailblazing duo are rare indeed, it's comforting to know that this concert is about to be released in digital format.
Fans of rock and roll music from the fifties to the present day will thoroughly enjoy this presentation.  I can't wait for its release.  Wow, a belated Christmas present!",1037577600,14,632,4.814814814814815

1807791,5,B00007ELE1,"Filmed in Albert Hall in London in the mid 80s, this reunion tour was a magical night while the delicate harmony of the brothers was perfect.  The song versions are very close to originals. Conversations were low-key and, they still both looked handsome.

Their daddy, musician Ike Everly, performed many years ago.  But if ever their voices harmonize well, it is with those old folk tales.

No other duo has ever evoked such vocal purity as the Everlys. They sound as one, even though there lies that distinction in their voices.  And no performance they will ever do will compare to this reunion at Albert Hall.  The two looked great! ......Rizzo",1013817600,9,984,5.846153846153846

Then, sadly, learning of Phil Everly's death early this year, I went to ""youtube"" just to see them perform.
I then saw them performing the Reunion Concert cassettes!! This very well done DVD flooded me with wonderful memories of the beloved Everly Brothers from years gone by.  Their vocals are amazing as is the band that backs them up. I would definitely recommend this DVD.  RIP Phil, you are missed, but you live on through your music.",1400112000,,545,4.726315789473684

OK if you're picky you could say that Phil's harmony isn't as good as the recordings and some of those high notes that you expect are missing, but what the hell, it still sounds great! At age 40 or so your voice naturally lowers anyway so I think we can forgive that can't we?? Yh as some have eluded there are some little tensions but I think they are both very happy to be there overall and you can tell that too by the way they look into each others eyes that the love is still there too!! The band is very good I think, good musicians of course and all the riffs are there. Yes all in all great!! Now that Phil is gone I wonder what Don will do? In his 70's now and no Phil to sing with he may well just sit back and do nothing? You can't replace Phil of course!! :-)",1392336000,,860,3.9482758620689653

I've had a crush on him for over 50 years and he still looks great! I think It is HIGH TIME a movie was made about them!!! They have led fascinating lives!! More interesting than Johnny Cash or Buddy Holly or any other singing star!! They didn't have a serious drug problems, or drank too much, they were decent, honest, fantastically TALENTED singer/songwriters.

1807815,5,B00007ELE1,"Reading all the other reviews, I have to ask myself ""what is up with these people?""

The Everly Brothers are an American Treasure. Be proud of them.

I've been a fan of theirs since about 1957 or so and have seen them in concert in UK many, many times. As for the reviewer who said the Brit fans at the Albert Hall ""sat on their hands"", well, over here, we go to hear the music, not the sound of our own voices.

This is a superb DVD. Buy it and enjoy.

PS The backing guitarist is the fantastic Albert Lee, one of UK's finest - He also was a member of the Crickets for a time",1215043200,4,576,3.939655172413793
1807816,5,B00007ELE1,"This was just another great nostalgia trip!  Considering the time that lapsed between their musical origins and successes, and the time the concert was performed, the Everly Brothers were almost as dynamic as when they began.  The vocal quality was very surprising, and they stayed within their contemporary ranges to maintain their legendary harmony.  This DVD was well worh waiting for, and some numbers raised goose-bumps.",1210204800,4,425,5.409090909090909
1807817,4,B00007ELE1,"This is a great addition to any rock and roll lovers collection.  The Everly Brothers are the real deal, and this concert from Royal Albert Hall in 1982 shows that they can rock, sing country, and make you cry with their ballads.  Of all the greatest early rockers, I think these guys influenced more acts (especially UK ones) than anyone except Chuck Berry.  Also, this has 5.1 surround, so that should make your viewing even more enjoyable.",1210204800,,442,4.714285714285714
1807818,5,B00007ELE1,I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes these two and any 50's/60's music fans. A very emotional reunion.,1207785600,,115,4.8
1807819,4,B00007ELE1,"""The Everly Brothers Reunion Concert: Live From The Royal Albert Hall London"" (1983) documents their being brought back together after a long, nasty quarrel.  The brothers, whose sweet, close harmonies were seminal in early American rock and roll, rockabilly division, are now in their mid-40's, playing together for the first time in ten years: they take the stage with their acoustic guitars, and backing by a select group.  Early in the show, we see Don, the elder brother, answering the questions he must most often have been asked about it, such as why the Albert Hall; he answers that their last show there, ten years ago, was a great triumph, witnessed by their mother and father.  And that, though their parents are gone, they know there's still an appreciative audience there for them, -- and there was -- generations of loyal fans, and musicians they've inspired: Beach Boys, Beatles, and so forth.

First and foremost, let it be said, as to the music: the brothers still can rock, and swing, too.  Nor has their famed close harmony suffered from the long absence, as the brothers lean their heads in together the better to work, obviously concentrating hard on the tune at hand.  They open on the lovely ballad ""Crying in the Rain;"" it will be followed-up that evening by several other sweet ballads, including the English folk song ""Barbara Allen,"" and a medley of ""Devoted,"" ""Ebony Eyes,"" and ""Love Hurts."" There's a gorgeous ""All I Have to Do Is Dream,"" delivered heads close together, harmony closer; they close with a quiet, supremely beautiful ""Let It Be Me.""  But the brothers rock, as well. ""Cathy's Clown"" sure swings; so do ""Love Is Strange,"" ""When Will I Be Loved,"" and ""Sad to Watch Good Love Go Bad.""  The brothers rock out on ""Bird Dog,"" ""Be-Bop-a-Lula,"" and ""Until I Kissed You,"" as well as they ever did.  They swing on the rockabilly ""Step It Up and Go,"" and, as they pulled out the stops on ""Lucille,"" they had the crowd standing and stomping.

The DVD is a valuable document if you care for early rock, or rockabilly; you might want to add it to your collection.",1190937600,4,2092,4.738292011019284

1807821,5,B00007ELE1,"My older sisters were of the generation for the Everly Brothers but I think I had them in my psyche.  I am of the Beatles generation but I can hear the Everly Brothers in the Beatles. Regardless of the generation, the E.Brother's music are part country and part rock.  Listening to them on this DVD brings tears to my eyes.  Their voices are so pure and they soar to beautiful heights.

This is one great DVD and I can recommend it to anybody who wants to hear the genesis of rock & roll even before Chuck Berry.  Beautiful music, beautiful voices.  Worth the price.",1166227200,4,566,4.394230769230769
1807822,2,B00007ELE1,"I bought the DVD sight unseen for a friend adding a copy for myself.  It was good seeing the Everly Brothers performing together again.  They brought their tuxes.  They brought their Guitars.  They forgot to bring their souls.  Don and Phil Everly clunked their way mechanically through all their great hits.  The performance was better than simply mediocre.  But the SOUL, that thing that animates a performance and brings life to it and makes it true art, was missing.  I am old enough to have seen the Everly Brothers perform live and on television giving far more animated and engaged performances than their ""Reunion Concert"" in Royal Albert Hall.  The magic is gone; probably forever.  It is a tragic loss to music, to the Everly Brothers fans and to those of us who came up during this exciting period of musical change.

Thank you!",1142467200,2,839,4.756944444444445

1807825,5,B00007ELE1,"I saw this concert when it was aired on TV. From what I can remember, the TV version cut out two great songs that are included in this dvd. The whole concert is great and you can tell that they are giving there best, because of all the sweat on there face. If you connect this concert up to your sound system, it is great. The only thing that I noticed that was different, was that when the band returns from there break. The bass and treble quality greatly increased, and sounds even better. This is one of those concerts that you won't be able to watch just once, but over and over. You can tell that they have the audience completly under control.",1120003200,2,650,4.25
1807826,2,B00007ELE1,"The Everly Brothers have been on my best-loved list since the late 50s and I thoroughly enjoyed the VHS version of their heralded Reunion Concert. I couldn't wait for the new DVD technology to catch up with this great show. Upon watching this DVD version for the first time I can only express my disappointment in the sound and picture quality. The Everly Brothers were in A-1 form, their British fans pretty much sat on their hands, and the sound and picture quality were awful. Don't waste your money on the DVD -- buy the VHS version and ENJOY!!!",1109808000,11,549,4.555555555555555
1807827,4,B00007ELE1,"I am writing this review as the Ashlee Simpson/SNL lip synching controversy stirs.  Oh horrors, our current pop stars are fakes!  In that environment, I finally got around to buying and rewatching this Everly Brothers concert from 1983.  By the end, all I could say was WOW!  What voices!  What talent!  It is such a shame that popular culture took such a wrong turn somewhere.

But did anyone go in and do CPR on that crowd, or are those stiffs still sitting in Albert Hall?  What was up with that audience?  I'm an old fogey now, but I KNOW I would have been up and shaking my tailfeathers during ""Bird Dog"", ""Claudette"", ""Lucille"", etc..  This band and the Everly's really rocked that night!  Shame the audience was velcroed to their seats.

Actually, I bought this after going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Seems that during the 50 minute film on the Hall's inductees, they couldn't afford a single second to allow you to hear this duo's voices.  I was left empty and just wanted to hear their harmonies again.  I am absolutely blown away.  I believe Paul Simon said their influence far exceeded their fame.  He is so right.

The Everly's get a 5 for this DVD.  The makers get a 3 for leaving songs out and giving no extras.  I average that to a 4.",1098835200,6,1258,4.4104803493449785
1807828,4,B00007ELE1,"I can remember seeing them at the Bitter End on Bleeker Street in Greenwich Village so close I could touch them, and at The Westbury Music fair in the round.........
Even though they've changed the phrasing on a couple of their songs, and it's not quite the way they did it on the record, the Everly Brothers are living Rock and Roll legends that cannot be replaced by anyone, and seeing them in person, or even here on DVD, is a wonderful experience.....
Two points: first, to sing the same songs for 40 years, night after night, and often not being allowed to grow past those sacred hits can take a lot out of any musician, and singing into that same mike every night, with the same guy and the same songs can really take a toll on any relationship......of course the people in the audience only care about hearing their favorite songs the way they remember them, and are unaware, (as they should be) that they sang the same set the same way last night and every night for the past 40 years.....it gets to you
Second, in any relationship, often one dominates and the other doesn't, and when that happens over and over and you don't just work together but you're family as well, well Don still sees Phil as his baby brother, and now that both men are in their 50's.....it's easy to see why the split up happened.....(The Beatles were destined for the same thing as soon as Brian Epstein was lost...no buffer)
All that in mind, I bought this the second I saw it......the sound is OK, but not as good as you would have liked, because the band and the background music was not what they deserved......and the boys are older, as are we all, and time has a way of......
And you could see that at this point, there was still some tension between these two wonderful musicians......
For the record, the last time I saw them, years after this show, the tension was gone, they were having fun again, and you could tell that both they, and the world around them, had accepted that these weren't just the Everly Brothers, but that these were the ONLY two EVERLY BROTHERS in the universe, and they finally had, and realized they had, all the respect they deserved.",1054684800,53,2153,4.480916030534351
1807829,5,B00007ELE1,"Most of us seem to have forgotten that back in 1983 actually 2 concerts were played: both on 22nd and 23rd September The Everly Brothers played at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The several CD releases are recordings of one these concerts, but this DVD release is the other show! So, no complaints about this release as being ""incomplete"" or whatever......
Just compare the songs to the ones on the CD's, and you'll find out that these are different recordings. Both the DVD and the CD's state September 23rd as date of recording, but one of them must be wrong.
Differences can be heard clearly on Don's solo singing parts: Cathy's Clown and Love Is Strange are obvious examples. Even Bye Bye Love is treated differently by Don in his second solo part.
So get hold of this film! By doing so, you get a hold on the first or second reunion concert! (I honestly can't tell which concert is 23rd September or not...)
Futhermore, just watch Don and Phil looking at each other during Let It Be Me.....how close to perfect harmony can you get?? Well, this actually IS perfect harmony! Enjoy!",1048032000,31,1086,4.603092783505154

The next day I took another look and realized I didn't have surround sound turned on the first time through. What a difference a day makes! Considering this was recorded 20 years ago, the sound is absolutely superb! And don't get me wrong, the picture isn't bad....it just isn't up to 2003 standards.
I will treasure this DVD along with my other DVD concert gems. But the best part is that it gives me hope that the technology will be used to bring new life to other master performances of the 60's, 70's and 80's.

It wasn't until 1999 (fifteen years after the original show!) that we finally saw a double CD release of ""The Complete Reunion Concert"" featuring the material of the show in its entirety (25 tracks in all).
Looking at this DVD (and its 20 tracks) I am just wondering if this release simply follows that same ""practice"" so firmly established by the music industry today?
It's just mind-boggling that with a format like DVD (which virtually provides no limitations in its art form) they were not able to get it right from the start!
They have all the material, state-of-the art sound and still they decide to cut out half an hour out of the original show?",1043884800,19,784,4.7299270072992705

7975480,5,B00007ELE1,"Don was born in 1937 in 'Browne, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky.
Phil was born in 1939 in 'Chicago' Illinois.
They received 'The Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame' award in 1986 - 'Country Music Hall of Fame' in 2001.
During their early years they performed on K.M.A and KFNF radio in 'Shenandoah' with their parents - The Everly Family Show'
In 1956 as a duo they signed up for RCA records but had no success, in 1957 they were persuaded to sign for the 'Cadence-Label'
this signalled the beginning of a sparkling Chart Career for the Brothers, three years later they switched to the Warner-Label, their
first release penned by Don and Phil proved to be their most successful Chart-Hit ever - 'Cathy's Clown'
They continued to pepper the charts both sides of the Atlantic especially during the early 60's, but faded some during the group
revolution of that time.
In 1973 sadly after a fall out they split and pursued solo careers, 'Don' had some moderate success in the U.S Country Charts, 'Phil'
had very little however, but as fans will know did have a Top-Ten hit in the early 80's with 'She Means Nothing To Me' sung with 'Cliff
Richard'
When they performed their reunion concert at the 'Royal Albert Hall' in 1983 it sure pleased many of their 1000's of fans that had followed
them during the early years like myself.
As mentioned before i was fortunate enough to have seen them on stage, firstly in 1962 though 'Don' had returned to the 'States' with
health issues, 'Phil' continued the tour, however on their 1965 tour i was able to see both on-stage.
Sadly i was unable to attend a concert at the local venue during 'Don and Phil's' farewell tour in November 2005, i'd have loved to have
seen them perform one more time.
This release i've owned since it's DVD release, the reunion in front of a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall 'September 23rd 1983'
Pure magic, great memories, and good quality picture and sound.
They continued performing together until 2005, the Brothers inspired many that followed them in the 60's including 'The Beatles' 'The Stones'
and 'Simon and Garfunkel'

7975482,5,B00007ELE1,"I loved getting hold of the reunion concert and I will purchase another in case I wear it out, but I would really love to find a DVD with the complete concert on it. I don't know why they removed The Price of Love from the beginning and Good Golly Miss Molly at the end. There is a CD out there called The Everly Brothers 2 CD's ( the two boys are standing facing the front, Donald has a blue check coat over a white turtle neck and Phil has a denim jacket over a cream turtle neck. It is actually the reunion concert, having all the songs on it, good sound as well. I just wish there was a DVD out there somewhere it would be absolutely fantastic. The DVD shot in Australia in 1968 is black and white, not remastered but very funny, have watched it to death",1425340800,,758,4.06
