4521495,3,B0051F2AEI,"I like Scott and have many of his DVDs. He is relaxed with a great voice to walk you through his programs. I saw previews of this DVD so I'm surprised I'm a bit disappointed. The moves are fluid, creating flexibility and strength but it seemed long. The table position is tough. Usually I go through routines I like and the time flies. The bonus programs are very interesting and present different things to try. Don't forget to listen to the interviews of everyone he uses in the video - definitely a pleasant addition. I can't put my finger on it more specifically but this was my 1st go through. I will certainly try it a few more times and update my review.",1330214400,10,661,4.382113821138211
4521496,5,B0051F2AEI,If you like these two disiplines then this a the perfect blend for a great workout and the bonus featires bump it a notch.,1323648000,11,122,4.125

i have indeed received this product and it was a quick fast service! ive done the workout several times since its arrival. and i love it just like i knew i would. ive never bought a scott cole dvd that i didn't love! if you're a beginner or have a hard time with yoga this is great advanced material is on the dvd as well. but no other dvd out there combines yoga and tai chi.",1309564800,12,579,3.8739495798319328
4521499,4,B0051F2AEI,Good video for those who are looking to bring yoga and tai chi together. The instructions are straightforward and easy enough for beginners to also follow along. Offers a great workout and relieves stress in one session. Works even better if you have a designated area set for training.,1449964800,,286,4.857142857142857
4521500,5,B0051F2AEI,this is an excellent workout tape.  It really helps my balance and the stretching is great for the body.,1440547200,,104,4.473684210526316
4521501,5,B0051F2AEI,Excellent video. Very powerful.,1438646400,,31,7.0
4521502,5,B0051F2AEI,I have been recommending this DVD to all my friends and yoga instructors. Everyone should try this combo!,1436572800,,105,4.888888888888889
4521503,5,B0051F2AEI,"Scott Cole is one of my favorite fitness instructors of all time.  I tried a tai chi class before and found it to be tedious with too many sequential standing movements that were difficult for someone with back and/or feet issues (at the time).  I love yoga but thought this would probably not do it justice.  Not true at all!  Scott Cole has the best voice and timing and incorporates strength movements, vinyasa, tai chi energy-building movements and stretches in just the right portions and pace that you walk away feeling relaxed and energized at the same time.  It is more like therapy than exercise.  Ha ha.  It really lifts your mood and makes you feel ready to take on the world.  He is particularly delicate at incorporating information without sacrificing relaxation in closing, or savasana - if you are into yoga.  Any fitness level or age group could get something out of this workout with the modifications which leave room for growth as you progress.  I cant say enough about how impressed I am with this DVD.",1424822400,3,1023,4.696629213483146
4521504,4,B0051F2AEI,Scott Cole has a nice way of teaching and I need to get my flexibility back. I have not done the whole routine but I feel the results already.,1420761600,,142,3.9310344827586206
4521505,4,B0051F2AEI,Very high energy workout.,1413244800,,25,5.5
4521506,5,B0051F2AEI,I really enjoy this program.  This combination is perfect for beginning to moderate intensity.  I am not limber and was able to do this program even though it was challenging.  Scott Cole is entertaining and inspiring.,1409356800,,218,5.0
4521507,5,B0051F2AEI,"I read some of the reviews before buying this DVD and was a little doubtful that I would like it. But Scott Cole has done a very skillful blend of Tai Chi and Yoga. Having done both Tai Chi and Yoga for years, none of the movements were new to me but I don't think that someone new to these disciplines would have trouble following the movements.

 I hurt my back lifting a 5 gallon tub of paint into the trunk of my car and was looking for something that would help ease the pain. I started with Scott Cole's PM Tai Chi because that is always my ""go-to"" routine when I've hurt my back. I progressed to the Yoga Tai Chi routine once I felt that my back had healed enough that I wouldn't re-injure it with a slightly more strenuous routine. I was also going through an emotional period in my life at this time. This routine leaves me feeling stretched, relaxed, calm yet energized. The movements gently stretch and lubricate all the joints in your body. Scott also incorporates some core and strength work but not enough to consider this DVD as a ""workout."" If you've done Scott's PM Tai Chi in the past and are looking for something a little more challenging, you might consider his Yoga Tai Chi. The routine lasts for an hour so it is considerably longer than the PM Tai Chi, but IMO, I feel that the addition of the Yoga postures increases the flexibility and strength benefits without sacrificing the calming effects of doing Tai Chi alone. However, as much as l liked this routine, I can find myself getting bored with it. I need something a little more challenging when my body is working at full capacity. This DVD will maintain a prized position in my library for those days when I need something a little less taxing.",1398211200,4,1725,4.421383647798742
4521508,5,B0051F2AEI,I have his back care DVD and thrive on it. This is another great one! His DVDs are my mainstay.,1390089600,,95,3.8
4521509,5,B0051F2AEI,"The description on the back of this DVD says it best, ""enter the hall of harmony with breath-filled magnificence as you embark upon a miraculous mind/body/spirit journey with Scott Cole.""

Scott Cole blends yoga and tai chi into a gentle and uplifting workout that is suitable for any level.  I'm an advanced exerciser who needs workouts like this for my rest days.

Why I loved this DVD:

* Scott Cole.  What can I say?  His soothing voice, gentle demeanor and down to earth style are wonderful.

* The gentle flowing movements make my joints and my entire body feel good.  Unfortunately, I suffer from osteoarthritis in my hips and it can hurt to move.  These movements ease my pain.  My favorite move is the famous, ""monkey bear,"" where you shift your feet from side to side while moving your arms.  I could do this move all day long!

* The blending of yoga and tai chi.  I love both types of exercise and have found them to be life changers for me.  It's nice to have them combined into one workout.

* Scott's explanations of each move; he describes what it is and why we do it.

I like the first 20 minutes of this workout the best.  You are standing and moving.  I love how I can feel the energy gently moving through my body.  The seated exercises are nice, but they are very slow moving.  I plan to use this DVD for an evening workout to help me unwind from the day.",1386547200,21,1376,4.34251968503937
4521510,5,B0051F2AEI,"I'm out of shape from work / eat / sleep robot mode. Found a new job that leaves me a couple days off a week, so decided to try to get back into caring for myself. I think it's a wise idea to acknowledge I HAVE a body that needs care & nurturing. This seemed like a soft & gentle way to reacquaint with my body  , not just jump into high cardio where I will SURELY feel defeated in about 5 minutes and will lose hope of EVER regaining physical health.  On the first viewing ( not doing) I didn't think I'd like it. BUT on DOING it , I found great stretches even though my body is so stiff & inflexible ( Not to mention ALL my fat is in my belly- so look 8 months pregnant all the time and difficult to do things that require balance , reaching or lifting or breathing). I could actually DO them. And he is kind enough to remind you ALL bodies are shaped different ie  short torso/ long torso, legs , arms etc- just adjust to what ""sits"" right for you. I feel alert & relaxed & more focused after finishing it. MAybe after a few weeks I will even attempt the 3 BONUS work outs yoga, abs, tai chi.",1385078400,16,1095,3.9681818181818183
4521511,5,B0051F2AEI,"Scott is soothing, not overwhelming, making this exercise seem doable even when I don't feel like doing anything  too physical.",1375660800,,127,5.35
4521512,5,B0051F2AEI,"Never having taken a Tai Chi class before, I purchased this DVD to use in the comfort of my home. Scott Cole is an excellent teacher and makes it very easy to learn. I love him",1368057600,8,176,3.9166666666666665
4521513,5,B0051F2AEI,"I practice both tai chi and yoga on a daily basis and  really love this workout, a combination of  both.  One works to stress the muscles and the other for recovery. I always enjoy Scott Coles workouts as he does a great job teaching.",1360454400,3,234,4.2727272727272725
4521514,5,B0051F2AEI,"nice dvd, I bought several, as I have back issues, and this regime is helping me get stronger, highly recommend this and other DVD's by Mr Cole",1360368000,8,143,4.333333333333333
4521515,3,B0051F2AEI,"I practice Tai Chi and yoga regularly. So, this sounded like a nice blend.
Tai Chi forms are a little fast but it's a nice change of pace.  I've added this workout to one of many I do in the morning before starting my day.  I find I pop it into player about every 10 days or so. If you are a purist, this DVD is not for you.",1351036800,16,324,3.681159420289855
4521516,3,B0051F2AEI,"I do a lot of aerobic exercise but not enough stretching.  Thought this might be simple enough, but I am not far enough along to do all of it.  I do like the tempo but the floor segment for the leg/back stretches is too hard on my knees.",1333584000,5,237,3.9166666666666665
4521517,4,B0051F2AEI,"My husband loves this video, but it's a little too easy for me.  (We're both ""60ish"" and very active.)  It's good for relaxing and stretching, but maybe that's what it's intended for.  We both like Scott Cole.",1332115200,6,209,4.594594594594595

8452616,5,B0051F2AEI,Scott Cole carries you though an amazing meditative journey connecting your chi and your chakras with the universe. His combination of Tai Chi and Yoga is great for beginners and advanced practice.,1528243200,,197,5.1875
8452617,5,B0051F2AEI,"I'm one of those who've fooled myself into thinking I'm as healthy as I was in my youth, when I was active and physical.  I used to run, play sports and go to the gym in my 20's and 30's.  I'm 57 now and in my mind I feel I'm that same kid, even though I've gained weight and sit behind a desk all day.  I decided to get back into shape and purchased this DVD after reading several reviews, expecting someone like me would find it a proverbial walk in the park.  Within minutes, however, I realized just how fat, immobile and stiff I'd become.  It was a fairly earth shattering realization and I was horrified at how blind Id been to discover how far back Id slid.  Admitting defeat, and, since I live alone, I figured ""what the hell?  No one's going to see me making a fool of myself.  Its only been a month, but each day Ive made progress and finding more flexibility and better balance and already amazed at how much better I feel.  It doesnt hurt that suddenly friends are noticing somethings up and asking, are you going to the gym?
Im not an exercise vid kind of guy, and thought this would be corny, but Mr. Cole is the perfect teacher, and even over video only, makes me feel like Im being addressed personally and being paid attention to (how weird does that sound).  His positive energy and easy manner make the DVD feel more like it was done for me by a friend or acquaintance and that cant hurt.  I look forward to getting more of his videos and feeling even better!  Thank you, Scott Cole!",1509062400,4,1502,4.25
8452618,5,B0051F2AEI,"This is my second Scott Cole DVD. The first one is the reason I bought THIS one.  This new one combines both Yoga and Tai Chi and is a bit more extensive. So, as one of his colleagues on this DVD said she does, I use it at the first of the week. (I use my first Tai Chi DVD every day.)  Scott adds humor in his DVD's making ""us"" feel more at ease while initially learning the moves. He also explains how the moves are beneficial to the body. I am nearly 66, and feel a bit stiff from time to time, so these Yoga and Tai Chi movements are very beneficial in feeling better and healthier every day. I highly recommend Scott Cole!!!!",1507852800,,630,4.032
8452619,5,B0051F2AEI,"I LOVE this DVD. I am new to tai chi. I have done some yoga but not much. This is possible for me and I will grow with it. Scott is nice to look at and has a fun personality also. I enjoy it and I look forward to it. There are 3 bonus mini workouts also. 1 is yoga abs I saw a difference in my abs in 1 week, what a GREAT workout! 2nd Viniyasa yoga, is beautiful to see and participate in. 3rd is martial DU LA. It is a mini cardio exercise. It is short, perhaps meant for demonstration, but when I am short on time I will often to this twice and abs. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
This is an older DVD so it is not hi-def but this doesn't bother me. I recommend this product.",1476230400,,687,3.7777777777777777
8452620,5,B0051F2AEI,"This was a marvelous combination of Yoga and Tai Chi with a great  meditative ending sequence. Just the right balance of each to get a workout, stretch and Tai grounding.  Excellent hip flexibility sequences. Great way to start a day!",1474329600,2,234,4.825

The extra stuff was fluff. One mild ab workout that's added on the 'extra's but better than nothing I guess. I was expecting something more challenging. The video seemed a bit dark, their lighting was crap. Someone shining a flash light would have helped.",1463529600,,414,4.1875

8452625,5,B0051F2AEI,I had cervical spine surgery and this DVD is wonderful. I went at my own pace. It's not to slow and not to fast. My range of motion is getting better every day and I feel calmer and more relaxed afterwards.  100 recommend,1456272000,,221,4.1395348837209305
