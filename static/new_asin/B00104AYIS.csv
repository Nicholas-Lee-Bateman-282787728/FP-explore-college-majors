8236797,4,B00104AYIS,"I am still amazed that a ""public domain television on DVD"" company has released a budget priced DVD with two hour-long episodes of this popular comedy-variety  television series. Milton Berle was for several years the most popular person on television. The first episode on the disc features Gertrude Berg as guest star, playing her popular ""Molly Goldberg"" character. Gertrude was in fact the first Jewish actress to have her own popular TV series (""The Goldbergs""), but sadly very little of that series survives today. So this episode is worth seeing for that alone.
The second episode on the disc features Peter Lawford and Carol Channing as guests, with both of them spoofing themselves. The episode also features a spoof of ""What's My Line"" and a musical segment consisting of Carol Channing performing ""Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend"". Also features are a few of the original commercials for Buick.

Both of these episodes date from 1953, and although the picture quality is mediocre at best, the rare insight into 1950's televsion provided here is a must-see for both classic TV fans, and historians researching 1950's pop culture.",1244073600,10,1140,5.090909090909091
