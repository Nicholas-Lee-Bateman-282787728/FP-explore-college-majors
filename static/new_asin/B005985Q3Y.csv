4620698,5,B005985Q3Y,"Enjoyed it a lot. Real good content, and not opinionated. Research doesnt allways come from high dollar video and recording equipment. Highly recommend this.",1336176000,,157,5.583333333333333
4620699,5,B005985Q3Y,"This product is not the typical hyped TV show or Movie that has been developed for entertainment or ratings.  This DVD is true Bigfoot field research by a team who had dedicated over 5 years to locate, collect data, and educate people about the ellusive Bigfoot.  The footage is by the field researchers, not professional camera crews.  The team is there for the long haul, not the hit and run tactics used by many of the ""Big Names"" of Bigfoot Hunters.  This is not Bigfoot hunting, this is Bigfoot research.",1336089600,,509,4.622222222222222
4620700,1,B005985Q3Y,"A few people decided to go out into the woods of Arizona and use a standard VHS camera, yes a VHS camera (in 2008)to document some made-up foot prints of a Sasquatch.  The dialog, sound mixing and story line are just plain bad. It's almost worth renting for $1.99 to see how badly some things can be produced.",1333584000,3,309,4.327586206896552
4620701,5,B005985Q3Y,"This is the first and the best documentary that really shows Bigfoot Research as it really is.  I like they way that it is not glamorized much like the Bigfoot TV shows.  It is lots of hard work, and then lost of sheer terror when you find something.  These guys worked hard at it, and I hope there is much more to come.",1315612800,,320,4.0476190476190474
4620702,2,B005985Q3Y,"This looks like it was geared towards Grade School Kids. I thought I was watching a Story Recital where an Adult Read to Kids with Still Photos and Maps. The Actual Cam Footage was annoying to watch due to the distortion and moving about and the VHS Footage was not tracked right leaving a static line in the upper area of the picture. This wasn't the worst Bigfoot Documentary that I watched but it isn't the Best Either. The Supposed Researchers should invest in better camcorders or at least modern ones. These Old Camcorders that were used, are terrible on the viewer. The running time is 59 Min.",1315008000,2,600,4.564814814814815

8462842,1,B005985Q3Y,"I bought this DVD a couple of yrs ago was a big waste of money and a huge disappointment I could put up a tent in my backyard and have someone barefooted walk around it and claim it was Bigfoot. There was absolutely no evidence at all in this movie not even in the so called caves. I do believe Bigfoot exists from my own encounter had 3 other people w me that shared the experience but it's people like this that make a mockery of those of us that have had encounters. If I was like these people I could go back to that place w a video camera film footprints that r clearly human and look into the woods claiming the shadows from light is where a Bigfoot is looking at us. I'll say the same thing here as I do w the finding Bigfoot episodes....not every sound u hear in the woods is Bigfoot!!!! Don't waste ur time or money on this disappointing DVD, and to Mr Marcum if ur gonna make a Bigfoot documentary u need to have actual evidence in it w eyewitness accounts to support areas u are searching preferably those accounts in the video if the eyewitnesses don't want their faces shown or voices recorded there are ways u can include them in the video w/o showing their faces and distorting their voice.",1445472000,,1205,4.243478260869566

8462844,1,B005985Q3Y,"I admire the Waite family for their passion and dedication to research in Arizona. They have probably dedicated themselves to more outdoor research time than many other well known researchers, however, for those who are expecting a video packed with irrefutable evidence that supports the existence of Sasquatch, keep searching. This, and many of the other videos made by this family, are extremely poor quality and filmed almost entirely with a handheld camera. Watching a video filmed with a handheld without use of stability support can be extremely difficult to watch, especially with the camera operator adding his personal comments while capturing video of dark spots in the trees. I have watched hours of video from this group of amature reseachers and have yet to see one thing that can be confused with actual evidence. This video is no different. I personally do not see any evidence in this video and I managed to watch it to the end.

Don't get me wrong, there are many researchers that sit at home on their computer talking about how they can do a better job themselves without ever getting outdoors. I admire their efforts, but I feel as though I have been robbed by spending money on this video. And be careful because this family has many similar videos.

If the Waite family has produced real evidence since this videos, I apologize, but from what I saw from the first handful of videos they made, I feel very disappointed.",1429315200,,1440,4.825910931174089
8462845,3,B005985Q3Y,"I liked the information... Needs better edits. They repeat themselves a lot... Its mainly one guy talking. Which is also the camera man. Soo it seems very unprofessional. But they do find interesting structures in the woods... Not sure where they where half the time.. They never said.. Or didn't say enough and the technic they used was same as always... Trail cams, someone videoing and walking through the woods...all in all... It might just be worth it.....IF!.. You don't care about all that and you think Bigfoot rocks... If so? Go for it!.",1418601600,,546,4.819148936170213

8462847,1,B005985Q3Y,"What kind of Lowlife leaves an awesome review on his product in hopes that someone will read his review and think the DVD is worth buying? Michael Waite is one such lowlife. I grew up in the White Mountains of AZ and the Mogollon area, and know of no such monster.",1378684800,,264,4.196078431372549
8462848,2,B005985Q3Y,"The video was of subpar quality, due to the amateur photographers. Overall not a very good video. Will be looking for a better quality video.",1361664000,2,141,4.68
8462849,2,B005985Q3Y,Yep...Part 1.  Can't even imagine how there could be a Part 2.  I didn't learn a thing from this one.  I think I wasted my time on this flick!,1353369600,3,142,3.8275862068965516
8462850,1,B005985Q3Y,"This is amateurish on every level. The ""documentary"" is nothing more than someone with a camcorder claiming every noise, blur, shadow and fallen branch has something to do with bigfoot. The book ""The Mogollon Monster - Arizona's Bigfoot"" may be the worst book ever written on the subject as well. These ""docs"" are for completionists only and to be brutally honest add absolutely nothing to any legitimate research on the subject. At least Tom Biscardi productions offer some sort of entertaining value.",1351728000,,502,5.134146341463414
