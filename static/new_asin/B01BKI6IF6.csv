7657347,5,B01BKI6IF6,"This crime drama is set in Iceland in a very small town which is in a harbor. A ferry has just made it into port from Denmark with 300 passengers. Soon a blizzard begins to fall and the ferry cannot head back to Denmark until the storm passes.  The town's main road has become impassable. There is snow and ice everywhere in huge quantities and the townspeople are used to that. So this is a very claustrophobic mystery show but the townspeople are better at weathering it than the ferry people.

During all of this, a mutilated,  dismembered body washes to shore. The man was murdered only hours ago. There is thus a killer sealed into the town as well and they all know it. Will the killer go after more of them?

The local police chief is Andri Olafssun. His personal life is upside down as he currently cares for his daughters as his wife took off for the big city and another man. She makes it into town with her boyfriend right as the town closes. Her parents are also still in this town.

One event after another unfolds, each sinister in its own right. There are a lot of people in this town who have done bad things which they've kept hidden. Their relationships have always been on the edge. But sealed into town together, their troubled lives bubble to the surface one after another. The ferry, however, has brought its own set of troubles.

The police chief has his hands full. He is the most able on his staff. Controlling his two helpers is half the battle of his job. &Oacute;lafur Darri &Oacute;lafsson plays him and he is terrific. He is the one in the center of the box cover with the beard.

This is filmed in Icelandic language with English subtitles. Presently it cannot be played in a machine which only plays USA dvds. It recently streamed in the UK and should be streaming in America shortly.",1467158400,79,1816,4.451807228915663

7657354,5,B01BKI6IF6,"This is a really great series. Interesting story of corruption and murder in a small Icelandic town in the grip of a winter . Beautifully filmed acted and written.  I love watching actors who are 'unknown' to me and seem like real people. The subtitles don't get in the way and the dialogue is not so lengthy or convoluted than one can't keep up with it and watch the pictures.
If you don't speak Icelandic, that is!

7657356,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Trapped is an excellent, suspenseful mystery that keeps you constantly guessing about the next piece of the puzzle, and I'm the type who usually has the conclusion figured in the first five minutes.  The first episode has some nudity, but only one brief instance appears after that, as I recall.  Minimal violence and a few bits of gore appear.  In addition to the strong writing and stellar actor performances, Trapped captures the longing and vastness of Icelandic tales, history, and culture.",1528329600,,495,5.08641975308642

7657364,4,B01BKI6IF6,"I don't watch many shows with subtitles, but I started watching this because I loved Fortitude so much. If you like this show, I bet you'll like Fortitude too!

Great acting, solid casting, mysterious setting, beautiful photography, moody music, intriguing story line, etc. And the characters have loads of charisma. They really came alive. I felt I really got to know the main characters. The final image of Andri walking away from the camera made me sad in that I will miss him. What more can I say?

7657371,2,B01BKI6IF6,"OK. We watched all episodes. Throughout all 10 of them there is not a single laugh or purely joyful moment. What? Do real people, all people in remote Iceland, live with no joyful or light moments? Thats not dark art, thats suicidal! Critics might praise it as ultra artsy, ultra deep and profound. To me, it was near comatose. One technical matter, when the worst of a blizzard and avalanche hits, the bear of a town detective walks considerable distances without gloves or a hat of any kind. Sorry, thats too outrageous to believe.",1523145600,,533,4.680851063829787
7657372,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Brilliant multi-layered writing. Icelandic shows are becoming increasingly popular and this show is a perfect example of why. You won't regret watching it.  The only downside? Not enough episodes and I have to wait too long for the next season.
While some of my family members hate subtitled shows/movies, they actually loved this and didn't mind the subtitles.  I would recommend this as it has a bit of everything: suspense, sketchy-ness, love, hate, dishonor, betrayal, lies, painful truths & beyond.  I can't use much in the way of descriptive language because this is honestly something to watch in order to appreciate the complex nature of the acts, and actors portraying the individualistic odd behaviours of being isolated and the actors themselves.  The actors are brilliant in their roles.  You'll recognize a few from British telly but honestly would love to see a lot more of them.",1523145600,,893,5.089041095890411
7657373,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Icelandic dramas have become my go to for a good, solid story.  Trapped is so good! I will tell you this, not all stories have a happy ending.

7657376,4,B01BKI6IF6,"What a great story. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. The gentleman playing the sherif, Andri, was a great character.

7657377,5,B01BKI6IF6,"The characters are SO human and believable!  The story takes a while to develop - perhaps that's a metaphor for how the characters have to move in such a frozen place?  But their likability and flaws flavor the story well, and the mystery is a good one.

This show has been on my watch list for a while - I should have watched it when I first tagged, but then I would have been waiting an eternity for the 2nd season. This way I only have to wait a few more months.  These characters aren't actors - they are real people, and we just got lucky enough to see into their lives for a bit.

Living in the US I bought a multi-region DVD a few years ago because certain anime was only available in PAL format.

7657387,5,B01BKI6IF6,Loved the understated yet intense acting. The story keeps you hooked and sucks you in. I finished it and I already miss andri and his crew.

7657392,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Nothing like watching a murder mystery set in a freezing cold Icelandic winter!  I loved this series, watching it all wrapped up in blankets by my woodstove this winter.  Enjoyed the character development and listening to the Icelandic language.  Can't wait for more....",1521072000,,270,5.232558139534884
7657393,5,B01BKI6IF6,Extremely well written and acted with a good cast. I forget I am watching with sub titles as it is so engrossing. Not overdone as so many movies are today. Also nice scenery. Love this and highly recommended.,1520985600,,208,4.5
7657394,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Everyone in Trapped is trapped -- in very different ways, of course. There are geographic, weather-related, interpersonal, and political traps, ahd the police must work their way through them to solve the crime. The lead character and the other two police officers are all well portrayed, and I found myself caring what happened to them. The pace is measured and the settings detailed -- I had never seen Iceland before and enjoyed that aspect of the show. I didn't mind the subtitling, either, which I sometimes do. This reminds me of Shetland, if it took place in Iceland. If you're patient and let the story unfold you will be well rewarded for your time.",1520899200,,658,4.780701754385965

7657398,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Absolutely superlative! The acting alone would deserve five stars and I wasn't bothered by the subtitles; better to hear the actors' real voices and the emotions in those voices. The story itself was fresh and even with so many things happening all around, everything came together in the end. And much like real life, there weren't many happy endings (just one character I could be truly happy for) but at least there were resolutions.",1520553600,,436,4.905405405405405

I can recall when a murder in my small home town rocked the community and people began locking their doors.  This is a FOREIGN film at its finest that most Cowboy action/ murder drama Americans would not appreciate...I am American BTW.  But I find if you view things with an open mind then you can find the little gems always.  I was fascinated that we see a film with Icelandic language then I can watch it again and again and learn some dialect.  And it was a story of twists and turns  A great  who dun it.  and suspenseful reveal...My wife HATES watching whodunits with me as I can usually figure out the culprit within the first 5 minutes of american dramas.  But this?  magnificent.  If you like films like The usual Suspects, or Presumed Innocent type long drawn out investigations...(which is what really happens in REAL LIFE)  and the Police elites being made fools of by the local chief who has been in the game and knows a thing or two about actual police work... then you should love this show...

Complain all you want about subtitles but I tell you true, you'll be missing out on one of the best who-done-it dramatic series to come out in ages.

I really hope a Season 2 is in the works.",1516579200,,358,4.343283582089552
7657416,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I was fortunate to find this series for streaming in the US, where the rights are owned by the now hated Weinstein Company.  (For me having to see their logo at the start of the Episode was probably the biggest drawback!)  Because it was streamed on Amazon Prime, I didn't have to deal with the difficulties of the DVD format and because I only needed the subtitles for English, I had no problem whatsoever with the format, so my experience and this review is based on the content, which I found truly impressive.

There are a lot of similar mystery-crime-police procedural series out there that use the same general setting and format.  A horrible crime is committed in a small, isolated, close knit community with secrets and a damaged outsider detective and his team are going to get to the bottom of it while uncovering the towns many secrets.  A lot of these have been made in Britain (eg Broadchurch) and a lot have been made in Scandinavian settings (The Bridge, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and some of the more damaged versions of Wallander). In fact, the original series of Fortitude, which is British TV series in a Scandinavian setting has exactly the same murder in a snowed in town premise as this series, but was a HUGE disappointment for me in that it ditched the murder mystery premise to become a B-movie sci-fi horror flick.

I am happy to report that not only does Trapped not go there, but it actually tells a mostly realistic story with mostly realistic people.  It may not be perfect, but it is much more emotionally satisfying than most of the genre.  I can't speak for whether the characters represent ""True Icelanders"" but they are written with believable motives, actions, and flaws for the most part.  You still get an overall good vs evil vibe, but the individual characters are allowed to have flaws and sometimes even independent thought.  As has been said in many reviews the three characters in the local police team are very appealing and it would be wonderful to see more of them. I would hope that the second series investigates both their past and their future selves.

I came away form Broadchurch underwhelmed and a little depressed, and from Fortitude downright disgusted.  This isn't perfect, but it's much more satisfying than most of what's out there in the tortured detective, quirky small town with secrets genre.

I do wish I could get the rest of my family to watch it, so I could discuss it with them.  I guess that's one place where the long format (10 episodes) and the necessity of reading subtitles makes it difficult.  I had no problem watching it on a handheld tablet in bed, but it's not going to be something you can put on TV while you fold clothes just because of the format.

Some of the plot twists strain a bit, but the story is solidly grounded in plausible everyday events.  The Icelandic weather and the town are both important ""characters"" in the story; by the conclusion, you feel as if you're a towns person as well.  The bittersweet ending is entirely logical and not forced at all, and will leave you wishing for ""Trapped 2"" with the same police force investigating a new case.",1515542400,,648,4.657894736842105

After reading the few negative reviews this series received, I believe there are people who think they are demanding film critics and nothing will satisfy their discerning eye.

Acting across the board was excellent.  If you liked the series ""Fortitude"" (which I did, season 1 only, because of Tucci), this is that, supersized and 100X better.  In that series I did not like any of the characters, (except for Tucci's because he made the character likeable).  I'm not sure if that was intentional or not but I despised them all.  In this series, every character was interesting, and you can really start to care for some of them, very deeply.

7657439,5,B01BKI6IF6,"As a follower of Bron-Broen, and lesser so, Forbrydelsen (The Killing), Borgen, Bedrag (Follow the Money) (all Nordic dramas, particularly Danish ones), I was anticipating Trapped to be an intense crime drama, and was not disappointed. In fact it was so gripping, I was uncapable to watch only one episode per day, as per my plan. Each hour left me on the edge of  a virtual ""private icelandic fjord seat, and I could not stop myself from pressing the Amazon Prime Next-Up button. I speak Danish and the Icelandic language is similar, so I think they did a good, if not totally accurate, job with the subtitles. Often the dialogue is extremely sparse, but the subtitles more descriptive. The characters in this claustrophobic little fjord village all know each other so well, it seems like there is a kind of group telepathy, so very few words need spoken to convey much deep, yet intentionally suppressed, expression. In fact ones favorite characters are the most taciturn, Andri and Hinritta of the Loregnen/Police. In no time one finds that the people who do the most smalltalk are perhaps untrustworthy. We watched the series during a deep freeze with the winds howling at windows and frosty beach tides churning, so the scenes of the avalanches and frozen coastlines were spine tingling. Highly recommended winter viewing, this 10 part saga is bone-chilling and memorable. Fortunately they are releasing a season 2 in winter of 2018.",1514419200,4,1438,4.966804979253112

7657488,4,B01BKI6IF6,"I am a fan of the genre and there is much to recommend this series, however it relies more than it should on inexplicable moments of idiocy or incompetence on the part of several characters. There is an unintentional and decidedly non-comedic ""Keystone Kops go to Iceland"" aspect to it which I found almost unbearable in the early episodes and again presents itself near the conclusion. These problems are not confined to the constabulary, and as I think about, even the existence of the core mystery of the show relied on a remarkably stupid decision.

Having said that, as mentioned, there is much to recommend it. It is very well-cast and well-acted. The character development is outstanding and the dialogue feels authentic. The production values are solid (I saw one review describe it as an Icelandic home movie, which makes no sense to me). The location is both well-chosen and well-presented: a great job of capturing the sense of place. Even the overarching plot was quite interesting and fairly original. The effort should have been expended to move the story forward without relying on ""what are you thinking?"" moments.

I look forward to the second season planned for 2018 and am hopeful that the writers will make the effort to tell their story without impugning the intelligence of Icelanders.",1509494400,,1307,4.963470319634703
7657489,4,B01BKI6IF6,"Another of those bleak Nordisk dramas.  This one is a bit more intelligent and less sensational than those 'Girl' movies.  Although it all unfolds slowly, this is perfectly fitting to the season and the surroundings.  It has scant charm yet it holds interest even without holiday visuals.  Hard to say what it is that makes it work.  The moral strength of the police chief, maybe.

7657491,5,B01BKI6IF6,"It's extremely engrossing, with a central character who is not someone an American TV show could create. The weakness is that gee, when this town decided to go bad, they went really, really bad. It is sort of a smorgasbord of crime, victimization, and the complex webs of conspiracy. There's a certain amount of emotional padding, especially around the young, sad boy who is a character, but really isn't much more than a prop.

Trapped seems to prove how formulaic and predictable American TV, especially the detective genres. There's not much tech in this. There are many layers to this drama, notably the press and how the press changes things, shifts things. It's a very cynical view of the press, and it's almost funny when the press speculates that maybe a prisoner on a helicopter didn't jump.

This is really a show about a lot of relationships. The whole town is rotten with bad relationships. The whole Federal police department is dragged down with bad blood and strange politics.  The town is a place of many horrors, probably way too many to be believable.

The backdrop of the town, the fjord, and the weather is exceptional. The filming is remarkable, with a lot of nicely arranged shots. I complain about 10 inches of snow, but I guess never again.

I know there is a second season slotted for 2018. I hope it is even better, since the characters are really very good.  It was a bummer to see the Weinstein logo at the beginning. They own the US rights apparently. Well, another layer of corruption?",1509321600,,1515,4.69811320754717

It actually is more like the California noir of Raymond Chandler or Ross MacDonald. The crimes are those of greed and self-delusion, and the hero is never going to get recognition or reward because he is the moral compass of the story. The acting is superb, I especially appreciated Ilmur Kristjnsdttir, but really it was the whole ensemble.

7657561,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I just love icelandic literature and films- the land and people are so different than what we normally see everyday in America.  This series takes place in a tiny, rural port town locked in the mountains and sitting on the edge of a deadly icy sea.  The main character is outsider, Chief Police Andri.  He has moved to this little town to run away from a case-gone-bad in the larger city of Reykjavik.  A dismembered body is discovered by a fishing vessel just as a large ferry comes to town.  Andri and his three man police force must deal with the body alone because a major snow storm strikes at the same time.  The trouble happens as they begin their investigation- more deaths take place which completely unsettle the town who has never before experienced such back to back violence of this nature.  They are cut off from hospitals, technology and manpower they need to deal with the body and murders that ensue.  The entire Season 1 is dedicated to solving the mystery. The skies are iron grey most of the time and the people, hard to read.  The makers of Trapped beautifully convey what life in a small town in Iceland must be like- the people all know each other and the families have relationships that go back hundreds of years.  Dark secrets run underneath the placid stillness of the place- secrets only the native Icelanders know.  The makers treat their audience with respect, understanding that we don't need dumb cues, overt music or blatant foreshadowing to understand what is happening.  Just be patient and let this 8 course meal serve itself to you!  You will sucked right into this little town and be left... well, I will let you see.",1506211200,,1655,4.626712328767123
7657562,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I have a soft spot in my heart for ""Fortitude"", another crime thriller/drama set in icy Scandinavia. That is also about murder and strange happenings in a remote, small town that seemed peaceful.

The thing is, after a certain point, ""Fortitude"" didn't make much sense. ""Trapped"" is a straightforward drama without the hard to believe science fiction elements.

The performances are stellar. The actor who plays the police chief (I remember him from ""Emerald City"") and the actress who plays his deputy are particularly outstanding. Sadly, the deputy, Henrika, is the only woman who comes across well. The other married women in the town are basically loose. The police chief's ex is especially loathsome. She's so awful, I don't know why he would want her back.

While the women engage in personal treachery, the men engage in all out crimes. Secrets from the past start coming to the surface. Then, the town is isolated by a snow storm and things go from bad to worse.

This is definitely binge-worthy.",1506211200,,1004,4.923076923076923

I didn't care about anybody's fire, murder, dismemberment, fondness for peeping, date rape, rotten sadistic little girls, or avalanche, because it was all meaningless.

You couldn't ask for the main characters in the Police Chief and his officers having any better chemistry than this one.  Plus the twist and turns through all the episodes was absolutely amazing and hats off to some awesome writers on this one as well.
Truly one of the best shows I've watched in a very long time and I just thought when I began the show it would be kind of boring, but when it got going it kept you wondering what was coming next and who was involved with what.

The only bad thing is there doesn't seem to be another season soon.",1505520000,,429,5.417910447761194
7657585,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Awesome show. It starts out pretty slow, pretty much like you would imagine Iceland to be. But by around episode 4 or 5, it grabs you and you can't stop watching. There is really terrific action across the board, starting with Andri, the police chief in a small fjord town of Iceland vying for a Chinese port to be built. His colleagues Hinritta and Aesgir are also terrific - especially Hinritta who gives you this ""I ain't taking your bs"" look as well as any actor I've seen. The collection of townspeople also give awesome performances, especially Eisgir, Andri's father in law, whose daughter is involved in a fire that starts the show. It takes a village, and in this town, you're never sure who is good or not. Bring in a huge car ferry from Denmark, with a mysterious crew, and the tension picks up. This story has terrific subplots that all play into the main plot - who dunnit. At times, Andri and his team seem like Andy and Barney from Mayberry RFD, but then, spurred on by the relatively incompetent Reykjavik police chief, the get their act together and do some really great work. One of the most interesting subplots is Andri's relationship with his either separated or ex-wife and her boyfriend who arrive in town. Plus Andri still lives at her parent's home, further adding tension because the wife wants to take their two girls away from them back to Reykjavik.

There is fantastic scenery of snowy mountains and a desolate, mysterious fjord. But pretty much, it's a bleak, snowy town, small but mysterious, in the middle of nowhere. Plenty of mystery lies beneath what you see. I really hope for a season two, with this same outstanding cast. I would have never expected such great acting from Iceland, and such a terrifc storyline. If you can get thru the first few episodes, you won't regret it.",1505520000,,1815,4.654205607476635

You're totally invested in all of the characters, and as you learn all of the dynamics of the residents, and whose history intertwines with whose, you're continually re-formulating your theories. The ten episodes flew by, and I was legit relieved to read that production on season 2 has already started.

Bonus: If you like to see a smart, fearless, capable woman on the case (like in ""The Bridge"" and ""The Killing""), Hinnrika (played by Ilmur Kristjnsdttir) is perfection. (I did a deep dive and learned she's also an Icelandic politician!)",1505260800,,804,5.129770992366412

7657605,4,B01BKI6IF6,"""Trapped"" was a surprisingly pleasant find! First, this show continues the interesting trend of setting crime dramas in unusual locales: Northern Ireland, a Scandinavian arctic research station, and now Iceland. Second, this show features people who feel real: none of those surreal beauties from Hollywood, but actual humans. Consequently, the characters are better and more believable. Third, the characters mess up, but also the insights are spread among the characters. It feels more like a normal human drama, and less of the crime-fighting superhero Hollywood is so fond of. Fourth, what a surprise to discover the bear-like &Oacute;lafur Darri &Oacute;lafsson who plays the central character, Andri. Despite wearing a bushy beard that hides most of his features, this guy's combination of hangdog stress and dogged persistence results in one of the best characters I have seen in a long time! The show also avoids jumping the shark, which a lot of those placed in exotic locales have done. Instead, the characters are involved in an unfortunate series of stressful, but believable events that forms a crucible from which long-standing undercurrents are forced to the surface, necessitating the responses of our imperfect protagonists. Throughout, suspense is kept high without the typical device of flogging the plot in ridiculous directions (with one contrived exception involving a character starting his own dangerous avalanche, which conveniently occupied an episode but felt too contrived, thus costing a star). I hope these folks can make more like this: intelligent, human and suspenseful.

7657618,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Season 1 of Trapped is a unique, intriguing, attention-riveting show.  It is dark film at its best, from the cold, wintery Icelandic landscape, to the deep, complicated relationships among the citizens of the small coastal village (Seyisfjrur), to the building tension and confusion as more bodies drop, to the minimalist dialog.  Most of it is in Icelandic with subtitles, but because these Icelanders are not particularly talkative people, it is easy to follow (I was knitting the whole time I watched the series over the course of a few evenings and did not miss a word, or a stitch!).  In addition, there's quite a bit of dialog in English.  So if you're not a fan of foreign language films, you should still enjoy this one.  I forgot I was reading subtitles: the plot was so intriguing, with the dialog just enough to keep me on track with the story.

The characters drive the story.  They are complex, human, none is all ""good"" or all ""bad"", and played by fabulous actors I'd not seen before: each is remarkable in his or her ability to portray deep emotions merely through facial expressions.  Body language is subtle (everyone is bundled up in bulky hand-knit sweaters and parkas most of the time).  There are moments of wry humor, contributed especially by the smart, fearless female police officer Hinrika (Ilmur Kristjnsdttir).  But the lead character, police chief Andri Olafsson, played by lafur Darri lafsson, is riveting. He is a 6'5"", probably 300+ lb, bear of a man--a deeply sad character due to estrangement from his wife (he still wears his wedding ring) and a traumatic experience as a city police officer before he arrived in Seyisfjrur.  He is repressed, terse, determined to do his job well, yet nevertheless wears his heart on his sleeve.  lafsson is an actor to watch--I will be looking for other films he's been in.

A couple of responses to complaints by other reviewers: exposed breasts in the opening scenes, and an alleged similarity to the series Fortitude.  RE nudity, it's a matter of sensibility.  I don't mind it, and in this case it's very short (maybe 15 seconds) and simply there, I believe, to demonstrate the happy-go-lucky love of a couple of teenagers escaping their parents' watchful eyes. There is nothing salacious or even particularly erotic. These scenes are directly linked to the series' plot lines; they provide the foundation for all that comes after.

RE if you've seen Fortitude, you've seen Trapped: no, you haven't.  Both shows have a lot of cold weather and snow in them, a minor plotline of tourism development, and a mystery.  Otherwise, they are completely different: very different mysteries, different kinds of characters, different development of characters and plot, somewhat sci-fi (Fortitude) vs. gritty real life (Trapped), and the list of differences goes on. And there are no polar bears in Trapped.  I liked Fortitude a lot, but it's a shallower, not as tightly conceived or as richly developed show.  Trapped captured my attention like Fortitude did not.

I've read that there will be a Season 2 even darker and more complicated than Season 1.  It's hard to imagine a second season as good as the first, but I'll be watching to find out.",1504656000,2,3208,4.901851851851852

A quiet little town in the bleak but beautiful landscape of Iceland suddenly cut off from the outside, dismembered corpse, international intrigue, mafia sex trafficking, complex family conflicts, inept interfering bureaucrats, surprising twists and turns of events, and the struggling, but competent and determined, three-person police department left to figure it all out.

7657633,5,B01BKI6IF6,Wow!  One of the best I have seen this year on either Amazon or Netflix.  Totally a binge watch.  Acting was superb and plot has some twists.  I have to admit I feel for the hero.  The lady who played the police  woman stole it.  Do not let the language bother you..it was awesome,1504396800,,280,4.074074074074074

7657637,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Brilliantly plotted and paced, this whodunit will keep you guessing until the big reveal, as all good mysteries should.

7657642,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Outstanding!!
I happened upon this gem of a film and got hooked right away.  The flow of the story is very similar to Fortitude but different enough that I did not get bored and, in fact, liked it even more.  I am now really going to look into Icelandic cinema more.  Having been to Iceland, it loved seeing Reykjavik scenes that were familiar.",1504396800,,344,4.428571428571429

7657647,4,B01BKI6IF6,hopefully there will be another season.  I had to read the words but the words spoken were not CC and with the accent hard to understand.  I love stories about Iceland as my aunt was from there.  i often know by the accent on english words where they come from.  So i just love the setting too.  The ship was amazing in the mystery.

7657653,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I absolutely loved this series, it is very well crafted from beginning to end. The 10 episodes all follow an arc (the first episode is very important to the rest of the story) and I felt engrossed by the story throughout -even with subtitles. It has suspense and action, the human story of each characters is also well developed. The actors are great, very real and human, no chirurgically enhanced Holywood actresses here. Lastely, the scenery is just gorgeous. Highly recommend!",1504224000,,480,4.938271604938271
7657654,4,B01BKI6IF6,"Not bad, but no sympathetic characters for me. I got a feeling that all characters are basically very similar psychologically and act in very similar ways. May be that's because they are all relatives on the small island. :) Anyway this series definitely worth watching. The story is good. I did not like the ending and main character's wife. I think she was acting in a very selfish manner and he was too tolerant and spineless.",1504224000,,429,4.657894736842105

7657656,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Outstanding ! A complex and fascinating plot, revealing new characters and twists with each episode. I loved it ! I also loved the unhollywood style of casting with realistic, flawed and likable people.

More mysteries like this will make me very happy ! Thanks Iceland for the second series that I absolutely loved.",1504137600,,316,4.962264150943396
7657657,5,B01BKI6IF6,"One of the best things about Amazon Fire Tv is the variety of programming. Just began watching this series and it is really good. The uniqueness of the local, storyline, acting is excellent. The bleak, harsh environment creates the perfect backdrop for the storyline. My only question is, will there be more? Amazon wows us with great programming but can't seem to follow through and deliver more than a season or two of most series. It's a shame because viewers are giving rave reviews and hungry for more quality programming. This is subtitled, which I don't mind. Got so involved I forgot about the subtitles.",1504051200,2,612,4.838095238095238

7657660,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Excellent! I found this Icelandic adventure to be highly entertaining and suspenseful.  I watched the entire season in 4 or 5 days- I can't even remember. But by the time I finished, the characters were like friends and family and I was so moved by their journey through the emotion and resulting deaths and heartbreak which were amplified by the struggles found in snow and ice.  Big thumbs up! Don't let the language inhibit your decision to watch.  The acting and emotion carries you through.",1504051200,,495,4.8

7657666,4,B01BKI6IF6,"This series was compelling.  I rushed through the watching of it very quickly, almost an episode a day.  The main characters, Andri and Hinrika, were complex and charismatic. (Some Reddit afficionado should post a photo montage of Hinrika's facial expressions -- I'm certain it would go viral). The Icelandic backdrop was different and expertly integrated with the story. Ditto the music. Occasionally there were plot points that were contrived, most notably the avalanche segment. Silly and gratuitous, as though they needed to fill one more episode than the meat of the story allowed for. A pivotal piece of evidence was obtained by an instance of sheer chance so unlikely that it lacked credibility and diminished the story.  But that's reaching for criticism to make because all in all, this was very well done.",1503878400,,815,5.112781954887218
7657667,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Different. Gripping. Captivating. Brilliant!

The tone of the show, somber, calm, yet full of character depth and brilliant acting, weaves the viewer through an intricate game of chess.
Although the storyline divides between the expected 'good v bad', the premise of the story is where Trapped absolutely shines!
I don't recall the last police/investigative show I've seen where guns are an extreme afterthought, so extreme that there aren't any until the last episode. Even then, the use of firearms is marginal. Overall, the use of violence, gratuitous or necessary, was kept to an absolute minimum. While some outcomes were predictable, the way the show arrived at the predictions was very well done.
I'm absolutely looking forward to Season 2!",1503878400,,747,5.277310924369748
7657668,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Totally enjoyed this whole series.  The environs were like another character.  Then you had this somewhat fat cop and you are like 'what?' And then everything gels.

It's got everything; greed, power, heroes, villains, and all are regular people in this close knit community making sometimes God like decisions....who will fall and who will survive here?

There was brilliant use of Icelandic conditions and the pace of events to fully present all the varied elements that underlined the title, ""Trapped.""

The actors are fabulous and bring the characters to life (I also now have a big crush on the lead actor Olafur Olafsson). There is no obviously gratuitous gore as in most American shows, and every episode builds steadily toward the main plot without becoming confusing.  The scenery and lighting are gorgeous.  The only thing that felt out of synch about Trapped is its title; it is overly simplistic and does nothing to draw viewers in to watch the show.

Above all the acting is tremendous... from the lead to the smallest of parts, the believability and occasional agony as the story progressed, makes the title ""Trapped"" true on so many levels.",1503187200,,392,4.909090909090909

7657719,4,B01BKI6IF6,"This is a very engrossing mystery set in a remote, isolated port in Iceland. A body is found, but before the big city police can arrive, the town is snowed in and the residents are trapped... with a murderer loose among them.  I truly enjoyed watching and highly recommend the series. However, it loses one star because of technical difficulties!  They really need to dub it in English or fix the captions (sub-titles).  They whip on and off the screen so quickly you can't possibly read them all.  And who's the genius that decided to use white sub-titles for a film set in winter in Iceland?  The words disappear against the snowy white background all too frequently.",1503187200,,669,4.683760683760684

7657721,4,B01BKI6IF6,"It was good, but a little to slow and dragged out for me. It maybe could have been condensed into fewer episodes. The acting was good, especially the police chief character (Andri). There wasn't a lot of suspense; it was more just a mystery with several different threads, all connected, and how the police detectives figured it all out little by little.",1503187200,,354,4.725806451612903
7657722,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I loved this show so much I ended up binge watching the whole season in 1 weekend.  If you're looking for a flashy American detective show with lots of explosions and car chases, this isn't it, but if you like realistic, flawed characters, excellent cinematography, and a good mystery and don't mind subtitles, you will enjoy this.
Other reviewers have given 1 star reviews because there was nudity, so be warned, there is nudity in the opening scene, but it's brief, and that was the only nudity in all of the episodes.  If you're planning on watching this with kids, there are definite adult themes in this (domestic violence, adultery, human trafficking, and oh yeah, murder) so the very brief nudity would be the least of my concerns.",1503100800,,738,4.7578125

Euroopean, Scandanavian and Arctic detective and crime shows are some of my favorites. Wow. What great productions. I hope this comes back for a second season. I loved the lead character and his female buddy-cop. Her character really developed in the second half of the series. It's always wonderful, too, to see what parts of the world are like that are so far from one's own. International tv shows are making us much more in touch with all kinds of people and places. It's what I love about the Internet, too.",1503014400,2,660,4.64957264957265
7657732,5,B01BKI6IF6,"A taut thriller depicting how the global greed and corruption that came to a head in 2008 seeped into the very fabric of the most remote and innocent persons and places. Brilliantly shot, capturing the real horror of a major blizzard and the stark majesty of the Icelandic landscape, and featuring great performances by  leads and supporting players alike. The depth of psychological exploration reminded me of Bergman.",1503014400,,419,5.161764705882353

7657741,4,B01BKI6IF6,"Well, that was pretty good. Good actors, wonderful to see something of Iceland. It's a complicated plot, several different crimes linked through the people involved. Just when you think the story is about this awful crime over here, something happens over there that doesn't seem related. But it all comes together in the end. Very much better than those boring ones like ""Top of the Lake,"" or ""The Killing."" I especially liked the actress playing the female cop Hinrika. I loved her facial expressions and understated acting.",1502928000,,526,5.057471264367816

In about a minute or two you don't even realize they're speaking Icelandic, you are so enthralled with the location and the people that reading the subtitles happens almost unconsciously. I could have spent another 10 hours with these characters exploring all of the facets of this foreign town. Wow, why don't we have show this good in the states?",1502841600,,414,4.608108108108108

Producers can always find excellent actors, directors, cinematographers, set designers, musical score writers, etc., but good script writers/story tellers are increasingly hard to find. This movie keeps the narrative/story moving with lots of twists and turns, and a minimum of ""soap opera filler."" Then it builds to some surprises near/at the end, like any good mystery/thriller should. Amazing how the writers keep you interested for the entire 400 minutes. And casting the unconventional, big burly, bearded fellow, who usually plays villains, as the hero, is a nice touch. This movie is on the same level as the excellent ""Bosch"" and ""Goliath"" movies from Amazon. I look forward to Season 2.",1502841600,,773,5.45

TRAPPED is an excellent venue for thinkers, puzzle-solving detective wannabes; this slow-paced suspenseful Nordic story unfolds to reveal several surprises toward the end of the season.  I've liked actor lafur Darri lafsson, starring as Police Chief in Trapped, since I saw him in his short but memorable part in Liam Neeson's Among the Tombstones.

Even the excellent music lends its expert mood-setting to this Icelandic drama that I could not stop watching. I watched every episode and long for more so I dearly hope there will be a Season 2.

Other than that, I wish it was dubbed. I like to watch movies on one screen and web browse on the other. Having to read the cc made it hard. All in all a good if not great series. I just wonder how that lady was still able to make a deal for the port. I would think she would be implicated by the others on the insurance scam.

The only complaint I had was how bleeping cold I was watching the series.  I live in Arizona and kept asking my husband, ""how can people live there??"".  He reminded me that we live in Arizona.  Also why would anyone in that town need a commercial freezer??  Just throw the dang stuff outside!  I do hope you can acquire more of this production companys product.

The characters are well developed, the Icelandic ethos and environment are well represented, the plot develops at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow, the suspense level is fairly even--it may fall for a little while but not long enough for the viewer to lose interest.  In fact, there are so many ongoing threads, so many different stories, so many complex relationships among the characters that these subplots in themselves add to the suspense.

7657798,4,B01BKI6IF6,"Just finished this series. I wasn't quite sure about it the first couple of episodes, but after that the characters and story grew on me. This is a somewhat dark crime drama, as there is much tension and no comic relief. Favorite character is the lady cop. I normally shy away from foreign films because the subtitles are distracting to me, but this series looked so interesting I had to give it a try (glad I did). No comparison to Fortitude. That would be like saying every NYC-based cop show is the same (and God knows there's been plenty of them). Gorgeous scenery, and made me want to visit Iceland if I weren't afraid of flying. You will read plenty of swearing, and some nudity initially. Would definitely watch a Season 2.",1502236800,,730,4.537878787878788

So unless you are proficient in whatever Nordic language they are speaking you will never be able to follow what is going on.

7657832,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Everything about this series captured my interest. And I binge watched over a couple of days. Rather than Hollywood studs and beauties, it was cast with everyday people. How refreshing and even enlightening because the big, burly, hirsute main character was just as attractive as any A-list film star I've seen. As I am prone to do, I felt I got to know the characters intimately and hated to see the credits roll in Episode 10. It's like saying goodby to friends. (I know--get a life!!) The acting was excellent. The story line definitely kept my interest and, and as in most modern thrillers, there was no way to predict who killed whom. One of the best features of the series was getting to see a little of Icelandic life and landscapes. I cannot imagine why people choose to stay in such cold climes, but I am glad they do because there would be no ""Trapped"" without them. I don't know if ""Season 1"" means there is a Season 2, but I really hope so.",1501718400,10,952,4.445714285714286

I was not bothered at all by the subtitles and some of the dialogue is in English. I found the series all consuming and, at the same time, very calming compared to our American fare of lightning quick editing, too loud film scores and dumbed up screenplays for the 18 to 40 year old demographic. This was a true pleasure to watch and enjoy. It would be nice to be able to stream more cinema from Iceland!

The weather was a major character and essential to the overall sadness and brilliance of the whole piece. The best ten hours I've spent in a long time. Not one special effect. Wow! The great message is that life is so easily disrupted by random acts of greed and can be so redeemed by random acts of goodness. I'd like to write more, but don't want to give away any of the plot.

7657850,5,B01BKI6IF6,"I first watched ""Trapped"" over a year ago on DVD (purchased from Amazon UK) and thought it was ""good"". Thrilled it came to Prime, I watched it again and found it WAY better on second viewing! If you love ""Nordic Noir"", (which are great crime shows from Sweden, Denmark like Beck, The Bridge etc,) you will love this show, the first ""exported"" series from Iceland. The story is a multilayered tale starting with the discovery of a headless torso by the 3 person local Police force at the port where a ferry from Denmark has arrived. Family secrets, divorce, avalanches, this story has a lot going on. It moves slowly & thoughtfully the way Nordic crime stories do but delivers great drama and intensity along the way. I love the character development in this kind of show and the taking of time to deliver the story only makes the ending that much richer. Now that you can watch it for free on Prime--I highly recommend you watch it.",1501459200,16,932,4.553571428571429

7657855,4,B01BKI6IF6,"Iceland, what do you think of when you hear that word, cold, ice, snow, people with blue eyes, and you would be correct. Here we are in the town of Seyisfj&ouml;rur, in the middle of winter. It is 80 degrees out as I watched this series, but I felt chilly. 'Trapped' is a big series, 10 episodes packed full of crime, violence, people and a heck of a story.

A ferry carrying hundreds of passengers from Denmark sails into this town. However, just before it reaches land a headless, armless, legless torso is pulled up from the sea. And, here we begin. The local police chief, Andri Olafssun, calls the mainland Reykjavik to alert them of the crime, and he is told to stop the ferry from leaving. Now, as we learn throughout this series, Andre is a much better detective and policeman than the jerk who comes from the big city. Andri and his two colleagues pretty much figure everything out as the ten episodes occur.

This is a gut wrenching, exciting series. Many people involved, and we learn about their lives. Andri is separated from his wife Agnes, who returns with someone in tow, and his life becomes a mess. However, Andri is a big guy who can handle a lot, and by gosh he does. One clue after another is unearthed, an avalanche shakes the town, the big guys come from the city, and make one hellva mess. Andri picks everything up, and one by one the crimes, yes it is crimes by this time, are solved. I loved Andri, he knows his work and his job. He is ethical, honest and nothing stops him.

This is a series to watch, emotions run the rampant, and you will become invested in the characters. Hooray for Andri!

7657857,5,B01BKI6IF6,"For the viewer who likes Scadinavian procedural mysteries.  The first episode engages the grizzly and a bit of nudity, if these offend, in the first 5 minutes, but leaves off for all the rest of the series and moves on to be compelling to watch.  It is about the effects of corruption and greed that have seeped into a small community at the end of a fjord in Iceland and the influence of international vice.  Their scaled down police force deals during a blizzard that cuts them off from the rest of Iceland.  I binge watched this and my only complaint is that the police chief often sails out into what can only be freezing cold snow storms without a hat or doing up his jacket.  For those who watched Fortitude, Trapped is certainly less in the surreal bizzare department and gives a sense of an authentic small Icelandic community.  This was good and I hope for the continuation of the series.",1501372800,2,897,4.506172839506172

One example of an incredibly trite plot device that keeps for some reason getting rehashed: city leaders sitting around a table marveling at the model of a new development plan when someone walks in and announces there's been a murder, which throws an obvious wrench into those development plans. Kidding me? The story is tired and worn out enough as it is, but the fact that it is EXACTLY THE SAME AS FORTITUDE makes it a joke.",1501372800,10,525,4.78021978021978

I've watched a lot of the Danish and British shows (Wallander, Dicte, Shetland, etc.) in the same vein as this one and just like those, this was very well done. There are several crimes going on throughout this season and it might seem like a lot to keep up with, but stick with it. There were a couple of small points where it dragged just a little, but pay attention so that you don't miss any little detail since it will all add up. Very good acting and display of real humanity by all of the actors.

7657875,5,B01BKI6IF6,"A well written series with some surprising twists. The acting was very good, especially Olafsson who portrays the gentle giant police chief. The main characters were well developed. The general feeling of sadness and things lost is strong in this series, but does not overwhelm it to the point where all you see is despair (eg. I love Wallander, but it can be a real downer sometimes). There were obvious moments of happiness during family dinners and every day life in a small town. There were also a few oh bleep moments during what amounted to a two week nightmare of violent crime in a town where a DUI is all that usually fills the roster. The ending was bittersweet. Some characters lose everything, while others have a chance at a new beginning. This series is a must watch.",1501113600,13,781,4.625899280575539
7657876,5,B01BKI6IF6,"Amazing show.  I almost dropped out halfway through the season, but so glad I didn't.  The story unfolds slowly, and at times it seemed like just a bunch of unrelated events---the true scope and proportion of the drama only appeared (at least to me) very gradually-- like the outline of a mountain emerging as a melting glacier drops away piece by piece.  I would say it is very much a personal drama along the lines of Greek tragedy, the nature of the main characters dictates the events, it feels inevitable toward the end.  The police/mystery element keeps things moving along, but the real story is underneath.  Uncommon depth and subtlety.",1501113600,3,644,4.818181818181818

One point of note though-- this show is hauntingly similar in style, story and acting as Fortitude.  In fact, some of the characters and their personal situations are very similar--- ""Bjrn Hlynur Haraldsson"" who plays ""Trausti"" the lead detective in Reykjavik, also plays a local police officer in Fortitude.  In Fortitude, the governor was pushing the creation of a major economic development called the Ice Hotel and Resort, and in Trapped the major and local businesses are pushing a major economic development that will create a modern shipping port.

It is a unique crime drama not only because it is an Icelandic crime drama with a beautiful (and cold) location but because the crime story that Trapped tells has not been told before, which makes watching it a first-time experience. If you are a Region 1 viewer (United States) this DVD will not play on it - I suggest investing in a multi-region DVD player if you buy a lot of foreign films and shows, because this show is definitely worth the expense. The characters are multi-faceted and they face unique challenges throughout the television show, which are exacerbated due to a cruise incoming to their city, death/s, unhappy people, and the environment; the environment and the cold weather is a character itself.

This series is very much a documentary of Icelanders and their country and one must appreciate the amount of darkness as in the winter there is mostly darkness and the kind of weather depicted.
