8048761,5,B0007M3ZLW,"Running Wild ..it says 1973 but it was filmed in 1968. Can't believe I found a copy of this movie ..mine was removed from my home a long time ago ...the reason I have this movie is my Little sister was the stunt rider for Dina Merrill ..she is actually the one who is being drug by the horse in the move and she appears in several other scenes at the party as an extra ..and her famous hair flick can be seen when she is standing next to the guy in the blue suit with a big fat cigar ..if ya blink ya might miss it ...lol and she still has that same hair flick today ...lol Love ya
Lil Sis ..I'm digitizing this movie for a keep sake and putting it in a safe place this time ..it's not the best movie but I love my Lil Sis !",1466380800,,724,3.801324503311258
8048762,4,B0007M3ZLW,"Glad I was able to find this old movie.  It is a good representation of some of the issues and management ideas the wild horses have faced.  Worked well to show ""Wild Horse Annie"" in my classroom.",1318809600,,196,4.27027027027027
8048763,3,B0007M3ZLW,"The movie was just OK. It wasn't the movie I was searching for, but it was still ok for the horse lover in me. I don't think I would recommend it to a friend though because it just didn't wow me like some movies have.",1308268800,,217,3.8444444444444446
