2669998,5,B000JCE3MA,Streisand's finale reduced me to tears and Kristopherson was so hot back then with his blue eyes. I have enjoyed seeing this many times. Knowing that Clint Eastwood in 2018 might have remade this as a director is intriguing and it could have happened awhile back but now there will be a bunch of unknowns remaking this movie.  What a disappointment. So I will treasure my copy and view it often and have intention of seeing this new one.,1520899200,,437,4.531645569620253

2670002,4,B000JCE3MA,"This movie made quite a splash in the 70s - mostly terrible reviews, but a smash hit soundtrack and Barbra and Kris' chemistry made this a very popular movie.  Even then, it was over the top in many ways, but the timeless story, now being made a fourth time with Lady GaGa and Bradley Cooper, endures, and there are more than a few gems on the soundtrack.  Barbra is at the zenith of her performing power, her voice rich and confident and her live performances throughout the movie remain classics.  But it is Kristofferson who steals your heart.  He is touchingly vulnerable, especially pitted against Babs' undeniable power, and earns your tears.  A note: this movie deserves a top-notch Blu-Ray version, for the music alone.",1509667200,,727,4.784
