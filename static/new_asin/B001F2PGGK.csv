8300648,5,B001F2PGGK,Read maybe a million reviews that said they were introduced to yoga through P90X and can't stand the pony tailed instructors--I found the same.  Here is your answer if you wand p90x  Yoga in under 1/2 hour,1391040000,,205,4.513513513513513
8300649,5,B001F2PGGK,"I really enjoy the two yoga DVDs from Tony Horton's One on One series, Patience Hummingbird and Fountain of Youth; both are excellent. I picked this one up for some more variety and to give it a try. It is a little dated - it came out in 2004, before P90X. It is a good workout, but not wholly yoga. There is a little kempo, and a little cardio. It is 35 minutes, and I am planning on working it in regularly as an extra workout. Tony mentions in the video that it can be good to start the day if you are really stiff, or to end the day. As I said, the video is a little dated, but working out with Tony on a beach in Hawaii, with the sounds of the waves and the surf, helps enhance the workout. I do personally prefer the One on One yoga workouts but as Tony often states: 'different is good', and this adds one more yoga workout to my catalog.",1323043200,,845,3.976470588235294
