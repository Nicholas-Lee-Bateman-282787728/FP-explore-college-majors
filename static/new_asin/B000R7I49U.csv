8440489,5,B000R7I49U,"Although I stopped following hip hop by the turn of the millenium, it hasn't been forgotten by me and I enjoy hearing it now and then ... and one of my favorites from back in the day was E 40 and the whole bay area sound.

This set of videos features E 40 with a whole host of other rappers, providing us with a good variety of quality lyrical skills ( Too Short is on three of them :-) and beats.

The quality of the (stereo only) audio is very good as is the video.

Definately one of my favorite rap dvds with which to chilla, and well worth the scrilla. Peace.",1312502400,,564,4.017857142857143
