1337301,5,B00003XALS,"Other documentaries do not come close to explaining what Hitler and his National Socialism were about.  They are merely rehashes of what happened and how terrible it was.  Architecture of Doom actually ventures, with research to support it, to account for the thinking behind Hitler's movement.

The Germans were not the only people looking for a Fhrer after World War I.  The revolutions which The Great War gave rise to in Eastern, Central and Southern Europe virtually all ended in chaos, which only strong organizations with strong leaders could control:  Lenin, Mussolini, Franco, Atatrk, various Balkan strongmen and, yes, Roosevelt.  These leaders entered political vacuums and put their own stamp on their nations.  Fortunately for America, Roosevelt's stamp was consistent with humane values.  For the rest, alas....

The man who rose in the political vacuum of Germany was, in the view of The Architecture of Doom, first and foremost, an artist.  His vision of what Germany should be was purely sthetic.  Because Hitler's will was imposed absolutely through terror, administered by his fanatical acolyte Heinrich Himmler, Hitler was able, uniquely in history (unless one counts Nero) actually  to render his nation as a work of art.  To remove the ""ugliness,"" Hitler and Himmler employed mass murder.

But this is not the most unsettling thesis of The Architecture of Doom.  Not only was Hitler a painter (A wistful dream: If only the Vienna Academy had accepted Hitler's application...), he was a theatrical producer, director and actor.  Viewing Wagner's opera ""Rienzi"" was, by Hitler's own account, a watershed in his life.  Cola di Rienzi was a medieval Italian politician who took over Rome, tried to unify Italy and restore the classical Roman Republic.  Through a combination of treachery and the ingratitude of the people, Rienzi failed in his quest and perished in a violent siege.

The Architecture of Doom suggests, to me persuasively, that the World War II was actually conceived as a play, produced, directed and starring Adolf Hitler.  It's a fantastic, nightmarish thought, but it makes sense after watching The Architecture of Doom.",1206144000,2,2158,5.236151603498542
1337302,5,B00003XALS,"Several key points underpin Hitler's ""mission"" for the German people in this documentary directed by Peter Cohen: the need to make Germany racially clean, the need to make the ethnically Aryan people realise that they were always meant to be the dominant race in the world, and the need to make the German state the greatest in the world. Hitler's campaign in this respect was, so the film alleges, essentially civilian, but under a military guise.

The two-hour film opens with an aerial view of what is purported to be a German village, yet the background story concerns questions about what Hitler's racial theories and policies actually meant in practice. The Holocaust, in which six million Jews were exterminated during World War II, was merely the latest episode in a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"", which had actually started back in the 1930s after Hitler had come to power. The focus was initially on the mentally ill and the deformed, but it later widened to include the Jews as ""the microbe"" which was allegedly responsible for ""infecting"" Europe, not just with their genes, but with their own ideas about art.

Propaganda films, which feature heavily in this film, essentially proselytize the German people into believing that the mentally ill, the retarded and the Jews were infestations that had to be eradicated. To this end, hideous methods were devised to ""euthanise"" the targets, whose families were lied to about the true nature of their deaths.

The death camps were the ultimate expression of Hitler's eugenics programme, yet the term could well be applied to the artistic depiction of the ""perfect"" Aryan, particularly through sculpture at the hands of people like Arno Breker. Through art exhibitions held every year, he wanted the German people to see what direction they should be taking, as he believed that art, his own former profession at which he ultimately failed, was one of the most significant props to his political regime. In order to emphasize the gulf between ""pure"" German art and those of ""undesirables"", he deliberately had works by the mentally ill displayed in so-called ""Degenerate Art"" exhibitions, albeit in separate locations.

As stated in the title, the term, ""architecture"", is prominent, though it appears that it is not as prominent in the purest sense of the word. His unbelievably ambitious plans for Berlin and the Austrian city of Linz are highlighted, including the relative absurdity of his receiving the final plans for a regenerated Linz, which would have included a gigantic museum of the arts, just three months before the end of the war in Europe. In this movie, we see Hitler's fleeting visit to Paris (then just conquered) very early on a June morning in 1940, where his mission was to look at the city's art treasures, including the Opera. It is even claimed that Hitler was so familiar with the plans of the building that he even noticed that an ante-chamber was actually missing; apparently, it had been eliminated during a renovation programme. The German conquest of Greece in June 1941 is also shown; Hitler envisioned a state that would be a hybrid of ancient Greece, ancient Rome and Sparta. Indeed, he considered Sparta to be the most ethnically pure state in ancient history.

The attack on the USSR later in June 1941 and the onset of the coming Russian winter in November allegedly turned the tide of the war against Germany, and even this received artistic expression when pictures drawn from the front highlighted the hardships of the German army fighting in the USSR. The overall war situations are given scant coverage, given the subject matter of the film, yet they are nevertheless put into their proper context. Hitler knew that defeat was inevitable, yet he actually looked forward to Germany's fiery defeat, reminiscent of what had happened to Carthage during the Punic Wars. The film claims that Hitler's war strategy may have been blighted by his apparent obsession with antiquity: he was allegedly fighting a modern war with ancient war objectives, which included enslavement of conquered peoples. Even if Germany was going to be destroyed militarily, he still ordered the continuation of the ""Final Solution"" as he believed that a defeated Germany would therefore be left with only with the weak, since the good would have died fighting for the Reich.

Anti-Semitism was, so Hitler claimed, justified on the grounds that he saw Jews as constituting an ethnic power bloc against the Aryan race. He therefore viewed his campaign to cleanse Europe of non-Aryans as a primary reason for conducting the war, and he used films, such as ""The Eternal Jew"" (shot in the squalor of Polish ghettos in 1940), in his propaganda campaign. He likened the destruction of the Jews to the destruction of rats and other pests; indeed, a pest control film (made in 1938) is shown as part of the propaganda where gas is used to kill pests; that same gas (""Zyklon-B"") would be used in the death camps.

Overall, since it is a documentary, the film exists to inform rather than to entertain, but it does delve deep into Hitler's psyche in order to portray a failed artist (who made architectural sketches of planned buildings well into the war) obsessed with the ""mission"" to make Germany a mighty state primarily through racial purity and artistic expression - and, ultimately, violence of the vilest kind imaginable.",1121126400,40,5386,4.991091314031181
1337303,5,B00003XALS,"This is a superb documentary.  Bold and controversial thesis.  Evidence marshalled effectively.  Great use of archival footage.  Generally gripping and with very good pacing (occasionally there is a digression which, while important to the general line of argument, is not introduced in a way that makes the relevance immediately clear).  Plus, don't you really want to know what projects seemed closest to Hitler's heart when the war was getting bogged down on the Eastern Front?  Hint: They weren't military ones.

Cohen argues that the Nazi project was that of producing a better and more beautiful human being and race, a project that integrated art and the science of the day.  The Nazi aesthetic was not just propaganda to get people to become committed Nazis, but was a goal in and of itself, from the earlier optimism of producing a better humanity (or at least Aryan race) to Hitler's eventual--but not unmotivated by earlier commitments--desire for an ending befiting classical tragedy.

The beginning is marvellously done.  The portrayal of Nazism is so sympathetic that one is drawn in, and may even wonder if the film maker does not have Nazi sympathies.  Any such wonder disappears within twenty minutes, but the film maker's ability to see what was so attractive about the Nazi project is crucial to the success of the film.  In the end, one realizes that the Nazi project was evil in a way simultaneously subtler and yet deeper than one may have thought at the outset.

The film maker never draws parallels with our time.  Still, the film should make one reflect on how the desires for perfect human beings and for the elimination of the imperfect are manifested now.",1107820800,51,1683,4.943060498220641
1337304,1,B00003XALS,I am a student of third reich history and when I heard of the release of this film I managed to see it at an independent theatre.  While there is a great deal of interesting documentary footage and fair analysis this has got to be about the dullest documentary I have ever seen.  There is no style to the directing or editing.  The narration is even worse.  The good points are negated by the overall stale production.  This is certainly not a film to even rent let alone purchase.

1337305,4,B00003XALS,"Google lists nearly 200 films about Adolf Hitler, most of them documentaries such as Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Fuhrer: Rise of a Madman.
The Architecture of Doom was perhaps the first to propose the notion that Hitler embraced the art of politics after failing as a painter, suggesting that Nazism was a reflection of the dictator's perverse aesthetic tastes. In its deconstruction of the Nazi movement, the movie is novel and shows an interesting, perhaps true, perspective.
But what minor grouse I have is with the narrative, which is just shy of 2 hours or so and sports a frequent monotone of showing Nazi art. Yet, thankfully, it doesn't detract substantially from the intriguing perspective that Hitler's whole pet project was perhaps more of a dogged pursuit of an aesthetic.
This documentary is definitely worth a watch if you are interested in the Third Reich in any way.",1058400000,30,897,4.947019867549669

But the footage  is very rare and the video gets very in-depth with regard to Hitler's  obsession with art and his plan to create a new art culture for Germany. I  didn't know he was this enthralled with architecting a new society to the  point of deciding which art was good for the country and which was bad and  what art should be destroyed.

1337310,4,B00003XALS,"At 120 minutes, Architecture of Doom should not deter a sensible, thoughtful viewer from shunning an exhaustively lengthy documentary, with such an imposing title. This item is a valuable visual history collectible  and frame for frame is worth its price in DVD ($20.95).  My copy, though,  is VHS, acquired two years ago, hence if I strongly recommend it to other  viewers with ample store of attention span, then this fresh DVD copy  delivers a more impactful presentation, much much better than stone age  VHS.  The film ended with the unprecedented conclusion that the Nazi war  cannot be defined alone by the normal raison d' etre of warfare:  territorial expansion, exploitation of neighbours' resources, or simply to  settle old or new scores. Hitler and his war was also unleashed to mould -  terrifyingly,literally - a society who will define his ideal of perfection  and superiority. The Jews, the Russians and native German themselves who  were misfortuned to be incapacitated by mental and physical retardation and  defects, have to be eliminated because they were infections and parasites  against what should be a hygienically and genetically superior German  ""Volk body."" The war has simply justified an excuse to eliminate  them, to such an obliterative brutality.  Architecture features two  valuable propaganda films that were not issued before as a full length film  like ""Triumph of the Will"" is today. These are ""The  Wandering Jew"" and another which likened Jews to the anopheles  mosquito. The former equated  European Jewry with rat infestations, the  latter emphatically advocated the extermination of Jews as should be done  with the pestering mosquito. For these alone, the viewer will be given a  ""time-transporting"" avenue to ""feel"" how the Nazis  fiendishly indoctrinated their willing executioners to begin hating the  Jews through the cinematic medium.  Valuable also are color footages of  Nuremberg rallies and obscure monochrome footages of Hitler planning and  mulling over his grandiose monuments which he plans to build when the war  is over and  complete victory is achieved, in what would consists for a new  Berlin, more splendid, and bigger and mightier than Paris or classical  Athens  and Rome. These monuments on blueprints and lifesize dioramas,  visualized by Albert Spheer,one of which was ""cinematographically  realized"" in the film ""Motherland"" (about Hitler victorious  and presiding over a European empire called Germania), are what the film's  title refers to.  A sizable portion of Architecture expounded on the  artistic backgrounds of the leading Nazi hierarchy, beginning of course  with Hitler. According to Nazi historian Trevor Roper, Hitler's rejection  by a Vienna Fine Arts School unfortunately planted the germseed of  bitterness on young Hitler. When he assumed absolute leadership of Germany,  it can almost be put as poetic justice that he strengthened and  ""carved"" anew his country according to his aesthetic ideals.  Presumably, it must have made his bygone rejectors in Austria's E'cole de  Arts wet their pants. During Hitler's rule, degenerate artworks, like the  works of Picasso, were ridiculed and effectively banned. Architecture  presented the fine details how Hitler meticulously revised the definition  of what is art, during that period in European history. While waging war in  two fronts, Hitler's native artistry compulsed him to also attend to the  selection of what should be exhibited in German art museums. If there's  something that could be commended about this German monster, it is his  decent and conservative standard for art that truly glorifies beauty rather  than ""modernistic"" art that only brings ugliness. Architecture  presented an array of ""degenerate"" paintings and sculptures some  of which were by people like Picasso. If the viewer would be very objective  and discerning about it, chances are that he'll be provoke to ask himself  if the Nazis were, at least, have gotten it ""right"" in a single  instance, with their choice for good and bad art. On my experience, what  was condemned by the Nazis, as Architecture has impressively showcased,  were not much different than what I find today as modern art. They glorify  ugliness and obscure and alters the human figure as if the artist was  hallucinating. The only diff'rence is that the Nazis unjustifiably  attributed their degenerate art as the work of Jews and dissenters who  wants to bring the standards down, and in so doing ""infect"" the  sanitized German body organism. Architecture brings you sights of  retardates and insanes whom the Nazis condemned as unfit to co-exist with  healthier folks, thus, before the concentration camps were on full horrible  operation, the crematuriums for mental condemnees were already churning out  copious smokes. Tear-inducing footages of Jews now being rounded up for  firing squad executions gives you a glimpse of the last seconds of lives  that are to be extinguished without any dignity or reason. To sanitized the  Final Solution, the Nazis engaged instead the authoritative hands of  professional doctors to switch on the exhaust pipes of the gas chambers,  instead of the pedestrian butchers. After watching Architecture, you'll  learn a new term: Cyclone B.  Watching this work affords the viewer a  glimpse of  both the (potential) glory and what were so reprehensible about  Hitler and his movement. ""Murder took on the guise of a hygienic  measure."" After this film, buy also for your video reference  library  ""The Last Days"" by Steven Spielberg's Shoah Foundation. I'm proud  to say that the purchase of these films, as well as ten others on Nazi  visual history, has made me poorer of several thousand pesos, yet I still  have to GO through the misery of watching any films of John Travolta or  Bruce Willis, on their entirety. There's just no comparison....",953596800,32,5874,5.281216069489685

7919653,4,B00003XALS,"This show which was made back hin the 1980's in Germany was a important show because it was a really good attempt at dealing with the past. Today we get alot better shows about that period from germany. (with soldiers admitting killing lots of people and kids even). But back then many of the exnazis were still around! This one was made to document how the nazis worldview included architecture and how various buildings were used. Of course we get the story of hitlers bizaare plans for a new berlin and for the reich museum at linz. Austria was as much nazi as germany was after all. So we see the Germans coming to grips with the nightmare in this vintage show and we have yet to see Japan and Austria do the same. this show is not boring but it's about architure alot.

7919655,5,B00003XALS,An excellent demonstration of the distracted workings of Hitler's mind and how history has proved that this ordinary artist and frustrated architect rose to the very top of authority in Germany in the 1930s.  It is a display of the incredible attraction this man offered the German people as he attempted to lead his nation away from the embarrasment of losing the Great War.  Yet little could indicate the extremes to which he would direct Germany in his attempt to gain world domination.,1331424000,,489,4.879518072289157
7919656,2,B00003XALS,"My interest in documentaries about the 3d Reich lies in trying to fathom how the German people, reputedly very intelligent, became seduced by a psychotic Austrian dwarf who painted muddy watercolor postcards. This documentary sheds no light on that question. While the footage is rare, the long black pauses between visuals become annoying. Hitler was terrified by the idea that he might be the bastard of an undeclared Jewish father, so much so that he paid off his nephew in London, who threatened to expose him. His niece, Angelika ('Geli') lived with Herr Hitler for awhile and was forced to have ""sex"" with him, which (get this) consisted of peeing on him while he crouched and reached orgasm. She committed suicide soon after. The DVD does nothing to integrate the architecture with the agenda. It briefly goes into the invasion of Russia, euthanasia of the mentally challenged and deformed, and the ""final solution"" of the Jews. After World War I, the defeat of Germany caused humiliation, while the punitive reparations of the Treaty of Versailles caused hyperinflation (the government purposely overprinted currency so that the victors couldn't accurately assess the true value of the Deutsch mark) and mass hardship. So they were ripe for a ""Savior"" or leader (""Fhrer""). Most Germans were farmers or tradesmen, without much education. They gave Hitler total authority, and let him bring down Germany with his delusional visions of absolute power. But back to the DVD, you can do much better elsewhere.",1314662400,,1511,5.1214574898785425
7919657,4,B00003XALS,"This is one of the most insightful documentaries about the psychology of the Third Reich as envisioned by Hitler. It takes the viewer step-by-step through Hitler's thought processes as evidenced by his actions prior to coming to power and after being elected leader.  What becomes clear through the course of the documentary is how certain early influences had a profound impact on Hitler's policies. One of these influences is that of composer Richard Wagner whom Hitler saw as a role model - a synthesis of artist and politician.  Wagner's anti-Semitism, belief in the cult of a Nordic legacy and the myth of pure blood would in turn contribute to Hitler's own worldview.

We get to see how the Nazis were absolutely obsessed with the idea of `cleansing' - beginning with the `cleansing' of art. Hitler was taken with art works that depicted Aryan power and superiority, and considered avant garde art as a mark of spiritual and intellectual depravity. These artworks, and especially those by Jewish artists were banned in Nazi Germany, and the Jew was portrayed as the perpetrator of ""cultural Bolshevism"".  Not too long after these artworks were banned, the Nazis went further - where art was promoted as an expression of the German peoples' desire for racial fulfillment.  Lectures and tours were conducted by prominent Nazis to show the link between physical degeneration and artistic perversion - photos of mentally ill and severely handicapped people were shown alongside distorted artworks to drive this point home. Propaganda films were also used by the Nazis to portray the mentally ill and severely handicapped as unproductive and a drain on resources.

It was interesting to see how the Nazification of physicians was undertaken - initially by the expulsion of Jewish doctors in Germany, and later the setting up of Nazi schools of medicine rooted in eugenics. I was quite startled to learn that 45% of German physicians at the time were members of the Nazi party. I guess this made it a lot easier for Hitler to ensure the smooth running of the T4 program where the systematic murder of the mentally ill and handicapped were carried out.

Propaganda films such as ""The Eternal Jew"" were also used on a massive scale to convince and persuade the Aryan Germans of the need to eradicate the Jews from all aspects of everyday life - comparing Jews to vermin and carriers of disease, and portraying them as avaricious and untrustworthy. Besides the T4 program, the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws saw the Nazis' resolve to carry out their purification program with the main targets being Jews. The Final Solution which sealed the fate of European Jewry and resulted in the genocide of the Jewish people in Europe was basically an extension of these earlier attempts at purification/cleansing of the German race - the mass shootings were inefficient and messy, the death vans were inconvenient, and so the Nazis come up with the idea of building death camps to gas the victims on a massive scale never before seen in human history.

The documentary lags in certain places, and frankly I found the narration (in German) to be rather monotonous, but these flaws are more than made up for by the excellent use of archival footage featuring the massive Nazi rallies, the various exhibitions carried out by Hitler and the Nazis, the pictures of Hitler's actual artwork, and especially the footage of Nazi policies in action as well as footage of battle and the ultimate fall of the Third Reich. At almost two hours long, this is a well-made and insightful documentary about the influences that impacted Hitler's worldview and drove his determination to create a powerful Germany, a quest motivated by an obsessive desire for racial purification which ultimately led to the extermination of the mentally ill & handicapped, the implementation of the Final Solution which resulted in the Holocaust, and finally the fall of the Third Reich.",1263513600,,3944,5.001524390243903
