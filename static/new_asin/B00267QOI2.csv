3853121,5,B00267QOI2,My daughter loves!  This even little one will enjoy since not much voice over was done.  Very well made!  Hope they will have more vol.,1363824000,,135,4.32
3853122,5,B00267QOI2,"I found this in a $5 bin and I'll admit I was a little apprehensive about whether or not the fact that it was in English was going to ruin it. I've watched some episodes on YouTube and even though I couldn't understand a word they were saying, that didn't stop it from being funny. I figured for $5, I didn't have much to lose.

I'm glad I made the purchase. Although the episodes are short, they're completely worth the money. While watching the episode titled 'Headphones', my husband and I laughed so hard we almost cried. I haven't finished the disc yet, but it's already proved it's worth in laughs.

This is a must have for any Domo lover! <3",1357689600,,648,4.347107438016529

3853124,5,B00267QOI2,Soooo cute. It is impossible not to smile while watching this dvd. Adorable stop-motion animation with totally lovable characters. It's probably worth noting that some of the episodes are very short. Loads of fun - our family gives it four thumbs up.,1327190400,,250,4.976190476190476
3853125,4,B00267QOI2,"Ever heard of Domo? He's an adorable little creature with fuzzy brown fur and a giant toothy mouth that never closes.

And this strange little Japanese mascot has become so popular (both in Japan and the US) that he even got his own TV show -- a series of stop-motion shorts chronicling his adventures with his woodland friends. These stories are a little strange at times (Americans may not know what a shapeshifting tanuki is), but they have an innocently odd charm that never ceases.

In these stories, Domo roams around photographing the world, tries to climb the highest tree, chases a smiling balloon that has escaped him, uses headphones to hear the ""music"" of the world, plays with a bunch of melodious mushrooms, chases a robot dog, gets chased by a hungry bear, and plays in a rock band that is struck by lightning.

Some of his adventures involve his friends as well -- he goes ice-skating and pursues a giant fish, encounters a shapeshifting tanuki that pretends to be him, tries to understand sibling dynamics, plays at ""going to work,"" and attempts to have a secret hide-out... until people find out about it.

Each of the ""Domo"" episodes is only about a minute and a half long, but the animators manage to make each a self-contained story. This is partly because the stories are so simple -- usually it involves Domo stumbling across something strange and new to him, or trying to accomplish something despite the odds. There's not a lot of dialogue (Domo only says ""DO-MO!""), and a few don't really have dialogue at all.

Perhaps this simplicity is what makes the Domo shorts as charming as they are. Domo acts like a little kid, dancing to musical mushrooms, ice-skating after fish, pretending to make business calls, and photographing all sorts of things (including ghosts). The only problem is that a few things about it might not immediately make sense to Americans -- one episode is about a shapeshifting tanuki, but it never appears as itself.

Domo himself is an adorable character, sort of like a little kid --  curious, eager, and sometimes oblivious to how other people feel. The other characters are ""normal"" counterparts to Domo (an elderly rabbit, a flighty weasel and a family of stoned foxes) but none of them have the charm and weirdness of the titular character. Oh, and there are kissing snakes and a pair of talking bats.

""Domo"" is very brief, but it's also quite charming, cute, and strangely childlike. And it has Domo. What more could you possibly ask for?",1325980800,,2495,4.77262180974478
3853126,5,B00267QOI2,"We acquired this DVD at the Japanese department store in Epcot at DisneyWorld in Orlando. It was $15.99, and is worth every penny - not only will you find many hilarious episodes of Domo and his friends cavorting in their usual style, but included with the bonus content there are the winning submissions from the Domo Animation Contest - people from all over Japan created their OWN Domo adventures - and many of those are as funny, if not funnier, than some of Domo's professionally written and scripted jaunts.  In short, if you are a fan of this sort of thing, you will be hard-pressed not to enjoy every minute of this DVD. My son and I watched it all the way through -- twice -- and still plan to watch it again soon.  Order it while it is still available, and ensure yourself many enjoyable evenings of laughs!",1308182400,,817,4.476510067114094
3853127,5,B00267QOI2,Got info back from you thank you and if you can either send me another DVD or refund that would be great thanks,1299801600,,111,3.869565217391304
3853128,5,B00267QOI2,"Domo is a sweet all ages type stop action animation. These very short vignettes are sometimes bewildering but always beautifully done. I guess you just have to throw yourself into it. It's Domo's world, we're just passengers.

My family watched this DVD all Christmas and somehow Domo's simple cheerfulness was perfect for the occasion. The animation is gorgeous. Domo eating rice is worth the price alone.

I'm off to fill my house with Domo related items.....",1261785600,7,461,5.052631578947368
3853129,4,B00267QOI2,"As far as value goes, this DVD does not have a lot of content for the price.  The English dubbed main video shorts comprise, even when watching each opening and closing (which play before and after each short), only about a half an hour long.  The extras push the time closer to the hour mark (though the original NHK shorts that are included have their dubbed audio removed and contain no subtitles), but for the price of the DVD (set at 14.99 MSRP), I would expect a bit more.  The domo-textured slip-cover that the DVD comes in is nice, but it doesn't exactly add value to the release.

That aside, Domo, even for casual fans, is fantastically entertaining.  I brought this DVD to work to watch during lunch and it was a hit with everyone.  Even the people who shook their heads in disbelief still laughed and smiled at the simple and seemingly non sequitur humor.

The stories are clearly designed to appeal to young children, but there is still entertainment value there for everyone, even those in their teens and twenties (or even older).  You can watch this DVD with your kids, with your parents, with your friends, with your coworkers; anyone.  It's light and comical and just as funny on a second or third viewing as on the first.  Each short runs under five minutes, making them easy to watch in short bursts of one or to at a time or plow through all at once.

The stop-motion animation quality is top-notch.  This wasn't thrown together to make a quick buck.  The Japanese studio that created the original NHK television station spots (where Domo came from) also created the shorts on this DVD.

The opening song, seemingly written for the English language release, is catchy.  It's too short to get annoying, even after hearing it a dozen times throughout the DVD, and is easy to learn, as it contains only one word: ""domo.""

In all, this DVD is worth buying for any hardcore Domo fan.  For the casual fan, you might want to find it at a discount, buy it used, or rent it, as the sticker price is a little high for so little content.  The front of the DVD claims that this is ""volume 1,"" so we can expect more, probably comparable, releases of Domo in the future as well.",1255305600,14,2185,4.50253807106599

8352338,3,B00267QOI2,"My 11 year old is really into Domo, probably for a couple years, and so we thought he would go nuts over this.  Bought it for Christmas and we all sat down to watch it, but weren't really impressed.  We didn't get half of what was going on, and it was just kind of slow and.boring.  We thought it would be funnier - maybe we missed something?  Anyway, I would not necessarily recommend this just because you like Domo.  It was a bit disappointing, and my son didn't really like it, which was the whole purpose in buying it.",1392854400,,523,4.242424242424242
