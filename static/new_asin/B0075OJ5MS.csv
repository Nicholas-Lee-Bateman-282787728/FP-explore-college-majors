8510626,3,B0075OJ5MS,I enjoyed Ken but the person helping did not do anything for me. I think someone with a little more experience would have been much better for me to watch.,1480636800,,155,4.2
8510627,4,B0075OJ5MS,"Poor quality video, words sometimes not on the recording but you can tell he is talking, looks like someone shot this in their backyard. Ken has the skill set to teach, just not the production company.",1430697600,2,201,4.611111111111111
8510628,5,B0075OJ5MS,"Like all of the videos I've seen by Ken Gullette, this one is full of
practical and helpful insights. His teaching style is direct and to
the point so that many previously 'mystical' concepts become
simple and easy to understand - something few Masters manage
to do. Very useful to serious students of true Internal principles.",1388448000,3,327,4.857142857142857
8510629,5,B0075OJ5MS,"If you don't have access to a Chen Tai Chi instructor, I highly recommend this 2 DVD set on Silk-Reeling Energy presented by Sifu Ken Gullette. Actually, even if you do have access to a Chen Tai Chi teacher, you should still get this DVD set. As I understand it, Silk-Reeling exercises are designed to exercise the body mechanics used to power the Chen Tai Chi postures and forms. Ken's detailed instruction and teaching style shows you exactly what you need to know for each silk-reeling exercise. You can't go wrong purchasing this product. Top notch all around!",1329177600,6,564,4.76530612244898
8510630,5,B0075OJ5MS,"This is an excellent instruction on silk reeling, clear and with so many helpful tips to pay attention to while practicing! He breaks down and explains the concepts and movement so very well, it's a great resource for learning and practicing in the privacy of your own home, at your own time and at your own pace, and on such a difficult subject on which to find good teachings. Wonderful!",1328313600,6,389,4.571428571428571
