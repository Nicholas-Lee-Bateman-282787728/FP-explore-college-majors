1040765,1,6305495890,"This is not a sequel to any of the Crow films but the poorly-received pilot to the painful syndicated television series. Martial artist/Straight-to-video star Mark Dacascos stars as Eric Draven in this awful, watered-down retelling of the first Crow movie.
Just as he did in the movie, Draven has been resurrected from the dead after he and his girlfiend were murdered by a group of thugs. Though instead of hunting them down one by one and killing them like he did in the movie, Dacascos' Crow is out to teach them a lesson. How moving! Draven has returned from the grave to become some sort of an undead ""Big Brother"" figure. Gimme a break. This silly remake even has cop Marc Gomes (who will never be mistaken for Ernie Hudson) arresting The Crow for murder. What the hell?
""The Crow"" concept clearly does not translate well to the small screen. Where the original movie was a dark comic book style tale of love and retribution, this is more or less, a two-hour PTA message that ""two wrongs don't make a right"". If you though ""City Of Angels"" destroyed the Crow franchise, you ain't seen nothing yet.",1060819200,,1103,4.63265306122449
1040766,5,6305495890,"To me the Crow Stairway to Heaven was a great follow up from the orignal movie ""The Crow"". The second move of the Crow was a poor follow up. The Video Stairway to Heaven turned into a TV series followed the the  begining of the comic book and also the orignal movie but with a twist. He  doen't go back to rest like the movie. But the acting was great and the  story lines were very good. Mark Dacascos, does an excellant job playing  his part has Eric. And it was a shame that the TV series ended. Those who  say they true Crow fans that follow the comic book, should stick to reading  the Comic book and probably should subscribe to Marvel. The video to me is  a must see and if you can see the TV series, should.",965001600,7,715,4.064285714285714
1040767,2,6305495890,"The makers of this series don't seem to relise that the story of Eric Draven has been put on film and finished. They claim the Series is based on the Comic strip by James O'Barr but it appears that the have watched the  film and neglected to eaven go out and buy the comic as it is full of old  cleshays from the Brandon Lee film. This first episode is basicly the same  story line as the first film except with bad actors who don't suite there  rolls and don't fite the film or the comic. If you are a fan of the crow  like I am go and buy it, it's got a new twist to the story of Eric and  Shelly but it is still undoubtebly a cheep ripe of. Marc is terrible as  Eric and if you see this before the film you will want to know what all the  fuss is about. I suggest you get the film first then the sequell and then  the comic and if you have any money left over then get this. All in all I  guess it just isn't origanal enough, it would have been better with a  whoule new story.",957571200,4,980,3.825870646766169
1040768,1,6305495890,"I bought this video,thinking that this would be a the crow 3 with a new wonderful story. I could not have been more wrong. This is just a bad repeat of the brilliant first The crow video with Brandon. Lee. I was really  dissapointed. It had lost all the dark mood and beautiful pictures and  dialoges that the first movie had. This hasn't got that lovely depressing  feeling that the two first movies have. Its 'to optimistic to be a Crow  movie. Save your money!",952214400,,463,4.411764705882353
1040769,4,6305495890,"This is the opening two episodes for the Crow television series.  As such it is a remake of the original Crow movie but it has been changed so that it is better suited to an ongoing series, i.e. Eric doesn't return to the grave at the end.  It also introduces the Snakes, who are supernatural  enemies of Crows, setting things up for future confrontations.
On the  plus side, the series featured an exceptional cast.  Mark Dacascos, who  plays Eric, is a real find as he not only bears some resemblance to Brandon  Lee but also has some exceptional martial arts moves and can act as well.  It's a shame that he seems relegated to making B movies while Jean-Claude  van Damme and Stephan Seagal get the high profile martial arts flicks.  It's almost worth watching this video just to see him.  Sabine Karsenti is  lovely as Shelley and she and Dacascos have some real chemistry in their  scenes together.  And John Pyper-Ferguson does his usual good job as the  villainous Top Dollar.
On the negative side, production values are lower  since this was made for a straight-to-syndication television series.  As is  typical of this sort of effort, things didn't really start falling into  place until several episodes into the series when everyone started getting  really settled into their roles and the scriptwriters became more  comfortable writing the different characters.  At this early point,  everything still felt a little stilted.
Something that you may or may not  consider a bad thing is that it's also not as gloomy as the original movie.  While not exactly upbeat, its not depressing either.  There is an ongoing  theme of hope, redemption, and rebirth in the series and it shows in this  episode.  If you're one of those Gen-X sorts who likes to wear all black  and wander around complaining about how badly life sucks, this probably  isn't a version of the Crow that you'll enjoy but other fans of the  character probably do want to take a look at it.
Is it worth buying?  I  really can't see paying the current price (I hate priced to rent  stuff) for any video tape but if it comes down to something more reasonable  it's definitely on my buy list.  In the meantime, rent it and hope that  they eventually release the better later episodes as well.",947894400,37,2262,4.705128205128205
1040770,1,6305495890,"They basically took The Crow and redid it here. similar characters, names, some appearance and such, basic order of events, some lines. The actors are ALL different and barely look the same. It is not nearly as beautiful or  dramatic. Some lines are repeated, but with different context and no  feeling. It feels rushed. The city is not dark or rainy like the original.  It almost looks like it was made for a tv series. It's not really worth the  money, and I'd rather watch the crow 2 than this blasphemous remake. I  don't really know why they made it. It wouldn't make sense for this to  replace an out of stock original; it can just be re-released. I rented it  thinking it was the crow 3, but was disappointed and disgusted. it's not  worth it; they asted time and money in making it. I actually give it 0  stars but 1 was the minumum.",940723200,2,841,4.374193548387097
1040771,5,6305495890,"I've been a big fan of ""The Crow"" movies and especially the TV series.  This video takes the first two episodes and combines them into one excellent movie.  While the original ""Crow"" concentrated on  justice and vengeance, this Crow is still out for revenge, however he has  hope.  While he is not reunited with Shelly, as in the original movie, he  spends his time on earth righting the wrongs of the innocents who cannot  defend themselves.  This Crow metes out a moral justice, by letting the  ""bad guys"" live with the true horror of their deeds.  This Crow  also has a ""flair"" for the martial arts.  Mark Dacascos is a  champion and his skills are more than evident.  While this Crow lets most  of the bad guys live; he can still kick some ***.

1040942,4,6305495890,"I was a young lad when this series came out, and at the time had never before been exposed to any media related to ""The Crow.""  I remember taping the episodes on VHS and re-watching them constantly.  I was mesmerized by a concept and story that I found both entertaining and cathartic, and it holds a special place in my childhood memories.

Revisiting the show more than 15 years later, and now having seen the original film more than once, I did so knowing it wouldn't be quite the same experience as when I was a kid.  Fortunately, while the campy and cheesy elements are now far more obvious, it's still a blast.  No, it isn't nearly as dark or stylish as the movie.  Yes, it has heaps of silliness and some very questionable narrative decisions.  However, I think if you don't compare it too closely to the source material and instead take it for what it really is (a campy 90's action/adventure series) you might be surprised by how enjoyable it is.

I don't recommend the show for fans of the film or the O'Barr comics.  Rather, I recommend it to fans of 90's television.  More than anything else, the series has a lot in common with classic 90's campfests like Lois & Clark, Hercules, Xena, Relic Hunter, The Flash, Highlander, Forever Knight, Beastmaster, etc.  If you are a fan of any of these shows you will find much to love about Stairway to Heaven.  However, if you're the type of person who cringes at anything campy, cheesy or silly, this show is definitely not for you.",1441324800,2,1486,4.503731343283582

I love the Crow so I thought I would still find a way to love this, I accepted it was going to be different, but it was just so cheesy and the acting was terrible and the setting was all wrong and the characters were all wrong and I just couldn't decide whether it was too cringe worthy to watch or I should just think of it as a comedy but in the end I was going to poke my own eyes out with a fork so I had to stop watching it. It just made me think of a bad cheesy 80's show, even though I assume this was made in the 90's, it just made me think of Renegade or something along those lines. I just wish they had tried a bit harder and done a better job, seems like they had a pretty low budget and no reasonable actors who wanted to be part of it.",1431302400,,854,3.776536312849162

1041006,4,6305495890,"I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow/dp/B005EY2XFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow</a>&nbsp;is one of those movies for which everybody wishes no sequels or spin-offs were made, but because they were, we try to make the most of them. ""Stairway to Heaven"" - so far the only TV-based entry to the franchise - is easy to hate if you're too staunch a fan of the original film, but there are enough good things about the show that I enjoyed it. True, much of the writing is flawed, it could be much more stylized, and it scrambles to earn these four stars, but in the end, the hard work and passion of its creators shine through and I'm disappointed that only this one season was produced.

The story: the murdered musician Eric Draven (Mark Dacascos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>) returns from the dead with uncanny powers to restore the balance between good and evil - a task which must be completed if he is to be reunited with his deceased girlfriend (Sabine Karsenti,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Earth/dp/B00003CXIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Earth</a>).

The casting of the leading man is arguably the most important part of the show, because while Vincent Perez, Eric Mabius, and Edward Furlong typically aren't hailed as worthy successors to the late Brandon Lee, Mark Dacascos is the only one who's actually playing the same role as Lee. Brandon had too much character and charisma to be replaced, but I'd argue that Dacascos is a good choice to continue the part. He's a stellar martial artist with reasonable acting chops, and he even looks similar to Lee. While Dacascos has difficulty replicating Brandon's delicate sense of humor (his worst acting moments are when he tries to be silly), he demonstrates surprising depth by growing with the role, acting in scenarios that Lee's Draven never faced and coming across satisfyingly strong. He is the main reason I would have wanted to see the series continued.

The rest of the cast tends to do well, though they too bear the burden of replicating existing roles. Like Dacascos, the best thing the show does for these performers is allow them to make the parts their own over time, so that Marc Gomes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sue-Thomas-F-B-Eye/dp/B001992O0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sue Thomas: F.B. Eye</a>) fully realizes his own version of Albrecht and Katie Stuart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Wrinkle-In-Time/dp/B0002VEX64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Wrinkle In Time</a>) her own version of Sarah. Sabine Karsenti is able to take Shelly to places that Sofia Shinas never had the opportunity to. The only performers who don't come across favorably are those who are playing existing roles but have limited screen time, like John Pyper-Ferguson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alphas/dp/B00CRX82LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alphas</a>) playing Top Dollar for only a handful of episodes.

As the last sentence indicated, the story from the original movie is not the main focus of the series' narrative: only the first two episodes are given over to the Eric's initial revenge arc. Afterwards, the series takes a while to find its footing. At first it seemed as though ""Stairway to Heaven"" would become an odd version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renegade/dp/B003XMKU0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renegade</a>&nbsp;with Eric, Albrecht, and Sarah righting some new wrong every episode, but after the seventh program, ongoing arcs and subplots of obvious supernatural tone are introduced. Several plot twists are pretty darn cool - the coolest of which is probably the introduction of the franchise's first female Crow character (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobbie-Phillips/dp/B000053V92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bobbie Phillips</a>&nbsp;is well-cast) - but occasionally some downright weird ideas are set afloat, like when an evil occultist attempts to raise the spirit of Grigori Rasputin or Eric becomes involved in a soul-switching experiment.

I didn't care for some of the deconstruction of the Crow, not to mention the fact that a surprising number of characters become aware of his existence and identity, but definitely the biggest thing to get over is the look of the show. While almost all of the movies took place in downtown urban settings, at night, most of ""Stairway to Heaven"" takes place in bright daylight and in a number of less imposing venues. This takes some getting used to, and some viewers might never, but with that said, I don't think that many of the storylines played out during the day would have been particularly improved by turning off the lights.

The action content is, at first, a weakness of the series. While the franchise isn't solidly identified with martial arts, the inclusion of Mark Dacascos more or less demanded that the fight scenes be fairly stylized. Initially, this wasn't capitalized on, leading to many poorly-shot brawls. However, following the first half-dozen or so episodes, the filmmakers learned to pull the camera back and be less choppy with the editing. Each episode features at least two fights, usually three, and while no brawl is what I'd call a grade-A affair and Dacascos suffers from a deficit of credible onscreen opponents, it's nice to see him cut loose with his smooth forms. Mark also appears to do most of his own tumbling and gymnastic stunts, which is a plus for fans like me.

As of this writing, the show has been out of production for 15 years, and by now at the very latest, even die-hard fans should be losing hope that the series will ever be renewed. It's a shame, particularly given the season's cliffhanger ending and the disappointment that the following films were, but this DVD set is a nice thing to own. Again, rigid fans of the first film may not like this, but fans of action-thriller serials and 90s TV shows could become devotees yet.",1415491200,5,6277,5.816304347826087

1041071,5,6305495890,"I simply love this series, every minute of it.  Sort of like Angel, though much less tongue-in-cheek, deeper, and LOADED with heart.  Reminiscent of both Once Upon a Time and Person of Interest, in mood and tone, I thought.

As another reviewer said, each episode gets better and better, building slowly, developing character, and expanding the scope.  We begin with tragedy, and the birth of a being with superhuman powers, a la Superman- invincible, thrilling, see what he does to bad guys!  (""My God, what ARE you??"" they cry, as he metes out justice and rights wrongs.)  But slowly, it builds, deepens, exploring the nature of good and evil, death, our purpose here, redemption, soul mates, the power of love, and much more (such as recovery, friendship, healing).  It keeps all these balls in the air while developing the characters, we come to care about them, know them.  The plots are simple, actually incidental, the characters and their relationships with each other are core (as in any good story).

The series is actually one long story- characters reappear, threads begun before are taken up and brought to fruition throughout, often in unexpected and surprising ways.  Appropriate, too, I would say, for older teenagers (maybe 14 and up) and for spurring family discussions.  The series handles a wide range of issues honestly, yet tastefully (addiction, for example).

Mark Dacascos is simply marvelous as The Crow- alternately enigmatic, powerful, troubled, lost, charming, funny, an innocent.  Is he a lost soul, adrift between worlds, an angel, what?  Whatever he is, he's simply beautiful, in every guise and phase- his face, his body, his martial arts moves, the way he rides his Harley, the way he walks, grace personified.  And I love the way he delivers clever/funny quips, however great the menace.

All the actors are topnotch, and the show at times features beautiful scenery and special effects.  It also showcases music (in smallish doses) from alternative bands, and credits them at the end of each eposode.  And unlike the original Crow film on which this is based, we get to see rockstar Draven sing and perform, and Dacascos excels there too.

This series is subtle- it doesn't hit you over the head with things, the dialogue is simple, yet effective- to sum it up, it's absorbing, moves you from laughing out loud to tears to cheering for the good guys, just splendid, inspiring.  And for this price...Grab it!  I intend to buy another for backup.",1336176000,5,2480,4.970873786407767

1041073,5,6305495890,"I admit I will forever be a fan of The Crow original movie with Brandon Lee (RIP) for eternity. Which this made me sketchy when I heard this wasn't just another sequel, it was a redo of the story the film brought. Brandon Lee will ALWAYS be Eric Draven in my opinion and noone can replace him.

Though, on that note I started watching this series with an open mind and must say Mark Dacascos took a respectful approach becoming The Crow in his own right. Where the TV Show in my opinion doesn't, and never will personally, live up to the original Crow movie. I must say I find it an enjoying look into the world of The Crow to see what would happen if Eric didn't, or couldn't, get back to Shelly right away.

It has it's moments of cheesey fighting and even a few cliche lines that seem a bit forced at times from the actual original movie that make any die hard fan of the movie kind of roll their eyes.

Please don't be too harsh about this show or the movie's sequels, if you must and if you haven't already read the comics, check them out you can bye a good lot of them on here, and after you read the other great stories I think you will have a different view in new light about all of the crow movies and the show.

1041117,5,6305495890,"I recall watching this when it was on the air, but I had forgotten about it. After picking up this 5 pc DVD set and watching it again, it makes me hunger for more episodes. But alas! like the t.v. series ""Dark Angel"" we'll never know what would've happened after the cliff-hanger ending.
  A fan of the ""Crow"" movies, I personally liked Mark Dacascos as the ""Eric Draven"" character. He gives the character a sensitive persona when of course he's not in his CROW form. Striving to be reuited with his dead love & soul-mate ""Shelly Webster"" he tries to put right what goes wrong. Mark's martial artist skills come out beautifully in this series.
  The pilot opens basically re-telling the story as seen in the original ""Crow"" movie that starred Brandon Lee, but with a few adaptations & changes. One year after Eric and Shelly are brutally murdered, the mystical crow who has the power to bring back a soul, brings Eric back to life. Being neither dead nor alive he wanders the earth with strange powers. At first he goes after the ones responsible for the murders of him and his beloved Shelly, but then he teams up with the police Detective Albrecht in helping to solve other crimes. Yet, he never loses sight of trying to become re-united with Shelly somehow, someway or someday.
  If you're a ""Crow"" (or Mark Dacascos) fan, then I would highly recommend this set. But don't try to compare it to the other ""Crow"" movies, appreciate it for what it is a series in it's own light. I will treasure this DVD set & probably re-watch it, it was worth every cent that I paid for it.",1245974400,8,1575,4.508771929824562

1041119,1,6305495890,"Man--I wanted to like this, really...

The Original movie ""The Crow"" is one of my favorite films and while I thought the sequels got progressively worse--I still held out hope for ""Stairway to Heaven"" (1999-2000) as it is, like the original movie, based on James O' Barr's classic graphic novel. Unfortunately, however, ""Stairway to Heaven"" is probably the lamest installment in ""the Crow"" franchise.

Basically, this is a watered-down version of the original story, with terrible acting, horrible scripts, cheesy lovey-dove, vomit-inducing scenes and lame story lines. All around this sucks and has none of the brooding, bitter-sweet spirit of the film. Just look at the cover--that's pretty much a red flag as to how super-lame this series is.

It bored the heck out of me.
I found it dull and uninteresting.

this sereis remakes the Crow. it takes the same story and does it all over again. some of the same lines even crop up again. allthough the actor who plays the crow who delivers the same lines as Lee does so in a rather uninteresting way.

the fact is I don't see why they bothered to remake what was a rather good movie. yes part of it is the actors. not just because its not Brandon lee but its not Michael Wincott. Lee was the BEST actor to play the Crow. and frankly having some other actor play the part is a discredit to his memory. the actor who plays Top Doller in this series is not an impressive villen. Wincott who played the same charture stole all his sceans as Top Doller.

with the Movie you had a good actor playing the hero and a good actor playing the villen. you cant get any better then that.

and yet..several 'sequils' have been made off the movie.
and this tv series remakes the movie entirly
and it does it in a rather boring way.

the action, dialoge, actors, and so on all were uinteresting.
half way into the piolt I was bored out of my mind
waiting it to be over.

1041123,4,6305495890,"The short-lived television series `The Crow - Stairway To Heaven' is yet another incarnation of the popular movies chronicling the exploits of the tormented Eric Draven on his unending battle against the forces of darkness and his quest to join his beloved Shelly waiting on the Otherside. Building on the foundation established by the '94 cult classic `The Crow' starring the late Brandon Lee, this serialized retelling and extension of the Crow's ongoing saga stars Mark Dacascos in the role of the black garbed, supernatural avenger.

Mark is perfect for the part, succeeding in both emulating and expanding on the role and persona so vividly portrayed by Brandon. The television series also did an admirable job at duplicating the overall gothic atmosphere and morose melancholy that permeated the original film. Someone definitely did their homework before going into production of the series.

In my opinion the glue that holds the saga together while adding depth and dimension to the storyline is the tragic love story between Eric and Shelly. It's their ethereal, intermittent meetings between this world and the next that constitute the soul of the Crow mythos and validates his reasoning for battling on. This romantic, gothic essence is beautifully recaptured in this television series and should help to draw more female interest to an otherwise male dominated audience.",1205366400,31,1383,5.281818181818182

He comes back as a Crow to right the wrongs.  Watch the the first episode, figure out the plot, factor in the overdone pining for a lost love, and this show should have been complete garbage.  It should have been, but it really is quite a gem, easily on par with McGyver episodes.

Maybe what makes it is that some of the scenarios in the show are just perfectly done, like the trial where he's accused of killing his girlfriend because he can't account for where he's been the past year (he was dead), which if you think about it makes real life sense.  What would the cops do if they found somebody a a double homicide, prounced them dead, buried them, then the person shows up again a year later?

Who could forget those opening words. I was so shocked and happy to see that this series is finally being released on dvd. I had actually looked for it last year, because my tapes (taped from the tv, not a release) of the season were getting run down and basically in bad condition. Normally, I wouldn't flip through the TV Guide, but I did and found the little insert about The Crow: Stairway to Heaven being brought to dvd! I was amazed that it took so long because of the loyal cult following that the Crow movies started. They knew they would have buyers, so I really didn't get why it took as long as it did.

The show of course revolves around Eric Draven, very much like the movie, and his many friends. The show only lasted for a season and a half, being abruptly taken off after only five episodes into season two, I believe it was that many. Anyways, if you liked the movie, you are sure to like this series. Its got martial arts, drama, danger, intrigue, and all that good stuff. Also the dvd includes many bonus features including commentary from Marc Dacascos(?), and creator Bryce Zabel. There are outtakes as well it seems, and behind the scenes of at least one or two episodes. All in all, I think they are giving fans what they want with this five-disc set.

**Update**

I just recieved my copy in the mail today and right now I'm watching the first episode. The quality of the dvds is excellent, and the picture is crisp and clear.

1041302,5,6305495890,"This was a great show, too bad there was only one season.  Crow purists may bash this show, but I think it was interesting how it expanded on the Crow universe.  It needs to be taken on its own merits- of course when you compare everything to the original movie, nothing is good enough.  As a matter of fact, the comic books that started it all were much darker than even the original movie with Brandon Lee.  So everyone should just shut the hell up and quit harping on the differences, and just enjoy the show for what it is.  Mark Dacascos does a fine job as Eric, and his martial arts experience makes for terrific action scenes. He also looks enough like Brandon sometimes to give you the chills!  This Crow is a bit sweeter, and more hopeful than the first, but it doesn't make this series any less worthy, in my opinion.  The only thing I don't like about this set is the pictured box art- just get rid of that ugly, glaring TV Guide logo and it would look so much better.

For instance, at the end of the first two hours, there still has to be a plot left and characters still have to have room to grow. In that, Stairway more than succeeds. It creates a whole new world in the Crow mythos, a kind of ""what might have been"" that just gets better with every episode. The music in this series is great, too.

Mark couldn't win me over with his portrayal, especially with his outfit inspired from the movie that I thought looked horrible, specifically the coat.

Mark Dacascos was an excellent version of Brandon's Eric. And Sabine was an excellent Shelly. The many things that Eric had to do to make things right weighed on him, as it seemed an endless task that would never release his soul to be with Shelly. There was so much more that was able to be written regarding their intertangled lives that would have carried it through, at least, another full season. The last episode showed Shelly with a little boy going to the light. She tells him that she can't go and leaves the light. She stands on the edge of the bridge, just as Eric had before her, and jumps. We see her  disappear into the real world like Eric had and that is where it is ended.
