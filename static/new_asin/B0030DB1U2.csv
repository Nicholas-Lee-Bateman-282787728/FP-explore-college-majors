8385799,1,B0030DB1U2,I looked forward to seeing these because of fond memories of Durango and Raider as a child.  Unfortunately they are almost unwatchable as the quality is so poor - both audio and picture.  I don't recommend them.,1349654400,12,211,4.675675675675675
8385800,3,B0030DB1U2,"A comprehensive selection of Durango Kid adventures - we loved 'em on Saturday mornings at the movies - repetitive,yes, but fast moving and action packed with great comic relief from Smiley Burnett. Print quality varies from fair to very good.",1297123200,11,243,5.1
8385801,5,B0030DB1U2,"The Durango Kid was another masked avenger of the west.  A number of black and white Grade B movies were made featuring the character.  The Durango Kid was popular in the 1940's.

If you like the old western masked avenger theatrical movie series.  You will like the Durango Kid movies.",1272844800,10,286,4.66
