5609596,5,B00BEMH2LS,"A much needed version of Georges Simenon in the vernacular, so to speak. Subtitles are a little odd but then you'll be speaking French by the end anyway so who needs 'em?",1394323200,,170,4.34375
5609597,5,B00BEMH2LS,"Set 7, covering episodes 37-42, of the French television Maigret series featuring Bruno Cremer is among the very best of the entire ouevre.  As we have come to expect, Cremer's acting as the fictional Commissaire of the Paris Police Judiciare is superb.  Just as important, the varied cast of directors has produced highly nuanced and visually attractive episodes. At least three stories in this set (Maigret and the Minister, Maigret Goes to School, and Felicie's House) also feature in the BBC Maigret series with Michael Gambon, a bonus for aficionados interested in comparing treatments of the stories.

As with other sets in this Maigret series, this one is pleasingly diverse. Several episodes set in Paris involve Maigret's team of Quai des Orfevres  investigators, while those set in towns far from the capital rely essentially on the work of Maigret alone. These away-from-Paris episodes, such as Maigret and the Madman of St. Clothilde, highlight the patient, slow-to-come-to-judgment, and psychologically insightful style of the Commissaire.  Maigret and the Princess is also notable for it focuses on the lives and interactions of just two significant characters, an elderly pair of star-crossed lovers.  Its elegiac tone and elegant pace make this episode a most atypical police procedural.",1384041600,8,1303,5.394088669950739
5609598,5,B00BEMH2LS,"Enjoyed all of this series.  Plots are well constructed, little or non graphic violence evoking thought provoking solutions.  Great practice for improving one's French. Wonderful scenes of French villages.",1378684800,,205,6.0344827586206895
5609599,5,B00BEMH2LS,Somehow or other each successive series of Maigret gets better. I have loved all of the 1-6 series but the stories in this series are the best. Have purchased series 8 and can't wait to watch it. Hopefully the last series 9 will be available in the near future.,1369353600,,261,4.346938775510204
5609600,5,B00BEMH2LS,"Bruno Cremer gives the finest and most believable portrayal of Jules Maigret; I believe it is possibly the closest to the intent of Simenon in his novels. Maigret is an unconventional Chief Superintendent, with authority that extends throughout France, and his detective work takes him throughout that country, populated with vivid and believable characters. The plots frequently take turns that are unexpected (both to the viewers and to Maigret himself), no two of the episodes are alike, and the work of the directors and writers is essentially free of the ""glitches"" that sometimes occur as a result of last-minute editing. I think that Maigret is the outstanding model for the investigative police officer and that Bruno Cremer is a gem among the actors who have portrayed him. These DVDs are expensive but definitely worth the money. By the way, they are set in France shortly after the end of World War II, and the backgrounds are 100% coherent with the settings.",1368057600,3,970,5.031055900621118
