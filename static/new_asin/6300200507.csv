7805956,3,6300200507,"This episode hardly features Patrick McGoohan as No. 6, but some other guy plays him.  No. 6's mind is transferred to another man's body, and this other man is a total disappointment.  No one can take Patrick McGoohan's  place.  The Prisoner was Patrick McGoohan's show, and he can't even be in  it.  The other guy had to play No. 6 while Patrick McGoohan was off doing  Ice Station Zebra.  If you are a Prisoner fan, you really should watch it,  considering there are only 17 episodes to watch.  The episode itself isn't  bad.  It's pretty exciting and you get a feel for No. 6's personal life  outside of The Village, but if you're not really interested in The Prisoner  but more of just a Patrick McGoohan fan, don't waste your time and money on  this episode, BECAUSE HE'S NOT IN IT!",949363200,3,787,4.4822695035460995
