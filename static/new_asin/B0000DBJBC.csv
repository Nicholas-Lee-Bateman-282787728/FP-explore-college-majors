1922702,5,B0000DBJBC,"I walk 3 miles per day and play soccer 1-2 times per week and consider myself to be in fairly good shape.  I guess I never realized that the exercise I get does not do much for stretching, toning, and strength training.  I have done this dvd 5 times now and it is challenging.  My ab strength must have been non-existent as well as my upper body strength. I found this dvd quite hard (so far) and it definitely makes you break a sweat.  Good dvd...hopefully I will become more flexible and strong so that this workout won't be as difficult.",1170892800,3,540,4.316831683168317
1922703,4,B0000DBJBC,"This is an awesome workout. I am in the worst physical shape of my life, I weigh over 200lbs, and I am able to do this workout using the modifications she demonstrates. It is challenging and an hour long but I am able to sweat through the entire workout. I have only been doing it for a week. Started on Monday and was very sore and wobbly through Wednesday when I forced myself to do it again. I was glad I did because it helped work some of the soreness out. Today is Friday and I just completed my third session. I feel great and the soreness is barely noticeable. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt she could have focused a little more on proper breathing technique. It is yoga after all. I also wanted more of a full body stretch at the end. Other than that I recommend this workout. It is definately worth the money. (Can you believe Tari Rose is in her forties with 2 small kids? She looks late twenties in this DVD.)",1163116800,6,929,4.166666666666667
1922704,5,B0000DBJBC,"It's easy to follow even if you're not a yoga expert.  Has a great section of ab workouts.  It's an hour long, but goes fast.  You'll really be working up a sweat with this one!  I definitely recommend it.",1127606400,5,205,4.17948717948718
1922705,4,B0000DBJBC,"This is not spiritual or flows in any way, this is yoga for muscle building only. There is no instruction on breathing or body awareness. The music is the usual cheap, lightly annoying noise music from gym classes.
This is yoga converted into a toning gym class for the not faint of heart.
The stage is stark white & Tari shows modifications with the two backup women.
What's great is Tari Rosi is very friendly, has great enthusiasm, you can tell she loves this workout & isn't annoying even though she does a lot of counting when she does the moves slowly or when holding it. If it wasn't for her, this dvd would be very, very boring.
To do this, I would say you'd have to have endurance & decent muscle strength to start with. My first time, I couldn't complete it, though tried the fwd bend/chair pose & abs section & found it a good moderate to advanced workout. though I have yet to complete the whole thing since it's long & definitely challenging.
She does basic poses normal speed a couple of times, then super-slow in the count of 10 2x, then normal again a couple of times. She builds on different areas such as back, shoulders, butt, abs, etc.
Such moves are standing fwd bends/chair, downward dog/upward dog, bridge also w/single leg up, warrior 2/side angle (bound too), side plank, etc. Each two pose exercise is done for several minutes.
The last section for the abs has leg lifts/down, laying spread legs up/down w/a crunch, pilates like shoulders & straight legs up & going up/down slightly & 1 or 2 other exercises. It ends with some nice spinal twists. No meditation of course.
People who want the toning/balance aspect of yoga will love this, those who want body awareness & keep their mind on their body by the more authentic yoga should look elsewhere.

1922706,5,B0000DBJBC,"I bought this video not knowing much about yoga (although I once did a yoga class and I've done quite a bit of pilates).  Anyhow, my lack of yoga experience really was not an issue.  I was able to go through the entire routine and learn all the moves.

I have done many cardio videos, but this video offered something new for me.  I actually found it challenging!  It really stretches you out and my arms were definitely shaking by the end!!!!  This will tone and stretch your entire body!!  I really enjoyed this and I actually had to do some of the modifications for the exercises.  All exercises were great, but I felt the abs section was not that effective for me... then again I have very strong abs.  For each exercise she will do them 2-3 times fast and then they will be done for a slow count of ten.  This really works you!

  A solid DVD, easy to follow, works your body, I am hooked!  I recommend this for ALL levels of fitness.  Modifications of the exercises are shown for begineers. (I am at an advanced exercise level and still found this video to be worthwhile).",1092614400,18,1078,4.346733668341709
1922707,4,B0000DBJBC,"I've never tried Yoga but I'm very active and do lots of aerobic exercises.  I wanted something that would not only provide good stretching but would give me a strong body and challenge my muscles.  After the first work-out I knew I had scored big time.  I was sweating but I felt GREAT!  The next day I knew that I had a great workout, as my muscles were speaking to me.  I advise that you watch the video first because it's hard to get instruction (watch the TV) while your head is down and in yoga positions.  Tari is a great instructor and has a pleasant voice with clear instruction. This one will definitely keep my workouts fresh and fun while achieving the results you might get from weights.  Highly Recommend!",1083110400,7,719,4.442748091603053
1922708,4,B0000DBJBC,"I also bought this dvd based on recommendations (especially on Collage.com) this is definetley not a regular yoga workout and no, it's not power yoga either!  It's strength training based on basic yoga poses but don't get me wrong, this workout is not basic , it's very challenging , I think all my muscles were  sore a day after I did this.  The workout consist of segments which starts with sun salutaions and than a few segments of lower body and than upper body for a few times and in the end there's  an abs section which to me was more for the legs than the abs, and than final stretch.  Every exercise is done 4 times x 3 sets with every 4th time is performed really slow so your muscles will work very hard. It was a very ""sweaty"" workout
and I think it's good when you get bored from your regular yoga workouts or just want a diffeent kind of strength training. 66 minutes.",1079136000,17,882,4.289156626506024
1922709,5,B0000DBJBC,"I tried this workout because it got some great ratings.  I can now see why.  This work out is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, I would say that the overall workout is on par or maybe a step below a primary series (ashtanga) workout.  The poses themselves are not beyond the experienced beginner level.  However, it is what she does with them that makes the workout intermediate to advanced.  She will perform a given pose repeatedly in regular speed, and then in super slow motion. It is this super slow motion that really builds strength and endurance, because you just can't know how to perform the pose, but you have to be able to hold the pose for a while.  In addition,  the abs section of this work was very challenging for me.  Just so that I don't scare off anyone new to yoga who wants to try this DVD, Tari does offer you the option of watching the pose performed first, then you can follow along with either the full or modified version of the pose.  This DVD was 60+ minutes of sweat and work.  If you are ready for a fairly intense workout then give this a try.",1076284800,21,1079,4.266009852216749
1922710,4,B0000DBJBC,"Finally, a video that lives up to its claim of being challenging and advanced.  I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser who is often discouraged after purchasing tapes that claim they are challenging/advanced, yet are actually intermediate at best.  I am here to tell you that this tape is definitely advanced.  It is an hour long and you will feel every minute - you will actually begin to wonder if it will ever end (and I mean that in a good way).  This was my first experience with this instructor (Tari Rose) and found her to be enjoyable.  She expained the exercises well and offered decent modifications to make the video a bit less challenging.  If you are looking for a relaxing yoga tape - stay away from this one.  However, if you are looking for a challenging tape that you can keep in your rotation for a while and grow with - I would recommend it.",1074988800,9,864,4.464968152866242
8000503,5,B0000DBJBC,It's good...not easy...but nothing that will show results will be easy.  I like how she breaks up the routines into ten minute sections focusing on different parts of the body.  You can choose to do some are all of them.  Im a guy...in decent shape whose worked out with weights for years trying to get into yoga...I was worn out by the end of the dvd.,1493424000,,352,4.303030303030303
8000504,5,B0000DBJBC,Everything is great. Have no complaints.,1474243200,,40,5.833333333333333
8000505,3,B0000DBJBC,I'm giving this 3 stars because it does get my heart rate up.  However most yoga tapes aren't that great ans this is no exception.  I will stick to Ana Brett and Ravi Singh Kundalini Yoga tapes.,1444089600,,194,4.216216216216216
8000506,4,B0000DBJBC,"But be forewarned, it's not your standard yoga ... not sure how to describe it other than it takes advantage of some yoga poses and makes them infinitely harder (in a good way).

Amazingly, this workout will tone your entire body, especially your core just using your own body weight as resistance.  She offers plenty of modifications for those who are just getting started.

The only thing I would change about it is the terrible background music but once you learn the routine, you can mute the TV.",1395273600,,500,4.659090909090909
8000507,4,B0000DBJBC,"This was a very active, moving yoga routine.  For those familiar with holding poses and getting into a zone will find this to be much different.  This incorporates muscles up and down your body and I really enjoyed it.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because some moves can put strain on your back if you aren't using the right muscles and she never made mention of that.  But if you are aware of your core & how to use it properly you should be fine.  Made my arms feel like Jello jigglers by the end.",1369267200,,516,4.12
8000508,5,B0000DBJBC,"This is a wonderful DVD!  I tend to be a bit on the stocky side, so I like doing strength building that combines cardio and/or stretching.  I also have a neck that can easily get out of whack, and weights can aggravate this if I'm not careful.  I frequently do Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's Kundalini Yoga DVDs as well.  I would consider myself in good shape; not gym rat kind of good shape, but good shape nonetheless.  Another thing worth noting is I own many workout DVDs, and have grown picky about which ones I do.
  This workout is very challenging.  Tari Rose goes through a sequence of true yoga poses; at the end of each series you do one in verrry slooowly.  It's not power yoga; in fact, the challenge is in slowly, smoothly moving through each sequence with control.  While motions-wise, this is genuine yoga poses, it lacks the spiritual aspect some other yoga DVDs possess.
  It's really too bad she hasn't come out with any other DVDs, because I really like her style.  She has put together an effective workout, and she's very pleasant.  This isn't the cheapest yoga workout you'll buy, but it's certainly worth the money, and I'm very happy with my purchase.  Were she to come up with other DVDs in this style, I would buy them in a second.",1265846400,,1254,4.462555066079295
8000509,5,B0000DBJBC,"I love the video. Tari is very passionate about her workout and it shows. I found it hard but not too hard, as there are different levels instructed by other instructors in the background. I hope to be at Tari's level soon.  The music is pleasant and not too loud.  Everything is explained very well and I will be buying another for my mother, as she would enjoy this DVD. The great thing about the DVD is that you can build with it as it may take you a while to be able to complete it at the expert (Tari) level. I also have signed up for Tari's nutrition class on her site...cant wait.",1263340800,,587,4.140350877192983
8000510,5,B0000DBJBC,Hard-Body yoga is amazing. I love the burn you feel the next day. It's a combo of strength training and yoga.,1214179200,,109,4.238095238095238
8000511,5,B0000DBJBC,"I have been doing fairly intensive strength training for years but, even though I definitely toned up, it still wasn't the lean look I was after.  On a total whim and the reviews I decided to give this a try. About the 3rd week I started to see definite transformation of the body, especially in the chest area. Not that barrel-chested type look but instead, the lean muscle look . It is pretty intensive but Tari efficiently alternates working the body parts so you can keep going.  I don't write reviews often but this program really works!",1211068800,,542,4.577319587628866
8000512,5,B0000DBJBC,"Like many of the other reviews here, I recommend this DVD for anyone who's interested in a tough workout you can do at home.  Using yoga-based moves, you work hard for about an hour and if you're not in good shape already, you'll probably have to modify some of the moves until you get up to speed.

I can say that if someone does this workout for 3 days a week, you'll get in shape for any sport or activity pretty quickly.  It's convenient and works your whole body with movement for strength, flexibility and oh yeah, you'll love the ab workout toward the end of the program.  Your body will, too.

The music is pretty much the generic ""high energy"" kind of stuff you'll hear in a gym or whatever, but it's not so bad.  I'm usually too busy trying to hang with the workout sequences to be a music critic anyway.  The setting isn't some beach or anything, it's just a studio with mats and lighting, but again, so what?  You're working out, not doing a travelogue.  Tari Rose and her two exercise assistants go through the workout with enthusiasm and more difficult variations of the sequences are demonstrated by one of the three as you go along, so you can add difficulty to the moves if you're ready to go for it.

Highly recommended.  5 stars.",1193097600,6,1248,4.406113537117904
