963682,5,6305079161,"This DVD contains the majority of a two-day celebration of the Metropolitan Opera's first 100 years. While its origin in 1983 prevents it from being sonically 100%, the performances are simply fabulous! You'll see  why the ""three tenors"", Pavarotti, Carrerras and Domingo, deserve  the fame that they enjoy. You'll see and hear why Dame Joan Sutherland was  called ""La Stupenda"" by her fans. You will see and hear the most  ravishing singing of two scenes from Der Rosenkavalier, which will convert  even the most ardent operaphobe. You will marvel, as I did, how  sensitive  and youthful the late Alfredo Krause sounds in the love duet  with the  simply splendid Catherine Malfitano) from Romeo et Juliette. With nearly  four hours of marvellous singing, with arias, overtures, duets, trios and  ensembles, this disc will be replayed over and over at our house -- and  yours, too. My usually objective wife was clapping and exclaiming  ""bravo"" as the performances progressed, and properly so. Don't  miss this one; and its perfect as a gift for any opera lover or anyone who  is curious about what opera is all about.

ADDENDUM: When I initially reviewed this disc, it was a release on Pioneer Classics, not the re-mastered DGG edition featured here. I just added the DGG edition and can update this review accordingly. The picture is cleaner; the colors are more intense. The DTS surround sound is the biggest plus for me because it provides some ambience that suggests a sense of ""being there"". It is not as dramatic an effect as is the case with the new HD technology, but it is a significant upgrade that amply justified the expenditure for the 2 disc set. My earlier comments on the quality of the performances is unchanged. It's a chance to see some of the Golden Age singers of the second half of the 20th Century.",954633600,59,1822,4.810289389067524
963683,2,6305079161,"I now own this DVD as well as the VHS original, the only improvement is visual, I find the recording very very poor. I would venture to say that with proper adjustments I can get better sound and volume from the VHS.  Should you buy the DVD ?  Yes ! Yet don't expect much, and try to enjoy it  as a photo/video album of dying stars.",953769600,18,332,4.0
963684,5,6305079161,The Met shines in this gala there are scenes that will absolutly blow you away.  Levine is at his peak and his conducting of the Bartered Bride overture is superb.  A MUST have for any serious opera fan,943660800,12,202,4.2894736842105265
963685,1,6305079161,"The 1983 Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala was perhaps the classical concert of the century, with most of the greatest, still-living voices in attendance and participating. But Pioneer Classics DVD recording of this  concert is the recording crime of the century. From the opening notes of  the Overture to the Bartered Bride to the final ""Happy Birthday"",  the sound is so grossly distorted that it is almost totally unlistenable.  When I played the first copy of the disc I bought, I thought that there was  something wrong with my speakers or my DVD player, but other DVDs sounded  wonderful. I returned the first disc and ordered a second thinking that the  first was simply badly copied. But the second disc is just as bad. Pioneer  Classics should withdraw this DVD from production until a recording worthy  of the event can be produced. Please don't waste your money on this DVD. If  you love this music and these performers as I do, you will only be enraged  at the injustice which has been done to both.",919641600,74,1013,4.764367816091954
7882710,5,6305079161,"One of my favorites. All star cast singing some of the greatest aria, duets, etc. in all of opera. The video and sound are what is to be expected from 1983. But it's well worth it for the chance to see and hear many of the greats of that era.

Just don't be fooled by the gluttonous resellers here. This DVD (the newer, better Deutsche Grammophon release of it) is not out of print and is available elsewhere for a tiny fraction of the cost.

I used to play this DVD over and over for my mom, when she was in the later stages of A.D., and she (and everyone else watching) couldn't stop smiling. Enjoy.",1426636800,,601,4.172413793103448
7882711,5,6305079161,"Each day now we discover some old movie or video that is being reissued in Blu Ray. Should not this incomparable superlative record of the Metropolitan Opera's October 22, 1983 Centennial Gala be so treated and in it's entirety? This original issue on VHS, then Laser Disc and now on DVD contains about half of the total program, broadcast on PBS in two parts on that October Day, one at 2 PM in the afternoon and the other at 8 PM that evening. Who determined at the time that half of the program was to be excluded with such performers as Norman, Thomas, Lear, Crespin, Milnes, Morris, Quilico, Plishka, Winbergh, Devia, Daniels, Neblett, Estes, MacNeil, Arroyo, Duhn, Moffo, Merrill, Elias, Resnik, Hines, Amara, Cossoto and Shicoff not shown? Five stars are granted for what is here and a goose egg for what is not here. Two subsequent MET Galas, the 1991 and the 1996 were especially well done, but, neither is as lengthy and did not include as many of the MET's well known performers. Enjoy this incredible record for what it includes, but, be deeply saddened for what it does not include.",1416700800,,1095,4.678756476683938
7882712,1,6305079161,"I was expecting the double album AND a legitimate DVD.  this is a chinese reproduction, I don't know how they get away with this.  I'd ordered it as a gift and only now found out is was a copy.",1373932800,,193,3.923076923076923
7882713,5,6305079161,"This is a fantastic collection of many of the best voices in opera singing some of opera's ""greatest hits"". As someone who did not appreciate opera until recently, I really enjoyed being able to see some of the great singers that are no longer performing. This would be a great addition to any opera lover's collection. It is also a wonderful collection for someone who is just beginning to explore opera and would like to be exposed to a variety of composers and performers.",1287532800,,475,4.666666666666667
7882714,5,6305079161,"I gave the dinner party of a lifetime for this event, and, with friends bringing their own tape decks, recorded every minute of the 8 hour event perfectly.  It is now transferred, complete with commentary as broadcast, on 6 cds.  (But not the intermission features.)  What a treasure!  The late Timothy Jenkins singing Rienzi's aria is worth the whole effort.  If you know how to get in touch with me,  I can copy it for you.",1251504000,5,425,4.526315789473684
7882715,5,6305079161,"This is a wonderful DVD for showing family or friends why you like ""great singing.""

This gala performance celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Metropolitan Opera--and they do it in a way they can be proud of.

There is more talent assembled on this stage than you can imagine!

A quick glimpse:

Roberta Peters stands out in the sextet from Lucia di Lammermoor, as she hits the high notes with grace and ease.

Kiri te Kanawa presents Mozart as only she can do it.

James McCracken brings down the house with his impassioned singing of Otello--it requires a (seemingly interminable) several seconds for him to recompose himself from his anguished aria about Desdemona.

Alfredo Kraus and Catherine Malfitano sing Romeo and Juliet with such passion and love that it is not at all difficult to imagine them as the young star-crossed young lovers.

Nicolai Gedda sings Una Furtiva Lagrima--Donizetti would be applauding!

It's just one memorable aria after another!

Jose Carreras and Montserrat Caballe with POWERFUL singing...

The trio from Gounod's Faust will bring tears to your eyes--how can that melody be repeated so many times and still affect us so?!

This is just one supreme performance after another, and I haven't even mentioned the performances of Pavarotti and Leontyne Price, Birgit Nilsson's Isolde, or the fabulous ballet baccanale from Samson and Delilah.

At the end, all these talented performers appear together on stage, and sing a refrain of ""Happy Birthday to You, Metropolitan Opera.""  It may sound corny, but when you look upon the tremendous appearance of so much talent together at one time on that immense stage, it is moving.

Invite yourself--and some friends who enjoy great music--to this consummate musical feast!",1177891200,12,1750,5.112676056338028
7882716,5,6305079161,"First of all, I would like to thank Amazon and Pioneer Classics for bring us the chance of enjoy such a wonder like this ""Centennial Gala"" in DVD format. I love classical music, and of course, I adore the opera. And this is the perfect ocassion to FEEL and ENJOY the talent of all the magnificent artists that keep music alive. There is only one objection I would like to say about this DVD edition. I understand that the gala was too long and cuts must be done, but I wouldn't mind paying more money as long as I would have the entire gala, because is in my opinion, an unequalled celebration. For example, there was a magnificent quintet of Bizet's Carmen with excelent voices of members of the Met, which is not included in this DVD release. I'm sorry but mutilations like these are not wellcome. As student of a Music Conservatory and pianist, I consider that this marvelous Gala must be released ABSOLUTELY COMPLETE, in two or three DVDs if it's necessary. Anyway, thanks again for give us the opportunity of enjoy the Centennial Gala: the greatest show on earth of all times.",1094256000,7,1081,4.5487179487179485
7882717,5,6305079161,"This was my 1st dvd purchase. For this operaphile, this is the Mount Olympus of the arts. The performances were extraordinary. Vocal mastery was in abundance. It's difficult to single out specific exemplary performances. The phenomenal Eva Marton set the mood with her searing version of ""In questa Reggia"". The collaboration of Battle,Von Stade& Soderstrom for the ethereal final trio from ""Der Rosenkavalier"".Carreras &Caballe scaling new heights with the finale from ""Andrea Chenier"".The limpid beauty of Madama Butterfly's Act 1love duet sung to it's zenith by Leona Mitchell & Giuliano Ciannella. The list goes on & on. 4 hours of pure listening pleasure. The fashion police ,however,must have been on stakeout at the other end of town. money well spent!!!",1050364800,18,761,5.35
7882718,5,6305079161,"A priceless treasury of some of the greatest voices and conductors of all times all in one place.  Excellent sound.
You'll love Leona Mitchell.  What happened to her?  She is the obvious successor to Leontyne Price, my heroine of opera.",1044662400,9,236,4.85
7882719,5,6305079161,The Gala DVD was as good as I remember the Gala.  What a pleasure to hear and see the singers from 1983. Thanks for the DVD release.,975110400,5,132,3.888888888888889
