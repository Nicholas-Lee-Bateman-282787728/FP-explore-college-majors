6164598,4,B00HHYF548,"after all this time, I thought this video would look better than the VHS and it really doesn't.
and I would have liked some interviews with actors or director or anyone associated with this production.
Someone must be alive.
Four stars ...it's still great fun, exceptional, to watch this set of actors, this cast, bring life to these characters.
And to the time in which it's set.  IT's arch, it's camp.  Great satire on England of the period.  All the characters have their foibles.  I would join them for a ""po de mu.""  I watched a short excerpt of the 2014 cast and while I'd like to see more of it,
it doesn't replace the original.  Prunella Scales' Mapp couldn't be more different than her Sybil Fawlty characterization.
She is a marvel.  Everyone is.  Geraldine McEwan, Nigel Hawthorne. First rate cast. I haven't seen it for a long time because I stopped watching the VHS tapes.  I am
a great fan of this production.  Really wish they'd included some extras on this DVD.",1470096000,4,977,4.595375722543353

6164658,3,B00HHYF548,"I had seen the 2014 BBC series remake of Mapp & Lucia and enjoyed it, so decided that it would be fun to see the earlier version as well. When the box set of DVDs arrived I hurried to binge-watch them all. The DVDs of Series 1 played fine, but imagine my disappointment when I tried to play the DVDs of Series 2 only to get a message on my screen that they were for a different zone! I had visions of the hassles of sending them back etc.(I live in Australia).  I pointed out the problem to my husband and he commented that Amazon had no business advertising DVDs if they couldn't supply for the correct zone. He then had the happy thought of trying them on his computer, which did not have the zone problem and I was relieved that I could finish my binge-watching without any hassles.
I enjoyed both versions very much and would be hard put to select a favourite. The costumes in the later version were far superior, and there were even more outlandish plot lines not included in the original, longer series.
I have just ordered the books for my kindle, so will soon find out if these plots were in the books or made up by the series writers.
If you like older British humour, then these are enjoyable to watch (if you can get your discs to play!).",1436400000,8,1249,4.270042194092827

That guy could really span a range of roles.  As with every BBC production I have purchased I really need SUBTITLES.  C'mon you folks at Amazon, put pressure on the source of the BBC DVDs to have them come with SUBTITLES.  No, backing up and replaying does not, NOT, compensate for poor sound production.

6164689,4,B00HHYF548,"Enjoyable period piece, 1920's I believe, and the characters are likable. Its based on a feud between opposing ladies with similar effected character. Light hearted humor and good conversations mixed with a power struggle between the two ladies of the village. Each wanting to be the queen of the town. I think this is one for the older set  or well read.",1421712000,3,355,4.725806451612903
6164690,5,B00HHYF548,"First off, I felt the title should have been Lucia and Mapp instead of vice-versa but that would be abductive reasoning which EF Benson might frown upon, even if Lucia (Lu-chee-a, get it right!) will prolly be slyly pleased. Only a British male writer could so delightfully project feline attributes on two women of a certain age and before I knew it, there went my precious holiday off spent sitting in front of the TV set while the post-prandial to-do list languished on the kitchen table.

I think it's sad that nowadays we simply say ""Bitch"" to whoever displeases us. It reflects the falling standards of the time. A bitch implies barking and absence of grace, bereft of the subtle intelligence and seriously sharp claws typified by Mapp and Lucia. Do you watch Downton? Then allow me to say that Mapp and Lucia is like the Dowager Countess and whoever's opponent of moment, amped to the nth degree. If you like that sort of thing, this TV show is a must. If nothing else, you will, like me, learn how to skilfully deploy an endearment such as ""Dear"" in a statement in a way that leaves no doubt as to your true meaning.

Not being a cat connoisseur, I may be inaccurate in thinking of Lucia as a feline of the well-brushed Persian variety while Miss Mapp as the well-fed house marmalade. But really who cares about the fur wrapping when they are both sisters under the skin, each giving as good as she gets? Lucia, being the richer and more polished (and pretentious) has the slight edge. Were she alive today, she'd be the type most women love to hate because she seems to have it all, also she has a man for her bestie, rather than a woman.  Miss Mapp will likely be the one most women profess to like because she's, well, a bit of a loser. I mean, sodden Major Benjy (Quai Hai!), for heaven's sake!

Nigel Hawthorne is the same chappie who delighted us as the tedious Head Bureaucrat Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister/Prime Minister, except that here he plays 'mio Georgino', second fiddle to Lucia. He's only the second man in fiction I've read who likes to embroider; the first was Judith's Uncle Robert in Appleby's End (Michael Innes) of nearly comparative vintage.

The rest of the cast are great, too, though I must say they're simply foil for Mapp and Lucia. Padre ""Begorrah"" stands out for his ability to keep a straight face and bow out when the gossip gets too zingy.

I cannot wait for tomorrow, UK Boxing Day's TV schedule, for the newest re-make starring Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor, respectively, as Mapp and Lucia.

6164782,5,B00HHYF548,"MAPP AND LUCIA, (1985).  This newly re-released to DVD classic British television series, a comedy of manners based on the popular novels of E. F. Benson, introduces us to two indomitable women.  In 1930, the recently widowed Mrs. Emmeline ""Lucia"" Lucas moves to the --fictional --quaint, conservative village of Tilling.  Where, irresistible force that she is, she engages with the immovable imperious object of Miss Elizabeth Mapp, longtime queen of the picture postcard pretty seaside village, for social/political/artistic leadership of the town.

The 10-episode series, made by ITV for BBC4, was first seen on British TV in 1985-6, and on American PBS channels shortly thereafter.  This fey cult favorite comes as a boxed set of four DVDs totaling 502 minutes -- 8  hours-- that give us a generous helping of country scenery, local color and fishermen, and barbed and tasty  satire, as the two women wage  war for social supremacy, fought with lobster recipes and teacups.  The series was adapted for TV by Gerald Savory, directed by Donald McWhinney, and features constellations of stars.  Unfortunately, due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, the viewer may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on this DVD presentation that were beyond the ability of Acorn/RLJ Entertainment to correct from the original materials. And, it does not come with subtitles, which may impact upon some viewers' enjoyment of this witty entertainment.

As Lucia, we have star of stage and screen, Geraldine McEwan (AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE).  As Mapp, we have the beloved Prunella Scales, (Sybil Fawlty of FAWLTY TOWERS), who has worked long and hard and is still working. In the entertainment at hand, a viewer would have to say she must work a lot harder than McEwan - Lucia is largely a one-note character-- whereas Mapp must go through many more changes.  As Lucia's foil, Georgie Pillson, we have Nigel Hawthorne (THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE; YES, MINISTER).  Other stars of the series include Denis Lill, as Major Benjamin `Benjy' Flint, Mapp's foil; Mary McLeod as Godiva `Diva' Plaistow; James Greene as `Padre' Rev. Kenneth Bartlett, who affects a Scottish accent; Cecily Hobbs as `Quaint' Irene Coles, who paints.  Geoffrey Chater as Mr. Algernon Wyse, whose sister is an Italian countess by marriage; and Marion Mathie as Mrs. Susan Wyse, MBE - and she wears that medal seemingly 24/7.

Well, we love this quirky comedy in this house, though I must say, upon our initial viewings, years ago, we obviously had better hearing.  This time around, we missed some dialog, a shame, as it's so enjoyable.  But we were always able to follow the action, and were mightily entertained, even so.",1395446400,10,3868,5.130781499202552
6164783,5,B00HHYF548,"If you think the Dowager Duchess of Grantham and Mrs. Isobel Crawley have cornered the market on rivalry and satiric insults, you must see Mapp & Lucia.  Set in the 1930's and based on the entertaining novels of E. F. Benson, Lucia (or Mrs. Emiline Lucas) and Mapp or (Miss Elizabeth Mapp) battle for the honor of being top society hostess of the seaside village of Tilling.  In this 1980's series viewers join the war as Lucia relocates from her home in Riseholme to the unexplored Tilling.  She already has a ""history"" with Tilling's leading social hostess, Mapp who upon a visit to Risholme has had the audacity to ""steal"" Lucia's cutesy pet phrase habit of bidding people ""oh reservoir"" and claiming it to be her own, and also does not seem to appreciate Lucia's fascination with and apparently proficiency in all things Italian.  The Tilling elite go back and forth on their support of these two, watching as each lady skewers the other with barbed comments wrapped in genteel language.  Lucia is devious and wickedly clever in her attempts to best Mapp, putting on little dinner parties with music and a fete with herself as star performer, all in Mapp's house and garden which Lucia is renting for the summer.  Mapp is angry, but not above sinking to snooping and even thievery when it comes to the acquisition of Lucia's signature dinner dish ""Lobster a Risholme.""
  This witty and wonderful series is well worth watching.  If you are revisiting it, it is as wonderful as you remember, and if you are not familiar with it, I envy you the first viewing.  The language and the manners of the 1930's along with the attention to style and character make this such an enjoyable production.  It stars Geraldine McEwan, Prunella Scales and Sir Nigel Hawthorne.",1394755200,51,1761,4.759868421052632
6164784,5,B00HHYF548,"FUN character driven series. I also own the Acorn VHS tapes, which I can now toss. Top performances by a core dozen and loads of other guests. Even the British laughed at this farce of small seaside society, its quirks, and its conspiracies, not to mention social cliques.
Geraldine McEwan (Miss Marple; Barchester Chron.) as Lucia leads brilliantly. You grow to love her shenanigans. Her ally in classless bickery, a tweed, Georgie (Nigel Hawthorne) performs with Lucia in a stream of LOL piano duets. Their primo foe is Prunella Scales as Mapp, devilish in action, unscrupulous, but always puts the lady-proper face to it all. Ignore the nasty role, and enjoy her grande performance.
Viewers choose which characters to like and loathe; which to ""cheer"" and which to ""hiss and boo."" Reminiscent to similar powerful character development of Dickens & Brits' TV series ""Doc Martin.""
The longer you view, the louder you laugh.

It's a period comedy with episodes mention of 1930 & 1931. Costumes are period correct, but like all series aspects-over the top original. This battle betwixt 2 genteel social climbers is based on the novel work of E. F. Benson who died in 1940, years prior to this 1985-86 adaptation; but I think he would have smiled.
The only negative, this re-release as a complete collection has no subtitles or CC.

I must mention a few other favorite characters: `Quaint' Irene (Cecily Hobbs -`One Foot in the Grave') a pipe-smoking tomboy nude artist; `Major' (Denis Lill) drinking golfer of the marrying type; Vicar (James Greene) a Scott by accent; `Diva' (Mary MacLeod) main cohort of Mapp.
