8499961,1,B006K1JGYE,"I bought this based on my earlier experiences with this series which were filled with lots of original footage from the recording studio and some great retrospective interviews with the band members...
NO SUCH THING HERE: the band members are not part of the documentary.
Lots of interviews with people who had been around - band members of other bands, music journalists etc...although what they talked about was interesting sometimes, most of it was sooooooooooooo boring that I didn't make it to the end of the DVD.
Sor tof like a James Bond movie without James Bond himself...too bad because I was really looking forward to this.
musician interviewed whose only claim to be there was that he filled in for one concert because one of the band members had broken his hand...too bad they didn't interview the janitor who cleaned the bathroom after jimmy page went to the bathroom!
PS: the same could be said about the DVD of Led Zep's Physical Graffiti album.",1446854400,,960,4.824242424242424
8499962,4,B006K1JGYE,The item was in good condition. I thought it was the actual albums on CD though. This is a DVD about the albums.,1438732800,,112,3.9130434782608696
8499963,2,B006K1JGYE,"i guess it's interesting a little, but not so much. it's dated too because it talks whether chinese democracy will be coming out (and of course it did years ago). it isn't put together so well - - and the second disc is really lame (especially the graphics).  get the guns n roses books, not this.",1339718400,2,297,4.303571428571429
