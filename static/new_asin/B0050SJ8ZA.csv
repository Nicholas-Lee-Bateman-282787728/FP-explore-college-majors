This love story from Korea has the tenderness of snowflakes carried gently from the heavens on a soft winter breeze. From its sepia-hued opening to its final shot, this film will gently squeeze your heart until you feel the ache of love, and smell its fragrance. Filled with moments of great romantic beauty and heartbreaking sadness, its complex story is told with a simple grace and elegance, making it one of my personal all-time favorites.

Kim Ha Neul is endearing as Soeun, a shy college student in love with classmate Donghee. Their story of gradually getting together has a sweet innocence of yesteryear. It is in stark contrast IN (Yoo Ji Tae), whose girlfriend is brash and quarrelsome. He is concerned, in fact, that she may be sliding into alcoholism. But underneath there is a yet untapped depth which will flourish near the end of this story. It is the otherworldly manner in which their paths cross which is at the crux of this film.

Souen's life in college consists mainly of visiting the hospital where her best friend, Sumi, is recovering from a broken leg. But late at night, she begins talking on a HAM radio to IN. But the radio, given to her by another student, is reportedly broken, and does not work. Their conversations are at first contentious, she disbelieving of his claim that he is attending the same college, but 20 years later. Much to his girlfriend's displeasure, he makes arrangements to meet Souen. But it is a bridge too far to traverse. Each initially believe the other stood them up. Her continued concern about current events, however, prompts him to give her news of future happenings. It is then that both realize something very special is occurring; they are living in different times.

Whereas most films would use this as a device to propel their love across time love story, director Jeung Gueon Kin and photographer Kwang Suck Jung take this in an entirely different direction. Soeun and IN do come to care for each other, however, he becoming her diary for her fledging romance with Donghee, while he wrestles with his girlfriend's drinking, and her skepticism that what he's telling her is actually happening. His sudden realization that his parents are attending college with Soeun leads to a romantically heartbreaking bit of information that changes both their lives forever. It also changes his girlfriend's mind about what has been happening, and she decides to support IN. In an emotionally gut-wrenching scene, he discovers the scent of love still remains. To reveal anything further would ruin the experience for those who have yet to see this piece of film magic.

It story unfolds in a deceptively simple manner, its touching depth sneaking up on you at the end. The two most wonderful things about this film are Kim Ha Neul's lovely performance, and the hauntingly beautiful score. A film which takes something from your heart, but gives something greater back. A must see for romantics.",1311552000,3,3003,4.8803921568627455
