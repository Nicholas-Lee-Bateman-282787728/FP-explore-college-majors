When you talk about the ""Summit Series"" you are talking about the ""Golden Age of Hockey"" when two world dynasties divided the ice between two warring idealogies and playing styles. Canada ruled the Western Hemisphere while Russia dominated the Eastern World. The only problem was that because of the existing guidelines governing international competition they weren't allowed to play each other. Professionals (i.e.: the NHL players) weren't allowed to participate in international events because they were designated for amateurs only.

Conversely, the Soviet team, who were also military personal, were allowed to maintain their amateur status. The argument being they were paid for being soldiers, not hockey players (POLITICS!).

In 1972 when Russia agreed to face Canada on the ice in an eight game series, four in each country, the sports world came to a standstill. The Soviets were determined to prove that their reputation as the best in the world was deserved, while the Canadians believed that their day of redemption was close at hand.

Remember, it was the time of the ""Cold War"" and Russia was the enemy. There was nothing nice about these athletic confrontations, both sides truly hated each other. And why shouldn't they? Both teams were the best in the world, but that was all they had in common. When they played each game became the microcosm for our world in conflict. It was East versus West, Communism versus Capitalism, God versus Satan. To win was more than just a matter of retaining National Pride, it was a justification for a way of life.

This 4 disc set is for the hardcore fan who loves ""Old School"" hockey. Be forewarned, the eight game series presented on these DVD's are exactly what was televised across Canada in '72. If your old enough to remember that long ago you know how poor the viewing quality was back then. Just remember it's not necessarily quality of picture you're after here, it's history, hockey history! When you hear those famous words, ""HENDERSON HAS SCORED FOR CANADA!"" you'll finally understand what it was all about.

The Summit Series was a once in a lifetime event never to be repeated and probably the only opportunity you'll ever have to see some of the legendary Soviet players like Valeri Kharlamov and Vladislav Tretiak who were never allowed to leave Russia and play in the NHL. Buy this DVD set while you still can.

More than just a game, it was a time when Hockey was Religion!",1129248000,11,2679,4.887665198237886

I ABOSULTLY love it!! it has taken over my life and now with my extensive knowledge i have bought this DVD. IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!! it has boosted my love for the game played @ a professional level. They best sort out the 2004/2005 season because i cannot wait!!",1103328000,,361,4.402985074626866
1750143,4,B00006FMCJ,"The cultural value is great, but that's for the event. The DVD in itself is completely raw: not work at all was done to restore the footage. The result is the digital transcript of a deteriorated copy. However, the material is excellent and abondant: interviews (great ones!), game presentations, and more. Overall, it's a great buy for that price.",1092873600,,348,4.915254237288136
1750144,5,B00006FMCJ,"As a 10 year old, I was glued to the TV during this series.  I've spent the past several nights time travelling back to 1972.  Sometimes in life you can't go back.  In this case you can.
There are a lot of great interviews with the players in 2002.  Think about how often you hear baseball players say winning the World Series is everything.  Think about how often hockey players say winning the Stanley Cup is everything.  Now imaging Phil Esposito, in a post game 2 interview, saying that single game win is better than winning the Stanley Cup.  Cournyer said something similar (per Gary Bergman).
Game 6 is as good of a game as you'll ever see.  I couldn't believe how many guys got knocked to the ice.  I also now realize how great Phil Esposito was.  He was often ridiculed for scoring garbage goals on rebounds.  He was a lot more than that.
If you're a hockey fan, and/or you remember the tension between North America and the USSR in days of old, buy it!  It's $35CAN very well spent.",1082073600,3,992,4.3901098901098905
1750145,5,B00006FMCJ,"Ah, what memories!  There will  never be another series like it.  And to the Customer from Calgary: Europeans play hockey with as much intensity as anyone -- it's just that Europeans play it with intensity of hockey players, whereas Canadians with intensity of street thugs.  Hence, you keep getting Bertuzzis, McSorleys, Domis, Hunters, et al -- all fine Canadian hockey players who should be in jail.",1080950400,,402,5.045454545454546
1750146,5,B00006FMCJ,"Great deal here, two CD's, while other places sell each one seperatly, plus free shipping, what a deal!
As for the game, it definately was the best ever because it was more than a game, it was a clash of cultures, idea's, faith, and politics.  As for the Swede who said Canada won because of cheating is wrong.  Canadians didn't try to stack the deck with horrible refs, wake up the players in the middle of the night with phantom phone calls, loose their equipment, steal their food, box the visiting team fans into a corner, restrict movement in the city and out and out just make life miserable over there.  I think the Swede is just jealous they got beat cleanly in the pre-russia games.

1750147,4,B00006FMCJ,"This one is actually something as rare as a complete game set of the 8 games summit series from 1972... The games included are considered some of the best ever played featuring the great USSR and Canada. It's really obvious watching this DVD that the Soviet team actually was a bit better than the Canadien who had to cheat; they almost cut Charlamovs fot of to stop him, if the Canadien players would have played fair and by the rulebook they would have lost bigtime. Anyway its a good collection of great hockey.. The only downside is that the footage is very bad althrough entire DVD, and you might get tired watching 19 hours of hockey. If you only want the highlights of every game in great quality buy the Summit series DVD it is +++++++!",1069372800,,744,4.477941176470588
1750148,5,B00006FMCJ,"Most people in Canada were glued to a television, any television for this series. The years gone by have not dimished its' significance. If possible the passing of time has enhanced it all the more. I was in university at the time and he still talks about the 1972 Canada/USSR Series, and Foster Hewitt (the best hockey broadcaster ever) with reverence. Having all eight games available in their entirety is great!",1036627200,,414,4.845070422535211

7967954,4,B00006FMCJ,"It's hard to review the product vs. the actual games. I cannot give the eight-game series other than about ten stars out of five because of the insane drama that it produced and the memories it evokes.

Putting all that aside and looking at this box set in the light of day, it falls a bit short. First of all, some of the interviews that follow the individual games often do not refer to the games in question. (Also, how is it possible they released this mispelling Dennis Hull's first name as Denis? Did they mistake him for a French-Canadian player or maybe they assumed he was Denis Potvin?) Why not just do a new documentary on its own with these new player interviews? Also, where are the actual documentaries I've seen on TV done afterwards? I'd love to have seen them on this especially showing how we Canadians all watched the games at school, living rooms, bars or even in shop windows.

The Montage DVD extras have great pic quality because they are shot on film stock but have no narration at all. The 2002 Return to Luzhniki is nothing other than a Jean Chretien and Vladimir Putin photo op. I was expecting some sort of oldtimers game to be honest.

Included is a team photo and a booklet that has the game summaries so obviously do not open this up, if you wanted to watch the games fresh again without knowing the scores, scorers, etc.

Also, if this is the ""complete"" story of the 1972 Team Canada journey, throw on the exhibition games in Sweden and Czechoslovakia (actually called ""Game 9"" on many DVDs out there to signify Stan Mikita's return to his homeland has some meaning). Just a thought as I've seen all these on DVD, and they are just as wild especially the games in Sweden. In fact, pre-tournament I remember the Red and White Team Canada intrasquad games being on TV (most likely on cable not CTV) because the level of interest going in was that high.

To be perfectly blunt, the games are fine, but I have seen better quality transfers to DVD elsewhere. Forget this 2004 one and go for the 2007 box set ('72 Complete - The Ultimate Collector's Edition of the 1972 Summit Series) that has all the games plus three excellent documentaries on the Summit Series.

Finally, as a kid I had no idea but now I can hear how terrible Foster Hewitt was at play-by-play. OK, he's a Hall of Famer and was the first true pbp guy but it's ""Corn-why-eh"" not ""Cor-noyer"" for Yvan Cournoyer and it's also Serge ""Sa-vard"" not ""Sav-ard."" Sure, I'll cut him lots of slack on the Russian names but from the first game he blows the call on Canada's second goal completely messing up the goalscorer. The guy was 69 years old in 1972. Voice was still good but now I think why wasn't the best play-by-play announcer Danny Gallivan used?

Brian Conacher, though, is excellent on color especially for the times. His international hcokey background having played for Canada at the 1964 Olympic team gave us all some real insight and analysis into the Soviet/Russian style of play and really he was a ""Meeker"" ahead of his time.",1352419200,,3030,4.538461538461538
7967955,5,B00006FMCJ,One of the best hockey series of all time if not the best. The goaltending of Tretyak and Tony Esposito is phenomenal. It pins two of the greatest hockey teams ever assembled against one another in a battle between nations. It is truly a must have for any hockey fan. It is amazing to see the contrasting styles between the two teams and how the game today has changed and been created as a result of combining these two styles of play. Just a great series and like I said a must have.,1245974400,,485,4.225806451612903
7967956,5,B00006FMCJ,"We got this on sale at Blockbuster because my 7 year-old hockey fanatic son wanted to see ""live"" hockey.  They found this for us and it has been fabulous. He has enjoyed watching every game and in the beginning had no idea Canada was going to win.  He then proceeded to get the book, ""The Greatest Goal"" by Mike Leonetti and then some of the suspense was lost. Still, it didn't deter from his enjoyment and ours as well.  A great historic series -- if you or your child loves watching hockey, it is a must. The picture and sound quality occasionally falters but it still holds up.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greatest-Goal-Hockey-Heroes-Series/dp/1551925745/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greatest Goal (Hockey Heroes Series)</a>",1206230400,,774,5.655172413793103
7967957,5,B00006FMCJ,"I first saw some of the Summit Series replayed on TV a few years back. I'd heard and read a bit about it. Once I watched the games and went to all the websites I realized just how momentous this was at the time. You had all the elements of prime time drama. Our national heroes suffer a humiliating first-game loss when everyone expected them to annihilate the Soviets. They come back with a gutsy win at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, have a lead get away on them and end up with a tie in Game 3 (felt more like a loss) and then the fourth game in Vancouver when the Soviets skate laps around us. No matter what their social background or the way they were developed, the Soviets proved they were just as talented, physically robust and courageous as North Americans were. They took a commanding 2 games to 1 lead and the Canadian public basically blacklists and disowns Team Canada as a bunch of 'frauds' and 'slackers'. Hence the famous TV tirade by Esposito when he acknowledged what we were up against and that the players were really busting it despite a comparative lack of conditioning.....Then they go behind the Iron Curtain, contending with late night phone calls, stolen equipment and constant harassment from Soviet bureaucrats. Seemingly on their own in a foreign land, they unexpectedly see 3000 Canadians fly half way around the world to fill Luzhniki Arena. They play a strong Game 5, only to have it slip away from them late. Now they are close to contending with their Russian foes every step of the way. Game Six features Team Canada battling the Soviets and some questionable refereeing, as they make it a series again. The seventh game, a dramatic hard checking defensive battle sees it 2-2 going to the third period. Gilbert scores making it 3-2, but a Canadian penalty sees the Soviets tie it up. And then perhaps one of the most infamous cheap shots in hockey history, as Bergman and Mikhailov get into a massive scrum along the boards. Mikhailov kicks Bergman skate blade first and the victim responds with a piston house right on the kicker's jaw. And that Henderson guy ends up beating 2 Russian defenceman and then Tretiak for the winner. All tied up with 1 game left. Soviet officials realize how close they are to losing this political prize, so they try some back room trickery. They attempt to bring back the 2 biased German referees who worked the sixth game . Canada draws the line, and says they won't play if they don the whistle. One of the greatest games of all time almost got cancelled! So each team gets to pick one ref. All taken care of right?  Nope...Canada finds itself 2 men down 3 min in and Yakushev makes it 1-0. Then Parise gets called for interference, and tensions come to a head as he gestures as if to slash the German official . Parise gets tossed, Team Canada throws a fit...And yet somehow, we hang in there. It goes back and forth. A late 2nd period burst sees Russia up 5-3 with one to go. Cue Esposito for the goal to make it 5-4. Then Cournoyer ties it all up. But not without more drama. The goal judge does not put the light on , and Eagleson feels they're going to be cheated again by Mother Russia. Trying to get to the scorers booth to ensure the goal counts, he's picked off by Soviet soldiers. Team Canada charges over the boards and fends off the captors. Eagleson gives a middle finger salute to the goal judge and the Soviet big wigs in the stands as hes escorted back by the players. The USSR says theyll claim a series win if the game ends in a tie based on goal differential. There's a goal mouth scramble, and then perhaps the most famous broadcaster's call in sports history ......Canada does the unthinkable. Beats the Soviets coming back from a 2 game deficit on THEIR ice. Sticking it to all the officials and politicians who tried to foil them, re-establishing themselves as national heros and changing the game forever. You tell me how a modern Hollywood script-writer can beat this!  It is in my books the greatest series ever played in hockey history.",1182297600,6,4035,4.541208791208791
