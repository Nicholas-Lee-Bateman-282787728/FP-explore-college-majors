7455130,5,B0160STWAY,Classic family never gets old. A well worked formula that gets better with time as they add new characters and further develop existing characters.,1452211200,,147,5.166666666666667
7455131,3,B0160STWAY,The spine was completely broken.  My DVD was only packaged in a bubble envelope.  It looked like someone rolled over my item.  That was disappointing.  Everyone likes a clean and unbroken box.  Luckily the movies were fine.  And the show is awesome.  My rating is on shipping.,1451865600,,276,4.74468085106383
7455132,1,B0160STWAY,"These discs do not work. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I got myself all ready to sit down and watch me some Family Guy and not one single disc in this package works. ALL THREE discs will start, show the FBI warning, show the 20th Century Fox logo and then they stop. And no matter what I tried, they WILL NOT WORK! Extremely disappointed and I will NEVER buy from these people again.",1451433600,2,380,4.219178082191781

7455134,2,B0160STWAY,"CENSORED - the ""uncensored"" sticker - like the one on ""SuperJail"" Season 3 - is JUST a sticker, bears no relationship to the DVD inside. A critical scene is blurred out and audio is censored on the extras. A decent enuff season of FG but NEVER TRUST PACKAGING. I'd return it if I could...",1450483200,11,288,4.351851851851852

7455174,1,B0160STWAY,The writing of family guy doesn't really bother me until this over the top season that forcefully made points on how they felt about Christianity. Jokes are jokes but this was a target attack that was way to much. I love Seth's work but he needs to get control over his writers or he will lose loyal fans!,1461542400,2,305,4.275862068965517

7455180,1,B0160STWAY,"Very poor season. Not funny at all. The last disk has some funny episode moments, like the Liam Niessen one, but the rest are really lame. I don't think Seth Macfarlane was there for much of the season's writing. The episode ""Simpson's Guy"" is luke warm at best. Brian's episode as a real estate agent has a couple of really ugly scenes of him having his teeth bloodily knocked out, which is framed as comedy. It isn't funny, it's just grotesque. A couple things are clear though. The Cleveland character is useless. He's just a reminder of how far the show has come since he left. And Chris's character can't hold attention through an episode. He's a cliche at best. Also there are no deleted scenes. Oh they put some scenes on the dvd as ""extras"", but they are merely removed dialogue. No dirty jokes, no swearing, no innuendo. This season is a vanilla mix of flat ideas and stale humour. They'd better do a shake up or FAmily Guy has had it.",1456963200,3,944,4.46242774566474
7455181,5,B0160STWAY,First off: I've been waiting for months fit this season to be available for it is the only season of Family Guy I was yet to see.
