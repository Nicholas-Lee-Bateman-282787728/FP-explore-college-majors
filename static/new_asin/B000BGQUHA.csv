2416182,1,B000BGQUHA,"MAZES AND MONSTERS is a movie about a group of college friends who are bound together by their interest in playing a role-playing game entitled ""Mazes and Monsters."" To take the game to the next level and to make the experience more interesting the group begins playing the game in a local cavern. One of the players, Robbie (Tom Hanks) begins having visions and as the lines between reality and fantasy become confused in Robbie's mind, he sets forth on a life-threatening quest. Discovering his destination, his friends set out on a race through New York City to save him before he ends up killing someone or even himself.

MAZES AND MONSTERS is a silly movie made and released during the early 1980s about the dangers of role playing games. In the early 1980s there was a large anti-role playing movement, specifically against Dungeons and Dragons. The movement charged that the games were occult based and that people who played the games became possessed or that they slowly lost their minds and ability to distinguish reality from fiction. Though there were only one or two reported cases of such disillusionment, most of the claims from the anti-D&D camp were shown to be false. Such claims seem funny nowadays, but at the time they were a big deal and were to be taken seriously. Thus, books were written, tv shows were made, and films were produced and we ended up with a lot of crap like MAZES AND MONSTERS.

Normally, the appearance of Tom Hanks in any film is enough to raise the quality of any film or television show. Considering also that in MAZES AND MONSTERS Hanks is supported by a cast of talented actors the acting alone should be enough to raise the quality of the film. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this film. The writing, effects, sound, lighting, and directing are just so bad that there is no way for the actors to overcome the deficit. For instance, at one point during what is supposed to be a night scene, there is a fly on the camera lens. Some would argue that MAZES AND MONSTERS is one of those movies that are so bad that they are good to watch. Those arguments are made in vain. MAZES AND MONSTERS is just plain bad. The only reason to watch it is to see a rare film that Tom Hanks is now probably kicking himself for having made or to get an idea what the anti-role playing crowds of the early 1980s were all upset about. Other than that, watching this film is like throwing 90 minutes of your life out the window.",1156291200,,2459,4.536036036036036
2416183,5,B000BGQUHA,"When Robbie (a young Tom Hanks) returns to college after being thrown out of another school for playing too much ""Mazes & Monsters,"" his new friends Kate, Daniel, and Jay Jay convince him to take up the fantasy role-playing game once more. Unfortunately for Robbie, the line between fantasy and reality blurs with tragic results.

--

So bad that its good, this is one film that Tom Hanks probably wishes he could expunge from his career. In fact, if it weren't for Tom Hanks in the cast, this movie would have languished permanently in a film vault somewhere. Those that remember the film ""Meatballs"" fondly should note Chris Makepeace in the role of Jay Jay.

Made during the 1980s anti-Dungeons & Dragons hysteria, this is one film you wish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew would have lambasted; An overly sentimental and hastily made B-movie (based on an overly sentimental hastily written B-grade novel), this is best watched with a group of friends, a six-pack of beer, and a huge bowl of popcorn. However, without Tom Servo or Crow T. Robot, you'll have to supply your own heckling.

Great fun !",1156204800,4,1107,4.780104712041885
2416184,3,B000BGQUHA,"All the references to this movie paralleling reefer madness are dead on the money.. the dominant theme is definitly one of 'D&D style games will destroy lives'.  The primary salvaging feature along these lines, and the indication that the director's intent was benign is an insightful comment by the mother toward the end that the game was merely an outlet for problems he was already experiencing.

  That being said, ignoring any political agenda, this movie rated toward the upper ranks for a 'B' rated flick.  Do not rent this looking to enjoy a fantasy story, for while the characters are engrossed in their own fantasy, we do not truely get drawn into this.  Rather, this allows for more of insight into some roll players lives with a twist toward stereotyping rollplayers as rich hyper-intelligent social rejects.  Watching this movie, I get the impression the directing team had a conflict between empathy for roll players, and a desire to ride the hype of ""D&D is evil"".

  Ultimately, this makes a fine movie for when you have time to kill, and want to watch a touching story of overwhelming grief.  If you pay more than $5 for this though, you're going to feel like you've been taken.  (I paid $5.50, so have mixed feelings :-)",1149465600,3,1238,4.76056338028169
2416185,1,B000BGQUHA,The movie stinks except for excellent photos inside and out of the Twin Towers which comes at the end of the movie. All in all it is about 4 college students that are friends that get to involved into playing a game called Mazes and Monsters( Dungeons and Dragons spin off).The board game turns into a role playing game where Robby who is played by a very young Tom Hanks becomes to unrealistic and truly believes he is ahigh priest seeing monsters and going on a quest upon which he looses his mind and tries to kill himself by jumping off one of the Twin Towers (2 Towers in the game) so he can join his deceased brother. His 3 other friends track him down and rescue him from his almost fatal decline over the side. End of story. Boring to say the least. The only great part is like I mentioned above is the Twin Towers!,1144972800,3,823,4.248407643312102
2416186,2,B000BGQUHA,"A 1982 tv movie has resurfaced, showing us that yes, Tom Hanks was a very young man when he was making his first movies and tv series.  Sadly enough, this movie is dull and pretty uninvolving.  It tells the story of four college students who play a game called Mazes and Monsters, which ultimately results in Hanks' losing his focus on what is and isn't real.  There's no real suspense and the dialogue just panders along without any real crucial meat to it.  Hanks shows a spark of what was to come, but even he can't rescue this one.  Add a young Wendy Crewson (SANTA CLAUSE MOVIES, THE JOANNE KILBOURNE MYSTERIES), Chris Makepeace (MY BODYGUARD) and cames from some well known supporting players: Vera Miles, Anne Francis, Lloyd Bochner, Murray Hamilton, Peter Donat, Louise Sorel and Susan Strasberg, and you have a competent cast in a sorely developed storyline.  Author Rona Jaffe's book may have been interesting, but this movie sure isn't.",1141171200,,947,4.814814814814815
2416187,5,B000BGQUHA,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and loved every second of it. Based 0n Rona jaffee's novel of the same name(its a super book) It really isn't a ""reefer madness"" about role playing(although the ""D&D made me kill"" hysteria of the early 80's most likely enabled this movie to be made). Great performances by Hanks and Makepeace. Honestly its a dysfunctional comeing of age piece. Jay Jay is the rich kid who just wants to be loved and is comeing to grips with his parents emotional distance, Robbie is haunted with the belief that letting his brother take money from his wallet and not telling his parents directly caused  his stabbing death in the city. Things start out innocent untill the stresses of real life start to drive robbie  over the edge

after checking the reviews I do have to warn that this movie like many other 80's tv shows and movies are most likely only going to be enjoyed by those who liked them way back when",1134172800,6,937,4.5

Tom Hanks is great in an early role as a gamer gone over the edge of reality. Yes, this movie is stupid and insulting to folks who enjoy roleplaying games, but it is a FUN kind of stupid and worth a look when you and your friends have ""bad movie night"" at your house. It is rather fun to see gaming exploited in a cautionary tale that makes it look like the next great plaugue that will assasinate America's youth. Worse than crack you know.

2416203,4,B000BGQUHA,"Yep, first there was ""Reefer Madness"" (1936) telling of the pitfalls of smoking reefers. Now there is mazes and monsters madness. An undetectable force that you are powerless to resist.

Tom Hanks as usual fits comfortably in any role he plays. The theme may be a little dated, but it is still fun to watch and speculate ""There but for fortune go I"".

As you have guest the story is about a role-playing game that gets out of hand. Tom Hanks plays a person that might not be quite stable and the addition of this game feeds his fantasies. This leads to a mysterious disappearance. This is more of a physiological movie than a blood and guts type. Before people say what is real or not, different people will come to this movie from different backgrounds, and go away a little closer.",1505865600,8,783,4.507042253521127

2416209,5,B000BGQUHA,"After-school specials hit their peak in the 80's. Usually these films were low-budget, overly dramatic, overacted, hamfisted stereotyped sermons about the dangers of a particular topic. This film is all of that, only with Tom Hanks. We get it, Dungeons and Dragons can destroy your life. We also got the sub-plot of the damage that is caused when parents and their children don't address loneliness and emotional trauma in healthy ways.

But, ironically, this film reveals some depth about understanding depression. If you finish it, you'll either realize that you were so depressed that you actually wanted to finish this movie and that you probably need to see a counselor, or you'll become depressed because you have nobody to talk to and nothing better to do with your time than to finish this movie and that you probably want to see a counselor so that you have somebody to talk to. Let's face it, nobody is watching this with another person. And no, your cat doesn't count as a person. Neither does your spouse/significant other/roommate who fell asleep 15 minutes into it.

""But,"" you might argue, ""didn't you finish the film?"" Yes, yes I did. And my wife was asleep, I don't have a dog, and I probably should see a counselor.

Tom  Hanks  does  admittedly  give  a  good  performance,  the  psychotic  break  is  convincing,  and  this  could  almost  have  been  saved  if  instead  of  blaming  a  game,  they  took  a  look  at  the  idea  of  when  people  blur  the  line  between  fiction  and  reality  in  their  minds.

James liked to play Dungeons and Dragons but he was having emotional problems. And after he left a suicide note he entered the network of steam tunnels that snake their way beneath the entire campus.
I still remember the media reporting for days that he was thought to be down there somewhere playing D&D. But all the time he was hiding at the house of some friends.
A few years later I attended MSU and we talked about going into the steam tunnels because we knew the story. But getting caught meant immediate expulsion (as mentioned in the movie about the caves).

2416228,3,B000BGQUHA,"What a strange little 1982 time capsule this is.  With a youngish Tom Hanks to boot!  Is it a ""good"" movie?  Not really.  The story itself is standard 80's fare about college kids feeling parental pressures to get a job, find a spouse, become a software engineer, etc. Only these four kids decided to escape reality by immersing themselves into a Dungeons and Dragons style role playing game where they assume fantasy character identities and have late night dorm room adventures.  There is a romance between Hank's character and the only female in the group (played by an actress in her 30's), some suicidal kid who wears funny hats and a big blond guy who gets depressed because so many girls want to make out with him.  The whole movie takes itself way too seriously and in the third act becomes a sort of murder mystery with Tom Hanks wandering the mean streets of New York city in a stupor believing himself to be a holy man with magic spells.  No really.  It either wants to be a cautionary tale about parents putting to much pressure on college students, or a cautionary tale about the dangers of role playing games, or a cautionary tale about buying a double bed without asking your girlfriend first.  This is ripe material for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment so if you can get some friends together and enough alcohol...game on!  (Also, the 1982 hair and fashions are great to see.

I miss the days when their criticism was more socially beneficial, but it's been over 150 years since the Abolitionists were active.  Since that high point, they've degenerated into either pointless or annoying, from the temperance movement, to fear of rock 'n' roll music, ""reefer"" (which reappeared as ""Just Say No""), Satanic ritual abuse at your local day care, and currently, hysteria over trans women using public toilets.

Starting in the late 1970s, the role-playing game ""Dungeons and Dragons"" managed to achieve a level of popularity far beyond the science fiction and fantasy community (role-playing games were nothing new to SF fans, who'd been playing them for years - Gary Gygax didn't come up with D & D out of nowhere).  D & D suddenly took off with the high school and college set, played in bedrooms and dorms all across America.  For a while, this became my friends' typical socialization - we'd play for hours in the evening and through the night to the wee hours of the morning, fueled on beer and junk food.  One acquaintance who never played with us sat in on one game, and observed that D & D appeared to be just something to do while we were getting drunk.  Certainly we were safer in the bedroom of the guy whose house we played at every time, than we would have been out on the street causing trouble.  Later, I moved to college and started taking other activities, like girls, more seriously.  I remember walking into a room once a few years later where some kids were playing D & D; by then, it was pathetic - as nerdy as dressing up in Star Trek uniforms and speaking Klingon.

Mazes and Monsters capitalized on the hysteria around ""what diabolical activities are the kids up to now?""  The film was loosely based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rona-Jaffe-novel/dp/0440055369/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rona Jaffe novel</a>&nbsp;of 1981, which fancifully attributed the death of Michigan State student James Dallas Egbert III to overzealous D & D play.  The Tom Hanks character's belief that he and his friends have become their D & D characters, trapping him in an endless ""game,"" recalls similar fears in the 1960s that hallucinogens like LSD would drive users insane by consigning them to a permanent ""trip.""

Of course, most of us survived these perils, as the current generation will survive the excessive time spent walking around outdoors and its associated increase in health caused by ""Pokemon Go.""  It's encouraging that no one has seen the need for a popular film warning of the dangers of transsexualism (""he started acting like a girl, and now he IS a girl!"").

Funny and sad in the same context as Reefer Madness, it's akin to a long after-school special in the blunt, inelegant way it hammers away at its only point. An extremely young Tom Hanks, freshly released from his run on Bosom Buddies, cut his teeth on more serious material in this leading role. As the poor sap who nosedives into deep mental illness as a direct result of the game, his part is madly corny and he clearly had some growing pains to work through before becoming the dramatic juggernaut we'd all come to know a decade later.

2416262,3,B000BGQUHA,"Mazes and Monsters was an attempt to demonize Dungeons and Dragons at the height of its cultural popularity.  Although I was alive at the time this movie came out, I was too young to know what kind of impact it had.  As it stands now, I would say this movie fails miserably in its mission.

Mazes and Monsters is based on the urban legend of a kid who died after supposedly playing Dungeons and Dragons in a sewer system.  Of course, that story was debunked long ago, shortly after it began making the rounds.  Tom Hanks (in his first movie role) plays a college kid with some kind of mental disorder who gets wrapped up in a role playing game with some friends and eventually loses his mind for good.

Instead of actually villifying Dungeons and Dragons, the producers of Mazes and Monsters somehow manage to not only NOT do that, but they also completely ignore and marginalize Tom Hanks' character's underlying mental issues.  I mean, seriously, when I watched this movie, I thought to myself, ""Man, if I had a friend or family member with a mental disorder, I would be really offended.""

I think the movie was attempting to portray role-playing games as one of the triggers of the mental problems, but it never explains why EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MOVIE WHO PLAYS THE GAME turns out a normal, well-adjusted, caring, compassionate student who gets good grades.

So yeah, it's worth watching at least once, especially if you're a Tom Hanks fan or a gamer of some kind, and also for its pop culture importance.",1358899200,2,1508,4.617977528089888

2416265,1,B000BGQUHA,"This movie is about a group of college kids playing mazes and monsters (*Cough* Dungeons and Dragons *cough*) and one of them starts to mix reality and fantasy and can't tell between the two. While this is pretty cool, there is some subpar acting and the movie did not age well. The story is semi-decent and kind of makes you want to know what's going to happen next, but also pulls you slowly along.

The one monster you see looks so fake, and the original wolf man looks more realistic than this thing. The outfits are just your normal look for an older movie like this, and the outfits they pick out for the characters they portray( the mazes characters) do look kind of cool. The maps, board, and little figures they use really remind you of Dungeons and dragons, which is cool to see it in a movie.

The setting the movie takes place varies between the school, and New York City. The dorms and school campus look like they should, but that would be a hard thing to mess up. The parts they film in New York are cool to see what they looked like years ago. On the other hand, its creepy and sad because you get to see inside the twin Towers, like the lobbies and stairs, with another part showing you what it looks like on the roof.

The sound effects don't really add anything to the movie, and the one song you keep hearing over isn't too bad, but they don't really add anything else besides that.

This movie has no special features to speak of, but they do allow you to select the scenes (woo...). I mean with older movies like the predator having special features being so old and all, I hoped this would have something.
Overall I say if you find this movie on sale or something, it would be worth it to just see the inside of the twin towers.

But regardless of its roots, Mazes and Monsters is a classic.  Tom Hanks stars in this fantastic story of a young college student obsessed with the fictional Mazes and Monsters RPG, and delivers one of his earliest and most memorable performances.  The production is low, but decent for a made-for-tv movie, and the cast and crew have a chemistry that works to create an atmosphere that leaves the audience on edge and dynamic character relationships that bring out some very intense personal moments.

It may be a paranoia film like the infamous Reefer Madness, but looking past its origins, it bears a stronger resemblance to The Dead Poets Society mixed with Pink Floyd's The Wall, than a cautionary exploitation film, and to lump it together with such 1930s and 40s trash is not only inaccurate but insulting to a fantastic drama thriller that is well worth adding to any collection.",1270857600,,1180,4.826732673267327

2416273,3,B000BGQUHA,"Okay, let's start off by making it clear that I'm a gamer.  I started playing D&D way back in 1980, and was very into it through junior high and high school. One of my earliest jobs was working at a game (not toy) store, and I have worked at several more game stores since then, including managing one.

When I first saw Mazes and Monsters (on TV), I was thrilled to see characters enjoying a role playing game (just as that brief D&D scene in E.T. made so many gamers happy).  I even bought a copy of the book - and enjoyed it - although Rona Jaffe isn't an author I'd generally read.

One thing that was clear to me in the book - and it was also fairly clear in the movie - is that the game was a red herring.  It wasn't the game that caused Robbie to lose his grip with reality, it was the way his family failed to deal with the disappearance of his older brother, and the emotional damage that this caused in an otherwise normal seeming teen.

In the book/movie, there is a great hubbub about Robbie getting lost in the caves, when he wasn't lost in the caves at all - just as the real life case that ""inspired"" this had everyone in a furor about the student getting lost in the steam tunnels, when he was actually not there, and D&D had nothing to do with his disappearance.  If anything, this illustrates how much the ""steam tunnels"" urban legend was based on hysteria and fear of the ""different"".  Having a movie - even a mediocre TV movie - about D&D (even if a fake name was used) is something that helped to bring mainstream awareness to role playing games, and thus probably helped to dispel more ignorance than any number of ""Chick Tracts"" can create.",1256515200,5,1663,4.273885350318471

2416278,3,B000BGQUHA,"This review contains some spoilers.

I've grown to become a Tom Hanks fan over the years.  This movie is one of his forgotten early films.

The premise of the film is that a group of young role-playing gamers become a bit *too* involved with a game called ""Mazes and Monsters,"" a blatant reference to Dungeons and Dragons.

Tom Hanks plays the boy that falls hard for the role-playing game and comes out psychotic and suicidal.  (One of the climatic scenes eerily takes place on the observation deck of the Twin Towers in New York city.)

The entire cast does a good job with their roles (hence the three stars), but ultimately the movie fails to deliver.

The most glaring problem is that the premise is not credible.

The film was clearly done in response to (actually as a way to exploit) the poor Michigan man that ended up as a suicide victim a year or so before the film was shot.  At the time, the media and some religious groups tried to put role-playing as the central reason for the suicide.  Good investigative work by folks like Mike Stackpole and organizations like the Game Manufacturers of America have gone a long way towards dispelling these kinds of wild ascertions, and today the film just seems like something akin to ""Reefer Madness.""

Robin Williams, Al Gore, Mike Myers, and even the royal British princes have all described their experiences with role-playing games.  It is hard to push the suspension of disbelief button when the central premise of the movie is that RPGs form an avenue to the darkest pits of the human soul and invite the players to become addicts and potentially commit suicide.  (Now, if the film has instead showed the kids playing hour after hour and eventually failing out of school then I would have to admit that that premise is credible.)

Overall, this film is probably worth a Netflix view, but probably is not worth it as an addition to your film library.",1204156800,13,1909,4.659701492537313

I remember all the media exposes about how D&D causes death, violence and destruction, and this movie just used that hysteria as the basis for the plot. Who could ever forget Tom Hanks standing near a ledge of the Twin Towers asking, ""What am I doing here?"" He probably looks back on this film and still asks that same question.

However, as a fan of all things that bring schlock to the level of high art, I loved this film. As a New Yorker, I adored the scene of Hanks running down 8th Avenue and passing a sidewalk sign for souvalaki for two bucks! Now THAT'S NOSTALGIA!",1190505600,,820,4.25
2416280,2,B000BGQUHA,"Before Tom Hanks joined Hollywood's A-list, the actor starred in a comedy series called ""Bosom Buddies"" on ABC and several forgettable made-for-tv dramas like this one, ""Mazes and Monsters"" created to capitalize on the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" hysteria and bad press the game received during the early 80's.  Despite a fairly good cast, mostly in cameo roles (Anne Francis, Murray Hamilton, Lloyd Bochner, Susan Strasberg) and Chris Makespeace (""My Bodyguard""), and a interesting premise about a college student who retreats into a fantasy world depicted by the game itself; his character ""Pardu,"" the vehicle of his quest for the ""Great Hall"" (subconscious guilt over his brother's death) and the ""Two Towers""--a ""quest"" that takes him from the bowels of NYC's subway system to the World Trade Center.

Adapted from the Rona Jaffe novel of the same name, the film has some good scenes, but tends to drag in the middle.  And the love interest between Hank's character and the female lead seems rather forced and artificial only to move the plodding storyline along. (After Hank's character leaves her for his ""quest,"" she immediately takes up with the other male member from this quartet of gameplayers.)

The movie serves no real purpose but to show, albeit negatively, that ""D & D"" players are nothing more than your brighter-than-average talented misfits that never ""fit in"" who dream and manufacture their own world of monsters, heroes, heroines, and far off places. The parents too are mere cardboard cutouts of the same tired cliche: Robbie's mother is an alcoholic, Jay-Jay's mother is a vapid interior decorator who changes his room every semester.  The ending of the film, however, was unexpected and helps dispel some of the bad reputation most, if not all, made-for-tv movies have earned over the years.  This transfer to DVD is rather poor and a very bad transfer overall.  I bought mine for $3.99 at Ross Dress for Less.

The most telling and effective scene occurs at the end of the film when Robbie's friends visit the protagonist at his home (apparently on leave from the university and recovering from a nervous breakdown); we think he is recovered and ready to join his friends back in school next semester, but alas, he only sees them as the fictional characters they portrayed on a gameboard--his idyllic backyard the setting for yet another adventure.

Hanks does his best given the limited material and script he had to work with (he had done pretty much only comedy at this point) but it's a solid reading that would provide this actor with a springboard to a distinguished acting career and several Academy Award winning performances to follow.",1183939200,3,2666,5.013574660633484
2416281,4,B000BGQUHA,"PLOT

The film begins with the excitement of a new college semester on the verge - Kate, Daniel, and Jay-Jay travel to school with their seemingly 'normal' stereotypical families'... then there's Robbie, a sensitive sort with an alcoholic mother and verbally abusive father, trying to align his priorities despite his past extreme distractions with a fantasy board game akin to ""Dungeons & Dragons"" called ""Mazes & Monsters"", when lo and behold, he spies an ""M&M"" group advertised on the posting board in the cafeteria... and it begins... the obsession resurfaces, progressing from a gloomy candlelit room to ""taking it to the next level"" wherein the players actually don the accoutrement of their characters {acquired from Theatre class} and travel to the local caverns where Jay-Jay, the resident ""Game Lord"" {eq. 'Dungeon Master'; D&D} has arranged several objects including a skeleton which appear on cue when the wayfarers pass through certain spots in the caves, whereupon the Game Lord's voice echoes forth with warnings and instructions. This is where the hallucinations begin for Robbie, imagining a literal ""Gorvil"" creature stalking the stalactite-laden corridors, which becomes the first indication of his mental degeneration.

He confides in his girlfriend Kate about the loss of his brother 'Hall' on Halloween to a mysterious dissappearence and was never found...

Thus, on Halloween night, while others were living it up, he sleeps and begins dreaming of a dark figure named ""The Great Hall"" who informs him of his erstwhile 'destiny' as 'Pardu' the Holy Man, who must seperate himself from the group, become {ack!} celebate {there went Kate...}, and seek 'The Towers' by engaging upon a quest, which takes Robbie to New York City where he roams in a hypnogogic state until an attempted mugging by a couple of greasy thugs results in him defending himself by stabbing one of the lowlifes, all the while perceiving himself as this 'Pardu', and the attacker as another Gorvil.

Frightened by this encounter, he almost comes to his senses and calls for help. Being skiddish however, seeing another couple of guys on a street corner scares him enough to descend into the city's subway system and further below into the labyrinthine underworld beneath the streets, and its roaring ""Great Dragon""...

Meanwhile, the Police become alerted to his sudden disappearence, and the group are payed a visit by an investigator. Scared that they may be implicated in his missing, his friends scramble to figure out where he may have gone by inspecting his room and find a hand-drawn map, carefully brainstorming to decipher his 'journey'.

Robbie eventually encounters a homeless man who jestingly refers to himself as 'The King of France' - of course, being in a completely delusional state of mind, ""Pardu"" acknowledges him as such, inquiring for directions to 'The Towers'*, which turns out being 'The Twin Towers', The World Trade Center, to be exact, which one could see coming from a mile away, as it were, both figuratively and literally. Included is some extensive interior footage of the WTC from lobby to observation deck.

His friends eventually catch up to him as he climbs out on the parapet preparing to join with ""The Great Hall"", until tearfully awakening from the somnambulism. He is eventually committed to a scenic mental home where his delusions persist, and after one last 'adventure' with friends, is left to live out his days in his fantasy world.

ANALYSIS

Obviously, Robbie dealt with the loss of his big brother by anthropomorphosizing his memory as ""The Great Hall"", and his desire to reunite with him. Delving into the board game as a form of escapism taken to an extreme, in this case served as an affectation of his mental illness, but may not necessarily have been the cause of it, but merely placed fantastical definitions and terminology to establish an albeit false identity.

Through a balanced perspective, these games can be an amusing recreational activity, but there may always be the danger of those with a wayward brain who will literalize elements therein and attempt to detrimentally personafy either the characters and/or activities described. While the exercise of the imagination is encouraged and channelled into creative endeavors, care must sometimes be taken with the mentally ill in order to prevent compulsion, lest you travel the ""Pardu Path"" to insanity.

This movie means a lot to me because I grew up in that time when D&D first came out. Not having anyone close to me get that 'confused' but there were tales of kids poking out their eyes and replace them with 'magic buttons' and so forth.",1179532800,,474,4.1521739130434785
2416283,2,B000BGQUHA,"On August 15, 1979, a troubled child prodigy named James Egbert slipped into the steam tunnels beneath Michigan State University with a pocket full of 'ludes. And lo, an urban legend was born. You see, James had occasionally played Dungeons & Dragons some time before enrolling at Michigan, and his oblivious parents along with a news media hungry for scandal latched on to the idea that the fantasy world of role playing had driven him to suicide. The reality was Egbert wasn't dead, or even lost in the tunnels, but hiding at various locations in fear of his folks. The truth rarely matters in such circumstances, though, does it? Soon word of other suicides by teenagers who played D&D began popping up like dandelions in April, and a new hysteria had gripped America. Anti-gaming advocacy groups were formed. Chick tracts were published. The makers of the game even began to change some of their manuals to avoid controversy.  And just before the madness peaked (around 1983), Rona Jaffe published a  fictionalized warning of the sinister power of RPGs, ""Mazes and Monsters"", based loosely on James Egbert's story. This film was a television movie adapted from the novel, and is notable today mostly for starring a young Tom Hanks.

Now, before I get started, I'm not a gamer. I've never played an RPG in my life to be honest. However, I know how the 'fear and consumption' media works and a little bit of digging will turn up studies that prove the suicide rate among gamers is lower than the national average. And anything reguritated by the Falwell crowd is automatically suspect to begin with, right? This isn't the usual ""incredibly strange film"" that occupies my late nights. But when you spend money on a movie, even a few bucks, even if it was a year or two ago, don't you kinda feel obligated to watch it if for nothing else than to justify that you got something, anything, for that wasted cash? Ditto, amigo.

905 Studios is the party responsible for ""Mazes and Monsters"" DVD debut. This disc doesn't give me much hope for the quality of ""Death Wish Club"", a truly strange film that 905 is allegedly releasing soon. There are no extras, and the transfer isn't very good. ""M&M"" centers around four university students who decide to play a live action game in the caverns around their school. During one of these sessions, Hanks character goes nuts. ""Bardu"" dreams that his long lost brother is calling him to Manhattan, so he breaks up with his girlfriend (he's a cleric, after all!) and takes off. Well, everyone thinks he's missing in the caverns, and his fellow gamers lie to the police so they won't be expelled. Finally, Hanks snaps out of it for a moment after knifing a mugger, and the gang comes to get him. The final scenes show ""Bardu"" hopelessly and forever immersed in his character as the heartbroken friends decide to play one last campaign with him on his folks estate.

As propaganda, ""Mazes and Monsters"" fails on every level. It's not even that entertaining as kitsch like ""Reefer Madness"" or ""Safety Belt For Susie"". Lord knows that theme song gives Debbie Boone some competition in the ghastly department. Maybe someone who games and was a wee tyke (like me) during the time it was made might find it amusing as a time capsule of an era they were too young to remember. I tend to doubt it has much replay value even then. A much better purchase for you wizards and paladins out there (and even us boring folks who don't game or read comics ;) is the 5-disc set of the D&D toon that ran on CBS. Not only is that series entertaining, but BCI threw in the kitchen sink as far as extras. There's even a D&D compatable manual included. As for 905, let's hope a truly DVD worthy piece of junk like ""Death Wish Club"" gets the justice it deserves. I'm not expecting Criterion quality, but c'mon guys, you can do much better than this.",1168387200,18,3860,4.645680819912152
2416284,2,B000BGQUHA,"So what does this movie mean . . . twenty years later?

First of all, the footage inside and outside the World Trade Center is worth the cost of DVD, for historical and sentimental reasons.  My memories of the WTC are limited to the King Kong remake, one episode of the Simpsons (wisely taken out of syndication so as not to hurt our feelings--LOL), and flying over the Twin Towers on my way to Portugal.  So I saw them as most of humanity will see them--from a distance and on old films.

In a second sense, this film is a must for a Tom Hans devotee.  It has one of Hanks's earliest non-""Bosom Buddies"" performances.  And you can see what the director saw.  Hanks, despite his callowness, still stands out among the rest of the Unknowns in the film.  He gives an A- performance in this midgrade B movie. Of course the script stinks, but it was a vehicle for Hanks, and suggests the much better things that were to come.  So you can enjoy it on that level.

So about the dragons . . .

I confess that I was a pseudo-gamer, and when this first aired, I caught only the first three minutes before switching it off.  Even at that young age, I was tired  of the Grown-Ups criticizing a game they had never played, nor have understood.  They were just repeating things that other people had told them.  And they would not admit it.  So this film was basically a Scared Strait film, based on hearsay, exaggeration, and a hasty generalization from one incident from Michigan State in 1979.

Time's irony is that both adults and Christian fundamentalists have embraced fantasy.  You know that men who criticized D&D in the 1980's had wives in the 1990's who devoured the Harry Potter books and films.  And many Christians have embraced Tolkien's and C. S. Lewis's Christianity that was all along embedded in their fantasy.

Of his own work, Tolkien said, ""The Gospels contain a fairystory, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. They contain many marvels-- peculiarly artistic, beautiful, and moving: ""mythical"" in their perfect, self contained

significance; and among the marvels is the greatest and most complete conceivable eucatastrophe. But this story has entered History and the primary world; the desire and aspiration of sub-creation has been raised to the fulfillment of Creation. The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. The Resurrection is the eucatastrophe of the story of the Incarnation. This story begins and ends in joy."" (The Tolkien Reader, 88-89).

Role-playing games were a way to tap into this joy.  The film illustrated what the hystericals ignored: the reason why people got involved in war-games and fantasy was that their real world. In the film, all the weird students had even weirder parents--controlling, pushy, and therefore evil.  By entering the sub-created fantasy world, it provided a realm where they could experience control.

For young adults, and definitely for college students, this control is an essential part of development.  That is why children's games--dress-up, playing house or soldier or Batman--are all important for later development. At some point, you really have to play house, soldier, or really play Batman.

This is not quote-unquote escapism.  Tolkien keenly observed that the ""class of men . .  . you expect to be most preoccupied with, and most hostile to, the idea of escape"" are in fact the ""jailers."" (Lewis, On Stories, 63; cf. Tolkien Reader, 79ff).

Of course there is a general message here about addictions, with D&D being a mere vehicle.  War-games can be addictive, but so can video-games, shopping, or drugs.  In this sense, M&M is like ""Reefer Madness,"" since they both warn about a real, potential danger.

The ending of this film is a bit disappointing, and that is where the film falls down.  The message is that D&D is so bad, if you play it, you are irredeemably doomed.  This is silly propaganda, and it was preaching to the choir for the faithful, or a backfire to people like me.

This brings us back to the World Trade Center.  We need to have a proper scale of dangers and valuations.

I won't lie, most people probably won't care much for this movie, but, if you love RPGs (D&D) or really like Tom Hanks movies-- give it a shot. And if your not sure either way but find it cheap -- grab it and give it a try. It's one of those movies you have to be in the right mood to watch.

8086496,3,B000BGQUHA,Reefer Madness for D&D.  This movie reeks of people that think it will lead you to the devil and destroy your life with out having ever seen a session played.  The off scenes of the kids playing D&D in Stranger Things is much more realistic.  This show is unintentionally full of laughs with things like candle lit cult-like game sessions and hinted family problems like the mom being drunk by 10 am because she cant stand her husband.  It received 3 stars because it got so bad that it starts to become funny.  You have a much better time if you meta this and laugh at the people making this flick and their ideas on gaming than you do taking this movie at face value.,1518566400,,669,4.32

8086502,4,B000BGQUHA,"Interesting, how everyone seems to misunderstand the premise behind this movie.. the propaganda about Dungeons and Dragons is not the source of the story. The source of the story is about a young man, who, when suffering from schizophrenia, becomes engrossed in a persona of a character he created in the game. He has a psychotic episode, and remains stuck in that alternate world. It's not about the dangers of playing dice board games, though at the time it was made, people probably didn't have a grasp on what schizophrenia was. It's a testimony about what happens when a person who is mentally unstable can be affected badly if not treated.

It wasn't a bad movie. I mean... I just watched it, and it's dated, but tom still acts pretty awesome considering the movie and dialogue were not very good.",1512172800,2,803,4.735714285714286
