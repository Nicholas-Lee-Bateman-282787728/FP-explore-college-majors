7959822,5,B000063UQZ,"Cardcaptor Sakura, Vol. 8: Sweet Trouble contains four episodes.  The last one is a comedy classic.  It had me laughing out loud a lot!

Sakura's Sweet Cooking - Why Clow Reed invented the ""sweet"" card, which only makes things sickeningly sweet tasting, is beyond me and doesn't jive with the rest of the series.  This episode is pretty slow, and has the kids making cakes in home ec class.

Sakura and the Injured Card - Very touching and anyone with a love for animals will have a lump in their throat.  One of the serie's finest episodes.  Sakura's classmate finds the wounded ""Dash"" card and adopts the cat-like animal as a pet.  The girl is so happy that Sakura is hesitant to capture the card.  But when the card repays it's master by giving her special powers, Sakura must decide to act.

Sakura and the Nameless Book - Another girl finds a book in a book store with a write-your-own-ending, quill pen included.  She stays up late, conjuring flying animals, some cute, some not-so-cute.  Sakura and her friends take the fight to the night with an homage to Godzilla movies.

Sakura, Kero, and Shaoran - So, so, so funny.  In capturing the chamelon-like ""Change"" card, Li and Kero switch bodies!  They canot re-switch until the following evening.  At school, neither can lie low as the promised, which results in some crazy antics.",1116547200,5,1337,4.698275862068965
7959823,5,B000063UQZ,"These episodes bounce around a lot in terms of their theme and topic.  Not surprisingly, Sakura needs her friends and they need her as she tries to capture more cards.  The consciousness switching with Kero and Shaoran was very very funny but also revealed some of their own unique problems and strengths.  Maybe they'll learn to get along a bit better.",1076630400,2,353,4.754098360655738
7959824,5,B000063UQZ,"For Volume 8, we get 5 cards for the price of 4!
First up, an un-dubbed ep.  Sakura and her class are making cakes in Home Ec., only the Sweet card is trying to help...a little too much. And Kero-Chan's definition of ""harmless"" needs tuning! (The durn thing turned a chalk board into CHOCOLATE! I don't think I wanna know what it could do to something alive!)
Next, one that did make the dub, the capture of the Dash card. This one is worth it for the bits that got cut from it. Also, though Li gets this card, it isn't because he earned it, it's because Sakura lost it.
Third up, it's two, two, two cards in one! First, Sakura and friends find the Big card turning creatures and plants in a local commerce area gigantic! But this pales to the fact that Sakura's friend Naoko has gotten hold of the Create card...a book which turns anything written in it into reality...even dragons! Though it was dubbed, this episode is worth it, especially for the edited commentary of Sakura wanting to become giant so she can stomp on Toya, and then later realizing that with Big, she can do just that!(Much to Toya's confusion.)
To wrap up, we have one more which made the dub, the capture of the chameleon-like Change card, which switches Li and Kero's bodies. This one is WAY worth it, as the original Japenese only switched the boys' accents, not their voices, and the original ending is SO much more fun than the dubs!
Well, see you in Volume 9!

7959825,5,B000063UQZ,"We're up to volume 8, which is presented in a lovely yellow cover featuring Sakura in her ""big"" outfit from episode 31, while gazing off to the left. Standard postcard and what not.
The first season is slowly winding down with only one more volume left. The first season does not stand on it's own for the second season ends the clow card catching. The division is to put some emphasis on the plot twist that is to come.
Featuring 4 cute episodes!!!
**The class is doing their best to cook, but a relatively strange card is spoiling their fun. The Sweet card is making everything taste sweet???? What's up with that?
**Sakura's classmate Rei is determined to make it to the big track and field competition. She is also housing an injured Clow card that is ultimately making her run faster. Sakura doesn't have the heart to take away her luck charm, but Shaoran does...
**Sakura and Li battle to capture a Clow card that is causeing a ""large"" problem, but while focusing on the Big card, another more dangerous card has fallen in the arms of Naoko, major phenomenon specialist. Weird animals appear from no where and a fantasy novel that Naoko writes in the pages of Create comes to life, dragon and all!!!!
**With the help of Shaoran and Kero, Sakura manages to seal the Change card, but with consequences. Their souls have been switched. Shaoran undergos an adventure from a smaller perspective while Kero makes a spectacle of himself in Shaoran's image. Will this day ever end before someone finds out the truth?
Only one more disc and we get a new Opening and Ending. See you in May! Release!!!!!!",1015459200,21,1600,4.637323943661972
