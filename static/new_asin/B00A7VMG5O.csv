If you are into training films, you need this one.",1360713600,6,131,4.076923076923077
5395830,5,B00A7VMG5O,"Buck Brannaman is an astonishing trainer.  Watching these clinics has helped expand my understanding of my horses and their interaction with me.  There is an enormous amount of information in this series.  It is not always edited as you would expect but I realize it is put together from footage used for the movie ""Buck"", so I allowed for that when watching.  Some of what is taught seems contradicted by what you see, ie: equipment choices.  I am lucky to have a resource who is very familiar with Buck's training approach to get answers about those things that puzzled me.  The series would be improved if more information in that regard was provided.  There is no close captioning for Buck's dialog.  Buck breaks down his lessons and shows you what can be achieved.  Overall, it is an excellent resource for anyone who has horses and is well worth the price.",1359504000,2,862,4.693333333333333
5395831,5,B00A7VMG5O,I have 2 horses and this is the BEST! It's such a great natural horsemanship way to train your horses!! I would recommend this for everyone as it is a cruelty free way of training your horses! Buck is the best!,1358294400,7,210,4.146341463414634
5395832,5,B00A7VMG5O,"You don't have to be an advanced rider to benefit from this clinic series featuring Buck Brannaman. However, it probably does help if you're at least a serious student of horsemanship...if only to understand the importance of the endless 'wax on, wax off' moments Sensei Brannaman ;-) delivers along the way. Cindy Meehl and her production team followed Buck to 7 clinics to capture 'footage' for the documentary, Buck. Cindy then cut the best from each clinic and arranged the content by topic. In particular, thank you for this arrangement, Cindy (should you ever read this). The video itself is high quality, with great audio (production quality like this is a rarity unto itself in the world of instructional horsemanship DVDs). In my opinion, this is worth every penny.",1357862400,23,774,5.007751937984496
5395833,4,B00A7VMG5O,"I thought the parts that I have seen so far are interesting. At times it was hard to follow exactly what he was expecting you to do but, I was able to figure it out. I've only watched the first 2 DVDs.
All in all it's a good video to get you more connected with your horse.",1357776000,,273,3.807017543859649
5395834,5,B00A7VMG5O,The videos have a lot of good information. I especially learned a lot from the ground work portions. Looking forward to some warmer weather to apply some of these techniques to my own horses.,1357689600,,191,4.647058823529412
5395835,5,B00A7VMG5O,Buck in person is unbelievable - but to get me through the winter in anticipation of the upcoming clinics - this is great!,1357084800,,122,4.3478260869565215
5395836,3,B00A7VMG5O,"First I would like to say that I have read books by Buck and found them to be a great learning tool which is why I couldn't wait to order this set. However, that being said I was disappointed. For the price and being a new rider I don't think these are worth the cost and found them harder to follow than other dvd's that are available. Perhaps this would be a good choice if you were involved in one of his clinics and wanted to review for things that might have been missed or as a refresher to his class.",1356480000,8,507,4.02970297029703
5395837,5,B00A7VMG5O,I bought this after auditing a 3-day clinic. Really helpful for reviewing everything I learned and for picking up some information that I missed. Well worth the investment.,1355961600,,172,5.178571428571429
5395838,5,B00A7VMG5O,My boyfriend trains using these methods. He has watched each of these DVDs multiple times (and has audited a clinic with Buck--everything he teaches is in these videos). Great resource for someone wanting to learn more about his methods.,1494288000,,237,5.102564102564102

5395842,2,B00A7VMG5O,"I read both of Buck's books and found them goods reads and more than worth their value and they made me want to learn more about how Buck teaches and his methods to use on my horses. Both my wife and myself were disappointed by this tape set. I'm glad we rented then from giddyupfix and did not purchase them. I was looking for Bucks methodology, the methods he used,Ii guess more of an instructional set to compare to Clinton Anderson U-Tube videos and DVD's since there is very little on U-Tube or on the internet unlike some of the others. This tape set is not it, not even close. I like Buck as a trainer and I was wanting to confirm that he was the right person for us. I thought these tapes were going to be more of an instructional video and not just Snippets of the cutting room floor tape that did not make the film ""Buck"". I gave it a 2 star mostly because of not meeting my expectations. If you want to see a series of random clips from buck's clinics that unless you are familiar with his methods you can not follow or make sense of, or you have been to his clinics and want something for your Buck library, then this may be just right for you.",1480032000,,1156,4.165178571428571
5395843,3,B00A7VMG5O,"I really like Buck and the work he does. I am a believer in his methods. I am not happy with these videos however. They are not what I thought I was getting for the money. These videos are a collection of short videos taken by random people at his clinics. They do not really follow a lesson plan and jump around. They are not like some of the other videos I have watched.
I will watch them a few more times and still use what I can out of them. I think Buck has allot to offer and I hope to pick some of that up from these.",1477958400,2,524,3.81651376146789

5395850,3,B00A7VMG5O,"I love buck as a trainer, however I was a little disappointed in this video series as I thought it was going to be more of an instructional video and not just Snippets of the cuts that did not make the film. It leaves me wanting for more details and extended teaching. I am also very disappointed that the movies will not play on any of our older DVD players we've tried them in  several different players and they only work in the new DVD / Bluetooth player that we have.",1461542400,7,472,4.186813186813187

5395854,5,B00A7VMG5O,"There might be a whole lot of 'horse whisperers' out there, but I just love the Buck talks.  Even when he's correcting one of his students, he makes you wish you'd done something wrong, but it's such a positive thing.  I first watched Buck the movie(3 times), and then I got my first horse, so where else would I look for more insight into how a horse thinks?

In these 7 clinics, in three CDs, you get more of Buck's wisdom, and you get to see what it's like to take one of his classes(I plan on doing so someday).  Buck has such a natural way with horses and people.  When he was talking about the correct form when riding, he explained that if the rider didn't do it right, he'd end up a yard dart.  Having been pitched over the neck of my horse because of my incorrect position, I had to laugh.

I had no idea what 'ground work' meant, other than it meant you weren't on the horse.  Now my horse is older, and trained within an inch of his life, so the only one making mistakes on the ground, is me. Thankfully my horse has a sense of humor and is ver forgiving, but after watching this video, I can see how you can get into trouble fast if you don't know the correct way to make your horse circle you(disengaging the hindquarters is a must).

I bought this video set because the masseuse(yes my horse gets massages) who takes care of my horse said that she was asking for the set for Christmas.  I started out petrified of all horses, and mine is 17 hands high, so I was really afraid of him.  Buck promised to take away my fear of all horses, and he's really helped.  Knowledge kills fear and so far so good. I know so much more about horses, and I'm learning the language of horses, both what they are trying to say, and what my trainer is trying to tell me.

I'm sure there are lots of courses on video to learn about horses, but for me, I love Buck.  I love his humor, gentleness and love of these magnificent animals and his desire to help us all treat them better as we understand them better.",1453075200,12,2004,4.171428571428572

There is a ton of information throughout this whole set! This isn't a method like anderson or parrelli. It's true horsemanship through feel, balance and timing if you pay attention to the details!",1444435200,,368,4.676923076923077
5395860,3,B00A7VMG5O,"I had to return this before I watched it.  This is a 7 disc series.  I did not get disc 1/2, I got 3/4, and 2 copies of 4/5/6.  And when I tried to preview 4/5/6, not any of the 6 discs worked.  I returned and am waiting (tomorrow) for the new set.

UPDATE: New set came.  Although I loved the watching the videos, this is not a step by step learning program.  It is highlights from his classes.  Yes, you can find things to improve on, but most of this ""is in process"" and not from the beginning.  I would not buy this again, I would buy the individual ""lesson"" videos that Buck sells.  But, now that I paid $145, the rest will have to wait till I save more pennies.",1442188800,4,667,3.984848484848485

It is not a cookie cutter approach.  It was filmed at actual training exhibitions which gives one an interesting perspective watching the many people attending.

5395876,5,B00A7VMG5O,"I think it's one of the best collections of information on horsemanship you'll find in a dvd set. Although there is a lot to be gained from it, I do find this piece together from the documentary footage leaves some things out. Some of his earlier DVDs are more straight forward in teaching. This one should require you to have to rewatch several times taking notes along the way.

It's GREAT as a reference or for someone wanting to get an idea of how Buck teaches at his clinics.

His level of respect for the horse is exemplary.  And his explanations on why we have to really work on our sensibilities of getting the right feel and work at getting the timing down in terms of relesing the pressure make a lasting impression.

Other more talky bits, I know I will likely FF past. I recommend this set for riders seriously interested in the many small but essential details of horsemanship.

The best part is that, watching him, I got a better sense of his soft hands but split-second timing. Acquiring that kind of skilled combo is another matter to try to pick up by watching.

Buck just simply talks about the horse, how it is reacting to you, and mainly what YOU are doing that is wrong.
If you are thin skinned, not used to the words, damn or hell, then don't watch this. This is a cowboy who has an innate skill with horses, he is NOT a motivational speaker.
In the video, Buck is very hard on people if they are mistreating their horse.

As a precursor / primer, I would highly recommend that you watch Buck Brannaman's ""Groundwork"" DVD before you watch Discs 1 & 2 as it will give you the framework and understanding of Buck's approach and methods. Similarly, one would benefit from watching his ""Making of a Bridle Horse"" before watching discs 3 & 4. This is just because this set of 7 DVDs are not really a stand-alone, how-to kind of series. It is extremely valuable and informative, but it might not be ""instructional"" enough for everyone without the more in-depth coaching of his instructional DVDs.

If you love horses and want to far better your comprehension of them and the relationship you have with them this DVD set is an absolute must.  From groundwork through your knowledge can only improve.

This set is a must for every horse enthusiast, be it beginner or someone who is already on the wonderful journey, either a rider or not.

The DVDs are really easy to watch, they cover a range of tasks and the set does not appear to be designed to leave the viewer asking a huge range of questions.  There is a lot of food for thought and a smorgasbord of information which is comprehensive and very motivational if you have found that you are encountering the sticky places in your horsemanship journey.  Oftentimes,  it is not until you are aware of the exact question that you are seeking an answer for that you can actually ask the question.

This set covers a vast range of exercises from groundwork through and including riding, and just having those 'missing' steps shown, (which I was unaware were missing), gave me the answer to what I was personally having a couple of issues with with my horse human relationship.

Overall definately worth the money.  As a dressage rider I found much of the info extreamly useful.  I have had great results with removing the wrinkles at the corner of the bit, release after effective movements and letting the horse contemplate what she has learned, getting a good response to requests.  If more dressage riders used his basic tenants we would have a lot more happy horses.  The only downside is that some of the ""dressage questions"" in the videos are incorrect.  For example a good rider can turn her dressage horse with knee pressure on the outside fore, there is no need to put the outside leg back and I would consider this confusing to the horse..... In this way dressage riders can also steer the horse without any pressure on the reigns. But overall a great set of Videos.

5395925,5,B00A7VMG5O,"This set of DVD's is the single best source of horsemanship wisdom and practice that you will ever find.  Both the audio and video are superb.  It is the best $145 dollars that you will ever spend on your horse.  Among many other things, Buck offers some important things to do with your horse that will eliminate 95% of the bronc rides that you might have in your future.  And this may actually save your life.  So, I would say that this is money well spent.

At the beginning of every DVD, Buck speaks informally, for a few minutes, about the general philosophy that informs his approach to horses.  In the ""Lessons"" section of each DVD he covers everything from ground work, to basic exercises horseback, to more advanced and subtle concepts that will help both you and your horse to achieve a clear, harmonious communication based upon mutual trust and respect.  Everything he does with a horse is designed to set the horse up for success with a minimum of both mental and physical pressure.  I also appreciate seeing Buck work with other people's horses and addressing the problems that they have.  And since this is filmed in actual clinic settings, you will see a lot of people struggling with the same things that you might struggle with, and see them making the same mistakes that you are likely to make yourself.  I know that I recognize myself in some of his students!

There are no gimmicks here.  This is not about training your horse to do tricks.  In fact, this isn't about training your horse.  In my opinion, these DVD's are about educating you and me, the human beings in the dancing partnership, to communicate clearly, effectively and consistently with the horse in a way that maintains the dignity of the horse.  It emphasizes the importance of lightness in your approach -- everything from your mental frame of mind to the actions that you might perform with your horse.  And every single thing that Buck does with a horse on the ground has a direct correlation to what you will be doing once you are in the saddle.

If you are interested in creating a respectful, harmonious and positive relationship with your horse, this is the set of DVDs that you will want to watch.  And then watch again and again to pick up on the subtleties that you might have missed the first time.

(If you think about it, we are so fortunate to be living at a time in history when it is possible to glean the insights of a master horseman that has taken him a lifetime of trial, error, blood, sweat and tears to learn.  Just 20 to 30 years ago, it would have been almost impossible to get such excellent instruction and insight to such a large audience of horse owners.  So, I would recommend that you take advantage of this opportunity.  Not all horsemen, or anybody who is truly a master at what they do, are willing to share what it has taken them a lifetime to learn).",1364342400,49,2873,4.525193798449612
