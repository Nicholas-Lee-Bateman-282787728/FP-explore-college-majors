8574115,5,B00BUKFIGA,"Misora Hibari's 35th anniversary concert is Misora at her glorious best! It is easy to see why she is still called Japan's greatest female artist of all time... more than 20 years after her untimely death. It is apparent that young and old adored her... and although I do not understand Japanese, her spirit and energy capture my heart and imagination. Amazing concert... amazing performer!",1380844800,,390,5.015384615384615
