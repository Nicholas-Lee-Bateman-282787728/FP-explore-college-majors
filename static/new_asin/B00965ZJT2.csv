5272575,5,B00965ZJT2,"I really wish they had been able to continue this series, it is absolutely priceless. Some people will hate it (my husband) but I loved it and couldn't wait to buy the DVD. It is so realistic and SO funny. I actually started reading the newspapers to see what would happen next in London because of what I was seeing when watching Twenty twelve, and as I read the paper it was as if it was a satire piece about the Olympics! Twisted my mind in a great way.",1359417600,3,456,4.134831460674158
5272576,5,B00965ZJT2,"It's a shame this didn't make it to the US, because this is one of the funniest series I've even seen.  I'd highly recommend!",1358208000,5,125,4.208333333333333
5272577,5,B00965ZJT2,"If you like all things British, you'll love this mockumentary with its understated humour and interactions.  Great characters and actors.",1483142400,,137,5.85
5272578,5,B00965ZJT2,Wife and I both really enjoyed this series.  Funny and with great characters.,1477958400,,77,4.923076923076923
5272579,5,B00965ZJT2,"We love it! (We are fans of Hugh Bonneville and not corporate stupidity, so we are biased). wish this or W1a had a few more episodes",1470096000,,132,4.115384615384615
5272580,5,B00965ZJT2,"This is so funny and is ""brilliant"" at capturing the British character.  Reminds me of ""Yes, Minister"" & ""Yes, Prime Minister"".",1468454400,,127,5.0476190476190474
5272581,5,B00965ZJT2,"This was an hilariously funny--if slightly dated--program.  The cast was superb, perfectly on point in portraying the archetypes one encounters in any current-day bureaucracy.  Very, very funny and marvelous entertainment",1462406400,,221,6.333333333333333
5272582,5,B00965ZJT2,"Very clever, great acting, amazing characters. The followup series W1A is better but it's built on the characters portrayed here. If you want a good laugh that can be watched over and over to find all the intricacies, pick up this series.",1461715200,,238,4.690476190476191
5272583,5,B00965ZJT2,"A dry British gem, enjoy.",1455926400,,25,4.2
5272584,5,B00965ZJT2,"Great fun. If you like W1A, this is more of the same, fine, not-so-much-a-parody of bureaucracy. A modern Yes Minister.",1453248000,,119,5.0
5272585,5,B00965ZJT2,Fantastic precursor to WI2,1445212800,,26,5.75
5272586,5,B00965ZJT2,"VERY FUNNY - I enjoyed this idiotic farce that puts Olympic Games committees in total perspective. Only the British can mock them selves with such a ""serious face"". This demands a sequel and a prequel.",1439078400,,201,4.771428571428571
5272587,4,B00965ZJT2,"This series is so well done.  Wry, understated humor.  Excellent cast.  I laughed throughout.
However, the DVD was flawed.  It did not complete the series, giving fractured pictures of the last three, which made them unwatchable.  I was able to find a friend who had the series so that I could view these last three episodes.  Had the DVD been better, I would rate this as a 5-star.",1438646400,,382,4.544117647058823
5272588,1,B00965ZJT2,We love Hugh Bonneville's acting. but we couldn't sit and watch this. It was a waste of time.,1429142400,,93,4.222222222222222
5272589,5,B00965ZJT2,"Absolutely marvellous!!  Don't think that these 6+ hours of the 2010 and 2012 BBC series have passed their sell- by date or only apply to the Olympics just because the topical event has come and gone.  And, don't worry that a lack of familiarity with British personalities or accents will prevent enjoyment;  although it does help to know a bit about Boris Johnson and his schemes as London mayor.  This is one of the best satires ever - in the champions league with Yes, Minister.  I laughed and giggled the first time around;  watched it the next night and laughed again.  A few days later, after an encounter with some people like these, watched it a third time and laughed even more.  This is now one of my favourite frustration remedies.",1426204800,2,742,4.6106870229007635
5272590,5,B00965ZJT2,I sent this as a gift.  I had seen it on BBC America when it originally aired.  If you like clever British comedies then you will truly enjoy this,1422316800,,146,4.0
5272591,5,B00965ZJT2,Too funny and VERY British.,1419984000,,27,4.6
5272592,5,B00965ZJT2,All by myself I am laughing out loud!,1415404800,,37,3.75
5272593,5,B00965ZJT2,"If you're a fan of Chris Guest-style mockumentaries, or the Brit mockumentary series ""People Like Us"", this is another very funny and clever mockumentary mini-series that aired just before the 2012 Olympics in London, since the premise of the show follows a very disorganized and inept Olympic-planning committee in London that's trying to get the city ready in time for the games; and of course they encounter all kinds of bureaucratic obstacles along the way-- traffic nightmares, PR gaffs, competing middle-management egos, etc.  This was done by the same guy who also did ""People Like Us"", so it's got the same kind of vibe-- clever, funny writing and quirky characters who are charmingly inept.  The 2012 Olympics may be long over, but this is still a mini-series worth watching-- and if you're a fan of Downton Abbey, you also get a chance to see Hugh Bonneville (Lord Grantham himself) be very endearingly funny as the head of this inept Olympic planning committee (and there's a charmingly sweet little subplot involving his secretary who has a crush on his character that makes it worth watching to the end as well!), so that's a big plus for it as well!  Highly recommended for Brit tv anglophiles! :)",1412380800,4,1211,4.897560975609756
5272594,5,B00965ZJT2,We saw the series on tv and adored it.  this is such a funny send up of people trying to look efficient when they are in over their heads.  Nice to see Hugh Bonneville being someone other than Lord Grantham.  We laughed out loud.  A Lot.,1411948800,,237,4.086956521739131
5272595,5,B00965ZJT2,"Hilarious.  Replete with idiotic politically correct doublespeak, bureaucratic bungling and asinine characters as only the British can do.  I laughed myself silly.  Worthy of watching more than once.",1410480000,,199,6.035714285714286
5272596,5,B00965ZJT2,"I learned of Twenty Twelve when it was recently broadcast on a PBS station in the Washington, DC area, and I was enthralled.  This mocumentary/comedy series is nothing short of hilarious.  Hugh Bonneville (of Downton Abbey fame) and Jessica Hynes are superb, as are all the cast members.  The various accents of some of the cast members and their quick quips and deliveries are a little difficult sometimes, even for American ears who have visited Great Britain frequently, but re-watching the episodes reveals hilarity that may have whizzed past on first hearing and is well worth the time.  One also suspects that there is more than a little truth in this story of the organizing of the London 2012 Olympics that applies to many other massive planned events as well.  What a pity there is only one season of it.  British comedy's reputation as the best in the world is well deserved, and Twenty Twelve is the best of the best.",1405814400,4,928,4.732919254658385
5272597,5,B00965ZJT2,"I first saw this a couple years ago and am buying the DVDs for an American friend who wants to see it - it is like The Office but with bumbling Government officials and staff in charge of organising the London Olympics.  Painfully funny and brilliantly cringey, it stars Hugh Bonneville (now of Downton Abbey fame) and lots of well-known UK actors.  Actual Olympic athletes & officials like Seb Coe do cameos which give it that added veneer of reality - so so funny!",1396569600,4,466,4.535714285714286
5272598,5,B00965ZJT2,"Clever writing, excellent acting and a topical subject - wonder if the Russians had similar problems -  made this series a total laugh out loud, as well as snicker at the subtle humor the British do so well. You may think of it as a current and encapsulated comedy of manners about our approach to business, meetings, political correctness, passive-aggressive territorial protection. You will likely see your boss, your mate, your best friend and yourself among the characters.",1390867200,3,477,5.115384615384615
5272599,5,B00965ZJT2,This too-short series is packed full of the driest of dry British humor. You can't go wrong with viewing this. I loved it!,1389657600,3,122,4.3478260869565215
5272600,5,B00965ZJT2,"hysterical.  If you like the American TV ""The Office"", you'll enjoy.  gringe comedy.  Engish relatives said it mirrored real Olympic problems.",1384300800,,142,5.666666666666667
5272601,5,B00965ZJT2,"If you missed this series on BBC America, you need to get the DVDs!  As leader of the team responsible for making the 2012 London Olympics happen on time and on budget, Hugh Bonneville (Downtown Abbey) tries to manage a strange semi-competent group while keeping the Olympics moving and his masters and the press satisfied.  A master of corporate doublespeak, Bonneville's Ian Fletcher tries to deal with a failing marriage as well his work.  Jessica Hynes as Siobhan Sharpe is always good for laughs as the PR lead who's all about style, but has little time for substance.

If you like British comedy and you've ever experienced the craziness of corporate culture, this series if for you.",1373414400,6,689,4.863247863247863
5272602,3,B00965ZJT2,This is a zany comedy but not sure it would appeal to everyone.  I use ear phones so British dialogue easier to understand.,1373414400,,123,4.3478260869565215
5272603,5,B00965ZJT2,"This show is very funny.  The characters were wonderfully created.  If you've ever sat through an inane business meeting with people trying to one up each other, then you'll definitely be able to appreciate the humor in this show.",1371859200,3,230,4.871794871794871
5272604,5,B00965ZJT2,If you like british comedy this is a good one loved all actors real funny fast shipping nicem to see what might have happend for the summer games lol lol,1369612800,,153,4.133333333333334
5272605,5,B00965ZJT2,"I love this show.  My only complaint is that there is not more it.  Twenty Twelve follows the fake Olympic Deliverance Commission as they prepare for the London 2012 Olympic games.  The cast of characters is highlighted by established comedic and dramatic British actors such as Hugh Bonneville, Jessica Hynes, and Olivia Colman.  The more they say, the more you realize that they're all good at talking, but not at creating anything of substance.  The show follow The Office style of filming, but each exchange is carefully crafted to feel as real as possible while still leaving you laughing and frustrated.  Its too bad that BBC America buried this late on a weekend night, because I think it could have been huge in the states.  However, that has now been remedied by the release of the complete series on DVD.  The only thing lacking is special features as the included cast and crew interviews are all too short.  There may only be 13 episodes, but they're well worth the money if you like absurdist comedy.",1360108800,8,1013,4.742857142857143
5272606,5,B00965ZJT2,"It seemed to take the BBC forever to get this on DVD!  This is absolutely the funniest thing that I saw on TV last year. It is Brit humor at its best - a bit dry, just like life.  I could see much of this happening to me if I were in that situation. Very well done and the writing is spot on!",1359504000,3,292,3.619047619047619
8536510,5,B00965ZJT2,Just watch this. so funny. and then watch W1A.,1529280000,,46,4.222222222222222
8536511,5,B00965ZJT2,so well written and performed. We watch it over and over.,1521417600,,57,4.2727272727272725
8536512,5,B00965ZJT2,"Brilliant:-) My husband and I loved W1A and found out that twenty twelve featured many of the same actors Could not find it on TV but saw that Amazon had the DVD so it was a stocking stuffer for my husband. It is fun and silly and wonderful. The characters are very British and though we did not know some of the English celebrities that were mentioned, it did not matter. I am not one for most ""comic"" shows but this one and W1A truly are funny and well written plus well acted.",1514678400,,479,4.161290322580645
8536513,4,B00965ZJT2,"Superb English social satire, probably lost on American viewers.",1511049600,,64,6.222222222222222
8536514,1,B00965ZJT2,Not at all what was expected. Very disappointing.,1503619200,,49,5.25
8536515,5,B00965ZJT2,"I gave this as a gift. I enjoyed watching this on tv (BBCAmerica) and knew a friend would enjoy. That was the reason for my purchase. ""Documentary"" -style, like ""The Office"", very funny satire with Hugh Bonneville (Downton),Olivia Coleman (Broadchurch), Morven Christie (Grantchester) and more.",1499731200,,294,5.555555555555555
