7688897,5,B01CQY68C6,"It MORE than met expectations - arrived on time, well wrapped - and since I am a major fan of Mark Lowry I knew what to expect - humour, theology, wonderful music - The Martins are wonderful - and Stan Whitmire a great addition.  Mark's humour is ALWAYS on point, never smarmy - and leaves you with more than a smile - and when Mark sings - you know he has a God Blessed voice.  I hope this is not his LAST dvd - I look forward to buying the next one :)",1488758400,3,453,3.860215053763441

7688905,5,B01CQY68C6,"One of the best Gaither videos out there. Only downside is it's a little long, seemingly much longer than most Gaither Gospel videos, but you don't have to watch it all in one sitting like I did. Mark Lowry reaches his pinnacle in wit and comedic performance, all of which is intimately dovetailed with beautiful classic songs featuring mainly The Martins, one of my favorite Gospel groups. I think you would be sorry if this was not part of your Gospe video collection. It's one for the ages.",1478217600,7,493,4.613636363636363

7688909,5,B01CQY68C6,You will be lifted up with JOY.  This video is just the best feeling thing I've seen in along time.. Mark is a pleasure to listen to and he can really sing and is so funny. You can't stop laughing  and sometimes the tears just fall. The Martins are one of the best singing groups I've ever heard in my life. The harmony is unbelievable.
