It demonstrated the differences between how Master Otsuka practised his Wado karate and how Master Ajari practises his Wado karate. This is important to show that although Master Otsuka is dead, Wado karate can still evolve.",1093392000,,355,5.357142857142857
7889738,5,6305435359,"I first saw a review for this video in a French magazine (for the French language edition) and assumed therefore that it had been made in France. Wrong! It was made in the US then exported all over the place and  translated into different languages including, would you believe, Japanese.  The reason is that, apart from being beautifully made, the video is unique  because it includes about 20 minutes of professionally made film of the man  who started this style of karate performing his own creation. Rather like  watching Wolfgang Mozart, play Mozart! The film was taken at Berkeley  University in 1965 and had been in a private collection ever since. Its  discovery was a landmark event as no high quality record of this long dead  karate master had been available previously, but now we could study every  movement at normal and slow speed and rewind to our heart's content. The  show is sensitively and very professionally presented with traditional  flute and koto background music and really nice old photos of the master in  his youth. Obviously the people who put it together loved the subject  because every small part of the production is done with real style and the  show, even after many, many viewings still looks really polished to my eye.  I bought part 2 when it came out and will buy the same two shows on DVD  when it is released",950400000,5,1352,4.713675213675214
