2922153,4,B000UJCAM2,"Any film graced by the presence of Hollywood great Barbara Stanwyck is worth a look, and although My Reputation is a study of the more strait jacketed morals of the forties, the fine performance of Barbara Stanwyck, stops this movie just short of becoming an over emotional, pius mess.
Stanwyck plays the role of a recently widowed woman with two pre-teen sons both away at school. Her mother - played by the screens most dominant matriarch, the laudable Lucille Watson - is horrified when her daughter refuses to don the black garb of mourning, as she herself has worn continually for many years since the passing of her husband.
Stanwyck is restless, doesn't believe her life at thirty is over, and accepts an invitation from her friend (Eve Arden) to join her and her husband ski-ing.
It is here she meets the always pleasant George Brent -  who made a career out of playing what were essentially support roles to the great women stars of the thirties and forties. He made 12 movies with Bette Davis, who adored him, plus others with Myrna Loy, Greta Garbo, Jean Arthur, Claudette Colbert,Anne Sheridan, and a host of others.
Sparks fly when Brent meets Stanwyck and although she makes it plain she doesn't have casual affairs, she falls for him and begins dating him.
The gossip mongers are horrified, and there is a scene where Stanwyck takes Brent to a party so she can introduce him to her friends and quell their speculation, which has by now reached her sons ears.
The dialogue is snappy and to the point, and Stanwyck, combined with Eve Arden at her sarcastic best, keep the picture from becoming turgid, weighed down with the drama.
Stanwyck was one of the giants of the Golden Age of movies and she proves her worth here as she gives her best efforts yet again.",1221264000,47,1773,4.664536741214057
2922154,4,B000UJCAM2,"I first found this small treasure on Turner Classic Movies. Deals with a woman (Stanwyck) who is widowed at an early age with two early teen boys in the upper-class Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, IL. She's expected, not only by society but her socialite mother (played to perfection by Lucille Watson), to follow a path of strict decorum that many widows were expected to follow back in those days. However, Stanwyck decides to throw away alot of those old practices and pave the way for herself and stumbles upon a brash, handsome and suitable Army officer (George Brent)for frindship and romance. Needless to say all does not settle well with mother (Watson) or her social community. Thank God best friend Eve Arden is their for support. Good script, solid acting by all",1217203200,23,772,4.81203007518797
2922155,4,B000UJCAM2,"""My Reputation""  is another one of those treasures that are not well known.  The story line was very good and the acting was great too!  Plus it was a Christmas movie--so how can you go wrong!  Some of the topics covered were very serious--false accusations, an overbearing mother, empty nest syndrome and making the correct choices that are unselfish and not just for the thrill of today but mindful of future consequences of our actions.  Barbara Stanwyck did it again--she can make you cry because she is so believable in her parts.  Another one of her tear-jerkers is ""Stella Dallas""  which also deals with a mother making unselfish choices for the benefit of her child.  Although ""My Reputation"" is a serious movie, and might not hold everyone's attention, there is nothing inapproriate for family viewing.  (Don't be  misled by her sultry pose on the cover--she plays a classy character.)",1196553600,36,894,4.939597315436242

2922179,3,B000UJCAM2,"Let me be very clear about this right from the start.
This is VERY much a ""women's picture"".
Nowadays it would be called by the abominable term ""chick-flick"".

The issues, if indeed they are still even such today, are all very much those affecting women in the forties.
They seem very trivial to us now and I doubt if many of them would raise so much as an eye-brow in our current sex-obsessed society. However back then there was a strong hang-over from Victorian times regarding death, the acceptable forms of mourning, dating, sexual relationships and the way women should behave.
The maintenance of a ""reputation"" (a good one that is), was of prime importance to ladies and families who considered themselves ""proper"" within society.
Tongues would wag, and reputations were the first victims of salacious gossip.

Barbara Stanwyck is a young recent widow with two adolescent children. Her daunting Mother is a hangover from those aforementioned Victorian times, ...all black crepe, veils and jet jewellery some 25 years or so after her own husband's demise.
She tries to manipulate her daughter in the ""correct"" ways of mourning but of course they seem out dated even to Stanwyck.
Then there's the question of a young widow being back in the dating market and the forms that are acceptable, if at all!
Sex of course being the prime concern.

It seems laughable today that Stanwyck is so afraid of any physical relationship, (she's had two kids!), but that situation makes up the bulk of the story. Yes there are mentions of some other issues such as the ""empty nest syndrome"", domineering mothers, the extent to which we allow our children to come between us and our happiness, but ultimately it's all about whether Stanwyck will ""do"" it or not.
I must say her new man is remarkably patient and understanding for an army bloke!
He's a self -confessed ""not-the-marrying-kind"", and Stanwyck vacillates  for just about the whole movie, even to the extent of a melodramatic reaction when she catches sight of the bed in her man's apartment! She's reluctant to even sit on the couch! She thinks it might be ""a trap""!

For so long she won't, then finally when she will, ...HE won't! (He's no cad to take advantage of a lady's rapidly changing mind you see?)

Performances are all good, with the single exception of a young girl at the beginning who you just want to slap!
Even if it is just to cause her to stop her rapid-fire yabbering and draw breath before she collapses due to lack of oxygen.
You will know who I mean when you hear her.

Eve Arden is a standout as an understanding friend, and Lucile Watson is excellent in another of her ""Mother"" roles.
George Brent provides the VERY patient male love interest.
The movie tries to be a bit of a ""weepy"" towards the end with one of those departing train situations so beloved of the genre, but I was never engaged enough to tear-up, and you probably won't be either. It reads as melodrama today.

Then there's the ending when ""good"" girls are rewarded by the unlikely result of their once allergic to marriage man suddenly undergoing an instant conversion and now wanting to waltz down the aisle with his girl, settle down behind the white picket fence with pipe and slippers into domestic bliss. And all because she was such a good girl and wouldn't put out?

I do think it important to see movies as products of their time and this one so very much is just that.
Today none of this would be of great concern with the possible exception of the empty nest syndrome.

My copy came in a four pack TCM of Stanwyck movies. Others are ""Baby Face"",  ""Annie Oakley"" and ""East Side, West Side"".
ALL the prints are truly excellent, but like many do suffer a little from the audio fading in and out.
This one has been my least favourite but worth it for the performances and a glimpse of how far ""morality"" has progressed ....or loosened, depending on your viewpoint.
Lucile Watson gets to say ""Conventions were made because there was a need for them"".
I'd say they were made to control people but then that's said with the gift of hindsight.

Three Stars, ...well three and a half if that was possible here.",1398816000,,4151,4.655737704918033
2922180,3,B000UJCAM2,I prefer when she is strong or conniving (see Baby Face or Double Indemnity). She'll never be happy until those brats are out of the house and she moves out of Lake Forest.,1396742400,,172,4.242424242424242
2922181,5,B000UJCAM2,I have been looking for this movie for years and have finally found it.  Don't ask why I love I couldn't tell you because I don't know myself.  Maybe because she goes against  society to be with the man she loves.  If you love Barbara Stanwyck you will love this movie.,1394928000,,269,4.215686274509804
2922182,4,B000UJCAM2,"I watched this years ago while on Christmas Vacation on our local channel.  At the time, I adored this film. I watched it this pat Christmas for the first time in about 30 years and it is still good .  I added it to my ""Christmas Collection"" and it is a welcome change from the usual ""scrooges"", fantasy angel stories, frothy holiday musicals and other subjects that populate this seasonal fare.

A fun revisit to old manners and mores. Stanwick is great as always; George Brent - who was a staple leading man of the era - is conformable in the part but doesn't knock your socks off.  Supporting cast is also fine.",1390176000,,614,4.407079646017699

2922184,5,B000UJCAM2,"Being a big Barbara Stanwyck fan - I can honestly say, if you are a big Stanwyck fan - you will not be disappointed!  This character she plays really reflects true Barbara Stanwyck ""style.""  She evolves from ""yes"" girl to a VERY determined lady who knows what she wants and is not afraid to go after it - in this case a man, not too keen on marriage.  Both Barbara Stanwyck and Walter Brennan play out this film wonderfully.  Barbara herself said this role was one of her favorites of all time - probably because it reflected Barbara herself:  A wo,an who in her real life was determined to make it as a star, despite her tough years growing up - her own older sister could not even stop her.  Barbara has certainly lived up to her ""reputaion"" - a strong woman who commands a strong stage appearance and respect, but always poised.  And why not!  With her tough childhood - she worked her way to the top, being the top paid acctress during WWII  eer  a.  She DESERVES RESPECT!  She also deserved a REAL OSCAR not an Honorary one - later in life.",1363996800,2,1045,4.329896907216495
2922185,5,B000UJCAM2,"I love this movie and now I can watch it whenever I get the urge.  Love George Brent and Barbara Stanwyck.  Again, something to watch when there isn't anything worth watching on television - which is too often for the money we pay!",1361750400,,231,4.348837209302325

2922187,3,B000UJCAM2,"Nicely produced soaper.  Stanwyck is fine, but the film as a whole is contrived and stilted, even by 1943 standards when it was produced, but not released until 1946.",1356739200,,166,4.724137931034483
2922188,3,B000UJCAM2,"I'm a huge Stanwyck fan and own several of her movies including two collections, but this is one of my least favorite movies. Stanwyck is best when she portrays a strong woman. In this roll she is believable, but not convincing as the writing does not support its own conflicts. If you must see Barbara Stanwyck, then by all means don't miss this one, but it is far from any of her greatest performances.",1353974400,,404,4.472972972972973
2922189,4,B000UJCAM2,"Barbara Stanwyck was one of the best actresses of the 1930's and 40's.  My Reputation was made in the 1940's when she was at her zenith, she's beautiful and oh-so-confident.  In the movie she plays a woman, newly widowed, living with her two young sons and looking forward to a long, lonely, dull life, and a mother that nags.  She goes on vacation with friends and meets a man that looks at life differently. They like each other.  She goes home, and she runs into him again, and love happens.  But, he doesn't want to get married and she's being pressured by her upper-class friends to give him up and come have more fun, single, with us.  Of course, her mother and two young sons put on pressure as well.  The ending is exactly as it should be.  You will not be disappointed.",1353801600,,778,4.391608391608392

2922192,4,B000UJCAM2,"""My Reputation"" (1943/46, dir.: Curtis Bernhardt): Barbara Stanwyck in a typical Bette Davis melodrama. She is a young, wealthy widow with two children getting acquainted to an officer (George Brent), but society does not want to have her happy so early after her first husband's death... Stanwyck gives a beautiful, touching performance, proving that she can not only be the tough lady. The rest of the picture is quite well, but not outstanding. The end is much too moral-driven, because it is never clear why we shall accept that some of the old conventions do make sense. This film suffers from the fact that is risks comparison with the earlier ""Now, Voyager"" (starring Bette Davis), e.g. by the appearance of Gladys Cooper in a similar role. I think the not-so-happy ending in ""Now, Voyager"" is more convincing, because in ""My Reputation"", there is really no reason why our couple should not come together. Therefore, the script needs to invent what was natural and logical in ""Now, Voyager"".",1261785600,,998,4.982035928143713

8213480,5,B000UJCAM2,"As the story goes, Barbara Stanwyck lost the lead in Mildred Pierce to Joan Crawford, which motivated her to give one of her best performances in My Reputation.

Stanwyck plays Jessica Drummond, recently divorced woman of means with two young sons. She innocently falls for military man Major Scott Landis, who has an undeserved playboy rep, played by George Brent. (Brent began his movie acting career in the early thirties as a Clark Gable clone of sorts, playing roles that would have suited Gable fairly well. Frankly, I prefer Brent, who is a significantly more skilled actor than Gable, and a hell of a lot more charming.) At any rate, Ms. Drummond is chastised by her snotty friends, and even snottier mother, for associating with a fella like Major Landis; but she sticks by him, and even flaunts her beau around town, until her two young boys begin to pay the price. At this point, Jessica must decide to either protect her boys or continue her affair with Landis...or perhaps she'll come up with another approach.

I would name this as one of Stanwyck's best films, in a 60-plus film career. As far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with Baby Face, The Lady Eve, and maybe even Double Indemnity.

Written by screenwriter and novelist Catherine Turner. Wonderful costumes by the inimitable Edith Head. Eve Arden is terrific as Stanwyck's best buddy, and Jerome Cowan plays a convincing cad.",1522713600,,1403,4.8375

8213487,3,B000UJCAM2,"Sometimes film, especially older films like the one under review Barbara Stanwycks My Reputation can act as a slice of social history of a time when mores were different, when what was proper in gentile society and why were different. Take the background issue where; what is a lovely younger widow to do with her life in society once her husband is gone at a young age. Today with the six million possible living arrangements and live and let live attitude among many sectors of the population the way this film played out, maybe even the fact that the question had even been posed would seem to be something out of a social archeological dig.

Still it is interesting to see how the situation played out so here is the skinny. Jess, played by Barbara Stanwyck in a not very memorable role in like say Double Indemnity, a proper high society recent widow with two sons is expected by her social peers and a nose-out-of-joint mother to burn herself on the pyre of her love for her late husband who by all accounts was a good guy, a good dad too. But Jess brought up in the straight and narrow high society world of Chicago and never having a previous chance to blossom decided that she would step out a bit, get a new fellow maybe but not endlessly grieve over her late husband. Eventually through the good graces of friends who takes her with them on a vacation in ski country she meets a Major Landis, played by George Brent, who is both charming and unattached. The rest of the film revolves around their growing attachment, their intentions toward each other and the fact that with a war on who knows what will happen in this cockeyed world. That and then the kids, two young but growing boys who are still attached to their fathers memory and who balk at anybody else coming into their lives-sound familiar.

Of course along the way plenty of eyebrows are raised, plenty of eyes are rolled as Jess almost escapes from the social bonds that chain her to that leafy suburban existence that she knows too well is suffocating her. She learns a hard lesson on who your friends are but also that in a lot of ways she was stuck in her upbringing which meant that her boys had to come first-and then see what would happen if the good Major got back from the war in one piece. They called this film a tear-jerker back then,  a melodrama, but today it couldn't be made because nobody would believe that a young good-looking woman with kids, or not, wouldnt be out on the hustings looking, well, looking for something. A nice period piece though .",1463443200,,2541,4.4838012958963285
