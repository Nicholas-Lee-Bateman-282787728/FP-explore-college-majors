Anytime I fall off track I pop this right in. You do have to stay consistent though. Definitely worth it if you want to get right. I used to do it twice a day and I snapped back like hell.

If you are doing the exercises the transitions, and editing won't even matter. It may matter to you if you are just sitting on a chair watching. I have lost weight and I don't even follow the meal plan. Great video if you are looking to get your heart pumping, and tone up!",1480377600,5,425,4.461538461538462
5545883,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Let me start by saying the content of the video meaning the workout routine itself is good. It does get your heart rate up and you will sweat! However, the music, graphics, and meal plan in the pamphlet is amateur. I would dare not eat cabbage soup for days...no thank you! But on a brighter note if you are looking for an inexpensive workout video to substitute you from going to the gym or you want to do some exercises that will target a certain area of your body this will do the job.",1479254400,4,488,4.202127659574468

5545910,3,B00B1DC1CA,I am giving this 3 stars becaus eof the poor editing and the very vague meal plan you get. The soup and chili are great but it doesn't give you the fll recipe a to how long to cook what to sautee first etc. and they have poor examples of the type of meal plans you should be eating. I went to their official website and they do not go into detail they just kindof pretend this dvd never happened and on to the next. This dvd is also 60.00 on Amazon which is very expensive and totally not worth it. The workout regimen is great but you have to keep pausing it when they say cool down (they don't tell you how long the cool down is either) Because of this I will not be purchasing nay more of their dvds. This to me was more of a quick comeup and not a dvd meant to empower all women.,1464134400,,783,3.9

5545935,5,B00B1DC1CA,its great i did it yesterday and im extremely sore today. you will need 5-8 lb dumbells for this workout. the only two cons is 1) not much demonstration of proper form and 2) no cool down  or stretch which is very critical in any workout one reason why im too sore to move. im pretty fit so thats why i say this is a good workout cause i do feel it today I wanted to update my post!!!! wow! this dvd work my butt Is getting HUGE!,1460505600,2,429,3.875

5545967,5,B00B1DC1CA,I have to say that I disagree with the reviews as far as saying that the photos of people with the weight are the ones that go to their gym... not true.  I live in N.C. and My weight loss results came from following the meal plan and doing the dvd. .I definitely recommend this dvd to anyone... there are editing issues but other than than you can get past it .,1453248000,4,361,4.013888888888889
5545968,5,B00B1DC1CA,"LOVE IT!!! I bought this DVD about three years ago and still use it to this day. This mother and daughter duo are very inspiring, love how their workouts make you sweat/burn and how you cry when they add more sets lol. LOVE how they have real women working out in the video and not fitness models. REAL BLACK WOMEN LIKE U AND ME. I recommend this for any woman out there that don't workout often or even at all, this can be a start up for you, to get a rotuine of what you can do at home as well as the gym. This dvd is deeper than just a workout video it is a reminder that BLACK GIRLS WORK OUT TOO!!!!! Also their 30 day meal plan isn't so bad either,you just cant cheat while following it lol

Then I read the reviews about how effective the video really is and decided to take a chance. Let me tell you, THE EDITING IS NOT BAD AT ALL! People need to kick rocks. I was expecting the worse, when in return I got the best workout I have ever had in my life. I have purchased several workout videos in the past and this is by far the best video. I like how they keep you guessing you never know what you're going to be doing next. Expect to sweat from the beginning to the end. This was well worth my money. I probably won't do the meal plan because I know I won't stick to it. I working on my eating habits one day at a time. I have a workout mat but no weights yet so I used two water bottles. I wasn't about to let that stop me from working out. Mainly I want to make exercising a routine in my life and Im glad I picked this video. When this becomes too easy (which won't be anytime soon, lol) I will order their other video.  The price is better than a gym membership.

I can say that by following their meal plan and exercise 4-5 times a week for 45 mins (the length of the video) I was able to lose weight (and some inches too). Meal plan is not hard to follow.

There is no cool down and the ab workout is a little difficult but I'm going to stick with it. I will post an update in one month.

Music cloud've been better but overall great to support independent female trainers who understands the female struggle.,1428796800,,328,4.576271186440678

5546251,2,B00B1DC1CA,"Satisfied with shipping and arrival. The video it self is very low quality/low budget. A lot of errors, sound sucks, timing sucks, ect. Their presentation also sucks the daughter had looong 30inch hair in her head. She was more focused on performing for the camera than actually excersing and the mom i have to give it to her though, she got down. She just couldn't talk or count right, her errors were very noticable and was not edited. Lets just say, I am usually not a credic on stuff like that but this video was very poor quality. Mine is somewhere collecting dust. I tried it about 5x, even turned the volume all the way down but i get still distracted from all the flaws.",1424822400,,678,4.432
5546252,5,B00B1DC1CA,I absolutely love both of the DVDs and meal plan. I I iginally started using the DVD with a friend last year and had great results. I somehow fell off doing the workouts.

5546258,5,B00B1DC1CA,"A workout DVD designed for black women! Mother and daughter team helping us to eat right and look our best! I loved it! Most of the review commented on the horrible editing, I didn't see too many issues with editing that would cause a lot of confusion. Both women have great personalities and I LOVE the motivational phrases they both use to help me push through the workout! The #1 thing I really need is upper body and Ellen will give it to you, the mat rows were different and had my arm muscles burning. Ms. Lana Luxe took care of the lower body with plenty of squats, boy do I need those! My advise to anyone that is new to the workout is to get yourself 5 pound weights a water bottle, towel and set your goals high. I will have to get the 2nd dvd and rotate it with this DVD just because I like a LOT of variety. Congratz to the ladies and their success!",1423353600,6,861,4.130952380952381

5546364,3,B00B1DC1CA,Wasn't a realistic workout. They don't even do the workout all the way through. it also seemed like a low budget workout DVD. It was low quality but on a positive note you can achieve results from the meal plan and from doing the workout because any movement is better than none. I am a cheerleader/athlete and I expected more out of the DVD. It may be good for woman who know nothing about working out.

5546628,3,B00B1DC1CA,This DVD has the worst editing! It it's not worth the price I paid for it...$29.99 but I can say they did excellent putting it down to $14.99 should've been the price. But even with all the bad flaws...my cousin and I lost weight and slimmed down tremendously with just 2 1/2 months of doing this. We didn't follow the meal plan or anything. My blood sugar levels were under control. I didn't need my medicines or anything. But when school started back we got out of the mood of doing it and lost ourselves. We are now back doing this and patiently waiting for the same great results plus more! People need to stop blaming the DVD and blame themselves because you can lose weight!

I will be trying the 21 day challenge!",1400544000,,345,4.242424242424242
5546729,4,B00B1DC1CA,"This video is very intense!  It was recommended to me by my cousin; I kept seeing great weight loss results through her photos. This is no workout for whimps! There was no actual warm up; they got right to business!!!  So if it's been a while since you've worked out, expect a challenge.  Also, it is very wise to do the meal instructions before beginning. I attempted the workout without detoxing, and needless to say I didn't make it to the end.  I felt very heavy and out of shape.

This workout would be better if there were fun songs to workout to instead of just some music playing in the background.  Also the transition between trainers and the next workout doesn't seem very smooth.  It would also be awesome if the trainers actually completed the whole workout with the class they're instructing on video.
If you're serious about busting pounds and taking shape, this workout is for you!",1400284800,2,897,4.60377358490566

There is a slight echo on the DVD but nothing that is so bad to the point where it's annoying.  If you're focused on the workout, you won't even notice the noise.  Very happy with my purchase and sad I waited so long to purchase.",1399593600,,349,4.088235294117647
5546732,5,B00B1DC1CA,I LOVE IT WELL WORTH THE MONEY USE THE DVD EVERYDAY STARTED LOSEING THE WITHIN A WEEK LOVE IT !!!,1399507200,,97,3.9
5546733,2,B00B1DC1CA,"Ok.  Again i'm repeating this don't buy into the hype! I saw so many reviews on here, youtube, instagram, and whatever else on social media from a couple of weeks of researching. So after seeing all the pictures and video testimonials of girls losing weight I was so convinced or for better words I was TRICKED. They claim this video is for all girls shapes, sizes, beginning, advanced, etc which is not true.  I started this workout today. I got through halfway of this video and stopped it. Its terrible. I don't even know what exercises are on the rest on the video and won't be finding out.  I started to give it 1 star but I didn't because I don't hate the video I do dislike it and regret purchasing it. The warmup at the beginning reminds you of the same warmup you would do in elementary school when you would be in P.E. class. Everything is so repetitive!! Which really sucks because if you are like me that's out of shape and beginning they will have you doing the same thing over and over again until you feel like you're going to crash. That's not a good feeling at all. I had to take a couple of breaks because of the repetitiveness.  The mom (Ellen) is just SCREAMING at you for no reason and was trying her hardest to come up with clever sayings with this ""YOU GO GIRL"" type of thing going on which is so unnecessary and after a while it gets so annoying. The daughter (Lana) is kind of a joke. She lucked up with a nice body of good genes which is also obvious because she doesn't really do the workout she is instructing you to do. She going have you doing million squats and hardly do the exercises. Which is another reason she is a joke because her main concern is having a round behind (which nothing is wrong with that because im trying to lift up my butt as well). So during the squats exercises they zoom in on her butt during a couple of mins of it which is a little disturbing to me and somewhat creepy. I don't know if it's suppose to be for motivation but its frustrating seeing it zoomed in like that because I would like a rounder firm butt and it makes me feel a little bad about myself even more. She doesn't even work out in the video or break a sweat. The girls in the video that's working out in the background are unmotivated, confused just like you will be, and seem so out of place. They barely do the workout themselves and slow down halfway through the video because they are tired.  The editing is not great but its ok. It's decent. They will confuse you so during the whole time you will be looking like wtf. The workout so far is nothing somebody should do over 3-4 days. I wouldn't even recommend this workout for two days straight. It doesn't seem like it would be good for your body and muscles if you're just starting out. I was just going to do the meal plan but I took a second look at it and it's very STRICT! I will follow the first week of no meat and only veggies, fruit, etc to kind of refresh my body. Even in the meal plan they said ""YOU'RE GOING TO THINK YOU'RE HUNGRY BUT YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY."" That's total BS! YOU WILL BE HUNGRY BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING YOU STARVING YOURSELF! For all that I could have starved myself without a help of a meal plan. I'm not saying it's impossible to lose weight from this DVD. There are girls out there who have but I wonder if it's actually by following the meal plan and doing the workout 4-5 days completely with nothing else extra.  Its not worth the money. Thank god i got this DVD under 20 dollars so not much money was spent. I hate it for the people who had to spend over 30 dollars for a copy. I don't blame you for being upset. If you was thinking about getting this DVD SAVE your money. So now I just plan on taking my time, creating my own workout plan for 4-5 days of  squats with my dumb bells, 10-15 minute cardio from videos on youtube, do toning exercises with my dumb bells, drink only water, constant movement I do at my job, and eat less and healthier SOMETHING I WISH I WOULD HAVE JUST DID FROM THE BEGINNING!! Because i'm not in a rush to lose weight and I know eventually with dedication and hard work it'll come off.  I honestly wished I had a positive review for this DVD but I don't. Now i'm trying to figure out what i'm going to do with this DVD. One of the three things: I'll either give it to somebody, give it to goodwill, or sell on ebay, amazon, etc. All i got to say is lesson learned!",1399248000,3,4408,4.195985832349469

5546736,4,B00B1DC1CA,I read the other reviews and was really skeptical about purchasing this DVD but I'm glad I did. It served the purpose as an exercise/workout DVD.

5546737,4,B00B1DC1CA,It's definitely a good workout.  No question about that.  The inferior editing is a bit distracting on your first workout but once you begin to sweat you won't even notice it.  Great legs workout.  I've heard that they corrected a lot of the issues in this one in the sequel.  Either way this one will make you sweat!,1398988800,,317,4.396551724137931

5546786,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I love this DVD!!!!

I rate it a 4 simply because of the editing, but I was still able to follow the DVD.  I am going into my 3rd week using this DVD and I can say it definately works.  I started at 191lbs (38 waist, 44 hips) and 3 weeks later I am at 182 (32 waist and 38 hips).  I don't really look into the weight loss because I believe I have built more muscle and become more toned (muscle > fat).  I didn't really follow the meal plan that came along with the DVD.  The things I did to assist on this journey was I increased my water intake to about 96 ounces per day, I did stop eating red meat, and bought healthier options of food.  For example - instead of whole eggs I will eat egg whites.  I also began eating alot of fish (Salmon) and chicken breast (skinless).  I haven't had any fried foods and I can say I feel extrememly lighter and more energetic.  I incorporated all these changes with the DVD 5 days a week along with some mild cardio such as walking at a fast pace for 30-45 minutes on my off days.  I am very pleased with the results from this DVD.  Just remember when trying to get Healthy & Fit, it is a lifestyle change - not a diet.",1397692800,3,1158,3.9869565217391303

5546906,5,B00B1DC1CA,"I have to be honest, it took me a while to order this dvd because of all the disappointments I had with other famous workout dvd out there. I really gave my all and never really had major results in the first 48 hrs that I had with BGWT. I am just so happy I invested in this dvd. I read many of the previous reviews regarding editing, they weren't all bad and not much of an issue to me, I still saw results. I look forward to working out every day...but I have to admit the squat section is not my favorite lol but I push on through. I notice my legs slimming and feeling toned. Wow, I can just go on. It works!

Im a foodie, enjoyed the recipes and even got creative with some of it. Give it a try. Believer in BGWT!",1393804800,,719,3.9246575342465753

5546911,4,B00B1DC1CA,"This DVD will definitely get you sweating and you will fill the work.  However, the quality is not good.  The DVD is choppy and does not transition smoothly from one section to the other.  Also, when fading in from one screen to the next, they are sometimes on a different exercise than you should be on without prior prompting, then it goes back to the exercise that you were doing.",1393632000,,383,4.442857142857143

I must say I was very happy with it. The edits aren't perfect but they are not as terrible as other reviews claimed. I was still able to easily follow along. I wore my HRM and burned 400 calories in 40 minutes. I'm very happy with it.,1393632000,,393,3.925

5546951,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I purchased the DVD based on the fact I was happy to see a totally African American workout duo.  Yes, I agree with some of the comments about the editing quality, but hey, I didn't purchase the DVD to exercise my editing critic skills, I purchased the DVD for a home based workout and it does delivers.  At first, I tried to do each segment in a single workout session. Nope, didn't work for me, so I do the warm up and one other segment per day.  This keeps me from getting discouraged.  I titled my review, ""Gotta Start Somewhere"" because these two ladies have done more than most.  I'm sure the second video will be better, based on more working capital and better videography/editing. But for now, great workout! Great meal plan! Great squats segment! And what impressed me the most is the Mom, Ellen Ector, is the mother of 5 and is 60 years young. If her body doesn't motivate you to workout, nothing will.",1393027200,4,913,4.4431137724550895

I feel they have accomplished that I won't take that away from them....And the workout kicks but with results!!

I've been going for 5 days now and have been able to do so everyday! There's no stretch at the beginning but that is fine (no cool down as well but you know you're about to wrap up anyway because it becomes less intense). The workout itself is very simple and I was thinking..""Oh, yeah! I can do this"". After 10 minutes in my face was covered in sweat! This first day I almost wanted to say F it but I got at it the next day and it was hard but I got through it alot better than the first day. **After the first workout I felt sick and wanted to vomit! Barely could stand in the shower lol** I feel great on day 5! Not following the meal plan but I'm eating clean and counting calories with the LOSE IT app on my phone. This is an awesome workout! I see a difference in my clothes already. Looking at results from others and looking at both their instagram pages helps keep me on track and remaining motivated! I've been telling everyone about this!

Of course the transitions were off.  They appeared to be reading scripts at times and spoke more loudly than needed nut thumbs up for a great workout. I was very pleased! Once  I finish this one I will purchase the second dvd they just came out with.",1392249600,,1374,4.196969696969697

The workout itself is well worth the 14.99 or 19.99 that you will pay for it. It includes a meal plan that if you follow will allow you to have noticeable changes in your body in just 7 days and drastic changes in just 21. This is great 45 minute daily workout.

They scream the entire time, you can barely understand what the daughter is saying. There's no warm up or cool down. They switch sections without any notice..I'm doing one exercise the screen goes black for a second and then they're on to the next exercise. If the workouts really do produce the results they claim I will never find out because the video is just all over the place.

5547141,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Soooo, I did read the reviews before buying this DVD. Someone I follow on instagram was using the part 2 version of this dvd so I decided to check out both of the trainers pages and I was convinced to get it. I got this one cos it was only $15 and I am cheap lol....anyways, they must have fixed the editing issues and sound problems that everyone had been complaining about because my DVD has great sound and as for the editing....there is one point during the ab portion when Lana says to repeat the ab workouts she just showed but then it goes back to her mom lol and then the cameraman pans weirdly sometimes lol....besides that it's not that bad.

Also, Lana...yea she barely does any working out lol but I literally put her on mute and play my own music when she's on. Her voice is irritating to me lol....anyways my body was mos def feeling the burn and I did sweat while doing this dvd. I am still using it and I have lost 7.5 pounds so far. I do believe that the before and after pictures are real but I don't think that all used the dvd. They may have gone to the classes too or only done the classes. Who knows? Also, everyone loses weight differently. I like the dvd and the meal plan is cool too although I would never just eat cabbage soup all week long, I would pass out fo sho! lol I altered it to work for me. I did eliminate meat mostly but yea I indulged sometimes. I also calorie count so I don't eat below 1200 a day...cos that's putting your body into starvation mode and who wants that? lol  I like that it has other things in the book too like what things are good to eat etc.

Anyways I would reccommend the dvd for this price, I wouldnt pay full price for it though. I heard the second dvd is better too and that they fixed a lot of the issues that were wrong with this one. I will wait for that to go on sale lol",1390780800,6,1839,4.074585635359116

I felt like I did not waste my time and received a great workout. The editing is a little off but it did not take away from the workout for me. It is worth the money and the workouts are comparable to other workout videos on the markets. It is a great video to have in your collection if you love working out at home and want a great workout.

5547160,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Pros: Great cardio and weight resistance techniques used. Mom and daughter have clever ways to motivate women of color especially. The before and after picture slide they preview before the video begins is a very good tool for motivation. The use of the same women from the picture slide working out along side the mom and daughter team. I thought that was really unique and a great touch.

Cons: The music overpowers their voices to where you can barely hear their instruction. There are some major editing flaws that confuse your workout until you realize it's a mistake and you have to start overlooking it if you don't want to disrupt the workout. There is no stretching in any portion of this video. Not in the warm up nor in the end. I found that to be the biggest problem with this DVD because I pulled my thigh muscle after just 1 week of using this routine.",1389484800,,866,4.515923566878981

I started the DVD at the end of January 2013 and started the meal plan Superbowl Sunday 2013.  I was well overweight and I was frustrated with the way I looked and how my clothes fit.  This DVD is definitely challenging.  However, I was determined to make a change in my life for the better.  I did the DVD 4-6 times a week along with the meal plan.  I did the meal plan for a month.  At the end of that month, I was about 20 lbs lighter.  I continued to eat right and use the DVD after the 30 days was up.  I am 5'5"".  I went from 178 lbs to 144 lbs.

5547229,4,B00B1DC1CA,of course editing was a little off but once you see it  you will know when to cool down and take breaks . as far as stretching you can do your own stretches in the beginning before you start the actual workout. the dvd its actually a good dvd with great workout you can feel. i love it,1388707200,,285,3.913793103448276

5547235,4,B00B1DC1CA,"The video is good however the background music is not that entertaining and it does not work well with the flow of movement. The transition between the mother and daughter excercise routines are not smooth transitions. Nonetheless, both mother and daughter provide good workouts that I am sure with repitition good results will appear.",1387843200,,335,5.222222222222222
5547236,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Cons:
Include a better warm up for the entire body
Needs better transitions between workout moves. A lot of times I was confused when were moving on
The DVD should include chapters so you can go to the workout you want
Does not include a cool down/stretch at the end of the DVD

Pros:
I was able to sweat
Everyone looks great
New workout moves I have never done (in the abs section and the last rowing section)
Love seeing fit/healthy black women

I would recommend this DVD, especially to those just beginning to use home workout videos. I plan to purchase the next DVD and hope that it does not have the cons I listed above.",1387756800,,626,4.3418803418803416

Overall the DVD was worth the money I paid I got results and met new friends to help me stay on this healthy journey for life.  Will be buying the second DVD when it comes out.

I usually do this right after i finish insanity (First 30 days) or i use this DVD after i eat dinner at night. so far I have lost 8 pounds. I also follow the meal plan, the detox phase can be hard but I made it through even though I cheated a little for the holidays. I have lost 8 pounds in 1 month using this dvd and insanity, if you want to see results fast i suggest using this dvd with other cardio or do this DVD 2 times a day. Despite the technical issues this is a great dvd to workout to, it does not  compare to insanity but I can still get a great workout with this DVD I also  like that it works your whole body like your arms, legs, butt and stomach area.",1386633600,3,752,3.8141025641025643
5547284,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Horrible editing and bad cutaways...first off they are  shouting at you the entire video and there are waaaay to many errors as far as the counting with Ellen. Lana is barely doing the workout and sometimes when Ellen says what's next it cuts away to something different ... The meal plan has some good recipes but no measurements!!! I had sooooo much damn soup!!! Also the cool down is like 5 seconds but it's like a 10 second clock that's counting down extremely fast. I think if they had more organization this video would've been great because I can feel the workout after just two times, I just wish it didn't seem thrown together. I am glad I didn't pay the real price for this or I would've been upset,",1386633600,2,709,4.453846153846154

This was my roadmap to weightloss. I needed the step by step directions that the meal plan gave, on how to eat. Everyone said eat right, but heck what is that salad? The meal plan that comes with the dvd, was everything I needed and more, and each week was something new to add to your diet.  I lost 20lbs in 2 months doing this dvd. I would recommond this for anyone that needs structure. Once you get passed all your excuese and commit, this is the dvd to go for if you want to see results and fast!  I am featured on their instagram page.  I have taken their meal plan and its a lifestyle now.  I started out 205 and now down to 175(with doing other things, but keeping their meal plan...i got tired of doing the same things for more than two months) , the detox is my go to when i want to jump start more weight loss!

I hate working out and I wish I could just cut and rip fat out but I can't. I followed the meal plan and workout for 4 weeks. I started losing inches within the first week. Total I lost 14lbs and 6 inches. If you don't lose with this dvd it may be because you didn't follow the meal plan. My goal was to ""snatch it back"" and purpose a shirt. I met that goal. I was shocked. The Ector ladies are very supportive via Instagram as well. They'd reached out to me everyday I posted my results.

5547372,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I got this DVD to support Black women working out....I was excited to all the women of difference sizes and learn about their prospective on something catered to black women and how our bodies may differ from other races. this video might chellenge those who have never exercised before or if its been a really loooong time. For me, I work out consistently and wanted something different and I was surprised by how many women on their instagram page were losing weight and so quickly so i tried this thinking that it would enlightened me on something new. This video is very poor quality in terms of production. There is not a smooth transition from one exercise to the other or from one circuit to the next. Some of the transitions were even cut off in the middle of the circuit! There is no cool down section, nor is there any real significant explanation on how they have "" learned the black woman's body on how to lose weight"". There is no data they provide as to how and why they make this claim. The attached diet program also eliminates carbs unless you are really hungry, then you can have 1 cup of brown rice. Most scientific data on weightloss and from registered dieticians, will tell you that a weightloss diet includes 45-55% complex carbs, which is where your body gets energy. Restricting carbs to this limit will force your body to break down lean muscle mass which slows down your metabolism. This further comes in to question their authenticity of their education and certifications. I just wish more time went into making this DVD because it has potential to be a great workout! I will still support them in other ways whenever possible, but I will not recommend this DVD.",1383955200,,1691,4.621262458471761

5547374,5,B00B1DC1CA,"When I first read some of these reviews I quickly clicked off of amazon and decided not to buy. However, there were many positive reviews and I was very impressed with the results I saw ladies posting on instagram and twitter, so I decided to give it a try. I'm very pleased with my decision to get this dvd. Overall, it's a great workout and none of the minor editing issues negatively impact the workout. I think there are two extremely minor barely recognizable editing issues with the video. The camera tilts poorly on one segment for about four seconds and the counting kind of throws you off on maybe two segments, but not to the point where you can't keep up or that it has any negative effect on the actual workout. I do this video four times a week coupled with cardio on the alternate days and I already notice great results. I've been doing it for about two weeks. I have increased my running stamina, I do see a slight increase in my butt, and when I first began I was in excrutiating pain but now I am able to get through the entire video. I think any woman wanting to tone and still keep her curves should purchase the video. I really like Lana's portions of the video because she has an amazing body and she kind of pushes you in a way you don't want to quit. This dvd gives you a total body workout in 45 minutes and it's not so difficult that a beginner can't master it with consistency. I plan to continue the basic principles I've learned in this video even after I've met my goal. You will need five pound dumbbells and a mat to complete this workout. Purchase it. You won't regret it.",1383868800,2,1605,4.3003300330033

5547437,4,B00B1DC1CA,Love the workout but you can tell it is there first video. Hope they will be putting another out soon that will correct the things that are missing in this one like the cool down and giving you enough time to put your weights down before going into another move other then  that i think is great,1383350400,,295,4.175438596491228

5547441,2,B00B1DC1CA,The video was poorly made. I am could not workout to it due to the lack of transition between positions. I will keep using better produced workout videos like P90X and T25.

5547593,5,B00B1DC1CA,Great total body workout! I even encouraged some of my friends to buy it & they did!! Love this workout plan!,1381104000,,109,4.238095238095238
5547594,5,B00B1DC1CA,Really gets your heart rate pumping. The cabbage soup and chili are both delicious! I recommend this program and dvd to anyone,1381017600,,126,4.7727272727272725
5547595,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Yes, the editing is a lil wonky. But, if u just follow what she is doing you will be fine. I don't even pay any attention to the count off. I just do as many reps as they are doing in front of me. I can tell u it works!! The day after the 1st day, I could barely move. Muscles I hadn't used in a long time got a workout. The meal plan is very doable. My veggie chili was BOMB!!!! It tasted so good. Lol! I see why ladies lose a lot of belly weight, all the veggies really clean you out. Plus it knocks out constipation & keeps u regular!! I plan on going full throttle after I heal from my surgery!!! FYI: I am not new to working out, fitness, or diets/meal plans. I have bought lots of dvd's & vhs' over the years. But I really like this, flaws & all. I'm surprised b/c I didn't think I would. So I bit the bullet & bought it. Very happy I did!! It's one of those pleasantly surprised situations. B/c I really was not falling for the Instagram hype I saw. I guess it wasn't hype after all. I took away a star for editing. I thought about taking an additional star for these seemingly fraudulent reviews up here. That's just dishonest business practice. It seems to be the new norm in all things sales related these days!",1380844800,,1221,4.049586776859504
5547596,5,B00B1DC1CA,"Love it! Every exercise is exactly what u need to get your body how u want it.  Its not like the other workout dvds I've tried, where there's a lot of dancing and jumping around throughout the entire workout.  That bores me. This is a combination of cardio and toning, so that u can target everything!",1380758400,10,301,4.357142857142857
5547627,5,B00B1DC1CA,"I have read so many luke warm reviews about this DVD (apparently from unattractive salty women who are plagued with hatred and envy from seeing two pretty and fit black women doing very well in the world) and I am so elated that I bought the video for my mom before I read some of these toxic comments. My mom is 59 and she uses the video 3x during the week and on Saturday mornings with me. All my life my mom has been chubby but since she has been using this video she is actually a sexy mama now. I actually bought her a gift certificate to go shopping for some new dresses lol. THIS VIDEO WORKS! If it did not I would not be so proud of these beautiful black women who are helping women all over the world to look and feel their best.

My mom looks great and this video was much less expensive than a gym membership that she probably would never use anyway. I personally do not need to lose weight because I have a 26"" waistline and a slim hour glass figure, but if I ever give birth and need to lose weight I will definitely buy another one of their videos for myself. No, the production is not the very best but none of us are hollywood producers that can critique another person's work. If you need to drop inches and tighten up, this is the right video for you. Go get it!",1380672000,7,1280,4.099601593625498
5547628,5,B00B1DC1CA,Excellent! After three weeks I notice a change. My back is slimmer. I'm not really big. I'm petite. I have no flap on my back. It's almost smooth. My arms are more toned. I'm in love with the DVD.,1380672000,,196,4.051282051282051
5547629,3,B00B1DC1CA,"I bought this DVD on eBay for 14.00 bucks after reading mixed reviews (no way in hell i'm spending $25-30.00). I totally agree with others that the production and transition/quality of the video is horrible. How do you stop completely in the middle of a set, and move on to the next exercise? I love to support black business, but when you produce something of such poor quality, WHY should i spent my hard earned money on it???

Other than quality issues, I found the exercises to be fun and challenging at the same time. Definitely wouldn't recommend this video for every day use..but it would do well being incorporated into an established fitness plan. Overall three stars. Great purpose, with bad execution. HOWEVER..I will be doing this video about 3 times a week. I especially enjoyed the mothers rowing set, and found it to be an added bonus. Just my honest review.",1380672000,2,873,4.705882352941177
5547630,5,B00B1DC1CA,Ready to get fit.  Workout is doable.  This couch potato is now a believer.  You will get results within days,1380672000,,109,4.35
5547631,3,B00B1DC1CA,"it was an okay workout dvd...I love Vitamin Ellen, but the younger girl didn't really seem to like the workout and was just boring",1380672000,,130,4.458333333333333
5547632,5,B00B1DC1CA,"First, let me say (after reading many reviews before purchasing), I am a real person who is not associated with BGW2, have never been to their facility, have never met them in my life.  Like many fans of BGW2 I saw the results on IG and was in awe and impressed.  They were real women that looked like me and made a lifestyle change with the help of a DVD.

I am not a fan of home workouts, DVDs, etc.  I am the type of person who needs to be in the gym with others or classes, just me.  But, I have to tell you, I love this DVD! I actually feel bad the days that I don't do it.  The workout is great for my level (beginner-getting back in the swing) and even for an intermediate level if you do it full out.  It may not be that challenging for someone who is advanced, but it could be used for a good warm up for someone who is advanced.  Bottom line, it's a good workout that is truly a total body workout and I sweat every time I do it.

The meal plan has been challenge for me (personally).  Not the clean eating portion so much as I am a juicer and a pescatarian, but the guide is really like a guide and you have to create your own meal plan.  The detox week is clear, but the rest of the month you have to just follow the tips.  For someone who has a problem with food that's hard.  Not that I run to chips, but I forget to eat 5 times a day and if I have to figure out what to eat for one of those meals, yeah...that's not working out to well LOL.  But, that has nothing to do with BGW2, that's a me thing (smile).  I'm hoping to get on track with the meal portion in the near future.  For now, I'm loving my workout that I do 3-4x a week.

And, not going to spend a lot of time on this, but yes the video and packaging could use some work. As a marketing and training specialist there are some things that would be helpful to capture a complete audience.  The video has some editing issues.  Should the video been priced at $30 or $40, no.  But truthfully I spend $40 on stuff that I don't need all the time, so at least it would be $30-40 spent on something to make me better.  Just my thought...a different way of looking at things.  I decided that instead of complaining about the mistakes or things that could've been better, I adjusted to what I had and made it work.  For example, I modified the amount of ingredients for the soup, because it's just me.  If you follow the recipe that's comes with the DVD then you'll have soup for at least a month (no for real).  For the ab section of the video where the editing is the worse, I simply pause it and finish the ab routine on the other side.  The fact is she goes through it completely on one side and partially through it on the other side.  I would imagine they are open to feedback if you send them an email with your thoughts, comments and suggestions.  No one wants to just hear complaints, so provide them with solutions to make the next video better.

If you want a workout, if you want to be motivated to get your life back on track this is a great way to kick-start that process.  If you want to support a Black owned business that is uplifting and positive, this is a great purchase.  I am a true fan of this video and highly recommend it for you.

*Note: I do not work for Black Girls Workout Too.  I do not know the owners.  I have never been to the store. I simply made my purchase on Amazon.",1380672000,4,3370,4.025602409638554

5547636,4,B00B1DC1CA,I'm giving this a 4 star only because of the video editing. It is a bit choppy but aside from that the workouts are great. I had to turn a fan on because I started sweating in the first 30 seconds. Do not let the comments regarding the choppiness of the DVD deter you because you will still get a good workout.

I usually travel with the DBD in my car trunk so I don't make excuses to miss a workout.  I did take a week off and got right back to it last night.  I now have the basement at my man's house set-up as well so I can get my workout on... He took some time to hook up the DBD player and made a lot of noise about me invading his man cave but I know he will thank me in the end...... LOL!

5547684,4,B00B1DC1CA,"THIS IS PART ONE OF MY REVIEW.  PART TWO WILL BE REVIEWING THE MEAL PLAN AND PART THREE WILL BE MY RESULTS OF THE WHOLE PROGRAM

-NO there isn't a stretching segment but there is a cardio warm up session at the beginning.  Stretch on your own

-From there you'll then see Miss Ellen who also takes you through a series of  upper body workouts with some sort of cardio in between the sets.
-From the arm workout, you go directly into your lower body workout with Lana.  This segment is challenging but still is very doable.

- Once you finish the lower body , you'll head into the cardio /kickboxing part which will produce even more sweat .
***********>The 'cool down' point is basically just a 10 second countdown  for you to take a break and grab some water (you W I L L be sweating by that point). It does not signal a new work out.
I believe the program works best if you follow the dvd straight through from beginning to the end. <<*****************

-After that you'll be directed  back to Lana for more lower body exercises.  Not as many squats this time, but you will be targeting the muffin top area.

-The ab portion of the dvd is pure hell!!! You're gonna feel the burn and if you don't. you're doing something wrong.>>>(this segment is also where editing problems come in but it didn't bother me.  It wasn't as drastically bad as other people made it seem. It doesn't affect the actual workout<<<

-The work out ends with Miss Ellen and she basically takes you through  the last bit of upper body workouts and then you're done.

-I currently use the dvd 6 day/week (Monday-Saturday) and I also jog 2 miles everyday I use the dvd.

Overall I feel like the DVD is working for me so far.  The workouts are not demanding but they're not easy either.  I still struggle with not stopping throughout the dvd and I am a 21 year old active college student who attends the gym regularly .

-My opinion on the editing :  I almost let that stop me from buying this dvd but I opted to purchase it anyway and see it for myself.  I honestly feel like you ladies should do the same. I do feel like the editing could be slightly better but I also know that Gymnetics is an independently owned gym, and not a franchise. I chose this program because I wanted results and I saw real women getting them.
 I will be purchasing from Gymnetics again in the future

I must say with the dvd you will sweat alot but for me after the first four days I got bored with the workout.. I really love Mrs. Ellens boxing and ""roll out"" portion of the dvd but wish there was more time for the ab portion with Lana as well as a better meal plan.

5547725,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I purchased this even AFTER reading the reviews about the editing, and they are right. The editing is a bit funky in certain parts. it is not as bad as some folks are making it seem though, so don't be discouraged from purchasing because of that. (but maybe the price could be knocked down some for that) You can either work through it or take a quick break on those parts, no big deal. I LOVE supporting up and comers, locals etc, because it is a bit more real. They used ""fitness models"" that are REAL, not people who you cant relate to especially if you are a beginner. These girls look like they have worked out with ellen and lana for some time. My favorite parts are Lana on Squats and Abs and all the work Ellen does with the Dumbells with rows and upper body. The ONLY suggestions I have as an avid workout DVD user is that on the next DVD they could incorporate a little more instruction (visual and verbal) on proper form. They should mention a cool down and the importance of stretching if its not going to be included(But really though, stretching is common sense. Something else some of the reviewers should not be so upset about)And they should make sure the DVD is edited properly because it can throw timing off for those who like to work out at the same pace of the DVD. Over all, I work up a good sweat, and as long as that happens, Im happy! Oh! Meal plan, the meal plan is good, I wish it was written a little clearer,its just a little odd looking, compared to others I've seen, but I've been having fun learning different ways to eat the foods it requires and cant wait to send them before and after photos!",1378771200,,1628,4.288961038961039

5547801,5,B00B1DC1CA,"This is long but if you want an HONEST REVIEW!!! PLEASE READ ON....
Most of the reviews I have read are sad and way off topic.  The purpose of a review is to let potential buyers know if the product did what it said it would and was it hard, easy...etc.  I want to first start by saying it does not matter what pictures are on their instagram, twitter, or Facebook. These women obviously work hard for their money and they appear to be successful Entrepreneurs, smart enough to turn something they love and benefit from into a successful business.  I love it!!! Keep doing what you are doing. Thank God and keep it moving. I have tried numerous workout equipment, gym memberships, brazilin butt lift, insanity, P90 X, and plenty more over the years.  I will be thirty come October and this is the first DVD that has motivated me to continue with the workouts. By no means am I saying the other workout DVDs did not work but they did not keep me motivated.  The women behind GYMNETICS FITNESS ""spoke"" to me.  I can relate to them, they inspire me. As a customer who purchased this product it was not my job to critique the budget for the making of this DVD. Just like I said before if they are business women making a living, they need to be smart about expenses.  Ellen is 60 years old if the warm-ups work for her and she is doing it without injury, then bless your sad soul if you can't keep up with a 60 year old. And I usually don't even take the time to write reviews or respond to people who appear to be misinformed of a certain topic or just not educated enough.  It just really pissed me off to see all of these ridiculous comments discussed as ""product reviews"".  If Lana wants to look pretty & barely workout, that's her business. Because genetics couldn't even get her to be fit as she is now. She has to be maintaining that body and I say GO GIRL!!! You look great. You and your mother deserve all the blessing you are getting and may God bless you with much more. THESE Strong black women are changing lives and giving all races the power to fill beautiful.  SO I'm not going to keep going on & on, I just really dislike when people try to as I say hate on other peoples success.  Ellen & Lana keep being beautiful, healthy, and inspiring!! I love the DVD, the meal plans, advice, and everything you are doing.  I have lost weight, I feel better about myself, I am motivated, and I feel energized.  You have helped me reached my goal weight from 160lbs to 130lbs in a short period of time. It is not fair to try and put an exact date or day because I have not been consistent. I plan to keep using your DVD to maintain & stay toned & fit.  I am a single mother of two and I will continue to support anything you guys do because it is real and not just for show and I have my proof of that.",1377820800,5,2803,4.205223880597015
5547802,5,B00B1DC1CA,Lana and Ms. Ellen were my first personal trainers who got me started in the workout world back in 2009. I worked out w/ them for 2 mths ( 20 pound weight loss ).. I was skeptical about the DVD because of the complaints about sound and picture. I talked shit to my sister and said why the hell is it $29.99 and I believe ppl are being paid on Instagram to write good reviews (I'm just being honest)... But I had to think about it and say Kinzi you're wrong for thinking that these are the same women who helped you get 20 pounds off in person.. The DVD is great. I don't know what's wrong with y'all DVD players but I can hear Lana and Ms. Ellen just fine. Clearly some of y'all just need something to complain about. These women are great personal trainers and they get results so just buy the DVD reader .. Keep up the great work Vitamin C & Vitamin E ,1377820800,6,854,4.083333333333333

5547838,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Okay, I was very skeptical about buying the dvd because of some of the negative reviews, however, I decided to order it anyway. First, I understand what people were talking about when they were speaking about the editing of the video. There were continuity issues and until you get used to it, it can be pretty confusing. The DVD comes with a meal plan that reminds me of Dr. Ian's fat smash diet. I honestly couldn't make it past day two with the detox due to my sugar withdrawals. I have worked out with this DVD religiously and I have seen a change in my body despite the not using the meal plan, my stomach has gone down and my gluteus has rounded and firmed up a bit.

The thing I love the most about this DVD is that they don't have models with ""perfect shapes,"" these gals have made amazing transformations and look great, but again they aren't the typical fitness models that you see in every other workout DVD. It makes me feel more comfortable and that I can actually do this dvd. Speaking of the fitness models, one of the girls (I think her name was Roc) threw me off a bit because at times her form was horrible and it looked like someone who didn't really want to work out (she had a beautiful smile though). I had to try to tune her out a little and focus on the other girls in the other corner (I think they were Kristy and Larissa) because their form was great and they looked like they were there to work out.

Overall this DVD works if you put in the effort, I just wish the continuity and the lack of proper transitions didn't exist because it would make the DVD a lot better. I do accept the fact that this is their first DVD, so hopefully the next one will be a little better (maybe they were working with a very small budget). I often see the transformations on Instagram and personally know someone that followed the meal plan and did the DVD and their transformation was amazing. Honestly, if you're ready to get in shape, I still recommend this DVD, even with the negative points that I pointed out.",1377388800,8,2025,4.312335958005249

5547842,5,B00B1DC1CA,I love this workout and how they include a meal plan in with the dvd. Only thing is if you lose the meal plan and have proof of your purchase when you contact the company to see if you can get another company they will charge you for an email copy of the meal plan which I feel like is poor customer service. I should not have to pay for an email copy of a meal plan that I have already paid for in which I lost during a move. Other than that the dvd is nice and you can tell its their first DVD for those of us who purchase fitness DVDs on the regular.,1377129600,,553,3.7758620689655173

You can't please everyone but this dvd is worth the price, we are not in film editing class we are buying this to get healthy & get in shape Point, Blank period. The dvd fades out from mother to daughter both concentrating on different parts of the body, during that time you can pause the dvd & rest then continue. Yes the editing could have been better but for god's sake we are not retards sense will tell you that another segment is coming up plus it tells you what's coming up next on the screen so you have an idea that it's about to end soon.

Either it was half assed or not enough funding but the video wasn't what i thought it would be. If you take the video just for what it is and cater it to your needs, i guess it can work.

For me, the daughter's counts were off, so if I wasn't paying attention I would think she's done but they'd still have 2 more reps to go.  Otherwise than that, the workouts were really good.  The mom jumped right in there, got my heart rate up!  When my schedule permits I attend a karate aerobics class (which comprises of aerobics and boxing).  This video is in line with what I do in that class.  Now I don't have to feel guilty about missing the class, I can simply pop in the video and get the same kind of workout.

5547878,3,B00B1DC1CA,"I am in my 30's and have lost about 30 pounds with a combination of better eating and a variety of workouts over the last 6 months. I used to play basketball in college and for many years afterwards, but tore my Achilles. Therefore, I had to be smarter about the types I exercise I engage in. I have done the P90x and Insanity DVD's -- I like them both. I also like to pull workouts from Pinterest that are Crossfit focused or have a good mix of cardio/strength/abs. I heard good things from a few friends about this DVD and I saw the positive posts on Instagram. I was stunned that they claimed ladies were drastically losing weight with this DVD in as little as a month. So, I decided to purchase it.

Let me first say that Vitamin Ellen is great. I'm very impressed that she fully participated in the entire workout, while giving instruction. The same can't be said for her daughter. The pace is quick - too quick in some instances. Some exercises just stop and pick up again inexplicably. There isn't much in the way of explanation or transition between exercises, the counts are off and you can barely hear Lana speaking. During her segments, the music is so loud, it's supremely distracting. The production of the DVD is just really bad. Sometimes they tell you what they are doing, sometimes they don't. The ab segment is actually quite good. I had never done the windshield wiper ab set before - that was really very good. But, they cut away from the abs just as Lana said you needed to repeat the whole ab routine backwards! What is that?!!?

I like the content of the DVD, but I hate the production. But, I do think it's a good workout. After I did it 3 or 4 times and got the moves down, I actually put it on mute and started listening to my own music! I never listen to them anymore. You need to do your own warmup and stretch afterwards. The bottom line is this - it's great to see black women in the fitness game - there aren't that many. But, I truly don't understand how this DVD made it out of post-production without them being horrified at the technical issues.

I expected more for $30. You're never disappointed with any Beachbody workout DVD. Hopefully their next DVD will be a little more polished!",1375920000,3,2221,4.399026763990268
5547879,3,B00B1DC1CA,"First let me say I do not work out at all which is why I purchased this dvd Black Girls Workout Too. I purchased insanity a few months ago and it was super hard for me. I did it for 2 days and quit. Those were the worst 2 days. So anyway I watched some clips of this dvd on youtube and it didn't look so hard so I ordered it. When the dvd starts it has before and after photos. That was annoying to me. I had to fast forward the dvd to get to the workout. The before and afters should have been at the end of the dvd. Once I got to the dvd part the music was so loud you could barely hear ellen or her daughter talking. I read the editing was bad but omg how could they release the dvd like this? So now the work out starts. Even for me, it was extremely easy. The hardest parts for me were the parts with the daughter. She does the squats, the leg exercises, and abs. Ellens parts of the dvd are very easy however she is like dripping sweat and Im moving as fast as she is. The girls in the background look extremely bored during the workout. Overall the workout for a beginner like me is pretty good once you get past the editing issues. I did not do the meal plan because Im on the Atkins diet. So I couldn't tell you how that went. Ive only done the workout twice. I'll uodate this in a few weeks.",1375833600,2,1301,3.8947368421052633

5547885,3,B00B1DC1CA,"I really love supporting a Black workout program and the upbeat personalities of both women make it fun and you forget how long it takes you. However there are a few things that could be improved. There are several words spelled incorrectly (e.g., giggle for jiggle) and the dvd has abrupt editing.  Like the mom will say we are going to do more but it cuts off to the daughter. The cooldown is 10 seconds long and there is no good stretching at the beginning or end.  Also it is not very difficult at all. However the workouts do cover a lot of ground and I have a fun time doing.

5547901,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I have this DVD. Yes the editing is HORRIBLE!! No, it should not be $30..It looks like a DVD you would buy from the bootleg guy who sells DVDs out of his car. The video is about 42 minutes. Maybe 35 min of workout. A lot of bloopers. It should really be on clearance because of that. It's like they were working out and said hey lets record while we workout -_- BUT the workout is great!! You will be tired and may not be able to finish if you're just starting out. I've had the DVD for months but I am just now about to seriously stick with it. But yes the pricing should be much lower because it seriously is not professionally shot nor edited.. I would recommend spending your $30 on other exercising videos but since I have it, I will continue to use it. Yes I am all for support, but I am also for quality products if I am going to spend my money. And the meal plan isn't anything special.. It's pretty basic.",1375315200,6,914,4.111731843575419

I seen people complaining about the editing. Well that doesn't take away from the fact that the DVD actually helps! I love the fact that black women went and did something positive rather it is perfect or not. The meal plan has been difficult for me because I hate veggies, my mom loves veggies but she didn't like the soup. So I have done most of the meal plan minus the veggies for the first week. My biggest area is my mid-section and thighs, and but. I have a huge butt bc every woman in my family has it, but I rather tone up. The ab section of the video is hard for me bc my lower half is so heavy and the leg lifting tires me out. BUT I complete it, and even if I can't do everything that Lana does in that part, I sub it for more crunches or bicycles. This DVD is great. I don't know why so many people have such bad reviews for it. If you're not losing it's because you're not doing something right! You have to follow the plan as best as you can, eat smaller meals, cut out meats and junk food! I'm glad that this video was done. The best 45 min workout I've ever done. Sometimes I do it twice a day. Depends on how tired I am from dealing with my 8 month old. What I hate is people who try to discourage others from trying something new that can help them. You have to remember that if you're really obese, you're not going to see results as fast as someone smaller than you. YOu didn't gain all that weight overnight, or in a week. Dont expect to meet your goal and lose it all overnight or in a week!",1374624000,5,1666,4.021084337349397

5547959,4,B00B1DC1CA,"While the DVD does produce results and the work outs are great, I must say it needs some serious editing moving forward.  At times the ladies' voices are either inaudible or completely gone due to the music.  There are also a few glitches where the caption on the bottom of the screen may introduce the next exercise only to find something else is being shown.  There are also a lot of cuts, for instance one of the ladies may be speaking or counting reps and then the DVD is cut and it may start the rep over or go somewhere else in the taping. Even with those glitches, I still say it's worth the money.  The bottome line is results.  The DVD does what it promises and I love the booklet that comes with the DVD.",1374451200,,714,4.220588235294118

The ladies in the back are real and relateable. No dramatic results initially but there are definitely changes. I have no reservations that this DVD will get me where I need to be. As many have mentioned ,I did not give a 4 because of editing but I understand this was their first venture. I am sure the next one will correct this. This is a minor inconvenience compared to the workout you get. Kudos ladies;)!",1372809600,,580,4.330275229357798

I understand some of the complaints people have with the editing of the video. However, if you can over look that for the quality of the workout, I'm sure you will be pleased. I was surprised at how many calories I was able to burn with the workout being low impact and the how fast the video went. Some workout dvd's seem to be extra long. I worked up a good sweat and my arms and thighs are feeling stronger already. I am currently on week two of the workout and lost 7 lbs my first week (following the detox stage) It's a great workout for starters and those who are advanced in working out. Good luck to you all!!",1372809600,9,752,4.087837837837838
5548044,5,B00B1DC1CA,"Wow, I can't believe all of the negativity up here. That is why we as a people can't have nice things. Anyway, I bought this DVD after my friend showed me all of the before/after pics on Instagram. I have already lost about 80 lbs. on my own in the last 15 months. I'm on my last 15-20 lbs. and wanted to get them off and to tone up! I am not a beginner but not advanced either. This workout did make me sweat and I was sore the next day. The cleanse isn't bad at all and I might extend it to two weeks. I don't like the cabbage soup but LOVE the chili!!! I like the fact that the toning is done with bursts of cardio in between to keep your heart rate up. I also like the fact that this is encouraging black women to get up and move. Yes, the production/editing sucks, but if you can get past that and just do the moves you will see results. And for all the exercise physiologists up here commenting on the lack of stretching, you aren't supposed to stretch cold muscles. The warm up at the beginning is sufficient. I add my own stretches at the end. I hope these ladies come out with another DVD soon!",1372723200,8,1103,4.041095890410959

Im only 5'0 feet & 133lbs i didn't want to lose weight just tone my body & it did just that!! By doing the squats and lunges it lifted my butt and curved my legs the right way! I love that part of the DVD. The ab part could be a little longer but from my experience so far...it works for me. I don't follow the meal plan I just watch what I eat & work out about 3-4 times a week. I love the way my body looks from this DVD its giving me all the curves in all the right place but still keeping my healthy...this DVD is the truth!!!,1372636800,4,623,3.656716417910448

5548109,3,B00B1DC1CA,"I'am going to be honest about this dvd. its not worth the 30 dollars. the sound is horrible, the editing is just as bad. and before anyone says who cares about the editing its the work out that counts. well I this case it does matter. the editing affects the workout because they are telling you do two more and its not so. the count is off during certain movements. you end up doing more reps on one side then the other. the mother does all the movements which is good but her daughter hardly does any of what she is telling you to do. I did this dvd for about a month for 5 days every week, I got some results but not like what other people claim they were getting. I eat right and drink a gallon of water everyday. so on that note, this dvd needs to be 19.99 and I still think that's to high but what ever. you don't have to agree with what im saying but im being honest.",1372291200,6,874,4.0

 I can't give too much feedback on the exercises because I only saw about 4 seconds every 5 minutes but I will say that based on what I heard (yea, I sat and listened to the dvd while it blacked out) it isn't worth half of thirty dollars. I'll continue to give my money to Jillian Michaels (the 90 day workout and professionally done meal plan was worth the 100).

Even with the poor reviews I wanted to give this dvd a try to support the black girls workout too movement but I am extremely disappointed to admit that it seems to be another ploy to rip off people. Be real- telling someone u studied the black womans DNA to create this workout sounds dumb and ignorant. They studied their followers and the women they knew to see that they wanted hips and a butt (squats) and flat abs (crunches).

I have NEVER received results with any other Workout DVD as FAST and Effective as I did with this one.  I'm a black woman with hips, butt and curves and it toned me in all the right places while burning fat where needed.  I blocked out the minor issues with editing skips and also used my previous exercise experiences to know to stretch before and after every workout.  Although I agree with the editing.  I still believe it was worth the money.  The moves were just enough to give you a challenge but not enough to make you feel like you can't do it.  If you want results, I say give it a try.  Go to INSTAGRAM and see before and after pics! That's all I needed to decide it was worth the buy.  People are paying Monthly Memberships at Gyms with Instructors teaching them what to do and still are NOT getting what they are paying for. LOL! Are you asking for a DISCOUNT?!?! I follow on instagram and I'm Thankful to Lana and Ellen for trying to get us Motivated to Workout! I'm sure in time, they will improve!

I understand some of the low ratings about the sound and editing, I think this needs to be improved. There was not a cool down and It skipped to different scenes! I really like their plan, but no bootleg video please!",1371340800,,382,4.319444444444445

5548225,2,B00B1DC1CA,"The videos concept is good.  The delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  Ellen is obviously the trainer and the talent.  Lana is unfortunately just eye candy.  She is a beautiful young lady but she disturbs my workout with her loud voice, false enthusiasm and she doesn't work out on the WORK OUT video (ok she sways her hips and does maybe 20 squats). Ellen stays on par with you the whole process.  She motivated me and my niece.  You felt like if she can do it i can to!  Editing SUCKED! Too many errors to list.  All in all Ellen saves this video from bring sent flying towards the garbage like a Carmen Electra workout dvd.  This video is not worth buying, if you have s friend who'll let you copy it to your apple tv or whatever free option go with thAt.",1370995200,7,758,4.208333333333333

5548251,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I found BGWT on instagram, from following lana and wanted to give it a try. I started the diet immediately with the workout video. The workout is definitely intense and after doing squats and sit ups I was sore! :) That made me a happy gal! lol I'm not sure what technical problems others had with their DVD's, but mine worked fine. I could hear them and there was no skipping. The only thing I can agree to with some other reviews, is that sometimes ellen or lana would say 10 more reps and actually do like 12 (oh well, no biggie to me!) I honestly was unsure if I should get the DVD, because a lot of people were complaining about it. But, honestly it is GREAT & I haven't finished my 30days yet, but so far I have lost 3in off my waist and I continue to loose weight. The diet really helps you shed those pounds. I must admit though, I was very fatigued, had headaches and a few minor symptoms from the detox. But, it worked great. I ate the soup 3x's that week and ate tons of fruit and vegetables and by the time I could eat meat I was so thrilled. I hope whoever is reading this really purchases this DVD, because I would do it over again in an instant!

Honest customer!",1370736000,40,1178,4.14410480349345

5548253,5,B00B1DC1CA,Easy to follow 45 mins a day is nothing compared to the results I've gotten. You'd think I'd been working out everyday for hour but all I did was workout with this DVD and follow the eating plan 5 weeks later 15lbs down.,1370736000,,220,4.1395348837209305

5548286,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I like this dvd, It has good workouts and it gets you moving. The only thing I don't like about the dvd is how much things repeat especially when you get to the lower body workouts I need to see a little more variety but I have seen improvement with excersizes I added on and the meal plan is pretty good it's a basic detox of your system which causes majority of the weight loss",1370390400,2,379,4.066666666666666

5548288,4,B00B1DC1CA,"The ONLY thing wrong with this DVD is the production and editing. It is poor. But if you look beyond that and focus on the content, you'll love this kick-ass program. If you don't already workout be warned, the warm up will get you. Follow the Ectors on Instagram. They interact with you on there and keep you motivated. Again, just focus on the content of the video. Hopefully they'll make another one that's better in production quality.",1370390400,,439,4.641025641025641

5548290,3,B00B1DC1CA,The bad editing makes it not worth the price. Aside from that you will get a good workout. The squats portion is the best part. If they lower the price to 15 then it will be worth the price.,1370217600,,190,3.8974358974358974
5548291,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I ordered this DVD after months of consideration and following the instagram accounts of Vitamin Ellen and Lanagem---the results from the video on IG were astounding but after completing the workout I must agree with some of the other reviews, the quality of the sound and transitions between the workouts suck. It is somewhat difficult to follow because some of the excercises seem to be cut short and if you're like me, I'm in beast mode and prefer a continuous work out when following a video. It seems like they did the editing themselves or allowed someone with little to NO experience do it. One minute it says cool down however the next segment is boxing....the workout itself is not extremely challenging unless you don't work out period (I do turbofire, insanity and P90X but still struggled with the large amount of squats). I am all about supporting black businesses but the price of $30.00 was outrageously high for the product. I will however purchase from them in the future but I hope the editing improves drastically!",1370217600,2,1033,4.84180790960452
5548292,4,B00B1DC1CA,"I liked the DVD very much.  It needs to be more detailed, some women don't know how to do certain exercises properly.  There should be a demonstration before each excercise or at the beginning of the tape.  Otherwise its great.",1370217600,,227,4.625

But I continued to workout because I love it and love the way working out makes me feel physically, psychologically, emotionally, just all aspects. But four weeks ago when I learned about this DVD, not really expecting change because they all make promises.  However, I am now 3 dress sizes smaller, from a 12/14 to a loose 8!!  You can see the weight loss all in my face, arms, legs, I feel great!! I am so grateful to God for Ms. Ellen and Lana!! Can't wait to meet them!",1370217600,2,610,4.4774774774774775

The squats hurt my knees so I omitted them from the workout until I get to a trainer who can properly show me how to do them.

Overall, this is a great at home workout for those who are looking to get down to business fast. Lost 7 pounds in the first week, along with the meal plan. So yeah, I am a believer.",1370044800,3,475,4.10752688172043

5548331,5,B00B1DC1CA,"I bought this DVD due to the inspiring before and after photos posted on Instagram as well as curiosity. I've had it for almost a month now and I LOVE it! Is the video a little rough around the edges? Yes. Could the editing and pricing be a bit better? Yes. But with that being said, the routine is solid from start to finish. I'm dripping sweat after about 11 minutes and I feel that wonderful after workout burn the next day. I have almost all of Jillian Michaels DVD's, as well as P90X, and I find that this one fits nicely in my rotation. I haven't used the meal plan, which appears to be a remix of something I've seen in Dr. Ian's Fat Smash books, but I have lost about 8 - 10lbs and inches during the month of May working out with this 3 times per week and walking. I am a bit disappointed that there is only one routine on the DVD, but other than that I'm excited about it! Vitamin Ellen is engaging and keeps your heart rate up throughout her portions and Lana Ector is just about equally engaging although her intensity seems a bit lower for some reason.",1369958400,,1064,4.195121951219512
5548332,3,B00B1DC1CA,Overall the workout is great. I use it along with my strength training and regular cardio.  I must say for this price the editing could have been better.  The editing and the sound is horrible. Workouts cut into each other and there are a couple of times when the workout has begun and it starts over again.,1369958400,,307,4.368421052631579

They know EXACTLY what us african american women like as far as the booty tone up and getting rid of our ""saddle bags"" lol I can totally relate to this worout.

What I don't get, is how all this big woman lose so much inches in 3-4 weeks with this weak workouts. You only get 5-7 mins of AB workout. The daughter is VERY annoying, just walking around passing orders in her squeaky voice, she did like 2 squats and was already out of breath, so I'm guessing she didn't workout for that body, she got it from good  genes.

5548468,3,B00B1DC1CA,"instagram and other social networks make this product seem like its the ultimate fitness dvd for women, but after purchasing it i quickly realized that this was just another half ass product on the shelf. These women are personal trainers and majority of the before and after pictures are of people who live in Atlanta and personally come to their gym for group one on one training. i'm sure they didn't obtain their slim waistlines and toned arms from simply doing this workout. I've completed a full round of insanity and in comparison there is none. first and foremost the editing on this video is terrible. second, they have no transitions and the video seems to jump from one workout to another without prompting you. the warm up was fine but the rest of the workout seemed to be very minimal. The daughters portion was hurting my ears from all the yelling she was doing. i wish that instead of talking she would have been working. i also personally do not find interest in doing the same routine over and over and over again. this program is designed to be 30 days but again in comparison to other fitness dvds why would you not incorporate different workouts throughout the weeks? i feel like this program is more so about you getting your diet together rather than the fitness aspect. they include a pamphlet with a meal plan and it seems as though without following their strict diet your results will decrease significantly. i found the meal plan a little unrealistic. they want you to go without any meat for the first week and then they give you very few options for food the next 3 weeks. they gave two recipes which were okay but again, in comparison to other dvds, why would you only have two choices? this is suppose to set you up for success but as a person who's been there done that before i find that this program would be hard to stick to. my advice to them would be to try again. id support their business if they re-worked the dvd and really gave us the tools THEY use for success. this dvd is half ass made and i guess you get what you pay for. its only $30 but people like me would rather spend $100 and get a professional program that guarantees results.",1368662400,5,2180,4.466165413533835

5548471,2,B00B1DC1CA,I found the video to be of poor quality as well as the work out being basic.  Basically they repeated the same exercise over and over.  Very disappointed.,1368662400,23,154,4.464285714285714

5548499,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Okay, so, if you click on the reviews that give this video five stars, ironically enough, you will see that this is the only review these people have ever written.  While that could be the case for some, there is no way that all of these great reviews are real. Especially when they don't go into details about what they liked about the DVD.  I hate fake reviews, because people like me actually read reviews before buying products. Please listen to the reviews that give the DVD between 2-3 stars, because that is more realistic.  The women are wonderful.  It's motivating to finally have a DVD that features all Black women. That alone makes me want to do the workout.  The overall workout itself is somewhat challenging and enjoyable.  After you get over the editing issues, you can really turn this into a good workout.  However, as everyone else has stated, the transitions are choppy (which can throw you off-for example, they will say 10 more reps, but it will be more like 15 more...or they will say 10 squats and it will be 1...that's just poor editing and lack of experience), the editing is poor, and the production is extremely lacking.  There is no cooldown, the boxing is weak and a four-year-old could do it, and the counting is off.  Lana walks around with weave to her butt, explaining the workouts, but barely doing them.  Kudos to Ellen for actually dong the workouts.  The best parts of the workout are the squat series and leg work with Lana (that is well worth it) and the rowing machine section with Ellen (you will feel it).  They could have added an actual warm-up, transitioned between exercises, and ended with a cooldown and some stretches, which ALL workouts do.  The ab workout is actually over-the-top and completely undoable for a beginner.  The meal plan is solid, but I can't help wondering why they stole Dr. Ian Smith's Fat Smash diet and passed it off as their own.  Also, the soup recipe has no directions and the ingredients size is enough to make soup for an entire army (when I made it, I had to give half of it to my co-workers, it was that much). Finally, they recommend doing the same workout every day.  Any one who has ever exercised before knows that you shouldn't work the same muscles two days in a row.  When you strength train, you are tearing muscle fibers, and they need time to heal.  Doing this workout every day, especially without a cool down and stretches, can lead to boredom, injury, or worse. When you go on Instagram, there are so many before and after pictures of women who claim to have lost weight with the mother-daughter duo, however, if you go to that person's page, you will learn that they actually attended sessions at their gym and that's how they lost the weight.  If I lived in Atlanta, I would join their gym ASAP and get into shape, because it is obvious that they know what they're doing.  However, I do not feel that they have put their best effort into this DVD.  I can overlook all of this for maybe $19.99, but not for $30.  For $30, I expect the editing to be perfect and the DVD to be a complete package.  It's sad that there are so few products geared towards Black women that we have to resort to this.  With that begin said, if you stick to the meal plan and you find a way to make the DVD work for you (get over the poor editing, and add your own cool down and stretches) I do believe that this could help you lose weight.  I do not want to give up on it, but I would like to see them remake this DVD into a better product, because it has the potential to be great.",1368489600,486,3552,4.402756508422665

5548501,3,B00B1DC1CA,"Not a penny more.  As far as production quality - if you told me this was shot with a cell phone, it'd make perfect sense.  If you told me it was shot with your father's camcorder from 10 years ago - I'd understand.  In my DVD player it skips a few minutes at a time like crazy.  On my macbook pro, it plays without problem.  The thing is - I shouldnt have to do this.  For 9.99 I'd say ""welp, you get what you pay for.""  At $30 I'm planning on returning it.  As far as the workout (yes, one single.. lone.. solitary workout) - all I've got is ""its okay"".  The only thing I'll take away is the variety of squats and a seated row with the weights.  I did enjoy the style (switching back and forth) - but the transitions (between mom & daughter and between individual exercises) aren't even smooth.  Congrats to the duo, but I will be looking to return this video and begin searching for an alternative.

5548587,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Ok, so I got this DVD because a friend of mine got it and you could see her results within a week. When I looked at the price I thought to myself this is way too much for a 45 min DVD and a half-a** meal plan. Even though it was too much I still purchased. I brought everything I needed for the meal plan and I started the DVD the following Monday. To my surprise I lost 10 lbs in the first week of it. After the first week the exercise just simply became boring to me. I think for the prices that was paid they could at least gave us an whole hour. Like I stated before the DVD is 45 mins. Let me break down the 45 mins though: the exercising itself is on 30 mins long if that long. They ""testimonials"" are 5-10mins long. And they talk for the rest. The quality really needs to be worked on a few of their back-up exercise ladies were totally lost when exercising and one even just stops in the middle. The transitions from exercise to exercise is horrible! Besides all that I would still recommend this to friends. You get super fast results the cabbage soup is delicious and if you follow them on twitter and or IG they do give encouraging messages. It makes you feel as though they know you personally. I am starting the meal plan over and doing the Detox next I am so close to having my beach body it's scaring me. I love the DVD I just wish the quality matched the price, I will say though you'll forget about the price once people start telling you you're losing weight one week after you've started.",1368144000,,1507,4.146757679180888

There are moments in the video when I can't hear a single instruction because the music overpowers the facilitator. I thought the problem lied in my DVD player, but once I tried both, I realized the flaw lied in the product. The exercises are, for the most part, easy to follow, however. There are sections where I need to know what is being said in order to catch the next movement, but most of it is intuitive after the first set. Overall, I'm going to use it because I paid $30 for it, but I will also supplement this workout with something more consistent.

I saw the great results online and decided to try this video. The first day I did it I felt like I wasted my money. It moves at a slower rate than what I'm used to. However, I decided to mute the video and just follow along with my own music at a faster rate. I mde it more intensed and didn't stop between segments. I constantly kept moving. Now I feel like I have maximized the intensity of their workout and now do it 2 days a week. I incorporate other workouts on other days. My favorite part of the video are the abs, lunges and squats!",1367798400,2,660,3.9328358208955225

Ladies if you want to stop putting off that weight loss get this dvd! From boxing to squats to cardio I know I will see results. I'm opting out of the meal plan but if you're up for it they have attached a 30 day meal plan. But  overall this is one of the best workout dvds I own. Afterwards I'm so sore but its a good sore.

5548719,5,B00B1DC1CA,I have had this dvd a couple of weeks now and I must say that I do really like it. The meal plan is easy to follow but u just need the willpower to go thru the first week. I think with consistent workouts you will see a difference.,1367625600,,231,3.7346938775510203
5548720,3,B00B1DC1CA,"The workout for the most part is very good. Some areas more challenging than others. Love the squat, lunge, abs, and row boat sections.

I love the fact that it came with a meal plan and grocery suggestions for healthy meal planning. I ordered my DVD from the original Gemnetics site. I talked about it so much that my aunt tried mine and wanted one too. I then ordered hers from Amazon. Subsequently I've raved about so much that a few friends and co-workers have purchased the DVD as well. Ms Ellen and Lana are passionate about what they do and it shows in the DVD!

I read the reviews and knew there were some editing issues so I wasn't all that surprised when I noticed them.

5548799,4,B00B1DC1CA,The work out is great. I think the diet portion could be a little clearer. If you try to reach them with any questions you won't get any response. The voicemail box is always full and they don't respond to emails. So as long as you don't have any questions about the GFMP then you will love it.,1367193600,,294,4.086206896551724

5548839,4,B00B1DC1CA,this dvd wasn't what I expected but I still broke a sweat. The cueing sucks. The daughter is extremely loud and the mom keeps looking at what is going on behind the scenes and no the camera. Some of the shots were off. Hopefully their next dvd will be better. May let someone who is an expert at camera shoots do it. The workout wasn't that bad. The editing just was UGH. This is an 10 to 15 dollar vid not 30.

5548857,5,B00B1DC1CA,"Update: it's been over a year and i am still using this video. I have tried other videos like Jillian Michaels and Taebo... But nothing works every part of my body like BGWOT. I invested in a heart rate monitor and found that I can burn 490 to 530 calories depending if I slack off or if I push it the whole time. I see people reviews don't reflect the effectiveness of the work out but more so the quality of editing. I'm not looking for a perfect video and excellent editing, I'm looking for a video that will burn more calories than a 40 minute jog and this does it for me and many of my friend. Yes it is a little price but to me an extra few dollars to make a difference then I'm with it. These lady's have don't a great job with their video and I will be purchasing any other DVDs they have to offer.**************************I love this workout DVD!

It's a full body workout. It can be quite intense but I appreciate it. I am a beginner and this is great. It really inspires me and I know MANY women who have stuck to the meal plan and workout and have seen results in 30 days. Great purchase!",1366675200,,419,4.0602409638554215

5548863,3,B00B1DC1CA,"A friend of mine told me about these ladies and I thought that I would give it a try.

Pros- you will sweat and feel the burn (during week 1)

Cons- the price
-there is no stretching involved in the video. Have to do that on your own
- there are several areas where the editing is an issue ie. Lana says ""ok two more"" and then the video jumps to another view and you end up doing 10 more. At one point you hear a cell phone!

I have been doing it for almost 2 weeks now and I do see a bit of a change but I can't see myself doing the exact same routine for 30 days straight like some women have claimed to have done. I would recommend doing this in addition to some other form of exercise.

I understand what they are trying to do. Heck, it got this black girl working out, but it just needs some tweaking and maybe more varieties of exercise, like a day 1 and day 2 exercise with stretches for the price.",1366588800,6,905,3.92896174863388
5548864,5,B00B1DC1CA,Great motivation for me and my daughter and easy to understand and workout to!!!! Will recommend to all nationality!!!! Take your time and get busy!!!!,1366588800,,151,5.08
5548885,5,B00B1DC1CA,I love the kickboxing cardio and ab workout. Those squats are something serious!!! i would definately recommend to my friends,1366588800,,125,5.3

5548889,5,B00B1DC1CA,The DVD is cool.  I don't really use it.  It's not for everyone the whole aerobics thing.  But I know if I really were to use it.  It would work perfectly.  I brought per the reviews from Instagram.  I got the package in a timely fashion.  I'd recommend this to those who are really serious about their workouts.  I also watch YouTube and get excellent workouts from there.,1366502400,,373,4.382352941176471
5548890,4,B00B1DC1CA,I immediately popped the DVD into the player.  I underestimated the intensity of this workout video.  I had to take a break lol.  Good workout.  Definitely a keeper in my workout regimen.,1366502400,,187,4.75
5548891,5,B00B1DC1CA,"I don't care about the editing or any of the other pointless and trivial posts made here to deter people from purchasing this DVD. The only thing necessary to follow along is common sense and you WILL get the results your looking for. Once you've done it twice you pretty much know what's coming next anyway. I have been on the meal plan & workout for a week and a half and I'm down 8 pounds. I RECOMMEND this to anybody that is WILLING and READY for a lifestyle change. I lost 50 pounds on the HCG diet but it was very restricting, this isn't and it is VERY doable. You just have to WANT to do it.",1366502400,5,598,4.076271186440678

The music is upbeat, and the audio for them talking is low so all you have to concentrate on is to keep pushing yourself. I enjoyed this workout, and continue to use it!",1366416000,,341,4.181818181818182
5548893,4,B00B1DC1CA,So I ordered my dvd on thurs and received it Fri afternoon. I did the workout twice now and I must say I really like it. It's a great total body workout. The sound wasn't terrible like most people spoke about. I could hear the instructions pretty well and it could be because I played it in my lap top and worked out. The transitions from one exercise to the next could have been a little smoother. Also the daughter could have worked out a little harder vs standing around acting cute and instructing everyone else. I appreciated the fact that the mom did every exercise. All in all I still think the exercises are great to target the areas black women need most help in. Can't wait to start seeing results.,1366416000,5,708,4.371212121212121
5548894,5,B00B1DC1CA,Love love love this dvd. Only been doin it for 3weeks as of this Monday comin and I love that I've drop about 15 lbs already... thanks ladys,1366416000,,140,4.035714285714286
5548935,5,B00B1DC1CA,This work-out dvd duo is really good. I truely love it its not like anything I've done before you will be honestly sweating no more then 10 mins into the dvd. It is well worth the money and the best part is that it includes a meal plan!!!,1366329600,,238,3.9791666666666665
5548936,2,B00B1DC1CA,I wanted to love this video after my friends raved about it. Once I saw it I was amazed at how poorly the editing was done. I also think it's a bit tacky to have a workout video where the daughter's butt gets zoomed in and she's working out with weave down to her butt. Are you serious? The mom looks like she put 100% into what she was doing. I really wish they had put more into editing. The workout itself was low intensity for me but I did love the ab and strength training.

5548937,5,B00B1DC1CA,"Perhaps they reviewed some of the complaints and edited the DVD , they have a cool down in the middle of the DVD, when they switch up sets they announce it,AND the sound was fine(but it wouldnt have mattered to me because i put on my own music while working out anyway).The DVD is fast paced but guess what thats how its supposed to be, move that body ladies!!!! I only had a issue with the price $30, then I set back and thought about how I would spend $30 bucks at the bar on drinks ,that I would pee right out, like it was nothing..... at least with this DVD the $30  price tag has a return if you work hard. I love seeing brown faces working out and doing something to make us better , I enjoy the workout and Im excited to see how I will look in a month. #BlackGirlsWorkOutTOO <3",1366329600,4,784,4.058064516129032

5548941,5,B00B1DC1CA,"After seeing the success people had with this DVD on instagram I decided to give it a try. OMG, this 30 day meal plan 40 minute daily workout has changed me in ways unimaginable!! I can fit into clothes that I haven't worn in over 10 years!! I've been working on myself for the past year and have tried several different dvds but none gave me results like this one did. My stomach has finally gone down! No its not a six pack but i'm getting there. Today is my last day of the 30 day and when its over i'm doing the whole thing over again!!! This time i'm actually looking forward to the 9 day detox!! This meal plan has really changed my eating habits. I love foods that i would have never eaten had it not been for that detox stage. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get in shape and feel great in as little as 30 days. I'm in love with the new me.

5548965,2,B00B1DC1CA,I was extremely excited to finally purchase my DVD because it was out of stock for a couple of weeks.  I did my workout today I enjoyed the workout but the sound quality is horrible.  I couldn't hear anything they were saying.  I have a hard time understanding why they would release a DVD with such poor quality.  Get it together ladies.,1366156800,3,338,4.403225806451613

5548973,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I don't really like this dvd at all... I was excited to receive it, like everyone else, because of the hype on instagram, but I hate the workout and have only done it twice. It is not difficult at all and the editing is horrible. I was very excited about the meal plan, but google divas can cook cabbage soup and you'll find the same recipe, and how to make it since they don't tell you in the meal plan. I love Ellen but this dvd is not the business... I did lose about 6 pounds in a week though, but I was eating the soup and doing my Turbo Fire dvds lol. I wouldn't waste my $30...",1366070400,5,584,3.957627118644068
5548974,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Ok...So I'm not a work-out junkie and I haven't owned a whole bunch of workout dvd's but this one to me is working and THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS! For people that are complaining about no stretch or cool down I guess common sense doesn't exist and you can't do it yourself I stretch before I start and when I'm done because I know that as a human being and because I am working my muscles everyday they will be sore so I reduce the soreness by stretching and a cool down for me normally includes me walking in place while listening to music. They can't hold your hand every step of the way people! You only paid $30!

I would agree that the editing isn't the best but if you are getting the results you want...the reason you bought the DVD why should it matter??? If you bought it for edits and music and cool-down then obviously you got the wrong DVD. I hope they do learn from the mistakes of this DVD so the next one will have less mistakes will be made. Personally the mistakes don't bother me cause it shows me this was a real workout for them not some edited video to look all pretty. Working out is not supposed to be pretty its supposed to be dirty! But when the next one comes out I will be purchasing it because when I do the workouts consistently they work and at the end of the day THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS!",1366070400,58,1317,4.14453125
5549025,3,B00B1DC1CA,"The DVD itself is intense as it states, but the backround music is so loud you can't hear the instructions. The editing of the DVD is poor and for the price I paid its just annoying. For as much advertising and popularity this DVD has you'd think they'd want to have the very best quality product. Once you get past the technical aspects of it the exercises are defintiely helpful.",1366070400,2,381,4.457142857142857
5549026,5,B00B1DC1CA,"This DVD is AWESOME! It really works the trouble areas of the 'Curvy' woman. It's not too intense, doesn't require a whole lot of jumping around and extremely heavy weights.

5549027,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I got this video very excited, but there is basically no cardio and the only thing that it really works for is squats? which i do anyway by myself with out spending 30$
Very poor quality
The DVD does not let you know amounts of reps
just skips around
Very unorganized",1365984000,11,267,4.254901960784314

5549029,1,B00B1DC1CA,"This video is not what I thought. So I'm going to agree with a bunch of the other ladies most of whom seem to have owned more professional workout videos before. The transitions are horrible, the sound is lacking, and the daughter does none of her own workouts. The an portion of the DVD is cut off right in the middle, then it just jumps into another part. The camera angles are all off and the music is too loud. I did feel a burn the next day, but it's mostly because all of the draughts portion is squats. Which means, I paid $30 to do 100 squats...I was doing tht before. I am not a fan of the meal plan. It is way to strict, which I'm sure you know is a set up for failure. If u deprive yourself tht much you are sure to lose. So far I have only been doing it for a week, so if I see any real results maybe my view will change, buy for now, I think the price is too high for what they are selling.",1365984000,21,903,3.860215053763441

5549031,4,B00B1DC1CA,"Ok, I took no pictures, but I did black girls work out too for 1 month and lost 12 lbs, I am a very bad ""dieter"" so being put on a strict detox did not work for me , but I did it for 2 1/2 days until I couldn't take any more fruits and cabbage soup anymore, but i decided to stick to a 5 fruit 5 vegatable a day serving along with my regular meals. I never went over 1500 calories a day and I kept junk food out, I did the workout 5 days a week and I did not do any cheat days. I lost 2 pants sizes went from an 18-16. My arms are toning and so are my thighs and butt. Im happy with my results and I will keep using the system.",1365811200,,627,3.5179856115107913

5549033,2,B00B1DC1CA,"After seeing amazing results on IG, I bought this video. Its a black mother && daughter team so I def wanted to show support. The women who had drastic results were women who NEVER dieted && worked out before so of course if you diet && do some type of cardio you're going to lose weight. THIS IS NOT A MIRACLE DVD. I work out daily so the first time I did this DVD I was able to complete it. I did feel the burn but again there's nothing special about it. The editing IS HORRIBLE looks like my 6 year old did it && I know they noticed this before this DVD was put out! If you're going to do something put 100% into it not 80%... The daughter (Lana) is working out with 30 inch flat ironed hair like really WHO DOES THAT! Is it a work out video or a look at my hair and makeup while I only do 2 reps of this Workout video.... There's only ONE workout that you're suppose to do EVERYDAY && anybody that works out knows you can't work the same muscles out EVERYDAY you need some type of muscle confusion. So if you're not use to working out && you buy this you WILL lose weight but if you are advanced in working out then I would recommend not purchasing this. It's def overpriced && under developed. They should tape a few of their work out classes && put THAT on DVD. I almost wanted to send it back && get my money back but I'm just going to keep it since I'm showing ""support"". :-)",1365811200,9,1383,4.0144927536231885

It's hard with out feeling like you are going to die (I'm not one of those p90x or Insanity lovers- I like to get a good sweat without needing to go to the hospital midway through). My heart monitor said I burned about 500 calories after doing the entire video, which is a pretty good burn. I definitely feel like everything is getting tighter.

The mom is very motivating and you can tell she know her stuff. The daughter tries to kill you with those squats (LOL)!! Yes some of the editing is choppy but by Day 3, you basically have the routine memorized and you need the music to take your mind off the pain! I lost 7 pounds in 7 days and that's with not following the meal plan completely (I hate cabbage and chilli), but  I did lay off the meat and I feel and look a whole lot better.

5549081,2,B00B1DC1CA,"This DVD has the worst editing I have ever seen! It seriously seems like it was thrown together. For thirty dollars I should at least get a DVD with some quality editing! In all honesty this DVD is worth about $5-$10 dollars. I don't see how this workout yeilds those extreme results I see on Instagram, the workout isn't really for weight loss to me at least! The diet is a diet from another person; people it's the CABBAGE SOUP DIET! Google it! The best part of the DVD were the squats and ab movements and that part was so jumpy I didn't know when to repeat, stop, begin, ANYTHING! But seriously I don't see how these workouts are getting people these miracle results I see on Instagram, makes me question if they're real. The hype surrounding this DVD is crazy and I was hoping it would live up to it. So glad I didn't buy this & just borrowed it from one of my friends cause it's WAY too pricey for the quality and it's just not worth it! I'll stick to 10 min trainer or something :/",1365638400,13,988,4.232804232804233
5549082,5,B00B1DC1CA,"OK! So first off I hardly ever review things on amazon (I know thats bad lol) @nd I waited two freakin weeks two buy it because it was sold out everytime I checked! But I am on day 4 of this DVD. I LUV it. I read some of the reviews before purchasing. There were too many to read through but because of all the buzz about it, I just bought it. SO in my personal opinion I think this DVD works your whole body. I was able to do the full DVD by day 2 and only missed a few lunges and that back breaking Superwoman!! I just do crunches while she is doing the superwoman. My absolute favorite is the cardio boxing (Snatch it back!!) lol OMG I LUV it. Ellen is AMAZING with motivation. As far as the editing, I work through it just fine. I gave the DVD 5 stars based on the cardio boxing and the squats with the video vixen. The DVD is a bit pricey, but I feel its worth it because I have not missed a day yet and it comes with a simple meal plan. Everyone's experience with this DVD will be different. I am 5'5 140lbs and I only want to lose 5 lbs. And get this, I use 10 lb dumbells becuase my local walmart is sold out of every other freakin smaller size! So that makes up for the small extras in the video I miss. I haven't made the soup but I am glad the DVD comes with the extra info. My weight goals are small but I want to stay in shape so I will do this video 3 times a week after I reach my goal! I hope to see more from these ladies in the future.

Side note... The girl all the way to left on the end (Facing the TV) in the group working out with ellen keeps me motivated also! She is a bit healthier than the others but she was more energetic with all the moves the whole time. when I wanted to give up I looked in the back at her!!

The squats were very intense, my quads were burning for a couple of days. The DVD also came with a meal plan, which was kind of confusing to follow.

5549187,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I borrowed this DVD from my sister because there was no way I would be spending $30 for a workout DVD. I seen people talking about it on Instagram so I wanted to give it a shot and my sister told me she bought it. She was very disappointed but she'll be on here to make her own review.

First of all, this DVD is for people who have never worked out before. It's very basic stuff. I see why people are talking about losing a large amount of weight in their first few weeks. Anyone would lose weight if you are just starting to work out. The editing for this video was HORRIBLE. The audio was too loud and you couldn't hear the instruction. Where was the stretching info? What about cooling down? Why must us ""black folk"" always put out bootleg stuff? What happened to quality? And then you want people to spend $30 on it? I love to support good black businesses but I feel like they are taking advantage. All the info they have on that dvd is very basic generic stuff. The meal plan included, which was stolen from the Fat Smash Diet. If you guys are true fitness trainers, couldn't you have created your own meal plans or had a nutritionist create one specifically for your DVD?

The mother seems like she knows what she's doing and is very motivating but the daughter... not so much. I understand why they have the daughter as a part of their fitness brand, because they need someone aesthetically pleasing. She mother may be a little rough looking but she knows her stuff and the daughter is just there to look pretty.

My sister was talking about returning the DVD because of how bad the quality of it was but she won't even bother after seeing the comments on how bad the customer service is. She even asked them about it on Instagram and they deleted her message. Why? People are spending $30 on your DVD. The least you can do is be truthful with them and not delete their questions.

This whole thing is a disappointment. Good thing you didn't market this to white girls too because they don't play when it comes to their fitness and you would have a 1 star overall rating on Amazon. Judging from these comments on here, they are from people who has never worked out before or owned a workout DVD in their life.

I think they are either creating these fake reviews on Amazon or they are getting people from Instagram or twitter to create these 5 star reviews. I want to read real reviews, not fake ones. With all the problems that this DVD has, how are people rating it 5 stars and calling it ""Amazing""?",1365206400,29,2510,4.354700854700854

5549233,3,B00B1DC1CA,The quality of the viedo wasn't professional enough. It was very hard to hear the instructions. Music was too loud. I also with the daughter would have actually done the workout with the rest of the girls. The mother's workouts were more believable because she did everything as instructed.,1364947200,,290,4.938775510204081

I like having shapely curves and do not want to be skinny or thin, and this DVD does a good job of concentrating on slimming down while enhancing/maintaining your curves. However, I feel it could have been done a lot more professionally. The music is terrible and the intro and outro messages are entirely too loud and forced. Titles would have made it easier to navigate as well. It is a good workout, especially with all the squats. I look forward to their next DVD.",1364860800,,521,4.553191489361702
5549247,2,B00B1DC1CA,"I was very excited by the results of users of the DVD posted on Instagram. I got the dvd from a co worker and I was extremely disappointed. This workout is all over the place. There is no real flow. The editing and sound as others have said is horrible. It literally stops in the middle of an exercise and starts over again. Then in the ab portion it just stops all together and goes on to the next segment. There is no stretch or cooldown. I have owned over 25 exercise dvds from Beachbody(Insanity,Turbo Fire,Brazilian Butt Lift) , to Jillian Michaels to the Tone It Up Girls(thats a good one) and I have never done one without a cool down or stretch.  This could cause injury. I also thought from the users on instagram saying they do the workout everyday there would be different workouts on the dvd. Nope... just one workout. So these women are doing the same workout everyday? Thats not healthy for your joints or good for muscle recovery. Your muscles build and repair while resting not while working out. Then add on to that no stretching or cool down- sounds like you are setting yourself up for injury. I asked the creators about this on Instagram and instead of responding my comment was quickly deleted. That seems shady to me. The mom seems like she is in great shape and has knowledge of fitness... the daughter seems like she is just genetically gifted with a nice figure and like another poster said ""wants to be seen"". She wears her long weave down her back and really doesnt break a sweat or look like she is working out hard at all. The meal plan is cabbage soup and no white foods. Very basic. I cant reccomend this dvd ..they need to take all this money they are making and have it re-edited, add a cool down/stretch and add more than one workout so it can be rotated. Instead it looks like they are going on trips to Dubai with all of your money according to pics on their Instagram. If it goes on sale for $10 I would reccomend it to rotate with your other workouts..but for $30 bucks no way!",1364860800,239,2015,4.373333333333333
5549248,3,B00B1DC1CA,"I paid an additional 14 dollars for faster shipping- my DVD arrived maybe 2-3 days after the promised date in an envelope that could be purchased at the local post office. I overlooked those issues just to be glad my product had arrived and I could begin working out and eating healthier. The included ""recipe plan"" is nothing more than a single soup recipe. Again, I let the issue go and popped in my DVD. Ms. Ellen (The Mom) definitely makes this workout worth your money. She's working out with you, keeping you pumped and motivated. Her words keep you pushing even when your muscles make you think you want to quit before really getting started. Lana (The Daughter) seems to have just jumped on board with what mom is doing. She doesn't do much working out on the video. She goes from person to person instructing them on form, reps, etc. but doesn't put much of a personal investment into the workout. She obviously follows a regimen of some sort or may just be blessed with good genes because her body is on point but in front of the camera, it seems she just wanted face time. I would recommend the product just based on its benefits alone but don't buck for any quick shipping and don't expect a meal plan for eating healthy. Its worth your money but you can find the same workouts on YouTube and Google a few clean-eating recipes.",1364774400,17,1339,4.491803278688525

I am absolutely exhausted and sweaty upon completing this DVD.  Last but not least, the meal plan is awesome.  Thanks ladies!  BGWT!!!",1364774400,,307,4.315789473684211
5549250,5,B00B1DC1CA,"Honestly this works and if you follow the meal plan you will see results. I did Insanity and I love that too, but you only see more of a tone to your body and not much weight loss, unlike Black girls work out too with in the first week I lost 7.5 pounds while my body was getting toned as well. I love it and will recommend it to any one that is willing to push them selves. I wish there was a bigger abs section but thats fine and this a WARNING to those who don't like squats through out the whole video you do over 100 squats, but it is worth it and if you push you can do it!! GOOD LUCK TOO EVERYONE WHO IS TRYING TO GET INTO SHAPE  :)",1364774400,3,639,3.7686567164179103

For those who are used to working out, this will definitely give you some variety in workouts. I've done the workout consistently for the past week and every day I noticed I could do a little more than I could the day before. I feel stronger and I can now pretty much do about 80% of the dvd without stopping. I'm also incorporating outdoor jogs to my routine in order to get an additional cardio burn. Overall, I think the dvd is very helpful because you get a little bit of EVERYTHING...if you're looking to lift your buns, get this dvd....looking to tone your arms, get this dvd...looking to tighten your core...GET THIS DVD!",1364774400,3,747,4.5

I toyed with whether or not to get this DVD due to the price but after hearing real life testimonies and people raving on their results I decided to purchase it. While the workout is good and you definitely feel the burn the editing is horrible. The sound is so bad , I had to turn my TV on its maximum volume and I still couldn't hear the instructors very well. The background music is noisy, distracting and drowns out Ellen and Lana's voices. They also could've edited the switch in instructors and exercises better, they re no intervals and you feel mind of rushed and confused .

Maybe there should've been more video and prep tim. Overall I just wished for $30 I would've received a full workout with full ab session (DVD only gives you 3-5 tops)and no cool down. Maybe with the money the ladies made we (GEMS) will receive a well edited version with at least a full body hour workout. Other than that wait until its cheaper($10-15) I didn't use the meal plan. In the end I did tone my butt(thanks to Lana!) and will purchase from BGWT again, in good faith the production staff is on point. The GEMS were GREAT!",1364342400,10,850,4.490322580645161

I've done both and I can get through this entire workout with no problems. For beginners I must say there are not a lot of modified workout for u. Only in one of the segments, I recall. But overall you will sweat & tone.

Pros - You will sweat and tone.

Cons- The quality of the DVD is very poor. If your use to DVD workouts with alot of directions this one lacks it.

No directions on doing the exercises properly.

The music is to loud.

The editing sucks. I was in the middle of doing the abs then it cut to another exercise. I also notice the women were cut out of the shot alot.

Beginners please make sure you remember to breathe throughout because they fail to tell you.

No cool down exercise

Overall the workouts are great but the video could of been produced better. It's shocking actually that they would make the final cut with so many mistakes.  The meal plan gives you no real direction. Basically just known facts.

I would recommend this video for someone who is a beginner. I recommend u follow another meal plan.",1364256000,,1191,4.276785714285714

5549359,5,B00B1DC1CA,"I purchased this DVD directly from their site, before it was on amazon, there were issues with shipping and it took a little longer to get the DVD. This wasn't a killer issue because they promptly responded to this on IG and took care of it right away. I give them a break on the shipping because the DVD just kind of took off after some posted on IG and they are a small business, trying to do it all themselves. I got the DVD with meal plan and cabbage soup recipe. The cabbage soup took some getting use to and I added spices to make it bearable. I will say that they could have given more directions with making it, but again no biggie...plus nothing Google can't solve. The workouts are really good and give you a really good workout! I'm pretty active and thought they wouldn't be intense enough but they are really great! My only issue with the DVD is the editing...it's pretty bad... the music makes it hard to hear the directions(on some DVD players because it works fine on one of my other DVD players). The transitioning is pretty bad as well...they start a move and then restart it, when the first should have been edited out. I gave the DVD a 5 start because it is a pretty good workout and it does what it is suppose to do. This is their first time doing a DVD and hopefully they see the reviews and are taking notes on what went wrong to fix it the next go round. Maybe they will do an advanced DVD and get the editing right...I'd try it. I like them both...you can tell this is something they are pretty passionate about and I support women(especially AA) doing things for our betterment. I would recommend the DVD...I have to several. Again the editing doesn't affect the quality of the workout and you will still know what you're doing so give it a try...you'll be happy with the results...if you follow the workout AND meal plan!

I was disappointed with the editing of the dvd-some of the exercises seem incomplete and you can tell there were a lot of second takes.  The meal plan wasn't worth following because it wasn't detailed at all. I am a little skeptical of the results that people seem to be getting from this DVD, but I can't say yea or nay-every body is different.

I have yet to attempt the workout as I plan to start my journey on 3/25/13. I took time to review the DVD last night and I must say that I'm very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The music is extremely loud and at times I can't hear anything from the trainers. This is very annoying! In addition, I noticed that you have no down/rest time.

5549413,5,B00B1DC1CA,"When I first heard about this DVD I kept seeing it all over Instagram, so I was curious to try it. I was so glad that by the time I purchased it, it was now on Amazon because I just perform ordering through Amazon.com. The workout is great Vitamin Ellen really knows how to work you out. All of the exercises are great. The ab exercise is a killer and so are those squats, but it's all worth it. Lana Ector kind of got on my nerves a little with the long weave and more talking then exercising in the dvd unlike her mom, but I guess that's why she's called the ""Vixen"". Other than that I would recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to lose weight and tone. My sole purpose of purchasing it was to simply tone and it has helped me do that.",1363824000,,737,4.054794520547945

5549437,3,B00B1DC1CA,"If you never worked out using a DVD you may like this. I have tried out a bunch of workout DVDs and thw quality in this one is the lowest. I have tried Zumba, Insanity P90X and a bunch of ""Crunch"" workout DVDs. What I didn't like about this DVD is that it breaks up the workouts instead of a stead flow, the video and sound isn't that great either there is a bit of an echo. What I do like about this is that it does have a lot of squats in the routine and its challenging without feeling impossible. The meal plan isn't even worth it, its not detailed at all! Just get the Fat Smach diet by Dr. Ian, but the soup is actually good, although i didn't follow the given recipe, I YOUTUBED cabbage soup [...] her recipe is better.

Now i followed the duo on social media and was sold by some of the before and after pictures, plus i wanted to support a black owed business, so what i do is switch off between this and my zumba DVD and I run 5k on the weekends so i have a mix of cardio and strenght workouts, because if you try doing only this for 30day you might get bored! how this helps!",1363651200,42,1086,3.981651376146789
5549438,3,B00B1DC1CA,"(And before the same person who's monitoring comments comes on here and tells me to sell it like she's said to everyone else who gave the DVD less than a 4...) My friend got the DVD for us to start. I give it a 3 because this DVD is selling at $30 and the editing is bad. The workout is fine. There's a cooldown point at the 22min mark but does this signal a new workout or what? The transitions are bad. After the first 15 mins of arm workouts, Ellen is still in the middle of the exercise and the screen flips to Lana who goes into 6 mins of a variety of squats. Then it says ""Cool Down starts now."" But it goes into Ellen's version of cardio boxing. Then back to Lana after 10 min. They threw in an ab workout that again is not complete because she's in the middle of the workout when they switch back to Ellen. There is no cool down on this DVD so you must remember to do that part. And stretch.

The average workout DVD is $20 with good edits. For this price, there should have been better sound, editing and transitions.

Not enough to sell the DVD back but enough for me not to tell others to buy it also. We will share this one dvd. The exercises are the truth but the DVD is not. So 3-stars is what it is. Fix those three issues (or lower the price) and 5 -stars it can become. I'm all about support but... we should not adverse to quality and customer service.",1363564800,718,1370,4.051660516605166
5549439,5,B00B1DC1CA,"As someone who rarely workouts, this video is just what the doctor ordered. It is challenging while being totally doable. I've already lost an inch in my waist after a week of doing the video and slowly changing my eating habits. I definitely recommend this video to the ladies that like the ""flat stomach, perky buttocks"" look.",1363392000,11,328,4.771929824561403
5549440,4,B00B1DC1CA,"This is a great DVD!! Love the movement that their starting. I'm going to put my opinion and the only thing I can say is that, they should have a more precise meal plan. It's kind of all over the place not telling me what I need to know precisely.
I looooove @lanaGem routines she really takes her time and gives u the modify versions. Mama vitamin she is too cute!! She is like look if u can't keep up, all well. She doesn't say that but it sure feels like it. Overall I am seeing amazing results! Running down the stairs and my legs aren't jiggling lol.
I'm being realistic and the way some women are losing weight, makes you wonder what addl things are they taking. But hey to each is own and I'm pleased. Can't wait to rock out to the next video. Black girls work out too. ""It's not a look it's my lifestyle.""",1363305600,2,813,4.151898734177215
5549441,4,B00B1DC1CA,"As some other reviews mentioned, this is a great workout for beginners. I'm used to a more intense workout but I do feel the burn! I've been doing this dvd 4-5 times a week, in addition to running 3 times a week, and I am starting to see changes in my body. Below are some pros and cons:

Pros:
Great for beginners
Targets problem areas such as arms, butt, and thighs
Total body workout
Includes meal plan

Cons:
-Those seeking a more intense workout will need to add additional cardio to their routine
-Warm-up not long enough
-No stretching
-Exercise transitions a bit confusing
-Meal plan not detailed enough especially for those just getting started with clean eating

Overall I like this dvd and will continue to use it because I am seeing changes. Hopefully a more advanced workout will be created in the future!",1363219200,21,818,4.627586206896551

5549443,2,B00B1DC1CA,"This DVD is ok but is terrible for the knees according to orthopedic Drs. The meal plan that comes with it is generic. The meal plan comes from the Fat Smash Diet by Dr. Ian Smith. While doing the DVD, it skips and the sound quality is not great. If you get the Fat Smash Diet book, that is the actual 30 day meal plan and add the cabbage soup diet that has also been around for years. Video is otherwise great. Customer service is not great at all and that is the real reason for the low star review.",1363132800,17,501,4.02

This is a very good DVD especially for those that don't normally workout. It's not too hard. The only drawback is that the music is extremely loud. You can't hear what they are saying. You can't even hear how to do the exercises properly which is very frustrating. I sent a message to Ellen on instagram to question if I just had a defective DVD and my comment was quickly deleted. I emailed her and still have not received a response. I also noticed that another 2 other customers posted a comment on instagram about the sound and I added that mine was bad also, and next thing I notice, all 3 comments were deleted. Kind of makes me wonder if that's why there are only good reviews on instagram because all the bad ones are being deleted. I",1362873600,56,877,4.289156626506024

Second issue the background music was so loud couldn't hear any directions given. The next day I sent a email letting them know the issue or better yet to find out if it really was an issue or was all the DVDs that way. Five days later still no response even sent a message on Instagram. Now a week later more annoyed than ever, still no response. DVD will be returned tomorrow and I will not recommend to others.
