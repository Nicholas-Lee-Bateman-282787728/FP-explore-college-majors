4008450,3,B002WYH5UA,Very relaxing but each scene lasts a long time...gets a little boring.  Music is good. Picture quality is not Blu Ray but good.,1395532800,,127,4.521739130434782

4008454,5,B002WYH5UA,"We are using this DVD to set the stage for a series of employee retreats.  The DVD and graphics play as participants enter the program and it helps to put them in a relaxed and comfortable mood.  The photos are wonderful and calming, just as the title suggests.  This is a great tool for both professional and personal use.  We are using three DVD's from this series and have enjoyed them all!",1355875200,,393,4.416666666666667

4008456,5,B002WYH5UA,"This is absolutely the most beautiful DVD of the ocean I have ever
seen. No narration and lovely melodic music in backgroun. The
views are so breathatking I just have to put it on, pause and leave
it there for awhile just to savor the beauty. You will see the
Oregon coast(some of the most beautiful in the world), Big Sur,
Mendocino Coast and Washington Coast. If you are every stressed
out with the everyday world, this will take you to another world
entirely.",1292630400,13,462,4.511904761904762

8383433,5,B002WYH5UA,"This is a gorgeous video series of ocean scenes with variety in waves, sounds, atmospheres, and shorelines. I absolutely love it. The videography is stunning. The scenes slowly pan, as if you were strolling along and soaking it all in. It is a leisurely, relaxing sensation whether on a cloudy day, such as Oregon and Washington's beach weather, or sunny, or sunset skies. The video can be watched with or without the accompanying music. The sound of the waves change from rolling in with a soothing rhythm, to splashing on the rocks, and gentle lapping on the beach. Enough change to keep it interesting, and enough slow panoramic gazing to keep it relaxing. This one is tops!",1426636800,6,677,4.794871794871795
