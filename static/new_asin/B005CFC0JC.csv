4652817,5,B005CFC0JC,"My kids have watched 5 of these movies so far, and enjoyed them all. This is the best value of all of our DVDs.",1346630400,5,111,3.6666666666666665
4652818,2,B005CFC0JC,"While this does have a lot of content for a very cheap price, the content itself is not really worth watching. The only film on here that is worth watching is ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The others, such as Go Hugo Go, are poorly mastered. Go Hugo Go is the worst of the bunch. It is poorly cropped to fit the screen which cuts off a good deal of the edges of the pictures which means you lose words and not just images.

Really, I gave the 2 stars because I did enjoy ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The others are a definite miss.",1335830400,7,514,3.9902912621359223

4652829,2,B005CFC0JC,"I thought these movies would capture the attention of our great granddaughter.  Unfortunately the movies are like the old cartoons and not like the dvd movies she has been used to watching.  We tried three times to see if she would watch any of them, and the outcome was the same.  So will be putting this in the next garage sale.",1364774400,,330,4.377049180327869
4652830,1,B005CFC0JC,If zou look at the the pictures there are all animated movies which is not true. I bought these movies for my 2 girls and didn't expect to have age restrictions of 12 years on them. My younger daughter which is 5 years watched the never ending story and had nightmares about it. Pretty scary for children. A fun kids movie pack should not have violent movies on and age restrictions of 12 years but rather KIDS friendly movies,1362441600,,426,4.405063291139241
