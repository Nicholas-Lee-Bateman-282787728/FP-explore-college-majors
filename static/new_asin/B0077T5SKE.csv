8512170,5,B0077T5SKE,"Kevin Bacon's funny yet brooding portrayal of a down on his luck Radio Jock in the 1960's, named Billy Magic is Academy Award material.  I want an autographed 8x10 of him!  I've been, the kid wanna be and the Boss Jock.  It hits home on many planes and I laughed as the memories of those years came back.  Plus you get another full Movie, that really good too.  I've been trying to get ""Telling Lies"" for the last five years.  It seems the Director had a beef with the many producers and they left it sit on the shelf.  So I was blown away that it was on Blu-Ray and while not a perfect 4K transfer, it was excellent.  I counted only half a dozen pin holes in the print and now, with Blu-Ray, you could actually see the focus puller goof on a couple of hard to do shots.  The music on the soundtrack, alone, is worth the price of admission.

8512171,1,B0077T5SKE,Good movies re-done cheaply in blu-Ray. No subtitles or worthwhile menu. It's really a downer when you pop a flick in the Blu-Ray player and find out that you purchased a dud.,1350864000,4,175,4.5
