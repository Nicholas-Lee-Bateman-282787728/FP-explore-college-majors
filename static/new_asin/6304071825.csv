810940,1,6304071825,"What a shame that white racist media did not allow a true African American to protray the Black Othello.  I am so very thankful that times have changed somewhat.  Laurence Fishburne does a magnificent job and is quite senual in portraying the great protagonist Othello in a moving and convincing manner.  The movie moves one to tears and at last, Shakespeare's intentions for the character of Othello are portrayed on film.

If you really want to see and understand the beauty of Othello, buy the movie starring Laurence Fishburne.

Great job Fishburne.  A white man could never play a  black man--",1134172800,4,598,4.861386138613861
810941,5,6304071825,"I had seen Kozintsev's King Lear years ago and was very impressed but only saw this film recently after ordering the DVD. The DVD transfer is excellent, much better than the King Lear DVD available from the same company.  The film has very high production values and an amazing score by the still controversial Shostokovich. itself is an ear opener.  This interpretation is very much  about Hamlet as an action hero, and Kosintesev conveys the force and limits of Hamlet's agency with amazing economy. Claudius's speech begins the film after shots of the ocean (quoting form Olivier's film of Hamlet) Hamlet racing back for the funeral, and a soldier reads the speech as a proclamation to the crowd outside.  We cut to the court where ambassadors and courtiers are translating it into German and French, and then arrive in the courtroom where Claudius finishes it. We see Hamlet listening at the beginning of this shot, but after Laertes and Claudius speak and Claudius addresses Hamlet, we track back to his chair and see that it is empty.  Ophelia, through the soundtrack music, becomes an increasingly mechanical dancer as she goes mad.  This is very much a political interpretation of the play, with no close ups (like Kurosawa's Throne of Blood)  and it is refreshing to see this perspective on the screen.  Anyone seriously interested in Hamlet and / or in Hamlet on film should see this wonderful film. Note: the DVD comes with various language tracks and subtitles. It's a great edition.",1116979200,17,1495,4.904761904761905
810942,5,6304071825,"This is Olivier's finest performance, although Archie Rice runs it close. Anyone even minimally familiar with Shakespeare criticism knows that, as the play is written, the Moor's tragic flaw is not that he is prone to jealousy, but that he over-dramatizes his self-image. He exaggerates his role in life as a great military commander, with excessive rhetorical relish, and sees himself as a man for whom personal honour and glory are of greater intrinsic importance than anything else, including love, loyalty and forgiveness. This is why and how Iago succeeds in making such a fool of him.

  The role itself is therefore ideally suited to Olivier's over-the-top theatrical style. To complain that this is a filmed stage play is idiotic, since it never pretends to be anything else. That is exactly what it sets out to be: a permanent record on film of a stage production. It is also idiotic to protest that Olivier is a white man playing the part in black make-up: that is how Shakespeare wrote it, 400 years ago, and there is nothing that can now be done to alter it, like it or not.

  Olivier's performance is utterly compelling. Only the semi-literate, or those with the aesthetic sensitivity of a rhinoceros, can fail to be gripped and transfixed by this superb interpretation of one of the most diabolically well-written masterpieces of European theatre. It is interesting to note that such is Shakespeare's genius for stage-craft that even modern ten-year-old American kids (of normal intelligence) can easily follow the development of the drama, in spite of the apparently archaic language.

  Finlay's Iago and Redman's Emilia match Olivier. Maggie Smith's Desdemona is very fine, although I see the role played by someone just a touch more delicate and vulnerable. The stage direction is masterly, and the few simple sets are also excellently conceived. Shakespeare's tragedies are, by their very nature, overpowering works: Olivier understands the timing and significance of every word, and delivers the lines in a manner entirely appropriate to their original creation. I haven't seen all the other Othellos by the many other actors, but can only suspect that their performances, whether by white players or black, must fade and pale by comparison.

  These comments relate to the BHE dvd version, digitally remastered by Warner, which also includes a fragmentary interview with Anthony Hopkins, cast profiles, as well as a brief account of Shakespeare's sources for the play, and its theatrical history.",1091232000,26,2518,5.15970515970516
810943,2,6304071825,"This performance has gathered a great deal of critical praise, but it didn't work for me.  Part of the problem is that it is essentially a taped stage production.  Not that this is always a failing, but in this case it seemed to make Shakespeare's most driven play far too static.  Also, there was too much ""acting"" going on.  Especially from Olivier -- he was so busy trying to be ""black"" with the eye rolling, exaggerated vocalisms and gestures that I couldn't believe a word he said.  His Othello is a caricature.  This production has far fewer cuts than the more recent one with Fishburne, if that is a concern.  What I would like to see would be the taped stage production with Willard White and Ian McKlellan set in the mid-19th century.",1016755200,12,743,4.541353383458647
810944,5,6304071825,"This is the only Shakespearean film I have yet seen in which the acting is truly excellent in every role. I read that it was filmed after a long run as a stage production, which helps to explain the ease with which these actors perform. It is shot with minimal sets and scenery, which makes this film almost like watching the actual stage version.
The text is well preserved, with minimal cuts and/or placing lines out of order (a technique well loved by Welles), and there is no soundtrack, save for music that happens on stage. Again, the acting is first rate in every instance.",1013817600,8,580,4.533333333333333
810945,4,6304071825,"This is a very good interpretation of William Shakespeares play. In fact this version actually has the feel of watching a play. The sets only change once or twice during the entire film. Additionally the camera stays in front of the action which gives the film the appearance of taking place on a stage. And of course there are the performances. All the actors talk and move as if they are on stage. They are quite effective though. This movie was very good.  This should come as no surprise, but Shakespeare does not always translate well to the screen. This film was clever in that it did not try to elaborate too much on the actual material in the written play. This is a good film for Shakespeare fans and people who like the theatre, but people who need constant movement and action should look for a different version.",976665600,5,824,4.530201342281879
810946,2,6304071825,"Since apparently the critics love this film I feel the need to explain that the acting in it is extremely stage-drama oriented, many have said that it was the greatest stage production of Othello ever.  However, it  really does not make it as a movie, the acting is as overblown as I've ever  seen, especially Olivier as Othello.  Sir Lawrence also heavily edits the  text to shape the focus of the play away from the villanious and  entertaining Iago and onto himself, a typical move by the most arrogant  actor of his time.
As a treasured relic from the 1960s this film is  worth watching and owning if your interest lies there, but as a adaption of  Shakespeare's play this film is the worst one that I have ever seen  praised.  The makeup is interesting to say the least but didn't even fool  my professor's 5 year old daughter, who commented ""Isn't that a white  man trying to look black?""

In 50 plus years of teaching Shakespeare I have yet to encounter a presentation of any of the Bard's works has been so powerfully and brilliantly realized.  Olivier's Othello is formidable, yet vulnerable and naive.  Maggie Smith and Frank Finlay as Desdemona and ""Honest"" Iago measure up to Olivier.  It easily merits the highest recommendation.  Buy at least two copies, with additional as a superb gift for anyone loving the work, or even as an introduction to the greatest writer of all time.

811059,3,6304071825,"This film represents the adaptation of a massively influential production at the Old Vic with the National Theatre. Unfortunately it was rather hastily committed to film. The setting is unapolegitcally theatrical, a largely bare stage. The film stock and development are not of the best, leaving us with a stage the color of orange marmalade and Olivier with a shockingly red mouth. Likewise far too little effort was put into adjusting the lighting for film. The result is that the visual aspect of the film is often disappointing.

Olivier's Othello dominates our attention. Many have found this interpretation condescending or, worse, racist. I disagree. Olivier eschews the stiff dignity sometimes brought to the role. Instead this Othello grins, swaggers and generally shows a great deal of bravado. He clearly enjoys the fraternity and masculinity of military life. Yet for Olivier this is not irreconciable with Othello's grand and ultimately tragic dignity and he maintains both aspects brilliantly throughout. Regrettably, never did Oliver become more wrapped up in the physicality of his performance. He gestures high over his head, writhes and falls flat on his face. It's difficult to say how this might have played differently onstage but on on film it seems excessive. As Iago begins to work on Othello, Olivier is already playing with great intensity, giving himself almost nowhere to go. This detracts some of the strongest scenes in the play although much of Olivier's performance is bracingly original and brilliant.

Frank Finlay presents a chillingly cold, intellectual Iago. He does not seethe with hidden rage but presents a detatched, almost disinterested cruelty (motiveless malgnity indeed). Maggie Smith presents a reserved, intellegent and supremely politic Desdemona, worlds away from the girlish interpretations of Imogen Stubbs or Joanna Weinberg. These qualities are well on display as she read ""I do percieve here a divided duty"". Derek Jacobi is surprisingly funny as Michael Cassio and Joyce Redman's Emilia is excused from blame for her involvment in the tragedy in view of her desperate need to regain her husband's affections.

Smith and Finlay, playing with such reserve, create a subdued and chilly background against which Olivier's Othello explodes. There is real affection between Desdemona and Othello but with such quiet, subtle performances the idyll following the marriage is not overwhelming for the audience. We share in little of Othello's great ""content""; the dominant atmosphere is foreboding. The main difficulty is that due to problems of adaptation and problems with Olivier's performance,this film does not always catch fire when it needs to. Much of Othello's descent is off-putting rather than disturbing. What we are left with is much great acting to savor and a number of excellent scenes but, sadly, not a fully realized film of the play.",1372032000,4,2898,5.350877192982456

811066,4,6304071825,"I've been using this film of OTHELLO for about ten years to teach the play. I used to play the video tape, and I remember seeing the movie when it came out in the 60s. I didn't like it much then, but I was much too young.  I remember that I didn't like the big, empty studio spaces up on the movie screen, but they are diminished by the TV screen to a more comfortable size. The main thing in this production, however, is the acting, which is the best overall out of about four major versions (I own them all). Olivier is commanding and very great for at least half the film. The problem is that Olivier is over-acting in the second half of the film, which begins in the play in Act 3, Scene 3, around line 427; however, he recovers balance and is intermittently magnificent till the end, but a' still rages and foams a' th' mouth too much. In fact, in the video OLIVIER, A LIFE, he's critical of his performance himself. However, my students over the past ten years have liked this version best because it contains the clearest, most easily understood acting and speaking that they saw out of several ones I tried in class. Every line is spoken as if this is the way people speak, dispite the four hundred or so years that have passed since this play was written in a language which is the most dynamic and constantly changing of all Western languages. All gestures are pointedly used to underline meaning, and there is a physical energy throughout which is palpable. It's actually more engaging of your attention than most of the other, even newer, versions.

  A friend and colleague of mine said he didn't like Olivier here because his acting reminded him of ""Some guy from Jamaica,"" and some of my students, many of whom are from Jamaica, still laugh at Olivier's rather dark makeup, even though I warn them beforehand that this production is from the 60s and that it used to be common for English actors to play Othello in greasepaint, though some more recent ones have dealt with the ambiguous nature of the Moor's race (the ""black"" he calls himself is, after all, relative) by not making him a black African at all, since a Moor could certainly be from Libya on the ""Barbary Coast"" (as in Desdemona's old servant Barbary). Some of my students also laugh at Olivier's overacting, though I try to explain it away by telling them that he was playing this role on the stage at the same time he made this movie, and that he forgot to tone down his acting when he got in front of the cameras. Recently, however, I had a student who thought that everything Olivier does is logical, based on the text, and, of course, he's right, in a way. In the end,though, most of my students prefer this version for the reasons I've already mentioned, and I agree with them. It may not be perfect, but none of the other versions are either, and Olivier's Othello is still one of the best because he inhabits the role better than anyone else, even Orson Wells in his classic movie based on the play (which has the second best Iago in Micheal MacLaimmoir, and an excellent Desdemona in Suzanne Cloutier).

  Of the other cast members, the best, most memorable (and perhaps the most perfect of the whole cast) is Frank Finlay as Iago, who may be the greatest Iago on film or video. He may even be better than Ian Mckellen in the excellent BBC production directed by Trevor Nunn in 1989. That TV version also has the most intellegent choice for Desdemona in Imogen Stubbs since she really looks the part of the probably young girl who falls in love with and marries the Moor. However, Maggie Smith is passable here as Olivier's Desi, and Derek Jacobi is certainly good in what may be his first film role, as Cassio, while Joyce Redman is outstanding and passionate as Emilia.

  The other versions I like include Orson Wells's 1952 movie version, the 1989 BBC production mentioned above, the 1981 BBC production directed by Colin Lowrey with Anthony Hopkins (some don't like Hopkins's very underplayed performance, the exact antithesis of Olivier's, but it's well-done, I think), and I even sometimes like the 1995 movie with Kenneth Branaugh, although it's perhaps not in the same class as the others.",1321315200,9,4185,4.568
811112,5,6304071825,"Yes, Olivier's performance may be politically incorrect. Rife with stereotypic gestations and histionics, the portrayal was controversal even when it was performed in 1965. Yes, the performance is over-the-top. But once you get past the PC issues I challenge anyone to not be riveted by Olivier's performance. He is simply spell-binding. Once take in your eyes will be glued to the screen and the three hours of this film will have seemed like ten minutes. It is Sir Larry's best screen performance.",1320364800,,499,5.097560975609756
811113,5,6304071825,"This is my single favorite performance by any actor. Despite what your feelings are about the political correctness of blackface, Laurence Olivier delivers a tour-de-force unlike anything I have every seen before. His amazing depth and devotion to the character of Othello is incredible and he is supported by an equally qualified cast. The language is easily understandable because each actor plays the intention of the line and not the words themselves. Any serious actor needs to view this performance again and again to see a master in action.",1312416000,2,547,5.157303370786517
811114,4,6304071825,"As you can see by reading the other reviews here, people either love, like, or loathe Olivier's performance. I'm definitely in the like category. I don't love it but neither do I hate it. I don't have a problem with the black make-up in view of the overtly theatrical nature of the film (Olivier's Arab make-up in KHARTOUM the following year would have been more accurate) and as for his accent, listen to recordings of Paul Robeson's Othello (they exist) and you'll hear a startling similarity. The new widescreen DVD transfer restores some of his body movements which were virtually impossible to see in the old VHS version. What we have is a very theatrical performance of its time captured on film and it needs to be viewed as such. In fact all of the performances are larger than life even Maggie Smith's Desdemona which is stronger than most Desdemonas. It is, however, this very theatricality that gives the film its power. I can clearly understand Shakespeare's text (people not used to it should use the subtitles which are a great help) and the motivations of the characters while Geoffrey Unsworth's photography, when seen in the proper aspect, helps to focus our attention on the play especially when Iago is on screen.

Frank Finlay's Iago is the centerpiece that all the other characters gravitate to. In this version we can not only see his villainy at work but the thought processes behind it. His astonishing performance takes full advantage of Shakespeare's lines. Derek Jacobi's Cassio allows us to see more of the man than I have seen in other film versions (his drunk scene is very revealing) and makes him more of a character than a pawn in Iago's scheme. Finally praise needs to be given to Robert Lang's Roderigo who is not just a two dimensional dupe. Throw in Joyce Redman's Emilia and you have the strongest overall cast that I have ever seen in the too few film versions of this play. In fact they are not only on a par with Olivier but often surpass him. It goes without saying that this movie won't be for all tastes. For those of you looking for a more modern and realistic film of OTHELLO, watch the 1995 Laurence Fishburne version and no version is more cinematic than Orson Welles' 1952 film. However for sheer acting firepower and interpretation of the text, this version can't be topped. Incidentally, standing against a column in the center of Cassio's drunk scene (and in other crowd gatherings) is none other than Michael Gambon.",1276905600,4,2468,4.73953488372093

I was studying Othello for A-level and we were taken to see the film, after which my English teacher rhapsodised about Olivier's performance.

In point of fact, Olivier pulled the rug from under the dramatic climax of the play.

We have been watching Othello going more and more wrongheaded, and the frustration is intense. We want to bang Othello's head against the wall and tell him to stop being an eejit. And right at the end, in storms Emilia and does it for us. The catharsis is quite overwhelming.

Everything in Shakespeare's writing clearly delineates Emilia as the second heroine of this play - feisty, strong, fearless, and with absolutely no time for fools.

The moment where it dawns on her who is responsible for the whole mess: ""My husband!!"" is thrilling.

But oh dear, Laurence, you cast Emilia as a pretty, wimpy, soft little thing, clinging to Othello in distress, when in fact she should have been a Tartress virtually flinging him off the battlements.

After the initial thrill you are so mesmerized by the play that all you see is the characters and the story augmented with Shakespeare's wit.

Othello and Desdemona are the perfect husband and wife.  They love and trust each other implicitly.  It seems that many other people especially men love Desdemona also.  However, his most trusted and ""honest"" friend decides to act on this by treachery and deceit to convince Othello of Desdemona's alleged unfaithfulness.  ""The best laid plans...""

The source being a run of performances in England, each character is literally performing the work with an overview frequently missing in piece-meal performances.  I just want to add, however, that buried in the names of the other actors is one ""Mike Gambon"".  He later went on to play the role of the Vicar in Ghosts for BBC (with Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson and Freddie Jones) and to become the replacement for Richard Harris in the Harry Potter series.  You just never know where famous actors get their start.

When I first saw this movie, it was in an art house movie theater.  Two weeks later, they revived the movie of Hamlet with Olivier.  The best anyone can say of any actor is that Hamlet and Othello were not the same person at all.  The walk, the voice, the movements, the size were all different.  Compare that to his King Lear (much later), and yet another actor emerges.  It made me realize how total the immersion of Olivier into the characters was.

Someone has mentioned that Maggie Smith might not be the vulnerable person they envision.  In earlier times for a white woman to love a black man would have taken considerable chutzpah.  That does not mean vulnerable to me.  I suspect Desdemona was of sterner stuff.

Thanks to this DVD neither I nor my students have to wait nor buy a ticket on a time machine to return to London in 1965.  Incomparable.  Yes, I know Fishbourne did an admirable version.

Olivier plays Othello without any real heart and I didn't care too much about his character. Though this is a complete and about as unabridged film version as you can get, which mimics the appearance of a stage presentation, I didn't even enjoy Iago (my favorite character).  For some reason, they all take a backseat to ""the great"" Olivier.  Seriously, look at the cover.  ""The greatest Othello ever by the Greatest Actor of our time""???  Enough, already!",1211068800,7,782,4.938931297709924
811121,4,6304071825,"I'm essentially of 2 minds about this film. On the one hand, I was consistently impressed by the sheer inventiveness of Olivier's use of the text. The only word which really suffices is ""musical"". He really made the verse come to life, elegantly, even terrifyingly at times. His Othello is larger than life and completely overshadows the others. The scene where he subdues a man (does he strangle him?) with one hand is magnificent.

On the other hand, I am not the least bit bothered by a white man playing the role of a black man in a play like this (surely the first Othello was a white man and the point is that Othello is an outsider, a foreigner, and different; maybe a production should use a white Othello surrounded by black Venetians and Cypriots); it is called ACTING. However, I found Olivier just a little, how shall I say this?, trying too hard to be an Afro-Caribbean. I cannot believe that Othello should sound a little like a Jamaican. I would add that the makeup is stage makeup, so being offended by the large red lips and long lashes is a little silly. It is done that way so that the facial features can be seen from many feet away in the theater. It might have been a good idea to consider toning it down for the film.

If you love Shakespeare, give this a try. Like all masterpieces it lends itself to many, many valid interpretations. This is more than a filmed play, but something less than a movie. Although I would add that with such fine acting (from everyone in the cast), I was not really looking at the sets and costumes. Just as in opera where the music and words are enough to create a mood and drive a plot, the words and their intense and majestic declamation are enough here.",1197590400,7,1711,4.4113924050632916

811153,5,6304071825,"I had the great fortune to see the Olivier ""Othello"" twice at the Old Vic, once seated middle stalls, once seated in first row mezzanine. It was titanic . . . mythic, poetic, incredibly athletic, primal. Every muscle of his legs, arms and chest suggested a huge prowling panther; his feet were the paws of a great clawed cat, an uncaged magnificent wild beast moving over a savannah. There is nothing in Shakespearean stage history to equal the emotional physicality, operatic scope and Olympian power of Olivier's stage performance. I saw it happen not once, but twice: absolutely Himalayan each time, different each time. Nothing but legendary, thrilling Grand Opera performances by the likes of Chaliapin or Olivero match Olivier's display of ""fire from heaven.""

As Ian McKellen does today with his world tour of ""King Lear,"" Olivier alternated ""Othello"" with Chekov ""comedy,"" in his case ""Uncle Vanya"" with Michael Redgrave, Joan Plowright, Max Adrian, etc.

The most important thing to realize about this film, therefore, is that it in no way captures the actual theatrical experience which set the stage aflame in London and St. Petersburg in 1964. The camera is always too close. Always. Olivier in general, and his ""Othello"" in particular, needed to be seen on a stage at a distance of at least 30 feet to get the full scope and power of what he did. This filming is utterly unfair. We need many, many more sustained long shots; we need to see his legs and feet as he prowls, which is half the characterization; we need the resonance of a huge theater to get the operatic oratory Shakespeare composed for Burbage. Othello on stage is not spoken: he is sung. Just study the text. Listen to Verdi's incomparable ""Otello."" There is not one minute in this film that is fair or representative of what Olivier actually achieved theatrically. Yes, many of the gestures, the blocking, the delivery of lines are techniques he employed in his performance. His ""tricks."" But we see them from too close a vantage. They seem overdone, ham, over the top -- precisely because his interpretation and performance are scaled for an arena, not a camera.

I have never understood why he approved the release of this film. Of all classical actors, Olivier knew the necessity to scale back, reinterpret and nuance a close-up filming of his acting. Remember Archie Rice? Why he didn't insist on distance and long shots, given the nature of his interpretation of Othello, is inexplicable. It is the worst disaster in filming a great stage performance that has ever been released. It requires alert and constant memory of his performances to ""know what he was doing"" as I watch the film. I have shared it with students of Shakespeare for years, and none of them sees what I KNOW is or was there. My memory is a far, far more honest representation of Olivier's characterization of Othello than can be seen in this film. I'm embarrassed by it, to the point of listening to the full length recording put out at the time rather than watching this desecration of arguably the most fiery, extraordinary physical stage performance of the 20th Century.

All this said, however, TRY to see through the film to the performances. Piece out his imperfection with your thoughts. Use your imagination. Watch it as if at a distance. Add the torso, legs and especially the feet. Release his arms, gestures and faces from the screen into an arena. To watch this film and even comprehend it, let alone enjoy it, you simply must use your active imagination. If you have not been to great theater and opera all your life, you are going to have a tough time telling what the universal international acclaim is about. The only performance of a Shakespearean tragic hero that is comparable these days is McKellen's world tour of ""King Lear."" But there again, you have to be there in the theater to get it - at $3000 a ticket on the scalper's market. The DVD he will put out will not be the performance he is giving 160 times this year. He will never make the same mistake Olivier did, and try to ""capture"" the scope of his theatricality on film. Unlike Olivier, who was less than ordinarily intelligent, McKellen is a man with a mind who knows we expect Gandalf Redux at the movies. He will reinterpret, scale down, look for an entirely new vocabulary of gestures, looks, and vocal powers that match the medium. We who miss his stage performance miss his Lear - even if we get a truly wonderful DVD with Ian McKellen as Lear when the tour ends. Incidentally, Olivier failed continually in attempts at ""King Lear,"" whom he finally interpreted for DVD (in his dotage and his own words) as ""just an old fart.""

Incidentally and in closing, the VHS and DVD release have been significantly altered by pan-and-scan from the original filming. The original film was shown at the National Theater in London, and though the vantage was far too close, there was indeed more widescreen and distance. I was at least satisfied after seeing the original film on the large screen in a great theater, even with its faults. But what we have in the video and DVD release is unconscionable. See if you don't agree, after watching this ruined treasure, that Frank Finlay's Iago is much more effective and real than Olivier's Othello. Then reflect that on stage together, Finlay was totally eclipsed, to the point where he received uniformly poor reviews for his ""colorless acting."" It's all a question of the medium. Live theater can be filmed perhaps, but never captured - especially as in this case where it films a proud and fearsome panther ranging over hundreds of miles as the actor walks dozens of feet.",1190332800,3,5650,4.767109295199183

I have seen every version of this play that has ever been committed to film, which is no small feat for a woman who adores the Bard as I do.  I am an African American woman and I have heard about the fact that some think that his portrayal of the moor to be stereotypical, well, I don't think so. I think that there is nothing so sweeping as the way that he brings this play to life, Othello is not my favorite Shakespeare play, possibly the third favorite but there is something in the truth of Othello that I think is deeply stirring, it is the truth of self-esteem.  He thinks himself a lowly creature, despite the fact that he is a great general and is acclaimed by many even the trials that he has been through in his life.  Olivier makes you feel that, he wrung tears from me the frist time that I saw him in this performance, like a floodgate, I wanted to hold this wounded man to my heart, he was flawless and seamless, I lost Olivier in this movie, he was purely the character.  I think that if I were trying to get someone to understand the subtle nature of Othello this would be the performance that I would suggest, I am so glad that I saw it one night on cable when I could sleep.  He outshines all others who have attempted this part, ALL OTHERS.  I mean I have seen the Laurence Fishburne portrayal and its good and it has its moments but this one is amazing. I didn't notice his lips being red really, but when you are that dark, the inner part of your lips are redder by contrast.  When I saw it I was floored, his voice,the sheer emotion, glorious.

Olivier is the blackest Othello I've ever seen, the most 'African', in his movements, the wilds of his emotion, the warrior-like curses and threats as he beats his chest and curses his fate. Many thought it was a ham acting, excruciatingly over the top; for me it was a courageous, dangerous performance, walking the line between terror and pity throughout. His voice is astonishing and his delivery unique and musical and frightening and tender. I thought it was his bravest, and greatest, performance.

however, in Othello, olivier ceases to caricature and shamble man in his acting, and acheives probably the greatest shakespearean role we have on film.  i have seen no other performance of ANY shakespearean role, either theatrical or cinematic, that compares with it, unless it be scofield's uniquely powerful and emphatic Lear, or branagh's Henry V, which is wonderfully immediate and uniformly excellent in all its parts.

you may not agree with olivier's interpretation of the moor, which today requires a decisively negro-ish approach to gain critical credence;  but in terms of pure theater, of acting that transcends its vehicle, this is as good as it gets.  absolutely thumbs up.",1179360000,7,1051,5.33939393939394

It's troubling that so many people have made it fashionable to target the play in recent times because of it's alleged racism - centered around the fact that the central role has historically been taken by Caucasians until recently. Even the blackface makeup work has come under fire as some sort of mocking routine - how pray tell is one to play a Moor with a pale skin one wonders?

Nothing better exemplifies the utter stupidity of some of the commentary than those penned by 'the poetess' on this listing. Only an African-American like Fishburn can possibly understand how to play the role of a 'fellow African' she boldly states. Presumably this also means that an African-American couldn't possibly deal with the complexities and subtleties of taking on a white dramatic role because we too are somehow 'different' and beyond the ken of other races? Of course, the fact that the role of Othello was imaginatively written centuries ago by a white dramatist with next to no personal experience of Moorish or African culture is a moot point in her assertion that the role can only be successfully interpreted by an African-American.

7865115,5,6304071825,"""Othello"" is a play that makes many people uneasy. Perhaps it's because of race: it seems incredible that an Englishman writing in 1604 would portray a marriage between a black man and a white woman (keep in mind ""mixed marriages"" were still illegal in most states until 1967). Debate has long raged over whether Shakespeare imagined Othello as a North African Berber or Arab or as a black African. It's difficult to say: as late as the eighteenth century the terms ""Moor"" and ""Negro"" were used interchangeably, and no sharp distinction was made between Muslims from the Mahgreb and inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa. It's possible that Shakespeare, given his often shaky knowledge of geography, didn't know the difference, or, if he did, didn't care. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Othello was portrayed by white actors in blackface; the nineteenth century saw a preference for a light-brown skinned Arab (a notable exception was Ira Aldridge, the first African-American to play the part). If the idea of a white actor in blackface now seems horribly racist, keep in mind this was 1965, the year of ""Bloody Selma"" and the Voting Rights Act. If anything Great Britain was even less advanced in race relations than the U.S. (minstrel shows were still considered legitimate entertainment!) Perhaps Olivier was the only white actor with the genius to pull it off. To his credit he puts Othello's blackness front and center, offering no apologies. Of course his accent is totally contrived. Still, he gives a powerful, passionate performance, though not without its eccentricities (especially the unmotivated humming and chuckling); he is riveting in the final acts. This movie gives us a chance not only to witness Olivier at the top of his game but a young Maggie Smith as Desdemona and Frank Finlay (Iago) and Derek Jacobi (Cassio) at the beginning of their remarkable careers. All are excellent. Smith's Desdemona is eloquent and moving, while Finley's bold, masculine Iago dominates much of the action. Olivier, Smith, Finlay, and Joyce Redmond (Emilia) all received well-deserved Oscar nominations. Only the shrill Sheila Reid as Bianca is less than satisfactory. Stuart Burge does a brilliant job of transferring John Dexter's stage production to film, with fine camera work from Geoffrey Unsworth (""2001: A Space Odyssey""). Jocelyn Herbert's designs are true to the period and have an abstract quality, a welcome change from the overstuffed fussiness of many British productions.

7865116,4,6304071825,"Othello (VHS, 1996)  reviewed Aug 22, 2006

This production, originally for the stage, but then filmed, was a major effort for Olivier who had played Iago in the past, but now sought to ""forget"" that role and become the Moor. The result was an Oscar nomination for Olivier ,for his Desdemona, Maggie Smith, and for Fred Finlay who played Iago. Also among the actors is John Gielgud, playing Cassio.

My wife objected to the fact that Olivier played the role in black face. While this might remind some of the cheap racist laughter of some of the minstrel shows, I did not see anything disrespectful in the least. Olivier's Moor has great dignity, bearing, and certainly enjoys respect in the highest quarters of Venice, at least until his undoing. Desdemona, too, is played with great dignity and strength befitting the role. Iago, by contrast is played effectively as one constantly looking to one side or another, looking for opportunity. This fits well with the character's improvisatory aspects (reminding one of Richard the Third in this respect).

The play is painful. It is painful to see the undoing of a good man, and a promising marriage. Olivier emphasizes the torture Othello feels in each dialogue with Iago. It causes him to deteriorate from the objective, dignified general into a ranting, screaming savage. This is painful in the extreme. Some may feel that it is over done, and this is why I rate it a 4 out of 5 (good) rather than excellent. Such a method obviously is better suited to the theater where the larger than life acting is required to reach us in the back row. But in the more intimate medium of film/video, it is a shade too much. The more recent film with Lawrence Fishburn as Othello and Kenneth Branagh as Iago is played more subtly, more sensuously, with a better feel for film. It is less painful in that Fishburn's Othello is more down to earth and does not fall as far. The personal loss is foremost in Fishburn's performance, the moral deterioration is foremost in Olivier's. The tragedy threatens us less in the more modern version.

I am also a graduate of Boston University's Theatre Program.  I was very much looking forward to this production as the first movie version of this play.  Before this there was only the acclaimed version of Paul Robeson's performance on the New York stage.  However, I was aghast when I first saw Olivier on the screen...to say his make-up was more like that of a minstrel show would not be off base.  In fact, his whole performance was so close to being a farce about ""those savage African chieftains."" that if I had been a black person, I would have wanted to vomit.  His interpretation of Othello was so off the mark that at times his dialogue did not even fit the scene...at one point he is talking with a council of visitors who had just arrived on his island where he has been appointed governor and the scene is about his greeting them and welcoming them.  He is literally frothing at the mouth as he answers them in what is supposed to be a scene about his courtesy and civility.  I re-read that section when I returned home and it clearly was not designed to show him as a madman.  I can only say I came away feeling that Olivier had clearly decided to plain this role as a way of defining Othello the way he the actor felt about Black people in general...perhaps he had read the account of Shaka Zulu who defeated an entire British regiment in a battle that went down in history.  Of course, Britain had egg all over its face...and apparently Olivier was doing his best to get back at that African nation.  At any rate, his portrayal was an insult to all Africans and Black people across the globe, and for the critics to give him kudos for that performance is to show how tone deaf they are to such hypocrisy.",1518480000,,1854,4.329479768786127

March Boy nominations: Leading Actor-Laurence Olivier and Leading Actor-Frank Finlay.

I am taking the time to write this review because last year I did a survey of the Academy Awards in 1965 and was curious about this film but put off by the wildly divergent reviews on the critic page of the Internet Movie Database and the Unofficial Academy Discussion Board--Stuart Burge doesn't do enough with the production to translate the play from stage to screen, Laurence Olivier's black-face method is too racist/politically incorrect, his speech patterns are too forced and 'put on,' his mannerisms are too hammy, self-conscious, awkward, etc.)

However, I read Shakespeare's play for the first time last month and was so thrilled by it that in the end I decided to bite the bullet.

All I can say is WOW! WHAT A REVELATION!!! Olivier IS Othello! He makes the drama real and compelling! All the character's volcanic rage, hatred and paranoia are there, but there are also very subtle shades peppered throughout to portray his gentler sides--such as when he explains to the court, his elopement with Desdemona was consensual on her part and when he greets her after his victory over the Turkish pirates.
He is especially great in the climatic scene with Desdemona where he almost causes Justice to break her sword. Even though, we as the audience know, Desdemona is innocent and Iago is playing Othello for a fool, you still understand why he carries out the punishment in spite of his conflicting feelings, because Olivier really pulls you into the characters moral dilemma. You can tell he doesnt want to kill her for her supposed infidelity but deep down he knows justice belongs to ALL men or it belongs to none. In other words, if you let your family members or friends off the hook simply because of your ties to them, its NOT justice. There MUST be an atonement.

Yes, the boot polish effect is cheesy but if you concentrate on Oliviers performance, it quickly wears off because you can tell he wanted to play this role with every fiber of his being and pulled through with his masterful understanding of Shakespeare to create a thoroughly credible performance.

Frank Finlay masks Iagos villany under an intricate facade of gallantry and courtly mores. He seems so kind and understanding to Othello, Cassio and Desdemona that for a moment you're tempted to think Does he really mean it or is this just part of his plan? Does he feel a tinge of remorse for the roller coaster hes setting in motion? My favorite scene is where he unleashes Othellos wrath. When Othello makes his Arise, black vengeance! speech, Iago himself looks scared. His face says Uh-oh, maybe I went too far. Maybe I better put a cork on the volcano! He tries to persuade Othello to spare Desdemona and punish Cassio alone but there is no stopping the roller coaster now, and then his old hatred and jealousy comes back and you realize, hes not sorry enough.

When I read the play, I had a problem with the way Shakespeare wrote Iago because he seemed like a motiveless villain. I couldn't buy the idea of a man causing trouble just for the thrill of it. There HAD to be a deeper reason for Iagos desire to sabotage Othello and Finlay creates a very believable one.

Iago is jealous of Othello because he seems to have a perfect marriage while his own is dead. But instead of taking steps to improve his relationship with his wife Emilia (he pushes her away when she tries to cut up with him about the handkerchief) he wants to drag Othello down with him. Watch how he frowns when Othello greets Desdemona after his battle with the pirates. He is so dead inside, he has to make everything else dead around him. I had no sympathy for him, of course, since he was the villain of the play, but I still understood why he was the way he was, thanks to Finlays masterful characterization.

Stuart Burges direction is often criticized as being too stilted and stagey but frankly it works perfectly well for Othello, because the story takes place indoors most of the time. His approach is strictly no-nonsense. No fancy camera angles. No dramatic music. No ostentatious costumes and sets to distract the viewer. Just a group of Shakespearean professionals doing their thing.

While Olivier's performance is and always will be iconic and masterful, in today's age we can no longer overlook the fact that he is in blackface.  This film is a time capsule, and should be regarded as such; rather than esteemed as the definitive Othello performance.  As an educator, it is important to make the distinction.  The film can be a powerful way to approach the subject of race in the classroom when accompanied by current (and historical) performances by African American actors of the same role, and can give way to other meaningful conversations that include contemporary professional theatre issues that also pertain to race (color-blind casting, ""problem plays"", and so on).  In my opinion as an educator, history is only valuable if we can use it to explore, understand, and better the world we live in today; a world that is viewing and interpreting race more closely than ever before.
