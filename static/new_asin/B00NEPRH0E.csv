There is a full moon over a graveyard. Two men approach the TALBOT mausoleum and break in. They find the casket of Lawrence Talbot and search for a gold ring. Things go awry! Next a constable finds an injured man in the street. Taken to a hospital he quickly revives. But a full moon brings out a new side to his character, and the result is an anti-social act. Would psychoanalysis cure him? Can medical science prevent recurring bad times? The doctor consults a thick book and finds a definition that covers his delusion. The police Inspector and the doctor visit the mausoleum and find the empty casket. How can that be?

Lawrence Talbot escapes from the hospital, and find the old gypsy woman who can help him. They travel to a rural village to find Dr. Frankenstein, only to learn he has died! The villagers hated him and his monster. Another full moon transforms Talbot into a werewolf. Soon a dead girl is found, and the villagers form a well-armed posse to hunt the wolf at night. Talbot flees, and falls into an icy chamber. The next morning he finds a body encased in ice. Frankensteins Monster has survived! Alive, he leads Talbot to Dr. Frankensteins secret store of documents, but do not find what is sought. Talbot gets to meet the daughter Baroness Frankenstein by posing as a buyer for the lands and ruined castle, a unique location. But she has no records, she says.

Outside the peasants of Vasaria are celebrating the Festival of New Wine. [Did they know the secret of drinking red wine to counteract fats?] Life is short and death is long, so drink up. The more oppressed a people, the wilder their celebrations. Doctor Mannering find Talbot and wants to bring him back to England to cure him. The happy festival is disturbed by the appearance of the Monster in the town square, like a stock market crash bringing an end to exuberant times. The people gather together and resolve to put an end to the Monster and its terrorism. The Baroness and Doctor Mannering go to the castle to search for Frankensteins diary and the Secret of Life and Death. Doctor Mannering decides to repair the machines in order to put an end to the Monster that periodically creates havoc among the people. His intentions are good.

But Mannering is seduced by dreams of power, and decides to increase the power of the Monster! The Baroness intervenes and pulls a switch, causing the machinery to fail. But the Monster breaks loose and attacks Mannering and the Baroness. The wolfman breaks loose to attack the Monster, letting the Doctor and the Baroness escape. One of the peasants blows up the dam and the flood flushes away the castle, the wolfman, and the Monster. Is this the end? The moral to this fable is to beware of creating a powerful monster that will escape from control and oppress the people. [This story in this film is not as good as some others in this series.]",1413936000,,2951,4.636711281070745
