1219484,1,B00000IBQH,"I thought 'N Sync was actually going to be in the video. But it was BB editor and people talking about them. I wasted my money and I don't reccomend buying the video unless absolutely obsessed like me. And also,  they pronounced Lance's last name wrong. Stay 'N Sync!",920764800,,267,4.448979591836735
1219627,1,B00000IBQH,"I BOUGHT THIS TAPE, EXPECTING IT TO BE AS GOOD AS THE *N THE MIX TAPE (WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT). AS I WATCHED IT.... I JUST KEPT WAITING FOR @ LEAST A REAL LIVE TAPING OF THEM TO SHOW. I WAS WATCHING ONLY BECAUSE  I WAS CONTINUOSLY WAITING AND HOPING FOR SOMETHING TO SHOW UP THAT WAS  DECENT, SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RETURN IT. HOWEVER, IT ONLY HAD SOME LADY  ASKING THE DUMBEST QUESTIONS TO 5 YEAR-OLD KIDS WHO PROBABLY ONLY HAD  *//\\//SYNC'S CD. AND THE CLOSEST I GOT TO SEEING *//\\//SYNC, WAS A  PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND. SO, I AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED IT. MY  RECOMENDATION WOULD BE TO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME BY BUYING IT.",954460800,17,637,4.3559322033898304
1219628,1,B00000IBQH,This video is all fans and no *Nsync!  You can see and get all the information this video has from a magazine.  Pass this one by.,950313600,20,129,3.923076923076923
1219629,1,B00000IBQH,my friend got it and i almost fell asleep. it just shows fans ( at least they think their are fans) repeating the same thing. it doesn't so but 2 pics of *NSYNC. so take my advise and get N' The Mix.,949622400,11,199,3.761904761904762
1219630,1,B00000IBQH,"I was very disappointed with this video.  I was hoping to actually see 'N Sync.  Instead, this woman walked around asking incredibly repetitive questions to the same people.  My only advice is to never buy unauthorized  videos.  This one was horrible.",945820800,7,251,5.024390243902439
1219631,1,B00000IBQH,this video was terrible! i bought it thinking nsync would be it ---but they werent...at all...DONT WASTE YOUR CASH ON IT....buy official things only!,939427200,,149,5.25
1219632,1,B00000IBQH,"I bought this video thinking I was gonna see nsync, and what do I get------>a stupid woman talking to a bunch of girls about nsync. You don't even get to see them. What a bunch of chedder pure chedder!",935625600,,201,4.17948717948718
1219673,1,B00000IBQH,I have seen this video..thank goodness it was my friends and not mine.  It was really bad!!!  Don't buy it!  I love *N Sync so much and I can't believe someone would put out that video and say it is for everyone *N Sync  fan...oh my..that is soo wrong..go buy *N the Mix or save your money! Stay  *N Sync!!,932515200,,306,4.033333333333333
1219728,1,B00000IBQH,"A didn't buy this video afriend did and I'm glad that I'm not like her.  She buys anything with their faces on it.  That is sad, but she doesn't know any better.  Now the unauthorized BSB video was actually worth it.  At  least you can see when they were first starting out.  This video is a total  heaping pile of S---!!!!!!!!!",930096000,,328,4.278688524590164
1219831,1,B00000IBQH,There is a dumb girl who walks around and talks to annoying ditzy girls.  They son't even talk to the guys.  All they do is show pictures of them.  The girl doesn't even pronounce their names right.  It doesn't even deserve  one star.  So PLEASE take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO.,924566400,,287,4.222222222222222
1219832,1,B00000IBQH,I have to say that I bought this video because it was about *N SYNC and I collect everything with their name on it.  But it is very poor quality.  The camera bounces around the whole time and most of it is filmed at an  angle.  All this video is is the fans talking about why they liek *N SYNC  what they like about them who their fav is why and what not.  If you are  not a hard core fan I suggest not buying this video because it is very very  boring.  But if you are a hard core fan buy it and just don't watch it.,923702400,,517,3.712962962962963
1219833,1,B00000IBQH,"This *NSYNC video is really bad, it doesn't show any of the guys and its SOOOOOO boring its a waste of money. NEVER Get it i'm serious!! by the was JUSTIN IS SO HOTT I LOVE HIM SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH I HAVE 146 PICTURES OF HIM  ON MY WALL AND COUNTING SIGN UP TO MY NL!!",923529600,,265,3.8181818181818183

7909757,1,B00000IBQH,Good thing that this was not much to buy.  I am  disappointed in it. And the information about lance birthday is wrong he was born on May 4th  1979 not may 7th.,1483660800,,160,3.9375
7909758,1,B00000IBQH,The artists mention were nowhere to be found.  The documentary was just a bunch of tweens raving about what the like about Nsync.,1216944000,,129,4.608695652173913
7909759,1,B00000IBQH,"If you want *NSYNC buy their official titles:

There's some nice candid footage, as well, while on tour. Hear what they have to say, unlike this unofficial mess, ""NSYNC NEVER ENOUGH.""

It's hard to come off disappointed,embarking on this nonstop adventure!""*NSYNC NEVER ENOUGH"", could NEVER COMPARE!
One quickie shot of the band, without sound, at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade isn't notable to their hugest of fans!

It has a lot of silly craziness, with each member. See their hygienics, as they travel throughout Europe, promoting their first album.",1212278400,,1509,7.579545454545454
7909760,1,B00000IBQH,"This is the dumist video ever. They play the same thing over and over. They don't know nothing about them, they forget to mention that Joey is also in the group. It doesn't even have interviews with the guys. Please don't waste your money on this [production].",1018396800,5,260,4.553191489361702
7909761,1,B00000IBQH,If you are an nsync fan's fan or think you might be in in go ahead and buy this video by all means... because you won't see Nsync in it trust me...,1003708800,,147,3.625
7909762,1,B00000IBQH,"This thing falsely baits the Nsync fan into thinking that this video is of Nsync, when in reality, it should be called ""look at all the little children going to the nsync concert!"" It has NO footage of the guys at all, and it's just some stupid lady walking around asking people what they're favorite nsync song is. And since it was before no strings attatched came out, you get to sit there and watch all these kids saying, ""God must have spent a little more time on you"" over and over again. They even use the same kids more than once, I think. Oh, least I forget the other complete morons in the video like some unknown disk jockey and some women who works for one of those teen mags. The only thing that caught my attention was the fact that this tape was apparently made here in Torrance, CA. Where I just happen to live. WHOOPIEEEEEEEE. I feel sorry for all of us out there that actually fell for this. The best pictures on the entire video are the ones on the cover, seriously!!! Don't buy this trash.",980985600,9,1008,4.310526315789474

7909764,1,B00000IBQH,"This is terrible! They even forgot Joey...what's up with that??? No wonder it's not official--it's not *NSYNC! Even if you're the biggest *NSYNC fan, don't waste your money on this! :(",971913600,14,184,4.967741935483871
7909765,1,B00000IBQH,"I bought this video a while back.  I hate it, it sits on my shelf collecting dust because there is no need to ever watch it a second time.  There is not any part of the real group except pics fands are holdin.  Instead of buying this video buy their CD again and support them.",956102400,,276,3.981818181818182
