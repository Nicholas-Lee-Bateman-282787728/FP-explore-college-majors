4988777,5,B006H3KR3E,Excellent blend of horror with nazi reputation for seeking the occult.  Does mention cthulhu deities  in passing but i wouldn't consider it a C-  movie.,1337385600,5,152,5.0
4988778,4,B006H3KR3E,"Based upon reading another review, I ordered this movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect and overall, it is one of those great Friday night, stay at home eating popcorn, scary movies.  I won't summarize the movie - that's been done.  But I can say the movie would be OK for kids to watch, so long as you know they might have a nightmare over it.  But, that's half the fun of watching scary movies.  There is blood and guts all over the place - which looks very realistic.  Enjoy!",1331251200,4,477,4.2444444444444445
4988779,3,B006H3KR3E,"Set on June 5, 1944--the day before D-Day---this film gives us two British soldiers who stumble upon a stone encampment bereft with weird goings-on.  They find themselves facing a Nazi soldier harboring a deep secret---a demon summoned to foil the impending invasion.
THE DEVIL's ROCK evolves into a three-character drama that seems more like a stage play.  There's plenty of gore but the movie moves very slowly and demands a lot of patience.  Craig Hall and Matthew Sunderland are effective in their roles, but the New Zealand accents are often hard to understand.  The demon's make-up looks like something a contestant on SyFy's FACE-OFF might conjure up, albeit it's not too bad.
While the premise is substantiated by Hitler's fascination with the occult, having only one demon to stop the invasion seems ludicrous.
In summary, THE DEVIL's ROCK is an okay rental but wouldn't merit repeat viewings.",1329696000,2,902,5.115646258503402

4988822,1,B006H3KR3E,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a fan of bad horror movies, psychological thrillers, and basically... any movie that's got some sort of philosophy to contemplate or intriguing writing to develop any sense of suspense

This movie has absolutely none of that.

It's a rather tired, generic ""feature length"" film, the majority of which is filled with shallow expository writing and exhausted tropes.

The premise *sounds* interesting: Commandos in World War 2 attacking a Nazi bunker and encountering an unknown supernatural presence. You'd imagine that that alone would set it up to be a ""well""-written B-movie to put it up there with the likes of Dead Snow or Demons at the Door. You'd be wrong. Any sense of urgency or action dies down within the first 20 minutes, and all that we're left with is a cast of characters that we know little about and care even less for.

Perhaps the only potentially redeeming factor is in the set and costume design. The creators opted to forego corny CGI effects for the most part, relying instead on traditional props and make-up work. It actually doesn't look half bad, but unfortunately and ultimately it felt like a wasted contribution to a film that is completely devoid of a meaningful plot, characters, or dialogue. The acting was fairly decent (though I wasn't convinced by the German actor that much...), but all the acting in the world can do nothing for a story without content.",1521849600,3,1432,4.83265306122449

The level of tension in the opening scene is much higher because unlike mainstream movies, you know anybody can die at any time in horrible ways.  The contrast between sickening gore and temptation via the villain was effective in a way that you won't find on the big screen.  I'm not into gory horror movies but because the whole production was done so well I have to say was decent overall.",1520294400,,539,4.36

I've never heard of it till tonight, but the acting was first class as was the cinematography. I could see this on stage with the small cast it required. The dialog was well done and fitted both the main and secondary antagonist given who they were. The plot twisting was timely and believable given the circumstances and chain of events. In a general sense it reminded me of a 1978 novel by Graham Masterton called, 'The Devils of D-Day', which is a good little fast read horror story if you like the film.",1520121600,,619,4.636363636363637

After hitting the beach of a small island off the coast of France, the two advance to a concrete fortress. All goes according to plan, until screams are heard. Convinced that a woman is being tortured inside, Hall enters the installation, w/ Tane soon following. Once inside, the mystery begins. We slowly learn that these soldiers have far more to fear than Nazis! Something has happened in this place. Something catastrophic and unimaginable, leaving nothing but mutilated corpses in its wake. Their mission completed, the horror begins. Death and darkness ensue, as the true evil is revealed! The rest is a race to stop it, before it breaks free of its bonds, and continues its slaughter. Though much of the carnage has happened before this story begins, it's visceral representation certainly gets the point across!

PLOT SPOILER: The demon for Trekkies: Nancy Crater. The rest of you won't get that spoiler without a search. I venture to guess, most of you already know reading through reviews. The production combines that episode with Norse Mythology and the first Indian Jones feature. The acting and story were fine. The film never had more than three characters on the screen at one time and could be done as a play as the action takes place in 2 rooms plus hallways. The creature effects were decent and won a local NZ film award in 2012. The blood squirt scene could have been better. A lot of dialogue as compared to action. 3 1/2 stars

Plus, there aren't nearly enough movies out there that mention, or even focus for that matter, on the very real missions that the Nazi's funded trying to find magical/occult/supernatural weapons to use against the Allies.

I think some big budget movies pale in comparison to the Devil's Rock.  The movie had a good and eerie feel to it from the beginning to include the sound.  Got me in the mood for a good horror flick.  Good casting was the next thing I noticed that the director got right!  Craig Hall fit perfectly as the military leader. He was the right age and had the right physique. His acting was good I have to say that the goatee is his calling card.  Gina Varela's beauty stood out.  Those beautiful facial features...ie. her cheek bones, make her stand out from other actresses.  Her acting was as close to perfect considering her experience at the time so if she continues to hone those acting skills then she'll definitely have even more promise. I think she would make an excellent Wonder Woman.  And lastly the director, Paul Campion, who had much to do with how this movie came out did an awesome job NOT making this movie look corny.  For the vast majority of movie lovers, the director is the unsung hero.  I think he is why all the actors did such a fine job.

4988962,4,B006H3KR3E,"Devil's Rock is a refreshing entry into the low budget horror genre. Movies in this genre are usually brutally acted gorefests with stolen plots done poorly. Devil's Rock has a fantastic story and considering the director tells us he took out a mortgage on his house to make it I commend the effort he did with few funds. Most horror fans will be familiar with the demons encountered on a semiweekly basis in the series Supernatural. Devil's Rock blows away these depictions. The demon here develops a distinct personality and is jarringly frightening without being an exorcist clone. Since Devil's Rock is a low budget movie you don't have much of a cast so you have to accept that the British are going to send two commandos to blow up a Nazi gun point. While the movie could have used some extra soldiers to fill out the commando squad at the heart of the movie is a tense series of dialogs and plotting between three characters and Devil's Rock does that extremely well.

Devil's Rock manages to be foreboding in its sets using only 3 main stages from what I can tell. In the featurettes section you get a good idea of how matte paintings can cheaply give atmosphere (and how much fake blood costs!). Speaking of extras the dvd is loaded with them including an insightful director's commentary. A real hidden gem, Devil's Rock won't disappoint,",1388966400,7,1348,4.687763713080169

4988964,4,B006H3KR3E,"The Devil's Rock (Paul Campion, 2011)

2011, it turns out, was a surprisingly strong year for under-the-radar horror movies. I don't think any of them surprised me more than The Devil's Rock, a period piece that takes place just before D-Day off the coast of Normandy. That sort of thing just begs ""abuse the hell out of me"", but Campion (Night of the Hell Hamsters, a hilarious short you can dig up on Youtube), adapting his own story, resists the temptation by having all of the action take place in an island bunker, turning this into an interesting variation on the talk-piece. That just happens to contain the devil.

Plot: D-Day is in motion. Two commandos, Ben Grogan (The World's Fastest Indian's Craig Hall) and Joe Tane (The Two Towers' Karlos Drinkwater), are sent to take out a German gun emplacement on an island off the coast of Normandy. When they get there, however, they discover that someone--or something--has done their work for them, leaving only a handful of survivors, most of those dying. The only person who seems to have gotten away relatively unscathed is Klaus Meyer (Out of the Blue's Matthew Sunderland), a Colonel in charge of a secret Nazi project--making a pact with the underworld to ensure German victory in World War II. He seems to have done a better job than anyone expected him to, but he's managed to trap the demon in the summoning circle. The problem is, the demon is very good at manipulating humans--and Ben Grogan really, really misses his wife, Helena (Samoan Wedding's Gina Varela)...

This is a movie that's all about atmosphere--a small number of characters, a small number of sets, and a strong reliance on script and acting to pull it all off. It's not at all your typical horror movie, which may explain its surprisingly low ratings on IMDB (5.5) and Rotten Tomatoes (36% public, 56% critics, and that rather wide divide between public and critical reaction at RT is usually telling). As long as you go into it understanding that, I think you will have a very good time with this movie; it does a very good job with all the necessary pieces and cuts extraneous nonsense to the bone, at least after the first few sequences. Definitely worth checking out. *** ",1370822400,3,2210,4.747395833333333

Of course, I'm pleased that Director ""Paul Campion"" has foresight, and insight to accompany his artful cinema-graphic storytelling.

Without giving away a single thing, ""THE DEVIL'S ROCK"", though not exclusive in eeriness, drama, suspense, and cunning, it satisfies in a manner that leaves one wanting more by its end.

Two commandos land on a German occupied island in the English Channel, on the eve before D-Day, to knock out a gun fortress as a diversion to the main invasion of Normandy. At first they are puzzled that no one seems to inhabit the island, even thinking they landed on the wrong island, though the huge concrete gun fortress is there looming ominously over the English Channel. Little do they realize that their not alone, & that more than just humans occupy the fortress.

""The Devils Rock"" is a rewarding little watch for those who stick with it. It is an intimate film, only having four characters to it's story, but that is all it needs. The small cast is well acted & directed. They enhance the already eerily foreboding atmosphere of the gun fortress, with it's long cold half lit cement hallways. One's imagination could run wild here. An occasional cry is heard from inside, only to reinforce the isolation & the fear it brings.

The Germans were/are here, but it's not guns & defensive positioning that this gun fortress on an island is about. It's isolation is being used for the occult, & their black magic has summoned up a she Demon from hell. Aptly portrayed by Gina Varela, both in human & demonic form, she is the central figure that makes this film work. Her make up is just right, not overdone or underdone, she really does look like she's sat on Lucifer's knee! But, unfortunately, she does not appear until the last third of the film.

Yes, all the cast does a great job, but the rock blocking the road here is that two thirds of the film crawls to building up the last third. Not that it's not well scripted, & also has it's dreadful charm, but there is not a lot happening, as the characters are piecing together what has happened & meet up with the only German still alive, an SS Colonel who has some surprises in store. A person could go either way with this build up, you can either love the tension it builds or fall asleep. I lean a tad towards the former, but this film would easily rate higher for me if there was just a little more happening to shake things up. As it is, it's still a very good piece of work from what is probably a direct to DVD affair. Quite superior given all the garbage that resides in the horror section of the low budgeted. So if you've the time & the patience, ""The Devils Rock"" is a good place to visit on a dark night.

One quick note, this film reminds me somewhat of another Nazi war time horror film, 1983's ""The Keep.""",1353715200,2,2504,4.376344086021505
4988971,5,B006H3KR3E,"The Second World War. Widely considered to be perhaps the one and only true war where the forces of good battled evil. From World War II comes cinemas go-to villains: the Nazis. Indiana Jones hated them, Laurence Olivier's fugitive Nazi tortue methods left audiences squirming in The Marathon Man; and they proved to be a supernatural force to be reckoned with in Outpost. So, taking this villainous cinematic staple as its core, The Devil's Rock is a 2011 horror film from New Zealand but set in the German-occupied Channel Islands of World War II.

The Devil's Rock comes to audiences from the mind of British writer, Paul Finch. The backstory is well-researched and this is further fleshed out (for those interested) on the film's website.
Naturally, New Zealand acts as a substitute for the Channel Islands and the fantastically well-preserved Wrights Hill Fortress stands in for a German fortification. Its tunnels and hallways provided a suitably convincing, eerie and claustrophobic setting for this particular story to be told in.

The Devil's Rock plays out with only a handful of characters and once you've read the synopsis, there is little in the way of surprise when the true nature of the ""beautiful but Devilish captive"" is revealed. However, this does not spoil the film in any way since the focus of the film is more on the inner turmoil suffered by Grogan and questions arising as to where his own and the Nazi officer's loyalties truly lie...

I initially had gripes with the antipodean accents evident in the movie but these are ably explained away in the case of the commando team and the film's website paints a background of having spent time in education in England for the Nazi officer's intonation.

The special effects are largely old school make up: buckets of fake blood etc and I can't think of any blatant uses of poor CGI. A major bonus in my book. The gore is suitable for a tale of this nature and there's probably enough of it going around to keep most of you gorehounds happy for a while!

As stated earlier, The Devil's Rock only has a few core members of cast. I would suggest that this is one of the film's strongest points since it allows the story to develop nicely without having to examine a multitude of characters motives behind their actions and allows the leads to develop further than two-dimensional stereotypes.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and if I am to find fault with it, it would have to lie with the lighting and lack of suspense or scares. At times I felt the set pieces could have used with just a little less light, creating a bit more of a foreboding atmosphere. I would suggest that this is a small complaint and if you like your horror with a bit more story than your usual splatterfest, this film should make its way into your DVD collection.",1352678400,,2809,4.699186991869919
4988972,3,B006H3KR3E,"Films continue to explore the Nazi/occult connection. Some have been more successful than others. This one is Okay but it probably won't stick with you.

Here's the scoop. It's the day before the Allies invade Europe and two Kiwi commandos are on one of the channel Islands to take down a ""Guns of Navarone"" size cannon. They hear horrible screams from the attached bunker. One wants to investigate to maybe save whomever he thinks might be being tortured. The other figures they should blow the gun and hit the road. They investigate and find the Nazis have a secret weapon in the form of a demon. Things go downhill from there.

This is not a bad watch. It needed a bit more time (this runs at a trim 83 minutes) and a better script to develop the history the hero (Captain Ben Grogan) had with his now deceased wife, and his situation with the one remaining Nazi officer. This is at the heart of the film because the captain's depression over the loss of his wife is what the demon plays off. And the developing relationship between the captain and the Nazi officer, to deal with the situation, is what is supposed to be building up the tension. It just needed a bit more room and time to breathe.

The production values were as good as they had to be. The acting was decent enough. Craig Hall did a decent job as the Kiwi captain. I needed a bit more out of Matthew Sunderland as the Nazi officer but they were good overall. The demon makeup was pretty good and the gore effects on the dead Nazi soldiers were pretty good. One of the sad things was that every couple of scenes they would do an exterior shot of the bunker itself and that had way more character and mood than what was happening inside. It's a dark time in a movie when the the shots of an inanimate object outweigh the action.

That being said, if you're a real horror fan this will be a decent enough watch. If you need more meat on the bone you may want to take a pass.",1351123200,,1941,4.324175824175824

You've read the other reviews here so I won't continue to spoil the plot but the film is elevated by strong performances by its actors and awesome makeup effects making this a gripping 96 minute experience. Entertainment One delivers it in a nice 2.35 transfer with great Dolby Surround Sound.  Campion brings up the idea of the Germans winning the war by Demonology and makes the absurdity of the situation all the more nightmarish by having the action unfolding amidst claustrophobic sets and gory makeup effects as our female Femm Verra played by Gina Varella incinerates the screen shape shifting her way to cult status.

Somehow, the demon summoned by the Nazis to win World War II is the ultimate weapon - except for the fact that she can be shackled with ordinary iron shackles, and then is completely powerless. That leaves the surviving soldier, and his Nazi captor, to BICKER, for the bulk of the endless 86 minutes. Tedium ensues...and when the demon finally stops shape-shifting into the soldier's dead wife - gee, where have we seen THAT before? - and shows her true red horned self, she looks like a pissed-off extra from HELLBOY.
