5910779,2,B00EF1PLV8,"Nov 30 2015 Update: Ordered this again trying to give Amazon a second chance but it was no good. Yes it arrived in a slightly better condition but I just can't stand it. These box sets are not cheap and there should be some surety that they would come in a great condition. Returning....again :(

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the show and I'm so excited that there's a boxset. I preordered this the moment it was announced, even before the release was announced. When I got an email saying it was shipped I drove myself crazy on the UPS site minding it's progress to my door. It came when I had had a terrible day at work and I had hoped it would improve my spirits. But when I opened it the box was mangled and torn. Even one of the disc cases was cracked and when I tried to place the disc that was inside of it, it would skip and freeze. It breaks my heart that I couldn't give a 5 star review as of yet. Will try again but not for a while.",1415664000,13,931,4.005376344086022

5910781,5,B00EF1PLV8,"4 1/2 STARS FOR A WONDERFUL SERIES WHO'S STRENGHTS ARE ALSO SOMETIMES IT'S WEAKNESSES  --- LIGHT ENOUGH FOR YOUTH AND DARK ENOUGH TO BE ENJOYED BY MANY ADULTS  -- SEE BELOW FOR BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE BOX SET

***I will not give away anything for those who have not seen the series***

BASIC PREMISE: I say heavy magic in my title because the fantasy element is quite strong.  Some people may prefer a more down to earth approach.  However, this Arthurian based series is meant to be mostly family friendly with a great deal of humorous fun.  Per the director's commentary, they take the four primary characters of Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere and Morgana, and begin them all in early adulthood as yet undeveloped peers striving to find their place in life.  The very general story arcs are quite familiar and comfortable to Arthurian lore, while a great deal of dramatic license is taken with the individual characters and day to day tales.  Merlin is not yet a great sorcerer, but knows he was born with magic.  Arthur is obviously a prince, but young, brattish, and athletic, yet good hearted underneath.  Morgana is a ward of King Uther as her own father Gorlois is long dead.  She is a beautiful princess of Camelot, yet she is troubled with disturbing dreams.  Guinevere is the most changed as she starts our tale as a servant to Morgana.  Uther has outlawed magic in the kingdom because of tragedies we learn at a later time.  Thus, Merlin must keep his magic a secret or risk being put to death.  He travels to Camelot to seek his destiny while also becoming Arthur's manservant.  They begin almost as enemies, yet develop a rapport and a sort of comedic foil to play off each other.  Merlin must play somewhat a fool to keep from being discovered, yet Arthur also sees a certain wisdom in his young friend.

ARCS & CONFLICTS:  Keeping the magic a secret is a very fundamental conflict of the story as Merlin continually saves Arthur's life, while using magic.  This conflict is important to creating the dramatic tension in the show, yet drags on quite long after five seasons.  However, the show excels on the strength of it's characters and casting.  We see each of these main characters and the supporting cast grow into their destinies and powers.  Merlin learns of his destiny to pair with Arthur and save Albion.  He is mentored by kindly Gaius, the sage court physician, and an ancient dragon imprisoned below Camelot.  Arthur grows from the athletic jerk into the ruler who knows the world around him must change.  Morgana comes to understand her dark secret and the true background of her father's demise.  Guinevere finds that life can offer more than just being a servant.

THE ACTORS:  The primary four actors were mostly unknown, but Colin Morgan really pulls off the balance of being a bit foolish on one hand, but believably powerful and responsible when he needs to exert himself.  This is key to the whole show.  For me though, I really found Katie McGrath as Morgana carrying a huge chunk of the interest as she manages some fairly strong conflicts in the personality of her character.  She really has the dark haired, pale faced, other worldly look of a Morgana.  Richard Wilson makes a wonderful and fatherly Gaius that is easy to love.  John Hurt as the last dragon and narrator of the show is positively perfect.  All the knights of the round table also become more and more fleshed out as the series grows.  One other character I really loved was Emilia Fox as Morgause.  I was surprised at what a hard, yet stunningly beautiful sorceress she made.  A one episode appearance by Holliday Grainger was pretty cool too!  Another big star of the show is the beautiful Chteau de Pierrefonds itself, which serves as the castle of Camelot.  What an amazing castle!

BOX SET AND NEW EXTRAS(REVIEWED BLU-RAY VERSION):  All the special features are carted over with the old discs.  In addition, you receive a sixth disc in it's own case with two more special features not seen before.  One is a San Diego 2012 Comic Con panel interview with the actors representing Merlin, Guinevere, and Morgana.  The second is a short titled The Real Merlin & Arthur.  This second short is a brief, very informal discussion of the historical origins and sights in Wales associated with the legend.  As with the original extras, these are probably most interesting to ultimate fans where other people may not be as interested.  The Comic Con panel was interesting just to see the actors out of character and interacting with fans.  I found them a little more interesting than the video diaries that were in the individual releases.  Mainly they discuss the transition into season 5 which was soon to come at that time.  The historical Arthur short was a little disappointing as it's nothing more than a road trip and hand cam featuring Colin Morgan an Bradly James driving in a car and talking.  They make a few significant stops and talk to local experts and characters about their take on the legend.  They take back roads and consistently arrive late which limits their access to sites that on occasion cannot be seen.  Very little scholarly content other than comments from the guy at the library in Mold, Wales. If you already bought the individual releases, I don't know if this package is worth the upgrade unless you want to condense.  I bought the original UK releases which are quite chunky.  Some of the US original releases were also a little thick and fold out style - though quite attractive, so this set will be nice to consolidate, or less lavish depending on your viewpoint.  For the right price, eventually it may be an economical choice.

Sadly this series came to an end after just five seasons and likely would have lasted longer with just a little tweaking to the formula.  You probably would not be on this page if you were not a fan of the Arthurian legends.  So, as long as you like a stronger fantasy element and a little slapstick now and then, you will almost certainly love this series.  I highly recommend it!",1413072000,47,6043,4.6971428571428575
5910782,5,B00EF1PLV8,"This rating is for the show which I happened on  by accident and was hooked.  Hopefully I can edit this after this set comes out I tried to buy the single seasons and the lousy packaging scratched the heck out of them  I gave up.  If this really comes out all on blu ray I am so psyched!  Many forums said they would never do the early shows blu but this set should be incredible and worth my year long wait.
Update: We r on season 4 of the blu rays and the show is even better than I remember.  Yes some may say it had a young target audience but it is refreshing to see a tv show without people cannibalizing each other and other gore.  I give this my highest rating.  Keep in mind this is for content I am not a videophile and am watching on a 720 p tv but the quality of the set seems to b much better in every way to standard DVD. ..

5910790,1,B00EF1PLV8,"This review is for the Blu-ray set specifically, and not the show. The show is fantastic and I'd give it a 5 star review all around for the same reasons as the other reviewers.

The Blu-ray set has done a decent job with the video and it looks great, especially the last two seasons. However, the audio quality for the first 3 seasons is horrible. It's very 'tinny' and there is a constant vibration or echo that makes it sound like it's being played through a long tube. I find it so distracting that I won't even watch the first 3 seasons on Blu-ray, and watch the DVDs instead.

If this hadn't been a gift that I waited too long to open I would have returned it. I'm very disappointing in this product and can't recommend it to others.",1511049600,3,738,4.302158273381295

I gave this 4 stars because of the physical packaging this was shipped to me. It wasn't damaged, but the materials used are kind of cheap and the detailed work is not up to par for paying so much for the full series. Some of the DVD cases don't match up, like I had bought them separately and not all together. The stickers while fun, are not well made and easily peel. The art on the DVD's themselves are of lower quality and not perfectly fitted so a couple look off. The extras while nice are also low quality. I have no idea why someone approved some of them to be on their boxset for this great series, but it does the show a disservice.

Other than that, I am still really happy I purchased the show. The show is great and I just wish its packaging had had enough care put into it to match.",1477958400,2,1074,4.183574879227053

5910828,5,B00EF1PLV8,"This show is so addictive and wonderful. It is truly a show that can be enjoyed as a family. I have 11 and 8 year old daughters and it is appropriate for their ages. It is a well written and humorous series. There are lighthearted episodes and then there are intense and emotional episodes. The emotional facial expressions of the character Merlin astonish me. You will fall in love with his depth of emotion and character.
In the beginning Arthur is not a likable character but that doesn't last long. He develops his own very humorous and emotional facial expressions and you will love him as well. We have chosen to watch an episode of Merlin any chance we get to view something as a family. I will be sad when we have seen all of the episodes but I am extremely happy that there are such a number of them.
I cannot recommend this series enough especially since there is such a lack of family television to enjoy (not to mention the cringe worthy commercials to sit through).  We don't have DVR nor cable tv. We are plenty pleased with PBS and streaming shows of our choosing.
Thankfully there is someone out there that knows how to write good television without just making a new crime series or young adult series with no moral values. I can't say there is no potty humor though, the 2 episodes titled ""Beauty and the Beast"" are the culprits containing the fart jokes but they are hilarious!",1468108800,2,1396,4.496062992125984

Realizing of course that King Arthur does die the way it is written by scholars but he didn't need to do so in this series. There were lots of other things that bend the ""rule"" such as Guin being a servant and not of noble blood but yet she becomes Queen. The way Sir Lancolot died is not how it happens in the original text, etc etc....so why kill off Arthur before he had a chance to fulfill some of his promises to his people? Sad so sad that it ended the way it did...VERY VERY Disappointed.",1452643200,,617,4.237288135593221

5910877,5,B00EF1PLV8,"Finally, the complete series at a more or less reasonable price.  If you are a fan, this may be your best chance.  If not, you might borrow a season from the local library first to check in out.  This series seems to strike a good balance between clever drama, fun dumb-history and fantasy, and action.  It is never too violent or frightening, but does have good elements of suspense and danger.  None of these episodes will leave you with the task of making awkward explanations to the kiddies.",1452297600,,495,4.579545454545454
5910878,5,B00EF1PLV8,"I discovered this BBC TV series on Hulu recently and loved it.  Apparently it ran from 2008 to 2012, on NBC for one year and the SyFy channel for 4 years.  Really glad I found it and would highly recommend it.  Terrific, likeable cast, creative and interesting stories, lots of action-adventure sequences, beautiful sets, and some romance. The heart of the show is the relationship between young Merlin, who needs to keep his magic a secret as he fulfills his destiny of protecting Arthur, and young Arthur as he goes from being a rude, insensitive prince to a noble and worthy king. Colin Morgan was outstanding as Merlin, Bradley James was gorgeous as Arthur (with and without his shirt), and their comic banter throughout the series was great.  The show has some of the same elements as ""Game of Thrones,"" but is much more family-friendly, so no bloody beheadings, explicit brothel scenes, or incest, which is fine by me.

The price of this DVD box set varies a lot on Amazon.  I bought it for $10 less than what they're charging this week.  I couldn't justify the additional $40 for the Blu Ray version.  Many of the special features, including the ""Secrets and Magic"" Behind the Scenes footage, are available on Hulu or online (the Comic Con interviews), but I enjoy owning the series and look forward to watching favorite episodes again.  I am also looking forward to seeing the deleted scenes on the Bonus Features disk, which I haven't seen anywhere else.",1449100800,3,1463,4.75098814229249

The picture and sound is outstanding, especially seasons 4 & 5 when Merlin moved to BBCHD.
Seasons 1 - 3 also look superb although I think they may be a SD upscale.

5910968,5,B00EF1PLV8,"I was tentative about ordering this fantastic series due to some shaky reviews on the quality of the product when they received it. The box was a little creased in one corner, but it was the DVD's I was concerned about. I eagerly popped one in and HUZZAH they work beautifully!

This is probably my favorite TV series. The first episode is really, quite terrible. My mother and I watched it and couldn't bear the corny dialogue and gave up on it. Months later we came back and watched the second episode and thought ""Not as bad."" Suddenly it was the highlight of my day and each night I couldn't wait to sit down.

The first season is quite cheesy. But somewhere around the season 2 finale something kicks in. Season 3 makes you wonder if you're even watching the same show. And from then on out it just gets tenser and more complex and more emotional.

I recently rewatched the entire series with my niece. It was just as good, if not, better than watching it the first time. The foreshadowing adds such a tragic and sometimes humorous aspect to things. Also you can hear more of the witty dialogue or catch little details you had forgotten.

The characters seem shallow at first. However this works in the shows favor, since you can watch them grow in character and maturity before your eyes. You get to see each character come in to their own - be it a hero or a villain.

The ending is a source of conflict among Merlin fans... I personally think it held true to the origins of the Arthurian legend and created something impossibly beautiful and sad. But not without hope.

Its's not a perfect series. The first 2 seasons are rough. There are a couple plot holes here and there. But I love it for the rich characters the well written story.

(as a bonus, it's totally PG-13 except towards the ends where things start leaning heavily towards darker areas concerning torture, no gore or gruesome details, just the heavy element of suggestion that is effectively used - it depends on what you're used to)",1436227200,25,2005,4.5220994475138125

5911016,5,B00EF1PLV8,"If you were ever in a middle school English class, you are familiar with the tales of King Arthur, the once and future king, and his trials and tribulations in ruling over the legendary land of Camelot. All throughout his reign, Arthur always had by his side the all-powerful wizard, Merlin. These tales showcase magic, resilience, good battling against evil, and equality. Essentially, these are the perfect components to be adapted for a BBC TV series.

Merlin began in 2008 by the genius of Julian Jones, Jake Michie, Johnny Capps, and Julian Murphy, some of the minds behind other TV shows like
Atlantis, Robin Hood, Demons, and Hex.

While loosely referencing the canonical stories of King Arthur, Merlin was modified for a younger audience, which resulted in some interesting plot changes. In the TV series, the character Merlin is not depicted as the typical, elderly man with a long, white beard, shrouded in a deep blue cloak that most people are all familiar with. To please a younger audience, Merlin is played by young Colin Morgan, a 29-year-old Irish actor who wooed Merlin fanatics with his oversized ears, wide grin, and his abiding sense of loyalty to young Prince Arthur.

Yes, Prince Arthur is played by Bradley James, a young English actor known for his portrayal of the snotty, entitled, teenaged Prince Arthur. Despite these off-putting qualities, as the series goes on Prince Arthur grows into a man fit to take the throne.

In this story line, young Merlin is the manservant to Prince Arthur, all the while hiding the fact that his destiny is to become the most powerful wizard ever to exist to protect Arthur from all dangers and help him to become king of Camelot. This secret represents itself in Prince Arthur constantly undervaluing poor Merlin in many absolutely hilarious ways, while Merlin stealthily saves the day time and time again.

When he isn't ordering Merlin to polish his armor or draw him a bath, Arthur is being groomed for the throne by his father, the current king of Camelot, Uther Pendragon. By Uther's command, magic has been outlawed from Camelot, making it impossible for Merlin to own up to his potential. Horrific amounts of blood are spilled in the persecution of anyone who dares practice magic.

Widely hated by the magic community, Uther refuses to change the law because he clings to the belief that his wife's life was ended by magic. Because of this, Merlin sees in Arthur the opportunity to show him that magic may also be used for good and steer him away from the opinions of his jaded father. Other literary characters such as Lancelot, Guinevere, Morgana, and Mordred also appear in the TV series, with some revisions from folklore.

Action packed seasons full of family betrayal, forbidden love, and powerful magic make this TV series compelling. Merlin is five seasons long and the tortured audience members are definitely left wanting more. I am a full-blown fan of this TV show and don't have anything bad to say about it, besides the fact that it ended.

All episodes are available for streaming on Netflix. If this type of fantastical adventure genre appeals to you, similar TV series include Doctor Who, Smallville, Game of Thrones, and Robin Hood.",1422230400,6,3218,4.891743119266055

5911019,4,B00EF1PLV8,A fantastically entertaining series finally available on blu-ray. A big disappointment was that only seasons four and five meet the hi-def quality bar. The first three seasons were shot on 16mm stock instead of the 35mm used for seasons 4-5. So while most scenes look good they do lack some detail. Grain is especially noticeable in dark scenes. Seasons 4-5 are breathtakingly gorgeous to watch. Worth the purchase.,1420675200,14,415,5.117647058823529

5911024,4,B00EF1PLV8,"Saw this on sale when Amazon had a BBC sale - hesitant to get the regular DVDs because of earlier reviews but since I was buying this for someone who does not have a Blu-Ray player, had to get the regular version. Good deal at 40% off listed price for full set of 5 seasons plus the bonus DVD.

Received package quickly with Prime membership and it was packaged well. No external damage to the package and I quickly inspected the discs for scratches. So far, no major scratches except for some dirt in 2-3 of the DVDs and in Season 4 one of the DVD had a broken disc holder. Will have to play the DVDs to see if all of them plays clearly. I have tested the 1st season, watched 3 episodes and so far so good! Of course, it is an enjoyable TV series to watch!

I will update my review if I encounter problems with the set after I have gone through all 5 seasons plus the bonus DVD.",1420070400,8,879,4.07514450867052

The show is very innocent but I cannot recommend it enough. Simply Amazing! Years later and -- We still cannot get over this show!",1419811200,2,223,4.6

5911029,5,B00EF1PLV8,"This is one of my very favorite shows and I'm so glad that they came out with this collection because I discovered this show on Netflix so I didn't have any of it. I do have a few issues about series 5 (I won't tell what the issues are), I'm sure everyone does, but in a way that's good. It shows that people really get into the story and care about what happens and the emotional state of certain characters. Beware: this show is extremely addicting make sure you have a lot of free time before sitting down to watch.",1417910400,6,518,4.19

5911031,4,B00EF1PLV8,"Based on the reviews within this forum, I decided to not risk buying the normal DVD box set and purchase the Blu-ray box set. Even though the Blu-ray is almost twice the cost, Blu-rays are known to be more scratch resistant. The Blu-ray box set came in the mail with minor damage on the box, but had no damage on the included discs. I have included the images that show minor damage along the corners of the product. I viewed each disc and each disc was in great condition. I would recommend purchasing the blu-ray box set.",1417478400,24,523,4.402061855670103

5911034,3,B00EF1PLV8,"This is fine if you completely ignore everything about the Arthurian legends. Some of these characters have the same name as the ones in the legends, and that's about it. Don't look at this as any sort of realistic depiction of history, either. If you don't mind Merlin saying things like ""No way!"" then knock yourself out.",1416441600,3,323,4.684210526315789
5911035,1,B00EF1PLV8,"The Merlin Series is awesome and I would have loved to have it, and to give it as a gift this holiday season, but there is a BIG PROBLEM with quality of the discs.  Producer of this product has extremely poor quality control. To have received two sets with similar problems is really dismal indeed.  Several discs have an uneven film on them, some discs are scratched or smeared; a center of one disc holder is broken, and most disc holders have a greasy film on them.  Definitely a huge disappointment.",1416268800,20,503,4.5054945054945055
