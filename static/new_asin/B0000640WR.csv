I wish it was on DVD .",1439683200,,87,3.4
7960181,4,B0000640WR,"Good stretch, and poses.  Makes a great start to any day.  Easy enough for a beginner but enough challenge for an intermediate yoga student too.",1355702400,,144,4.72
7960182,2,B0000640WR,"After seeing how highly rated this video was here, I decided to see for myself. So I went out and bought it. Well, I must say, I had a totally different experience:  I didn't like it very much! Though I found the instructor Kim Haegele to be very friendly and clear in her directions, I did think that she could've been even more so.  Because this was allegedly aimed at beginner's, I think it would've been far more helpful to have someone else besides the instructor demonstrating the modified poses, as opposed to just occasionally flashing them on the screen and hoping that we'll remember them!  Needless to say, by the end of the tape, I felt more nauseous and confused than relaxed.  For a tape that is truly accessible to the beginning student, I recommend Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga as an alternative.",1026691200,6,809,4.636363636363637
7960183,5,B0000640WR,"Although Kim's new tape is designed for beginners, I bought it because I'd enjoyed her earlier tape so much. Now I'm ordering a second copy because I gave the first one away to a visitor recently.
Kim's routines are easy to follow, and the fusion program as she interprets it is a good addition to any yoga routine.
I'm looking forward to her third tape!",1024790400,5,354,4.461538461538462
