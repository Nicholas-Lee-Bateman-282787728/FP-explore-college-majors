8641186,1,B00ID8HDVA,I have this on VHS which is fine but this DVD version is a BAD MASTER & most definitely defective!  Constant AUDIO STATIC & PICTURE ROLLING throughout documentary. I would be embarrassed if I was the one responsible for this DVD production. Obviously someone did not care enough to check the master DVD before production of this classic on DVD. Don't waste your money fans unless you can put up with HIGH AUDIO STATIC and can deal with ROLLING PICTURE.,1513296000,,452,4.65
8641187,5,B00ID8HDVA,Let's face it...Scream Queens are like Rock Stars.  If you like their work you are going to love everything and anything that is out there that celebrates their work!  Some folks don't get it...which explains the lower ratings of this video...but if you love these films and these actresses you are going to love this film!,1440374400,2,323,4.75

8641190,5,B00ID8HDVA,"I remember a long time ago watching this on VHS and then never seeing it again, even though I wanted to (Someone stole it at the video rental store). To my surprise, it was released on DVD and nostalgia rushed over me as I watched and listened to the scream queens I loved when I was growing up. It's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination (it was directed by the infamous badfilm director Donald Farmer), but it serves its purpose and there are some nice extras. A shout out to Dan Kinem for making me aware of this DVD and his participation in getting it released on DVD.",1404345600,4,585,4.232142857142857
