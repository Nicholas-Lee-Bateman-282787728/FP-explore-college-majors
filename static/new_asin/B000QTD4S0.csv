8197263,5,B000QTD4S0,The Maigret mysteries are wonderful.  Bruno Cremer is one of the best actors at being Maigret.  You do need a region free or 2 DVD player to view these.,1295395200,5,152,4.206896551724138
8197264,3,B000QTD4S0,"It was great discovering these boxed sets which I bought from FNAC and the sub-titles presented no problems. However, given the massive investment made to produce such a number of episodes ( there are several boxed sets ) a huge opportunity was missed to set down a classic Maigret series. Why? Well first of all there is no Madame Maigret and she is such an important part of the Maigret stories, almost as much as Lucas, Janvier and Lapointe, that to exclude her detracts from the general Maigret persona. Secondly, the production values, in particular the theme music, are too American and resemble far too much a 1960's Perry Mason. It's not that I want corny French music for the sake of it but this is supposed to be France after all and the music did not reflect this. Also, Simenon was famous for creating a sense of Paris with all its sights and smells and yet too few of the episodes are the Parisian ones. Perhaps they didn't think it possible to film in modern day Paris but I would dispute that because knowing Paris fairly well I am convinced that some good locations could have been found. Or was it just a question of cost? Also, the opening sequences are far too close to the Rupert Davies ones and could have been more original. Having said all of the above I think that Bruno Cremer was a good Maigret and they are enjoyable but about 15 mins too long. Inevitably some of the stories have been adapted but in itself that is no bad thing. A useful and worth watching addition to the Maigret catalogue but not a classic intrepretation.

8197265,5,B000QTD4S0,This production doesn't disappoint.  Region 2 and PAL format means a region-free PAL/NTSC player is required but easily available.  French with English subtitles allow you to practice your French without missing any of the dialogue.,1221782400,3,232,5.6
8197266,3,B000QTD4S0,"If you want well crafted period piece whodunnits set in a faultlessly recreated postwar France, then this is for you.  If you want Simenon's Maigret, who is an intuitive rather than a deductive sleuth, and whose skill lies in wearing down the individual he instinctively suspects in a mental combat, then this is NOT for you.  The stories are almost unrecognizable for any Simenon fanatic, merely situations and names being transferred into someone else's story.  I found it very irritating watching the stories I remembered best, but quite enjoyed the ones I had forgotten. But they are not Maigret.  At least Bruno Cremer, who stars in this French production, is physically like Maigret, with a portrayal of size and stolidity, and an obvious fondness for humanity and our foibles.  Poor Simenon: his Maigret characters and stories have only ever been brought convincingly to life once, in the BBC Rupert Davies series from the late 50's.  And the BBC refuse to release them in any form.",1221091200,7,989,4.963636363636364
8197267,5,B000QTD4S0,"For those of us who love the Georges Simenon's Chief Inspector Maigret, it was a real treat to find these dvds!  We're avid fans of the books and especially of the BBC's Michael Gambon series, but there were only two seasons filmed and in seeking any other possible productions of Maigret we came across this boxed set.  Ordered them immediately, after all if anyone should be able to make a believable film of Maigret stories it should be the French!

Well they didn't disappoint!  There are ten discs, each with a different episode that is about 80 to 90 minutes.  A few extras are provided including a piece on who Simenon was.  English subtitles, though your remote's subtitle button doesn't work on these, you have to go into 'versions' and click on the one that says in Francais with English titles.  And yes, this is for all region players, but most new ones either already are or can easily be made all region with the right code, just go to google and type in all region dvd codes.

The actor, Bruno Cremer, who plays Maigret is right up there with Gambon and that is saying something!",1201651200,13,1094,4.545918367346939
