8249468,3,B000O1O740,Hard to follow...  A little to weird for me.  It came highly recommended and I kept waiting for it to get better...?,1368144000,,116,4.2272727272727275
8249469,5,B000O1O740,"This is a movie that must be watched...  To be viewed, to be studied, to be seen.  The more you watch this movie the more you will find in it.  The layers are as complex as Blade Runner, but in the time of a short sitting.  The concept that the Screen Door Films has put together allows the one act play concept to be brought home on an iPod/iPhone/iPad and resonate with the clarity of a main line feature film.  With the production being shot in HD, all of the set, and the characters in it are allowed to develop fully.  With the strength of the actors involved, the picture is given depth and substance that will immerse the viewer in questions, but leave THEM to find the answers.  If you are looking for a popcorn film, put this one down, it will frustrate you.  However, if you are looking for the equivalent of a novella with the viewing time of a short airline flight, this is a picture for you.

Look forward to more coming out from this production company, the content and concept are what the next mobile generation will truly be able to appreciate.

Great suspense and awesome cinematography.  The music is soothing and mesmerizing and fits the mood of the movie to a ""T"".
