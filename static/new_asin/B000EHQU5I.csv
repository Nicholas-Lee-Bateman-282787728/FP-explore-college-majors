8109937,5,B000EHQU5I,I love this movie. It has my two favorite latino actors Esai Morales & Cristian de la Fuente. I can't stop watching it.,1437868800,,119,4.217391304347826
8109938,4,B000EHQU5I,"I enjoyed this movie, as will most people who like Latino customs and culture.  The storyline isn't overly heavy, so don't expect big-time problems of the world to be discussed here.  It's fine in the genre of ""wedding movie"", like so many other comedies.
My only regret is that Rosanna De Soto didn't have a larger role, as she is genuinely entertaining when the script allows for it(like the hilarious character she plays in ""Mambo Cafe"".  Overall, I found it worth the money and the time spent to watch Once Upon A Wedding.",1402790400,,526,4.634408602150538
8109939,3,B000EHQU5I,Silly fun from very gifted actors.  I wouldn't mind seeing more films of this ilk.  A. Martines & Esai Morales deserve more work in H'wood,1385596800,,138,4.48
8109940,5,B000EHQU5I,"the movie was adventurous, romantic...just everything i would want to watch. i recomend this to anyone looking for a romantic comedy",1233273600,2,132,5.333333333333333
8109941,5,B000EHQU5I,"It was a very pleasant surprise. I bought it because of Dancing With The Stars Cristian De La Fuente. I didn't know anything about him. I knew Morales and Martinez, both very fine actors. I liked it very much and would highly recommend it.",1209772800,4,239,4.454545454545454
8109942,2,B000EHQU5I,"About to embark on an arranged marriage, the daughter of a Caribbean dictator (Charlotte Ayana) crashes into a poor fisherman (Kuno Becker). Injured, she brings him home to the mansion, where he continues to hurt himself so he can stay and she fights her attraction to the inappropriate suitor while getting ready for her wedding. Meanwhile, the commandant (A Martinez) is off in his own little world since losing his beloved wife, unaware that there is something fishy going on with his government.

The acting is pretty bad, with accents all over the place (and a camera fixated on Ayanna's light blue eyes which appeared scary at times). I had a hard time with Esai Morales in this comedy role - he is funny, but not in here - it was like he was channeling Raul Julia as Gomez Adams - a poor imitation at that. It's basically a cheesy Lifetime movie that isn't even good enough for repeat viewings on LMN.",1186358400,5,908,4.604938271604938
8109943,2,B000EHQU5I,"I rented this film and it sounded somewhat interesting but I was severely disappointed. While the film making was well done for the most part the story itself was very formulaic and a paint by the numbers. I felt that any crew fresh out of film school could have slapped this together and probably have done a better job. So if you are into prince and the pauper romantic comedies mixed with a little bit of fantasy you'll enjoy it, otherwise pick another film.",1151625600,3,461,4.5
8109944,4,B000EHQU5I,"This movie was on Flix this morning, and I was surprised at how good it was--I'd never heard of it. A. Martinez is just hilarious playing the, shall we say, ""delusional"" commandante. Esai Morales is a great comedy villain, and the young romance is gentle and sweet.

Like ""The Fantasticks,"" there's an innocence to the goings-on, and when the Commandante's daughter finally sees the poor side of her island, her eyes are opened. Gives the film a lovely Capra-esquire quality, when the classes bump against each other in a great comedic clash.

It won't bump the greatest movies of all time off the list, but it's a lighthearted romp with a lot of heart and uplift, a real find.",1147219200,7,677,4.680672268907563
