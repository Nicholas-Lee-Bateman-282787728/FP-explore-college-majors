7979577,4,B000087F5E,"All the individual stories were interesting, but some more so than others. Certain segments also seemed a bit short and less in-depth compared to others.

The music used made the whole thing feel a bit 'whimsical', like a 50's TV show. In the 'extras' section, I enjoyed seeing the rare footage of RVD kissing Million Dollar Man's foot for a couple Benjamin's.

It was also enjoyable listening to Al Snow explain how he broke into the business.  The old-time trainers had a very sadistic streak and the stories are always cringe-worthy to hear.",1336003200,,544,4.827956989247312
7979578,5,B000087F5E,Volume 2 is alot better than Volume 1.  But...each one is based on which Super Stars are your favorite.,1229817600,,103,4.421052631578948
7979579,4,B000087F5E,"Just picked this up at wal-mart. They had tons of them. The price? how about $3.88!! So, don't pay to much for it here. This DVD is only worth a couple of bucks!",1169596800,2,161,3.909090909090909
7979580,2,B000087F5E,"It is informative, however it is something that you watch once get a kick out of a few things, and that's it. I would have liked to see more about the beginnings of their careers and not about their barbers, eating disorders, and haloween costumes. I should have rented this and not bought it.",1047945600,5,293,4.444444444444445

7979582,5,B000087F5E,"Even more no-holds-barred interviews, backed up with tons of exclusive footage! Learn what Brock Lesnar, Rob Van Dam, Chris Jericho, Torrie Wilson, Shawn Michaels, Tazz, Al Snow, John Cena, Randy Orton and Christopher Nowinski did before joining WWE and becoming world-famous celebrities and WWE Superstars. This DVD gets 5 stars only because Brock Lesnar and Shawn Michaels steal the DVD and help it out. Rob Van Dam, Chris Jericho, Torrie Wilson, Tazz, and Al Snow do contribute and provide some entertaining bits of business to the DVD. The only snooze fest aspect of this DVD is the fact that John Cena, Randy Orton and Christopher Nowinski are included in a title like Before They Were WWE Superstars 2, Cena and Orton are still working to establish them selfs as Superstars. And Old Yellow Tooth Nowinski is and will forever be a NOBODY. Instead of Yellow Tooth they should have included Maven. Extras include ring debuts, Nowinski's Tough Enough audition tape(Snore)and young RVD kissing the feet of the 'Million-Dollar Man' Ted DiBiase. Approx. running time for this DVD is 2.5 hrs. All in all one great DVD, minus the two afore mentioned new guys and the one nobody.",1044576000,3,1175,4.969543147208122
