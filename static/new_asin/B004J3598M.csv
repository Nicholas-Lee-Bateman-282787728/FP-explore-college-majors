Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.

This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good. Ikki Tousen is a very entertaining anime to watch, but as I said it's main purpose is fan service.",1354665600,2,734,4.357664233576642
