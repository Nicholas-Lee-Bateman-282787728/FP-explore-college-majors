7956979,5,B00005YQY5,"This is a great dvd of songs performed at two concerts - House of Blues in Chicago and Luther Allison's Madison Gothic Theater in Denver.  I think both shows were in 2001.  This dvd is not of either concert from beginning to end.  Instead, it is 10 songs recorded live and the production alternates between the 2 shows - 5 songs from each show.  It is song after song, rapid fire, with no BS -- just great blues rock!  In addition, it is one of the rare opportunities to see the original band, which was all family members -- Mato Nanji (Strat), his sister (drums), his brother (bass), and his cousin (congas/percussion).

Regarding the production, video is great, though it is film-like as opposed to life-like.  Some concert dvds are like you're right there - others you can tell were filmed and then transferred to dvd.  This one seems like the latter.  The quality of the audio is very good, but not as great as others.  All that said, I wouldn't part with this dvd!  It is a great view of the original band!  The only other that I know of is on VHS called Indigenous Live at La Zona Rosa.  I have it also, and I prefer the audio of that tape to this dvd.  Kind of splitting hairs -  I love both and watch both frequently.

If you are a fan of Hendrix, Santana, Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Black Crowes (first album Black Crowes - not later), Billy Gibbons, Robin Trower, then you will likely enjoy the music of this band, as you can hear their influences in Mato's playing.  If you're like me and you enjoy seeing concert footage of great guitarists, this one is my favorite guitarist of the last 4 decades.  Mato Nanji is really something special!  He is not just an incredible expressive guitarist, but a great writer, and a singer with a lot of soul. I highly recommend Indigenous to everyone that loves their blues with a rock hard edge.

If you have the opportunity, go see him play live!  I've seen him many times and he has never played the same set list twice.  He has written a lot of great music.  A link to their website is below for their tour schedule.

7956981,5,B00005YQY5,If you love SRV then you'll love these guys cause they loved Stevie too and their music proves it!  Excellent band that picked up where Stevie left off...,1382400000,,154,4.5
7956982,5,B00005YQY5,"I have seen Indigenous and Mato w/o Indigenous. He is one of the BEST Guitarist today. I have seen him at least six (6) times. I agree with the other Reviewer that Mato has been understated. Because he is not MainStream he has not gotten the attention he deserves. I have seen some great guitarists in my time including Jimi Hendrix who will always be my favorite. Jimi was the ORIGINAL Blues Innovator,and Mato follows in that vein. When he does Red House you would surely agree.

A friend gave me an audio copy of this DVD and I just love it. Somehow Mato is not playing much these days and I crave to hear and see him play once again. I wanted to order this DVD and now it is not available. I just hope that soon it will be. If you want to get introduce to Mato's music or have seen hin live(which is the BEST) I recommend getting this DVD if they get it back in stock.",1318723200,,872,4.129411764705883
7956983,5,B00005YQY5,"Indigenous was and is a band that deserved/s main stream play.  Mato, the lead guitarist should be recognized as one of the greatest that have ever played. With a Stevie Ray Vaughan style, he surpasses anything that I have witnessed regarding Stevie. (No disrespect inteneded!)
There are quite a few guitarists out there that get ignored, such as; Walter Trout, Nick Bonamassa etc. This is the company in which Mato would be placed.
Add in the family who surround him on this early video and you have quite an amazing production.
Indigenous has changed recently and is no longer involving the family. That is why I highly reccommend this DVD. No one will probably ever get a chance to see the family perform together.
Sit back and prepare to be mesmarized.",1260144000,2,756,4.770992366412214
7956984,4,B00005YQY5,"Having seen these guys live, I can say that this DVD is a pretty accurate representation of one of their shows. The sound is good and the filming adequate. It is, however, rather short in length. This is made up for slightly by the inclusion of a few acoustic numbers from another show.",1101859200,9,286,4.415094339622642
