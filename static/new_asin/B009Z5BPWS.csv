5373950,1,B009Z5BPWS,My children and I love watching Adventure Time and record the episodes onto our DVR as they come on.  I recently decided that it would be a worthy investment to start purchasing seasons of Adventure Time on DVD.  Imagine my dismay when I saw that only season 1 was available for purchase.  Everything else is a random assortment of episodes (including this item under review).  This is what I already have on my DVR.  I would like to have the full seasons.  I will not buy these compilations.  Please release the other seasons.,1356739200,8,527,4.602150537634409
5373951,1,B009Z5BPWS,Not interested in compilation discs. Stop releasing these. We want complete seasons not samplings. There is no reason to buy  or release these.,1356739200,8,143,5.217391304347826
5373952,1,B009Z5BPWS,"When lord when. just give me season two, I also want commentary and special features, is this really much to ask?",1356307200,9,113,4.428571428571429
5373953,1,B009Z5BPWS,"Come on guys, enough is enough! Season one is on DVD. Season FIVE is currently airing. Where are the rest of the seasons? This random sampling crap is, well, crap.",1355702400,105,163,4.466666666666667
5373954,3,B009Z5BPWS,"I'm giving this a midway review, as I will be buying and loving it, but at the same time, I have to agree that we want FULL SEASON releases! They did season one so why not follow on with the others? Any one who's seen the show on TV (especially recently) will know that a lot of the episodes do follow on from one another, particularly with the Lich's story line, and the history of his arrival and even the hints to what was to come (farm boy Finn in his dream in the 'king worm' episode), I really hope the full seasons do get the release they deserve, but at the same time I will feel ripped of having brought all the random collections too, which I will continue to do for the convenience of sticking a DVD in the player! Please I any one from CN actually reads these for feed back on their products (which would make sense) listen to your fans before you lose them, for what they see as money grabbing marketing instead of quality releases!",1355097600,43,945,4.226519337016574
5373955,1,B009Z5BPWS,"I love Adventure Time, but I want full seasons. If I want random viewing I can turn on Cartoon Network or burn a  random disc myself. These random releases are a joke and should be stopped. I don't think I'm alone in this, CN simply isn't listening or doesn't care.

Most fans of the show know that the episodes often should be viewed in order, and this often enriches the overall story. The random episodes just don't deliver.",1354665600,101,427,4.461538461538462
5373956,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I love Av time so, what can i say. I mean, if they were all of fionna and cake, i would adore it! Pen Ward, theres an idea.",1354320000,3,123,3.4285714285714284
5373957,1,B009Z5BPWS,"Let me make it clear, the one star review is not of the show but of the DVD itself. I love Adventure Time. It's one of the best kids shows created, but Cartoon Network insists on screwing over the fans by releasing these volume sets. Haven't we proved that we're worthy of complete season DVDs? I'm sick of these random assortments of episodes. Until CN decides to release this fantastic show in complete seasons, I will feel no remorse for heading to the open seas to obtain them.",1354233600,144,481,4.4772727272727275

5373959,1,B009Z5BPWS,This qualifies as fraud!  There is only one Fiona and Cake episode and that's the one that was on the Season 3 disk.  All the others are recycled Finn and Jake episodes.  Wish I could get my money back.,1423094400,,202,4.128205128205129
5373960,5,B009Z5BPWS,My aunt loved that I got it for her.,1419811200,,36,3.111111111111111
5373961,2,B009Z5BPWS,only had one episode of Fionna and Cake. The other ones were the original adventure time.,1414454400,,89,4.625

5373964,1,B009Z5BPWS,"This is a very disappointing product, it is marketed as though you are buying episodes of fionna and cake, thus the cover art and title, but it only has one episode of fionna and cake. I find that very underhanded and I am quite disappointed.",1400198400,,242,4.4
5373965,5,B009Z5BPWS,"very happy with my purchase. I think Adventure Time has great story-lines, great morals and good back stories. Although it is a ""kids"" show and I am an adult I always watch the new episodes and have all of the DVDS haha! This one has some of my favorite episodes on it and it was all enjoyable.",1399161600,,294,4.175438596491228
5373966,1,B009Z5BPWS,"I love Adventure time and when I saw this DVD I was very excited! Fionna and cake episodes one one DVD! Well, that's where the enthusiasm ended because it's only the 1 episode 'Fionna and Cake' and the rest are all random Finn and Jake episodes. 'Bad Little Boy' isn't even on here. Had I know what it was going to be I would have saved my $13 and just downloaded the 2 episodes I really wanted off of iTunes. Not worth it.",1398643200,,423,4.108433734939759
5373967,1,B009Z5BPWS,Dont buy this unless you want to waste your cash. They will eventually come out with a real season 4 DVD to re-sell you episodes you already own through these 'collections' of episodes,1395705600,,184,4.606060606060606
5373968,5,B009Z5BPWS,My girls enjoyed this dvd even though it had only one Fionna and Cake episode. I just may order more of the Adventure Time dvds...,1395532800,,130,4.24
5373969,4,B009Z5BPWS,"Adventure time is way better than cake and Fionna, but this one is still pretty funny. the delivery came fast, and we got some good chuckles so four stars it is!",1395187200,,161,4.225806451612903
5373970,5,B009Z5BPWS,It made great time & was in perfect condition.  Thank you very much.  I'm looking forward to having Adventure Time make more seasons on DVD.  I think the 3rd just came out.,1393286400,,172,4.3125
5373971,2,B009Z5BPWS,I bought this hoping to see a bunch of gender bender episodes and sadly there was only one out of the entire sixteen episodes. Why call it Fiona and Cake if there's only one?,1392163200,,174,4.147058823529412
5373972,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I stated watching this carrion when it came on. As a cartoon fan, I see what's new and when I got this Dvd, I dfelt like living in the universe of Adventure Time. I like it sp much I could see it 250 times!",1390867200,,206,3.7045454545454546
5373973,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I've read a lot of bad reviews because cartoon network hasn't released more full seasons, but that actually doesn't bother me at all. I have ""My two favorite people"" and ""Fiona and Cake,"" and what I like best about them is that they were really inexpensive compared to the full seasons. I'm not saying CN shouldn't offer more full seasons, but it's nice to have these dvds as a choice as well. Plus they have a nice variety of episodes.

My son is 1 year old and absolutely LOVES adventure time! I have no idea why, but it's the only cartoon/show/movie he will actually watch. Good thing its strange enough that I like it too. I'll be buying more of these in the future!",1387497600,,670,4.403225806451613

5373975,5,B009Z5BPWS,I bought these for my daughter's bday as she is a huge fan of the show.  She loves anything AT and these are no exception.,1379289600,,122,3.88

5373978,3,B009Z5BPWS,"I found the cover and title very misleading... I had bought the product thinking that it contained Fionna and Cake episodes only, but once I got to the second episode I realized it was just regular episodes and only one Fionna and Cake episode. The only reason I didn't rate this one star is because I still liked the episodes on it, they picked a good bunch. If you wanted Fionna and Cake stuff you're better off with the comics.",1376524800,,430,4.3875
5373979,4,B009Z5BPWS,"I chose 4/5 stars because it came very quick, (but keep in mind that was because of my shipping speed) I had no problems with the software on my TV the only problem I had was that it wasn't very descriptive of what you were ""fully"" getting.

5373981,2,B009Z5BPWS,"Okay, so I am a HUGE fan of Adventure Time, and in now way mean to knock the series by not giving a full five-star review. BUT I was really disappointed because I thought this special volume was of all the Fionna & Cake episodes - which both my children AND myself adore - only to find there was only one Fionna episode. This was really misleading, and I wouldn't have spent my money on it had this been clear from the start. That said, Adventure Time remains awesome.",1369612800,8,468,4.269662921348314
5373982,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I love ADVENTURE TIME!!!

5373983,5,B009Z5BPWS,"This dvd came to me in lovely condition. The packaging was great. The only problem I had (simple and minor) was the dreaded plastic. The plastic encasing and I are mortal enemies until the end of time.
All in all, perfect condition, 5 stars!",1367798400,,241,4.5
5373984,5,B009Z5BPWS,Great episodes on this dvd just wish they would release the seasons all together but besides that im happy grear show awesome characters,1366934400,,136,4.956521739130435
5373985,5,B009Z5BPWS,"First off, cut it out with the bad reviews, dumbs***s.

I'd never seen Adventure Time, but I encounter ""Fionna and Cake"" at the comic shop, and thought, ""oh thats clever.""
So cut to me at the store, I see this DVD and think, ""sweet they put out a collection with the Fionna and Cake epsiode, and some other random episodes (as the packaging made VERY CLEAR), what a great sampler of the show.""

That said, I ended up buying Season One instead, but the show is SO GREAT, and there being no word on when Season Three will be out, I figured what the eff, it's only twelve bucks, and I really want to see that episode.
So I bought it, I effing love it, and you should buy it too.

Yes, its only the one Fionna and Cake episode, but that should be clear - ""It Came From the Nightosphere"" ""My Two Favorite People"" and ""Jake vs. Me-mow"" were all similarly titled (and do you remember them airing 16 Fionna and Cake episodes? Cause that should be your first hint...).

And Yes, cartoons come out in kid-friendly collections of random episodes, always have, always will. Collecting Seasons, watching them in order, suffering through extra features and commentary - those are all uniquely adult desires.

So BOTTOMLINE... Stop complaining, shell out the stupid 12 bucks, and when Season Three comes out next year or whatever, give this one to the neighbor kid.",1366761600,2,1350,4.56198347107438
5373986,4,B009Z5BPWS,I like it very much. My only complaint is that these non seasonal collections have repeated selections that are the same on others. About a 1/3 or more are on other DVD's which amounts to filler.,1365292800,,195,4.444444444444445
5373987,5,B009Z5BPWS,"Once again when my son was looking for Adventure Time products, he checked at Amazon first and found exactly what he was wanted.  Thank you",1365292800,,139,4.56
5373988,5,B009Z5BPWS,"Before I start,
YES I know this is a mixed episode dvd.
and some one said this was false advertisement cause there was only one Fiona and Cake episode.
it's not false advertized. on the back it says one episode then the 15 are just random episodes. for what it's worth it is a decent price. I got it for my girlfriend and she really liked it. shes not the hardcore fan who wants all the seasons but she loved it so she could put it on when she babysits her cousins and can watch with them.
As for myself, I have this, season one, and jake vs me-moth. they are all great dvds. Just suport the dvds. they release these dvds first because they want to see if any one is interested. if they sell poorly then of course they won't release the full seasons. (the toys and merch won't hold it up alone)
again the dvds are good enough on their own if you have kids over and just want to put it on. If you want to support the show then just buy both season one and this. It's great and I'm 100% satisfied",1364947200,,994,4.050761421319797
5373989,5,B009Z5BPWS,This is one of the best shows you'll ever lay your eyes on. Great for kids and adults. A must see,1364947200,,97,3.6666666666666665
5373990,3,B009Z5BPWS,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the choice of episodes on this dvd. It makes no sense to put out a Fionna & Cake dvd and not include the latest ""Bad Little Boy"" episode. Sadly, I am a die hard fan so of course I own all the dvds from Adventure Time. I hope Cartoon Network makes the perfect Adventure Time compilation dvd in the future. Mathematical!",1364774400,,357,4.424242424242424
5373991,5,B009Z5BPWS,"This was so very Amazeing Adventure time fun for me(19),Sister(16), and my brother (15). What can i say? WE LOVED IT!!!! I dident buy it off amizon tho but from walmart but ethier way it was awesome as heck :D We just loved it so much im glad we all love the show its an actul show that dose show good morals and is never really gross or crude and i like crude humor but i don't in kids shows im just upset tho lol cause the second seasson isent out yet but im waiting so bad but other then that if your a Adventure time fan You best get this dvd to add to the collection go for it!",1364601600,,582,3.8583333333333334

5373993,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I know, everyone hates the ""grab bag"" style releases that Cartoon Network has been putting out.  And yes, they are bunk.  The full seasons should (and will be) available easily, and it sucks having these little teasers.

We get it.

But for those of us neurotic enough to want all of the Adventure Time they can get, this is a really good, inexpensive treat.  The selection of episodes is really solid, and I personally think it was worth the price.  Besides, when the full seasons are out, I'm fairly certain I know someone who would be more than happy to accept hand-me-down goodness.",1363737600,,586,4.640776699029126
5373994,4,B009Z5BPWS,I know a lot of you are mad about how they won't released seasons until they made like 3 of these random collections. I would say I am upset by that too. However I think these are nice little dvds to hold us over. They are pretty cheap and are still enjoyable to watch. The alternative is to wait a year or more for the next season to come out and if you want stuff from the fourth season you will have to wait a few years. I think these little dvds are a nice value and you will probably watch it more then enough times before the next season comes out. My recommendation is to get this only if you are a big fan of the show other wise you can probably wait till the seasons come out.,1363737600,,685,3.935251798561151
5373995,1,B009Z5BPWS,"WARNING!!!

There is only ONE Fiona and Cake episode on the entire DVD!  The title is misleading!  The rest of the episodes are not about Fiona and Cake.  The ads are misleading as is the title and the cover of the DVD.",1363478400,5,219,4.142857142857143
5373996,3,B009Z5BPWS,"I didn't get this product from Amazon, but figured I'd leave a review for the product itself; I am happy to have it because I love Adventure Time, but I was hoping for it to actually be more related to the episodes involving Fionna and Cake. I'll still enjoy watching it, but it seems like an improper title and art for this collection when not even a handful of episodes relate to them, and therefore seems to be false advertising.

As to the entire Adventure Time DVD collection, I believe it was a strange move on Cartoon Network's part to release the episodes in such a random method as they did, though I'm glad that they have released a season 1 DVD and will be releasing a complete season 2 as well in a few months. I will be sure to spend my money on those instead of these scattered episode collections.",1363305600,,812,4.342105263157895

BOOO :C I still love the show and am keeping it.",1362614400,2,333,4.138461538461539
5374001,3,B009Z5BPWS,"My daughter was disappointed as she thought this would have multiple Fionna & Cake episodes, but there's only ONE EPISODE on this DVD featuring these characters, just FYI.  She still likes it, but parents need to understand this is not a DVD of all Fionna & Cake episodes.  =)",1362182400,49,276,4.612244897959184
5374002,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I understand that this is a kid's cartoon, but the Adventure Time series is a guilty pleasure of mine because many of the episodes convey an adventuresome and happy vibe.  This show provides a refreshing change of positive programming.  I own some of the other Adventure Time collections and preferred to check out ""Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake"" out of curiosity on how many Fiona themed episodes are included in the dvd.  The good thing about this dvd is that there are sixteen quality episodes compiled along with the special feature of ""Little Did You Know."" My only issue with this dvd is that there was only one ""Fionna and Cake"" themed episode instead of at least 2-4 out of the 16 selected episodes. Additionally, this dvd is more for those who really enjoy this cartoon series due to the fact that it is not a full season collection dvd.  Aside from these caveats, ""Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake"" is a great selection for those who like to watch cheerful shows.",1362096000,,974,4.678362573099415
5374003,4,B009Z5BPWS,"You know what ?  This series is so gangbusters (like the comings and goings of a certain pineapple-dwelling poriferan), I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.  ""Adventure Time's"" fourth volume has 16 more new-to-DVD episodes including:

""Fionna and Cake"" - Do not adjust your TV set.  You are now traveling to the land of Aaa and are about to take part in an adventure with Cake the Cat and Fionna the Human Girl as they keep Prince Gumball safe from the insidious Ice Queen.  (Hard to imagine this is all fabricated by the Ice King himself.)
""Storytelling"" - Jake the Dog is feeling ill and asks Finn the Human Boy to go out and have an adventure so that Finn has a story to tell his friend.  And it's not that simple either.
""Still"" - Ice King has put Finn and Jake in a frozen state, and the only way to get the two moving again is to make friends with the Ice King.  Fat chance.
""What Was Missing"" - A Door Lord steals personal possessions from Finn, Jake, BMO, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline.  They must perform a song in order to get their stuff back.
""From Bad to Worse"" - Candy zombies are running amok and the Princess has become one herself !  It's up to Finn, Jake, and friends to find a remedy.
""Marceline's Closet"" - Finn and Jake hide in Marceline's house and spy on her.  Now how are they gonna get out ?
""Ghost Princess"" - The Ghost Princess seeks help from our daring duo as they search for the person responsible for killing her.
""Princess Cookie"" - Our heroes are embroiled in a hostage situation by a crazed cookie.
""You Made Me"" - The Earl of Lemongrab is being a bigger nuisance than before.  Finn and Jake must head to the Outer Realm to solve this problem.
""Lady and Peebles"" - Princess and Rainicorn go out on their own adventure as they search for Finn and Jake in the Ice Kingdom unaware that they're suddenly up against a familiar foe.

Like previous volumes, there's another ""Little Did You Know"" featurette, which has more bios on certain characters.

So there goes another somewhat unnecessary release of the hit Cartoon Network series, and to those of you still griping, there's hope yet.  The full second season set is premiering before you know it !  Until then, look for more brand new episodes on TV and new issues of ""Adventure Time"" comic books from kaboom! which includes a special Fionna and Cake spin-off !  Now that's algebraic.",1362009600,2,2372,4.481395348837209
5374004,5,B009Z5BPWS,Great scattered episode collection. Our family really loves Adventure Time so all of these DVD's are a must have in our house!,1362009600,,126,4.7727272727272725
5374005,5,B009Z5BPWS,"My daughters, ages 13 & 11,  are hooked on Adventure Time, which I really don't know too much about because I usually don't watch it with them. When my daughter saw this she wanted it as soon as it came out because apparantly they don't show Fionna & Cake with Finn & Jake. From what I gather they are from two different worlds so the Fionna & Cake episodes do not play all the time and only Fionna & Cake only appear in their own episodes. When I bought the dvd I thought it was going to be all Fionna & Cake episodes and didn't realize til afterwards that I think there are only 2 fionna & cake episodes 1. Fionna & Cake, #8. What Was Missing. There is also a special feature titled ""Little Did You Know"" which unfortunately I can't say what is about because it is a gift that my daughter is getting for Easter. I wouldn't go by the some of the terrible ratings of disgruntled viewers who want the full season on dvd. From a kids point of view I think they will love it. It has episodes from season's 2, 3 & 4.
Episodes:
1 Fionna and Cake
2 Storytelling
3 The Other Tarts
4The Silent King
5 Death In Bloom
6 Still
7 Wizard
8 What Was Missing
9 From Bad To Worse
10 Marceline's Closet
11 Ghost Princess
12 Incendium
13 Card Wars
14 Princess Cookie
15 You Made Me
16 Lady & Peebles
Plus special feature ""Little Did You Know""

So for under $12 I wouldn't be complaining. If they don't have full seasons out yet at least this has from seasons 2, 3 & 4. So all in all I think a good buy for Adventure Time fans.",1361750400,4,1508,4.057046979865772
5374006,1,B009Z5BPWS,"I would like to express my disappointment in Cartoon Networks/Dreamworks insatiable greed. I love certain programs like Adventure Time. However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD. I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN/DW is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs. You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap. So many customers demand full seasons ONLY! You may fool the average consumer, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN/DW's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed. What ever happened to producing quality products? What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal? The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD. I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics. My voice will be heard, if not by CN/DW, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks. America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed. You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK/DREAMWORKS!",1361664000,4,1764,4.5266457680250785
5374007,5,B009Z5BPWS,"Being a big Adventure Time fan family, we buy almost everything Adventure Time related that comes out, so this release was no exception. As with previous ""vanilla"" releases, you're getting DVD-quality versions of the episodes, and they're a mixture of Season Three with a bit of Season Four, and overall they're a good choice of episodes.

If you're looking for something more canonical, then definitely wait for the (assumed) Adventure Time Season Two Complete, which will not only have all the episodes in order from that season, but also the excellent commentary and extras that really add to the enjoyment of the episodes.",1361491200,3,626,5.077669902912621
5374008,5,B009Z5BPWS,"This DVD was awesome only because my son loves Adventure Time and he said it was awesome. I did not have any problems with it. And the other reviews say that they didn't like it because it wasn't the full season. It specificly says on the cover ""Fionna and Cake... includes 16 episodes of Finn and Jake."" It says nothing about the whole season.",1361404800,5,344,4.390625

I've bought the Season 1 DVDs but I refuse to support this random sampling nonsense.
The show is up to season 5 now and season 2 isn't even expected to be released until June 4 2013.
Get some marketing sense, Cartoon Network. You've got some catching up to do.
I've pre-ordered the Season 1 and Season 2 Blu-Rays. They're available for pre-order here on Amazon.
We don't want your random assortment of episodes.
We want full, unadulterated seasons.

It is ripping people off. And it is obviously not what the fans want if you look at the other one star ratings. People want to buy the complete seasons!",1360627200,8,367,4.492537313432836
5374012,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I actually really enjoy these collections... they're inexpensive and, in my opinion, have the best of the best episodes. I think people tend to forget that the majority of Adventure Time episodes aren't chronological to begin with, so for me at least, having the actual seasons isn't a big deal to me. What I really like about these collections, though, is that while they may seem ""random"", they are really faithful to every AT arc that actually does have a coherent storyline. I currently own My Two Favorite People and Jake VS Me-mow - on both DVDs, the Lich arc is in perfect order. Jake VS Me-mow even has Mortal Folly, Mortal Recoil, and Too Young, one right after the other. Pretty smart if you ask me. I'll definitely be buying this DVD - it has some of my favorite episodes and 11.99 for 16 episodes is a pretty sweet deal...",1360108800,4,834,4.529801324503311
5374013,5,B009Z5BPWS,"I think it's a little dumb people are seriously rating the collections 1 star and whining that not every season is on DVD. If you follow Pendleton Ward on Twitter you'll know a Season 2 DVD is in the works as he tweets updates about it from time to time, and using common sense, you'd know the rest of the seasons will follow suit.

Yes, this is another episode collection DVD, but that's an extremely poor reason to rate this product so low. If this not being a full season DVD bothers you even though the rest of the seasons ARE coming, you should probably go rate the Adventure Time belts, action figures, plushes, keychains, shirts, hats, posters, books, wallets, video game, and whatever else you can find 1 star because they're also not full season DVD's.

The products you want are in production and the rest inevitably will come (or are ALREADY available in other formats) and you're rating separate products lowly because they're not the other stuff that's definitely on the way. Doesn't make a bit of sense.

EDIT 2/26/13: Well looky here! I just saw, right here on Amazon, that Adventure Time Season 2 is coming! June 4th! Just like I said. Now quit whining that this separate product isn't a full season. The stuff you actually want, and more, are definitely coming.",1359763200,6,1278,4.646017699115045
5374014,1,B009Z5BPWS,Release the seasons! instead of buying the compilation dvds i am definitely going to wait till march when all the episodes are supposedly appearing on Netflix Streaming.

5374015,1,B009Z5BPWS,"Adventure Time is such a great show for children and adults, much like the early episodes of Spongebob. Adventure Time deserves the same DVD treatment that Spongebob has. At least 7 of Spongebob's seasons are out on DVD, so there is no reason why you can't put together full seasons of Adventure Time on two discs and sell it to the public",1359417600,2,339,4.483870967741935

5374018,5,B009Z5BPWS,How about you manchildren suck it up and be glad CN allows the release of any DVDs at all. Do you really truly like the show?

And personally, I like these random, creator selected things.
I find them fun.
If you don't want it, don't buy it.
Not hard.
I find the random selections to be cheaper, which is a plus, and even though I LIKE to watch the episodes in order, that's only THE FIRST TIME THROUGH.
After that, I get a pretty good idea on whats what, and I just like to browse, and poke around at my favorites.
So, if you don't appreciate that, don't buy them. :)",1358812800,4,533,4.235294117647059
5374020,1,B009Z5BPWS,"Cartoon network needs to stop jerking their fans around with these randomly compiled dvd collections. They allow their Adult Swim series to have full season dvd releases, I don't see why the shows aimed at the younger crowd should be any different. All of ""Foster's Home"" was never released (as far as I know) and now you can't find anything beyond season 1 on DVD (for less than $50 if you can even find it). It is a true disservice to the fans of the show that want hard copies of theses shows to keep for future viewing or to share with future generations. I have a son due to be born in March and I have several of my favorite shows from growing up and current favorites on hard for when he gets old enough to share them with him.

I hate 1-staring Adventure Time - but all of these collections will be receiving this rating. I think you can tell the mood of your audience by looking at the 1 & 2 star reviews for this collection.

Instant video doesn't count either - I want the disc.",1357516800,26,989,4.227513227513228
5374021,1,B009Z5BPWS,I love the show but choosing to hand out random collections over full seasons is a jerk move on their part. At this rate we will probably see bootleg compilations of all the seasons do date before seeing an official season 2 release. Maybe the powers in charge of marketing and releases have a marble rattling in their skull for brains. Or maybe they just want to push people to go digital. Making some money off on-demand before investing in production and shelf space. Who knows but it sucks all the same to only have the option of scraps or digital.,1357344000,30,552,4.475247524752476
5374022,1,B009Z5BPWS,"Honestly, this is ridiculous. Cartoon Network knows that Adventure Time has a significant viewer base of people over the age of 13. All of those people who like the show enough to actually buy it, are smart enough to want full seasons. What makes it even worse is that they are not even in order, why would anyone want these when they know that eventually cartoon network will release seasons? This is just a cheap way to punish fans for wanting there favorite episodes ahead of time, only to have to buy them again when the full season releases come out.",1357344000,18,555,4.5049504950495045
