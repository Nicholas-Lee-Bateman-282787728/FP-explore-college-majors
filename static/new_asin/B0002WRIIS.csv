8033680,1,B0002WRIIS,This film is disgusting and dumb.  I really enjoyed the original twilight zone TV show but not this tape.  I only enjoyed the scene with Vincent Price as a mad college professor whose students turned out to be robots.,1375056000,,217,4.538461538461538
8033681,3,B0002WRIIS,"""Class of '99"" features Vincent Price and Brandon de Wilde in a story of a futuristic (at least, in terms of 1971 audiences) college wherein the final exam reveals the ""readiness"" of potential graduates to embark in society with all its wills and ills.  Price is effectively authoritarian as the professor that determines who is ready to leave the institution.

""I'll Never Leave You - Ever"", with Lois Nettleton, John Saxon, and character actor Royal Dano, stands as one of the series most memorable horror stories.  Nettleton's ""cheating wife"" gets the appropriate justice for her machinations.

""A Death in the Family"" with E.G. Marshall and Desi Arnaz, Jr., as well as ""There Aren't Any More MacBanes,"" are mild and rather tepid in comparison to the aforemetioned pair.

The other installments are short and amusing, especially the rather kinky ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" staring Victor Buono.",1105488000,2,896,5.2377622377622375
