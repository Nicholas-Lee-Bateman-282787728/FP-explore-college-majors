8231225,3,B000Y8AEEK,"Disclaimer: I've only worked through one song thus far, US Blues. Nate's instructions were helpful in getting the core of the solo, but there were a number of parts that he didn't teach (although he played them during the demo section). I worked with the video, as well as with the original Grateful Dead recording he was using, and I had to figure out certain passages myself. I'd expect a video such as this to be 100% accurate. If I can figure out the correct solo, note for note, then whoever is getting paid to make this video can do the same.",1399852800,2,548,4.382352941176471
8231226,3,B000Y8AEEK,"I found this video to be hard to use. Nate breaks the song into sections which is a good way to learn. It would have been nice if there was a way to repeat a section or go back to a mark other than the beggining of the song. Some accompanying tab would have doubled the value and made it much easier to follow. I think this would be most useful to someone who could already play the song but wanted to add some authenticity to the presentation. I expected to spend hours with this video learning these songs, but I haven't gone back after the first viewing. I will some day!",1330732800,3,574,4.133928571428571
8231227,5,B000Y8AEEK,"Nate clearly knows his stuff!  His teaching style is easy going, and he certainly has the talent and enthusiasm.  This video assumes you are comfortable with barre chords and know the notes on the fretboard.  Nate moves pretty quickly through some licks, but hey, its a video!  If you miss something, you can watch it again (and again!).  As someone mentioned, it would be really nice to have tablature to accompany the video.",1323388800,4,426,4.780821917808219
8231228,5,B000Y8AEEK,"Nate LaPointe is a great player and instructor.  He has an easy going style and clearly walks you though each step on how to play these songs.

One of the best things about the Grateful Dead is the dual structures to the songs they play.  Nate shows exactly how Jerry played his portions as well as Bobby's side.  He also has a background track so you can clearly hear how the two segments blend together,

Bottom line is that if you like the Dead and want to know how to play each song correctly, then this DVD is an excellent resource.  Hopefully you will have a good friend who is also willing to sit through each song so that you have someone to play with!",1254096000,9,660,4.24
8231229,5,B000Y8AEEK,This video is great for learning to play Grateful Dead songs. I especially love it because it goes over various styles from different periods. It uses concert footage and live music to teach. I was worried that it would be all album versions but I am glad to know that there is some style in the video too. If you want to learn to play this is perfect. I wish it came with a tab book though.,1225929600,6,391,4.090909090909091
