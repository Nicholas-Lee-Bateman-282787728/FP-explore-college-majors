8295529,5,B001ARYYX6,"This review is for the triple jump portion only, although I did watch the pole vault portion as well and the technique and drills that are taught look very useful. Both of my kids triple jump, one in high school the other at a small college.  I've coached track, but only at the middle school level.  I have researched the triple jump a lot over the years, so I feel like I know quite a bit about the event. Anyway, I decided to purchase this video, and it turned out to be a great decision.  My boys and I learned a lot of new things with each phase of the jump, plus drills and conditioning.  The dvd is a little dated, but all the information is very useful. It is presented by the triple jump coach at U of Oregon. If you want to become a better coach or participant in this event, I would highly recommend this video. If you want to become a better triple jumper, buy this video otherwise keep shopping.  You can find a portion of this video on Youtube.",1262995200,,958,4.184782608695652
