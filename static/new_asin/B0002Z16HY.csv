2151007,5,B0002Z16HY,"I saw the film tonight in a local cinema. Incidentally and not quite surprisingly, there are only 2 cinemas showing that film in Hong Kong. I was quite disturbed by those scenes depicting the horror of war and the sufferings of the German civilians, and I was so shocked by the scene which showed the poisoning of the 6 children of Josef Goebbels by his wife that I was left stunned for quite a while. Another great aspect of the film is the historical accuracy of the German uniforms and weapons used in the film. It is a true masterpiece for anyone interested in German military history in WWII.",1111276800,6,597,4.486238532110092
2151008,5,B0002Z16HY,"I think it is illuminating to at least try and think of this movie outside of the context of fall of Naziism and Hitler. It becomes an excellent study of the human reactions to the situation that is presented. The reactions are varied and realistic, showing the cowardice, the nobility, the psychotic delusions of others as their all-powerful leader slides into paranoia and delusions.

However, the movie can not be divorced from it's placing, and the fact that the movie is set in Hitler's bunker as Berlin falls around him adds an additional level of complexity to the movie. One is horrified to discover in one's self a sense of sympathy for the humans presented but at the same time, they were a bunch of humans in an extrordinary situation. Their reactions, as presented, have the mark of truth.

The scenes in war torn Berlin are notable in that they show the hideous brutality of the war without exploding heads and other gratutious violence. The depiction of children manning the anti-aircraft guns was apparently accurate and to me clearly depicted the German desperation towards the end of the war.

The difficulty associated with this movie comes from the realization that these were rather ordinary folks, just like you and me, who got swept away by something much bigger and much more horrific than any of them apparently imagined. It's not ""sympathy"" for the Nazis, but a suggestion a little scarier: it could happen anywhere.",1111190400,10,1441,4.897540983606557
2151009,5,B0002Z16HY,"The actor behind Hitler is incredible, so believable! One of the greatest ""War""-movies ever made, and the fact that it is german only makes it more interesting.

I had seen interviews with the old lady (I have forgotten her name) who worked as Hitlers' ""desk-girl"", and recognized a lot of what happened in the movie from what she told the interviewer. The story and filming is so realistic, and the fact that most of the events taking place in Der Untergang really happened, well, it takes your breath away.

It's fantastic, frightening while it gives a documentary-feel. A movie everyone should see...",1110672000,8,603,4.901960784313726
2151010,5,B0002Z16HY,"I just saw this amazing film and was left in a state of complete shock.  I've seen many films about Hitler, the Holocaust and the Nazi movement, but none quite as powerful and convincing as this.  It humanized Hitler and the Nazis in a way that gave method to their madness, not in the form of justification or sympathy, but more in terms of explaining the blind attachment of these madmen to their maniacal beliefs and rabid hatred.  What's most distressing about this story is its metaphorical application to much of what's happening in the world today, particularly in the United States where many American people desperately believe in the lies and deceptions of George Bush (like the Germans desperately believed in their leader), a man who casts a sanctimonious net over his misguided beliefs by hiding behind fundamentalist Christianity; and a man whose arrogantly imperial actions are disrupting the world in ways similar to those of Adolph Hitler.  It leaves me believing more than ever that humanity does not learn from historical missteps like those of the Nazis, it simply repeats them with the same degree of demagoguery and nationalistic gusto.  Very sad, but true.",1110585600,21,1179,4.994897959183674
2151011,5,B0002Z16HY,"I am a german woman. After I saw this movie I felt terrible. It is hardly to believe what happened once. This movie shows the last days of Adolf Hitler. There exist many movies about Hitler, but this one is something special, because the actors and actresses are more than convincing. The movie shows a Hitler who also has a human side. Many people, also me, are sceptical about this, but first this fact gives the movie something special.

You can not only see the last days of this brutal man, also of the doctor Goebbel and his family.

This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen and in my opinion the best movie which was ever made by germans...",1109894400,26,660,4.314516129032258
2151012,5,B0002Z16HY,"Within the orbit of the ""sturm und drang' universe that was the twelve year reign of the Third Reich, almost nothing was excessive, not even the maniacal gesticulations of the Little Corporal, Adolph Hitler, whose final days in the enveloping holocaust that was Berlin in April of 1945. In ""Downfall"" we are treated to a disagreeable dollop of desperately demented degenerates in an absolutely riveting look at just how fantastic and solipsistic the worldview of the Nazis was. Even as the Gotterdammerung explodes around them, Hitler fancies a meal of Cheese ravioli even as his eating companions dither.

Hitler was nothing if not megalomaniacal; yet there was method to his madness, for the Soviet Union was indeed literally moving heaven and earth to discover and destroy him. Yet his almost whimsical last-ditch efforts to resurrect the smashed Wehrmacht to rescue him and win the day are fascinating to see recreated so powerfully and sometimes poetically here, and it helps one to better understand the malignant and molevolent motive force behind the mass movement that left mega-millions of dead and even more ruined lives in its fateful wake.

The movie strikes a fascinating counterpoint between the social dramas of the siege of Berlin around with the more personal drama of what is happening within the bunker itself. In so doing, it breathes life into Hannah Arendt's fascinating comment about the ultimate banality of evil. After all, these were human beings struggling to survive within the concrete confines of the bunker, however tortured, conflicted and self-interested. To recognize this is to better comprehend just how petty and mundane their lives were in these most fatal final hous of their miserable existence, worrying as they did about making coffee and smoking cigarettes while their very world was being smashed into smithereens above them.

The movie is multi-layered and quite sophisticated, and pointedly makes no effort to reach for the lowest common denominator in judging Hitler and his entourage, offering no drive-by facile answers while painfully and graphically exploring the excruciatingly caustic world of the Third Reich in its last painful death throes. Instead, we are reminded that the Fuhrer was as much a social phenomenon as he was an individual, and it was as much the fault of the average German who followed his charismatic lead as the devil himself who created the circumstance for the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. This may not be a movie you will really enjoy, but it is one we can all profit from seeing!",1109808000,24,2568,5.124105011933175

It shows him as he was, even sometimes kind and charming, which is all the more revolting knowing what a twisted monster he was. Even more disturbing is the actual video of a real-life interview with Traudl Junge, his personal secretary, who claimed ignorance of what happened and made a feeble attempt to show remorse to perhaps appease her interviewer, but it is apparent she felt little responsibility.",1523145600,,537,5.033707865168539

When I heard this movie was on Prime,I had to watch it again for myself. If you are at all interested in history (and you should be), this film is required viewing. In no other film have I seen the power that Hitler apparently held over seemingly rational people depicted so convincingly. Also, the level of attention devoted to the sets and costumes is amazing. The uniforms, weapons, buildings, all authentic. You feel as if you are there in wartime Germany. Ironically, many of the street scenes were filmed in St. Petersburg, Russia. The acting is on a level rarely seen anywhere. Bruno Ganz makes you forget that you are watching an actor and simply puts Hitler before you as a believable person rather than as a caricature or stereotype. The supporting cast is equally impressive. See this film. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made about World War II.",1523059200,,1033,4.559139784946237

2151032,5,B0002Z16HY,"""When I am laid in earth, Remember me, but ah, Forget my fate.""  -- Purcell - Dido And Aeneas

This was the background music through much of the movie. Purcell. Not Bach. Not Wagner. Otherwise some Lehar or other operetta music.

This is an overwhelming movie. Unlike so many historical or WW2 movies it does not feel anachronistic. The generation that lived through this time is all gone now. And the one that followed immediately afterwards (mine) is on its way out. I can say this is as close to ""real"" as we are likely to see in popular format.",1521763200,,548,4.46

You can't take your eyes off him once he's in a scene. He commands everyone around him and no one wants to question him.  They want so much to believe in him it's heartbreaking.

2151041,5,B0002Z16HY,"Bruno Ganz gives one of the most brilliant film performances ever as Adolf Hitler in this extremely well-done historical drama detailing Hitler's last 10 days on earth hiding in his Berlin bunker as the Russians surround and bombard the city. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel does an excellent job of recreating the feeling of claustrophobia and fear inside the small underground surroundings as Hitler's world shrinks smaller and smaller and the noose around his neck gets tighter and tighter. The supporting cast is also great in their respective roles, most especially Juliane Khler as Eva Braun, Thomas Kretschmann as Braun's ill-fated brother-in-law, Fegelein, and Corinna Harfouch, giving a bone-chilling performance as Frau Magda Goebbels, a woman who can't imagine either herself nor her children living in a world without National Socialism.",1519689600,,846,5.565891472868217

2151067,5,B0002Z16HY,"In the closing days of Hitler's Third Reich, Germans defend the Fatherland to their last breath. Others engage in wild parties. Shell-shocked citizens caught in war's merciless path try to survive. And woven into the story line is heroism by everyday people, such as the doctor who operates on the wounded, and young girls who volunteer as nurses in the bomb shelter.

A stunning example of heroism is the Hitler Youth and their cultist devotion to the Nazi state. In this cauldron of total youth indoctrination we are presented with a complex scene of reality and fantasy.

The reality is fourteen year-old Inge, who states that she will fight to the very last man with her Hitler Youth group (see picture).

The shocking fantasy is Hitler's new wife, Eva Braun, who is deep underground in the bunker. As Eva writes a letter to her sister, she is immune to Inge's perilous situation on the streets above. Her immediate concern is a necklace, watch, and chocolates, and who will receive them when Germany falls.

As we hear the words of Eva's letter, we are back on the streets of Berlin with Inge. Out of ammunition and faced with death or survival, her Hitler Youth companions scatter like cockroaches as the Russians inch closer. Inge, however, doesn't cower or leave. Her group leader hands over a pistol and orders her to commit suicide rather than risk capture...but Inge hands it back. She stands erect and steadfast in a fanatical Heil Hitler salute as the group leader shoots her...then, staggering about In total shock, the group leader takes his own life.

During this scene -- and in complete silence -- the Berlin streets are in chaos and explosive hell-fire. Only the words of Eva Braun's letter and solemn background music immerse us in a surrealistic world. Although It may feel eerie, it is historically accurate.

At this point I had to pause the film because I was completely shocked by the chasm that separated the lives of Inge and Eva: one gave her mortal life for the Fatherland; the other bequeathed worldly comforts at a point when they were useless.

The film director admits that Hitler is a shell of a man, completely empty and without content. A man with outbursts of rage, issuing orders to armies that can't save him. This is apparent when Eva Braun confesses that she has known Hitler for fifteen years but knows nothing about him. She also admits to hating his dog, Blondi, and kicks it when he is not there.

The director's narration of the film is excellent. Although it may be dry in parts, you will learn volumes about the making of the film, experience deeper insight into the characters by their own words, and uncover historical facts unknown to most of us.

Downfall is a remarkable treasure for future generations. The ultimate question is whether or not we teach our children to learn from history.

Since, I long ago left a review on the movie, however, this review is about the quality of the Blu-Ray.  Just imagine, for a moment, my joy at seeing one of my favorite movies made into Blu-Ray.  No more standard DVD for me.  I could get the sharpest, clearest picture and awesome sound ever.  How could that be a bad thing?  Well, it is if that's what you are expecting.  This latest iteration is not like any Blu-Ray I've ever seen.  As a matter of fact I can't tell the difference between it and the standard DVD.  The picture is slightly grainy, and the sound is mediocre.  If you're a veteran ""Downfall"" watcher and are excited to watch it, finally, in Blu-Ray, you will be disappointed.  Don't waste your money.  I actually put both DVD's side by side, watching one with my brand new Blu-Ray while watching the other, old and worn standard definition DVD.  You can't tell the difference.  Period.  There's ZERO difference between the two.  Someone is marketing this as Blu-Ray to make a fast buck and I've no doubt they are making it, on the backs of those of us who ordered it, expecting superior quality only to receive a mediocre product.

The actor who plays Hitler's is a little too chubby but asides from that he nails it. If your into subtitles and a war drama you'll definitely enjoy this one. I give it a 8 outta 10.

With regard to the quality of the product itself, the Blu-ray version is terrible.  The video quality is very poor, with more graininess than the copy I downloaded from YouTube.  I did run it on several players; Panasonic, Samsung and LG.  The results were the same on all three.
To be fair, there are selected scenes that Momentum pictures did upgrade to Blu-ray quality, but they are outnumbered by the substandard video quality.
Maybe it's a copy instead of an original, but it certainly does not rate as Blu-ray quality.  I believe the standard DVD version would be more consistent.

The downfall of a psychopathic delusional dictator, rapacious sycophants, an odious regime and the innocents caught in the trap of inevitability. But tragedy is also the coincidence and the falling together of human judgments and actions within the conjunction of circumstances. The tragic collusion of human hubris with fate. This is a plot wherein action unfolds in a deterministic falling together of decisions, actions and events. This is a plot wherein action unfolds before us according to what seemingly appear to be laws of causal necessity though the actions in question remain contingent.  This tragedy of downfall produces a sense of forbidding inevitability that informs the grim progress of the movie and creates an overall mood of calamity. The sense of tragic inevitability depicted in the movie is palatable and is the most important and distinguishing aspect of this movie.",1490313600,2,946,5.264900662251655

I have seen a lot of movies and none of them come close to the man we see in the black and white films, until this film. Spending the last ten days of Adolf Hitler's life in the bunker, surrounding by many of his Nazis is seen primarily through the eyes of his personal secretary, a 22 year young Traudl Junge. Most horrifying is the way that Mrs. Goebel's kills all six of her own children. Though we are watching the greatest monsters of the century, the film draws our sympathy for the very ordinary human beings who were consumed by absolute power with their completely warped ideology. This is by far one of the most engaging movies I've ever seen, historical and otherwise and it's precisely because it is in German that it works so well. The casting of this film is spot on, making each character believable, especially Bruno Ganz and his interpretation of Adolf Hitler which I feel is worthy of an Oscar.

At times I caught myself actually sympathizing with some of the characters as the acting in this was beyond brilliant.

Given ""Downfall"" is all in German and so well-acted it seems like it was shot ""live"" in those actual days. Its subtitled of course but you adjust quickly and it doesn't distract from the move in any way. Many of the actors bare striking resemblances to the real characters. I have read many reviews that complain this movie humanizes Hitler more but I don't really agree. I think it shows him for what he was and in no way makes him a sympathetic character.

2151182,5,B0002Z16HY,"Excellent film, but some characters were not as lovely as they are portrayed here.

Four Nazis are portrayed relatively favourably - Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, Nazi architect Albert Speer, SS doctor Schenck, and SS commander Mohnke. Three of them wrote autobiographies - this seems to have been a successful strategy.

The myth that Albert Speer was a 'good Nazi' should be buried once and for all. Historians have uncovered documents that show he was lying when he claimed he did not know about Nazi atrocities. He personally profited from the persecution of Jews, acquiring property and paintings that once belonged to Jews. That is outside the scope of this film, but the point is that he was a liar.

There are certain scenes that could only have come from one person's memoirs - that does not make them true, especially when there are no known or surviving witnesses to corroborate it. And even if these people cared for their fellow Germans, that does not mean they cared a fig for the Nazis' victims.

I am sceptical about former Nazi supporters who claim they ""did not know"" - they are playing with words. They might not have known about the scale of the killing, but they knew the Jews were being maltreated, and they supported it.

On the whole - a great film with great acting.",1454630400,,1294,4.733333333333333

Now that I've just finished watching this movie, I really think it does a good job of immersing one into the world of just intense insanity that must have been the bunker atmosphere - especially as the end approached in 1945.

I think the focus on the suicides and the various reasons why (all some form of fanatic devotion and dedication to a madman and his twisted vision) that are depicted in this film really help one see just what an evil and polluted mindset was present in Germany's leadership from 1933 - 1945.",1443312000,2,626,4.396551724137931

What I mean is, the subtitles are done very well, the credits are in English and overall, you get the feeling that it's not necessarily a foreign film, but more an American made film keeping to the authenticity of being spoken in German. The cinematography is amazing (especially on Blu-Ray) and almost instantly you feel like you've been transported thru time back to 1945 war-torn Berlin. The movie is well paced, well acted and keeps to facts rather suggesting opinions on what kind of man Hitler was. With all the God-awful things he did during his dictatorship, he was a human being and certainly known to be kind to those he was fond of. Anyway, my point is, it was interesting to see another side of the man different from what you're used to in his fiery speeches or personality in Inglorious Basterds. WATCH. THIS.

2151238,5,B0002Z16HY,"Bruno Ganz is such a superior actor, and this is maybe one of his best performances along with Wings Of Desire. It's hard to say 'finest', as it is Adolf Hitler, and based on a lot of speculation and here say. But, I think Bruno puts his all into it, and delivers such a humane portrait of one of histories greatest monsters. Had Hitler's last ditch maneuvers prove victorious, he may have led Germany on to great heights of prosperity and decadence. Or, he may have become the paranoid zealot and order every German to stand guard at the border to protect his ruined empire? Either way, we see a leader at the brink. The moment of truth. The denial of remorse, and the seething hatred for collective and personal failure. And though 99.9% of the world to this day view Hitler as a twisted, cruel, megalomaniac - he was still just a mere man who had dreams. And I think the movie shows that ANY leader of ANY country could easily look like Adolf in the bunker being surrounded by the enemy. How could something so right and powerful become so defeated and judged? Hard to imagine America, England, China, or Russia ever being put into that corner - and lose. But if it could happen to Hitler, it could happen to anyone still to this day. And oh, the truth we would learn thereafter. Exceptional movie with an exceptional cast portraying the exceptional ending of a leader who loved to hate, Yet may have not hated to love.

2151240,5,B0002Z16HY,"According to the events of the film, which I assume are mostly accurate with some liberal aspects for cinematic effect, the ideology of the Nazi regime took much longer and was far more difficult to crumble than the buildings, infrastructure and military operations of the Third Reich. This film not only takes the viewer inside the bunker where Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in late April, 1945, it takes us inside the heads of the most loyal Nazis. And what we learn about these people is as terrifying in many ways as what the Nazis did to millions of people across Europe outside the confines of Hitler's final residence.

The structure begins and ends with an interview as cinematic bookends. A real-life survivor of the Reich who had been one of Hitler's private secretaries during the final years of the Third Reich, Traudl Junge, appears on screen. Now an old woman, she describes how she was enthralled to receive the opportunity to become a member of Hitler's inner circle. At the end, she alludes to the fact she didn't think for herself.

The narrative scenes begin in 1942 with Traudl Junge among a group of aspiring young women wishing to work for Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz), dictator and self-proclaimed savior of Germany. Not surprising, Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is chosen for the job by the Fhrer himself. Then the film cuts to April 20, 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday. It's inevitable to everyone involved that not only is Germany going to lose the war against the allies, but Berlin is only days away from being taken by the Russian Army. Hitler's inner circle, including Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels, insist that it's time for him, Eva Braun, and the rest of his inner circle to evacuate Berlin. Hitler refuses, claiming it would be a sign of cowardice and surrender. Before going underground, he awards Iron Crosses to members of ""Hitler's Youth"". Then he moves his operation into an underground bunker where he and his closest associates will try to keep the Reich together during its final days.

The events which transpire in this film are some of the most disturbing and devastating as any film about World War II and the Reich I've ever seen. While all the residents of the bunker, save the children of Goebbels, know the war and the Reich are coming to an anti-climactic but tragic end, they cling to their ideology like moths in front of a lighted bug zapper. They must have known in their heart-of-hearts that this was not going to end in their favor. However, they can't imagine life without the Reich and their Fhrer. He had become the acknowledged decision-maker, philosopher, and thinker for the entire country. In several scenes, the people around him acknowledge over and over again that only Hitler can make the decisions, no one else. And if they question him, or, God forbid, refuse his orders, they are labeled traitors, even in the face of impending destruction.

Barely a week and a half before Hitler and Eva Braun will commit suicide, Hitler is still barking orders, arresting wayward soldiers, and sentencing perceived traitorous officers and AWOL soldiers to death, as if he is still in charge of his country, even though the allies have by now taken most of Germany, and the Russians are on the outskirts of Berlin, a few kilometers away. He rants and raves to the highest officers in his command, chastising them for not winning the war. He instructs his officers to mobilize army units in other parts of the country, even though they have all been defeated by the allies. He continues with his maps and strategies, like a chess player contemplating his next move, even though his king has been surrounded and near checkmate. However, surrender is beyond him, even at the price of more killing and destruction. The real eye-opener is not that Hitler wouldn't let go of his ideology, but those around him couldn't bring themselves to stop following his orders.

In his final days and hours, according the film, Hitler never wavered from his ultimate ideology, even though the ideology itself is what led to the final demise of the Reich. His ideology for Germany was relatively simple: a national socialist government in which Hitler himself is absolute ruler without question or pause, and ethnic minorities, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies have no place and must be swept aside. These ideas proved immoral and ruinous.

It's not surprising that Hitler failed to see his ideology not only meant the destruction of Europe and the deaths and suffering of millions, but it also meant the near destruction of Germany itself. What is surprising is that those around him couldn't see passed Hitler's madness. During many scenes, high-ranking members of his inner circle could have refused his orders to save the German people, but they did not. They were so hypnotized by his rhetoric and ideology they had no concept to believe they could make decisions to save Germany and deny the Fhrer his power. Most follow him to the very end, and the price some of them pay for this loyalty is almost unimaginable. Goebbels's wife in a moving scene breaks down because she can't bear the thought of the country being without its socialist ideology and dictator.

The tragedy of Germany and those most loyal to him and the Nazi cause was a blind refusal to see how their ideology was self-destructive rather than life-affirming. They believed in one leader who would do all the thinking for them and therefore they couldn't and shouldn't think for themselves. Such a tragedy that that leader happened to be Adolph Hitler. At one point, Goebbels says he has no sympathy for the country, since it was the country itself which allowed these madmen into power in the first place.",1431043200,5,5738,4.854954034729316

It's important to know that this movie is in the German language with English subtitles. Don't let that stop you from purchasing the film though, it's brilliantly done and the native German gives it a very authentic feel.

Being a history lover and having read many accounts of this particular time period I believe the movie to follow events as historically accurate as possible. Bruno Ganz does a fantastic job of portraying a head of state lunatic who was stubbornly in denial about his eventual defeat until the last week of his life. Many human emotions are well acted out against the backdrop of the inhumane war raging above. Each person inside the bunker has his or her own her own way of dealing with the coming downfall and each has their own way of capitulating defeat. Many will chose suicide as a way out. Other fanatics, especially some younger inexperienced teenagers choose to fight to the death in the streets of Berlin for a war that was by all other measures lost. Others try to escape, some will make it while others don't. The scene showing what Magda Goebbles chose to do at was hard to watch, although it was probably the most realistic depiction of what actually happened.

2151265,5,B0002Z16HY,"Scenes from this movie are the most parodied film on the internet.  Hitler rants and screams to whatever subtitles the people making the parody want to use.  The real film is an excellent movie and a bit disturbing. The story depicts the last 5 days of Hitler's life.  It's disturbing because it's true and the events really happened.  Right up to the end, Hitler had people shot for betraying him.  He gave orders that could not be obeyed and then had the generals shot for not following his orders. Various people end their lives because they don't want to live in a world without Hitler.  That is another disturbing part of the movie to see that some of these people were so devoted to a madman, that they committed suicide rather than live without him leading the country.  I kept asking myself how could people be that blind and stupid The long scene of how Joseph Goebbels and his wife end their own lives is very strange. I knew how he ended his life, but to actually watch it happen was makes it so real.  Bruno Ganz is great at Hitler, one minute he is yelling at the top of his voice and then he talking softly to small children.  The film is well directed and filmed.  The movie a based on the book by Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary.  The movie is bookended with an interview with the real Junge.  This is a must see movie if you want learn of the events of the last five days of Hitler and several other people.  The movie is in German with English subtitles.  I don't like how some movies are dubbed into English, a lot of language is changed and you lose the real meaning of what is being said.  I really enjoyed this film and think it is one of the better films about WWII and Hitler.  The film is not too graphic and when people shoot themselves we see very little, and just hear the shots and then see the aftermath.  The only real exception is how Frau Goebbels murders her children with poison.

When Hitler marries Eva Braun, the scene is almost funny.  The government agent is required by law to ask Hitler to prove is he a pure Aryan and asks to see the cards that show that proof.  When Hitler ends his life, we hear the gunshot , but they never show the body.  If you know history then you know how most of people end up, but seeing how it happens is fascinating.  I highly recommend this movie.",1424736000,4,2321,4.311778290993072

2151275,5,B0002Z16HY,"Cruelty, insanity, racism, hatred, military power. Sound familiar?

This movie is about what war does to people -- to their minds, their personalities and relationships, and yes, it is about blind, fanatical adherence to political dogma, ideology and propaganda, over and above any other considerations for life, friendship, love, or any shred of commonsense. This movie is about death and destruction on an unimaginable scale, except that just in my own lifetime, the events shown here have been repeated again and again, all over the world ad nauseum.

It is a close study of the kinds of rigid, Manichean men and women who are the masterminds, architects and purveyors of destructive, anti-human dogmas, as well as, surprisingly, of the small kindnesses that pass between them in hours of extreme crisis.

With only a little imagination, this film is an analogy about the fall of Baghad, and of Kabul, of Tokyo, and of Hong Kong and Singapore, of Stalingrad, and of Rotterdam, and of course, of Saigon and Phnom Penh. For good reason, it bears a close resemblance to many of the scenes in ""War and Peace"" and to ""Gone with the Wind."" It is about the endless wars still raging in Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East.

As such this is a movie for our times, and about most post-Napoleonic struggles, when an ideology has lured men and women into and in support of war, and kept them there beyond any reasonable expectations of anything good ever coming from it.

Though I have seen a couple other renditions of the specific ""fall of Hitler"" genre, this film seems to have been painstakingly written and directed to show as much historical accuracy as possible. It is excellently acted, and reminiscent of a part of the long German film ""Heimat.""

If you happen to be, as I, a student of the German language oder von der deutschen Sprache, es ist auch ausgezeichnet fuer lernen!",1422403200,2,1884,4.817337461300309
2151276,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" attempts to recreate factually the last days of nazi Germany, centered within hitler's ""fuhrer-bunker.""  In recreating the final fall of hitler and the nazis, the story includes final futile attempts to defend Berlin (including by ""Hitler Youth"" members), final meetings and strategizing by Hitler and his prominent military leaders, and Goebells' and Hitler's final acts all leading up to the deaths of Goebbels and Hitler prior to final surrender.

I was familiar with some of this history via watching previous documentaries and interviews with some who actually lived those events (i.e. the fuhrer's personal secretary).  But the film puts the previous interviews and accounts all together into a docu-drama type film.  The movie should be very interesting for history buffs, and by rights should have won an Oscar for best foreign-language film.

This movie was also partly land-breaking and controversial as I believe it included one of the first times a german-speaking actor played the leader of the 3rd reich.

I think the filmmakers felt at least some pressure to spin things somewhat and not make the Nazi figures appear very sympathetic. I'm personally most interested in just seeing the truth and facts of what happened...or as best we can tell from the evidence and first hand accounts...and leaving it to the audience how they feel about it.  ""Downfall"" for the most part appears to be an attempt at just that - recreating factually the final days in Hitler's ""fuhrerbunker"" in Berlin just prior to its downfall.",1422144000,,1538,5.17741935483871

The film addresses this ponderously but when it should, it doesn't pull any punches.

2151342,5,B0002Z16HY,"I am typing fast so please excuse the grammar.

This is the best World War Two film I have seen to date.  It shows a realistic portrait of Hitler. as though he crawled right out of a documentary. It details the events and personality and explores what it was like those last few days living in that bunker living with Hitler and his Nazi criminal friends and sycophants.

 You see Hitler expressing what appears to be friendliness and emotion at times just like other humans, rather than only the meandering diatribes and huffing his portrait is usually restrained to. Critics feared by showing him too real would inspire sympathy. One critic even asked ""is this a sufficient response to what happened"", another posing the question ""should the monster be portrayed as a man"".  To my knowledge Hitler was a human, a very vile one, but when has being human ever prevented the worst imaginable monsters from existing among them?  By asking such an obtuse and incoherent question, one suggests humans should not try to learn about the most unpleasant of human history but shy away from it.  Not only does this film show you what happened from the eyes of survivors who were there (in particular his secretary), but it makes him seem far WORSE than the cartoons presented in prior film.  He is portrayed here between the smiles and self-pitying as utterly loathsome, hypocritical, manipulative, hate filled, and destructive to anybody who was gullible, unlucky, or reprehensible enough to closely connect to him.

  Anybody who finds Hitler in this film sympathetic or likable simply because he is more than 1 dimensional in his behavior, is disturbed.  The actor playing Hitler has his voice down, his mannerisms, there are even actual quotes from Hitler, Goebbels, and so forth. You see his wife and friends dancing and trying to exorcise their cabin fever, fear. and pretend everything is okay while ignoring the explosions outside signaling their violent death was imminent and likely going to be self-inflicted.  Hitler and equally as offensive Nazis such as the pathetic Goebbels, snidely ridicule the German survivors for their failure to win for them, display indifference at any misery but their own,for their behavior, and demonstrate nothing but contempt for anybody other than themselves.  It is a far more chilling portrait of a human monster than seen in film previously and a masterpiece",1393804800,4,2397,5.005037783375315

2151348,5,B0002Z16HY,"This story of the last 2 weeks of Hitler's Third Reich is the best WWII film I've ever seen. It combines several stories: Traudl Junge's book is closely followed in her story as Hitler's Secretary (see her film and book), then the story of a Wehrmacht/SS doctor who tries to care for the civilians and wounded in the Russian attacks on Berlin, the story of a Hitler Youth boy who's conflicted as his world and idol of the Fuehrer implodes, the story of the last days of the bunker. Fast paced and from sources who lived thru the experience. Well done. Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler is chilling - not a parody of Hitler - rather a multi-dimensional character who is believable for the first time since anyone ever attempted this difficult role.  Subtitled in English, I found I've watched this story many times, as I learn the dialogue, then I go and watch the actors, their expressions and the interplay of the others. The supporting actors playing Eva Braun, the Goebbels family, Goering, Himmler, Speer, the secretaries, the medical doctor, and the young boy are incredible - a plus to this film is a discussion of the actors about the heinous characters they portray.

Disturbing does not accurately describe it.  I have not had the courage to watch it a second time.  But it is by far one of the most emotionally moving films i have ever seen.  Little to no sound track gives this account a almost documentary feel.  Having a interview of the real Trudi Junge at the prelude to the film, her unflinching admissions about her complacency as a young person reflects the same unflinching direction and portrayals of a doomed group of people inflicting unspeakable horror and pain on themselves after years of inflicting it on the world.  Very disturbing depiction of humanity at its worst.  One day i will watch it again.  The acting and directing are benchmark performances by just about everyone in the cast.

2151359,5,B0002Z16HY,"I cannot say enough about the power and impact of this extremely well made film. To say it is intense is the understatement of the year, and it's not for the faint-hearted. The attention to detail - historical accuracy, people involved, uniforms, equipment, the bunker complex itself, the dialog - all are superbly researched and presented. I got the movie from Amazon and watched it several days ago. However, the stark images from the film are still vivid in my mind. The surreal and claustrophobic feeling of being in the dimly lit corridors of Hitler's bunker come through loud and clear.
The agony of the final days of World War II in Europe are presented in an unflinching manner by a stellar German cast. Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler is far superior to anything similar on screen. The performances of the rest of the cast all bring those terrible days to light. This was a film that had to be made in Germany, as the Germans involved all seemed to want to make this the most accurate presentation possible. Having read several books on the subject (Cornelius Ryan's The Last Battle in particular), I can attest to their success.
I highly recommend this stunning movie for anyone interested in that cataclysmic period of history, or to those who just want to see how well a historical drama can be made.",1386979200,,1313,4.71304347826087
2151360,5,B0002Z16HY,"How many versions of this are on You Tube? But it is necessary to see the original. Endlessly fascinating portrayal of Hitler. The Eva Braun character is pretty well done too. The Goebbels character is as tall as a giraffe whereas the original was a midget. That was somewhat jarring. The character is portrayed as somewhat looney too, where Goebbels himself, evil as he may have been, was something of an evil genius. So I didn't buy that portrayal. Some of the others are difficult to recognize. But all of that is of little significance because the issue here is the nuances given Hitler's character. I think Hitler's psychology is a mystery: how did he end up such a genocidal maniac. Yes, it was politically convenient, but he seemed to believe it too, and the reasons are a mystery. The movie doesnt and cannot address this issue, but it does show Hitler in several different lights, reminding us what an enigma he was.",1386806400,,925,4.680981595092025
2151361,3,B0002Z16HY,"It is very difficult to review a movie like this. The subject is one of the most repugnant characters in history. Bruno Ganz delivers a pitch perfect performance as far as anything I've seen or read about Hitler. On that front, the movie gets the highest marks. His staff and generals too have hit the right balance of discomfort of serving a lunatic and being loyal to the end.

The female characters, particularly Lara, are weak. Junge is a doe-eyed dolt who seems initially taken in by Hitler's charm and then just stays for the job for, uh, four years? The movie ends with the real Traudl explaining that she had no idea what was happening outside the bunker even though she was typing up Hitler's thoughts and orders every day. I guess the girl didn't get out much.

The character of Ava Braun missed the mark wide. She comes off as a super loyal party girl. Nothing I've read of Eva Braun would support that.

Now this gets to my dilemma. The male parts are well done. The photography superb. You get a real sense of the bunker. But I have to say that too much sympathy is injected into some of the most vile characters in history by placing too much emphasis on the softer side of uncle Hitler. The Goebbels family come off more like the Von Trapps as the kids sing happy tunes to the adoring uncle Hitler and pappa Goebbels actually cries because he cannot bear to leave the old man to die in the bunker. Goebbels doesn't leave, and after his crying jag has his wife execute the children before he shoots her and then himself.

Okay, perhaps these beasts were human. I'll allow it.

I do not like that the real Traudl Junge got to proclaim her innocence and ignorance as the last word in the film. Hearing Germans proclaim that they just didn't know makes me ill.

Damn it. For that last reason, I've decided to take away another star and make 3.",1386374400,,1854,4.422287390029325

Now to the movie, I already thought it was a brilliant movie when I first watched it. Spectacular cast, all around great performances by everyone. I literally can not find faults with any acting involved here. Bruno Ganz, of course, deserves every praise he got.
but there were some minor details that were unbelievable to me that I, at first, put them down as probably the movie creator's own invention for the purpose of creating dramatic experience;

General Krebs speaking Russian,
Eva Braun saying ""I want to be a beautiful corpse"" ,
Frau Goebbels begged Hitler to reconsider on her knees.
Himmler saying ""Should I greet Eisenhower with a Nazi Salute or a handshake?""
Hitler kissing Eva Braun in front of his staffs
etc.

After watching the movie, I began an obsession of reading everything about the Third Reich. And you know what? It turned out, after reading the memoirs of Traudl Junge (Hitler's Last Secretary), Heinz Linge (Hitler's Valet) and witnesses interrogations by US Judge Masumano.. every one of these actually happened!

I'd like applaud the creator team who accorded historically accuracy to the movie down to minor scenes and words, something which puts dear Hollywood to shame.

There is a little book by Hanna Reitsch called ""The Sky Is My Kingdom"" that mentions a little about the Goebbles children. ""As I entered the room of Frau Goebbles {she does not mention Josef} that first evening, I was confronted with 6 little faces peering at me with lively curiosity from their double-decker bunks. To meet someone who could fly opened wide for them the door of their own lively little world. After that, they summoned me at each meal-time to tell them about the strange lands and peoples that I had seen, or to descibe my flights or to recount their favourite fairy stories. Each one of them was a delight with its open hearted naturalness and bright intelligence. Their concern for each other was touching, one little girl was isolated for a time in the next room with Tonsilitis and when telling a story to the others, I had to pause every so often so that one of them could tell the patient next door ""what happened next"". I taught them party songs and how to yodel in real Tyrolean style. The crash and thunder of the shells bursting above failed to disturb them. It was their ""Uncle Fuhrer"", as they had been told, busy conquering his enemies, and when the youngest got frightened and began to cry, he was quickly pacified with this explanation. Before the children went to sleep, I used to sing to then ""Tomorrow and it be His Will the Lord shall wake Thee once again, Tomorrow.......?""
As Hanna Reitsch was preparing to leave the bunker Frau Goebbles gave her a letter to pass onto her son from her first marriage serving in the Luftwaffe,
This was a culmination of a remarkable series of flights for Hanna Reitsch to get to central Berlin in the last days of April 1945 with Von Greim to enable Adolf Hitler to name him to replace Goring as head of the Luftwaffe, even the plan to use a helicopter did not work out so they had to use a fighter to land on the east-west Highway finishing near the Brandenburg Gate under heavy fire, it would have been a lot easier to send a note. First there was a 4:30am flight in a Focke Wulff 190 with an escort of 30-40 fighters to the only airport not in Russian hands, a surrounded Gatow airport on the outskirts of Berlin, then a 30 minute low low flight in an Arado 96 under heavy fire to the Brandenburg Gate with Reitsch landing the plane leaning over a wounded Von Greim.

2151371,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is a stunning film that chronicles the demise of Adolf Hitler and The Third Reich at the very end of World War Two. Although the story is told primarily from the perspective of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge (played to perfection by Alexandra Maria Lara), quite a bit of the film focuses directly on Hitler's mental decompensation during the last days of the war when he and most of his inner circle where living in the Fhrerbunker (""Leader's bunker""), an air raid shelter underneath the ground in Berlin. The film is well directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel; his use of light, camera angles, suspense, fear, shock and more makes Downfall all the more powerful and unforgettable. The musical score, while not extensive since this is obviously not a musical, enhances the film as well. With all of these very sophisticated and thoughtful aspects to the film, I felt like I was truly there in the bunker with Hitler and his inner circle during those last few days of The Third Reich--this film is that kind of incredible experience!

We initially see a young Traudl Junge being chosen by Hitler himself to be his secretary in 1942; but after just a few brief minutes the location changes to the Fhrerbunker at the end of the war and the chaos inside the bunker. One by one, Hitler's top men are either telling him that their armies have been killed off by the enemy (which Hitler denies because he can't accept the reality of it all) or they are defecting and proposing peace treaties and surrenders to the Allies including the Communists which also infuriates Hitler. Bruno Ganz couldn't have done a better job portraying Hitler; he even studied Parkinson's patients to get down that shaky hand movement Hitler had during the last months of his life after a failed murder attempt in 1944. Juliane Khler portrays Eva Braun with such a nuanced performance that I was amazed and very impressed; the same goes for Corinna Harfouch who plays Magda Goebbels and Ulrich Matthes who plays Joseph Goebbels. Indeed, I could go on for quite a bit telling you just how brilliantly every actor appears in this film; every performance is striking and memorable. In particular, look also for the wonderfully talented young man Donevan Gunia who plays Peter Kranz, a lad who destroys two tanks in one day and gets a medal for his actions from Hitler himself. I also particularly admired Heino Ferch's performance as Albert Speer; Christian Berkel's tour-de-force performance as Doctor Ernst-Gnther Schenck who has at least some compassion in his heart; Thomas Kretschmann as Hermann Fegelein; Andr Hennicke as General Mohnke; Ulrich Noethen as Heinrich Himmler; Christian Redl as General Alfred Jodl; Gtz Otto as Otto Gnsche; Thomas Thieme as Martin Bormann; Gerald Alexander Held as Walter Hewel; Bettina Redlich as Constanze Manziarly and the footage of Traudl Junge herself before and after the film all add to the remarkable impact this motion picture had on me.

Downfall is an excellent, must-have film for anyone studying The Third Reich; Adolf Hitler and his inner circle and European history during the 20th century in general. In addition, fans of the actors will want to get this for their collections.",1380412800,,3202,4.938775510204081

2151377,4,B0002Z16HY,"All ""true"" stories take a specific viewpoint, be it an autobiographical one or something determined by a scripter. This is unavoidable. The German-made biopic DOWNFALL is no exception. In this story of Adolf Hitler's last days, he's depicted as what he was: both a compassionate person and a deranged dictatorial monster. This attempt at honesty is admirable, and yet, the filmmakers exercise restraint, perhaps respect, in dealing with his and Eva's suicides. They're simply not shown, nor do we see their faces afterward.

This same method is used when Goebbels and wife die in the courtyard: the camera discreetly cuts away. I'm not lusting for gore, but what would've been so wrong in actually witnessing the ignominious ends of two of the worst villians in history (Hitler and Goebbels)?

By contrast, Frau Goebbels, who only hours earlier was anointed by der Fuhrer as ""Germany's best mother,"" drugs her five children with a potion and once they're incapicitated she kills them by breaking cyanade capsules into their mouths. These horrific acts are shared with us in their entirety.

It's troublesome. Lesser Nazis are seen blowing their brains out, so not showing Adolf or Josef doing so is a choice that sends a message, albeit not a loud one, to the viewer about the meaning of these figures to the German people, even in death.

That's the only issue I take with what is an extraordinary and often nerve-shattering film, one that otherwise constantly rings true and is in fact a must-see for military history buffs.",1377475200,4,1526,4.996062992125984

2151385,5,B0002Z16HY,"Bruno Ganz is absolutely compelling in this performance of Hitler's final days.  There has been some criticism of this movie for tending to romanticize the doomed occupants of the final days in the bunker, but I disagree.  Although some of the charecters come accross as desparate, the contrast between those accepting their fate and fanatics loyal to end is dramatic and distrubing.  Ganz portrayal of Hitler is chilling - at times quiet and disinterested, and suddenly riping into subordinates with the fury of a madman.  The movie is in German and well it shoud be - you get the full effect of Hitler's mania.  Although the movie will appeal to WWII buffs, the movie is a charecter study of a tyranical leader and blindly loyal followers, all trapped in a fate that they created.  Highly recommended.",1374624000,2,803,4.867647058823529
2151386,5,B0002Z16HY,This is an all time classic! Rates up there with 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Das Boot'. Historical accuracy and characterizations are incredible! If you've seen the photos from WW2 you will see those scenes portrayed here. Only thing I would like is one dubbed in English. Reading the subtitles detracted from the fabulous visuals of this film.,1374537600,,343,5.035087719298246
2151387,1,B0002Z16HY,"This story is repetitive: within 10 minutes Russian artillery is shelling Berlin and Hitler is in his bunker being delusional about his chances and refusing to save German civilians. Two hours later, Russians are still shelling the bunker, Hitler is still in his bunker being delusional about his effort and condemning the German people to die.

This story does not have a Controlling Idea. Hitler falls, yes. He grants death to Germany and the German people with his downfall, yes. But what other plot is grinding against this downfall plot to create meaning? Nothing substantial. So the best I can come up with for a Controlling Idea is based on the single plot of his downfall, that ""Evil Falls"". There are attempts at sub-plots: Junge's escape from the bunker (but she is implicated in Hitler's crimes and confesses at the end, so it doesn't really grind against the main plot), Peter's realization that being a Nazi soldier is no good (but this is a result of Hitler's downfall plot and does not affect the downfall plot), and the good doctor and even Albert Speer the architect trying to talk Hitler into sparing German civilians. But all these attempts do not coalesce into any coherent substance to interact with the downfall plot. Instead, they are only additional portraits of the insanity of Nazi Germany and its leader. They show us a picture rather than make us feel the story through plots interacting to create meaning.

The only thing making us sit through the 2 hours to find out what we already know happens at the end is the allure of the fact that this is a true story: that these characters will stand for trial at Nuremberg and be hanged or put in prison or shamed for the rest of their lives.

Ironnically, William Shirer's non-fiction The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich has a more powerful Controlling Idea than this drama.

I agree those are powerful scenes, although repetitive (Mrs Goebbels force feeds her children twice, sleeping pills then cyanide). My problem is their delusion is unchanged from beginning to end so I don't feel the impact of the story as much. Even Tom Cruise's Valkyrie has change: his assassination attempt fails, his life ends, the Reich goes on. But Junge doesn't undergo much change from beginning to end. So take your controlling idea, that their ideology leads to insanity. Their idealogy is unchanged and their insanity is unchanged from beginning to end. So its not so proven to me...

So Valkyrie tries to prove something like Fighting Evil is worth dying for since that's what happens (he dies after he fails to take out Hitler). But in Downfall, does ideology Cause insanity? If so the cause and effect is not shown through choice and action. I think the choice of Hitlers bunker days makes it a tough movie to make. So much screen time is devoted to accurate portrayals of the historical figures, and by neccessity, their personal loyalties and devotions to Hitler, that given what happens on screen, the central idea is almost that ideology is worth sacrifying the children for. We know from historical fact that the ideology is evil, but we don't see that on screen. So we almost have to watch the movie with the prism of historical knowledge, the bookends of Junge's shame support this. Meaning the movie between the bookends don't really stand on their own as a story...

If you remove the bookends and ignore the narrative focus on Junge. Then the story IS almost about steely dedication to ideology means even sacrificing your children. Hitler and Eva do this by sacrificing their lives to protect his legacy. The Goebbels go even further to sacrifice their own children for the ideology. Hitler has condemned his own people but he applies the same logic to his own life. So the film almost makes them out to be like martyrs and heros standing up for their beliefs till death. But we know the filmmakers are not suggesting this: because Junge is the main protagonist and she is shamed, and much screen time is devoted to the good doctor and Speer trying to do the right thing. So the story is trapped in having to devote screen time to Hitlers actions which contravene the idea they are trying to prove. I think a solution would be to make Junge go through more of a real arc, or devote an entire plot to one other character's journey (like Peter) but historical fact and the constraints if the movies setting don't really allow it. I was intrigued to learn from wikipedia that Speer avoided the death sentence at Nuremberg and a lot of what's known about the Nazi inner circle come from his subjective memoirs. So this is obviosly a sensitive and charged topic. But by making Hitler almost the lead character (by virtue of the amount of screentime and depiction) cant help but make him sympathetic and contrary to what the filmmakers tell us they are trying to achieve.

2151390,4,B0002Z16HY,"I know that Adolph Hitler put one in his brain pan as WWII came to a close. I know he was in his bunker in Berlin. I just never really thought about what happened in those final days. Thanks to this movie, based on the book by his secretary, I will wonder no more.

Here's the scoop. Hitler is in his Berlin bunker surrounded by some close advisers and generals and a few family members. The Russians are closing in, and the greater part of his army and air force are reduced to a few men and planes and scattered here, there and everywhere. He doesn't seem to want come to turns with that. His men try to advise him to flee and/or surrender so now he views all them as traitors. Finally it all caves in on him and he puts and end to himself.

This is a tremendous movie. It's shot and directed excellently. The viewer is drawn into the action and reality of the situation, not to mention the bizarre-ness of it all. Watching Eva Braun trying to keep everyone in a cheery mood is both sad and mind-boggling. There are no real battles here per se, but bombs and artillery shells drop and there are some small skirmishes. Seeing fifteen year old boys trying to take out Russian tanks gives you the flavor of how horrible it got for the German army in the end. Bruno Ganz, as Hitler, does an excellent job. How his mental, as well as physical being, changes as he unravels, borders on frightening. All the performances a good. And seeing how some of his closest people were willing to kill themselves along next to him was a real surprise. These were not fair weather friends. They believed in the cause down to their bones.

My only complaint on the movie is that there are another 30 or 40 minutes left after Hitler commits suicide. They spend the time showing the escape and post script for those who left the bunker. That's simply too much time. They should have wrapped things up quicker. Other than that this is a great movie going experience.",1373328000,,1946,4.3850415512465375

From the added perspective of wide travel around Germany, including a very enjoyable self-drive holiday in August 2012, it is clear that Der Untergang/Downfall is an example of a remarkable and highly admirable capacity of the German people to search their souls about where and why their society took so many wrong turns from its finest instincts in the Nazi era. Germany did not cease moral self-examination with the end of postwar Allied occupation, denazification, and the moral suasion exercised by victors against the defeated. Germany on its own account has gone far beyond the tokenism which may be glimpsed in Austria (try finding the Holocaust Memorial in Vienna, or identifying it when you find it) - or in Japan (the worst case, where executed war criminals are venerated in the Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese war crimes like the Rape of Nanking are airbrushed from history). No airbrushing of history, for instance, in the frank and confronting 4.7-acre Holocaust Memorial opened in 2005 on a whole city block in one of the most prominent sites in Berlin, a short distance from the Brandenburg Gate -- and less than 300 metres from the site of Hitler's demolished Reich Chancery; or in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials Museum opened in 2010 in the still-functioning Justizpalast (Palace of Justice) where the trials took place.

At the opening of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials Museum in 2010, then German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle (born in 1961) well summed up the evident soul-searching for national moral health, saying, ""German history reminds us how thin the lacquer of our civilization is."" Significantly such sentiments have been expressed powerfully, across the political spectrum, by German intellectuals who lived through the Nazi era - among whom Albert Speer was the only senior Nazi trialled at Nuremberg who accepted his guilt, spending 20 years in prison for his part in war crimes. The most prominent postwar survivor of the group involved in the 20 July 1944 Stauffenberg plot against Hitler, a descendant of a distinguished Prussian aristocratic and literary family, Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin (1922-2013), made clear that he regarded his role in the Stauffenberg group as minor compared to his postwar contribution to European peace and German moral renewal as founder and convenor for 36 years of the Wehrkundetagung (Munich Conference on Security Policy).

Der Untergang/Downfall is not only great cinema from German actors and moviemakers; it fits perfectly into what seems to be Germany's permanent national moral project.",1372809600,2,3318,5.78118609406953
2151393,5,B0002Z16HY,"April 1945, a nation awaits its DOWNFALL. A masterful film, and one that is probably the definitive war movie about the demise of Hitler and his cronies, and the demise of the Third Reich. The acting from all the actors, but especially Bruno Ganz who plays Hitler, is wonderful and it is I suppose a film that really lets people see what the last ten days of the surreal reality that was Germany in 1945. As well as being a great film, the DVD I bought came with an extra DVD which has all sorts of extras like interviews, biographies and the behind-the-scenes footage amongst other stuff. Even if you like all-action war films, this film also has quite explicit battle scenes too. All in all, couldn't recommend this film highly enough.",1372809600,,737,4.590909090909091
2151394,5,B0002Z16HY,"I studied this period extensively, trying to understand not the monsters but the people who committed the crimes.  To learn how it happened, and how could happen that a politician can turn a nation into (for lack of better words) raving lunatics.  People who felt justified to kill others, and who did kill others without remorse nor care.  This period in history is a remarkable warning to everyone, that to trust a politician to follow him closely is perhaps the most dangerous things a nation or a person can do.  The history is filled with charismatic people, who were able to influence the nation, to take over and become dictators, which always leads to disaster.  We, as people, so concentrate on the racism of the Nazi that we forget the far more important lesson.  While racism can and does kill, but racism needs Governmental power to sanction slaughter to an industrial scale.

This movie portraits this perfectly.  Yes Hitler is portrait as a person, but here is a rub HE WAS  a person.  By all accounts, he was very loyal to his people, he did care about the plight of Germans, he loved his dog, and in his way Ema too. Yet he also was unstable, paranoid individual, who at the end was exactly as portrait in this movie.

I have to warn people, this isn't a light movie, this isn't a heroic War Movie, it is deep psychological movie that has not only its history right, but also the players.  The pace of the movie is perfect, with the explosions, the blackouts, etc.. growing more frequent as Russians advanced.  The doubts and the torn loyalties of the soldiers gives the whole thing a human touch that I haven't seen anywhere else.  However by giving it a human touch you can't help but be drawn into the characters, their plight, their doubts, and fears.
It won't make you like the Nazis to be sure, Goebbels wife killing her kids is very much on display, and you never forget that this was brought by the fanatism to a man, a very broken man.

The most impressive thing was Hitler himself.  The actor should have won an oscar, he was far better than anybody else I have ever seen in this role.  I realize that foreign films are essentially excluded, but in this case it is travesty of justice that this actor didn't win.  He portrait the Hitler as he was, especially towards the end of the war.  A man who refused to admit that it was his mistakes that led to the disaster engulfing him.  A man going from nice to almost demonic in his outburst whenever news he didn't like came through.

I have seen a lot of war movies, although I am not a huge fan of the genre since typically war movies are either extremely inaccurate, one sided.. i.e. bad guys them, good guys us.  And most important all too often they glorify war.  This movie is different, it doesn't try to make up the judgment for you.  It gives you the characters and let you decide.  It portraits the hopelessness of the situation better than any other I have ever seen.  You feel claustrophobic, as bunker is pounded, you feel the choices and the people.  You are left exhausted but it is worth it.",1372723200,,3079,4.481149012567325

2151398,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall chronicles the final twelve days of the German Reich, primarily seen through the eyes of Traudl Junge, the Fuhrer's former secretary. As one might expect from a film dealing with war, there is considerable violence and brutality. The side story of a young Nazi warrior is particularly compelling. In quite an unorthodox fashion, Downfall's strongest showing is not in its honest depiction of consequences brought about by a totalitarian regime's final gasps, but in the profound emotion produced by the actors.

The prelude and epilogue, consisting of Traudl's brutal self-reflection, horror and regret is terrifying even alone. Under two minutes of her testimony points to the dangers of following authority blindly and believing in the infallibility of any authority simply because they are in authority. Rule by fiat endangers us all, and so does being drawn into the web of propaganda, accepting fuzzy, feel-good pep talks and speeches without considering the motives of the speakers.

Subtle expressions, glances and emotional displays serve to amplify the terror. Ganz is impeccable as the Austrian Monster. The dictator's insanity and tenuous grasp on reality is unmistakable. The rest of the cast are hard to fault. Goebbels' cold, indifferent demeanour almost makes his one superior compassionate in hindsight. The penultimate act of Goebbels' nearly defies comprehension. It certainly defies love, compassion and empathy. Eva, Hitler's short-lived wife, among many others, reflect and proffer a profoundly impactful glimpse into the horrors of war, the depredations that human beings are capable of when the only ""authority"" they are accountable to are heartless savages who demand absolute loyalty and command it in turn. If authority is given a pass in the realm of politics simply because of their status as rulers of a country, history could once again repeat itself. Germany was a republic before the Nazis seized power. Apathy among a nation's citizens was a crucial factor.

Despite being over two and a half hours in length, Downfall is never dull or sedentary. Some scenes may be difficult to handle, though. Occasional black humor softens the blow slightly, but the ubiquitous reality of death, destruction and impending doom is always present.

The extras include a making of feature and a glut of interviews, adding insight and rewatchability to this timeless classic.",1368662400,,2399,5.372340425531915

It was actually better.  While the DVD did not have quite the same level of detail as the blu-ray, it was much smoother and easier to watch.  I finished watching the movie in normal DVD and put the new blu-ray into a pile for sale on eBay.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, it is not worth it in my opinion.

2151408,4,B0002Z16HY,"There are a lot of movies about World War Two, and most of them focus almost exclusively on Nazi Germany. Granted, it is, by far, the most interesting time and place of the 20th century, and possibly of the last couple hundred years, but, in my opinion, the constant onslaught of world war 2 movies has watered down the menacing effect of the Nazi's onscreen presence, and, like many once-great things, it's become a clich.

That isn't to say there aren't exceptions, because for every ten crappy world war two films, there is one shining light in the darkness. Examples include 2003's `The Pianist' and 2008's `Val Kyrie' (yes, I liked that movie), but my favorite of the bunch is easily the 2004 epic `Downfall'.

This movie is simply incredible. It takes place during the final days of the war in Europe, when the Russians were closing in on Berlin and Germany was on the brinks of defeat. As the streets of Berlin are bombed to ruins, Hitler and his generals gather in their bunker, optimistically planning Germany's next move, only to discover that their situation is hopeless, and the noose around their necks grows tighter with every passing second.

The acting in this film is phenomenal. Adolf Hitler, usually portrayed as an inhuman entity void of any emotions other than hate, is represented here as a human, a completely delusional human, but a human nonetheless. He is a complex individual, constantly alternating between emotions, whether they be anger, fear, love, or regret. At first, he's stubborn, not wanting to accept the dismal outcome of his great war, but eventually, he accepts his fate, but in a most unorthodox way. In scenes of insanity and paranoia, Hitler declares that neither he, nor any other German, should be allowed to live after their defeat, believing that, since they have proved to be inferior, they don't deserve to live. It's an incredible character study, with a great performance by Bruno Ganz. If you're interested in Hitler, and who he was as an individual, then you'll find this film very interesting.

The film doesn't focus exclusively on Hitler, though. It also explores the feelings and situations of those around him during that time, including his generals, his girlfriend, his secretary, and a group of children. As their leader goes insane, everyone in this group must decide whether to follow him into suicide, or to disobey their once-glorious leader. It's a predicament that leads to many dramatic situations, including one particularly powerful scene involving the children, which is both haunting and disturbingly real.

In fact, everything in this film is astonishingly real. The claustrophobic sets make the environment look as cold and unforgiving as the characters that inhabit them, as does the brilliant lighting schemes, particularly in the bunker.

Though there aren't many battle scenes, the movie never fails to lose the audience's attention, and there's plenty here to sink your teeth into. If you're a fan of war films, or just great cinema in general, look no further than Downfall.",1363478400,,3054,5.013806706114399

2151412,5,B0002Z16HY,"The first half hour or so of the film will likely shock many viewers. Hitler is portrayed as calm, patient, and nurturing in how he treats the young woman auditioning to be his typist. You see his vision for a city of art. In the West, we're used to a cartoon version of Hitler the madman. So many aren't so prepared to see Hitler the man. If Hitler really were the cartoon version that is in popular culture, he would have not been able to do basic functions, like get a typist to work for him for several years, or work with his generals to conquer Poland and France.

This, by the way, is often how neo-Nazi sympathies start, by a young man noticing that the popular conception of Hitler is inaccurate and that he had some legitimate goals.

So the movie forestalls this mechanism.

What we see is a man under great strain. Any person who had the command of a nation and its army would likely have similar fits of rage. What is damning of Hitler is that we see him as delusional, moving around regiments that don't exist. We see those around him as sharing in his delusion, holding grand balls while mortar shells fall around them. Most painful is the sight of the suicides. The suicides aren't only the high command, the ones who would later be tried at Nuremberg and for whom it would be logical to commit suicide to avoid the trials. No, we see suicides of common foot soldiers, lowly officers, and others of low rank. This is beyond irrational. It is cultish.

Chilling is how many men killed their families, wives and children. Chilling is seeing Hitler in the end condemning his own German people for failing him. Hitler is not just evil. He is delusional.

Enough other people have already gone through its many accolades so I cannot add many, except to say that as a period piece, as a war piece, as a piece of history, and as a character study, it hits the nail right on the head.

Obviously some critics have taken issue with various angles of its treatment of certain characters, namely Adolph Hitler, but the truth of the matter is given the emotions that surround the legacy of the Nazi regime in general and some of its most villainous leaders in particular, I don't think it is possible to broach the subject from any direction, even the most objective one, without invoking strong opinions somewhere. We have to remember that most of the protagonists of this story did not its conclusion, so all history knows of the matter is from the testimony of the few who did - people like Speer, Traudl Junge, Keitel, Jodl, Goring, etc - all of whom had their own incentives to record events according to a certain narrative. The truth of the matter is there will never be any absolute truths surrounding so many aspects of the Third Reich, including its final days, but that does not take away from the power of this film in exploring these issues no less.

In terms of showing the shear lunacy and cruelty of Hitler, as well as his more insidious ability to win over others sympathies by projecting a more 'humanistic' side; the slavish and pathological devotion of his followers, notably Goebbels; the 'end times' hedonism in which so many of his other followers started to indulge; the sheer inability of so many Nazis to consider that some life worth living might be possible even after the collapse of the Nazi regime; and the fanaticism with which ordinary German soldiers and even civilians held out against the Soviet advance - all of these the film portrayed with grisly yet telling realism and accuracy.

2151426,5,B0002Z16HY,"The German film entitled ""Downfall"" is one of the best, if not the best portrait of the last days of the Third Reich I have seen.  This movie is more than just the final days of Adolph Hitler, it is the final days of the leaders of the Third Reich that stayed in Berlin.  This movie moves past the suicide of Hitler to include a look at those who replaced Hitler.  This group, led by Josef Goebbels, includes the last actins of Keitel, Speer, Himmler, Borman as well as others.  This movie is based on the first hand accounts of at least 3 people who were at the ""bunker"" and heard the words and witnessed the actions of the ""Downfall.""  It is as factual as possible and quite compelling.

The actors are superb.  As a history buff of the Third Reich, I can say that every little detail concerning the people the actors portrayed were addressed.  The likenesses of most of the players was astonishing.  It was easy to get lost in the movie and believe that at times I was in the ""bunker"" in April 1945.

The director was brillant.  He captured the feel and spirit of the time period and the downfall.  He put critical scenes at the right place.  Two of these scenes, the testing of cyanide on Hitler's dog ""Blondie"" and Magda Goebbels killing her children were immensely important and separated this movie from every other ""last days of the Third Reich"" film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downfall/dp/B0009RCPUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downfall</a>that I have seen.

The characters are portrayed without the usual stereotypes of the Nazis in US films.  The film focuses on the last twelve days inside Hitler's bunker, using the memoirs of Hitler's private secretary, who left the bunker only after Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide.

2151430,5,B0002Z16HY,"There are plenty of reviews of this fine movie to give the prospective viewer a good idea of the movie's strength's and weaknesses. Simply put this movie is a masterpiece in acting and it is all due to the brilliant portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. His portrayal of Hitler is postively ungodly. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guiness have also portrayed Hitler. Forget those performances. Ganz's portrayal of Hitler is as good if not better than Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X.

The movie received a lot of press of how the movie allegedly makes the Nazis in general and Hitler in particular look sympathetic, or at least putting a human face on their image which has persisted to this day. For those who have not seen this film, there is no worry about this. The film more than adequately portrays the evil inherent in the Nazi system, and, in particular, accurately portrays Hitler as a psychotic, a sociopath who in the end was glad to see his own fellow Germans die in the flames. To paraphrase his line at one part of the film, ""They [the German people] got what they deserved."" The movie does a good job in depicting the absolute chaos in Berlin during the final days of WWII, and the horror of war.

It is impossible not to put a human face on these people, because, obviously, these were people, evil people. The portrayal of the last days of the Third Reich in this movie is a personification of what Harrah Arendt called the ""banality of evil."" The film accurately portrays the upper echelon of the Third Reich consisting of sociopaths, but just as accurately portrayed the many, many others who were simply pencil-necked bureaucrats or career military people who carried out the orders without any questioning. True, there are some personages who are more noble than others, but no one in this film comes out looking good.

And how ironic it is that this film has provided fodder for the tens of viral videos of key moments from this film. Anyone who has goggled this movie on You Tube will know what I mean. In the end Hitler has become a laughing-stock, a figure of ridicule, a pathetic madman, raving the worst kind of gibberish.

He is eerily a Hitler, look-alike, without much makeup and his demeanor, the similarities are uncanny.

2151435,5,B0002Z16HY,"REVIEW REWRITTEN, Thanksgiving 2015.

There are actually three versions of this movie, as you'll find if you query in imdb:

*Hitler: the last ten days, starring Alec Guinness in the title role, 1973;
*The Bunker, starring Anthony Hopkins in the title role, 1981;
*Downfall, starring Bruno Ganz in the title role, 2004.  It is in German, with English subtitles.  I couldn't get the 'audio setup' features to work in my DVD player, so I'm not sure if you can acquire other subtitles, or if they are auto detected.  It is not dubbed, I don't think.  For me, that's preferable, as then you hear the original actors, speak.  This is the kind of movie you watch over and over, with sound off or on, just reliving the experience.

More on the differences: the first two films, focus mostly on the last 10 days;  Downfall does that too, but Hitler's suicide is in the middle; Downfall then goes on for another hour, showing the aftermath of Hitler's suicide, focus still on Traudl Junge's memoirs (Hitler's last secretary).

All three are worth owning, and can be watched side by side in a weekend, if you need to immerse yourself to get a handle on.. how could this happen?

DVD edition of Downfall includes two specials: one, a voiceover on why the movie was made, over live filming of the filming (showing the crew shooting, with camera angles of the scenes which are different from the official film).  Some deleted scenes are included, but not mentioned as such.  The second special constitutes interviews of the cast, in subparts.  Each of the specials is about an hour, and well worth watching.

Downfall then is the latest remake, and its expanded focus plus, as it were, corrections versus the prior productions -- to make it more real, the stated purpose -- makes it well worth watching.  But all three are really worth owning and watching over and over.

Even if you're already well familiar with Shirer and the other biographers of Hitler and Co. during WWII, even if you've read the many in-depth biographies, this portrayal -- especially because it's in German -- will grip you into that time, so you will experience it.

Again, do get this and the other two, if you want to grasp how a Holocaust could happen;  how WWII could happen.  It happens, when enough minds share obsessive, adolescent thinking.  And that very trend, is happening now, witness the religious fervor over Windows 10.

Technically, massive attention to common media like TV, radio, etc. provoke a shared-thinking, a kind of magical oneness which makes people susceptible to any silliness that comes along, so past is prologue.",1344384000,3,2605,4.806741573033708
2151436,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is very similiar to past movies, ""the bunker' and 'hitler the last ten days"" and this is the same story too. It's a terrible and true one. The merciless Hitler awaits his downfall  and so does the 3rd reich.  The last few months of the war in europe were among the most bloody too. But this one really takes what we know and makes it the clearest picture yet.  The direction and acting is first class. I can't imagine that anyone who has seen this movie can complain about any of it. It's a german movie and this blu ray is a all region one so you can watch it on your blu ray in the u.s. too.  This is truly a great movie though. It's like watching the end of a long tragedy and the key players are coming to grips with their fates. It has english subtitles too.",1341964800,2,768,4.066225165562914
2151437,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is unlike any war film ever made. Even at an indulgently long 2 1/2 hours, it's good enough to bear repeated viewings.

At the core of the most catastrophic conflict of the 20th Century, Adolf Hitler and his officers experience a meltdown of the Third Reich in their extensive bunker in Berlin in 1945, as Russian troops move in. This is an historically accurate account as only Germans could tell it: deeply conflicted, rich in detail, and amazing; a cathartic film in that we get to see the worst elements of the Third Reich and Hitler himself, in their final humiliation.

Traudl Junge, Hitler's young and beautiful personal secretary, serves as the innocent focal point of the story, a sane vantage point from which to view the debacle. Bruno Ganz plays Adolf Hitler with an unerring compulsion and a Parkinson's twitch, full of ironic and bi-polar denials of his own responsibility, nihilistic blame, and psychotic rage. Yet he doesn't overplay it. This is a three-dimensional, human depiction, not a caricature. The performance has no equal in cinema. For those wishing to truly understand, to penetrate the psyche of Adolf Hitler and his officers, no film has ever come this close.

Brimming with authentic details, Downfall also features a large and stellar supporting cast, most notably Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, Christian Berkel as Doctor Ernst Gunther Schenck, and Michael Medl as General Weidling. I was reminded that the functions of doctors and soldiers are exact opposites.

Downfall is, above all, a study of the breakdown of a disciplined command structure. Hitler continues to delude himself up to the end that his military will somehow turn things around, even as the bombs fall all around the bunker. Each officer of the Reich has his own reaction to the terror as the nation collapses around him. Some hope to survive, while others fear execution. Others see no future and do themselves in. Still others will follow Hitler into the scorched earth, blindly obedient to the end.

Eva Braun has come loose from her moorings. She remains cheerful, detached and bubbly throughout almost the entire ordeal, throwing parties and ""living for today"". Amidst the chaos and destruction, Eva Braun and Hitler get married.

Frau Goebbels kills her own young children in the film's most poignant scenes, first putting them to sleep with a drug, then methodically giving each of them cyanide pills. The film saves it's most damning portrayal for Goebbels, whom Matthes plays with focused, clinical detachment.

This is no medium budget production. Every detail, both inside the Bunker and outside in the wreckage of Berlin, from the exploding shells to the amputated limbs, feels painstakingly authentic and real. The result is 2 1/2 hours of immersion in a nightmare.

It is how loyal relationships and individual rationality are tested that makes Downfall both entertaining and educational.

Humans are social animals. We like to belong to something larger than ourselves, to be part of a role-structured environment. Once we become part of a group, however, it can be difficult to break out of it.

But our leaders often take us down the wrong paths. Obedience without thinking, allowing others to do our thinking for us, have time and again plunged the human race into deep trouble.

The portrayal of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels is that of uncompromising and unsympathetic individuals. This is fundamentally a study in irrationality. In the dark extremes of Downfall are some of the answers to the greatest mysteries of human nature.",1338163200,2,3566,5.078632478632478

Why always all the focus on one man, Hitler? Hitler didn't do it alone. One fanatic doesn't make a Reich. It took a complaisant,comfort-zone seeking multitude for backing. Joseph Kennedy who lusted to be President was an arch anti-semite and was ready to back Hitler. So much regurgitated maundering about one little man.

It is my belief, tho, that the fact he WAS human makes him all the more frightening. To many of his sycophantic followers, he was almost a religious figure. Obviously, to those in his inner circle he must have been extremely personable, to have gathered such a loyal following.  It's an interesting insight into what really happened there, from someone who was there, Hitler's secretary. The inner political struggles, the violence, and the disorganization of the regime on it's final days is almost never told, and has never been told in such a vivid way. It's scary to believe a man who is sitting with children on his lap, who look upon him like a grandfather, is at the same time ordering the slaughter of millions.",1331078400,3,876,4.718954248366013

2151445,4,B0002Z16HY,"I got this movie because I wanted to get a sense of what it was like in the bunker when Adolf Hitler committed suicide. The director and producer take great pains to research the events of those final days. The bunker is recreated from architectural plans of Hitler's original bunker. The uniforms are authentically re-created. This is a good movie in that respect.

However, it is not a particularly moving movie and it's not meant to be. It's meant to give a historical account and to make us think about how destructive an ideology can be. I was moved a bit during the moments when Goebbels's wife poisons her six children. It made me contemplate to what extent someone will go to be true to their beliefs.

I watch Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Schindler's List, The Sound of Music and a few other movies over and over again. I wouldn't watch this film again as frequently, perhaps a few years later.

It's a great movie. Not just good, but great. It's claustrophobic, dark and frightening well-acted. Bruno Ganz (a favorite of mine since playing an angel in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire, 1987) sizes up and brings down the character of Hitler in his last days, almost to the point of sympathy for the twitchy, repulsive, aging monster.

2151451,5,B0002Z16HY,"I remember seeing a documentary in the late 70's that focused primarily on a middle-aged woman named Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries during the final days of World War II, when Hitler & his retinue moved into the underground Berlin Bunker. I think the documentary neglected to edit the material properly. As it was I--and a lot of other people--thought Traudl Junge came across as a heartless Nazi sympathizer. There was a barage of letters to the editors of various publications complaining about it.

For one thing, you got the idea that she had been working for Hitler all along when, in fact, she was only employed after he moved into the bunker. This made a great difference. I believe this film was created, in part, to set the record straight. After all, she was only 22 & lived under the Nazi regime for most of her life. She was never in the Party (I don't think she ever in the Nazi Youth movement either.) Junge wasn't really responsible in the way the documentary (inadvertently) made her appear to be. As mentioned above, she was middle-aged at this point so it's hard to remember how young she was at the time of these terrible events.

This doesn't provide an excuse for the adults. There is a scene where one Hitler's staunchiest SS supporters realizes that there are only a few hours left before Soviet troops enter Berlin. He pleads with Hitler to allow him to get his family out, sure that they will be specially targeted for the father's involvement with Hitler & the war. Hitler gets irritated him and says to speak to him about it later. Haughtily waving him aside, Hitler adds airily that he'll take full responsibility for everything.

In the next scene the SS supporter has returned home for dinner. He is all beaming & smiles as if nothing had happened. As the food is being passed around, he takes two granades from the pockets of his uniform. Hands under the table so his family can't see, he pulls the fuses apart. The explosion blows up the entire room.

The acting, script, direction, filming & grissly special effects of DOWNFALL are outstanding. There was a Jonestown Massacre type feeling about it all. The fanatics went with Hitler--and dragged a lot of people unwillingly down with them. The scene where the steeley, coldly beautiful Magda Goebbels kills her children makes your skin crawl. She first had them drink a knockout concoction. One of the girl's knew what was coming & tried to resist, but her mother & doctor forced her to drink the sleeping draught.

Then when they were out cold, Magda places a cyanaide capsule in between the teeth and uses both hands to push down on the top of the head & under the chin to cause the ampule to break. She does this almost like a ritual for each victim, a sort of tragic, Medea-like figure. When the little body jerks, it's over. Then Magda pulls up each blanket as to cover the face, but in so doing she lays bare the feet. I think this was to show that she couldn't cover up what she had done. This was very much an upfront & personal murdering of her children because she ""didn't want them to have to live in a world without Hitler or National Socialism."" The parallel with Jonestown is clear.

There is plenty of gore & suicide in this movie (which is why it got an R rating, there's no sex in it--at all), but the violence is not gratuitous. DOWNFALL is an artistic documentary about real people & painstakingly researched recorded facts. I think it's message is ""Don't trust political leaders,"" particularly if they claim divine inspiration & order you to start killing people--including yourself.

There's a little more commentary I'd like to add:

1 My one complaint about the film was the excessive use of face putty make-up for Herr Goebbles. It made him look like a living skeleton & was unncessary. The depiction of the Goebbles relationship was interesting. He couldn't deal with any part of his children's murder--and left it all up to Magda. There is definitely a hint that the marriage had been falling apart for some. When Magda exits the deathroom, she collapses to the floor, gets herself together, and walks by her husband without a word, goes to her private room and lays out a solitare game. 10 minutes later both she & Goebles are dead. Personally, I think there was or had been a little hanky-panky between Hitler & Magda--AND I think Herr Goebbles knew about it.

2 The actor playing brilliant technocrat Albert Speer was excellent. Handsome, analytical, very much the Alpha male of the group. He's decided to leave Berlin, but pays a last visit to Hitler. He informs him that he hasn't followed his orders regarding implementing a scorched earth policy by deliberately wrecking the German infrastructure. He tells Hitler not to add more misery to the German people. Of course Hitler disagrees & refuses to shake hands with him, but when Speer leaves, Hitler sheds a single tear. You get the feeling that Speer was the only man who really got close to him. A Freudian would say that he definitely distrusted & even hated men. This ties into the Jonestown event. In order to tolerate the men in the group, Jim Jones had sex with their wives or girlfriends. This could have been the source of tension in the Hitler-Goebbels relationship.

3 Bruno Ganz turns in a stellar performance. It has to be seen.

4 The actress playing Eva Braun is very good. She's like cruise ship social director on speed, but she has her genuine & kindly moments as well, telling the secretaries to try to get out of Berlin. She confesses that Hitler's dog Blondie (what else?) got on her nerves and sometimes when Adolph wasn't around, she kicked her. Near the end when Eva tells Hitler that she will not leave him, in a rare moment of showing romantic affection, he kisses her on the mouth, obviously shocking just about everybody present.

Lastly, near the end when the Soviets are rapidly taking over Berlin, there's a scene where a girl 14-15 who's a fanatic in Nazi Youth, knows that, not only is the war lost. but also that she will probably be raped, makes her boyfriend kill her, then he almost immediately kills himself.

At the film's conclusion, Traudl Junge is again interviewed, this time as an elderly woman & she explains her sense of guilt, and in so doing, I think largely aquits herself.

She is now deceased.",1325203200,3,6322,4.658295964125561
2151452,5,B0002Z16HY,Excellent acting and probably the most accurate account of the bunker at the fall of the Reich. German language with English subtitles.,1325030400,,135,5.181818181818182
2151453,5,B0002Z16HY,"This film has almost the appearance of a documentary of the last days of Hitler and his gang inside the bunker.  Many of he actors who appear in the film even resemble their real-life counterparts.  The realism is enhanced because the film is in German.  Although The Bunker (HBO-1980) with Anthony Hopkins was excellent and Hopkins made a convincing Hitler, Bruno Ganz takes the part to a higher level; you believe you are looking right into Hitler's own eyes.  Traudl Junge, who was one of Hitler's secretaries, is, in essence, the  narrator of the film, and the film is based on her autobiography, Until the Final Hour, which was not published until just a few years before her death.  At the beginning of the film the now elderly Frau Junge describes how she was simply in the right place at the right time when Hitler hired her; she was not an ""enthusiastic"" Nazi; and she was overtaken more by curiosity than anything else when she applied for the job.  Frau Junge also wonders if she can ever forgive ""the child"" who went to work for Hitler.  There is a more extensive interview with a much younger Frau Junge in the old documentary series, The World at War, which is a very valuable source in and of itself because it was made while many of the major figures of the war were still alive to be interviewed.",1324944000,3,1313,4.533898305084746
2151454,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is a German language depiction of the final few days of WW2, focussing on the siege of Berlin by the Russian army and on the events that took place in Hitler's command bunker. The film presents these events largely through the eyes of Traudl Humps, Hitler's personal secretary, but it engages closely with other occupants of the bunker, and a several of the German soldiery and militia as they fight to defend an ever diminishing perimiter. Beware! It is no traditional war film and the fighting itself is barely depicted, choosing to focus on Hitler and his closest associates.

To call such a long film (and in a foreign language too!) ""spellbinding"" suggests something special and, I have to say, that's what you get with this masterpiece, in spades. From the opening sequence as the young, prospective secretaries are led into Hitler's presence for a job interview to the final scenes as Traudl tries to escape from the besieged city it's impossible to reach for the remote to pause the film even for a moment and by the time the credits roll, you will be emotionally and physically drained.

Of course, the film received its plaudits on the basis of Bruno Ganz's representation of Hitler and rightly so. Once again, I have to use that word - it is a spellbinding performance and to say that Ganz is ""convincing"" barely does him justice. It's a measure of this mastery that the recent YouTube take-downs of his ""Hitler rages"" rob the performance of /none/ of its jawdropping power. Nevertheless, it's worth considering the contributions from the other actors: Alexandra Maria Lara as Hitler's naiive, awestruck and devoted secretary, Ulrich Matthes as a distinctly creepy Goebbels and Corinna Harfouch as his icy wife, Juliane Khler as Eva Braun and so-on. All of these (and other characters) are played beautifully and it's easy to forget that one is watching a dramatisation rather than a documentary. Equally, the sets, although fairly limited in their breadth, portray the dying city and the claustrophobic bunker with chilling precision and in exquisite detail.

Perhaps the other interesting, and controversial, aspect to the film is its moral ambiguity. I felt (I have to admit) some sympathy for Hitler as his grand plans crash about his feet, his closest advisors desert him and his mental and physical health deteriorates. What an awful thing to say I know, but perhaps there is something to be said to understanding that ""evil"" is a very human characteristic... It's no spoiler to point out that all did indeed come to dust for him and his cronies and that we know well that in the end they got pretty much what they deserved. However, the film does work hard to show some of the suffering and loss of the true innocents of that period of history and, for that perhaps, the death of Goebbles' children serves the strongest purpose - a truly moving, deeply upsetting scene.

I can't vouch for the historicity of the film: I am aware that some of the events portrayed have been ""retouched"" to show some protagonists in a better light than they deserved but, taken as a part of the historical landscape of the rise and fall of the German empire, this is an important film.",1323302400,2,3193,4.821167883211679

2151458,5,B0002Z16HY,"""The Downfall:  Hitler and the End of the Third Reich"", is a German film that is the most accurate and realistic account of the final days of the Third Reich that I've seen.  The movie is at times visually stunning and at others, properly claustraphobic (much of the movie takes place inside Hitler's Fhrerbunker in Berlin).  The movie is in German and subtitled in English.

Much of the problem with the other film accounts of Hitler's final days is that they portray Hitler as a raging lunatic, rather than as a very flawed, tired, flesh-and-blood man.  While the movie does not portray Hitler as a sympathetic character (nor should it!!!), it probably gives as accurate of a picture of the man himself as possible from those final days.

In the movie's opening, you hear the real voice of Trudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, and then again at the end, as well as see her.  (Both were taken from a 2002 documentary about Frau Junge titled ""Blind Spot"").  These sections add greatly to the sense of realism of the movie.  Frau Junge is a central character in the movie, and her autobiograhpy, ""Until the Final Hour"", was undoubtedly used as a source for many of the scenes within the movie.

The acting is generally superb.  Most of the actors had an almost amazing resemblence to their real-world counterparts, which helped with the suspension of belief for the movie.  Of special note to me, were Bruno Ganz as Hitler, and Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels.  Ganz reportedly spent a great deal of time studying Hitler, copying his speech patterns and mannerisms. It could not have been comfortable portraying one of the most evil men of the 20th century, but Ganz breathes life into role of Hitler, and offers a nuanced view of the dictator.  Matthes as Goebbels had an almost creepy intensity to his character, just what one would expect from a fanatic, which was what Goebbels was.

The DVD also has a ""making of"" featurette, about an hour long, cast and crew interviews, and director commentary.  I thought the ""making of"" featurette was particularly well done.

Two nits.  First, the movie doesn't identify the characters very well ... it's often much later where you get the first intimation of who so-and-so might be.  It helps if you're familiar with the characters before the movie begins; otherwise, you'll be guessing who some of the characters are and what they do.  Second, and a Very Minor Spoiler:  The movie shouldn't necessarily be relied on as truly factual in every sense.  For example, movie implies Ms Junge gets away at the end, when in actuality, she's eventually captured by the Russians, although she was very fortunate in that some sympathetic people helped her avoid the fate of several others of Hitler's personal staff who were sent to the Soviet Union for 10 years.

In summary, though, this an outstanding film about the end of the Third Reich.  Five stars.",1315008000,2,2896,4.792338709677419
2151459,5,B0002Z16HY,"Excellent movie about Adolf Hitler, played by Bruno Ganz, and the craziness of his last days in the bunker as the Russians begin their assault on Berlin.

2151460,4,B0002Z16HY,"Despite some flaws, Downfall effectively recreates the last days of the Third Reich.  Thankfully, this film lacks the ""inventiveness"" that Hollywood bestows on historical subjects.

Ganz does a masterful job of capturing Hitler's decrepit body, mind, and soul.  The General Staff that surrounds Hitler is at their ineffectual worst, and the actress that portrays Magda Goebbels delivers a performance that is nothing short of disturbing.  However, the parts I found most interesting involved the officers charged with actually fighting to defend Berlin.  Generals like Weidling and Mohnke are represented more as professional soldiers doing their duty than as committed National Socialists, although the latter was undoubtedly true.  Despite glaring deficiencies in logistics, training, and a worthy cause, the defenders of Berlin took a huge bite out the Red Army before surrendering.

In the film's depiction of the Battle for Berlin, there is at least one glaring historical inaccuracy...the total absence of brutality by the Red Army.  Traudl Junge did not get away from the Russians as cleanly as the film's ending suggests.  The conduct of the typical Russian soldier towards German civilian women and sometimes children during the advance on Berlin was one of he worst atrocities of WWII, and most certainly the worst committed by an Allied army.  Much of the film was made in Petersberg, Russia.  Perhaps the script had to be ""politically correct"" on this point to obtain Russian cooperation.

Finally, there is a ""Making of..."" segment in the special features that contains perspectives by the actors on their characters.  Perhaps the translation is to blame, but much of their commentary comes off as a bunch of rambling nonsense.",1310860800,4,1740,5.352941176470588

But until Downfall, I had not seen a film that dramatized Hitler's life told in German, only in English. To see Downfall, the definitive dramatization on Hitler as performed by exceptional actors and in German is the icing on the cake if you will. For sometimes it does takes years to tell a familiar story before somebody finally gets it right.

The first time we see Hitler on screen, he quietly comes out of his private office to interview for a new secretary. Once he chooses his secretary, she attempts to type a letter he is dictating, but she panics and makes many errors. He calmly walks over to her and in the softest voice possible he tells her to try another draft. Hitler is played with the right touch of grace and irratic outbursts by Bruno Ganz. His eyes are wondering and very tired throughout the film as it is only a matter of days before the city of Berlin is doomed to be captured by the Russian military. Hitler knows it but he cannot will himself nor anyone else around him to even think of surrender. He beleives that only the strong survive and that the weak are to be treated without any compassion. For it is the law of nature to avoid compassion.

One of the most memorable shots in the film is the destruction of the government offices where the camera pans up to a grand shot of a rain of paper coming out of the large windows. It is only a matter of time before Hitler's staff begin to realize he has lost all sense of reason with regard to the ability to mount a counterattack. He makes military decisions based on what he sees on the map not on what his advisors are reporting to him. When his advisors try to tell him that they do not have sufficient military manpower to carry out an attack, Hitler insults all the members of the SS in the room as cowards who have betrayed him and the country. His outbursts are heard in the halls as well.

There is also the passion of the force of Hitler's personality to convince those around him who may or may not have faith in him that victory is still possible. When Eva Braun decides to throw a party, the guests don't have much time to celebrate when the dance hall is suddenly bombed. Hitler remains unphased by all the calamity around him as in one scene where he stands before an immense model of a future city of Berlin that will someday rise out of the ashes.

His unbalanced state is further evidenced when one minute he threatens to shoot a senior officer who has failed him and then suddenly appoints that same officer to a higher post giving more responsibility left by the departing officers who have fled Hitler's regime.

I honestly cannot find any fault with the production value of the film. Everything from the sets to the costumes to the fight scenes and the editing are all first rate. This one is not to be missed.

To be honest, I only learned of this film after my son exposed me to Rebecca Black's horrible ""music"" video(if it can be called that). Fortunately, one way to rid oneself of that horrendous experience is to look at all of the terrific parodies on YouTube. Ironically, one of those parodies led me to this movie as a clip from ""Downfall"" - where Adolf Hitler launches into a rambling diatribe - appears to be a favorite of those mocking countless other topics. In the case of the Rebecca Black parody, I nearly die from laughter each time I see Eva Braun telling the women next to her, ""You're my friend since you're on my right!"" Fortunately, I was able to stop laughing for a moment to do an Internet search and discovered that the clip comes from this movie - and I'm glad it did.

With all due seriousness, ""Downfall"" takes a chilling look at Adolf Hitler's final days in the bunker - as the Third Reich crumbles all around him. This film paints startling portraits of der F&uuml;hrer and many of his highest most evil minions. While it remains inconceivable that diabolical such humans could/did/still do exist, Hitler and his monsters are portrayed in a manner that is not only very believable but also emphasizes that they were also human - which makes this movie all the more frightening.

The whole movie, almost, is shot within the fuhrerbunker and nearby, and is thus limited to being very character driven.  Characters are quite accurate doppelgangers to their real life personae and don't try to demonize or sympathize with them much.  Particularly harsh and clinical is the murder by Frau Goebbels of her children... thenceabouts juxtaposed with the use of the same cyanide capsules on Blondi, Hitler's German Shepherd, to test whether the capsules really worked.  Hitler seemed more upset with the death of Blondi than Frau Goebbels was at the death of her babies.  All this is conjecture of course, but quite well done.  The actor playing Joey Goebbels has such a cold and demonic face, it seems almost a caricature.

I will leave out the famous scene of Herr Hitler's famous rant which is now immortalized on youtube in a thousand incarnations; but it was quite accurate to what I have spent my entire life reading about the man's non-public verbal intercourse and diatribe.

It's an absolutely great representation of the final days of the third reich. with agonising realism we watch as first line spectators the disintegration of an evil empire and of the man that ruled it.

This isn't the first work that showed that although the national socialism was responsible for probably the greatest atrocities the world have ever seen, they were humans (but it is IMHO the film who best shows the humans behind the monsters and their warped motivations). Following a ""cult"" of personality (like the fanaticism we see in the children fighting and killing themselves, or the Goebbels family - which the director gave the audience a nightmarish scene that probably we won't forget), a cult of the survival of the fittest, a cult of death where compassion is seen as a false virtue imposed by priests (reflecting the despise Hitler had for Christianity) and an absolute hatred for the Jewish people. But in each individual, although most have some or all of the mentioned flaws, we find small sparks of humanity.

Bruno Ganz interpretation of Adolf Hitler is spotless and supperb; Oscar winning material (weird that he wasn't even nominated) - it's by far the best representation of the dictator i've seen so far. But all the actors done a very good homework, they are all believable and excellent portraits of their respective characters.

2151477,5,B0002Z16HY,"A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime, centered on the Fuhrer's bunker, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to the fall of Berlin on May 8th. This is certainly a very compelling story (certainly one of the most important stories of the 20th century) and while it has been filmed before, it is the first time it's done in the German language. This makes the movie look far more authentic than when someone like Anthony Hopkins or Alec Guinness played an English speaking Fuhrer. And it has a neat framing device in the story as seen by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge. The more compelling parts of the movie, for me, are not the war scenes, but the discussions Hitler has with his closest aides and military staff: Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf, Keitel, Speer, Wiedling, Mohnke. Most of them know the situation is extremely critical, but they are reluctant to tell the Fuhrer, who is increasingly in denial, promising final victory even after the Russians are only a few kilometers away from his headquarters. Only Goebbels remains completely wedded to the Fuhrer's autistic vision. Even Himmler and Goering, realizing the desperate situation of the Reich try to unsuccessfully arrange negotiations with the allies. These negotiations never got to anything, but Hitler is furious when he learns about them, and consider them both traitors.
Bruno Ganz is brilliant as Hitler, but the movie is considerably helped by the strengths of its many characters. For example, Fegelein, who as Himmler's adjutant, tries to convince Hitler and the other people in the bunker that it's best to leave Berlin. Fegelein meets an untimely fate and has become the subject of many internet gags (more on that later). Or Eva Braun, portrayed here as the ultimate dumb blond totally subservient to his man. Or Magda Goebbels, who can be both cold and hysterical. Perhaps the only character whose portrayal is unsatisfying is Joseph Goebbels, since he is played by an actor in a heavy and ridiculous white make up. Also strange is the decision to have Goering appear in only one scene and without a speaking role, just looking impatiently at his watch.
I remember that when the movie came out, some critics thought the movie was pro Nazi, in that it understood Hitler too much. I think with time it is clear that this charge is ridiculous. This movie clearly shows the delusion of Hitler and the terrible philosophy of the Nazis: no compassion and ultimate indifference to the fate of their own people. One criticism is that perhaps the movie was a bit too long: most of the scenes involving the bald doctor in the hospital or the child soldiers could have been cut and the movie would have been better.
Of course, by now the movie is well known by the hundreds (if not thousands) of parody videos in the Internet where the original audio is retained but the subtitles are changed so that Hitler and his aides end up arguing about a lot of ridiculous and anachronistic subjects (like computer programs, sport teams, pop stars, whatever). Those videos are sometimes very funny (and they have been surprisingly resilient in time given the short attention span of fads in the web), but if the movie on which they are based was not powerful, they couldn't have thrived as they did.",1294790400,,3274,4.806737588652482

2151481,5,B0002Z16HY,"Bernd Eichinger's 2004 masterpiece ""Der Untergang"" is in every way a magnificent cinematic achievement deserving all the praise heaped on it by other reviewers here and by critics and audiences throughout the world. This is riveting and utterly convincing drama with five-star performances from all the leads and in particular a career-defining and oscar-worthy performance from Swiss-born Bruno Ganz as Hitler. Ganz is so consistently outstanding he dominates all his scenes. He shows Hitler in all his complexity: how he was able to inspire an almost mystical level of loyalty and fear from so many including his inner circle, most of the army generals and ordinary German citizens right until the end. He even has Hitler's Austrian accent exactly right (this would be lost on the non-German speaking viewer) and mannerisms observed from countless film records including the shaking hands thought to be caused by the progress of Parkinson's disease.

The main focus of the film's action is the drama played out in the Fuhrerbunker as Hitler interacts with Himmler and Fegelein, Albert Speer, various army generals and the dominant and ever-present Joseph Goebbels (played to perfection with cynical malice by Ulrich Matthes). Hitler rages against all who have ""betrayed"" him (the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, Goering, Himmler, the German people); exhibits maniacal and delusional behaviour by issuing impossible-to-execute orders to phantom military formations which no longer exist, interrupted by occasional periods of insight and lucidity. Others try to maintain some normality in the face of the Armageddon unfolding around them, even as they discuss the best way to kill oneself: cyanide or a shot to the head?

This main narrative is counterbalanced by several well-integrated sub-plots focusing on the hell-on-Earth of the Soviet assault through the streets of Berlin, notably SS surgeon Ernst-Gunther Schenck's (Christian Berkel) attempt, with a subtle mixture of thoroughbred military efficiency and genuine humanitarian sentiment, to organise the medical facilities to care for the thousands of wounded and dying in the city. Some of the Hitler Youth defenders are literally children, assaulting the Soviet tanks with Panzerfaust rocket-grenades and in turn getting killed in droves. SS punishment squads roam the streets seeking deserters, real and imagined, to publicly execute. Chaos and mayhem reign, but National Socialist order must nevertheless be maintained.

The film looks magnificent and utterly real. Despite the focus on theatrical personal interactions inside the bunker, the outdoor street scenes are genuinely cinematic and show the unfolding horror and carnage to perfection.

The only minor issue might be that for the viewer unfamiliar with many of the 20 or so historical characters in the film it's difficult, on first viewing, to understand who everyone is and where they fit in to the story. Brief subtitling below a new character on first appearance explaining who he/she is might have helped here. This is one reason why the film is actually more absorbing and enjoyable on second viewing, when the viewer has more familiarity with the characters.

Overall a great, great historical drama based closely on eyewitness accounts which succeeds both as cinema and as drama. Make sure you see the film with original German dialogue as spoken by the actors, and don't be conned into watching an inferior overdubbed version.

A seriously excellent film deserving five stars. For anyone interested in this period of European history or just serious about film: see it.",1293753600,,3594,5.431899641577061

2151488,5,B0002Z16HY,"Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall,"" about the last days of Hitler and of the Third Reich, is an extraordinary work. It avoids every single possible pitfall to be ""ordinary,"" to follow expectations, to present caricatures, to judge or preach or give in to any  agenda. A great, flawless cast supports Hirschbiegel in his quest for truth and humanity in one of history's most inhuman chapters. (Commercial release of the film is expected next month.)

The exceptional stars of ""Downfall"" are Bruno Ganz as Hitler, and Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary, whose diary was used in producer Bernd Eichinger's brilliant script. Another standout in the huge cast is Corinna Harfouch, whose  Magda Goebbels - and her businesslike killing of her beautiful children - will haunt you more than any great production of ""Medea"" has. Juliane Kohler does the impossible by playing a consistent, scatterbrain Barbie of Eva Braun, existing in a rather appealing fun world of her own, facing reality in just one moment - all the more stunning in context.

Ganz, whose portrayal of Hitler is so right and convincing that no one is likely to try to play the role again, attended the screening to receive the 10-year-old festival's first lifetime achievement award; he acknowledged the ovation with a shy and awkward ""Thank you.""

A big-screen war epic, a blood-curling but strangely intimate dance of death among men and women of various degrees of evil, not abstract monsters, ""Downfall"" also deals with issues of responsibility and morality, but in a way that such questions arise in real life - mostly peripherally and so easy to push away.

There was just a single instance of ""taking sides"" by the audience during this first US screening, and it came in a strange, confusing way (just like it would in ""real life""). When Hitler orders not to spare the lives of Berlin civilians (""there are no civilians in this ultimate war""), Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) sneers: ""It's not like someone imposed it on them - they gave us a mandate.""

There was some scattered applause in the Castro, but the vast majority of the audience remained silent, not wanting to score points in support of something both obvious and the deeply, complexly meaningful.

Hirschbiegel (whose previous dozen films were promising enough, but not the extent of this landmark achievement) even manages to provide a small measure of catharsis at the end, engaging deep emotions after two and a half hours of a potentially deadening chronicle. At the very end, after briefly accounting for the post-war fate of each character, and giving statistics such as ""50 million people died in the war,"" the real Traudl Junge - shortly before her death in 2002 - looks into the camera.

She begins by saying that she was very young when she went to work for Hitler and didn't realize the horrors taking place just outside the comfortable bunker - and you cannot help feeling instant, intense hatred - but then the old woman (whom we just managed to overlap in our minds with her young, vivacious self we watched until now) trails off, and says something else.

It was only recently, she says, that she saw a headstone for a woman in Berlin, who was born in the same year with Junge... and who died on the day she went to work for Hitler. ""And when I saw that..."" she says, with a look in her eye that reveals confusion, fear, knowing and not wanting to know - and the film ends. And you sit there.

Catharsis in not a solution or ""elevation""; it is an overwhelming feeling, a mix of grief and something close to understanding. Catharsis doesn't excuse Oedipus or brings Lear back to life, it just makes you *feel* something, unlike the response to ""50 million died in the war."" ""Downfall"" does the impossible: it ends on a note of a small measure of catharsis, the miraculous finale to a great film",1282262400,5,3858,4.821482602118003

2151491,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) does what few war movies do: it depicts war not as merely a series of historical developments or an inexplicable ""fog"" of horrors, but as a complex interweaving of psychology, inhumanity, depravity, and ultimately the strength of the human will and hope.  The underlying historical events are well known: Hitler, surrounded by the Red Army in his bunker in Berlin in the last weeks of April 1945, ultimately commits suicide by gunshot, just after having married his long-time companion Eva Braun, whom herself commits suicide by a cyanide capsule.  As many know, the last days of Berlin were very bloody ones, with German civilians, German and Soviet soldiers suffering heavy casualties for very little yet very precious ground.  Most sad of all, with much of the German Wermacht significantly killed, the NAZI apapratus began to recruit younger and younger ""soldiers"".

""Downfall"" starkly and graphically depicts the suffering of Germany's civilians, who ultimately were the biggest victims of Hitler's inhumanity (both Jewish and non-Jewish alike).  The NAZIs did not spare their evil even from their own family members, many of whom were unwillingly murdered before the Red Army captured Hitler's last refuge.

I have read some reviews that critize that ""Downfall"" depicts Hilter and the NAZI high apparatus as almost ""human"", and thus might elicit sympathy for the regime.  While ""Downfall"" does depict some moments of seeming humanity (it was documented, for example, that Hitler could be kind to his secretaries and workers, and was very caring towards his German Shepherd ""Blondi""), these punctuated moments of humanity do not take away from the ultimate complexity and human tragedy that defined Hitler. If anything, ""Downfall"" offers a very important lesson: Hitler, far from being some unimaginable monster, was all too human. And if Hitler was really human, then Hitler's own personal ""downfall"" is one that is not impossible to imagine in ourselves. The real take-home message is that we are all capable of evil, perhaps not of the same level as Hitler of course, but evil nonetheless.

Bruno Ganz does a remarkable job recreating not only Hitler's mannerisms and hand twitches (it is now suspected Hitler may have had early Parkinson's Disease), but also the inflections and intonations of his voice. While there is little recorded evidence depicting Hitler's voice outside of the infamous Munich rallies (where ultimately Hitler was yelling more than conversationally speaking), the one existing recording of Hitler speaking in a conversational voice is said to have been carefully studied by Ganz in preparation for his role. Ganz looks, sounds, and acts almost so convincingly that at times you almost feel you are witnessing Hitler himself.

The horrors of war ultimately cannot be ""whitewashed"". Some war movies paint the war in glorious, patriotic brush strokes (especially the war movies of the time). Others ridicule and dehmanize NAZIs to the point where they become almost caricatures.  ""Downfall"" does neither: it depicts what most likely happened in Hitler's bunker those last ten days of April 1945.  We see between moments of abject horror and despair short glimpses of humanity and hope, especially from the point of view of Hitler's secretaries, who were some of the few to survive.  The extent to which individuals like these, farther extended from Hitler's inner circle, were complicit in his crimes is uncertain. But it is evident that to whatever extent they believed in the mythology of NAZIsm and Aryanism, it was devastatingly demolished in the last days of Hitler's Reich.

There are no heroes in ""Downfall"". And while the villains were always obvious, the real fact is that war leaves no one sinless.  To show otherwise is to polemicize or romanticize, something that objective historical drama should not do, and which ""Downfall"" luckily does not do itself.",1278892800,2,3923,5.256

2151496,4,B0002Z16HY,"Naum Vaiman, an author based in Holon, Israel shares this train of thought:

We had planned to become people like all peoples but instead of it we became ""not this, not that.""

Two movies are in my scope: a Russian one--""Moloch"" (1999, Alexandr Sokurov) and a German one--""Der Untergang (2004, Oliver Hirschbigel).  The last one ""Der Untergang [Demise of Gods]"" correlates well with German mythology and connects with a link Wagner-Hitler .
Mr. Sokurov is an outstanding filmmaker who tries to find the elusive Russian identity.  He is looking for it in landscapes, soulscapes, in Platonov's  writings [Platonov was a Hermingway's guru] or in resemblance to Tarkovsky's surly and slow poesy. He is looking for ""the Russian soul mystery"" in his films about Lenin--""Calf""--and in his ""Russian Ark"".
His""Moloch"" seems to be a grotesque and phantasmagoric puppetry.  Hitler looks like Pinocchio who lost his Malvina. Furher is portrayed as an idiot and a psychopath.  But Hitler is more complex and much more interesting. Sokurov shows the Third Reich as a totalitarian regime (deception, slavishness, fear and discipline, all is very similar to the Soviet state).
I don't think it should be simplified like that since ""any beast is uniquely horrific"".
The scenes in Hitler's castle in the Alps are very telling. Idyllic life on the eve of the end is savored by the playwright.
Any artist's search for identity (the main problem of modern man) means to create the self-portrait.  But here Sokurov is looking into Germany, not Russia.
It is not accidental.  Russia and Germany are very close.  They are sisters.  Russian Czars were of German blood. Russian gentry and intelligentsia were very German and Russian culture is based on German ideas.
Yet-- being a Russian intellectual-- Sokurov positions himself higher than Germans.  I don't think such pride is productive because-- in spite of the Soviet Union's victory in the WW II-- the dialog of cultures is not over yet.
Choosing to portray leaders only, Alexandr Sokurov shows the modern Russian quest for a leader-father-savior figure.

The German movie Der Untergang shows the last days of Hitler.  Everything is serious (Germans pathologically lack sense of humor).  This is collapse of the Empire, destruction of dreams, demise of gods. It is impressive and worth of our admiration.  Everything is doomed but the state and military machine continue to work. They are laboring hard, working themselves to death. People fight to the last one.  No repentance and no reevaluation.  It is as if it should come later but at the moment Don Quixote comes to mind-- ""It is not our business to count enemies, our business is to fight"". Actors convince us that the German race is firm and amazingly solid.  Of course, we may call it foolhardy, fanatical and inhumanely cruel but the movie makes the German nation  powerful and important.
Incidentally there is no Holocaust in Der Untergang since the authors see the genocide of Jews as a small episode in the battle of titans. Hitler-- in spite of his fits of anger and his general depression-- looks very human and psychologically true (played by Bruno Ganz).
The Goebbels family infanticide- suicide is the most deep-felt scene.  Greek tragedy, literally... The Germans' affection for ancient Greece (starting wish Goethe) finds its realization in the image of Hitler's secretary resembling rather a Hellenic beauty than a perfect German blonde. [1]
It seems that the basis of all life, the only reason for the continuing battle on the edge of the unavoidable destruction is the devotion and being true to one's oath.  This is the supreme law.  In such a world there are no ""Jewish"" debates on ""it's worth it--it's not worth it"", ""advantage--no advantage"".  There is some supreme principle and its essence is loyalty. A tragedy is born and its pathos is heroism.
So, what's the ""heroism""? It is not personal courage or self-sacrifice; it is not an infamous ""love for death"" which is a favorite notion of foes of Germany and heroism in general.  The personal valor and self-sacrifice are functions of faith and loyalty. This film  shows the other logic different from the logic of advantage and gain and this logic of loyalty is elevated to the ""logic of history"".  But what's history?  Struggle for existence? Hitler's biographer Joachim C.Fest calls Fuhrer's behavior ""not fit for survival"". [2]
For Sokurov--a Russian thinker--history is a theater of marionettes and its script belongs to the theater of absurd. (It should be noted, though, that Russians lose this kind of attitude when they look at their own history). For a German--and this is the foundation of the German culture which since 19th century from Goethe and Nietzsche was enlivened by the ancient Greece-- history is a great tragedy. They forget along the way that this foundation long ago became the law within the Jewish religious system.  Outside this system, it becomes the rule out of context and turns into motto ""Conform!"" (""Morph and assimilate at all cost!"")  To reach a certain goal means ""calculation"" on the way to such a goal but ""calculation"" without a goal means just a momentary advantage.  With such a tool these people dare to probe history; their ""historic wisdom"" forms a state life rife with corruption of officials and proliferation of politicians without principles.
OK, let's assume we are not for great goals and the most important thing for us is to survive. But who has pronounced that survival is reached by adaptation and not by reaching the great goal? Almost 2,000 years ago the Jewish people were defeated by Rome and enslaved forever. But the nation survived and arose from ashes. Why? Perhaps, because of its adaptability...Was it because of its fanatical, mad belief in  return? Was it because of its loyalty and trust in G-d and its adherence to the faith of their fathers? The Holocaust precisely ""teaches"" us---adaptation and assimilation are absolutely fatal. Germans are not to blame for the genocide of  Jews, Jews themselves are.  Not in a sense, of course, espoused by Israeli writer A.B.Yehoshua who said -trying to explain the suicidal fervor of Jihadists-- that Jews so ""antagonize"" surrounding people that they feel ready to exterminate the Jewish people. It's rather in a sense of the European Jewry's strategy to assimilate, and also to self-negate themselves. Zionism was supported by the small part of the people. ""Where are you, people of Judea?"" sounded a desperate cry of one Zionist on the eve of catastrophe in the WW II.  This strategy of assimilation and adaptation deprives people of all moral and organizational tools for resistance while disarming people on the eve of terrible showdown.
Naturally, ""wise Jews"" would say: ""Look, what Germany achieved with her ""heroism"" and our ""non-resistance"" resulted in creation of the modern state of Israel.  I would like to inform these ""wise Jews"" that it is logic of Kardel who wrote a book ""Adolph Hitler-the Founder of Israel"". [3]
Histories of great nations do not end as a consequence of grand military defeats if the spark of faith and loyalty lingers in those nations.
One and a half  thousand years ago the Roman Empire was dealt a final blow in its centuries-old conflict with German tribes. Europe became a Germanic realm. Does the destruction of the Third Reich mean the end of the Germanic Europe?  The end of Europe?  The filmmaker Mr. Hirschbigel ""express hope"" for the ""national rebirth"". What is it-- ""national rebirth""? It is not an idle question for Jews.
Nation equals culture.  Culture is a pattern of nation's life, its fabric [in Hebrew MIRKAM KHAIM]. Devoid of its culture nation becomes just a  populace with some ethnic features (perhaps, people with crooked noses). It often happens that nation forms from several ethnic groups but their coexistence comes to be  plausible only in the framework of one culture--one language, one norm of behavior, one unity in the front of the course of history.
So what culture do we want to rebuild in the new old land? On which cultural values should we build a modern society? We often talk about a ""war of cultures"" in Israel. A similar war or wars  flare in  the entire world--Germans, Jews, Russians face cultural choices. Whose god will win in this war, whose culture will win? And whose culture won in the WW II? Could it be that all sides lost?
For the last two centuries two trends have been struggling in Europe--a universalistic trend and a nationalist one, Communism and Nazism. Both ideologies were pushed to the limit. They both crashed. Western Europe suffered more from the Nazis and it is not surprising that after war universalism gained ( along with human rights and rights of minorities). However there are deep conflicts between national cultures and alien minorities which do not want to accept a dominant national culture as theirs.
""Universalists"" of all colors try to level a national culture, to uproot it historically and religiously by suggesting all-encompassing culture of relativism.  But new racial and ethnic groups in Europe, mostly Islamic ones, do not want to adjust their cultural norms. Nations and nation states resist the newcomers' onslaught on their cultures.  ""Universalists"" of all creeds try to create a new basis for the desirable unity, suggesting ""all downtrodden ones together.""[Proletarians of all lands unite!] The resistance of old nation-states takes an old shape of xenophobic attitudes and anti-Semitism (as usual, Jews are in vanguard of struggle against national identity). As a result, political polarization, ""left"" and ""right"", nature of conflicts and the entire situation remind Europe 100 years ago.
This motion picture Der Untergang is full with German pathos of valor and hopeless struggle, national pride and national rebirth. By doing so the movie makers become captive by values held high by the doomed people of Hitler's bunker. It is not an accident when Hitler dictates to his Greek-looking secretary his last will where he acknowledges the victory of the world Jewry.  This is not a fit of madness; this is a reminder that goals stay the same.
""Centuries will pass and from ruins of our cities and artifacts renewed hatred will emerge again and again, a hatred towards the people who are ultimately responsible, the world Jewry and its allies"" (""Last Will"" in the biography of Hitler by Joachim C. Fest. [2]) One should try to absorb this and the fact that today ""resurrected"" Europe retains its deep enmity towards Israel. When advancing, Israel is hated for ""oppression of the weak"" and when retreating, Israel is despised for her appeasement. In the first rows of this hatred are the ""left intellectuals"", but why? Is it strange? No, it is not. Hitler in his ""Last Will"" and ""last talks"" (his listeners say in one voice about his ""characteristic clarity"" and ""bygone strength of thought"") regrets his lack of radicalism shown by the left, his bourgeois half-heartedness and sentimentality, his moral limitations. He regrets that he did not treat German conservatives with more cruelty, that he supported Franco and Spanish  aristocracy, that he chose church instead of  Communists and did not liberate the working class in France (from French relict bourgeoisie).  Everywhere, Hitler said, we should have uprisings of colonized people and we should trumpet awakening of oppressed and exploited nations, push the Egyptians and Iraqis to insurgency, all the Near East."" There was a chance of big politics related to Islam. It was lost"" (see Hitler's Biography by J. Fest [2]).
New Left troubadours think of themselves as ""people of culture"". But let me ask you, ""What culture?"" What culture do they want to rebuild or build anew?  Do they really think that the New Barbarians, for whom they fight with abandon, will start to bow not to Mohammad but to Shakespeare and Mozart? Or do they hope for the synthesis of cultures? I cannot fathom the synthesis between Kant and Mohammad. There is an old Soviet joke ""If we combine a rattlesnake and a hedgehog we'll get barbed wire.""
In fact, the left academia acts as if demolishing the national culture. If they become victorious the European Christian culture will end as the ancient civilizations ended. Hence all those defenders of ""human rights"" are digging the grave for their mother culture.  What for? For ""justice"", that is.  My acquaintance from the leftist circles once said, ""The main thing for me is to have a clear conscience"".  I asked him whether he is ready to sacrifice his own culture--it includes struggle for minority rights-- to sacrifice his own people. ""If this people are not chaste, he said, so be it."" Same happened with Bolsheviks. Same happened with Hitler who said, ""If German won't win they are not worth victory."" We deal with the identification not by culture but with the identification by camp of ""justice"".  Better yet to say ""camp of the just"".  This way is absolutely universal and almost religious.  For many it is a way to dupe their own conscience when instead of the concrete help for concrete people they lead an apocalyptic battle with the world evil which in turn capitalism or Zionism or imperialism and the savior or messiah is either ""proletariat"" or ""awakening Asian East.""
Even Hitler was no lesser ""universalistic"" than the European Left.  He also tried to build a world society albeit not on classes but on racial purity and the German people were just his tool, a savior of the ""rotten"" mankind.  When Germans failed in this role Hitler rendered a death sentence for the German people.
He said to Speer on the eve of his death explaining his order to destroy German industry: ""We should not pay attention to means which are needed for the primitive life hereafter. On the contrary we better destroy these ourselves.  Since this people reveal themselves as weak the future belongs now to a stronger eastern neighbor.  If somebody survives after struggle they will be inferior people since all the worthy people died. [2]
Labeling nationalism the main ""enemy of peace and democracy"", showing it as a way to Nazi ideology or religious fundamentalism (or into the maze of the narrow particularism) the Left willingly or unwillingly find themselves in the ranks of enemies of their own people, trying to weaken them or disarm morally.
But national identity is singularly natural and healthy foundation of a person, national culture does not exclude universalism, universalism is an important part of any developed national culture.
In his Pushkin memorial speech Dostoevsky characterized Russian culture as a culture of ""world responsiveness"".  The well known Slavophile K.S.Aksakov wrote: ""Russian people are not nation, they are mankind."" And German classic philosophy is universal, isn't it?  Wagner in his memoirs about Paris in the 1840s says: ""I was gladdened  seeing in German spirit some potentialities leading to all human spheres through constrictive borders of nationality"".
What's the leftists' alternative to national identity? The same assimilation project which Moscow philosopher I.N.Fridman calls ""unchoseness pushed to its limit"".  He writes, ""Assimilator Jew has his own phobia expressed in the hatred to any belongingness as such.  He feels that any belongingness or identity may serve as an evidence which can be used to exclude him from picture.  If a generic anti-Semite is ready only to eliminate a Jew as such, an assimilator Jew needs for his complete happiness to destroy the very idea  of identifying evidence of specialness and by doing so to destroy the foundation on which mankind stands.

P.S.
Many will be appalled by the phrase ""Germans are not to blame for the genocide of Jews but Jews are themselves to blame.""  I understand that and I must elucidate it. I won't hide behind the excesses of  polemical ardor and I won't try to exonerate myself.  I really feel this way: there is no hatred of Germans in my soul--it was in the past but it disappeared altogether after I had witnessed the behavior of Jews in their own state-- but I harbor a lot of hate towards some Jews.  Here is an analogy: whom should I blame for terrorism and unpunished rocketing in the south and in the north?  It is clear to everybody than any terror and shelling may be stopped in no time and everybody knows how to do it. But ""wise"" Jews say, ""Our power is not limitless"" ( Mikbalot  Koah ).  If we behave nasty, Europe will kick us in our butt and the USA will shut off the supply valves.  Such behavior is not profitable.  It pays to tolerate some loss of citizens to keep our high standard of living.  For a quick profit we sacrifice our brothers.  We are ready to evict our brothers from their houses because it would be more expensive to defend them.  Isn't it similar to the behavior of Jews in Europe on the eve of the Holocaust who ignored hatred and hoped that the last pogrom would be really the last one and their turn won't arrive?
In his June 8, 2005 interview (Israeli TV channel 10) Amos Oz said that he was happy to notice that both nations (Israeli and Palestinian) got tired from fighting.  I am curious where he got it from?  Oh, he is a poetic seer!
Here are two things for us to ponder.
First, the outstanding Israeli writer (he is very popular in Germany) expresses joy that his people got tired.  Naturally he is satisfied with the results of his activities. General tiredness is his favorite phenomenon; he thinks that it makes peace closer.  If facts are against it, it is too bad for the facts.  He is not humbled (his own words) by loud and hostile statements in Arabic, by terrorism, not even by Hamas victory in election.  It looks like G-d himself--patronizing great writers-- whispered something to him.
 I recall how our commander instructed us before meeting the Palestinian police, ""If they sometimes click the rifles, do not worry, it's their way to get nervous...""
However Amos Oz -his wordings are very deft-- unwillingly gave me one statement which I'd like to use.  He said that Germans as people are not to blame for the genocide of Jews but they are responsible for it.
Therefore I agree to change my phrase ""Jews are not to blame for the Holocaust but they bear the responsibility for it"".
If -as a result of the mortal tiredness of the nation-- a new genocide happens who should we to blame or ""lay responsibility on""? Arab terrorists?  Or, perhaps, those stupid and cowardly leaders in politics and spiritual life who push so hard towards ""mortal tiredness""?

How any could work for such a tyrant is beyond me....except for the ""power"" he granted them while things were going in their favor.  You would have thought the Generals would have seen this totally deranged person for what they were thus they are all are at fault for letting this go on until the utter destruction of a country.  An important film for history and ANY PEOPLE which allows at any time arrogance within their ""leaders"" to rum amok.",1272672000,,629,4.648648648648648

This film is very precise in terms of War, Politics and decent emphasis on Sir Adolf Hitler's persona. The 'Hitler' of whom we had brief flicks in several war documentaries or maybe some films depicting wars, this is a totally different side of the man, have the pleasure to witness Hitler as a plain human being, watch him as he exposes his heart to you in the film, watch him undergo different emotions, the film is a remarkable piece of Biography, a splendid cast following Bruno Ganz as Hitler himself, he is phenomenal and simply breathtaking, a remarkable performance by Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Kohler.

2151501,5,B0002Z16HY,"This movie is an excellent portrayal based on the recollections of a minor clerical worker who was in the bunker during the last days before the Russian entry into Berlin.

You are drawn horrifically into the fatalism of Hitler's most fanatical supporters; into the fear and disbelief of those trapped in the bunker as they gradually begin to realize what their position really is. And the scenes of Berlin, bombed to ruin, are heartbreaking.

I bought this movie as a gift for my grandson, who is interested in the phenomenon of Hitler's journey to power from obscurity. I found the movie and paid for expedited delivery so it would arrive on December 24; as I tracked the status of delivery, I saw it had been delivered to the wrong address and gave up on a timely Christmas delivery; but about 4:00p.m. it did arrive.",1266883200,,820,4.6875

The major players of the Nazi regime are all represented.  The story doesn't just portray them as one note villains--rather it paints a picture of all shades with acts of courage and evil alike, honor and deceit.  Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler.  The entire cast is fantastic as is the story.  The only thing that may turn people off is that the film is entirely in German with English subtitles.  You can't get much better than this.",1265673600,,557,4.465346534653466
2151503,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a very well-made semi-documentary about Hitler's final days. The sets, the acting, the dialog are all excellent.

After seeing the movie, my main question was how much of the events and speeches were historical and which parts were fictionalized, written for the movie? For example, the horrific speeches by Goebbels and Hitler to the effect that the German civilian population deserved to suffer now because they had proved to be weak - how do we know Goebbels actually said that? I wondered, because some aspects of the movie were clearly fictionalized to make a better story. For example when the heroine, Hitler's secretary played by the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara, escapes Berlin after the downfall, it would not have been the gentle bicycle ride in the countryside as depicted. In reality, she could not have - and in actuality did not - escape from the systematic massive gang rapes of German women by Russian soldiers in the aftermath of May, 1945.

But in trying to read more about the historically accurate story, what I discovered, to my surprise, was the remarkable level of continuing discomfort that still prevents many from coming to grips with the Hitler era, especially within Germany, 65 years down the road. For example, this movie was itself virtually ignored by the German press. Some complained that the depiction was too kind to Hitler and the others, humanizing them by showing their tenderness within their own families. Others were afraid the movie would encourage Neo-Nazis. The Third Reich was supposed to last a thousand years. Apparently what will take a thousand years is for Germany to be able to deal with it.

I never was able to find out if the dialog was historically accurate.",1265500800,,1722,4.931034482758621
2151504,5,B0002Z16HY,"This movie was an excellent recreation of the events that took place days leading up to Hitler's end and VE day.
The acting was flawless.  There were no excessive exagerations, just superbe performances by the actors portraying the most evil men in history.
The actor who played Goebells was spot on, physically and the way he captured his vile personality.
Bruno Ganz did a superb performance as the doomed dictator. Capturing his typical rages to his distance from reality.
You saw the grity reality of the war's impact on those trapped in Berlin before the Russians entered.
The innocent and the fanatical.
I STRONGLY recommend this movie to WWII history buffs and those interested in one of the darkest and most fascinating chapters in human history.",1264464000,,754,4.984126984126984
2151505,4,B0002Z16HY,"All ""true"" stories take a specific viewpoint, be it an autobiographical one or something determined by a scripter. This is unavoidable. The German-made biopic DOWNFALL is no exception. In this story of Adolf Hitler's last days, he's depicted as what he was: both a compassionate person and a deranged dictatorial monster. This attempt at honesty is admirable, and yet, the filmmakers exercise restraint, perhaps respect, in dealing with his and Eva's suicides. They're simply not shown, nor do we see their faces afterward.

This same method is used when Goebbels and wife die in the courtyard: the camera discreetly cuts away. I'm not lusting for gore, but what would've been so wrong in actually witnessing the ignominious ends of two of the worst villians in history (Hitler and Goebbels)?

By contrast, Frau Goebbels, who only hours earlier was anointed by der Fuhrer as ""Germany's best mother,"" drugs her five children with a potion and once they're incapicitated she kills them by breaking cyanade capsules into their mouths. These horrific acts are shared with us in their entirety.

It's troublesome. Lesser Nazis are seen blowing their brains out, so not showing Adolf or Josef doing so is a choice that sends a message, albeit not a loud one, to the viewer about the meaning of these figures to the German people, even in death.

That's the only issue I take with what is an extraordinary and often nerve-shattering film, one that otherwise constantly rings true and is in fact a must-see for military history buffs.",1263945600,2,1526,4.996062992125984
2151506,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is the story of the final days of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler.  The film is based on two books written by people who were in the bunker with Hitler and his staff.  It is a brilliantly crafted film, however it posits one nearly unthinkably theory.

Hitler was a human being.

Stunning as it is, I can find no evidence to support the fact that Hitler was an alien, cyborg, or an otherwise mythical creature from the bowels of hell.  He was a human being, filled with absolute hatred who gained the power to direct his hate outwards at the entire world.

But he was a human being.  This film alternates Hitler as he descends into his final moments.  We see the defiant leader, the hate filled genocidal maniac, the acceptance of the failure of the Reich, and then back through all three.  Interspersed we meet the other cast of people around him in his final days.  We see moments of vulnerability as the Goerbles children serenade ""Uncle Adolf"" on his birthday.  We see the sadness in his eyes when he poisons his dog shortly before ending his own life.  A sadness that never comes within a whisper of his face when he orders the extermination of MILLIONS of Europeans.

It is an odd juxtaposition to see Hitler as a kind, soft spoken man around the ""family"" in the bunker and the violent bouts of rage when the loss of the war is crashing down upon him.  Bruno Ganz does a flawless portrayal of the Fuerher in this film and his work should be acknowledged.

Anyway, this is a terrific film for anyone who wants to see inside the Reich.  I would love to see the creator of this film go back and make a HBO style mini series about the rise of the Nazi party.  I believe it would be important, and this crew would be able to take the story out of the basic textbook stage of ""Nazis are evil, let us hate at them.""  to a more productive ""A small group of people gained power in a ravaged nation and used fear and hatred in an attempt to take over the world and wipe races of people off of the earth.  While many in the power structure were pure evil, some were simply lazy and chose not to look at what they were doing and others were too slow witted to realize they were lock step with pure evil.""

You will not be disappointed by it; in fact, it is a DVD well-worth purchasing to view again. Also this film should have won the Best Foreign Film Academy Award -- it was a tragedy that it lost. Downfall is a superb film in every respect: the acting is brilliant, the settings are impeccably researched and exquisitely detailed, and the mood is perfect in tone -- melancholy and desperate. Hitler, as portrayed by the marvelous Mr. Ganz, is a moody, self-absorbed, shallow, and shattered politician who has reached the bitter end of his empty promises and knows this fact with a cruel urgency. He knows that he is doomed and that his Reich has crumbled into pieces like the rubble of the buildings destroyed by the Soviets. The film is shot so well and with such an intimate feel that you will think you are watching a documentary of the final hours of the crumbling German government.

2151511,5,B0002Z16HY,"Having become interested in WWII history after watching Valkyrie a friend recommended that I watch Downfall(DER UNTERGANG). I could not find it locally so I purchased this at Amazon. I have the DVD version since the Blu-ray is outrageously priced. That was disappointing since I have developed a passion for the 1080p productions. The DVD version is still a high quality film and the reproduction is very good. Most of the movie is dialogue and takes place inside Hitler's bunker in Berlin so do not expect this to be a cinematography masterpiece. I am not saying that the production is bad, it is just not intended to be beautiful. It is however realistic looking and the gravity of war is evident in the few outside shots that take place.
The storyline is taken from historical records including Joachim Fest's book, Inside Hitler's Bunker The Last Days of the Third Reich and BIS ZUR LETZTEN STUNDE by Traudl Junge.

2151519,5,B0002Z16HY,"Ultimately, Adolf Hitler met a cowardly and ignominious death - many of his allies and friends (e.g., Himmler and Gring) had fled the incoming Soviet invasion in efforts to save their own skins.  Hitler, refusing to leave, committed the almost-as-cowardly act of killing himself and leaving his subordinates saddled with the order to ""fight to the last bullet"" and ""leave Germany as an unlivable wasteland"".  This film tells the story of the last few days of Hitler's life, and in fact continues for a few days thereafter.  The action scenes are few and intermittent, and after having seen Saving Private Ryan, they are not particularly shocking.  What is shocking, at least to a North American viewer, is the utter dominance Hitler still had over the German people and its military leaders.  Many of them honestly believed that, even with Soviet artillery shells raining down on the centre of Berlin, Hitler would be able to pull off a miracle and save the Third Reich from destruction.  So convincing are the actors and so compelling is the story, that Hitler's famous movements of non-existent formations to the relief of Berlin  is not comedic or incredible, but oddly depressing and pathetic.

This is an all-German production (although, ironically, the exterior location shots were filmed in Saint Petersburg), and they make ample use of the memoirs and autobiographies of Hitler's contemporaries and employees, including interviews with those Nazis still alive at the time of pre-production.  Much was based on the book ""Hitler's Last Secretary"" (the English translation's title), in which Traudl Junge prints excerpts from a diary she wrote immediately after WWII ended.  Using the secretaries' points of view is a wise decision by the filmmakers, as they are outside the Party apparatus and are mainly viewing the madness around them, just as we are as movie watchers.  The filmmakers have made every effort to only show onscreen events that actually happened, and even went so far as to attempt to determine where Keitel, Jodl, Bormann, and the others stood during the Fhrer's war conferences.  Not only does this lend authenticity to the events, but (along with the superb acting of all the players) makes the film feel like a ""true"" depiction of what life was like in the Gtterdmmerung last days of the Third Reich.

A potential problem with the film for the average non-German viewer is that there appears to be no logical or even emotional reason for the generals to continue to obey and revere Hitler right up to the end.  The timeframe is too short to see Hitler's charismatic rise to power, his devotion to the German working-class who formed his power base (and their devotion to him), his near-perfect military record in the first 3 years of the war where he was repeatedly proven right and the Wehrmacht general staff officers proven wrong.  I would also have liked to have seen more emphasis on Bormann, the only other high-ranking Nazi official (along with Goebbels) who stayed with Hitler to the bitter end.  Where the film steps bravely, and I think importantly, is the celebrated (and condemned) portrayal of Hitler and the other high-end Nazis as human beings.  It is unquestionable that Hitler collected a number of synchophants and star-chasers around him, and that they might not have been particularly intellegent (his alienation of people like Guderian and Rommel is evidence that independent thinking was not tolerated in the Fhrerhauptquartier).  The only possible misstep is the promotion of a ""hero"" in the person of Col. Schenk, ""Inspector of Nutrition"" for the Waffen SS.  He apparently selflessly wishes to serve in Berlin to provide medical help to soldiers and civilians, but this is the same man who callously used slave labour at the Dachau concentration camp for nutritional experiments.

To summarize, this is a fascinating and engrossing look inside the final days of the Third Reich.  The performances are fantastic, and the film has an authenticity (even a ""truth"") that is rare and raises the film to a high level of importance.

Extras on this DVD edition supplement and add to the experience.  There are interviews with the authors of the books on which the film is primarily based, and also with the actors protraying the parts.  It is refreshing to see that all these actors took their parts very seriously and did extensive outside reading to ensure their performances were authentic.  The biggest kudos have to be reserved for Ganz (Hitler) and Harfouch (Frau Goebbels) who have the hardest people to portray, and somehow embody them as real people, not cartoon carricatures of teeth-gnashing villiany.",1250208000,2,4656,5.0549019607843135
2151520,5,B0002Z16HY,"This film is truly one of the best ever made about World War II. I was truly taken aback the first time I saw it by how great it was. This film really puts you in Adolf Hitler's bunker in Berlin in 1945 and that is not a place you would like to be. The film recreates war torn Berlin in great detail and the downfall of a regime is brought to vivid life. This film deserved to win a Oscar as Best Picture the year it was released. No movies that were nominated that year truly compare to it. It is one of the strongest entries into the World War II film genre.

Bruno Ganz pretty much becomes Adolf Hitler. I really have no idea how he did not at least get nominated for a Academy Award. In fact, he deserved to win it. He nails the famous rages but also the (few) quiet moments. Every time Ganz is on screen you are riveted. Almost all other Hitler portrayals in movies pale in comparison.  The other actors also do a fine job. The infamous gang is all here: Speer, Goebbels, Himmler. The actors really embody their roles no matter how small the part. The actor that plays the SS doctor does a very good job at his role. Frau Junge depiction brings her back to life and much of the film is seen from her perspective. The actress -Alexandra Maria Lara- does a very good job playing Hitler's secretary.

2151521,4,B0002Z16HY,"This is a very compelling movie that draws you in and keeps you riveted until the final unholy end of Hitler and Germany.  Bruno Ganz delivers the first true three-dimensional performance of Hitler.  Visually the claustrophobia of the bunker is felt by the viewer and one begins to feel the alternating moods of desperation and fantasy experienced by this group of rats about to be exterminated.
Ultimately the film can't answer all the questions we continue to crave answers for: how could Hitler happen?  How could a nation be led off the edge of a cliff by such an evil charletan?  Himmler, Borman, Goebbels et al were all mental cases.  But how did so many usually rational and sane people surrunder their minds to this evil necromancer.  The film can't answer all those questions but the story provides clues to the answers.
Hitler was a master chameleon who could be whatever his audience required, and exposed to only pie shaped wedges of Hitler one could be deceived.  But those who were part of the inner circle saw the real man: a deranged, ruthless savage.  But he was also a man who could in a moment or time be kindly or even endearing.  Hitler was a human being, not a demi-god or demon from another dimension.  To portray him as supernatural is to not realize the real danger which is that the beast lurks in all of us and can be summoned forth by the right kind of wizard.
The actress who plays Magda Goebbels is at turns mesmerizingly evil, weak, distraught and misguided.  Her performance is spellbinding.  I found this to be the finest, perhaps the definitive cinematic exploration of Hitler and his Gotterdammerung.",1248393600,2,1635,4.71830985915493
2151522,5,B0002Z16HY,"The wonderful treatment of history is the most amazing thing about this movie.  It delivers a truly authentic scenario of the final days of Hitler and his Third Reich.  The madness of the whole Nazi ideal is fully displayed and inspected in this amazing journey into the past, as told by Hitler's personal secretary.

I rank it with Schindler's List as among the best movies of Nazi Germany ever made.

Hitler's ultimate madness is wonderfully portrayed by Bruno Ganz, who was excellently selected to portray such a role.  His work was nearly perfect in this film.  It is as close a look into the warped and closed personality of the man who led the world to the brink of oblivion as one can ever get, I would imagine.  It's hard to put the movie into adequate words, for it must be experienced in order to truly be appreciated.  One does not simply explain why the movie is great.  One simply says it is and relies on the review reader to trust that it is great in good faith.

When the end is coming reason fully escapes the man and he sinks into his downfall, the end of all that was held together in the Third Reich.  When it is over for him there is an anti-climatic drama that unfolds as his secretary and others attempt to escape the wrath of the Red Army.  Even at the end many Nazis simply cannot willfully accept surrender as an option.

Then, there is the demise of Goebbels and his family, so terribly displayed.

The terrible nature of the intellectual infection of Adolf Hitler is incredibly reproduced here.  It is disgusting and repulsive.  Seeking an understanding of it all only leads one to the brink of madness themselves.

I recommend that no one under 17 years of age see this film.  But I recommend that everyone who is at least that age see this film at least once.  This is more than a movie.  It's an historical document for the ages.",1247961600,,1860,4.462908011869437

Mr. Ganz is Hitler throughout the film and explains to us all through his acting how the entire war began by displaying the personality and flaws of this sick and twisted historical figure and his minions.

This production is filled with historical accuracy and power.
The view of Hitlers Personal Secretary of these events lends more power and credence as to the thought processes and actions involved by all players.
Even supporting roles are excellent in their powerful portraits of subordinates.

2151526,5,B0002Z16HY,"The film opens with the fateful evening that Traudl Junge was hired by Hitler to be one of his personal secretaries. The film then moves to the last twelve days of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich. The movie in its depiction of that timeframe is much more graphic and realistic then the other three films: ""The Death of Adolf Hitler"", ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"" and ""The Bunker."" Events here are shown from different points of view. The portrayal of Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is the most balanced and least prone to dramatic effects. Most all of the major players are shown but, the portrayal of Bormann is too weak; furthermore, Dr. Morell and scenes of his ""treatments/injections"" of Hitler are missing.

SPOILER ALERT:
At the end of the film it shows Junge riding on a bicycle with the boy Peter away from Berlin (and assumed towards the west). However, in real life, (according to author James O'Donnell of 'The Bunker') Junge was raped by Russian soldiers before she was able to get out of Berlin. This was never mentioned by Junge herself in her autobiography (on which this film is largely based).

The film is 5 Stars overall. There is an extended version of this movie but it has not been released in Region 1 (the US and Canada) at the time of this review.

2151527,5,B0002Z16HY,"Das Boot is still my favorite war film, but Downfall is just as great. This  film, which deals with the last days of Hitler and the Reich, is something that we aren't really accustomed to these days. Like Das Boot, we get to see the German P.O.V. rather than the American/British/Russian, only here it is a bit more striking because it involves the notorious dictator himself. We get to see his ruthless paranoia and isolation as Russian forces are gaining victory around Berlin. We also get to see the people around him who start to see that Nazi Germany has been greatly defeated. It's a very disturbing experience, and once the end credits roll, we are left with awe and shock.

This is a fantastic foreign film that should've won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (or at least have a tie with The Sea Inside). Grade: A",1240099200,,820,4.533783783783784
2151528,5,B0002Z16HY,I first saw this movie in the theater a year or two ago. I was very impressed with it at that time. Then when the DVD came out on Amazon I decided that I needed to by it for my collection. It is the definitive record of the final days of Nazi Germany and Adolph Hitler. Even though Germany was our enemy and a criminal regime there were many people in Germany that were ordanary decent people. This movie really brings home the total tragedy of unrestricted warfare. The movie has great realism and the buildings and bunker make you feel you are in Berlin in April 1945 when the Downfall happened. It is in German but the English Subtitles are enough to make you understand what they say. Acting is supeb with all German actors and actresses. It is all based on the Diary of Hitler's secretary. Amazingly she just died a short time ago. A must for anyone interested in World History. The Special Features are almost as interesting as the movie.,1239408000,,944,4.431034482758621
2151529,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is very full portrait of the end of Hitler's regime.  Ganz (who is half-Jewish) is completely convincing as the declining, self-deluding, vicious Hitler.  You watch him as he loses touch with reality, first in ignoring reports that are not to his liking, then in placing ridiculous hopes in gambles and deus ex machina scenarios.  He seems quite human until he orders meaningless executions of the disloyal, who know the end is coming.

Most interesting, however, are the characters around him.  The story is told from the point of view of one of his secretaries, who states, perhaps disingenuously, that she was not a committed Nazi, but came to almost love Hitler the man - he earns her loyalty through kindness.  THere are also the Goebbels, whose wife and children come off as rather sympathetic, symbolic in many ways of the self-destructiveness of the German elite.  Deep in the bunker, they live in a kind of parallel universe, a mythological kingdom in which everything still seems possible.  Eva Brown works hard to keep everyone's spirits up in ironically frivolous dances while the guards are drinking themselves senseless.  Meanwhile, the Soviets are pressing closer and closer.

This is excellent historical drama, stimulating the viewer to want to discover more.  Warmly recommended.",1239321600,,1302,5.152380952380953

German with English subtitles I felt it probably captured the feel of the times more accurately than Hitler, the Last Ten Days, a movie I also liked. As seen from the point of view of Traudl, Hitler's secretary, the scenes leading to the Hitler's last moments run from the banal to the macabre. The immediate aftermath of the suicide, in which many of Hitler's inner circle began their escape and others also took their lives, is presented during the film.

2151532,5,B0002Z16HY,"What majestic movies have been coming from Germany lately. It is as only through  Art Germans can truly come to terms with their recent past of Nazism and Communism, beyond the silly smoke screen of chattering propaganda.

This is Greek tragedy,  - and I mean AEschylus, not Euripides. And truly beyond Good and Evil.

We know the end. We know what will happen to Berlin, to its people, to its women, as soon as the Russians will have their way. We know what awaits the children of the Goebbels. One of the girls even realizes it, adding to the horror. It is like one of those unbearable nightmares of which we are aware, and which nevertheless we want to dream till the end.

As for the best form of art, this is not imitation of life. ""Life is instead the imitation of something deeper, with which Art allows us to communicate"". And yet at the same time we are here conveyed the precise feeling that ""this is what it was"". We are reliving it: this is not a movie, is liturgy.

Bruno Ganz is of course incomparable.

Incidentally; some people are appalled to discover that Hitler was indeed a human being, kind to many, loved by his secretaries. Some has even complained that he is depicted as such. Truly, human stupidity is not finite.",1237939200,2,1238,4.5
2151533,5,B0002Z16HY,"It's mighty difficult to create a film where the main characters are responsible for some of the worst atrocities the world has ever seen.  It's even more gut wrenching to watch well intentioned people who think they are creating a better future for their country.

The propaganda and the zealotry of the children is possibly the worst, as you see kids brainwashed into fanatical devotion to the Third Reich, to the point where they kill themselves rather than surrender.  Also, the desperation tactics of hanging innocent civilians and Hitler's cold rebuttal that there are no innocents and Germany failed him spoke loads about the extent of the damage the Third Reich did upon Germany, to the extent that even today when someone thinks of Germany often-times the first thing to enter his mind is the Third Reich.

Hitler was shown human here, but was still almost absolute evil, blaming everyone but himself and creating a delusional world that bears no resemblance to his dire straits.

Goebbel and his wife, while not going into detail at their evil against the jews, show their derangement well enough with the murder of their own children.  Himmler, while his role being short, showed through well as the heartless exterminator he was.

The secretaries' statement at the end didn't strike me as plausible.  How could Hitler's personal secretary be completely oblivious to the slaughter of the Jews?  She at least somewhat blamed herself, but it seemed she was more guilty of knowing and doing nothing than she let on.

The only complaint is that they didn't subtitle the characters so the audience knew who they were.  This made it confusing to figure out which historical person they were supposed to be.

Overall, highly recommended for history buffs and anyone else.",1237507200,,1775,4.979661016949152
2151534,4,B0002Z16HY,"We usually associate ""downfall"" with Aristotle's ancient theory of tragedy in which he said the tragic protagonist is a human being of ""a certain magnitude"", but also ""like us"" in that he is human, who is essentially good and capable of greatness but who falls through a weakness in himself.  The ""magnitude"" part makes the tragedy more intense because it affects many people. Aristotle also said that there is no tragedy in the fall of an utter villain.  I prefer to think of Hitler as an utter villain, and I think this film is about the squalor and decadence of his rotted mind and the insanity of the people around him in his final days.  The non-Jewish Germans of that era bear a much greater responsibility for this diseased state of mind than they were willing to accept at the end of the war.  So, I would not have called the film ""Downfall""  because of the implication of tragedy.  There was no greatness, no potential for good in that cesspool.  The millions who suffered and died did not do so at the hands of a personally flawed great man who is essentially good.

Having said all that, I want to praise ""Downfall"" as successful insofar as the writing, directing, and acting are concerned.  But it should not be viewed as tragedy.  How can these diseased villains and the people who supported them fall down when there was never any ""up"" to fall from.",1235952000,2,1363,4.57201646090535
2151535,5,B0002Z16HY,"The Downfall describes the ten days leading up to Hitler's bunker suicide on April 30th, 1945. The tattered German Army surrendered a week later. It is the first significant film about Hitler made by a German film company. That Germans had to wait 60 years to confront their leader's demise is an indication of the enduring corrosiveness of the Hitler legend.

This is at least the third movie made of Trevor Roper's 1947 book The Last Days of Hitler, which started as a sensational British intelligence assessment of what happened to the Nazi leader.  As soon as the Soviets captured Berlin, they quickly spirited away the bodies of the bunker suicide group.  An extensive interrogation of all captured witnesses, captured dental records and an autopsy led to assurances that the Fhrer had not escaped.

The producers of The Downfall made a number of brilliant editorial decisions. The film explains nothing.  It shows in historically accurate detail what happened.  The viewer is witness to the many surreal vignettes played out in the charnel pit of Berlin in final days of WW-II.  With this essentially neutral portrayal of a man who alternates between being a kindly uncle and a raving lunatic, the usual cadre of critics who feel they alone own Hitler (it is much more than a cottage industry) are left speechless.

To add further complexity, one of the quiet heroes of the film is an SS medical officer.  This nuance will clash against the shibboleth that all SS men were only sadistic concentration camp guards instead of also the Swiss Guard of Hitler's megalomaniacal rule. Heavily indoctrinated, they were also the best-trained and fiercest combat troops of the European war--and often the most cruel.

The supporting women are expertly cast, particularly Eva Braun-more of a party girl than one imagines (and with a subtle nod to her possible affair with General Fegelein)--as well as Magda Goebbels.  Frau Goebbels is an icy beauty, as fascinating as the stare of a cobra.  Her methodical poisoning of their six children is one of the most sickening moments in film.

One criticism that can be made against the film is that too many of Hitler's generals are portrayed as reasonable men--professional soldiers, yet still honor-bound to a madman's captivating aura.  Yes, the German General Staff was comprised of classically educated men of a caliber that will never again lead a nation's military. But surely they were not all so resolutely noble, regal and handsome. OK, there were two fatties--Gring and Bormann--but they were mere window-dressing in this film and clearly as evil as they were corpulent.  Also, the bunker is depicted as being larger than the cramped, smelly redoubt it actually was. Dynamited by the Soviets a few years after the war it is now flooded and buried without any plaque noting its location.

Watching this gruesome story unfold is like traveling back to the Hitler bunker in a time machine.  It is shocking to witness the catastrophic violence of the death throes of Berlin. Death in the camps was a smoothly humming assembly line; death in Berlin was sudden and always capricious-a deafening cacophony of artillery shells, tank fire, collapsing buildings and the whistle and thud of small arms bullets. Fresh body parts litter this urban moonscape.

In the end, The Downfall comes closer than any film or book in portraying convincingly the dissolution of Hitler, the genius psychopath who was able to lead a nation-and himself--down a path of utter destruction.  Scenes of officer suicide in the face of Russian advances are realistically portrayed (and evoke echoes of Masada). And yet, still, Hitler's hold on the psyche of a nation is not fully understandable.  We see what happened; that his followers thought him truly a god.  But how--really--did that happen?  Could it happen to us?  Extraordinary as the film is in depicting the dying days of a once brilliant madman expiring in his lair, yet something more is needed to make us understand the ""why"" of it.  Perhaps, like all religious conversions, the reason for such a captivating thrall can never be understood. It can only be experienced.

2151537,5,B0002Z16HY,"I have read ""The Last 100 Days"", ""The Last Battle"", as well as other accounts of the last days of Hitler.  I had watched a couple of cinematic accounts of those final days and I generally came away with the sense that the films were excessive.  Admittedly, it's hard to be excessive about this subject but too many accounts seemed to want to shock rather than inform.  As numbing as ""Downfall"" is, I was most impressed by how comprehensive its' account seemed to be.  This was largely due, I felt, to the focus on such a wide range of individuals.  Certainly Hitler is the primary focal point but this isn't a movie that's just about him and his thugs.  There are real people trying to do a real job while surrounded by insanity and that aspect really drew me into ""Downfall"".  I have tried to understand what the collapse of Nazi Germany must have been like.  This movie gave me a sense of that Armageddon

This film runs about 2 1/2 hours but I never got the sense that it is a lengthy film.  I was engrossed throughout while simultaneously overwhelmed by a sense of shock at the scope of everything.  Frankly, I was surprized I had not previously heard about ""Downfall"".  It isn't for every audience but it struck me as being in a class by itself.

In fact, they followed his orders long after Hitler lost touch with reality, and long after the war was lost.

The film has been criticized for portraying its characters --some of whom were the top criminals in Hitler's regime-- sympathetically. But this criticism misses the point of the movie. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel set out to depict his characters not as stereotyped malevolent demons but, more chillingly, as what they were in real life: ordinary human beings blinded by a fanatical ideology and depraved by absolute power.

This is an amazing movie that does remain fairly historically accurate. The main criticism is that the movie humanizes Hitler a bit. But he was human, even if he was a sorge on humanity. I think this movie does not present a bias when telling the story of Hitler, and his close cronies, last days.

The following comments: ""The Russians soldiers raped 100's of thousands of German women. But some feel it was fully justified and deserved of a civilian poplulation which was as much to blame as the germany military."" ""The Germans said they did not know. Thats a bunch of hogwash. Off course everyone knew what was going on, they just tried to ignore it""

I'm not good at writng but wanted to respond to those statements. My great grandparents and grandparents told many stories about these events. The real short of it is yes many were naive and did NOT  know the extent what was occurring others knew and or were loyal anyway. You're lumping the ""loyal"" individuals to Hilter with ALL the people of Germany? Civillians are to attack the regime and overpower them? lol  ""Civilians"" or anyone would be executed if they would go against Hitler and were terrified as a result. Just a few details, as time and events slowly would unfold my grandmother went on a lunch date with a nazi and in german she said to the nazi ""Hitler is crazy"" he said ""Magdalena if I didn't like you as much as I do I would kill you where you stand"". She was shocked by his statement. They worked for wonderful jewish people they considered great friends later discovered nazi's hatred against the jews. They tried to sneak them food which nearly got them killed. Trying to flee the country to get to the US, crossing the borders, hiding under dead bodies, nearly got them killed. Nazis took their german relatives/friends away to dig their own graves and buried alive because they were against Hitler. So I don't know how much you think familes can do unarmed, mostly poor as they were. I'm sure there are many different accounts, but don't lump a situation and think that everyone falls into it that is naive in itself. As a result the way some view Germany believe it deserved that thousands German women were raped By russians? What kind of solgiers were they evil just the same.. Seems you think that's justified too the way you put it and what you wrote. My grandfather rode 1000 miles on a bike to prevent that from happening to my dear grandmother (rape by russian solgiers) and only lived through it because he knew the russian language otherwise he would have been killed before he could get to her. When they made it to the US was a miracle, they experienced  their own horrors due to Hilter and his regime and didn't realize  to the level that millions of jewish people died and suffored until they made it to this country, and even so the country divided according to them could do little about it, many already thought him insane in spite of that. Anyway to think rape is justified. Yep sounds logical, seems we're not much better today in our thinking.. Obviously there were enough to get him into power, brainwashed, sick indviduals and few that had no choice. Goes back to biblical times, very sadly nothing new and exists to levels even today. Point is Vikram even if it IS as cut and dry as you suggest and all people of Germany are like robots, fully knew, could do something about it yet did nothing..,again it doesn't justify rape.",1227484800,,3187,4.59402460456942

Major pluses include the boldly dispassionate approach- humanizing historical figures who aren't generally seen as human; the non-hysterical examination of a highly emotional subject; the great historical accuracy and attention to detail, and perhaps most of all, the showcase of excellent performances, beginning with the phenomenal work of Bruno Ganz as Hitler.

A minus is the slight self-consciousness of it all, which may not have been avoidable. Hitler's descent into delusion, which was complete before the events of this film, is often met here by other characters- his rabid followers- with nervous glances and raised eyebrows (implying ""My God, he's lost it!"") that almost amount to a breach of the fourth wall. The Fuhrer's anti-Semitic tirades seem to provoke the same sort of nervous indulgence, which simply isn't believable. Even at the end, Hitler was not the funny uncle he seems to be greeted as- in just a few places- here. These people were all still in that boat with him in 1945, and still rowing.  (Some of his Generals were a notable exception, as depicted, but I refer to the inner circle).

Again, it's understandable if this German film occasionally carries a note of unspoken apology, but I think the aim was slightly higher than the realization in that regard. In fact, the central issue of collective guilt isn't really resolved here at all. Perhaps it can't be, or shouldn't be, as none of these characters were in a position to really question themselves within the film's boundaries: April and early May of 1945.

In terms of direction, the idea of keeping things mainly in the eye-level point of view of a few everyman characters is also a valid one, but it costs the film some power.  Hitler's death, for example, is not explicitly shown, but feels like it needed to be.

The tension that should result from such a claustrophobic and stifling environment, with death closing in from every direction, could have been heightened considerably.  The lost opportunities in direction and editing are filled by the amazing story itself, wonderful performances, and the perceptible passion and integrity that attended this production at every level.

2151549,4,B0002Z16HY,"n the annals of film, the greatest screen portrayal of an evil world leader was undoubtedly Anthony Hopkins' 1995 turn as President Richard M. Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. Within five to ten minutes of one's first glimpse of Hopkins- a Brit who looked and sounded nothing like the 37th American President, one almost forgets what the real Nixon looked like. But, now there's a contender who could knock Hopkins off his perch- or at least give him a good fight, and that is Bruno Ganz's turn as Adolf Hitler in the 2004 Academy Award nominated Best Foreign Language Film from Germany, Downfall (Der Untergang- literally The Downfall). What makes this all the more remarkable is that- unlike Nixon, many actors have tried and failed to get into Hitler's skin, including the aforementioned Hopkins, who took on the role in The Bunker (1981). In fact, Ganz is so great at portraying Hitler- and he looks far more like the real Hitler than Hopkins did Nixon, even sans the Chaplinesque mustache and combover, that the film took much criticism for portraying Hitler as a real live human being. Heaven forfend that art contain some reality, or `truth,' as the PC Elitists claim! Ganz is brilliant- from his wild veering between depression and rages, to his jittery nervousness, and a shaking of his hands which, when held behind his body, seem to devolve almost into the claw of a wounded raptor, grasping for anything to steady his older than he looks fifty-six year old form. In fact, Ganz seems to age and literally shrink in size, as he stoops and hunches, with each succeeding scene. Yet, it's the moments of tenderness Hitler shows his fiance/wife, Eva Braun, his wounded indignation at perceived betrayals, and his timidity toward women, as well as impeccable manners, that really offends the PC. This ability to move a viewer is, of course, the manifestation of the great art of a great artist.
  Many big name critics, around the world, though, took the film to task for the most asinine of reasons. The New Yorker's David Denby, a minor thinker, wrote: `As a piece of acting, Ganz's work is not just astounding, it's actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use....We get the point: Hitler was not a supernatural being; he was common clay raised to power by the desire of his followers. But is this observation a sufficient response to what Hitler actually did?' This incredibly idiotic statement, and many other PC comments like it, about film and art in general, are the very reasons I took to writing film criticism. What response could possibly be sufficient to the genocidal crimes of a Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, or King Leopold?.... All in all, Downfall is a movie worth seeing, but it is not one that is `required viewing'- neither for its art nor its historical value. It rises and falls almost solely on Ganz's shoulders. To me, the most affecting moments within come when Hitler willfully denies the reality of his nation's Gtterdammerung, and pretends that this or that general will save the day with a brilliant maneuver, at the last moment, to cut off the Russians, and save the war effort. Anyone watching the recent change of American military leadership in Iraq is familiar with their nation's leader's utter refusal to face stubborn facts, and it's a scary scene- whether or not that leader is a mass murdering psychotic, or merely a clueless frat boy with a God complex. Yet, like many of the other `historical' facts, this intermittent self-delusion is also considered, by most historians, untrue. Hitler is known to have commented after being repulsed at Stalingrad, and also after losing The Battle Of The Bulge, that he knew that an eventual German defeat was unavoidable. These are two more wasted opportunities to core into the man, and these ill wrought fictions- be they of whole characters or scenes with real personages, are ultimately what kill the screenplay. As a side note, it's worth realizing the fact that the Second World War, despite its horrors and nonpareil bodycount, can now be thought of as the last real war `played by the rules' says much of our species.
  That Downfall can succeed as a film, despite some bad acting, and a weak screenplay, also says much for the notion that a single great performance, as well as a historically significant and dramatic enough moment, can overcome abundant mediocrity more easily than a work of fiction can. Bruno Ganz is now the definitive film Hitler, but the definitive portrayal of his true downfall has yet to be made.

The uniforms, weapons, buildings, all authentic. You feel as if you are there in wartime Germany. Ironically, many of the street scenes were filmed in St. Petersburg, Russia. The acting is on a level rarely seen anywhere. Bruno Ganz makes you forget that you are watching an actor and simply puts Hitler before you as a believable person rather than as a caricature or stereotype.

Now to be fair I love movies of this genre but if this was half as good I would still have loved it. My wife hates these type of movies however and it took a lot of convincing to get her to watch the next night. She hates war moves and really hates movies with subtitles.

I think it was the human depiction of the characters that made it so good. I defiantly did not feel sorry for Hitler after watching this however the lower rank soldiers and civilians were much easier to have sympathy for. I believe the tone of the movie highlighted how easily normal people can fall in line behind a mad man who in better times might have seemed more like a savior and then suffer terrible consequences for their blindness.

2. It makes you more interested in the subject matter.

There have been so many movies that end at the credits and you don't give them a second thought. Downfall is not one of those movies, at least not for me. I felt like an eye-witness to the last days of Hitler.

And the criticisms for the movie are unwarranted and expected in a politically correct society. The movie portrays Hitler as a human. Really? What was he in reality, an alien? Of course he was human. But I felt no more sympathy for him after this movie than I did before. The same for Goebbels, etc. It made me aware that as humans, these people made grave mistakes in their decisions and paid for it. Let that be a lesson to those who are doomed to repeat it.

I've also heard some criticize the fact that it was not in English. I'm embarrassed that people make such silly claims. Would it really feel authentic if the actors had and English accent?  Come on.

2151559,5,B0002Z16HY,"I understand that this powerful film has garnered many accolades and much controversy. Much of the controversy centers around the Nazis actually being portrayed as human. Critics of this film should realize that, in their most desperate hour, everyone -- even monsters -- can feel all those sentiments that all people share. In Hitler's case, he is trapped in his bunker and seeing everything he created, all his ambitious, superman dreams, fall into oblivion. Bruno Ganz turns in a tour de force performance as he presents Hitler's despair and desperation as he knows his end is approaching. Yet, he holds onto faint hope that somehow there will be some divine intervention that if confirm his mastery over the world. And there are the others, those who followed him, even they cannot escape that which makes them human. They cling to their sense of duty and honor to remain grounded. In the powerful scene, where Corinna Harfouch as Frau Gobbels poisons her children, she moves from dutiful Aryan mother, to disgust at the act she has just committed. Then, on the turn of a dime, she restores her sense of duty and plays a game of solitaire. Truly a heart-wrenching moment. And there are many moments like that through this movie, where individuals struggle with their blind devotion to duty and their need to protect that little bit that still makes them human. At the end of the film, the last word is left to Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge. She admits to, at one time, convincing herself that she was uninvolved in all the horrors the Nazis unleashed. But later in life, she suddenly realized she being young and naive is no excuse to separate one  from those horrors. For me, her message is clear: In the end, the Nazis were human and, like all humans, we share common bonds with them. Chew on that one for a while.",1217289600,2,1823,4.732704402515723
2151560,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a fantastic film, and a testimony that truly great filmmakers can achieve a lot with very little.

After 3 days, it's still wedged firmly in my memory, and will haunt me likely till the day I die. It astounded me just how deluded and fanatical some of these people were, until the very end. I don't know about others, but this is what resonated most strongly with me in regards to this film; that one can be so devoted to an idea, so taken with it and unwilling to accept defeat, that they would give and sacrifice absolutely everything to that idea. It's even more astounding given that Hitler's vision of the world was as far from just or benevolent as could get. I daresay this is probably one of the best war dramas you'll ever see, made so by great direction, near-perfect editing, and a fantastic cast. Don't miss it!",1217030400,2,1017,4.386243386243386

Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler was astounding. He received criticism for portraying Hitler as a human. Regardless of your opinion of Bruno's interpretation of the character, his portrayal was convincing. One of the most powerful performances was by Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels. What a cowardly, sinister creature. Matthes captured that inhumanity so well.",1216425600,2,673,5.017857142857143
2151562,5,B0002Z16HY,"This film alone makes worthwhile all the work it took to learn fluent German.  The subtitles are probably about as good as what I could have done, but subtitles and dubbing never quite convey all that is in the original script language.  ""Sie werden ersaufen in ihrem eigenen Blut!"" is translated as ""They will drown in their own blood!""  The script departed from the usual German word order that parks most verbs (after the first) on the end of the sentence, thus: ""Sie werden in ihrem eigenen Blut ersaufen!""  This might have been because it underscores Hitler's well-known mastery of squeezing every bit of feeling from his listeners -- he ends the sentence not with the three-syllable word for ""drown"" but with the potent monosyllable ""BLOOD!""  Hitler's gift for expression is also manifest in ""Ersaufen"" instead of the usual ""ertrinken"" for ""drown.""  ""Ersaufen"" is a vulgar or less polite way of saying ""ertrinken,"" akin to the better-known replacement of the more polite ""essen"" for ""eat"" with ""fressen"" to describe how animals eat, perhaps the equivalent of ""gobble up"" or ""wolf down.""  Instead of ""trinken"" for ""drink,"" ""saufen"" is more like ""guzzle.""  German, in its agglutinative way, then tacks ""er-"" on the front to indicate that the action leads to death, so ""ertrinken"" means ""drown"" and ""ersaufen"" is to drown disgustingly or wretchedly.  Of course, translators of movie scripts can't get sidetracked into such linguistic intricacy, so  ""They will drown in their own blood!"" is the only reasonable subtitle here, but it does leave out something underscoring that Hitler's facility with language was with him until the end.

Some of the actors besides Ganz also looked a great deal like the actual characters they played: Goebbels (except that the actor was quite a bit taller than the actual Goebbels -- whom the Germans called ""Giftzwerg"" -- poisonous dwarf), Himmler, Speer, Bormann, and Keitel -- Gring less so.  However, the ramrod-straight and slender Jodl would not have recognized himself in this film.  This was perhaps okay with less well-known characters such as Krebs and Burgdorf, but one of my few (and very minor) quibbles with this film is that it might have worked harder to depict Jodl. The actresses playing Eva Braun and Traudl Junge were the right size and wore the correct clothes, but weren't as recognizable, judging from much surviving color footage of both. ""Downfall"" also contains narrative scenes with Traudl Junge taken just before her death.

To see extensive interviews done 35 years ago with Speer (crafty enough to get only a 20-year sentence at  Nrnberg instead the neck-stretching accorded to Jodl and Keitel, who didn't shoot themselves as did Krebs and Burgdorf), and especially with a much younger Traudl Junge, and others who recalled the final days in the Fhrerbunker, get or rent ""The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition) (1974),"" quite a bargain for 22 hours of video that combines well with ""Downfall"" in helping understand the events, if it is possible to begin to understand a world gone mad, especially this country gone mad.

In general, ""Downfall"" depicts actual events as reported by surviving bunker occupants very closely, except for the final sequence showing Traudl Junge with an orphaned boy, a composite of an actual child tank-buster decorated by Hitler and a fictional character.  Why not just show Frau Junge and the two other secretaries leaving Berlin, as was the actual case?

Incidentally, in all of Hitler's ravings in this film, other than nuances such as using ""ersaufen"" instead of ""ertrinken,"" Hitler never uses profanity or obscenities, unlike the pungent script alterations in the many YouTube parodies of the scene when Hitler blows his top upon learning that the war is lost.  At one point, someone asks ""What do you expect from a non-smoking vegetarian teetotaler?""  Hitler and the Nazis tried to promote a healthy lifestyle, and it was in reaction to associations with Nazism that Germany (with the help of a few well-placed research funding incentives from US tobacco companies) has been one of the last European countries to begin to enact laws against smoking in restaurants and public buildings, with one of the highest rates of smoking among women in the world.

I must especially underscore one reviewer's remarks that seeing the sympathetic side of Hitler (Traudl Junge once said that of all the bosses she had in her life, he was the kindest to her) somehow emphasizes the horror in the man and the movement.  As Jacob Bronowski says in the ""Ascent of Man"" sequence where he sifts through his fingers Auschwitz dust that might contain particles of his close relatives, this is what comes of thinking your way is the only way.",1215907200,5,4724,5.029487179487179
2151563,5,B0002Z16HY,"Some people in Germany have accused this movie of attempting to ""make harmless"" the crimes of the Third Reich.  This couldn't be further from the truth, and I'll explain why.

Bruno Ganz plays Hitler the man.  Hitler the man who loves his dog, who is nice to his secretary, who loves his friends and spits at the people he thinks betray him, who tells those he cares about to save themselves even as he prepares to take cyanide, shoot himself, and then be burnt.  This is a guy who, as long as he's not talking about the Jews or world domination, wouldn't be that hard to live with.

HOWEVER, this is still Hitler the monster.  Being a vegetarian doesn't absolve him of being directly responsible for the deaths of millions or for throwing the entire world into war.  Hitler the two-dimensional monster is inseparable from Hitler the three-dimensional man, and that is what this movie reminds us every time it makes you feel sorry for him even though you know, and the movie reminds you, that he was a monster.

All monsters in history--past, present, and future--were and are and will be human beings.  We like to imagine Hitler as being some sort of inhuman monster, but he was only human.  Far too human.  That is why this movie makes people uncomfortable; it reminds them that any 'gee he seems like a nice fellow' leader of men could turn out to be a monster if the right questions are never asked or the ideas never challenged.  The warning is an uncomfortable one: you cannot trust any ideologue on face value.

Not a single one, ever.

And /that/ is the real import of this movie, if ""Never Again"" is to have any sort of real meaning beside a catchphrase.  Were I a history teacher, I would show this movie followed by /Schindler's List/.

Germany alone did everything and then there was ""Der Untergang"" ... Stunning storyline, sometimes or better known as history. Sigh. There's so much more to learn in life than how shoes lose their souls or soles, whichever you prefer.

I love the way the soldies, german soldiers, have an attitude of nonchalance as if nothing can possibly go wrong and they go about taking orders like they always have. So used to drudgening every possible enemy. I like that side of them. I like that side of humanity.

Downfall is a good film. I thought it would have ended when Hitler gives away. Rather than showing what happened to individual characters, if I was the director, I'd show what happened to the world than these few character names I would forget in a hurry.

2151565,5,B0002Z16HY,"Oliver Hirschbiegel ""Downfall"" is one of the most best written, directed, and acted films I've ever seen.  It's also one of the most disturbing.  Prefaced and concluded by excerpts from an actual interview with Trudl Junge, a young Bavarian woman who joined Hitler's secretarial pool in late 1942 and who was in the Fuhrerbunker when he killed himself, the film focuses on the last ten days of Hitler's life.

All of the characters one would expect to see in such a story are present.  But Hirschbiegel and screenwriter Bernd Eichinger break away from the stereotypes of them as evil incarnate to present them as complexly tragic figures too.  None of the key figures are morally exonerated; they come across all too often as truly brutal creatures who deserve the strongest condemnation.  But we also see them as creatures who exhibit vestiges of humanity:  Bruno Ganz's Hitler can be distantly caring in private even though a monster when in his role as leader; Magda Goebbels is a Nazi fanatic, but one can't help feel a bit of compassion for her mixed with revulsion when she poisons her children (the scene when the eldest daughter resists the ""medicine"" is heartbreaking); Eva Braun's inability to quite grasp what's happening, a characteristic of her shallow personality as much as the confusion of the final days, is both horrifying and infuriating, but also somehow touching.  In short, the characters breathe, and help the viewer to go beyond one-dimensional stereotypes.  Moreover, the film gives a good and chilling impression of the anarchy that broke out in Berlin as the Russian Army closed in:  zealous diehard Nazis executing civilian Berliners in last-ditch attempts at ""order""; children impressed into the Home Guard; ragged and starving civilians scrambling for a tin of food; SS officers committing suicide rather than surrendering; and ordinary soldiers, stripped of hope, drinking themselves into oblivion.  The lessons are plain:  war doesn't end neatly and cleanly.  The evil wrought by warmakers such as Hitler doesn't die with them.

The visuals of the film are also superb.  The Fuhrerbunker is stark, straight-lined, monochromatic, but also decorated with the occasional tacky bourgeois knicknack loved by Hitler.  The blasted Berlin streets are desolating to see.  The crowded underground scenes make one claustrophic.

In the interview at the film's end, Traudl Junge says that until a certain point in her post-war life, she was unable to see herself as in any way personally implicated in the horrors wrought by Hitler.  She was, after all, just a secretary.  But then one day she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl, the schoolgirl executed before the war for her ""White Rose"" resistance to the Nazis.  Junge realized with a shock that Sophie and she were born in the same year.  Then, Junge tells us, it came to her: even youth is no excuse--""ist keine Entschuldigen""--for either active collaboration or nonresistance to evil.

Films have been made of this subject before but this German version is unusual for its realism. Rather than portray Hitler as a cartoon nemesis type, he is portrayed as a real, if not very human, person whose life has been brought to this insane end by his own idiocies.

But the film is much more about the nuttiness of his peewit followers and admirers who fawn over him and maintain their belief in him even as their world is going to hell all around them. The film concentrates on one of the less offensive of these: Gertrude ""Traudl"" Junge, one of his secretaries. Pretty and personable, she tries to maintain her faith despite the surrealism of the bunker.

This film is hard to watch. The worst of Hitler's underground menagerie is Dr Goebbels and his handsome but lunatic wife. Goebbels, in one of his rare diversions into humor, once said that it was fortunate that his children
took after himself for brains and his wife for looks. It was true. The Dr was a foul looking little creep of a man, but his children (I have seen pictures of them) were beautiful. Goebbels and his wife poisoned their children in the bunker shortly after Hitler committed suicide so that they would not grow up in Germany without Nazism. This
act of infanticide is brutally shown in the film. It is a painful scene.

The film is well made. A warning: it is entirely in German with English subtitles, no dubbing.",1208736000,3,1489,4.590225563909774
2151570,5,B0002Z16HY,"I'm bemused by the criticism of this film based on the fact that it depicts the Nazi leadership as human beings. To me, that renders the horror more acutely and forces us to address, squarely, the question of how individuals can depersonalize others to the extent that they can rejoice at the concept of mass murder & extermination? In fact, I found that this film helped me comprehend a small part of that by portraying the culture of death that surrounded Hitler, Goebbels and the inside elite. The beliefs and actions they accepted as a normal part of human life -- and the fact that they did accept these as normal and even desireable -- is far more damning than a more conventional Holocaust drama. (After all, didn't serial killer Ted Bundy appear on the outside to be a polite, charming guy? The true horror lies in the idea that someone can commit horrific murders and calmly go grocery shopping -- it forces us to recognize that evil does not always look like the bogeyman.) The scene in which Magda Goebbels kills her children -- forcing her eldest daughter to bite down on the cyanide capsule -- demonstrates more powerfully than any other single filmed scene exactly how evil these individuals were. This is not a film for those who want easy answers about human nature. It challenges the viewer to ponder the apparent ease with events can snowball and lead to horrific evil, as well as force us to question how individuals could do this. It doesn't need an emphasis on anti-Semitism to deliver a powerful wallop. Rather, the film triumphs because it shows how Hitler's political philosophy negated humanity itself, a vast and horrifying concept. I watched this film when it first appeared on DVD and have yet to forget it. For those of us aware of the war and the Holocaust only through the stories of our elders, the acting, script, cinematography etc. brings the full horror to life. If you're looking for a comparable book, I'd suggest Gitta Sereny's examination of Albert Speer.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Albert-Speer-His-Battle-with-Truth/dp/0679768122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth</a>",1208563200,6,2186,5.16056338028169
2151571,5,B0002Z16HY,"This film is a truly amazing piece of work. Historically well researched, all of the major players are present and play their part in these, the last days of the Reich, as are all of the emotions one would anticipate as the armies of Stalin close in on the once proud city of Berlin.

As the battle rages closer and closer to the heart of Berlin, Hitler (and the residents of Berlin) react with delusional detachment. Hitler insists to his sycophants in the bunker that this invasion so deep into the capital of the Reich is all a ploy - a decoy for a final assault by the German armies that will break the back of the Russians and turn the tide of the war. The architects of the Reich - Himmler, Speer, Fegelein, Hess (offstage) and others - realize the futility of the situation and begin to rapidly maneuver to save their skins (Himmler even asks Fegelein whether he should give Roosevelt the Nazi salute or shake his hand as he tenders Germany's surrender), while the personal staff of Hitler and the citizenry of Berlin descend into a surreal, macabre festivity (as Trudl Junge, played to nave perfection by Alexandra Maria Lara, says ""it's like a dream, which you cannot escape, which never ends""). As the situation's genuine hopelessness becomes overwhelmingly apparent, the residents of the bunker begin to casually discuss the best means of suicide over dinner, again adding to the surreal air of the portrayal. Frau Goebbels' insistence that her children ""cannot conceivably grow up in a world without National Socialism"" rings similar of other more modern political and ideological sound bites and her depraved subsequent acts look similar to several other cinematographical events presented in a more heroic light.

What truly forces this film out of the crowd of other films dealing with Hitler and the fall of the Reich is its portrayal of the various Nazi participants as human beings, rather than diabolical or demonic entities of evil incarnate. I've always felt that portrayal of Hitler and his cronies as slavering maniacs (Hitler - The Rise of Evil, with Robert Carlyle, is the worst of the lot) and the German soldiers under their command as mindless automatons who shoot wherever they point does history a tremendous disservice. Portraying them as ""fantasy/horror"" villains of obvious evil demeans and diminishes the historical lesson to be learned, and implies that such characters are easily recognizable. Having lived abroad for the last 14 years, I've never been able to accept that the well-educated German people elected and supported a slavering lunatic - spittle smearing maniacs have a tough time appealing to the general populace, particularly an astute one. In a culture where ""humanizing"" Hitler is something to apologize for, it's easy to forget that Hitler was, in fact, just that - human - not some fantasyland villain or monster.

Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolph Hitler is almost grandfatherly, a seemingly benevolent man whose hands shake from palsy (the later stages of syphilis) but who addresses his troops and supporters on a first name basis and constantly exudes charm, wit and charisma (at least in the early moments of the film). Here lies the true message and the most important aspect of the film - these men were monsters, but they were human monsters, coupled with minds and visions much greater than the average. Despicable and evil, but, at the same time, great and inspiring. Unlike Carlyle's portrayal of Hitler in Rise of Evil, or Spielberg's/Schindler's List's Amon Goeth (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes), these monsters could pass you on the street and you wouldn't look twice. You'd invite them into your home, perhaps even support them if you did not have history to put them into context. Bruno Ganz's Hitler isn't a man who woke up every morning wringing his hands and sneering villainously, looking forward to doing ""evil"" during the day. He was committed to a cause and vision, albeit a twisted and corrupt one, who managed to capture the emotions of one of the most well educated countries in the world. As both Hitler and Goebbels remark during the film ""The (German) people gave us a mandate. They supported what we have done. I do not pity them for what is to come."" The old adage of ""Never again!"" has to be reviewed in this context. Have states and peoples subsequently been led to do evil by their leaders on the basis of emotion and collective hysteria? If so, will they again?",1207699200,2,4446,4.893899204244032

2151574,5,B0002Z16HY,"DOWNFALL is by turns bloody, horrifying, infuriating, claustrophobic, pathetic, and frightening.  And almost always fascinating as it pans across the parade of humanity - the famous, the powerful, and the obscure - in the final days of the Third Reich in Berlin. Allied bombs are pounding the city.  The Russians are fast approaching.

Hitler, the omnipotent Fuhrer, is down in his bunker below Berlin, and disintegrating into madness before the stunned faces of his senior staff and generals.  His girlfriend Eva Braun - who seems at best a few sandwiches short of a picnic - is determined to put on her party clothes and dance; but the party is literally blasted back down into the bunker just when it's going strong.

Military men sit in the bunker and get drunk.  Hitler's young secretaries wonder what will happen next.

Out in the streets the Nazi troops are aided by idealistic youth and the generals are stymied by the Fuhrer's deluded orders - based on reinforcements which are figments of his fevered imagination.  A military doctor defies orders to vacate, and we are never spared for long the sights and sounds of the wounded.

There is little daylight in this film.  There are few moments of quiet and peace.  The Reich, the civilization as the Nazis remade it, is crumbling along with the city itself.  Old scores are settled with violence.

In counterpoint to the blood-soaked streets, we see Goebbels' wife bring their children into the bunker.  The cute blonde Aryan bunch sings a happy song for their Fuhrer.  And ultimately are drugged to sleep and ruthlessly killed by their mother.  The first, but not the last, homicides and suicides in the bunker.

It is the bitter end of war, the fall of a regime, and the plunge of a city into deep chaos.  It is a downfall to remember.  Not an easy film to watch, but well acted, gritty, persistently grim, and definitely worth viewing.",1206403200,2,1896,4.796296296296297

A very powerful movie showing the end days of Nazi Germany. It is well acted and shows the different types of people around Hitler apart from Hitler himself. One gets a real sense of what it must have been like in the bunker in the dying days of the war, as it became clearer and clearer for the characters portrayed that the Nazis had lost the war. Some of characters were clearly pathological deviants without question. Others were true believers and followers, who allowed evil to happen as they so much wanted to believe the illusion they were fed, while ignoring the reality and the brutality that was all too obvious for those with eyes to see.

Lessons to be learnt in today's world, where a new rise of fascism is evident. Time to watch out and pay attention to what is really happened and done and not just to what the leaders say.",1206144000,,850,4.47741935483871
2151576,5,B0002Z16HY,"World War II movies have usually entertained me, though a vast majority of them have been relegated to the same dull ""Saving Private Ryan""/""Band of Brothers"" pro-America, screw everyone else storytelling.  That's not to say Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is bad, simply that they break no new ground.  They are entertaining, but they are hardly one of a kind.

Then came Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" which captivated me with its utterly human portrayal of virtually every level of Japanese military command on Iwo Jima.

And so I came to Downfall, which has been lauded for its well-rounded portrayal of Hitler, and criticized for its supposed ""heroicizing"" of some higher-ranking Nazis responsible for horrible war crimes.

Thankfully the film is German, so it is naturally in German, and well-known Hollywood stars aren't around to be a distraction from the content.

Bruno Ganz is almost frightening in how he can make Hitler a real person, from a brief prelude in 1942 which clearly portrays the man who held an entire nation captivated, to the broken shell barely hanging on to his ambitions, his struggles, and his sanity two and a half years later.  His genial nature to the main character, Traudl Junge is almost frightening when you remember this is the same man who nearly destroyed Europe, was responsible for the killing of tens of millions of Russian soldiers, millions of western Europeans, and ten million civilians with the ""Final Solution"".  And so easily he can turn on the fits of rage and shouting that could melt even the most spartan of military officers.

I do agree that some of the high-ranking Nazis are treated almost like heroes, but I think this speaks volumes about the kinds of people who would perpetrate such crimes as the Holocaust; normal people, with virtue and vice, sticking to an ideal and blinding themselves to a reality, or otherwise accepting the reality as furthering the ideal.

Every character is portrayed as more than a grotesque caricature of evil, hatred, and rage, given personality, even down to the stone cold zealot Goebbels, whose unwavering devotion to Nazi Germany is no detraction from his humanity, as he mourns the loss of his children, genuinely believing the future to be not worth living in without the Third Reich.

There is no propaganda to this film:  Hitler is human, yes, but that does not make him right or his actions forgiveable.  Bruno Ganz as Hitler is warm, gentle, and witty, and he is stubborn, heartless, and deranged.  The Soviets are the greatest threat Germany faces in these last days of the war---as they were for most of the ground battles in the war.

Somewhat foolishly enough, my only complaint with the film is that every explosion is accompanied by the exact same sound effect of twisting metal.",1205107200,,2804,4.911016949152542

A finely crafted piece of filmmaking, with stunning performances throughout, never before have I seen an account of WWII that is so vibrantly horrifying.  The portrait of Hitler is particularly mesmerizing - the account rendered in this film paints the picture of a wildly maniacal sociopath with human touches - even traces of warmth.  This juxtaposition was, for me, a powerful one, and offered perhaps the first ever film biography of the most notorious killer of modern history that feels believable. And this film captures Eva Braun with a raw intensity - you actually have a sense of who she might have been.  And the loyalty of Hitler's henchmen - and his countrymen - is painted as so complete that it underscores the audacity of what this man actually did to the world.  A first-class, exceptional film that will have you riveted.  Beware - there are multiple scenes of graphic violence, not to mention ghastly atrocities that are so specific and personal that, in some ways, they are worse than the mass murders we've seen portrayed in other WWII films.",1204934400,,1202,4.839024390243902

2151583,5,B0002Z16HY,"For civilized people, the murderous repugnancy of the Third Reich tends to make one want to look away whenever this evil chapter in human history is opened. Never the less, it is a chapter, and if anything is going to be gained by opening it, it is imperative that the depravity and perversion be illuminated in the non-judgemental light of accuracy. This is what the German film ""Der Untergang"" (Downfall) does.

As a screenplay, ""Der Untergang"" is a tragedy only because most of the primary characters commit suicide. It is a reminder that victory for one country is defeat for another. While one society is jubilant, another society, along with it's people, suffers and perishes. Just as the film begins with Traudl Junge's hiring as a secretary, it ends with her escape as a refugee. Thankfully, the curtain closes with a metaphorical ray of hope towards the return of civilization for a people who were deprived of it for over a decade.

As a film, ""Der Untergang"" knows few peers. It is a deviant and pathological ""Band of Brothers"". I could not help but be reminded of the World Trade Center as I watched papers flutter to the ground outside the Reich Chancellery. The imagery may have been unintentional, but it was an irrevocable and unwanted visual association, regardless. The result was profound introspection. ""Der Untergang"" portrays the absolute savage debauchery of war while attempting to illuminate with historical accuracy the mystery of what occurred in the Fhrerbunker beneath Berlin. In many ways, it is a purging of a poisonous bile for the German people. It blitzkrieged to the top of the German box office. Almost half a million tickets were sold in its opening weekend. It pulled in 480,000 viewers in its first four days despite poor reviews. It was the catharsis the German people had been long denied.

As a United States released DVD, ""Downfall"" has a few problems. Characters who may be quickly recognized by Germans are not so easily recognized by people in the United States. Many of the generals and other uniformed cronies are nameless and appear the same. It is only later in the film that the identities of critical people are realized. It would have been very helpful and informative had the DVD contained a visual primer for the uninitiated. Perhaps a special features menu with simple photos of the characters and a historical description of their place in the Nazi regime.

Obviously, the film is in the German language. Subtitles are provided. They are, however, rather diminutive on the small screen, and they flash by rapidly to keep pace with the dialogue. As a result, I found myself pausing the DVD to read them. After I paused to keep up with the dialogue, my wife wanted to examine the architecture and stage sets. A viewer selection for translations into English, possible on a DVD, would have preserved the pace of the film.

Some might think Downfall - ""Der Untergang"" to be aggrandizement of the Nazi aberration that once strode across Europe. Others may find it to be an atonement for the sins of those they can not disassociate themselves from. I found it to be an arresting blend of historical accuracy and the absolute horror and insanity of war. I am thankful I viewed it from my couch rather than in reality.",1201737600,2,3267,4.826785714285714

2151585,5,B0002Z16HY,"A very powerful movie which is as much a dramatic and entertaining movie as it a historically acurate depiction of the last 10 days of the collapse of Berlin and the downfall of Hitler and Hitler's principal advisors and Generals. The movie begins and ends with extracts from an interview with Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary). The movie was shot in St Petersburg in Russia. It's ironic that many of the German army extras were Russians. The movie was a very contentious topic in Germany at the time of its release. I shall take a short detour here to make a point. Please bear with me. In Germany Hitler is Taboo. I have myself been to Germany and to Berlin. I've taken those famous walking tours where they walk you through the streets of Berlin where the last days of the Battle for Berlin concluded into. And I have stood at the place of where Hitler's Bunker was and is still supposed to exist as ruins. But it was amazing to see that the site where Hitler's bunker is supposed to be, there are no great markings or plaques. There's just a gutter there and there are residential appartments. There is a notice which says that it is the site of the infamous bunker but if you were to pass the place, nothing apart that notice would really alert you to the fact that this was the epicenter of the world war 2 from where the orders came in the last few weeks of the war. In Germany, Mein kampf is banned. I came to know first hand when I worked in Frankfurt fror 2 years,I could not get a copy of it even in the major book stores until I came to know it's banned. The display of the swastika is banned. You'll be arrested if you display the swastika symbol. The very mention of the word Hitler is like saying Voldemort in front of the muggles in a Harry Potter film. I have had the chance to talk to my German colleagues about the holocaust and most of my colleagues were all new generation germans who express shame about the things that happened but are clear to point out that they are 2 generations apart from those monsters who were brainwashed into becomming mass murderes. They like to clearly make their point that they are not responsible for their grandfathers actions. But still the shame and the stigma can be seen in their discomfort when dealing with the subject. In German Schools they make it a point to take childeren to concentration camps to impress upon them the horrors of the Nazi regime. They take them to aushwitz and show them the bags upon bags of hair, and pictures etc. All this so that no similar blunders are made in the future. The Bunker site is not marked because of fears of it becomming a shrine for neo nazi ideology. But there is this taboo of depicting Hitler as a human being. They just picture him as a monster but not as a human being. If a nation is totally confident of not repeating its mistakes, then why dehumanize Hitler ?. Why not depict Hitler as a complete human being who has the ability to charm and look like a sane man and not this insane lunatic that we make of him through those old black and white jerky news reel which makes him looks like a mad cartoon character. But there was a lot of debate about this movie because it was seeking to remove Hitler from this image of an evil meglomanical enigma and make him into a human being. At the end of the day Hitler was just a human being. Its his ideology and his philosphical thinking that was the monster. And he had the charisma and the oratory skills to inspire a whole nation and sell a whole nation a warped racism concept based on nazism which the whole country gladly bought into. The director here has made valiant attempt to flesh out hitler and Bruno Ganz who plays hitler is the most convincing hitler to date in films largely because of the aunthenticity of the german actors and the german language spoken and also the great acting by Bruno Ganz. So this attitude of fear about this movie was totally unfounded. A nation who are firmly educating their childeren in school about the Holocaust should not have been concerned about Hitler becomming 'too human'. The more Hitler is seen as a common man and not this unspeakable monster the better will be chances that this won't happen again. Because the next possible hitler will be all too human like the last one. He is not someone with pitch-forks and fangs sticking out of his face like the director correctly points out in the inteview sections of this DVD.

Bruno Ganz has given such authenticity to the role. Anthony Hopkins's act as Hitler cannot compare in anyway close to Bruno Ganz. There is going to be a difference between an American actor portraying Hitler verus a German one. The movie starts with Traud lunge's appointment as secretary. And then we move 2 years ahead and are into april 1945, during the last 10 days. We see Hitlers slow mental redradation OF logical thinking. We are shown his last few days of discussions with Himmler, Goring, Goebells, and other Generals. His continued denial of defeat and illogical thinking in the last few days cost Germany 1000's more lives that could have been saved. He gave orders to people to kill themselves. It shows a nation so completely hynotised by the fuhrer and his ideas that they followed his orders of suicide even after this death. Nazi officals who pulled a trigger to their head for the fuhrer. What person would kill himself after the leader himself is dead ?. We are shown Hitlers last meal and he and Eva Brown retire to their rooms to put an end to their lives. The cynanide does not work and Hitler shoots himself. We don't know for sure what happend because Hitler's bodies were burnt up. But the movie is a reconstruction based on the many accounts of the people who were there. Then we see the heartless Magda Goebells who puts her 5 childeren to sleep with a drug and then when they are asleep slips cynadide doses into their mouths. What kind of heartless mother kills her childeren ?. It really shows the depth of the infestation of the Nazi ideology. Magda is shown as saying she'd rather want her children to die rather than them live in a world where there is no national socialism which was what the Nazi ideology was called. National socialism at that time meant nazi racism, and aryan racial superiority and deemed inferiority of all others. Then Jospeh Gobells shoots Magda with her consent and then shoots himself. What madness!. What mad mad people!. Also we are shown the stark contrast between Magda Goebells and Eva Brown. Although Eva Brown is Hitler's mistress until the very end (getting married to Hitler eventually prior to their suicide), she was a totally non political person. She was this naive character who loved Hitler and did not really look like she either bought into Hitler's thinking or disagreed from his ideology. For her, she had to please hitler because she wanted to be with Hitler. Everything else was secondary. When Hitler gives the orders to kill her own brother in law, she even agrees with that decision after an argument with Hitler. But Eva Brown comes across as a very apolitical person. Compare this with Magda who was often known as the first lady of the Third Reich, Magda in contrast was the ideal Germanic Nazi women. She totally believed and pledged herself to the nazi ideology. More than her love for her husband was her love for the fuhrer and his vision to the extent she believes that a world with hitler is not a world worth living. She takes that decision not only for her but her childeren as well.

When I see all this it is so unbelievable. We see the orgies and the parties that the German generals had during the last few days. As if resigned to death by suicide or death by Russian hands, they saw it as their last days for enjoying the material pleasures of this world and drowned themselves in alcohol and women. What a bunch of mad loonies!. Hitler gave orders to destroy all German infrastructure. His idea was if Germans cant use it,let it not be used by the enemies. But in all this we are shown how he forgot or never even cared about the civilians from the begginning. He saw Germany as a military machinary as this mile upon mile of military robots ready to lay down their lives for his vision, there were no civilans for him. The german people supported Hitler blindly not knowing they were leading themselves to their own deaths. Their Fuherer never cared for any of them, he just cared to build his Germania. He never even cared for the Lebensraum ""living space"" for germans. All he wanted was extended and dominant power. He craved world attention and he screwed the Germans in the process. This movie brings to us the mindless robotic attitude of the Germans. To an extent comming from personal experience I have to say that Germans are the most disciplined lot. They are a people who can work like machine and robots work. I can see how a german back them could have been influenced by Hitler because a German is like a well oiled machine. If given the right stimulus and instuction , he can work like a robot following rules and that too with unacanny efficiency. Its in the German physche. Efficiency and discipline is part of the German pscyche. It's like its hard wired into them at birth. No offense to any Germany but it is my observation. The movie is all about the destruction of the last shred of the third Reich. In the end Himmler and some other Generals try to make peace to get some concessions in their punishment.

We are not shown the Russian plunder of Germany because that is another movie as the director correctly says in the commentary. The Russians soldiers raped 100's of thousands of German women. But some feel it was fully justified and deserved of a civilian poplulation which was as much to blame as the germany military. The army came out of those civilians who were recruited. And they were recruited because of their belief in the noble cause of Hitler. The Germans said they did not know. Thats a bunch of hogwash. Offcourse everyone knew what was going on, they just tried to ignore it, thinking that there was more good in this for the German nation as a whole than bad. But when things went wrong the people tried to portray as if they did not know a damn thing. I think more than Hitler, Germany as a nation and the german civilians back then in that climate of propoganda are the people to be indicted for this monstrous passage of history. They are to blame,to have been so naive, cold and stupid. Without the German people's support Hitler could not have moved a single pebble in Europe. Why was there no major uprising or revolt? Why did not a vast majority see the lunacy of all this ?.

I saw the full film and then i saw the full audio commentary by the director. This movie was a historical revelation for me. It was a precious history lesson. Everything about this movie is historically acurate save for just a few characters who were fictional. The fictional parts are very small and don't detract fom the 99.99 percent accurateness of this account. A lovely movie as well as a lovely documentary on a very important historical and landmark event which shaped the rest of world history.

2151586,5,B0002Z16HY,Downfall was an excellent film-prior to purchasing it I kept reading how the portrayal of Adolf Hitler was very well done and was it ever.  Films of this nature are best done in their native language and subtitled as was Downfall.  It was interesting to see the various characters-Himmler/Goering/Speer/Goebbles etc-only Goebbles (and you could argure Speer) was loyal to the end.  The portrayal of Ms. Junge was also well done-her book is on my list.  Was Hitler all evil?  As a dog lover I can identify with his love for his dog-maybe there's a bit of Hitler in all of us.  It was admirable to see the Wehrmacht fighting to the end-I've read accounts where the Russians were shocked that the army fought on after Hitler died.  All in all this was a very well done film-I am curious though why the Soviet brutalities weren't shown.,1199318400,,832,4.657534246575342
2151587,5,B0002Z16HY,"I have been an avid student of World war II for many years. I have read several books about Hitler including Hitler's Bunker by Joachim Fest. This move is powerful. As I watched it, I was reminded again just how cruel and vicious the Nazi regime was. They were murdering and executing their own people right up to the very end of Hitler's regime. Bruno Ganz gave one powerful performance in the role of Hitler. The movie is a must see production. After watching it, I was reminded again that this evil must not be allowed to happen again. One final thought: the movie is very close to what Fest described in his book.",1199145600,,617,4.421052631578948
2151588,5,B0002Z16HY,"I have decided to see this movie after viewing a documentary ""In the bunker"".  It is amazing how close this film is to the factual events of the last days of Hitler and his party.  Bruno Ganz took a lot of courage to portray one of the most hated man in the human civilazation.  His performance is one of the best I have ever seen.  To me this film was the end of personal debate if Hitler was a mad man or something else. After watching both documentary and this film, I believe that he was not mad, but he was so indoctrinated with the idea of national socialism that he was able to gain strong following amongst his own people.  Such a large group did not contain bunch of mad people, it rather contained lots of people of very much misplaced ideas.  The strength of these ideas is no different of communism in East Europe that spread like fury from Russia to the entire eastern side of the continent.  The indoctrination is so overwhelming that I still cannot overcome the feeling of knowing that Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels and Goebells' wife Magda were ready not only to kill themselves for their (lost) cause, but also sacrifice all of their six young children.  Magda Goebells beats Medea tenfold and gives a new definition to an act of matricide.  Watching film that shows final act(s) of the most important architects of Hitler's government in the last days of the WWII Berlin is very important history lesson for any person.

2151594,3,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is easily the best of that subgenre of Bunker movies (see also Messrs Guinness and Hopkins), but it still doesn't quite work as well as it should. There are fine performances all round from the strong cast (particularly Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun, part mother hen, part best friend, part party girl, part loyal frau), a good script and strong direction, but something always seemed to be missing.

Part of the problem is the way it tones down the material a lot. Of course, this was an extremely risky picture and it's understandable that some characters are whitewashed (such as the 'good' doctor whose real role was much more ambiguous) in an effort to give the audience some human focus to identify with. But the sheer savagery of the fall of Berlin was not really there: the death squads killing civilians were shown in passing (albeit not nearly as prominently as they were in reality), but the understandable barbarity of the Russian troops was very much glossed over (Anthony Beevor's Berlin - The Downfall 1945 - sadly not one of the sources for the film despite the title - gives an excellent account of this). An artistic case can be made for this - the film does make clear that, mad as Hitler and his cohorts were, the civilian population were indeed equally responsible and by focusing on the German characters this is made implicit - but by downplaying the Russians so much, it reduces the almost Biblical scale of sheer horror that they finally reaped. Of course, whether such a film would have been as successful is debatable, and it could have been open to cries of foul for blackening the Russians along with the Nazis, but the film veers too much to good taste in a subject matter where good taste and delicate sensibilities had no place. That's why ultimately it's a fine film with a few great moments rather than a truly great one.",1194912000,6,1861,4.691131498470948

2151599,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is an extraordinary film, primarily because it is made entirely by Germans, soup to nuts.  FINALLY -- a world-class film story made by Germans themselves rather than by Hollywood.

Astonishing acting, superb production/design, spot-on cinematography, gripping dialogue -- it has it all.  It claims to be as historically accurate as possible, which I believe, and which makes the story so profoundly compelling.

I especially liked the special feature on the DVD with lengthy interviews with the actors, director, producer and others in the crew.  Most of them found this project a deeply personal moral struggle, as only Germans can.  They are open about their struggle, which only lends to their performances.

If you were a German actor, would YOU want to play Hitler in a movie?  If you were a German actress, would you want to play Frau Goebbels, who murdered her six children in the name of National Socialism?

Anyone interested in how modern Germans -- at least a handful -- feel about the legacy of the Third Reich should see this film.  It is mandatory.

Anyone else interested in history should see this too -- it is stone-cold jaw-dropping.  You feel as if you are actually there in the bunker, in the presence of madness and evil to be sure, but also of loyalty, bravery, cowardice, fatalism, chaos, confusion and a host of other human emotions, vices and qualities.

Can't recommend this film enough.  Vielen danke!",1191542400,3,1433,4.941422594142259

On the one hand the Fuhrer is a sensitive man with his secretary, with his dog and yet when he talks about soldiers or the German population, there is very little to show that he may, indeed, be referring to living things. The towering ambition of a man who wanted to conquer the world and the way human beings are used towards achieving that ambition - the depiction couldn't be more clear than in this film. The Idea that depends on Life for propagation is suddenly the master and belittles the sacredness of Life itself.

No one should miss this film, including children attending school.",1189296000,,344,4.683333333333334
2151603,5,B0002Z16HY,"Der Untergang is based on the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, Until The Final Hour, and Joachim Fest's Inside The Bunker, and chronicles the last days of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, beginning from his 56th birthday to the surrender of Germany to the Russians.  However, there is a brief aside in the beginning, in November 1942, chronicling the scene where young doe-eyed Traudl Humpts is hired as der Fuhrer's secretary.

The Third Reich is on the verge of collapse throughout this film.  Certain bigshots are positioning themselves, whether to remain in Berlin, loyal to the end (Goebbels, Martin Bormann) or to flee (Heinrich Himmler).  Hitler himself is told by his architect Albert Speer that he must be on the stage when the curtain falls.  And acts of desperation also take effect on that stage.  Josef Goebbels has recruited defenders of the city, many of them in their early teens, who are impressionable enough to want to become heroes.  Sadly, most of them end up as shell fodder for the Russians.

As for the Fuhrer, he is out of touch with reality, the divisions on his map existing only in his imagination.  He still believes that two divisions can regroup and take the Russians from behind, but alas.  And when things don't go his way or he hears reports of lines having fallen, he blames the generals and soldiers, even going out of his way to insult them.  It's ironic how his ideology placed the Germans as the superior race, but when the end is near, he dismisses them of being unworthy of survival and deserving to die.  Quite an about-face there...

Traudl aside, there are others of honourable mention.  Professor Dr. Schenke is concerned with the fate of the civilians during this critical time and is one of the more humane characters involved, as he risks going into Russian held territory to get medical supplies for the wounded.  And as for the wounded, the scene of the limbs being dumped into plates, saws used to amputate, and the sight of the injured are pretty grim, but then again, Germany was up the creek without a paddle, so to say.

Eva Braun's life of the party personality boosts flagging morale during those last days, in the impromptu parties she stages, leading to dancing and drinking.  She even befriends Traudl, confiding in her at one point how she hated Blondi, Hitler's dog and even kicked it when the dictator wasn't looking.

One debit for Nazi history buffs is the where certain major players aren't clearly identified.  Only later in the epilogue, do we realize, ""oh, that was supposed to be Goering, Jodl, Martin Bormann etc.""

I marveled at Bruno Ganz's performance as the angel Damiel in Himmel Uber Berlin, and he outdoes himself as Hitler in this movie, getting the dictator's nervous twitch in his left hand to a tee.  He exhibits bouts of madness, outright callousness, and a man totally out of touch with the reality of the situation.  Yet, he is shown to be gentle and caring to certain individuals, such as his secretary and to Eva Braun.  When one of his trusted henchmen Albert Speer announces his decision to flee, Hitler is saddened, even heartbroken at this desertion.  Ulrich Matthes's portrayal as Josef Goebbels is amazing, as when comparing him to photos of the propaganda minister, there is a striking resemblance.

Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl) is the other great performer that boosts Der Untergang.  Not even a strong National Socialist, she still remains loyal to the Fuhrer, believing in him till it becomes apparent that Germany's defeat is certain.  With the real Traudl Junge bookending the movie in two scenes, I have to say she is hard on herself for not realizing the atrocities that went on during the Reich, even though she wasn't an avid Nazi.

But it's Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, she who believed that there was no future in a world without National Socialism, and coldly poisoned her offspring, making her with someone with more backbone than her husband.  The actual scene when she poisons her children is also quite disturbing.

One of the best movies on Hitler, with the best ever portrayal of him in a movie.  To accompany this, I also recommend the documentary Death In The Bunker, whose events parallel that of Fest's book and this movie.",1189209600,3,4260,4.81043956043956
2151604,5,B0002Z16HY,"I didn't see this movie until recently. I've been a real WW2 buff since junior high but this aspect of it was something I didn't realize or think about. The only other doc I've seen about this subject is a History Channel doc called ""Days That Shook the World"" which was basically high quality renactments with Edward Hermann's fantastic narration.

Based on that and other things I've read, I can honestly say that this is the most accurate WW2 film I've seen in a long time. The events that happen in this film are true to what happened, although they did compress things. They created some moments, such as the young boy Peter Granz, that distilled the real situation. More than that, they do a better job than most WW2 films of showing that these Germans, even Hitler and Goebells, as human beings, psychotic human beings, but human none the less.

Amazing cinemtography captures the darkness of the time, when the city was being shelled and attacked by the Russians. It's dirty and never glamourous and clean and even when it is, it looks surreal and almost ridiculous.

There are moments that cause you to look away from the screen, the Goebells' children cheif among them. But it makes it that much more amazing.

The performances make you feel like the cameramen were embedded with the nazi's in the bunker. Bruno Ganz channels Hitler, his seductive qualities as well as his psychotic qualities. Yelling at his officers and staff, calmly talking about suicide, being almost fatherly to Eva and Traudl, all of that add's to his complexity. It's a stunning performance. My other favorite performance comes from Christian Berkel who plays Dr. Schenk.

The fact that this is a German film makes it even better. For once, you see Germans, Nazi's speaking in German. It brings the authenticity to the film.

2151607,4,B0002Z16HY,"Based on the book, ""Bis zur letzen Stunde""  by Traudl Junge and Melissa Mueller, director Oliver  Hirschbiegel's 2004 film about the end of Nazi Germany is the most sobering account of that event to date, and told appropriately in its native language.
  It begins in 1942 when a group of frightened, wide-eyed young secretaries are escorted into a Quonset hut under guard, and made to  wait outside an office. Among them is Traudl Humps(Alexandra Maria Lara), a young woman whose family wished for her to avoid close association with the Nazis, who is chosen for the position of Secretary to Der Fuhrer.
 The Swiss-born Bruno Ganz's first appearance as Hitler in this increasingly dark drama is spellbinding because he doesn't appear menacing, but as an aging military officer having a convivial chat with a new employee....
 Fast forward to three years later...What Germany sent around had come back around. Berlin is under heavy siege as the Soviets advance, and after over 700 years of periodic German invasions, and ultimately having the largest number of casualties in what the Russians call ""The Second Great Patriotic War""--in which every family in the country lost someone, they just weren't going to be nice people.
 The main focus is on the claustrophobic conditions of the Fuhrerbunker in the waning days of April and May of 1945.
 The film introduced me to the saga of  Dr. Ernst-Robert Grawitz (Christian Hoening), whose falling out with Hitler  led him to blow himself and his family up at dinnertime, six days before Hitler's demise by his own hand.
 On the streets of Berlin, Hitlerjugend prepare to defend the city to the death. The most prominent of these is the ill-fated Inge Dombrowski (Yelena Zelenskaya), a striking young girl with blonde braids dangling beneath her warrior's helmet. Her friend, Peter Kranz (Donevan Guina)was honored for a combat mission during one of Hitler's final public appearances.
 Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun is slimmer, harder, ane more intelligent-looking than Hitler's actual wife-to-be. She presides over one final party in a scene whose desperate gaiety is highly reminiscent of how Ancient Rome looked just before its downfall. Later, in between discussing quick and painless methods of suicide between Hitler, Traudl, Gerda Christian(Birgit Minichmayr), et. al, Eva invites the secretaries for a walk outside where they encounter a ready made bouquet of white flowers springing up amid the ugliness of the demolished world around them.--A moment of such wistfulness and ironic beauty.
 Hitler, shaking from Parkinson's Disease, still manages to give orders, including one for the execution of Eva's brother-in-law, SS-Gruppenfuhrer Herman Fegelein (Thomas Kretschmann) for disloyalty despite Eva's pleas on his behalf. His orders regarding combat strategy  reveal that he, like all dictators, has lost touch with reality.
 Certain details struck me as odd; Why were some in Hitler's inner circle smoking when he objected to that vice? And why is the vegetarian Hitler shown eating meat ravioli for a last meal?
 I had a sense of deja vu watching  Anna Thalbach as Hanna Reistch. She is the doppelganger of her mother Katharina, who played Wanda in ""Sophie's Choice"" over two decades earlier.
 Ullrich Matthes is a sinisterly beady-eyed Josef Goebbels(sans the clubbed foot). Heinrich Schmieden's Rochus Misch seems largely impassive to the goings-on around him.
 There are many elements to keep track of in this film. A significant amount of the drama revolves around the arrival of Magda Goebbels(Corinna Harfouch) and her six children. A conversation with Albert Speer ( Heino Ferch) reveals Magda's intentions for her children. She fogoes Speer's offer to take them to safety; in real life, she rejected a similar plea from her oldest son, Harald.
 Eva and Adolf marry as cyanide is tested on Hitler's dog, Blondi(whose pups were put down as well).
 Hours before her death, Eva confides her feelings about Blondi to Traudl, and gives Traudl one of her possessions.  The Hitlers say farewell to their staff, and Magda, who later begs  for Hitler to save himself receives a pathetic badge as a reward for over a decade of loyalty.
 As Traudl gives Goebbel's darling children their lunch, the Hitlers meet their notorious end. No words are needed to express Traudl's feelings as she visits the empty chamber shortly thereafter.
 That evening, Magda enters her children's room with a sleeping draught mixed by Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger(Thorsten Krohn), and while little Heide(Amelie Menges), Hilde(Charlotte Stoiber), Helmut(Gregory Borlein), Hedda(Julia Bauer), and Holde (Laura Borlein) sip compliantly, Aline Sokar gives a memorable performance as 12 1/2-year-old Helga Susanne Goebbels (who turned seven the day WWII began); a child raging futilely against the dying of the light, suspecting the truth of her mother's intentions. The scene of their extermination is handled less gently here than in the 1981 film, ""The Bunker"".
 Soon afterwards, Josef and Magda join the contiguous parade of death, leaving behind those who must use all their cunning to survive.
 The real Traudl Humps Junge is shown speaking at the end, expressing remorse for her blindness to what the Nazi regime stood for. The audience can make up its own mind about her sincerity.
 Comparisons to modern events will be left to other reviewers. But viewers of this film would do well to consider them. For it is a powerful drama with a timely cautionary tale brought forth by a powerful nation  that has come to terms with its past.",1187913600,3,5558,5.184563758389261

2151609,5,B0002Z16HY,"To the many surprisingly excellent reviews of ""Downfall"" I will add only this additional impression. As a German speaker I was very gratified and not a little amazed at how well the spoken German in the movie fit the characters. Bruno Ganz (Hitler) is an Austrian, and perhaps that is why he was able to recreate Hitler's Austrian accent and pronunciation so flawlessly. The translations for the English subtitles were generally accurate although not every German word could be translated verbatim.

If you do not speak German, try turning off the subtitles and watching the movie again after you've already seen it a couple of times.  This is an interesting way to watch foreign language movies, and I found it oddly enjoyable and entertaining in a uniquely different way when, as a person who does not understand French, I watched the French language version of Cyrano De Bergerac (starring Grard Depardieu in the title role). On the third viewing I watched it without English subtitles and I must say it was an amazing experience.",1187481600,,1033,4.931034482758621
2151610,4,B0002Z16HY,"They say war is hell, and this is one of the best movies I have seen to depict said truism. Without any footage at all of the holocaust or the concentration camps, Downfall tells the story of Hitler and his followers (and their loyalty) as the Third Reich crumbles around him.

The dedication to the Nationalist Socialist vision is palpable in the bunker, and the scene of Frau Goebbels dosing her five children so that they will sleep so that she can then dose them with cyanide is heart-rending - and yet she is so steadfast in her belief that a world without Nationalist Socialism is no world for her children that she simply refuses to grieve for her loss - except for the loss of the vision itself.

Seen primarily through the eyes of Hitler's secretary, the movie opens and closes with an interview with the woman herself - who, in the beginning, tries to find compassion for herself for being young and naive when choosing to work for Hitler. Then, after the war, she saw a monument dedicated to Sophie Scholl, of the White Rose movement - who was the same age as she was. ""I knew then,"" she said, ""That youth was no excuse. I had the ability to make choices - and the responsibility to find out what I did not know.""

Powerful.

If anyone takes the time to read every one of the available works on this exact period of time, especially the best one ever written by O'Donnell, and one watches the nuances, carefully looks over the uniforms, and more carefully eyes the sets, the viewer will note that the movie comes about as close to being on the site and filming what actually happened as could possibly be. That the film was shot in German makes it almost 100% authentic. Sure, the street scenes outside the ReichsKanzlei are in Russia, and are not exactly to a strict interpretation of what actually existed, and a few other very minor points (some of the Generals in the bunker portrayed as bald were not bald). Nobody can be perfect - sort of like the movie Gettysburg that cast Winfield Scott Hancock played by a 5'5"" man when Hancock was actually 6'1"" - but Downfall comes about as close to perfection as can be.

This is an astounding film experience for those with the stomach for it. Ganz renders Hitler so expertly that the effect is spooky, as if the dead had been brought back to life. Other searing performances come from Juliane Kohler as a curiously cheery, detached Eva Braun, and both Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch make your blood run cold playing the twisted, ever loyal Josef and Magda Goebbels. Finally, the delicate, wide-eyed Lara beguiles as Traudl, a mostly innocent lamb placed by fate right in the center of the wolf's lair.

Highly recommended for everyone who has even the slightest interest in what happened in the last days of the Third Reich and the fall of Berlin, or the insanity of men, or the corruption of the minds of women, or the dedication of people to leaders as gods, or why religion (in this case National Socialism) is such a destructive force for man and a dynamic force of attraction for women. This film is shocking in its content and riveting in the development of the historical events.  It is in the German language with English subtitles which are easy to get by if you don't speak Deutch, so don't let that be a put-off...the film is THAT good.

2151620,5,B0002Z16HY,"Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, Der Untergang (Downfall) is truly an unforgettable cinematic experience. With the brilliant acting of Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, and an equally talented cast surrounding him, Downfall delivers stellar quality in all aspects.

The film depicts the last days of Hitler and his crumbling regime. Ganz delivers, without question, some of the finest acting captured on screen. His portrayal of a physicall, mentally, and emotionally deteriorating despot is a sight to behold. You no longer see an 'actor', but Hitler himself.

We, the audience, watch from the perspective of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary played by Alexandra Maria Lara. There are many aspects to this film additional to Hitler's singular downfall which make this film as powerful as it is.

There have been criticisms of this film along the lines of making Nazi's heroes of Hollywood. Let me dismiss those criticisms. This film depicts merely what occurred during that time. I think, with the exception of the radical few, that what the Nazi regime did was, to say the least, heinous. However, this film is in no way glorifying any of that.

The current price is around 10 dollars for this film and really, for 10 bucks you cannot get a better film. This won't be a mindless action/feel-good movie. It is intense from beginning to end. But at the end, you will walk away having been given an intimate look into history and into the downfall of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.",1183852800,,1476,4.963562753036437
2151621,5,B0002Z16HY,"It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part.  The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his ""love"" for the German people.  In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable.  Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.

Alexandra Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture.  She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been.  Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted.  The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger.  Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on.  But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well.  Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.

Of course she was hardly the only one.  An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation and near-starvation, and ignominious defeat.  One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality.  Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be.  Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen.  There might be something to that, but I doubt it.  Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.

It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin.  I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.

I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty.  This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal.  And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal.  Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves.  They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.

The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort.  We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another.  The stench is overwhelming.  We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.

Can it happen again?  Can it happen here?  Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty.  It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.

Director Oliver Hirschbieger deftly pulls it all together and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through--even though we all know how the tale ended.

The film gets under your skin and gnaws at your psyche long after you have seen it--and that is some trick. How were the makers of this motion picture able to accomplish this? By avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his murderous SS thugs as two-dimensional cartoon characters, instead they show the lot of  them to be what they were: human. Mixed-up, misguided, fanatical, barberic, coldblooded mass-murderers--and all in the quest for power (that they never attained), but human none-the-less.

What is sad here, as far as I am concerned, instead of encouraging his nation to focus all that energy on making the world a better place, because Germans, the German people, have given us so much more than fine cars and excellent beer and camera lenses...Hitler and his thugs had their people squandering all that  potential on causing destruction and mayhem, misery and pain...for nothing.

I realize quite a few Germans didn't care for Hitler and his loony notions...only there wasn't much they could do about it (once he came into power and they saw where he was actually taking them...straight to Hell). Any German who opposed the dreaded SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or in some camp somewhere to suffer the consequences.

I always wondered what it must have been like for Hitler and his people down in that bunker during the final months/weeks/days... This powerful motion picture shows you what went on--and then some.",1180224000,9,1779,4.778501628664495

2151630,5,B0002Z16HY,"After watching this film I can better understand why there was an uproar in Germany about the film's protrayal of Hitler.  Instead of a maniacal ranting monster, you see a man, sick and old beyond his years, falling apart in front of our eyes and his followers (with a few exceptions) act as if nothing is wrong.  It is not so much about Hitler's rise to power and taking millions of enthusiasts along with him but rather as the situation disintegrates, no one takes action to end the madness.  I think this is the point that bothered many Germans - not that he came to power but that up until the end, he retained power.

This is a movie exceptionally well acted.  The cast does well in their portrayals of all the members of the staff in the bunker at the end of the war.  It is also a movie of awful realism from fighting in the streets, citizens being hung as possible traitors and Magda Goebbels killing her children.  Young boys are greeted by an enfeebled Hitler and given Iron Crosses knowing that soon they would be taking on Russian soldiers, tanks and artillery.  It is chilling to watch.

I was stationed in Berlin from 1977 to 1980.  Just over the wall near Checkpoiont Charlie one could see a mound of earth that was supposed to be the site of the underground bunker.  The Berlin I saw and rememebered bore no resemblance to the bombed out shell that was 1945 Berlin except for a few buildings in the Eastern Sector that hadn't been repaired (churches mostly) which gave a slight indication of how the city looked in 1945. The recreation of the wrecked city above the bunker was critical to the succes of the film.  Unreality below ground, hell on earth above.

I would recommend this film as a very fine protrayal of the last remmants of Hitler's immediate staff and followers.  It is almost a must see for historians and those with an interest in history.  It certainly gives a grim appearance.",1176854400,2,1910,4.511627906976744

2151632,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is the story of the last days of Adolf Hitler as the Russians remorselessly close in on the Fhrerbunker. It is told partially through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, and the film begins and ends with the real Traudl Junge speaking (she died in 2002). The film proper starts with the midnight selection as a secretary for Hitler of Frulein Gertraud Humps (Junge was her married name) from among 5 hopefuls, mainly, the film suggests, because she came from Munich, with which Hitler had close connections and for which he had much affection.

The really good thing about this film is Swiss actor Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler. One can't imagine anyone ever doing it better. Everything, the tantrums of rage, the loss of reality and refuge in fantasy, the intrusion of bitter reality, the ever-shaking hand, which he sought to hide, all brilliantly captured. I was pleased to see that they subtitled the film rather than dubbed it; Hitler never lost his Austrian accent and Ganz's coarse accent stands in sharp contrast to those of the polished Hochdeutsch speakers around him). Ganz's Hitler is a train crash in slow motion as his worlds, real and fantasy,  collapse around him and his closest followers (Goering, even Himmler ""der treue Heinrich"") seek to save their own skins. I've heard criticisms that this portrayal of Hitler makes him too human, but this, to me, makes the portrait that much more effective. After all, all this death and destruction was not brought about by aliens from another planet, but by people from this one, and moreover from a nation that has given the world so much, especially in the field of great music. I suspect that people like the ""monster"" portrait, because they can then distance themselves from the monster (""we're not like THAT""). However, this is the monster that lurks within us all and all it needs is the right circumstances to bring it forth. It should be remembered that the current allegedly Christian President of the USA is happy to have people tortured. The slippery slope is not as far away as you think.

You look at this wreckage of a person so beautifully played by Ganz and wonder, why on earth did all these people follow him to the bitter end? In one scene, Goebbels in close to tears when Hitler orders him to leave Berlin and confides to Traudl Junge that he will disobey a Fhrer order for the first time. In another scene, Magda Goebbels intimates to Albert Speer that she will kill her six children (all of whose Christian names start with ""H"" in admiration for Hitler). ""I beg you to reconsider, Magda,"" protests Speer, ""those children deserve a future."" ""There is no future without National Socialism,"" replies Frau Goebbels. She is seen later breaking cyanide capsules in their mouths (having first given them all a sleeping potion), before she and her husband commit suicide (true, but depicted inaccurately). Why this determination to remain with an obviously sinking ship? In an era where fanaticism of all kinds is again on the rise, we need to understand why and disseminate the answers and lessons more widely. The current state of the world is evidence that we have not done so very well.

The world of the collapsing Third Reich is beautifully (if that's the word) captured, with people partying wildly as the world falls apart around them, fanatics stringing up ""defeatists"" from the lamp posts, even as obvious and very real defeat looms, the fanatical kids of the Hitler Youth trying courageously but vainly to stop the Russian onslaught, even the German guards carrying Sturmgewehre, early assault rifles of the type that Mr. Kalsahnikov would later make famous.

So, what are the negatives? Only one really; the film smacks a little of a whitewash, of portraying to some extent the Germans as the innocent victims of the deranged Nazis, so that the Germans don't feel too bad. I confess I don't know the history in any great detail, but when an SS Brigadefhrer (brigadier-general) starts to worry about civilian casualties and the death of the elderly, I start to wonder. The soldiers are all terribly honourable and sensible - it's the rabid Nazis of the film, such as Josef Goebbels (chillingly played by Ulrich Matthes) who want to fight to the end for the Fhrer and who are totally callous of human life. Most of all, there's the central figure of Traudl Junge, played as a wide-eyed ingnue by the delicious Alexandra Maria Lara. Nicely played to be sure, but was this really how it was? After all, she married a Waffen-SS officer (killed in Normandy), and THEY were the prime examples of Nazi racial ideology (the fact that she was married and widowed is not mentioned in the film). At the beginning, the real Traudl Junge says that she was never an enthusiastic National Socialist and at the end she related her shock and shame at finding that fellow Mnchenerin, the heroic Sophie Scholl of the White Rose resistance group, was born in the same year and was en route to the guillotine as Junge took the Hitler job. And when Hitler dictates his political testament to Junge, should she have looked so shocked at the bit about the enemy International Jewry? Perhaps there's more than an uncomfortable element of truth in a statement by Goebbels, when he says dismissively to the abovementioned SS Brigadefhrer words to the effect of ""it's the people's fault, they voted for this.""

In conclusion, in spite of my pernickety reservations, an outstanding film, well worth seeing.",1176163200,9,5480,4.836886993603412
2151633,5,B0002Z16HY,"Wow, this is one fine film. I disagree with the many on here who claim this whitewashes the Nazis, or makes Hitler cuddly. Those folks were watching some other film. These are brutal, vicious, cold and evil people, willing to sacrifice any number of individuals for a corporate goal. And who cares whether the secretaries have sufficient blame. Of no consequence! The story is gripping, the collapse of a world where one man's will made an empire and then caused that empire to crumble, leaving behind smoking rubble, panic, butchery, death, and chaos. No better evocation exists that I know of showing what happens when man elevates man to omniscience and omnipotence, and then watches the inevitable collapse.

The Hitler we see is a man completely used to having his will carried out, and for the first time he can no longer exercise that will. The needed soldiers aren't there. The ammunition is spent. The Russians are closing in. He cannot speak the world he wants into existence any more, and he opts to kill himself when denied that power. One detail is piled onto another, deftly showing how Germany has transferred all thinking and reasoning to one man, one evil man, and is now reaping the consequences. Two scenes stand out. Eva Braun, played wonderfully as girl who likes to party and dance, but is nevertheless totally devoted, begs for the life of her brother in law. Hitler says ""No mercy for traitors"" and she replies, quite reasonably, ""What difference does that make now? It's all over. Think of my pregnant sister!"" But justice must be carried out, because, as Hitler thunders ""It is my will!"" Eva says, ""You are the Fuhrer"" and the argument is closed. 90 seconds captures it all.

In another brief episode, a young nurse, who has never known a world without Hitler's all-encompassing leadership, begs him to act to save Germany. If he would speak, Germany would be saved. What a lovely quick portrait of a generation that has given up its power of thought.

There are many other great touches. The feel is claustrophobic and shabby, with shiny silverware and lovely chandeliers incapable of disguising the ever-present fact that they are hidden underground in an ugly concrete fortress where the lights flicker regularly. Frau Goebbels finishing off her lovely children, saving them from a world without National Socialism. We watch in disgust as she kills these gorgeous young angels. And Hitler being asked for an ID card at his wedding? Perfect. The law above all things!

How anyone could feel anything other than contempt and disgust for these savages is beyond me. Oh yes, they were people, indeed. Maybe that's what this film's many critics don't like; we prefer our monsters to be something other than human, and therefore, unlike us. But this story is the tale of people just like us. People who thought they were working for ""good."" People who believed in the human goodness, and found death the only way out when they lost that faith.",1175817600,16,2966,4.855731225296442
2151634,4,B0002Z16HY,"The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, ""Downfall"" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.

Oliver Hirschbiegel's film has been criticized by some circles as presenting a ""too sympathetic"" portrait of the Fuhrer. I don't believe anything in the film suggests that its creators sympathize with the Nazi regime and those who had orchestrated it.

Showing Hitler as a human being (amazing performance by Bruno Ganz), a man who loved his dog, was a vegetarian and could display some moments of tenderness did not undermine the overall image of a lonely, domineering, conscienceless, and hateful man who believed that his people, his compatriots, women and children deserve to die because they are no longer deserve to live and because ""in a war as such there are no civilians"".

Did those who think that that the film ""humanized"" Hitler forget the most chilling scene in the movie, the one that shows Frau Goebbels crush the ampoules with cyanide between her children's teeth, after they had been dosed with a sleeping draught? She did it not because she was scared of what would happen to them after the war, no, her reason was, ""The country without National Socialism and its party is not worth living in"". How dangerous Hitler was if he could induce such a blind devotion that could convince a mother of six to murder her children in cold blood.

Bernd Eichinger, the producer and scriptwriter of ""Downfall"" emphasized, the greatest danger he saw in making a film about Hitler was the temptation to show him as a psychopath or madman: ""Hitler possessed an enormous criminal and destructive energy, and he was a barbarian in the most fundamental sense of the term... But I am convinced that he was totally of sound mind until the very end, which is why leadership never slipped from his hands.""

The film's director Oliver Hirschbiege says that, in the same way it was evil of Hitler to see Jews as less than human beings - i.e. as ""insects"" - it would be equally wrong to portray Hitler as a madman, because that would excuse him of culpability: ""I think the biggest mistake is to have an image of Hitler as insane - that he was not a human being but a monster. The most important point to realize is that Hitler was not a madman, not a psychopath or someone on drugs, which implies that he wasn't responsible for what he was doing. Of course he was responsible! ""For me, (this film is) paying homage to and truly honoring the victims, because we fall short if we explain the Holocaust by stating that they were all out of their minds. They knew what they were doing!""

I believe that the result of their work, the film I saw last night is absolutely unforgettable - honest, powerful and devastating. It is a masterwork of film-making and a very important in its objectivity historical document.

I'm not German and I have the feeling that this film is mainly intended to a German audience. As for the facts described in DOWNFALL, I confess that I haven't enough studied these peculiar events to judge if the film is accurate or not. WWII and Adolf Hitler are still too close to me to let me judge with objectivity DOWNFALL. Furthermore, I'm sure that, like me, most of the reviewers here have members of their family still alive who can speak about Hitler and the horrors associated with National-Socialism.

Now, if I consider DOWNFALL only as a cine film, such as John Wayne's ALAMO for instance in order to stay in the same film category, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film provides the kind of tension one can expect from a war movie. There are no heroes in the film, except maybe for the German people whom Hitler and his Generals are ready to sacrifice to their self-pride. And, most of all, Olivier Hirschbiegel doesn't find any excuses in the behavior of the last soldiers of the Third Reich. But, as I said before, Hitler's figure is still too close to us to let European directors shoot a Hollywood style movie about him.

2151637,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a near flawless movie, well deserving of a wide audience. The fact that it is a German movie which required watching subtitles, may put some people off - but the reality is that the German actors give this much more resonance than any Hollywood version could have.

Much has been said about the fantastic performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. This is his movie, no doubt. It should also be mentioned, however, that all of the performances are so spot on that we are removed from a theatrical overview of events, and truly become part of life in the bunker. So many movies of this period show either the two dimensional Nazi bad guys and Hitler as a raving lunatic and nothing else, or a dispassionate overview of the tactics of the battle for Berlin. This movie achieves something rare - a real personal insight into the characters and how they informed the battle tactics and actions of individuals.

Our view into this world is through the young and naive private secretary Traudl Junge, who wrote one of the books on which the movie is based. Thus, historical accuracy is very high. But what we see is an insight into the humanity of Hitler - in one moment warm and compassionate, the next brutal and vulgar. We can understand through Ganz' portrayal the charisma the man must have had to attract such loyal devotion.

Do not be fooled into thinking that a movie about life in the bunker will be small scale low budget sets.. the movie ventures outside and we get glimpses of some terrible battle scenes. Those with DTS capability for surround sound will be richly rewarded. The scenes of a war ravaged Berlin are incredibly real - in fact, shot in Saint Petersburg.

Towards the end the scenes become more and more disturbing as the veneer of normality is stripped away as the war looms closer. Scenes of suicides and murders are truly disturbing - not least the scene where Magda Goebbels, having sworn her children should not survive in a world without National Socialism, calmly murders them in their sleep, one at a time, before calmly sitting down to a game of cards.

At once compelling in the drama of a city at war, and engrossing for its insight into characters normally cinema is too scared to show as humanity, this is perhaps one of the most insightful movies into the horror of National Socialism in WW II and the man who created it. The movie is bookended by the real Traudl Junge speaking in a 2001 documentary, adding an entirely appropriate coda to the movie showing its relevance to all of us.

Thoroughly and unreservedly recommended.",1172361600,3,2564,4.6490066225165565
2151638,3,B0002Z16HY,"If you want to know how it feels to enter the abyss, then watch this movie.  The viewer is crushed by the heartache of the coming end of the Reich, and wonders how any person could emerge from it with a measure of sanity remaining.  Civilians trapped in the street fighting; children enduring tank assaults; the constant drumbeat of incoming artillery; and meanwhile against the constant backdrop of the unreality of the Fuhrerbunker, the men and women living in their ""wolkenskukushiem.""

What is it like to experience total and utter defeat?  The world you have known is collapsing around you, and you are totally helpless to stop it.
Watch the face of the actor who plays Brigadefuhrer Mohnke as he hears Gbbels telling him that the German people will have their ""little throats"" cut.  What would go through YOUR mind?  Watch as an SS doctor works his way through the bunker, even as men of the Nordland and Charlemagne SS troops (yes... Norwegians and French volunteers fighting the last battle around the Fhrerbunker) recheck their equipment and load what little ammunition they have left.  The shock on Gen. Helmut Weidling's face, the commander of the famed 56th PanzerKorps, as he is told that HE's now the commandant of Berlin's defenses.  The flash of reality that crosses Eva Braun's face when she gives away her mink coat to Traudl Junge, a rare glimpse through the forced happiness she otherwise displayed.

But in the midst of the carnage there is real courage.  Forget the politics, forget the Nazis, as you see that there were people who displayed REAL courage in hopeless circumstances...  soldiers and civilians fighting hopeless battles through the crumbling streets of Berlin.  My mother saw and experienced some of this same anguish in Southern Germany.

But now for the problem-- a BIG problem.  Soviet atrocities are completely expunged.  Even Traudl Junge is shown to have escaped the Russians unscathed... pure fantasy.  She was raped by the Soviets numerous times.  While SS and Nazi atrocities are shown repeatedly, (guys hanging ""defeatists"" for example), there is not ONE Russian atrocity displayed.  Not one.  Thus, despite the fact that the movie is well done and reasonably accurate historically in many areas, it actually strives to rewrite and sanitize history.

Nevertheless, the acting is well done.  Ganz does a superb job of humanizing Hitler, which of course makes this movie controversial.  Despite the problem above, and my three star rating, the movie is still worth seeing, or even owning.  The scenes are riveting and heartrending, and will remind us of the tragedy that became known as the Battle of Berlin.  It should also remind us of what happens when people surrender themselves to the power of the State, to let the State run their lives and ""care"" for them in its brutal maw.",1171584000,190,2826,4.976545842217484

2151640,5,B0002Z16HY,"Simply put, one finds out a lot about people when the chips are down.  As it becomes apparent to everyone that not only are the best days of the Nazis behind them, but the coming end of the 1000-Year Reich can be counted in days rather than years, the assorted characters exhibit as wide a range of responses as is possible.

Amost the entire cast of characters is portrayed.  The sycophantic Himmler pledges eternal loyalty & immediately attempts to cut a self-preserving deal with the allies.  Meanwhile, an equally sycophantic Albert Speer comes to the realization that, at long long last, enough is enough --- and defies Hitler's order to consign the German people to certain destruction.  Some subordinates realize, too late, that they have been following a false idol.  Others, like Magda Goebbels, never give up the faith & pursue their devotion to Hitler & National Socialism to its horrifying conclusion.  The generals, comprised at this point almost entirely of toadying yes-men, know that Hitler is ordering the movement of phantom armies & is totally divorced from the reality of the war, but their fundamental spinelessness prevents them, even when it is clear that all is lost, from telling their boss that he has no idea what he is doing.

Other characters display flashes of humanity.  Some detractors have seen this, along with the portrayal of Hitler's warmer side with close associates, as evidence of a sort of German apologism, but it is only honest filmmaking.  Nobody is a one-dimensional cartoon figure, and even the worst of human beings have their good moments, despite their normally wretched personalities.  In some cases, the dire straits of Berlin's collapse result in some normally vile individuals displaying compassionate behavior because it truly is what the situation must call for.  By contrast, some people (and Magda Goebbels surely must come to mind here in probably the most heart-rending scene in the film) make the most sickening choices possible.

What struck me most about this film was the study & portrayal of disintegration.  As Germany collapsed, Hitler's own mind & spirit rapidly unravel.  As Hitler collapses, his subordinates, who by following Hitler abdicated their responsibilities as members of the human race, are forced to make individual reckonings with their deeds and the disintegration of the artificial worlds they have created.  Collapse begets collapse.

These interviews remind one of Americans discussing Vietnam & Nixon, facing up to ""our own"" legacy.  The film is historically credible except for its overemphasis on the role of the Russians to the exclusion of the Anglo-American forces (the movie was filmed in St. Petersburg).

2151643,5,B0002Z16HY,"Nominated for best foreign film in 2004, Downfall recreates Hitler's final days in his underground Berlin bunker. The film opens with a real life clip from Traudl Junge, age 81, whom Hitler hired as his secretary when she was only 22. Junge wrote a memoir about her experiences, and sat for a lengthy interview-turned-movie called Blindspot (2002), both of which served as material for Downfall. Struggling to forgive herself, Junge remarks, ""I never thought that fate would take me somewhere I'd never really wanted to be."" But contrary to Hitler's insistence that she and others flee Berlin as the Russians invaded, Junge stayed to the bitter end. Delusional, paranoid, and mercilessly disdainful of the German citizenry who suffered the carnage of his megalomania, it is chilling to watch Hitler and his volcanic rage as the end approaches. He screams about betrayal, and strategizes with battalions that no longer exist. At 155 minutes, this is a long film, but even though we know the outcome before we begin, the film maintains its dramatic tension. Strong portrayals of Eva Braun, who married Hitler in the bunker a few days before they both committed suicide, Himmler and Goebbels enrich the plot. Magda Goebbels murdered her six kids with cyanide pills rather than have them live in a world without Nazi Socialism. Downfall reminded me of the idiocy and horror of war, its catastrophic human toll, and the consequences of leaders who are blinded by ideology, surrounded by sycophants, and deaf to genuine criticism.

2151644,5,B0002Z16HY,"Who would have thought you could shed tears for the Nazis?

""Downfall"" is a sad, grim movie about the last days of Nazi Germany. It takes place in corridors and sealed rooms, deep underground, with occasional forays into the shattered surface world of Berlin mere hours before the Russians overran it.

The main character in the story is Tradl Junge, and was based in part on her memoirs, who as a young woman was hired as Hitler's secratary. Now after three years in his employ, she's seen him go through all sorts of moods, but hasn't until now seen him grimly suicidal.

Hitler isn't the only one. Left and right his generals and commanders start killing themselves, at least those who don't try desprately to leave Berlin. Himmler even muses about making a peace with the Allies and wonders if, upon meeting Eisenhower, he should shake his hand or give the Nazi salute.

The movie is also about the innocent. You see a young boy, not even old enough to shave, with his friends. All of them are wearing Hitler Youth uniforms. We learn in time that the boy is being given a medal for destroying two Russian tanks. His father is horrified. The boy, convinced he's immortal, is proud of himself, and ashamed of his father.

The saddest of the innocent, though, are the Goebbels children. In the bunker they sing and play, and Frauline Junge does her best to look after them. Then their mother says she doesn't want them growing up in a world without National Socialism. Not long after, all the children are dead; killed by their mother, who is then shot by her husband, who then kills himself.

The last days of the Nazi regeime leaves those more mythologically inclined to have flashbacks to Ragnarok, the Norse myth about the end of the world. Hitler, obsessed with appocalyptic imagry, seemed determined to bring about his own Ragnarok. You see him having conversations about how the German people failed him, and if they die, well, they'll get what they deserve. Towards the end he issus commands that even his loyal followers, like Albert Speer, are unable to follow.

In the final scenes we see Tradl Junge and our young Hitler Youth member escape into the countryside on a bicycle. Yes, their lives as they know them are over, and there's sadness, but also a feeling of hope, and one remembers these are the people who in later years built Germany into the dynamo it's become.

The movie is indeed sad, but also at the end uplifting and well worth seeing. Yes, it's in German with subtitles, but, well, deal. It's worth it. Trust me.",1169424000,2,2540,4.654017857142857

This is a theme fit for Shakespeare or Sophocles: a man who had risen from nothing to achieve continental domination and demigod status is overthrown by hubris and fickle Fate and is facing his last days with his most loyal followers, while the enemies' armies are blocks away and tightening the noose.

2151647,4,B0002Z16HY,"Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes... Movies like ""Patton"" show brief sights into German military thinking while ""The Pianist"" finds a good cultured German officer in a nightmare scenario...

""Downfall"" tells the story of the Fhrer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole the city...

Mostly through the eyes of his young Bavarian secretary, Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) we see the ailing and obviously delusional Fhrer allowing no negotiation with the Allied forces, raving about how his generals betrayed him, ordering the movement of troops that do not exist, screaming that the German people do not deserve to survive for their apparent treachery and cowardice...

But what has come under criticism is the film's attempt at giving Hitler--whose face has become symbolic for the epitome of evil--a compassionate side... He's ""Uncle Hitler"" to the children of Josef Goebbles who happily sings for him, so loving for his blonde wife Eva Brown, so kind to his pet dog Blondi, so caring when he awards a young boy (who showed great bravery in the face of the enemy) with a medal and pinches his cheek, and so gentle when he pins a medal on Magda Goebbels for being the 'bravest mother in the Reich'.

It's easy to see why the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Film Category... It takes you inside the minds of Hitler's faithful, showing you how it was that one infamous man could be so charismatic and magnetic... Although his closest advisors, the remaining dedicated members of the Nazi government, know that there is no hope, no one was seen willing to challenge his orders or attempt to seize power... And many opted for suicide after living out their final hours in obscene denial, singing and dancing champagne glass in hand...

But Hitler's dark side is also shown when the film depicts his hate and antipathy for the Jews; when one of the more ""rational"" members of the Nazi hierarchy, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), stated gently but bluntly to him that the war was lost and he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities; also when he becomes convinced that Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) has betrayed him and must be executed; and when Eva Braun pleads him for her brother-in-law's life, the tormented Hermann Fegelin (Thomas Kretschmann), and he furiously rejected her request...

One of the most horrifying sequences that is unforgettable was that of Magda Goebbles played by Corinna Harfouch... It is astonishing to witness how an unstoppable steely mother, with no hesitation or remorse, is capable of such atrocities for a blind and irrational loyalty to a 'charming' monster...

Ganz's character is equally psychotic and human, capable of shooting even his most loyal followers and utterly believable as Uncle Hitler...

Juliane Khler complements Ganz's exceptional performance with her own chillingly fine one as the ultimate blind follower whose loyalty to her Fhrer never flagged... Khler shows us how she can be drunkenly carefree dancing to swing as bombs and artillery shake the walls of the bunker one day, and in another day applying a fresh coat of red lipstick to her fleshy lips before she takes one cyanide tablet for the man she preferred not to live without...

The focus is primarily the concluding weeks of Hitler's life in a bunker in the heart of Berlin with Russian troops slowly surrounding the city, and eventually invading.  Bruno Ganz gives a simply stunning performance as Hitler, a megalomaniac, slowly losing touch with reality as his own armies are hopelessly losing ground in the final days of fighting.  The story is based on accounts of people who actually witnessed these time and events, primarily one of Hitler's secretaries, a rather young and nave Traudl Junge, whom we see interviewed (the REAL Traudl Junge, not the actress who portrays her) at the beginning and conclusion of the film.

I was shocked to learn at the end of the film many of the characters we see portrayed in the movie, lived to a ripe old age in Germany.  Some not far from where I lived in Deutschland in the late 90's.

American author Kurt Vonnegut once asked some German friend of his what the defining trait of the German people was, to which the friend replied ""obedience.""  In ""Der Untergang"" we see up close and personal the consequences of such national fidelity to one individual (Hitler) and ideal (German superiority).  Even after Hitler has committed suicide, and Berlin is all but lost, the German characters are STILL arguing about following der Fhrer's last ""Befehl"" (command).

This isn't an uplifting film, but it is certainly an excellent film.  Anyone curious about WWII, war, insane human nature, and the even slightly-human portrayal of a detached, half-lit dictator should watch this film.  Again, Bruno Ganz's performance should have, hands-down, earned an oscar.  Hollyweed is dorked up not to have recognized this, but then Hollyweed's past track record already shows Hollyweed has frequently been dorked up.  Strong supporting performance from the rest of the German cast, and hats off to the folks who made this movie.  Having lived in Germany for 4 years, I know that for the national German psyche this is a delicate topic to tackle, and the makers of this film pulled it off with a deft touch that made it an effective examination, but which in no way ""honors"" its subject (Hitler).

It's amazing the number of people who can't stand reading subtitles, but this is DEFINITELY a movie worthy of seeing in its recorded language (German).  The impact of Hitler's tirades (and Ganz's performance) would be substantially lessened if dubbed into English.

Check this movie out...way worth the time 2.5 hours of your time.",1167264000,,2735,4.975824175824176
2151654,5,B0002Z16HY,"FIRST THOUGHTS ABOUT 'DOWNFALL': BEST FILM DEPICTING THE END OF THE THIRD REICH THAT I HAVE YET SEEN IS DONE SO WELL IT IS TRULY PAINFUL TO SEE

DOWNFALL is NOT a film you watch to quietly pass a few pleasant hours. In Downfall, the viewer has a front-row seat and there is much here one may not wish to see or to allow children to see. Essentially, this is gritty, harsh stuff depicting the end of the most tragic and convulsive period in history. That's right, Berlin during the last week of April, 1945 and, more specifically, in and around Hitler's bunker with Adolph Hitler as the central character.

IN A NUTSHELL -- DOWNFALL MAINTAINS AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRAGIC DESPERATION FOR 2.5 HOURS

Basically, everything that is depicted in this film has been documented and is true to historic fact, so there are no real surprises to anyone that has studied the Third Reich. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, the viewer is steeped in the tragic circumstances of the soon-to-be beaten Germans. Somehow, it seems very sad and pitiful. Hitler seems like a tragic figure, while Doctor and Frau Goebbels seem like the parents from a horror movie and their sweet, cute children don't know that their parents are the monsters. There is a whole subplot involving the final disposition of the Goebbels' children that might best be skipped over for some viewers. It is all quite true, but truly gruesome.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT -- HITLER'S GERMANY IS DISINTEGRATING & WE ALL HAVE FRONT ROW SEATS

The real question here is --- DO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT? Put simply, this film is an honest-to-goodness downer! If you are prone to feeling blue or miserable from witnessing human misery, you will feel pretty low after this. That's because this is both very realistic and based on historic fact so that, after the film, one cannot take comfort from the knowledge that this was only a movie. The truth is that this film gets as close to the truth as any has to date, but the actual gut-wrenching experience of being in Berlin during this final curtain call for the Third Reich is beyond description. Frankly, those that survived [and so many died horribly] like Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) were put into such a state of shock that they never recovered from the experience. Having Traudl Junge's experiences incorporated into the film as a viewpoint character adds perspective and humanizes this last week of the New Germany beyond where the historic source material, provided chiefly by Joachim C. Fest, could have taken it.

ABOUT BRUNO GANZ AS ADOLF HITLER:

Ganz gives the best rendition of Chancellor Hitler to date. He is a surprisingly-sympathetic character who is literally being buried alive by the weight of the calamities surrounding him. He appears to be poorly served by his inner circle who are waiting around for him to come up with some brillant master stroke to save everyone's bacon. Of course, Hitler knows he can't pull a rabbit out of his hat this time, and that fact is killing him right in front of our eyes. His coping skills fail him as he turns first on his followers and then the German people as a whole. Clearly, Hilter was pretty much losing his sanity at this point and everyone seemed to simply lean all the more on him as things grew darker. Small wonder he shot himself and took poison along with his new bride [she took only poison in order to avoid tarnishing her looks, before the petrol treatment, that is.]

PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT IS SHOWN IS HORRIBLE [ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE HORROR WAS NOT SHOWN]:

Yes, we see children being armed and then killed defending Berlin. We see the wounded and the civilians being pushed aside like fodder and we see the death of a great culture in Berlin itself. Throughout this film, one indeed gets the impression that it is far easier to destroy than to create. We see a lot of destruction and self-destruction, such as Germans executing their own people at the very end and then killing themselves. Generals of the Army [Jodl - Keitel] were later executed anyway at Nuremburg, so perhaps they had the right idea.

Bruno Ganz deserves an Academy Award and Alexandra Maria Lara and Julianne Kohler are true standouts. The casting and the acting in this film are first-rate and many of the characters (Joseph Goebells, in particular) bear uncanny resemblance to their true counterparts.

BOTTOM LINE: RAW HISTORY -- SORRY, NO HAPPY ENDINGS HERE

""Downfall' is a phenomenal film that uses the cold historic facts of sources like Joachim C. Fest's ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" to get the story correct. It then adds the additional humanizing effect of Traudl Junge's memoirs, which are effectively inserted into the film from its first scene until its last.

With its wonderful direction and effortless story telling `Downfall' delivers a tragic tale we don't all too often consider.  A lot of people have balked that this plays too much a sympathetic ear when considering the final days of Hitler's life, but it's that sympathy that we have yet to feel and so it's that key difference that stands this film apart from the rest as a landmark film in my eyes.

Powered of course by Bruno's forceful performance (complete with subtle conversation, extreme outbursts, ticks and physical transformation...I mean really the whole package) as the hated leader of the Third Reich, `Downfall' focuses on those final days as Hitler's mental state worsened and the very thought of surrender and or hostile takeover drove him to suicide.  `Downfall' to me is less like `American History X' and more like `United 93' in that we never once get the feeling like we're being coerced into believing his prejudice (was it just me or did Edward Norton's character start to make his point after a while) but more or less are just given their viewpoint, as wrong as it may be, without sugar coating or biased conversion.  Hitler is painted as Hitler, nothing more and certainly nothing less.  What I appreciated was that instead of creating this undeniably horrid man we are just given facts and interpretation is left solely to the viewer.

`Downfall' carries with it an epic feel and serves as a brilliant biopic upon all biopics.  With acting that surpasses most nominees that year; `Downfall' was sorely overlooked come the big race but deserves your consideration now.  Don't hesitate for fear you'll be shown a film bent of `humanizing' a monster, watch it for the sheer satisfaction that not all of Hollywood is bent on giving us stereotypes and thus they are willing to `humanize' him because as we should all know there is no such thing as monsters, just human-beings gone terribly wrong.",1165795200,,2055,4.848571428571429

Bruno's portrayal of Hitler is compelling, but the filmmakers, while showing a bit of his human side, errerd, I think in not showing either him at his most monstrous (only passing mention is made of the Jewish genocide), nor at his most charismatic.  We see him only at his sad end.

The real compelling story here is Eva Braun's.  I'd always pictured Eva as some sort of frumpy fraulein, captured by Hitler, who was kept as more of a pet than a lover.  But the Eva we see here is vivacious, kind, funloving, and is the one who provides ""sanity"" to those last days in the bunker.  Why was she loyal to Hitler?  We don't really get to know, but this portrayal of Hitler's woman is as good as the one of Churchill's wife in The Gathering Storm.

The definitive film biography of Hitler has yet to be done.  However, this film is a must-see for anyone interested in this era of history.",1163030400,,1343,4.436734693877551

Well, this film, and presumably the book, flesh out the psychological sate of paranoia surrounding the bunker in Berlin in ways I've not seen before. It's all a bit too staged and Hollywood theatrics for my tastes. Which is, given the the scenario we're witnessing, is probably sufficient endistancing to absorb the histrionics of the script. We need the apologies and explanations for redress: not just the Germans, but as another reviewer perspicaciously suggests, to  alert ourselves to similar susceptiblities within our own ranks and times. Bruno Ganz's Hitler is as good as the guy in Sokurov's, 'Moloch'. And the comparison stands for the Goering characters in both films. When Joseph Beuys and Anselm Kiefer sprung into gallery and periodical circulation in the last quarter on the C20th, the cultural world took note of Germans owning the menacing 1930s and 40s. They made brave and reparative art. The TV series,'Hamat' worked in the same vein. I don't consider this to work on the same aesthetic level as the aforementioned, but it is party to the same earnest rear vision, and that so much research could accessed through its participants, helps the authenticity of its outcome.",1162425600,,1278,5.056872037914692
2151661,5,B0002Z16HY,"Most films lose a lot of force if you know to much about the subject, this one is different. The more the viewer knows, the more horrifying the film becomes.

This film does not offer the traditional Hollywood relief that a bad guy knows he is a bad guy, has obvious evil traits, or of heroes that see through the disguise of the bad guy and give him his comeupance. No, by portraying Hiler as a man with emotions and positive (!) dreams, and his followers as just ordinary people, the film forces the viewer to accept that Hitler and his followers were not evil in the Hollywood sense, or similar to Shakespear's Richard III (who is physically deformed, and revels in his own wichedness). Instead, they are humans, and just show the ordinary human ability for pettiness and cruelty, and of kindness and compassion. I suppose this is one of the reasons this film did not really make it into the mainstream cinemas in the US: there are no heroes in the film we can look up to to solve our problems. In the end, the problem of evil is unsolved - the filmmakers do not even allow us to see the Hitler's body. A standard Hollywood trick to show that the person is not dead, but will reappear... there is no closure. The evil one can at any time appear among us again. No one has defeated Him, if he is dead, he took his own life. Junge, Schenck, Mohnke, Gunsche, Speer, and the other pov characters are little more than powerless spectators, relaying their observations to the moviegoer.

I think the start of the film is a bit shaky, but once Hitler accepts that everything is lost, it becomes monumental! A warning, be prepared for the gutwrenching sequence when Magda Goebbels poisons her children.

Another reason the film might not be so hot with mainstream cinemas is that it questions the leader's relation to his people. It is Goebbels, of all people! that summarizes the film when he says that the German people elected the nazis and kept them in power, now the Germans should not come whining when the game is lost.

No, the film does not answers any of the questions it raises. It does that deliberately. The viewers must find the answers themselves.",1161388800,4,2157,4.5372750642673525
2151662,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" is an intelligent, engrossing drama, and one that is sure to be a treat for history buffs, though ""treat"" might not be the right word in light of the grim proceedings on display.

There's really not much else I can add to the excellent customer reviews and comments here on Amazon, so I'll just say this: I didn't have any problem at all with Hitler being portrayed with a touch more humanity in this production than in many previous dramatizations of his life.  Showing Hitler being patient with his nervous secretary or having a quiet moment with his mistress or (to use the old cliche) being nice to his dog, doesn't mean the film makers are making excuses for Hitler or softening him.  Rather, such moments do just the opposite: they warn us that the horror of Hitler could rise up again in another human being who may at first glance seem like a regular person.

Portraying Hitler in a one-note lunatic fashion- as he's been portrayed often in the past- makes him less real and more like a cartoon villain that only achieved power as a fluke, and that's a dangerous idea.  No, I think the film makers made the right decision in making Hitler seem, at least somewhat, like a regular person.  And, besides, for those who prefer to see the crazy, ranting Hitler, not to worry: there's plenty of that here, too.

Now, whether the film makers gave a free pass to many of Hitler's supporters, many of whom are portrayed in the film as simply naive or just too weak or scared to resist, I don't know.  Certainly the film didn't give such a pass to everyone surrounding the man in the film.  Hitler is by no means the only figure in the film who radiates hate and evil.

In the final analysis, the important service this harrowing, often claustrophobic film provides surely outweighs any shortcomings it might have.  Also worth your time is the almost hour-long ""making of"" documentary that's also on the DVD.  It explores in detail many of the themes and topics discussed in these Amazon reviews, in particular why the actors felt it important to portray the historical figures as the figures likely saw themselves and not as they're seen today; and what the German film makers wanted to accomplish in making a film about Hitler at all.

This is a top-notch film, and a top-notch DVD, all around.",1161216000,3,2305,4.620098039215686
2151663,5,B0002Z16HY,"This movie deserves all of the accolades it has received both from the film industry and the reviewers who have written about it here. It's interesting, however, that people are so shocked at how Hitler and his henchmen managed to take over Germany and lead the world into a war that included the ultimate atrocity of the Holocaust. While anyone who is familiar with German history knows that the country was especially vulnerable to a charismatic, if obviously megalomaniacal, leader like Hitler, there were many other countries who followed such leaders in the twentieth century; Hitler simply managed to take his schemes to theretofore unreached heights before his (and Germany's) inevitable ""Downfall.""

As has been mentioned by other reviewers, Hitler is accurately portrayed as a human being in this film rather than as a stereotyped demonic figure. Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Goering, and their ilk were indeed human, and they were also products of a society that had come to embrace social Darwinism and Nietzschean nihilism. Only the strong should survive and those strong survivors would then become gods. When one follows such a line of thinking and believes that, as Nietzsche wrote, ""God is dead,"" then no evil is out of the realm of possibility.

Once the influence of such schools of thought resulted in God's 'death' to most of the European (not only German) population, a man like Hitler had an easy task of promoting his agenda of a race of supermen. The German masses went along with him as he restored both their national pride and economy (even if it was accomplished primarily through military build-up). Once he appeared as though he was the people's savior, he had them swear their allegiance to him (as though he were indeed their Lord and savior). Of course, by this time Hitler's power was established and anyone who didn't pledge their allegiance to him was eliminated or, at best, imprisoned. All of the suicides that viewers witness in this film were committed by fanatical followers who obviously thought of Hitler as their Messiah and didn't know what to do now that he had been revealed as being false. Other blind followers, like Traudl Junge, didn't have any ideas with which to arm themselves other than those implanted in them by Nazi brainwashers such as Goebbels.

Most of the German church stood idly by, although there were a very few noted figures - such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer - who did resist Hitler, because most of the German people had long ago lost interest in God. Even most of those who attended church did so out of custom rather than faith; they were firm nationalists and nominal Christians only.

I'm sure that a review such as this one, which approaches the situation from a Christian perspective, will be lambasted by many as being simplistic. I am also aware of the atrocities that have been, and continue to be, perpetrated in the name of both Christianity and other religions. I can't vouch for the other religions, but the atrocities committed in the name of Christianity have not come at the hands of true followers of the Christian faith.

For anyone who is interested in exploring these issues further, I recommend the following works as a starting point: 1) for a look at how Hitler actually exploited, and later subdued, the German church, read Erwin W. Lutzer's book titled ""Hitler's Cross""; 2) for a look at the foremost Church resistance leader, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and the dilemmas of faith and ethics which he had to confront under Hitler's regime, watch the DVD titled ""Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace""; 3) for a good sampler of Nietzschean nihilism, try ""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" ""The Anti-Christ,"" or ""Beyond Good and Evil"" (Hitler did twist some of Nietzsche's ideas a bit, but he didn't have to overexert himself in this process); and 4) for the answer to how a Hitler could have arisen in the first place (and why so many other brutal dictators ruled during the twentieth century and continue to arise in the twenty-first century), read Ravi Zacharias's excellent book titled ""Can Man Live Without God?"" (all are available on Amazon).",1160956800,5,4106,4.936324167872648
2151664,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2004

Downfall is that rarest of birds, a movie that actually lives up to all the hype. It is a depiction of the final days of the Third Reich from the perspective of Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara, as yet unknown to American audiences-- that will change soon), Hitler's secretary. Based on Junge's own memoirs and Joachim Fest's Der Untergang, Downfall shows a quick scene of Hitler interviewing Junge for the job, and then cuts to April of 1945, when everyone involved knows that no matter what happens, this will end badly. The film is for all intents and purposes plotless; Hirschbiegel is simply interested in exploring the different ways in which the characters are reacting to the stress of the imminent loss of the war. Hitler (peerlessly depicted by the great Bruno Ganz; this performance should have nabbed him an Oscar) gets sicker and more frail before our very eyes, while Eva Braun (Nowhere in Africa's Juliane Kohler) tries to keep up a happy-go-lucky air. Traudl and her friend Gerda (Perfume's Birgit Minichmayr) just try to muddle along. Schenk, an SS doctor (The Experiment's Christian Berkel, who also turns in an absolutely stunning performance) vacillates between simply trying to do his job and trying to talk sense into the other officers, who are doing their best Brownian motion impersionations, while the enlisted officers are separating into groups who do nothing but drink heavily and reminisce and those who become more fanatical by the day. There is a deep sense of nihlism about the whole affair-- it's Nero's Rome without the fiddling.

It seemed to me while I was watching the movie that what made it truly great was that it did not end with the death of Hitler himself; the film continues for another forty minutes, getting more and more grim every second, as the Russians take over the last holdouts in Berlin and what would have been minor characters in most movies are allowed the full dignity of having their loose ends tied up. The darkness of this picture is relentless, from the literal darkness of the first scene-- Hitler interviewed for secretaries, it seems, in the middle of the night-- to the existential darkness of the long, brutal denouement. There is not one shred of hope to be found here, only fleeting, and spurious, happiness. And yet these characters go on, and the actors who play them play them going on exceptionally well. Hirschbiegel directs them going on, and does it in such a way that we can't help but feel the most sympathy for the greatest monsters-- who were, after all, human beings. Vastly misguided ones, perhaps, but in the end, they are us, just as the millions who died under them are us. Hirschbiegel never lets us forget that, and in doing so has made, as one critic trumpeted, perhaps one of the finest war films of all time. **** ",1160956800,,2845,4.825819672131147

Furthermore the actors who play the key roles, especially Hitler, but also Goebbels, Speer, Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie.

What sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.  What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine.  Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama.  The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin.

As good as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were, this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over-acted.

2151666,5,B0002Z16HY,"Ever since ""Saving Private Ryan"" came out, there has been a rebirth in the World War II movie craze.  But this film, by far, is the best ever created.  There is no other movie more accurate or compelling as this movie.  From the scene of Hitler giving a metal to a Hitler Youth tank buster (taken and recreated from actual footage during Hitler's last days) to Adolf's withering health and appearance as the largest war in history came to a close.  No other movie can opitmize the destruction that this war caused.  No other movie has hosted a better actor to illustrate Hitler's speech patterns, gestures, voice, and fantasies for a reich built on blood and oil.  This movie truly places a face on the man who industrialized murder.  A prominent scene that illustrates this, I believe, is when Hitler is looking at a model of what was suppose to be the capitol building of Germania--a symbol of the thousand year reich.  Such a longing this failed artist had to leave his mark on history like that of Napolean Bonaparte or the Prussian King Frederick the Great.  This dream for Germania (Berlin), however, was reduced to mere rubble as the film portrays throughout the times outside Hitler's bunker.  By the end of the movie, top military officers are betraying their furher while he makes plans for suicide.  After such an event, the rest that remains of the reich also contemplate suicide rather than face the judgement of a war ravaged Soviet army.  Films of World War II will always come and go, but nothing compares to Downfall.

And all of this was made possible by one man who managed to weave a sense of fantasy and fanatism among the thinking pattern of the German nation to make them believe in him.

Being an avid movie lover, what makes a good movie for me is the whole package. ""Downfall"" is excellently executed through the cinematography, story line and sticking as close as possible to the actual events.

But what facinated me the most was that this movie enables a person in some way or the other to look at the movie and imagine oneself being in the bunker during those last 10 days as if being part of the ""tragedy"" that is unfolding.

For some historians, one can only imagine what those people, especially Hitler did until the day he killed him self. For some people, getting closer to the facts, in a way, quenches their thirst for finding the truth in order to make their own conclusions.

I don't support the actions that Hitler has actioned but looking at why he did it and how he did it, makes you understand why the War happened that could eventually prevent future horrors like this from happening. Sadly, that is not always the case.

I would love to see more movies like this being made on villians such as Napoleon, Mussolini, Lenin, etc, not to idolize them but to understand why they did what they did.

Bruno Ganz (a Swiss born actor) does an excellent interpretation of the unravelling Hitler - not a parody - but a very realistic interpretation of the megalomaniac living in a dream world of phantom army divisions as the ""Thousand-Year"" Reich crumbles around him.

2151670,5,B0002Z16HY,"DOWNFALL is possibly the best German-language film I have ever seen about the Second World War. It sets a new and impressive standard that will be very hard to beat and serves notice on hack film-makers everywhere that depicting historical figures as cartoon images of good or evil is no longer acceptable with the modern audience.

There have been a number of films and programs over the years about Hitler's last days on earth, and if you watched DOWNFALL, you've probably seen one or more them. They vary widely in quality, but the performance which pops into my mind most readily is that of Stephen Berkoff in the 12-part ""War & Remembrance"" mini-series. Berkoff is a fine actor, but he was handcuffed to a script which was predicated on the false image of Hitler as a carpet-chewing lunatic who reacted to the slightest setback by throwing a screaming fit and ordering someone shot. This image was partially an echo of wartime propaganda, and partly stemmed from books penned by surviving generals who wanted to lay the blame for the war's defeat exclusively at Hitler's boots. A more accurate description of the man came from Albert Speer, who said ""Hitler was a genius wrestling with a demon, and the demon won.""

This image is precisely the one conveyed by veteran Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler as a man who in private often took on the role of a kindly, absent-minded professor-grandpa, but when frustrated, thwarted or betrayed (as he frequently was in the last months of his life) showed an inner character reminiscent of a hateful child -- full of misanthropy and an arrogant kind of self-pity. Ganz's performance is simply epic. And when does finally throw the ""Hitler tantrum"" you know is coming, you can't take your eyes off the man. Wow.

The decision to depict Hitler as a human being will clearly irritate people who prefer to see him as Satan incarnate. The NEW YORKER review posted here is visible evidence of this, stating: ""The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always been morally and imaginatively questionable-a compromise with the unspeakable that borders on complicity with it."" Thankfully, Hirschbiegel and Ganz paid no mind to this type of simple-minded drivel when they made the film. They understood, as the audience does, that to demonize Hitler lets humanity off the hook for producing him in the first place.

Thomas Kretschmann (as SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein) is another scene-stealer. Kretschmann portrays the handsome, oily opportunist who married Eva Braun's sister and used his SS rank as a license to amass a criminal fortune as a dyed-in-the-wool bastard who is as charming as they come -- just the type of cynical crook that flourished in the moral wasteland that the Third Reich ultimately became, and just the type that was first to jump ship when it all went south.

Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, is played ably by lovely Alexandra Maria Lara. Like many people around Hitler, she seemed to be unable to form a consistent opinion of him and her inner conflict is well conveyed on the screen. Other terrific performances are delivered by Corinna Harfouch (as creepy Magda Goebbels), Juliane K&ouml;hler (as the very likeable Eva Braun), Christian Berkel (as Prof. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nter Schenck, a kindly and heroic SS doctor), Michael Mendl (General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling, a true soldier in the old German mold, who responds to a threat to have him shot by grasping his Knight's Cross and snarling, ""Do you see this? Don't you dare take that tone with me!"", and sinister nebbish Ulrich Noethen as the back-stabbing Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler. There is also a fine turn by G&ouml;tz Otto as Hitler's SS Adjutant, Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Otto G&uuml;nsche, a hulking brute of a man who serves as a two-legged counterpart to Hitler's faithful dog, Blondi.

Unlike some German war films I've seen, DOWNFALL's battle scenes are well-directed, and the technical execution of the film is superb. The movie is mercifully light on moralizing, letting the horrifying images on the screen speak for themselves. I have very few criticisms of the film. The interview scenes with the real Traudl Junge, who dutifilly condemns herself for getting involved with Hitler, seem tacked-on, forced, and generally PC. The battle scenes show nothing of the wonton rape committed by Soviet soldiers in Berlin (so many German women were raped that East Berliners later dubbed the statue put up there by communist authorities commemorating Soviet dead as ""the tomb of the unknown rapist""). And the movie is about 15 - 20 minutes too long. But these are very minor points. In DOWNFALL, Oliver Hirschbiegel has directed a film that stands comfortably with the best WW 2 movies of all time.

2151672,5,B0002Z16HY,"I am generally bored and fed up with WWII movies, because all of them are about the same thing. Watching one of them is like watching all of them. But this was one of those rare movies that I watched twice back to back.

This movie is totally different. It is not about WWII or Germans or allied forces or a lesson in history or any of Hollywood-like heroic depictions. It is just a movie about Hitler's life and personality during his last 10 days before Berlin fell, how he led the army, talked to people, ate, how he got married and how he made the decision to die. It is not a propaganda. It does not try to clear Hitler or convict him. You are allowed to judge for yourself, unlike many other movies that are clearly biased to each side.

I think most of the people in the movie play their roles superbly. I could hardly doubt that the guy playing Hitler is actually playing a role (and that's a difficult role to play). Actors are made to look as much as possibly like the person they represent. So it is more like bringing those people to life. The movie is about Hitler's interaction with his environment, his secretary (whose narrative is the basis for the movie), his commanders and generals. At the same time the movie has a second stage which is the war itself and how Hitler's youth and German soldiers were defending Berlin against Russion forces in the last days before their surrender. The movie switches between Hitler's intimate circle and the Berlin defence several times during the movie and makes a very meaningful and compelling connection.

In general, I think everyone must see this movie. It is not just another WWII movie; it is an unbiased lesson on Hitler's life and behavior.",1155945600,7,1704,4.525974025974026
2151673,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" is easily one of the best historical films I have seen in a long time. The film is insightful, bold, creative, and fascinating, but in a manner devoid of any sentiment or sensationalism. Its style is one of `realism' and despite the problems that can so easily arise when art attempts to be `real', ""Downfall"" manages to come across as brutally honest in all that it attempts. The fact that the film is German only heightens my respect for it and makes me wish that those of us in North America could be half as honest and plain spoken of our own checkered past. Some may be turned away by the length of the film (around three hours) or by its subtitles (although such misapprehensions need hardly be pandered too), but I assure all that the film never drags, never wastes a scene or a moment, and handles its subject with a level of talent and maturity rarely seen in film.

It takes a certain amount of skill to adequately handle the tricky job of attempting to take history and make cinematic fiction of it, and this film has more than its fair share. The direction is precise and focused, and the acting simply superb. Especially good is Alexandra Maria Lara as Hitler's personal secretary. Her character begins as a nave outsider, in awe of Hitler as a figure of power, only to end as confused and torn as so many of the others: loyal still to the man himself, and yet repulsed and left lost by the raving figure he has become. The film is interested is depicting the ways in which those closest to Hitler negotiated his overbearing presence, and it is through Maria Lara that we see how complicated this balance could be. Hitler himself is played brilliantly by Bruno Ganz, who expertly handles Hitler's role in the film, which is complex and subtle in so many remarkable ways. Hitler is at this point in 1945 losing control, both of his ferocious personality and the situation he has created. The man himself is now beyond repair and it is more his ideas, and the way in which the other characters react to them, that is the focus of the film. Ganz understands this and instead of overplaying this so easily overplayed character, he understates the role in such subtle ways as to render him almost irrelevant to the situation. Hitler is a ghost in the film, an empty shell even before his body is burned, and for the filmmakers and Ganz to recognize and so aptly employ this approach is one of their greatest triumphs.

A question that kept coming to me while watching ""Downfall"" was: what is the point of the film? Why make it? Is it meant to be a record of history, and, if so, to what end? I believe this is an important question of any film that claims ties to history. I am always somewhat skeptical of historical films in general, as they tend to oversimplify or give too much validity to a notion of progressive history, and end up compromising any mature notions of the complexity and fluidity of history for the sake of storytelling. ""Downfall"" certainly works hard to be as accurate an account of the last days of the Third Reich as possible, but still seems to recognize its limitations as a fictional and artistic rendering of an actual place and time in history, and of the idea of `history' itself. It strives to reduce all sensationalism and myth and to instead focus on depicting its characters and story with an appropriate amount of careful insight. The film is more an example of historical theory than fact, and uses its own artistic approach to history in a way that never seems inappropriate in its claims to realism. There is a warning within the film, to be sure, of fanaticism and its extremes, but it never comes across as preachy or false, and is presented in a subtle enough fashion to make it ultimately rewarding to reveal.

""Downfall"" is great both as an exercise in cinematic history, and as a work of cinema itself. So many of its scenes are so rich is meaning and effect that one cannot begin to do them justice in a review, but let it be said that scenes such as the murder of Goebbel's children and the depraved Romanesque `parties' of Eva Braun are among the most memorable of recent years. I hate to gush this way over a film, and I hate also to fall into the trap of praising anything which happens to be foreign, but try as I might I can say no ill word against this finely crafted film. Perhaps the most critical thing I can say is that it all too clearly shows the failures of so many other films of its type and puts to shame such North American dreck as the recent ""Hitler: Rise to Evil"". I hope to see many more films in the recent future with as much maturity in their approach to history as ""Downfall"".",1155859200,8,4667,4.475352112676056

I thought Downfall showed a lot of attention to detail and I was very happy to see this approached from a German viewpoint since the other two films used British actors (I saw Guinness, have not seen Hopkins, I prefer to see my Hitler's as insane madmen like the one Guinness portrayed than Ganz's weak old man). I was less drawn into the movie by the main character as I was interested in the supporting players and especially those outside the bunker, talk about your chaotic times. Why I'm not totally in love with this film like 95% of the others who saw it is that it seems apologetic to Hitler, like he WAS let down by his generals. I also would have enjoyed it much more if ONE scene showed Hitler in an unfavorable light but he seems to garner sympathy throughout the film. My final nail in this revisionist portrayal is even during Hitler's suicide it is done with grace not showing any of the reality, not even a dead body scene. It just seemed way too kind on the man who single handedly enabled the slaughter of millions upon millions of people.",1155427200,,1200,4.314159292035399

We also see, as Traudl Junge aptly portrays, the dichotomy of the still first class surroundings under the bunker, and the hell that was being lived above ground.  An excellent movie -- highly recommended.",1155081600,,415,4.657534246575342
2151677,5,B0002Z16HY,"This superb film allows the viewer to watch history unfold and Adolph Hitler unravel in his bunker as the Second World War, turns against the Third Reich and Nazi Germany. As a result the German people reap the hate-filled whirl-wind Hitler and the Wehrmacht had sown in Soviet Russia and Europe.

""Downfall"" is not only true to the book on which it is based, but is also well acted, with a supporting cast that closely resemble the Nazi leaders which they play (Martin Borman, Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler and Albert Speer). When this film opened in Germany, which is still uncomfortable with accepting its Nazi past, it caused a sensation.

The publication of the once secret ""Hitler Book,"" commissioned by Joseph Stalin, based on interrogations with Hitler's personal staff, and recently translated and published, supports the accuracy of this depiction of the German Fuehrer's last days and his suicide.

The film moves quickly from the surreal world of Hitler's bunker and his entourage to developments in Berlin, where the population must face both the attacking Red Army and the rampaging SS, bent on hanging any man not taking up a weapon. Even children, indoctrinated as Hitler Youth, are thrown against the Soviets in a futile attempt to stop their advance.

The story is told from the perspective of Hitler's young secretary, Traudl Junge, who joined the German leader in 1942. Incredible thought is seems, she survived Hitler's downfall, unlike many of her colleagues, breaking out of the bunker and eventually making her way out of Berlin through the Red Army.

Those unfamiliar with the end of Hitler and his Third Reich in Berlin in 1945 will find a powerful and compelling story here. That the film opens and ends with the reflections of the real Traudl Junge only adds to its authenticity.",1154908800,2,1828,5.0
2151678,4,B0002Z16HY,Excellent! Sometimes confusing by insufficient identification of individual characters.  No cast which actor/actress is playing whom.,1153872000,,133,7.3125
2151679,4,B0002Z16HY,"Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun.  A few years back, a documentary entitled ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life.  ""Downfall"" is a dramatized account of what she saw.

Indeed, this new film begins and ends with clips from that earlier work, in which a now aged Traudl Junge attempts to explain why she allowed herself to become a devotee of both Hitler and the Nazi party (she chalks it up, basically, to ""curiosity"").  After that brief preamble, ""Downfall"" plunges us immediately into that hellish time when the world lay in ruins and The Third Reich was breathing its long overdue final gasp.

The beauty of ""Downfall"" is not merely that it affords us a glimpse into one of the most fascinating bits of 20th Century history, but that it opens up aspects of human nature that we may not always wish to acknowledge.  It shows Hitler as a man accustomed to being able to control events and the people around him suddenly rendered impotent in the face of a force - in this case the Russian army battering away at Germany's capital city - greater than himself.  As events spiral more and more out of control, the dictator becomes ever more paranoid and divorced from reality (by the end he's issuing orders to an army that , quite literally, no longer exists).  For him, the world suddenly divides itself up into those who will remain loyal and faithful to the bitter end and those who will become traitors both to him and to the ""glorious cause"" that defined their lives for so many years.  For one thing the movie is clear to acknowledge is that, even in his final moments, Hitler remains unrepentant and convinced that not only was he right in what he did, but that future generations would come to recognize that rightness and honor him for it.  In many ways, this is the story of any failed dictator whose dreams of worldwide domination end in the smoldering ruins of his own hubris.

But it is not merely Hitler who exhibits bizarre behavior in the face of onrushing doom.  Even though most of the people who have chosen to remain in the bunker with their leader are fully aware of the fate that awaits them, they maintain many of the rituals and accoutrements of ""civilized,"" ""gracious"" living: they hold dances, sing patriotic songs, drink champagne from crystal glasses, read magazines, all the while calmly discussing the ideal way to kill themselves.  Despite their fear, they are so caught up in the vision and the man to whom they have sworn allegiance that they are willing to die - and take their children with them into death - rather than live in a world without their beloved Fuehrer.

The makers of ""Downfall"" run the risk common to any work that attempts to provide a three-dimensional portrait of Hitler: the accusation that they are trying to ""humanize""  a man whose epic disregard for human life puts him in the category of the greatest monsters who ever lived.  And, indeed, the movie does show Hitler displaying moments of warmth and tenderness, mainly aimed towards the women in his life (and, of course, his dog).  Yet, who among us really believes that Hitler NEVER showed affection to those who were close to him?  It was the fact that he COULD treat the people he loved in this way yet was unable to extend that same sense of empathy and concern to the faceless, nameless millions he slaughtered that made him the true incarnation of evil on earth.

The film also does a great job showing the varied reaction of Hitler's military commanders as they argue back and forth over whether to level with him about the hopelessness of the situation and thereby risk incurring his wrath or to continue to feed his delusions and let him go out thinking he was still master of his fate.

The performances are all first rate, but I would like to single out especially the lively and vivacious Juliane Kohler who manages to make Eva Braun's blind devotion to a murderous madman and fearlessness in the face of death touching, understandable, and - dare I say it? - strangely heroic.  As Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara shrewdly portrays a woman whose own devotion to the man and the cause is tempered by a certain degree of rationality and fear, to the point where she can ask, in a moment of candor, how Hitler can be so kind on a personal level, yet so brutal in his comments and actions.  And, of course, Bruno Ganz gives a bravura performance as Hitler, running the gamut from full-throttle mania to tender solicitude while never losing sight of the man at the core.

Although the vast majority of the scenes are set inside the bunker, writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel take us outside to see the devastating effect this war is having on the innocent civilians caught up in it.  Thus, while the focus is tight, the tapestry on which the film plays out is broad and large.

Despite being set in the past, ""Downfall"" has a great deal of relevance to our own time.  To see Magda Goebbels methodically and systematically poisoning each one of her own children before having herself killed is to understand a little better how family men can fly planes filled with innocent men, women and children into skyscrapers.  It's a scary and sobering sight indeed.  Now if only we as a species could learn some of the lessons put forth by this film.",1153699200,,5617,4.6237424547283705

2151681,5,B0002Z16HY,"Very realistic film portraying Hitler's last weeks in the bunker, surrounded by the last of his loyal followers. This really shows how Hitler went basically a bit bonkers toward the bitter end. His physical statue declines along with his mental state. His desire to have all of Germany destroyed along with the german People rather than surrender still comes as a shocker. It shows the Man's true colors! He then bows out to spare himself from the wrath of the enemy, leaving others to hold the ball. What a peach!",1152489600,,514,4.722222222222222
2151682,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is an exceptional film that offers a very realistic view of the mental character of Adolph Hitler in the final 10 days of World War II. There were three basic plot lines that the writers and director developed; the collapse of the city of Berlin, the mental breakdown and suicide of Adolph Hitler, and the poisoning of the Goebbels children by their mother Magda.

It is the invasion, destruction and collapse of Berlin that remains the constant background to all of the action in the bunker. We see step by step the advancement of the Russians, the despair of the Berlin citizens, and the vigilante groups killing suspected collaborators and deserters. I found the German generals, soldiers, physicians, to be portraits of ordinary and brave humans who are contrasted against the insanity of Hitler. Hitler's belief system would never allow him to take responsibilities for any of his mistakes or actions, but to always project paranoia and blame outward. He repeatedly made decisions that cost thousands of civilian and military lives because he saw the people and military of Germany had betrayed him by losing the war and must now be wiped out. As Hitler's empire crumbles he congratulates himself for at least almost exterminating the Jews of Western Europe.

Magda Goebbels thought that the world would not be a fit place to live if National Socialism was extinquished and thus she kills her beautiful children in the bunker. This part of the movie is so creepy that it almost detracts from the fantastic battles in the streets of Berlin and the outrageous outbursts of temper from Hitler to his staff and generals. Magda Goebbels competes for craziness with Hitler in the film - which may be the films one flaw.

Albert Speer is played superbly by an actor that strongly resembles Speer. Speer's last scene with Hitler is so telling as Speer admits to Hitler that he has not been destroying Germany's industrial and transportation infrastructure as Hitler ordered because he knew the German people would need such a system to emerge from the rubble. Hitler would have killed Speer if he had known this. Speer offers his hand to Hitler, but Hitler refuses to shake it or look at Speer again.

The story is presented through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was present during the entire last 10 days in the bunker. Thankfully she survived and was able to tell the details of all the final pathology in Hitler's last days. This film is a classic already.",1152230400,4,2481,4.858156028368795
2151683,5,B0002Z16HY,"Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler is incredible. It is not so much his appearance as Hitler, but rather his three-dimensional interpretation of him. Drawing from tapes of Hitler, Ganz captures his cadence and dialect mixed with standard German to perfection. He mimics Hitler's symptoms of Parkinson's and his behavioural traits with equal aplomb.

This is due also to Traudl Junge's eye-witness account from her book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Until-the-Final-Hour-Hitler-s-Last-Secretary/dp/1559707283/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary</a>&nbsp;about Hitler and his last days in the Berlin Bunker with some of the Nazi party's upper echelon. As one of Hitler's secretaries, ""Downfall""  is as much Junge's story as it is a glimpse into the charisma and power Hitler wielded in the last days of the Third Reich, even after his suicide.

While some have tagged this film a 'humanised' view of Hitler, it is a safe bet people in Nazi Germany were deceived for this very reason. Surely a person who is perceived to be -- as Hilter is depicted in this film -- the kindly uncle to children, the considerate boss to the secretary and the gentle dog owner is more likely to be trusted than the caricature of a constantly raging lunatic or buffoon. What could be a more convincing persona for committing monstrous acts?

The film in no way glorifies Hitler or Nazism. His (their) anti-Semitic and racist statements, contempt for the German people's inability to achieve victory and debauchery in the bunker while teenagers, the invalid, the elderly and a ragtag German army struggled for survival above certainly do not endear one to the ideology they espoused. If anything, one is actually more inclined to feel sympathy for the millions of victims caught in his (their) web of deceit, hate and utter absurdity.

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Das-Boot-The-Director-s-Cut/dp/0767802470/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Das Boot - The Director's Cut</a>, it is a dark and claustrophobic film. You get the feeling of what it was like inside the bunker and around a bomb-scarred Berlin. One of the most disturbing and hardest scenes to watch is Magda Goebbels methodically poisoning her six children. Just as shocking are the suicides, either by gun, grenade, hanging or cyanide.

Interestingly, the movie was filmed is St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of the buildings and streets shown in the film resemble Berlin before the war, largely because they were designed by German architects. The structures were also devoid of advertising billboards and signage.  Symbolic or not, it was a tremendous gesture of goodwill and reconciliation for Germans and Russians to work together on this film, considering the brutality and suffering each inflicted upon the other during WWII.

""The Pianist"" a very close second.  ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" not on the list... sorry, Speilberg.

Like ""The Pianist"", This movie has less action, more humanity.  I am convinced that Bruno Ganz WAS Hitler in this film.  But dare I say... I was actually pulling for Hitler and the Nazi's?  This film shows that though they were monsters, they were humans as well.  Hitler was still a madman up until the end, but still seemed to have a sliver of humanity for the people closest to him.  One can imagine how frightening it would be to have to live in a depressing bunker such as that.  As the allies grow closer and closer, there is less and less hope.  You almost hope they re-write history and make it out okay.  All the performances are stellar and convincing, the cinematography is beautiful, and I tip my hat to the director (Oliver Hirschbiegel)

2151693,5,B0002Z16HY,"_Downfall_ is a film which depicts the last days of the Third Reich as Hitler and his cronies await their imminent doom in their bunker as the Russians invade Berlin.  Hitler is depicted by Bruno Ganz as suffering from Parkinsonianism and slowly losing his grip on reality, ranting and raving about the failure of the German people and the German generals and military as it becomes more and more apparent that he has lost the war.  The film is interesting in that it also shows a more personable side to Hitler, an ambiguous figure in the film, capable at once of kindness towards his secretaries and his dog but also great cruelty.  However, one also becomes aware of the ultimate failure of the Third Reich, as one sees how the cult of personality surrounding Hitler fails to serve the German people as innocent German civilians are slaughtered by the Red army.  Many of the most loyal in Hitler's regime choose to fight to the end and ultimately commit suicide (serving as would be martyrs of the National Socialist political religion).  Goring, Speer, and Himmler all ultimately opt to attempt to save their own lives by betraying Hitler.  Goebbels remains loyal to the end and he and his wife murder their own children, in the most sickening of manners, and then commit suicide because they cannot bear a world without National Socialism.  Eva Braun too remains loyal to Der Furher, opting to commit suicide with him by cyanide capsule after their marriage in the bunker.  (According to the film, Hitler's body was burned following his suicide so as to never be found by the invading Russians.  The film does not give credit to many of the various survival myths or alternative accounts of Hitler's last days.)  The movie speaks to the horrors of war, and also the cruelty of men, showing the insane cruelty of the Nazi regime and the SS, but also hinting at the equal cruelty of the Soviet army.  The movie also speaks to the dangers of fanaticism, showing the way in which many of Hitler's own men obediently followed his every order unto their very death.  It should be noted that Hitler had a lifelong fascination with suicide and that several of his former mistresses had committed suicide over him.  The unquestioning nature of Hitler's associates is particularly shocking to see depicted on film, although many would break with him and betray him, it becomes clear in the film who constituted the opportunists in the Nazi regime and who constituted the true believers.  Also, the conflict between Hitler and his generals and the military became very pronounced as Hitler ultimately turned his back on them and the German people but insisted at the same time that they never surrender.  I found this movie to be very disturbing, although no doubt a more accurate depiction of Hitler's ambiguous nature than much of the over-the-top pro-Allied propaganda.  While Hitler is depicted as clearly insane (or becoming insane) he is also clearly depicted as a human being and not merely a demon spawn conjured up from the pits of hell.  Ultimately however, while the Third Reich regime was a failure, its memory has lived on due both to its insane cruelty and to the role of war in shaping the Twentieth century.

His moral veneer reflecting a kindly, dog-loving, vegitarian steward of the Reich gives way to a misanthropic rage. The film illustrates well that Hitler was a pathological incompetent whose appeal to the German mob fed on their bigotry and ignorance as well as on jingoism. But Hitler's megalomaniacal personna is only one aspect of this amazing production. From Magda Goebbels's ineffable cruelty in murdering her children to the routine use of brainwashed kids to resist the tide of the Soviet advance, this film captures the possibility of moral chaos lurking just beneath the manicured surface of a civilization.

Eventually, Traudl will follow the Reich leadership into the Fuhrer bunker and observe the agonizing disintegration of the nation.  Here we meet the monsters both well known and less-so - from Hitler & Goering to men like Krebs, Jodl & Hanna Reitsch.  As the Red Army closes in on Berlin, the Reich leadership barks orders both purposeless and impossible - with non-existent combat units capable only of delaying the inevitable.  Eveyrbody knows what happened next - in high spirits, the occupants of the bunker kick off a suicidal orgy of cyanide capsules and 9mm bullets.  Magda Goebbels, traumatized by the end of Hitler (more than the collapse of the world around the two of them) murders all of her children.  On the surface, in bombed-out Berlin, those who neither fight nor commit suicide, are murdered as Bolshevik collaborators or defeatists.  Eventually, some will escape the Bunker - but must face vigilante Waffen-SS troops ready to kill any who would turn their weapons over to the Russian invaders.  Never far from either the proceedings above or below, is Der Fuhrer himself - as acted by Bruna Ganz, even after he's committed suicide, he still has a presence.

""Downfall"" takes a third path from those normally used to chart the end of last century's monster.  Making the Nazis into monsters doesn't quite cut it - they were men who had the opportunity not to commit monstrosity, why deny them that one shred of humanity that condemns them the most?  At the same time, humanizing the monster in the context of a 2-hour movie that doesn't begin to chart their atrocities risks downplaying those atrocities.  Instead, ""Downfall"" measures the evil of the Nazis by depicting the ends they will go to avoid having to face the consequences of their evil.  With their Walther pistols and their cyanide capsules, they gleefully end their lives confident that the rest of us will see valor, and not the shame of defeat, or their fear of years of Soviet captivity.  Ganz, as Hitler, best emphasizes this - by making sure that scenes of him suffering shame, terror and Parkinsons are balanced by scenes of him demonstrating unregenerate fascism to the end: giving orders even he can't believe, making pronouncements right out of Mein Kampf, abandoning his people by committing suicide.  We're led to believe that Hitler's end was marked by his own suffering and that of others, but ""Downfall"" confirms that he callously ignored the one to inflict the other on those he hated.  The rest of the performances are also nuanced - the script gets us terribly interested in people who - for all we know - will probably blow their brains out at any moment.

If the story has one flaw - moral or dramatic - it's the recurring focus on Traudl.  Though obviously loyal to an evil cause, Traudl herself is not really evil, and ""Downfall"" is willing to make Traudl more a victim than victimizer of that loyalty even if none of us are willing to do the same.",1146355200,6,3191,4.811355311355311
2151703,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a terrific movie, one of the most historically accurate movies ever made about Hitler's final days.  Just the fact that Hitler is finally seen ranting and raving in the original German (instead of the usual British accent in three other movie versions of Hitler's final days) really clinches the realism  - there is nothing like the crisply harsh and guttural German language to give emphasis to what Hitler must have been really like.  Bruno Ganz gives an incredible performance as Hitler.

In the final credits of the movie, the filmmakers name two books as the source material for this movie: ""Until the Final Hour"" and ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"".  I think they did this because the authors of both books were German, and the filmmakers wanted this to be a wholly German inspired film.

It is apparent as we watch this movie that the final days of Hitler are shown from the viewpoints of a short list of eyewitnesses.  And so the viewpoint of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, in this movie is indeed derived from her book ""Until the Final Hour"".

However, as noted by a reviewer for the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"", Joachim Fest's book has little to do with this movie.  Fest published his book in 2004, long after most of the principle sources for the history of the final days of Hitler had died, and could not have put together such a detailed account from first hand interviews.

Instead, that job had been accomplished by James O'Donnell, who located over 250 eyewitnesses to Hitler's final days, and communicated with over 100, and interviewed about 50.  He did this in the 1970's, and published ""The Bunker"" in 1978, while these witnesses were still alive.  Once you read this book, it is easy to identify the eyewitness accounts described by O'Donnell in this movie - they include vignettes taken from his interviews of Albert Speer, Dr. Schenck, General Mohnke, Otto Guensche, and Rochus Misch.

Many of the stories in this movie seem so surreal, absurd, and over the top that initially they felt like the products of an overly imaginative screenwriter.  However, read ""The Bunker"", and you find out that even more crazy things happened, and were left out by the filmmakers.

For example, General Fegelein was not just roaring drunk at his arrest, he was so uncontrollably and obscenely drunk that General Mohnke refused to continue with his court-martial, and so instead Fegelein was hauled off by the Gestapo and executed, probably in a cellar.  O'Donnell also speculates that the womanizing Fegelein may have been the dupe of a female British spy.

Traudl Junge and Gerda Christian were both raped by Russian soldiers during their escape from Berlin, a fact mentioned by O'Donnell and left out of both the movie and Junge's book.  Current German-Russian political sensitivities undoubtedly played a role (this movie was ironically filmed in St. Petersburg, the former Leningrad).

As O'Donnell's book points out, the eyewitness accounts frequently differed on how certain events transpired.  On a few occasions, the movie's choice of depiction of certain events contradict other, more reliable eyewitness accounts.  O'Donnell's book does an excellent job of sorting all of these possibilities out.

As an example, the filmmakers chose the version described in Traudl Junge's book to depict the moment when Hitler shot himself, a more dramatic version where Junge recalls hearing the gunshot while she is with the Goebbels children.  But, as James O'Donnell explains in detail, the two most trustworthy eyewitnesses outside Hitler's door when he shot himself did not hear the gunshot, and could not have heard it, because Hitler's room was heavily fortified, sealed off, and soundproofed.  Knowing this, Hitler had instructed them to enter the room after ten minutes had passed.

The most dramatic moments from the movie can all be found in ""The Bunker"" - Gen. Weidling ordered to report to Hitler's Bunker to be shot, and then getting promoted instead by Hitler; Professor Ernst Grawitz, a doctor, blowing himself and his family up with grenades at dinnertime;  Magda Goebbels coolly laying down a hand of solitaire right after killing her children with cyanide; Ambassador Hewel and Lieutenant Stehr blowing their brains out right at the moment that surrender is announced by an approaching German Colonel.

A great movie overall, made even better with a reading of ""The Bunker"" by James O'Donnell, the real companion sourcebook for this movie.",1146268800,,4469,5.061391541609822

2151705,5,B0002Z16HY,"One of the most significant statements of the always reminded master of the cinema, Robert Bresson, was :""To be models; instead of look like actors."" I would say that Olivier Hirschbiegel unconsciously followed this wisdom advise. This (Should I just label it film, or perhaps this term be insufficient, why not better to design it supreme artwork?) masterpiece simply surpassed all the eloquent adjectives of previous reviews.

The impressive narrative dissection, supported by a sinewy script, is loaded of such burden of mesmerizing, engaging and delirious realism, that literally involves you from start to end. This outstanding work is a true radiograph that explores with merciless crudeness all the insights of the last ten days of Adolf Hitler.

Bruno Ganz followed his bliss and stole that coveted pearl, that justifies the supreme artistic achievement of his lifetime. From the initial shot when the nervous secretaries wait for him, until his last Farewell; his delirious anger accesses, increasing withdrawal of the reality, eloquent grimaces deserves for him (without forget Javier Bardem in Sea Inside) the most towering performance in years.

On the other hand the camera leads us to the struggling and  increasingly claustrophobic environment. The camera handle and the fabulous angle shots from the floor accent still more that oppressive atmosphere (Do you remember Orson Welles The Trial?).

The inner tragedy is expressed with vibrant expression. Three expressive sequences are enough to support it: watch for instance the ominous sequence in which Goebbels wife dismisses from her children, the child `s  horror at the moment he will have to face the death in its portent in the middle of the flaming wrecks and finally the elusive gaze of Eva Braun in her last supper.

On the other hand, the dialogues are never superfluous. With a visible resources economy, Hirshbiegel built a huge stage that reminds us the true intention of the Greek Tragedy or Wagner in Gotterdamenung, to shake the soul through the catastrophe, is what we experience after we leave the Hall a true cathartic experience.

That superior coherence, the fact of fixing without congealing the feat of communicate expressions without the use of words is what it makes of this artwork a supreme masterpiece.",1144713600,23,2296,5.254098360655738

2151707,5,B0002Z16HY,"This very brief review is for this PREMIUM EDITION of DER UNTERGANG ONLY!

(If you're looking for reviews of the film, please go to the page entitled DOWNFALL. Personally, however, I consider the film to be one of the most outstanding in recent memory, and it is certainly very ""on point"" with what is currently happening in our own (United) States. Any citizen of the U.S. watching this film should be especially cognizant of what Hitler and his henchmen say about the German people, and what Traudl Junge says in the final documentary moments of the film.)

But enough of that.

For some reason, this dvd is shown as Region 1, NTSC. It is also being sold as such. WARNING: IT IS NEITHER! I even queried a seller about this precise thing before purchase, and the seller assured me it was so. When the dvd arrived, however, everything was in German, which caused me /some/ pause. I know some of the language, and it said there were English subtitles, so I was feeling ""okay"" about it. Then I saw two things: something that looked like a DVD Code 9, and something that looked like a Region Code 2. I wasn't sure, but I took it home and popped it into my player anyway. And much to my chagrin, the dvd didn't work.

The only ""happy"" news about this chain of events is that the seller seems to be making it easy for me to return the dvd. We'll see, as I'm mailing it back today.

But I must say, I am terribly disappointed. All of this hassle could have been saved, and more importantly, I REALLY do want a dvd of DOWNFALL/DER UNTERGANG with all of the extras. I absolutely ""love"" the film. (Love as in it is powerful and thought-provoking, has excellent performances, beautiful cinematography -I could go on, really- and most importantly, I think it gives the rest of the world a view of the way Hitler and his henchmen saw (took advantage of?) the German people unlike no other film has to date. Similarly, this ""glimpse"" shows very much about the German people today, and how they perceive their past. It is truly an awe-inspiring film -- it makes my heart ache on so many levels. For them, for us, for everyone.)",1143072000,6,2113,4.477922077922078

2151710,4,B0002Z16HY,"It seems pointless to belabour the fact that, with Nazis as with any other group of people, we are dealing with human beings. Human beings are flawed - we can become stubbornly devoted to ideals, to people, to cults, to beliefs, regardless of all the evidence that tells us our idol is flawed. Why is it so?

The answer to that is a complicated one, and at its heart lies the riveting appeal of this dark film.

Firstly, forget not that this is A FILM. A film by definition isn't attempting to portray with absolute historical accuracy what occurred in a series of particular occasions, although some attempts at accuracy are pretty much mandatory - the look, the ambience, the accents, the general storyline.

Insofar as the latter points are achieved, this film is accurate. But insofar as depicting EXACTLY what went on in those last days in Hitler's bunker - no. I have this information from my mother, whose father was inside the bunker during that time. He had no choice in the matter - being crippled and thus considered unfit for active service, he was seconded as a trench-digger, in case such services would be needed. His report of what went on in those final days (as remembered vividly by my mother) diverged on several key points from the narrative of the film - but that really doesn't matter unless viewers believe that they are watching a documentary.

What they see here is a film. It's a story. It's a story based upon true events, but edited and altered in order to make a good film.

And it IS a good film. Bruno Ganz as Hitler is fantastically good - uncannily good. Trudl Jung was excellent. Eva Braun - superb. Himmler, the Goebbels - wonderful. And so on, and so on. The actors are marvellous, and the cinematography is chillingly effective.

I did find myself sighing a little at the ""sanitising"" of one or two key figures in the film, in order to bring some heroism into the sad proceedings, which is why the film gets 4 stars from me rahter than 5. But the blacker side of things is remarkably true to life. Germans who wanted to surrender WERE killed by fanatic officers. Many citizens DID kill themselves - and no wonder. The whole terrible series of events that led to World War II had its traces in the shameful and humiliating restrictions imposed upon Germany at the end of the first world war. These restrictions were almost literally unbearable, imposing a shocking economic crisis upon Germany as well as grinding down the sense of self-worth of the country. It was inevitable that there would be a backlash - and backlash there was. Hitler managed to get into power, promising the German people the glorious destiny that he told them was their right. But Hitler's plans had never stopped at redressing the injuries... They encompassed world power, world domination, and he used the German people to snatch at that power. Under his leadership, the German soldiers struck back at the Russians for perceived insults, humiliations and brutalities inflicted upon them previously. There is no denying that the German soldiers behaved pitilessly and coldly, visiting atrocities back upon the Russians and others. So the German people were rightly terrified that the invasion by the Russians and Poles would mean horrible retaliations by the invaders. In town after town after town, some hanged themselves, shot themselves, took poison... Hitler's insane orders to continue resisting only made the inevitable worse. There was never going to be any salvation from him - and there truly is no excuse for his uncaring dismissal of the sufferings the German people would undergo upon the fall of Berlin.

What we see in this film is a portrayal of Hitler as a man of extraordinary ability and power. He is presented calmly, almost gently - with some sort of quality that is hard to define except to say that he could win people to his side somehow. He was not obviously charming - yet he could charm. He was no prince of instant appeal - yet he somehow drew such loyalty from people that they seemed able to forgive him anything, believe anything he said (even in flat contradiction of facts), and do whatever he said.

We see him reacting with wild violence as well. His rages must have been terrifying - his fluency with words damning those who simply COULD not carry out his orders because they had neither the men nor the ammunition to do what he ordered. A telling comment is made in the course of the film, about Hitler moving armies that he does not actually possess on a battlefield of his imagination. In Hitler's mind, the film illustrates, the only explanation for the gap between what he wanted to achieve and what was actually happening was gross betrayal on the part of those to whom he gave orders. Betrayal, incompetence, stupidity, lack of courage - he accused his followers of these things when they wavered, or even when they tried to achieve the impossible with forces they simply did not have.

And this is pivotal... TO my mind, the film ""Der Untergang"" is not about the disintegration of Hitler, but the disintegration of the German national dream, the fall of Berlin, the end of the Third Reich, the failure of Hitler's own plans. Hitler HIMSELF was always flawed. He was always the cracked bell from whom could come the sweetest of tones and the foulest of tones. He could change in a twinkling - he could kill, betray, lie, order tortures, hate rabidly, behave brutally - RIGHT FROM THE START.

That he considered compassion an evil is generally understood. That anyone could be fooled into somehow believing that he was a noble and heroic figure is attributable only to the force of personality Hitler must have possessed. He was a master at portraying the part of a man of strength, of vision, of infinite achievement.

The Goebbels followed Hitler even into death. The killing of their children paints the Goebbels as monsters, yet if one understands that Herr and Frau Goebbel were fanatically devoted to Hitler, believed utterly in his vision of a Germany of culture, pride, artistic merit, absolute worth, one can see the rails upon which their thoughts ran. To understand is to pity... and from the bottom of my heart I do pity them. Yet this pity is not untouched by horror. Those who act monstrously but explicably are to me more truly terrifying than those who behave monstrously without reason.

One is left with a profound sense of pity and melancholy as this film draws to its conclusion. A bright vision has perished. That this vision was flawed, and that Hitler mixed his vision of Germany as the world's highest place of culture with his utter loathing of Jews makes it no less pitiful... but then, war itself is a horrible thing. One can feel a profound sympathy for the stubborn young people trying fruitlessly to defend Berlin. They were so blindly devoted to Hitler's cause that it had become an ideal rather than loyalty to a person. The film demonstrates that everyone who followed Hitler was a victim of this megalomaniac in one form or another. Of course, his most intimate friends rivalled him for sheer monstrosity, but make no mistake: the engine that drove the Nazi regime was Hitler. He played an undeniable part in encouraging brutality and sheer lack of empathy among his intimates. Their responsibility for their choices falls upon their own shoulders, but personal magnetism is a powerful thing indeed, capable of blinding perfectly sane people as though staring for too long into the sun.

Der Untergang is a movie that will stay with you for a long time after it finishes. Intelligently written and directed, superbly acted, its minor drawback for me was the faint soft-soaping of a few characters whose concerns were not as altruistic and concerned over the fate of the German people as the film conveys. But this is indeed a minor thing.

I recommend the film highly. Grim but intelligent viewing.",1142812800,21,7886,4.767765567765568

Before DOWNFALL (aka DER UNTERGANG in Germany) ever made it to the U.S. he was telling me that I just needed to go see it.  Locally, this movie never made it to any of the more popular theaters; rather, it only made it to a theater known for running second rate movies or movies that have been around a while.  Nonetheless, I made the trip to this second-rate theater to see a German movie recommended to me by a German citizen.  MY FRIEND WAS SO RIGHT!!!  WHAT AN EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!

We would all like to believe that Hitler was an out-of-control psychopath, cruel and hateful to everyone. But in reality, he could be very kind, affable, and affectionate, just as long as you could prove Aryan, non-Jewish origins. A cruel lunatic would have had few followers, and Hitler knew it. He was careful not to play his hand very often, and it worked well for him. Most people didn't even know the full extent of his crimes until the war was over.

Much of the controversy surrounding this film centers around Bruno Ganz' amazing portrayal. This Hitler is by counts kind and charming, sad and broken. In other words, human. And yet he speaks with pride of his decimation of the Jewish population, refers to the youth of Germany as expendable casualties, and refuses to help the starving, terrified citizens of Berlin, punishing them for losing his war. He is delusional, bitter, and increasingly dangerous. It is impossible to feel sympathy for a man so bent on his own destruction. His final act of suicide (touted by Neo-Nazi's as an act of bravery) is nothing more than cowardice, an easy way to escape responsibility for the horror he unleashed. The truth is never a pretty picture, especially in this film, and an honest look at Hitler could never flatter him. A sympathetic film? Not even close.",1141344000,3,1432,4.821138211382114

Her cold heartedness is sicking as is ever heartwrenching moan that comes from each child before they die. Bruno Ganz is fantastic as ""The Fuhrer"" and it sickens me when people call Hitler evil. Evil is a horrible word.

2151722,5,B0002Z16HY,"60 years on a movie about Adolf Hitler is still a highly controversial thing. Especially since we were warned that we would now got a more human side of der Fhrer.

This was a little exaggerated. We do see some human sides of Hitler. He is nice to his secretaries, pets his dog and compliments a cook on her dinner. But that is pretty much all. Most of all we see a man who has lost it, makes strange strategic decisions, goes from being negative to positive and does not care at all about the German people. If they can't fight off the Russians, they don't deserve to die. His hatred for his own people was big at the end.

In the bunker during the last days of the Third Reich we see all the big names in the SS. Goering, Himmler but most of al Goebbels, who seems to have been the worst of all. Where the other nazis sort of saw what way they were going, he stuck by his leader until his own death.

I lost count on the many suicides in this movie. Many shoot themselves when the end is near. The most horrific part is when Goebbels' wife kills her own 6 children.

What makes the movie more horrible than others is that we actually know that what happened in the movie happened in real life. The suicides, anger outbursts and other deaths have all been written down. That is in German makes it even better.

Short clips of his secretary at the end and at the beginning give it even more truth. Short bio's of the most important people are given at the end as well

The acting is superb, you really start to fear Hitler and Goebbels. Bruno Ganz took on a very difficult job. How to portray someone without making it too emotional so people might get attached and feel for him. But that does not happen.

I like the fact that characters are not ""introduced"".  One has to know something about the Reich to discern Gobbels, Goring, Himmler and other assorted sycophants.

This film is in German with english sub-titles.  My only complaint is that the font size on the subtitles made reading the dialogue quite difficult and thus took something away from the visual aspect.  Secondly, towards the end of the movie, for some reason; the subtitles seemed to roll faster.

One of the secretaries to Hitler, frau Trudl, stated in an interview that she could have done something and that her youth was no excuse.  Maybe. In later years Trudl did do something, she helped later generations understand the nightmare that was the Thousand Year Reich.",1139097600,5,989,4.9393939393939394

As a native german, I am really sad that the film is not synchronized for the US. Knowing that americans are not used to synchronized versions and also agreeing that it is clearly more acurate and authentical, I still don't like the emotional barrier that is created by the 'foreign' language.

To really understand this time, you need to understand that none of this 'monsters' did feel like one. Most of them would have seen thenself as rightous, good persons that are fighting for the sake of a bigger goal, and that this perception was shared by most of the public. Some of these guys where intelligent, educated, brave and caring and still did unbelievable things, because they narrowed there minds up to a point, where they could no longer distinguish good from bad. Because they rated other things higher than humanity.

Why I would like us citizens to understand that point? Looking at the current goverment and of the political main stream, as an outsider you start wondering, where this development will lead to.

Already we have reached the point, where the killing and torturing of inocent people (assuming that there are inocent muslims and just ignoring the rewriting of the word torture) is an acceptable price for defending the freedom of america. A freedom that already begins to crumble with the ability to hold prisonsers outside the law, to spy on the own people starting from the vague idea, that they might be connected to terorists.

Well, not my duty to discuss this, since this is left to you. Anyhow, understanding that time and that a monsters could not be identified by the dress they wear and the tongue they speak, or by the care they give to they families might be a good reason to see this film.

Just stating that. Even though I wish it would be different, I might have fallen for this beautyful lies too. Hope you are better than I.",1138147200,19,1969,4.676300578034682
2151725,4,B0002Z16HY,"Though it was made in Germany, ""Downfall,"" the story of Hitler's last 15 days on Earth, it is pure Hollywood both in execution and tone....more television special mini-series than serious work of art.
With that said, the central story of Hitler's last days in the bunker with Himmler, Eva Braun, Goebbels, Eva Braun and his secretary, Traudl Junge (the real Junge appeared in her own documentary, ""Blind Spot"" her recollection of her time with Hitler and Eva in the Bunker) and assorted others is so fascinating that it is impossible to avert your eyes from the screen.
Director Oliver Hirschbiegel  and his production designer fill the screen with eye-popping, though not particularly sophisticated detail: the dark, claustrophobic bunker with Hitler (a dynamic Bruno Ganz) slowly losing control of his kingdom while his army and ss officers celebrate with the best French champagne and Russian caviar that recalls Nero fiddling while Rome burned.
Ganz appropriately chews the scenery with his crazy, ranting portrayal of Hitler on the one hand: been there, seen that. But Hirschbiegel shows a more human, tender Hitler: his warm relationship with Eva, who he marries while in the bunker (the person officiating at the wedding asks Hitler is he is 100% Aryan...a part of the official 3rd Reich wedding ceremony...funny) before he shoots and poisons her as well as his special relationship with his German shepherd, Blondi whom he also poisons. Does this do much to humanize Hitler, arguably the most hated man of the 20th Century? Not really but it does add positive texture to a life that most of us know so very little about. ""Downfall"" merely and I think naively points out that we are all capable of Evil.
Bruno Ganz excels when he digs beneath the surface and adds the little touches that humanize Hitler. He punctuates his performance with small details: the pushing back behind his ear of his unruly, straight, pomaded hair, the twitching of his left hand, which he holds behind him so as not to appear weak or sick in front of his officers and Ganz's use of his huge, bloodhound-like eyes to reflect and divert what is going on in his incredible, insane mind.
""Downfall"" is an interesting, diverting film: at times silly and melodramatic; at others...fascinating and enthralling. Ganz's performance makes it a must see.",1137974400,3,2328,5.0

2151728,5,B0002Z16HY,"Should I feel compassion for those who don't? It didn't make sense until I read Viktor E. Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. A psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz, Frankl learned to feel compassion for the compassionless, and he went on to teach his vision that was contrary to Freud's, that humanity is driven not by irrational urges but by a need for a sense of meaning and purpose for life.

I brought this insight with me to this film, The Downfall. I was able to see human beings each trying to derive meaning, fulfill purpose, do the right thing. To some the right thing was loyalty. To some it was dignity. To some it was survival.

The protrayals were ultimately human. Hitler was as familiar as a fanatical uncle. The message that demonizing a despot only obscures the truth was clear. The assertion that it wasn't all Hitler's fault, that it was the fault of all humanity for all time may be a little ahead of its time. But some may learn that the danger lies not in seeing one's similarities to evildoers, but in seeing only differences, and better to realize that there may be a Nazi of one ethnicity or another hiding in each one of us.

A willing participant's final admission that youth is no excuse opens the examination of the problem of excuses in general. Does The Downfall objectively present excuses to an audience resistant to excuses? How else to tell the story of a doomed world view that still needs telling?",1137283200,2,1433,4.6117647058823525
2151729,5,B0002Z16HY,"As a certifiable film buff deeply biased against anything made after about 1975 or so, I nonetheless consider this to be one of the four or five best films I've ever seen, period. Since so much has already been said, I'd just like to add a couple of thoughts. When you consider that this film cost a mere $8 million or so to make--big budget by European standards but a pittance in the US, where the lead star alone can earn several times that--the sheer brilliance of everyone involved in *Der Untergang* (Downfall) becomes readily apparent. The streets they used, actually in St. Petersburg, Russia, looked so convincing that I kept wondering how they could have reconstructed wartime Berlin so convincingly. The movie managed to be anti-war without descending into the realm of the maudlin and sappy; it combined an anti-war message with the undeniable excitement that makes traditional war films, for better or worse, riveting to watch. And riveting this film is, indeed. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Since I'm fortunate enough to speak German, I could appreciate it all the more. Although contemporary Germans are by NO means Nazis, the Nazis themselves were Germans, and therefore German actors could offer a degree of authenticity in terms of mannerisms, body language, speech, etc., that admittedly fine actors like Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guiness simply could not match in their English-language productions. The sight of a bunch of British actors standing around shouting ""Heil Hitler"" in plummy Oxonian English is nothing short of absurd. It does not cast aspersion upon contemporary Germans to recognize that an all-German (or Germanophone, at any rate) cast would be best able to convey the atmosphere in the Bunker, insofar as the surviving records and testimonies recount it. As if all this weren't enough, the film outdoes itself even further with its ending. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen the film yet, but let me just say that in its elegance and sheer novelty, it redefines anti-climactic. It is the perfect conclusion, absolutely stunning and thoroughly unexpected. I'm surprised at how few people mention it. Anyhow, if you are going to buy a DVD, buy this one. History may eventually judge it to be Germany's Citizen Kane.",1137196800,10,2286,4.955729166666667
2151730,5,B0002Z16HY,"This surpassed all my expectations, based on the reviews I had read.

Truly a brilliant movie. Superb acting, dialogue, and cinematograhpy. You get to know the characters enough to really care about them.

It is also a wake up call. This is what happens when you choose a set of beliefs and add to it blind devotion. Your brain shuts off and with it, many of the emotions that make you a decent human being.

I like the fact that, in Downfall,  no one is totally good or evil. They are all human. The only truly noble creature in the film is the dog.

I was reminded of the quote: "" All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.""

The film presents us all with the opportunity to ask ourselves the question, ""Had I been there would I have bought into this? Would I have had a good heart but too much fear to act? Would I have turned my back ---preferred ignorance? Or would I have acted?""

We all like to THINK we would have been noble and brave---but would we have been?

Hitler does make one point that is quoted as one of his worst statements. The problem is he told the truth. He said, In a war, there are no civilians.

He was right. Never has a war been waged since the beginning of time, that more civilians than uniformed people have not died. It is the nature of war. War is not a game of chess where you get your pieces back and start another ""game"". Those ""pieces"" are gone forever.

I am almost of the opinion that this film should be mandatory viewing for all college students.

There is hatred in this film. A lot of it.

We don't think of ourselves as people who hate. Ask yourselves though, if you aren't part of this polarized country that despises one side or the other of our government. If you do, then you are in line for the Hatred Medal and need to see this movie in order to learn to THINK rather than just ""join the band wagon"" on any issue.

God save us from such a fate as most of Europe suffered during this man's life. Take a look at what just one person can do to the world, then stop saying you are only one person and can't do anything to change the world.

2151731,5,B0002Z16HY,"On a recommendation from the video store guy, we rented ""Downfall,"" out of curiosity, more than anything else.

I'm not sure if I was expecting something done in the glitzy style of ""Pearl Harbor"" or a documentary worthy of an afternoon on the History Channel, but I got neither.

Instead, ""Downfall"" is a glimpse into the bunker of Hitler and his entourage in the final days of WWII. What I noticed is that there's really no character-building in the film; it really just feels as if you're literally standing there turning in slow circles and the film is just reflecting the anxious turmoil of the atmosphere.

The quiet desperation portrayed by the actor playing Hitler was haunting. While the cold-hearted nature of the man was not hidden or disguised in any way, we still see him as a human being rather than as the demonic emblem that modern history so likes to portray him as.

Now, don't get me wrong, the man was sick, but it's an interesting experience as one watches ""Downfall,"" to actually realize that a heart beat in that chest.

And his followers...good lord. Their utter dedication to his cause, the suicide, the loyalty even after his death is just riveting.

In a way, the strength, the bitter determination that pervades the walls of the bunker until all hope is lost is almost palpable and one can almost FEEL what Hitler's followers felt; and, it's almost understandable that they were brainwashed by the man.

And that's who we meet in this film: Hitler, the man. While it would be a far stretch to say that I found myself sympathizing for him, I do feel that, as I watched this movie, I came within reach of understanding him.

Chiseling down the anger, resentment and ugliness to reveal the man behind the infamy is what makes me give this film five enthusiastic stars.",1136246400,16,1793,4.687898089171974
2151732,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a superb movie that I helped me fill in a few questions I had about the end of World War II.  When I was young, the sensational media was still talking about finding Hitler, that is death was faked.  Sound familiar?  This movie takes inside the bunker in Berlin for the last few weeks of the war.  It is a reconstruction of various accounts from people who were there and left there testimony.  Several were still alive as late as 2000 and answered questions for the director.

I had always wondered what the end of the war felt like to the Germans.  What actually went on there receiving all that bombardment?  Since this movie was made by Germans primarily for Germans, this is a fascinating perspective on that phase of the war and what went on in and around the bunker.  It is quite puzzling how in control of everything Hitler remained and yet how seemingly out of touch with what was really going on outside and not far away.  One answer could be that he was aware and simply refused to admit it in order to manipulate others to carry on the suicide / destruction of Germany - which he clearly wanted and ordered others (such as Albert Speer) to do.  Thankfully, those orders were largely disobeyed.  The destruction of the war made things hard enough without acts of self-sabotage.

It was also interesting to see how all those around Hitler functioned and how Hitler manipulated and bullied them.  Their utter devotion to him and belief in him and the Reich bewilders me, but there it is.  I keep wondering why someone simply didn't take out a pistol and shoot him when it was clear everything was lost and it was apparent Hitler wanted to take everyone and everything with him to the grave.  But they didn't.  The seen of Magda Goebbels murdering her own six children with her husband standing just outside the door, when escape was still possible, is horrifying beyond description and made worse by its quiet bloodlessness.  However, this was the level of madness that possessed the true believers.

The other issue is one that is still quite touchy.  Hitler is an icon of evil.  He, along with Stalin and Mao, were the great killers of the 20th century.  Hitler is the safest one to criticize, because his regime is thoroughly repudiated while the other two still have political connections with the present even if they are personally repudiated.  Still, in reality, they were people.  Monsters, yes, but still human beings of a certain, if horrible, kind.  In nearly all representations of Hitler and the Nazis in movies, television, books, magazines, or whatever, they are simply embodiments of evil and barely even caricatures of human beings.  This is a serious movie and it is interesting to see him put on the behavior of a human being when it suited him and when he let the monster rage.

As interesting as the movie is, watch it a second time listening to the director's commentary.  While Oliver Hirschbeigel said that he is doing it without notes and simply reacting to what he is seeing on the screen, it is constantly fascinating.  He did a great deal of research for this film and knows a great deal of the history and shares it with us.  The few times he made things up, he tells us.  When he had to compromise the reality, he explains what it was and why.  He also discusses certain scenes and what he was going after.  The performances of the actors are also discussed and what they had to go through to make this film.  Most of those playing the key monsters understandably resisted the roles, but eventually took them on (obviously) and sometimes had personal issues with various scenes.  For example, the actress playing Magda Goebbels broke down during the filming of the scenes involving the murder of the six children (as does the audience watching).  However, on film she is as cold as can be.  In real life, the director tells us the reports have tears streaming from Magda's eyes as she plays the card game afterwards.  Here she is simply cold and dead as she lays out the cards.

While all of the actors are superb, Bruno Ganz as Hitler has to be singled out for praise.  It was very courageous to take on this role.  And the way he not only gives voice to Hitler but the physical embodiment of his physical deterioration is overwhelming.  This is a performance that should be recognized and honored for its artistry and courage.

The movie is in German with English subtitles.  Some of the subtitles move very quickly because of the amount of dialogue.  However, it is easy to pause the DVD and rewind if necessary.  Not all of the dialogue is essential to the understanding of the scenes.

2151735,4,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is a very interesting, thorough account of the waning days of the Third Reich, where the once all-conquering Adolf Hitler and his entourage were reduced to waiting out their doom in the ruins of Berlin. The authenticity of the film is apparent throughout, from the German actors and language to the uniforms and equipment. Of particular interest are the brief scenes involving what looks to be a real T-34/85mm tank, and scenes depicting some of the first assault rifles used in combat, held by Wehrmact motorcycle dispatch riders.

Especially entertaining in this movie is Bruno Ganz's wonderful portrayal of Hitler, who's premature aging and apparent parkinson's disease are shown to full effect by this talented actor. I particularly enjoyed the various scenes where some unfortunate messenger would come to Hitler with some news of misfortune occurring around the remains of the Reich, and the way Hitler would ponder this news for a moment before exploding in an angry shouting fit. This almost makes Hitler seem a comic-opera clown, but the reality of the destruction Hitler created, and the destruction now surrounding him in return, makes him a grotesque tragedy instead.

One character I wanted to see more of was the highly-interesting Herman Goering, Luftwaffe chief and so-called Reichsmarschal of Germany, in addition to (before his apparent betrayal of Hitler on the eve of the final collapse) being deputy-fuehrer. He's seen a couple of times in this movie but says nothing of import (in fact, I don't remember him saying anything). It would have been nice to see his credentials as a shady political figure showcased in the same way Heinrich Himmler's treacherous character was revealed in the film.

I watched this movie with friends but each of them considered the movie really long and boring. They are educated, intelligent people so I don't think they weren't enthusiastic about this movie because they aren't bright -- I think this movie preaches to the choir if you're already interested in the topic of WW2 and Hitler, but the movie just drags and drags if you aren't into the theme.

This movie can be highly educational in history classes if it is shown in segments with lots of class discussion/essay writing inbetween.

Even though I was interested in this movie, I felt every one of the 150+ minutes and have no desire to see it again soon, because it is an exhausting experience to watch even if you like the period in history being dealt with.",1135728000,6,2483,4.98792270531401
2151736,5,B0002Z16HY,"One may have seen the interview with Traudl Junge named ""Im Totel Winkel"", ""Downfall"" is the motion picture version of what she was talking about came to life. Hitler indeed was such a person, but what is controversial about it, is it the fact that sometimes he appears to be a caring person, but sometimes he is a brutal tyrant? He seems to care only when he thinks that the ""other"" person is intimately connected to him, in the form of loyalty, or rather, shall we say, worship, indeed in one of the scenes this fact is very well portrayed ""Oh mein Fuehrer, you are a genius I kneel in front of your cunning genius."" In fact what made him such an arrogant dictator was that nobody ever had a chance to confront him in a personal relationship. When he thinks somebody poses a threat, next thing we know, he will be executed,no matter how close he was to Hitler at some point in life. This is the standard picture since the Pharoh of the Torah for an ideal tyrant, and what makes a tyrant so cruel is a little bit of the blind loyaly of the people arround him.

  This is a movie that will make you reach out to the heart of the NAZI empire, the personalities of the close proximity of Hitler. It also points to the connections with the modern neo-Nazi movements too. It is a must see, better after ""Im Totel Winkel"" and ""The rise and fall of the third reich"" and possibly ""Der ewige Jude"", the propaganda movie of Hitler played in the theaters in Germany by 1941, in which Hitler declares his ""vision"". How can one claim that he/she did not know anything about what was going on in the concentration camps after being exposed to such propaganda by the way? I give ""Downfall"" 5 stars in my total sincerity.

  There is a lot to analize about the human nature in the Nazi era, the more you learn, the more you will find out. Of course there is more to say about Goering, Himmler and others too, but why don`t you see it for yourself?",1134604800,2,1932,4.323204419889502
2151737,4,B0002Z16HY,"Based on a memoir by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, this 2004 German film tells the story of Hitler's last days.  It takes place almost entirely in the bunker beneath the streets of Berlin and the viewer gets to watch the deterioration of the man who embodied the epitome of evil of our time.  This is a time of his weakness, his madness, and his unwillingness to understand the real defeat of his monstrous empire.  This film does not depict the Third Reich in all its glory.  Rather, we see its pitiful demise.

The cast feels absolutely authentic, and the most moving part of all is when Joseph Goebbles and his wife murder their own six children before committing suicide themselves because, as they say it, they cannot picture a life for their family after National Socialism.  The casting is excellent.  Hitler is very believable as the aging dictator who lapses into madness but who still commands absolute loyalty from all the people around him.  Alexandra Maria Lara is cast as the young secretary.  She's very pretty and has extremely large and expressive eyes.  She's young and nave and worships her leader.  However, at the end of the film, the real Traudal Junge, an old lady in 2002 when she wrote her memoir, is shown before the camera talking about her innocence and naivety in her youth and expresses deep regret for following Hitler so blindly.

The film was over two hours long and the setting is quite claustrophobic.  It's also unsettling to view Hitler so up close and personal.  We never feel sorry for him.  But we do see him as a very flawed human being.  And, of course we know how it will all end.  However, I did find the film intriguing.  It's another glimpse into the unthinkable world that Nazi Germany was.  This is not a film for everyone.  But it does add some insight from a unique perspective to the whole sorry story.",1133222400,6,1866,4.6310975609756095
2151738,4,B0002Z16HY,"Insights to a man who potentially could have taken over the world; in fact, from economically crumpled Germany, a man who was a prisoner to become a world power. Only to fall. I really don't agree that it was a movie about Hitler's ""inner feelings"", but showed a fanatic. The women who worshipped him, and even were willing to die with him.  And huge quantities of people--because Hitler was in charge of Germany--became just as fanatical: It is a case where the people agree with whatever the leader says and follows it blindly. Just because he's the ruler..right or wrong.

Nothing to do with the movie, but some thoughts entered my mind:  If Hitler would have won the war...my God everybody would be worshipping him as a God and seen as the biggest hero on earth. Sick, isn't it. I thought about some truths about our society-that multitudes of people will blindly follow whoever is in charge, that is follow the leader. He lost the war, so Hitler is viewed as a very sick individual. Again this has nothing to do with the movie, but perhaps inadvertantly this did come to my mind.

It also made me hypothosize-although the movie clearly demonstrates he ordered the Nazi party to burn his body so it ""won't be put on display in a museum"", it made me wonder...did he really commit suicide? Or was it another clever piece of propaganda. You see, I never heard of dental records verifying anything about Hitler's body. It made me wonder was this a clever deception so that Hitler could have been smuggled out and lived out his life...in obscurity. He had TONS of followers, and I'm sure rich folk willing to take care of him.

These thoughts just came into my mind although the movie DOES NOT AT ANY TIME even hint at such things.  It WILL make you think though, and of possibilities.

So it's a thought provoking movie. Not a super great movie, but it was very good. Very well acted too. I enjoyed the entire movie.",1133222400,7,1916,4.568513119533527
2151739,5,B0002Z16HY,"The movie does an excellent job of portraying the mental and physical disintegration of Hitler in the bunkers. Hitler is portrayed as having horrible views on humanity, but showing  kindness to his secretaries and his dog.

The movie is seen through the eyes of his secretary Junge. She doesn't realise the full scope of Hitler's insanity until much later after the war.  The really scary element is the people who remain loyal to Hitler when there is no hope and Hitler is obviously insane. There are the surreal elements of the movie. The generals pinning badges on soldiers and in some cases children when the army is destroyed and only a small remnant is left. Goebel's wife kills her children rather than let them live in a world without National Socialism. Men commiting suicide with their last bullet, when their leader dies in cowardice in a bunker.

The movie was poignant, powerful and scary. The Third Reich was not Hitler's dream alone, he was just a catalyst. Hitler was a monster, but he was still human. The movie was extremely violent and disturbing.",1132963200,2,1066,4.808743169398907
2151740,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" is a film that tells us about Hitler's last days, when the war was already lost and before he committed suicide with Eva Braun (Juliane Khler). Truth to be told, this movie is extremely well-made, and even though it doesn't make direct reference to all the people Hitler (played by Bruno Ganz) killed, it highlights the fact that he was an extremely unbalanced person capable of doing that and much more.

Director Oliver Hirschbiegel weaves an engaging if sometimes shocking story, based on true events, as remembered by people who lived with Hitler during his last days. One of them, Traudl Junge (played Alexandra Maria Lara), was nothing less than one of Hitler's secretaries, and as such a privileged spectator of what was happening in the bunker where Hitler and his entourage stayed. The drama of war is well depicted, as is the fanaticism of many of Hitler's followers, and the desperation of former adherents that ultimately realize that they have been following a madman.

Those who already know at least a little about this period will recognize characters such as Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen), Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) or Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), and will also probably learn about others that played a part during those last days. On the other hand, if you don't know a thing about this period, don't let that discourage you: you can always learn, and this is a good opportunity to do so.

All in all, I highly recommend this film. It is long, but thoroughly engaging, and not to be missed. I would like to add that if after seeing ""Downfall"" you feel like watching a documentary about the same subject, ""Blind spot: Hitler's secretary"" is also excellent.

I've read books about Hitler's last days, but this movie provided a really human face to the awful mess that was the collapse of the Third Reich.  It gives you the German perspective of this very dark and controversial chapter of their history.

The major criticisms that I've heard of this movie is that it gives a human face to Adolf Hitler.  We here in America tend to think that Hitler was the devil incarnate and/or he was crazy.  I have never believed that this view was constructive or correct.  Psychologically disturbed yes, crazy no.  I think we should never forget that Hitler was in fact a member of the human race and he was the kind of person that can both bounce kids on his lap as well as order the death of millions of people.  Mankind is capable of that kind of monstrosity.  It's very humbling and we must never forget or else we will be capable of harboring such monstrosity again.  People like Hitler only gain power if society let's them and that's something we should never forget.

Should be required viewing for high school history students.

2151743,5,B0002Z16HY,"Oliver Hirschbiegel's amazing film ""Der Untergang"" chronicles the last days of Hitler's Nazi Germany as observed through the naive eyes of his personal secretary Traudl Junge.  Junge played by Romanian born Alexandra Maria Lara was selected by Hitler in 1942 from among a group on young women to serve him against the advice of those close to her.  She remained by his side as the film fast forwards to April 1945 and the underground bunker complex under the Reichchancellery in Berlin.

Hitler, played with frightening reality by Bruno Ganz, complete with nervous tics and explosive and frenetic verbal outbursts is still, to the end, trying to maintain a hold on the reins of his dying empire.  He is surrounded by his closest staff most of whom show blind and fanatic allegiance to him.  Cracks, however, are beginning to appear in the resolve of several of his highest ranking ministers and generals.

In a wild spew, Ganz vows that he will never allow the Reich to surrender to the Soviet forces that are now encircling Berlin and his compound.  As the end draws closer, many of his devoted followers choose to commit suicide than to live in a world without National Socialism.  This is demonstrated quite disturbingly by Corinna Harfouch playing Magda Goebbels who coolly administers poison to her 5 sleeping children.  Then she and her husband Joseph played by Ulrich Matthes proceed to die by gunshot.

While many of Hitler's closest minions are swallowing their guns and shooting those who they consider traitors to their hopeless cause, Eva Braun played convincingly by Juliane Kohler is partying seemingly oblivious to the tragedy unfolding around her.  Finally both she and Hitler commit suicide and even still those remaining vow to continue the fight.

Hirschbiegel quashes feelings of sympathy for those players in this realistic drama evoked by virtue of the naivete of Junge.  She is filmed in present day saying that even though she was unaware of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, it was lax on her part to not have been more observent and tuned into their genocidal policies.

""Der Untergang"" proves to be a stark and realistic portrayal of what really happened in that bunker in the waning days of World War 2.  Director Hirschbiegel accurately captured both the fanaticism and hopelessness of that situation in his film.  My only criticism is that the film was a bit too long and better film editing might have eliminated the tendency for it to drag at times.",1131580800,3,2486,4.939903846153846
2151754,5,B0002Z16HY,"Allow me to start by confessing that it had taken a lot of time and persuasion for me to watch this film. I could not understand what was to be seen in the last few days in the life of  Hitler. While the film's advocates would keep answering: ""It's so powerful/realistic that you've got to see it.""

It should be repeated that the sources employed in making 'Downfall' were: Joachim Fest's novel, Inside Hitler's Bunker, and the memories of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge. Mrs. Junge, 25 at the time the events took place, wrote down her memories shortly after the war.

Myself, I had the feeling of watching something resembling a documentary. This film has hardly a plot. Moreover, its makers make a point in telling us, see DVD-extras, how faithfully they re-created the film's decor. The acting itself, by and large, is helping too. That feeling led me incessantly into questioning the veracity of the facts and dialogues - not that it mattered. I thought ""How could have a 25-year old lady, who seemed so surprised of nazi crimes afterwards, been in so many places in that brief period of time?"" When you watch Goebbels' wife killing her 5 children you may understand the point I'm trying to make. Hmm, I may need some 'getting used to' docudrama genre. Until then, 'Downfall' occupies the place of a court sketch-drawing - you are certain only of the verdict, even if Drer were to do it.

At this time, I find the value of 'Downfall' to be in reminding tyrants, or those who want to perfect the world and have the means to do it, that we are only humans, and thus governed by imperfection. So, don't even think about it!

At a different level, this film carries two major themes one would do well to internalize: For some, there is nothing to be learned and then not follow (the charismatic leader) blindly; And, absolute power corrupts absolutely. At least on the latter theme, the U.S. (Anglo-Saxon) political system seems to have some built-in protection. In case you find these 2 themes relevant, you may also want to check out ""Triumph of the Will.""

Since the aspect of Hitler as a human being, in conjunction with this movie, is so much discussed, I have to say that I fail to see any human(ized) Hitler. Not that the particulars in Hitler's life,  especially this late in the game, concern me a bit, yet wanted to briefly touch on this point too for those seeking it. After all, maybe this is what they mean by ""German movie for Germans.""

From the DVD extras, we learn that 'Downfall' was also meant to be a compressed history of the last days of the 3rd Reich, as well as the last 12 years in the life of Hitler. Considering this is a film, maybe these two are the appropriate, however simplified, hermeneutics.

In the end, I cannot tell you whether or not to watch it, but I'd be glad if my review helped you make up your mind. I should add, rating a film like this is a problem...",1131494400,,2901,4.531548757170172
2151755,5,B0002Z16HY,"I'm married to a German, so half of my family is German.  I had the opportunity to watch this film with my mother-in-law's boyfriend.  He is 79 years old, and served in both the Luftwaffe and in the German army during World War II.  He became a prisoner of war in the Spring of 1945, and thus was spared the untimely death that was delivered to many of the other young men of his age group.

We were spellbound by the movie.  The filmmakers did their best to draw the viewer into the situation, and they succeeded.  The viewer  feels the small triumphs, the frustrations, and the overarching horror of those final days.

Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler is nothing short of amazing.  We see the mental and physical wreck Hitler has become, more clearly than his followers.  We also see the occasional flashes of the polish and charisma that Hitler had displayed earlier in his political career - the magnetism that allowed him to conquer much of a continent.  More than anything, this movie transforms Hitler  from a caricature of evil to a flawed, irrational, and vicious human being.  This is an important point - it is easy to think of Hitler as a sub-human monster, but he was just a person with the gifts of persuasion and leadership.  Understanding this makes us realize that Hitler was not an anomaly, and others could take the same path.

My comrade in film watching, the German soldier, said that the film did a great job of showing the hopeless resignation of the  populace, the destruction, and the level of faith that many Germans still had in their leader.  Even to the very end, many people thought they could not lose as long as Hitler was leading them.

I highly recommend this film.  It is not entertainment - it is a window into history.",1131408000,4,1754,4.564102564102564
2151756,5,B0002Z16HY,"As a Brit I grew up immersed in both the myth and reality of the Second World War, for instance, I remember as a child in London during the 60's that parts of the city were still derelict from the Blitz, and unexploded German bombs would turn up on construction sites every so often, having been buried for all those years!

Probably the most heavily mythologized aspect of WWII was our ""Finest Hour,"" the ""Battle of Britain,"" where a bunch of very splendid chaps, hopelessly outnumbered, took on the might of the German Luftwaffe, getting their crates into the air and flying off to meet Jerry over the Channel. We could also enjoy tales of equally splendid chaps, spending their time tunneling out of ""escape-proof"" camps overseen by sneering, jack-booted Commandants, and totally inept guards.

So I was intrigued when I heard about a German film that concentrated on Hitler's final twelve days in the Berlin Fuhrerbunker, especially as it purported to show Hitler as a ""Human Being,"" and not just a ranting, anti-Semitic, frothing-at-the-mouth mad-man.

If I had doubted the claims of a ""human"" Hitler, the film immediately proves its case with a low-key beginning; a group of young women are led through a military checkpoint to an underground facility, the Bunker. They are to be interviewed by the Fuhrer himself for the position of his personal secretary; he moves along the line asking each woman her name and where they're from, each answers stiffly and ends with a, ""Mien Fuhrer!"" After the second or third girl answers in this fashion, the dictator tut-tuts, and good-naturedly tells them to forget all about the formalities and just answer the questions; he's looking for a secretary, not a general! The last girl in the line, Traudl Junge catches his eye, and is invited into his office for a typing test. Hitler starts to read from hand-written notes, Traudl tries to keep up, but nerves cause her to makes a complete mess of it; the Fuhrer looks over her shoulder and kindly suggests that they try again.

I have to admit that this beginning threw me completely, but there was more to come, we see generals bravely defending their troops against Hitler's hysterical charges of cowardice - and genuinely risking their lives in doing so - Albert Speer, ""Hitler's Architect,"" begging the Fuhrer not to proceed with a ""scorched earth"" policy that would only hurt the Volk, the German people, and later facing Hitler to tell him he had personally disobeyed his direct orders in this regard. We see Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, the primary architect of the ""Final Solution"" to the ""Jewish question,"" discussing how to save the Nazi German state after the death of Hitler, by negotiating a peace with Britain and America, and even the old monster Joseph Goebbles, Hitler's Propaganda Minister, is allowed a moment of humanity, reaching out to comfort his wife after she murdered their children.

The film is told almost entirely from the viewpoint of Traudl, and this is not surprising as her autobiography, ""Until the final hour,"" is one of the primary sources for the production; what we see is, for the most part, what she either saw, or overheard.

The production values are superb, and this is especially true of the Fuhrerbunker itself, cramped and claustrophobic, it's not, I'm sure, what most people would have expected. The scenes ""above ground,"" as it were, are equally well realized, and you really feel that you are watching one of the great cities of Europe burning and being blasted to hell by the advancing Russian troops.

But the heart of this film is, of course, Bruno Ganz's superb portrayal of Hitler; it is, as the jacket says, ""A performance for the ages!"" What we are given is a man, no matter how evil or despotic, instead of a ranting caricature or parody, something the actor says he was worried about. Over the course of the film we see the Fuhrer's physical condition, as well as his mental state, rapidly deteriorate, stricken by the early stages of a Parkinson's type condition, he becomes frail, but increasingly paranoid, leading to volcanic outbursts against his own officers, the German people as a whole, and, of course, the Jews of Europe.

Whilst these scenes can be difficult to watch, the most harrowing sequence is the murder of the six Goebbles children by their own mother, Magda. A true fanatic who worshiped her Fuhrer almost as a God, she was unable to countenance them living in a world devoid of National Socialism. So, with the death of Hitler she drugged each of the children with morphine, then, once they were unconscious, fed each of them a cyanide capsule in what has to be one of the most cold-blooded acts of infanticide ever perpetrated.

IMHO, Downfall is an extraordinary achievement, and is completed by a prologue and epilogue spoken by Traudl Junge herself. This film easily stands alongside productions such as ""The World At War,"" the BBC's ""History of World War II,"" ""Das Boot,"" and ""Schindler's List;"" it should be seen by the widest possible audience... I simply cannot recommend it highly enough!

I would also recommend, for once, that viewers watch the ""Making Of"" feature. A fascinating piece, it has the, mostly, German actors talking about portraying the monsters from their own past, including one actor who lost his entire maternal family, apart from his grandmother and two cousins, in the Camps!",1131235200,17,5381,4.903296703296704
2151757,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall impressed me greatly on a number of different levels.  It can't be easy to make a movie showing your country's destruction and acknowledging the atrocities your own countrymen committed.  The fact that Germany won't allow publication or importing of Mein Kampf even as an historical document has always suggested to me a national desire to just pretend the events of the past never happened.  For obvious reasons, I was exceedingly interested in watching this film.  How would Hitler be portrayed?  Would there be any mention of the Holocaust?  I had these and many other questions.  All those questions were answered with a surprisingly nuanced film of great complexity and depth.

Downfall chronicles not only Hitler's last days inside the bunker but the immediate aftermath of his death and Germany's surrender.  To a significant degree, that story is reflected through the eyes of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's personal secretaries.  Video clips of an interview with the elderly Junge from Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (2002) frame the presentation (ringing rather hollow, if you ask me - but that's really neither here nor there).  In the claustrophobic confines of Hitler's bunker, we witness the final days of the already broken Fuhrer, the individual dramas of those in Hitler's inner circle as they wrestle with the decision to leave or stay, and the total destruction of German society along with National Socialism.

The treatment of Hitler is, to my mind, exceedingly well done.  Hitler was a much more complicated man than many give him credit for.  His personal demons came to consume him, but there was a human side to the man, as well - and this film brings that out in a very nuanced way.  This is not to say that Downfall makes of Hitler a sympathetic character - not in the slightest.  His hate and venom are never far from the forefront, but this actually stands to reinforce his exceedingly human weaknesses.  His mood swings are severe, especially as the end draws near - and he's not always rational.  Betrayal drives him into a fury, especially the ultimate betrayal by Himmler.  Yet he remains lucid enough to plan his death in an effort to keep his remains out of the hands of the Russians.

Almost as fascinating as Hitler himself, in both history as well as this film, are the Goebbels.  Joseph Goebbels himself remained loyal to the very end, and it can be said that his wife Magda was even more dedicated to Hitler and National Socialism than he was.  She, after all, killed all six of her children rather than let them grow up in a world without National Socialism - and that scene proves to be the most riveting of the entire film.  Eva Braun is an almost extraordinary character in the film; maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think the filmmakers gave an accurate picture of her at all.

Then there are the military leaders who watch Hitler give orders their decimated armies cannot possibly follow.  Loyalty is a powerful force in these men's lives - but their loyalty is to Germany rather than Hitler himself.  For this reason, they are the ones asking Hitler to spare the German people and to think about ending the war.  For some, though, the distaste of Germany's surrender from World War I overrides everything else in their determination to fight to the death - and I think that was a most telling point for the film to make.  The only real problem I had with the film was the fact that I was hard pressed to identify several of the most prominent characters.  All of the actors were made to resemble the men they played, but - even though I'm familiar with most of the historical figures - I really couldn't figure out the identities of several characters over the course of the film.

You may be wondering if the film actually shows Hitler's suicide on the screen - I wondered that myself.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to tell you how the scene plays out.  You will find a significant number of fairly graphic scenes in the film, though.  It truly is a realistic presentation of Germany's darkest days, with the increasingly devastating destruction of Berlin going hand in hand with the physical and mental breakdown of the man ultimately responsible for it all.  Honestly, I never expected any German filmmaker to produce such an honest, complex, awe-inspiring motion picture about their most infamous national leader.  Downfall is a must-see.",1131148800,6,4393,4.804260985352863
2151758,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" has received some criticism here and elsewhere for ""humanizing Hitler.""  In that regard, I think that the movie ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" ought to be a prerequisite for seeing ""Downfall.""  In that film, we hear Hitler's young secretary, Traudl Junge, discuss Hitler as a gentle, caring father figure.  She's so close in, she has limited visibility of the scope of the insanity and destruction this man has sown throughout the world.  And, since much of ""Downfall"" is from Ms. Junge's eyes and her ""Blind Spot"" position, this is the Hitler we get.

Acting-wise, ""Downfall"" is a tour-de-force from Swiss actor Bruno Ganz  (a favorite of mine from an all-time favorite movie, ""Bread and Tulips"").  He plays Hitler as a claustrophic, deranged, literally shrunken, shell of a man beset with the very definition of ""bunker mentality.""  There's also some riveting acting from the actors playing Speer, Goebbels and Himmler.

One can only imagine the impact ""Downfall"" had in Germany.  As one reviewer here aptly puts it, this is a ""German movie for Germans.""",1130630400,4,1069,5.127167630057803
2151759,5,B0002Z16HY,"I can't praise ""Downfall"" enough for it's historical accuracy and superb acting. I first saw this film in a dark theatre and constantly had the feeling of being in the bunker and actually watching Hitler and his entourage during their final days. Things I love about this film:

BRUNO GANTZ

""Downfall"" would not be the powerful film that it is without veteran Swiss actor, Bruno Gantz. He is the first actor who managed to convince me that it really was Hitler on the screen and just not an actor mimicking Hitler. It's like the man was born to play this role and got it right in every respect--his expression, his gestures, his voice, his speech acts, his posture, really everything.

THE LOYAL ENTOURAGE

Powerful performances were delivered by the rest of the crew as well. As with Gantz they had me convinced. While they were merely excellent, though, Gantz was perfect.

BERLIN

The scenes of battlefield carnage in Berlin were completely convincing. Ironically a few blocks of St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Russia were used to film the final days of the capitol of the Third Reich.

HISTORICAL ACCURACY

The film was beautifully researched and unlike other WW II era films like the incredibly wretched ""Pearl Harbor"" was historically accurate to the point of perfection. I love it when filmmakers fall in love with their subject to the point where research and accuracy clearly becomes a labor of love for them.

THE W FACTOR

OK, it has to be said: many of the mad ravings of Hitler and his entourage in the last days of the bunker were eerily reminiscent of the current regime in this country. At a certain point when he hears the bombs falling all around him, a fanatical Joseph Goebels declares that everything happening is right because ""the German people gave us a mandate!"" Sound familiar? And faced with a military debacle of his own making, Hitler carries on as though everything is fine and going according to plan. Sound familiar? As the curtain draws around them, Hitler and his entourage remain enraptured by their ideology and fanatically resistant to any kind of objective analysis. Sound familiar? Whittled down to their last days in the bunker, their political agenda is finally exposed as nothing more than theatre. Sound familiar? And of course anyone who interprets the harsh reality around them in a different light is branded a traitor. Sound familiar?

No, I'm not saying that W and company are mass murderers on an even remotely comparable scale (they've mass-murdered in the tens of thousands not tens of millions). But I am repeating what many educated people have already publicly observed, namely that the mindset between the fascists in that bunker and the fascists in this one is remarkably similar.",1130284800,13,2734,4.908893709327549
2151760,5,B0002Z16HY,"the moral of the story here is that even ordinary people who can show love and consideration are very capable of doing the utmost evil. that's pretty much the complexity of human nature that neither good nor evil is absolute. and most people do evil in the name of good - it is just a perverted sense of the good/right.

hitler shows his care and concern for his close friends, confidants and his dog. but he is venemous against the jews and traitors and inconsiderate of the plight of the ""average german"". mrs goebbels poisons her own children, whom she loves but cant imagine living in a non-nazi society. and likewise ...

this movie was based on the account of hitler's typist. so there's always some amount of scepticism as to how much of this is true. actually in the final scene the girl is shown as cooly escaping to the countryside - given that the invading armies are said to have raped every female in berlin, it is hard to believe this.

but the acting is splendid - especially hitler who shows that he's cracking up by the moment. his fanatical followers who on one side are disobeying him for his impracticality but on another are willing to die for him. the helplessness of those who realize that it is all going wrong and the naivete of those who don't realize ... the complexity of the situation is beautifully brought to climax.

2151763,5,B0002Z16HY,"As a World War II enthusiast and a World War II film buff, I was very curious about this foreign film which had garnered so much controversy.  I was also intrigued to learn that DOWNFALL marks the first time there has ever been a German-made (and therefore German-spoken) film about Hitler and the Third Reich.

With the release of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the rules about war movies seemed to change (especially World War II movies).  No longer would they be the comic book popcotrn flicks of yesteryear.  Now, they would have to be ultra-realistic (perhaps even ""surrealistic""), gritty, and in-your-face.  But five years before the release of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, in 1993, SCHINDLER'S LIST changed the way Nazis were portrayed on the screen.  No longer would they be the one-dimensional comic book villains you might see in an Indiana Jones movie.

I say all this to point out that DOWNFALL has changed the rules once again by portraying Nazis in a whole different light: as human beings.  This is not to say (and many people have already made this mistake about the film) that the film downplays the evil of their philosophy.  Nor should this film be thought of as historical revisionism (though Hollywood is unfortunately headed in that direction).

The acting in DOWNFALL is superb.  It would be hard for me to ever see another Bruno Ganz film without thinking of his performance as Adolf Hitler.  All the performers were top-notch.  Never have I seen a film look so real: not because of special effects or make-up or anything like that, but because of pure talent and on-screen presence.

Many years ago, I tried to read William Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH.  But I couldn't get into it (primarily because I was a very undiciplined reader).  But seeing this film has made me want to read that book and learn the definitive story of this very dark time in world history.  And I don't think any other film would have done this for me.",1129507200,6,1951,4.707964601769912

It's obvious Ganz has done his homework as well. From his posture, his mannerisms and even his speech, it's almost like watching Hitler in the flesh. This portrayal is up there with Scott's ""Patton"" Brando's ""Don Corleone"" as a watershed moment in acting.
Another performance worthy of note is the lady that plays Magda Goebbels. She is the most coldly monstrous female villian onscreen since Louis Fletcher's ""Nurse Ratched"" in Cuckoo's NEst.",1129248000,6,603,4.98019801980198

My set-up to the viewing of this Best Foreign Film offering, numerous World War II novels, hours of documentary footage and a few spoofs left me with a bit of skepticism. My knowledge of Hitler ended with his vanishing act in Berlin, 1945. A week prior to viewing ""Downfall"", the Discovery Channel had a look ""Inside Hitler's Bunker,"" which I would recommend to those who think the director was inventing details. When the movie moved forward I found myself immediately within the minds of the characters and the claustrophobic circumstances,strangled by their web of ruin. The focus of this movie is upon the leaders the people choose to follow. We all know the scope of their atrocities, created by smiling faces surrounded by dogs and children, claiming ""victory"" when there is none in sight, ""unity"" or ""strength"" when there is compelling evidence otherwise. How many of us continue to take the Party line, hook, line and sinker? This movie is a wake-up call and an engrossing study of political madness and ruin. I doubly recommend this.",1129075200,5,1139,4.9375
2151778,5,B0002Z16HY,"Unlike previous film renditions of Hitler's bunker days (""The Last 10 Days"" [1973] and ""The Bunker"" [1981]), ""Downfall"" is more like a precisely tuned German Time Machine than the tour de force of the Hitler role in previous films. Downfall is based upon accounts from Hitler's personal secretary, Traudi Junge (Check out book: ""Until the Final Hour"" [2005]) and other resources (Also check out ""Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier"" by Siegfried Knappe [1993] and ""The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle"" by Anthony Read [2004]). Ms. Junge makes a documentary type cameo appearance describing her own naivet&eacute; at being drawn in (but never quite apologizes) and the film pretty much revolves around Junge and her nearsighted view of Hitler. However, this film succeeds where almost all accounts of behind the scenes chronicles of Germany at war's end fail. It does this by employing the role of Junge as a typical ""German"" and how her non-committal becomes an act of ardent support (even doting affection) for Der F&uuml;hrer. In doing so, with strict adherence to all the facts gathered around the ""bunker"" characters, Hirschbiegel has created a virtual time window into those final days. For anyone interested in these events I cannot but recommend this film.

Bruno Ganz obviously did considerable study of Hitler before taking on the role. Aside from having the body language down, he also delivers Hitler's unique intonation of the German language (anyone familiar with audios or film reels of Hitler's speeches will find the performance downright creepy). In fact, all the characters, though sometimes dissimilar in appearance to their real-life characters, provide thoroughly convincing personas of the historic counterparts. Most notable is Corinna Harfouch in her Media like role as Magda Goebbels. Here, the screen takes the time to briefly portray the strange emotional triangle that existed between Hitler and the Goebbels. Hitler was known to have been extremely fond of Magda and went at lengths to hold that shell of a marriage together when Joseph began to sleep around. However, the film does not go into this or other historical character reconstructions (there simply isn't time) so the unfamiliar viewer may at times miss some undertones to the couple's stern interaction.

In the end, this film does what only one other film (The Man in the Glass Booth [1975], Best Actor nominee Maximilian Schell) has attempted to do, and that is to answer the question as to `why the German people followed Hitler'. As this unfolds the viewer may begin to feel uncomfortable. There appears to be a bond between Traudi Junge, as well as with the often disagreeing General Staff, towards Hitler that transcends simply following-the-leader or even patriotism. In ""The Man in the Glass Both"" the main character ""Goldman"" refers to this as the German people's ""Love"" for Hitler. In ""Downfall"" this becomes unnerving obvious because you witness what appears to be a sympathetic portrayal of a vile monster. However, this approach provides the most credible portrait because for twelve years this charismatic creature, with engaging blue eyes and social charm, lead Germany through the battlefields of Europe and the dark recesses of mass extinction death camps. In today's world, where numerous countries endeavor towards righteous nationalism and narrow political agendas, this film provides chilling relevance.",1129075200,6,3428,5.311233885819521
2151779,4,B0002Z16HY,"The Bruno Ganz performance is really incredible. It was like Hitler had come to life. I found this movie very realistic. The only thing I didn't like about it was, it seemed that except for Hitler and Goebbels and a few others, most of the Germans in the film are portrayed in a more or less sympathetic light. But in reality, there were millions of Germans who had to work for naziism to keep the Nazi State functioning and in the war. I found the portrayal of the high military leaders too sympathetic for my liking. Yet, I highly recommend this film, as it is a very accurate and realistic portrayal of Hitler's bunker in the final days. The statement made by Goebbels, which he actually made of: ""If the German people don't win this fight, then they will just have their small throats cut"" is an unbelieveable statement, but one that Hitler and Goebbels believed. It shows the ultimate moral cowardice and cynicism of the Nazis. This movie will have a big effect in Germany, where it will show generations that Hitler and the nazis really didn't even like the German people that much. They were interested in race and power, not the individual. Bruno Ganz should have won an Oscar for his performance.",1128902400,5,1205,4.609302325581395
2151780,5,B0002Z16HY,"A telling scene, one of many brilliant ones in ""Downfall"", is when Hitler's secretary, the young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), huddled deep in the catacombs of the Reichschancery, complains to her friend, ""My parents warned me not to get mixed up in politics.""  It's one hell of a career choice you made, Ms. Junge.  Is that your boss on the sofa, calmly discussing suicide methodologies with his fiancee?

""Downfall"" will set the standard for years to come in its complex depiction of Adolf Hitler, and for those of us reared on cardboard cutouts of Hitler (Richard Basehart's comes to mind), Bruno Ganz's Hitler is a revelation.  This Hitler has a complex span of emotions, not simply contrasts between evil plotting and insensate rage.  When Albert Speer says his goodbyes and confesses that he has failed to obey a ""befehl"" (order) to destroy all of Germany's infrastructure, Hitler sheds quiet tears.  The string of betrayals is endless, leaving, at the end, only the vacuous Eva Braun and the cadaverous Dr. Goebbels beside him to share his fate.

Ms. Junge, whose expressive round eyes take in everything, is the window to the end of a world, albeit a distorted and evil world unparalleled in Western Civilization.  I strongly disagree with reviewers that as a German film, it is somehow an apology for National Socialism or the German complicity with the war or Holocaust.  Rather, the film courageously attempts to both recreate the end of the regime while letting us view the end from participants who were not ideologues but individuals caught up, like moths, in the dim light of a perverted science.  (Yes, I stole that one from Winston Churchill.)  Many of these people are careerists, and it is up to us from the outside to exclaim, ""How could you not know? How could you have been taken in?""  They stare back at us, asking what we would have done in their shoes.  Hopefully, a much better career choice, for starters.

We Americans like our movies neatly tied up in a moral whole, with no ambiguities. With the possible exception of the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, we have not had to endure the loss of a nation-destroying war or suffer massive invasion.  What is particularly striking, and well portrayed in ""Downfall,"" is that the truest believers in Hitler were the youngest.  Unlike the cynics who peopled the highest echelons of the Nazi regime, Hitler's most loyal disciples were the 14 year olds who held to the last, killing themselves in suicide attacks against Soviet tanks in the streets of Berlin.  One of the most tragic features of modern war, whether in Cambodia, Rwanda or Sudan, is the child behind the machine gun, and this movie does well in its treatment.

The Germans have in recent years made nearly flawless WW 2 films, including ""Das Boot"" and ""Stalingrad.""  ""Downfall"" will occupy a rightful place next to these.",1128729600,10,2868,4.852156057494867
2151781,3,B0002Z16HY,"Failure to establish any historical, geographical, context for the events depicted  make this a far less effective (and useful) film than it might have been.  The cloistered surroundings, indeed, were part of the story, but much is lost by totally shutting out the audience from any sense of the vast,  supra-national  scope of the Nazi enterprise shown now on the brink of it's due Reckoning. Not until the film has finished are any hints given, and then only in terms of millions killed or perished.  Even if viewers ought reasonably be expected to have comprehensive background knowledge, visual reminders of the reach of the German military at its zenith, its continental swath of hellish murder and destruction, and the dimensions of its collapse and defeat would have greatly complemented  the unfolding bunker story. A like enhancement could have been provided by some glance, however brief, at the unprecedented massiveness of the forces closing in on Berlin, as well as by some suggestion of what those forces might have been expected to exact upon survivors. As it is, we are offered  rather generic pictures of  a Leadership at Bay, with only expected concerns about a conquering army bent simply on victory and war's end.

  There is nothing especially dishonest about the Hitler on display, nothing per se meretricious in showing him in his human ordinariness, tucking into his vegetarian meals, reacting to this or that with sentiment or outrage. But without some textual offering touching on what he'd wrought and wreaked from one end of Europe to the other, the portrait is, at best, disingenuous.

Told through the eyes of a young secretary for the Fuhrer, Downfall takes you on a story back in time to when the world was torn by one of the worst wars ever to hit the face of the earth. You get to see something never shown in a film before and that is Hitler being portrayed more as a person than as a one dimensional maniac as many other movies do, not to say it is a pro-Hitler or National Socialist feature, it just sheds a light on something that is never really shown in a non biased historically accurate picture. The final days of the life of Nazi Germany and Hitler are a truly amazing period of time, at one point a German loss was almost impossible to imagine.

He refuses to believe that there are no more troops, relates his failures in the war to the cowardice of the German people instead of to his own failings, seems to take pride in his lack of education compared to that of the Officer corps, and so on.  By portraying him as sick, one can say that this is not a moral lapse but a physiological one, and that is the problem here.

Goebbels and some of the others are painted with the brush of pure evil, but the film's treatment of Hitler has no such clarity.  With his gentle treatment of his beloved dog (until the end of the movie) and his relationship to his secretary, and to the Goebbels' children, and to some others, the film is trying to emphasize a certain humanity in Hitler.  But what's the point.

The film appeared to try to lighten the load of this conflict from the point of view of the German people.  It tried to say that Hitler was at heart a compassionate man, and when he did go off the deep end, it was his demons, not his will.  It attempts to lighten the true nature of evil, and that is just plain wrong.",1128211200,4,1193,4.290178571428571

Nothing that Hitler says in the film is fictional, neither the reactions and deeds of his entourage. The characters, the costumes and the surroundings of the Fuhrerbunker are magnificent but I wish the film had focused more on the ordinary German people than the top Nazi clique.

I have always wanted to see a state of the art film of Hitlers last days in the bunker. Already  knowing history it is facinating to see the impending doom of the Nazi army. Bruno Ganz plays hitlerwith all his idiosyncrasies unnervingly. Observing Hitlers emotions while he realizes his demise is near plays out in an engrossing fashion. I thought the film jumped around a bit much, but considering the amount of charactors covered it seems somewhat reasonable. The scene where the children are ""mercifully"" killed is very disturbing. However realism is in full effect in this movie so be warned. The blending of sorrow among the SS and others mixed with the outward brutality towards life is strange. But, this is a hard edged war film of the best kind. The city of Berlins war torn streets are striking images that are well filmed. Another aspect to the movie is that it is shot through the eyes of Hitlers personel secretary who was alive as of recently and gives a pre&post film commentary. Reading the subtitles really bring you into the movie, and the dialogue is superb. The film could have been perfect save a few unnecessarily drawn out scenes. Most of the German actors really captured their rolls exceedingly well. The dvd audio is stunning. The sounds of weaponry inside and out of the bunker place you right there.

2151831,5,B0002Z16HY,"I was not sure what to think of the hype surrounding this film, but, after seeing it, I realize that the buzz was completely legitimate. We often hear the phrase, ""history reenacted,"" but so often it means ""history embellished."" That is not the case here as it seemed quite in keeping with the events Anthony Beevor outlined in his historical masterpiece, Berlin: The Downfall. It was as if he redrafted his text with actors rather than words. Speaking of actors, what can you say about Bruno Ganz? Best ever? He certainly surpasses the efforts of Sir Alec Guinness in The Last Ten Days. I'd put this performance right up there with Daniel Day Lewis's in Gangs of New York. I was not prepared for the way his Hitler in the bunker perfectly embodied the Hitler in the bunker I've been reading about for thirty years. The casting was absolutely unbelievable. With Speer, the director's decision was immaculate. That is the Albert Speer of the Nuremberg Trials. If you're a student of history, you'll see that the likenesses and mannerisms of General Jodl and Field Marshall Keitel allow one to instantaneously identify them. Eva Braun looks like the genuine article, but, when personality is figured in, it is as if she were crafted from an A.J.P. Taylor footnote. The only thing that struck me as being unbelievable was Goebbels' comment about how ""the German people will have their little necks snapped."" Goebbels was a tremendously evil man of whom nothing good can be said, but I do not think that he would have, or did say, such a thing. The lack of compassion of Der Fuhrer for the German citizenry is well documented, however, as two scenes with Speer make allusion to the infamous Nero orders. The great messiah of Deutschland was never much interested in his subjects--except for how they would allow him to be viewed by history. Hitler's mental illness is graphically evident in The Downfall, and that is yet another testament to its excellence. You could give me several days, but I could not find much to criticize about this movie. Even the title shines as it isn't about the bunker or the last days; it's a haunted requiem for the nefarious Third Reich. A state scheduled to last for a 1,000 years, but kaput by year 12. This downfall is as vivid, realistic, and worth your time.",1126742400,4,2291,4.73

This movie should be seen by everyone to realize what a country can turn into by a leader who appears to be a saviour.

What you see is a man with total power and control even after his death. If he would have had the power to do so, he would have destoyed the world by pushing a button.

The acting is superb, and the rage and lunatic actions shown by Hitler are very accurate. Many times I found myself wondering how things had gone so far astray that all this was happening.

2151833,5,B0002Z16HY,"The portrayals of the leaders is to my knowledge accurate: I recognized quite a lot of the dialogue from my own studies as Hitler's and Goebbel's exact words, and the portrayals of their personalities matches, too.  Yes, indeed, Hitler is not portrayed as a monster, but as a human being, but (as the director and the actors note) this actually makes the portrayal *more* chilling rather than less.  No one will come out of this movie sympathizing with the man because the actor Bruno Ganz gives him depth.  Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, comes out as neither too naive nor too aware - in short, about right.  But that makes the gradual dawning of her situation, and of her misplaced faith, equally chilling.

A point of correction, though: this is not a movie about the last ten days of Hitler (who dies halfway through), but the last ten days of the Third Reich.  As the director rightly notes, the Nazi machine ran on inertia for a few days even without him.  You see a lot of Hitler and Goebbels, and of the bunker staff, but you also see the desperation and disillusionment above ground, too, as what's left of Berlin is reduced to rubble.  This, in fact, makes this a far better film than merely showing Hitler and the bunker.

This is one of the few films where some of the DVD extras are also worth watching, especially the actors' and actresses' comments on the difficulties of playing their roles (especially Corinna Neufauch's preparation for the scene in which Frau Goebbels poisons her six children).

2151846,5,B0002Z16HY,"Over the last year I have tried to get my hands on as much movies about WWII as possible. Top on my list was Conspiracy, a very good made-for-TV movie with superb acting and historical data. Taking Sides and Band of Brothers are excellent choices in their own context. Saving Private Ryan is simply a disapointing fictional story about a historical event: I mean, they did have like a thousand stories to chose from, why chose a fictional one? Gathering Storm, a short BBC movie about W. Churchill does not even cover England at war and is not really top on my list.

There are some other very importat choices like Inside the Third Reich (a bit hard to find) and finally Hitler's Diaries where you do find Mr. Hitler in real person, not an actor's performance. Although the editing is too biased and the text scroll-ups anoying (not to mention that german praise they used to shout their Furher), you get as real to Adolf as you can. The guy was really sick by the way, and he needed a haircut!

The Trials at Nuremberg and Nuremberg do cover some historical background about the tirals at the end of the war and the first discoveries of the Holocaust. Their failure to portray a single Nazi in the first, and too Hollywood for my taste on the later, prevent me from really recommending either one. If you have to choose, go for the fist one though.

Then there is Downfall.

An openning and closing sequence show real clips of an interview with Hitler's 1942-45 secretary and the movie is based on her account of the last days of her furher. But the movie goes beyond that to its credit and truth to its producer account on the special features, it covers the last days of the regime; showing in detail the outcome of each one of the people that Mrs. Secretary shared those last days with. She suvived the war and the discovery of her bosse's handy work.

One of the highlights of the movie is an Oscar-caliber portrayal of Adolf and the excellent desicion of the actor to show its portrayee as a real human being. The actor summarizes this point in the Special Features by concluding that previous impersonations by Sir Alec Guiness and Sir Anthony Hopkins failed to show the real Hitler by satanizing him. This movie shows Hitler with a more realistic perspective: A German dictator that to his last minute was convinced that he had served the human race by getting rid of the jewish people. Whether he was demmented or dilussional was beyond the fact that he was still a human beign and very much aware that he was going to be served in a platter by the Russians two blocks away.

What do you at that point in time? In his case he chooses to continue his killing spree by ordering every surviving defector to be shot, (including his fiancee's brother in law,) the destruction of his own country (there was really not much left anyway) and ultimately gets married. He spent his short honey moon in his room shooting Mrs. Eva Brown Hitler and himself.

I can't say there is a single bad performance except for Mr. Goring's impersonator; who really does not have any dialog (he ultimatedly surrended to the Americans and then commited suicide in his cell.) He just did not have the precence of the real general, that's all...

What distinghishes this movie from all the rest is the truth to the fact aspect of every dialog and setting. According to the producers they went into great pains to get each account right including the bunker's installations. They must have gotten it right as those meeting halls were really small for the once ruler of much of Europe.

The movie is available in German with English subtitles and for the first part, I could not agree more. There should not be any historical movie about their subjects in any other language than their own. This is a clear prove of that and the movie gains so much realism for that single fact. If you want to see and English speaking Adolf, buy The Bunker!

There are some very good reviews about the movie already posted here, and I congratulate all the other reviewers for providing so many facts about them... specially the guy who wrote all of Gooble's concuvines names. Wow, that was really important. What is also important is to let you know that the movie does have some very disturbing scenes and should not be watched by everybody. Nevertheless that really did happen and the movie presents those scenes in exactly that manner: to what lenghts people went to in that particular time in that part of the world.

This is one of the best movies about the war and gets to that point by portraying the other side of the coin; the attackers now on the run and their last days in office. If I have to leave just one movie in my collection, I would not have second thoughts about this one. Maybe the academy should have done the same thing.",1126396800,5,4807,4.5392609699769055

Due to this movie being in German, I thought it gave it more of an actual feel of the Third Reich.  I was a bit disappointed with Eva Braun - acting was good, but I really didn't think she was fit for the role.  I also would've been more satisfied if the movie was from Hitler's point of view rather than Traudle Junge and Professor Schenke.  Overall, it had quite good characterization.  Bruno Ganz as Hitler was an ideal match. Josef Goebbels and Magda Goebbels have a very important part and their subplot was quite strong.  The movie was great, however, I do feel, that the movie depicts an easy, loose feeling among the Nazis when the Russians were only less than a few kms away - especially with all the partying and drinking.",1126310400,3,826,4.430463576158941

The only flaw was the account concerning Albert Speer. History has recorded that the actions in Downfall were not what actually occurred.

The movie really starts about 10 days before the fall of Berlin.  Although, there is a brief scene before that where Hitler hires his secretary.  In the point where the movie really starts, we see an aged Hitler who looks like he's been through alot (which he has).  The information he is getting from his people is bad and he's moving imaginary divisions.

There were strong performances all around, especially by the person who played Hitler.  You could see the dispair, exasperation and everything else in his mannerism.  You also had the sense of the inevitable.  It gave a more human dimension to a figure who isn't often portrayed as such.  In that, it made all that did seem that much worse because he knew what he was doing.

Anyways, I thought this was an all around good movie.",1126137600,2,1060,4.515789473684211

We get to see the range of ""believers"" following Hitler to the end, from the brain-washed to the disillusioned and those inbetween.

The film has stirred up contraversy because it shows Hitler for the man he was, both the insane, obsessed madman and the soft hearted gentleman he was to his non-military staff.  The movie is a chilling insight into the Nazi mind, and shows a perspective never seen before. It does stick to the truth, at least as told by Hitler's last secretary who spent the last few weeks with him.  Excellent!

2151878,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is an excellent film. Add it to your collection - it will become a classic.

There have been portrayals of the subject matter before, but there has always been a tendency to portray the Nazi leaders as stage villains - evil, ranting, woodwork-chewing monsters. This is a comforting but dangerous practice; by demonizing such people we distance ourselves from them, and lose sight of the fact that they were, in fact, people, just like us. People are capable of some pretty nasty things, given half a chance.

Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler is the portrayal of a human being, not a movie monster. I understand that he based Hitler's mode of speech on a recording made when he was at a social function, rather than the usual rally rhetoric, so we hear what he actually sounded like, rather than the usual bark. He also gives us a glimpse of the charisma that impressed all who met Hitler on a personal basis, and of the devotion he invoked among his staff. The earlier scenes around the dinner table in the bunker were quite cosy, with everyone sitting politely as Hitler droned on about his views on vegetarianism (or genocide).

But as the days passed, as the Third Reich finally collapsed, Hitler's reaction was a chilling picture of a leader with loyalty only to himself and his 'vision', and no empathy whatsoever for his people. I can think of a few examples in our world today.

There are many chilling images in this film:

Frau Goebbels leading a choir of her angelic little blonde children, then when all was lost, calmly poisoning them rather than expose them to a world without National Socialism.

The senseless slaughter of Germans by Germans for 'fraternizing', even as the Russian troops entered Berlin.

The hospitals ignored in the evacuation, full of dead and dying.

This isn't always an easy film to watch, but it's an important history lesson.

Strongly recommended.",1125878400,7,1893,4.8
2151879,5,B0002Z16HY,"There will most likely never be a better film made about the subject of Hitler.  This film is incredibly well done.  The cinematography is unbelievable, the acting is amazing by the entire cast especially Bruno Ganz and the actresses playing Eva Braun and his secretary (using the clips from Blind Spot was a masterstroke).  The score was also quite good and the writing was superb throughout.  I found the film gripping from start to finish and I would definitely watch it again.  The element of it that I believe I most appreciated was its uncompromising portrayal of the people surrounding Hitler as the time just before his death(suicide)in the bunker.  This movie really makes you feel like you're there...You feel their sense of dread and loss.  Its a film that leaves you with many conflicting emotions.  One of the most haunting lines in the film is one that Hitler himself has where he basically implies in no uncertain terms that it isn't so much his fault that things happened as they did as it was the German people for going along with it and allowing it to happen.  He basically says the German people cut their own throats.  Listening to Hitler saying something like that is some powerful and riveting stuff...Its an honest, gutsy albeit controversial approach/statement that sets the film apart from many other films of its type.  There is no sugar coating here or beating around the bush and its particularly admirable in that this was entirely a german production.  You could almost think of it as if germans from the time like Hitler's secretary said you know what we screwed up big time and we better accept responsibilty for our actions and never forget what we did to so many innocent Jews and the stain we've left on our country's history.  Its not in any way that you feel sympathy for Hitler as some reviewers have suggested as it is you get an idea of what psychologically was going through people's heads during that time...And it can be quite a disturbing and despicable experience watching these people love and honor their Fuhrer so much.  But without a doubt it is a brilliantly directed thought provoking motion picture and one with core themes that we should never forget and that we are unfortunately dealing with today in this county (The U.S.) I am saddened to say.  But I'll refrain from going there...Just see the movie.  Also...It would make an effective double feature with Werner Herzog's film Invincible.  Some other films I'd highly recommend that deals with the same time period are Fasbsinder's BRD Trilogy (all three of the films in this Criterion collection are nothing but pure filmmaking genius), Verhoeven's Soldier Of Orange (a stunning film), Das Boot by Wolfgang Peteresen, All Quiet On The Western Front and a personal favorite of mine The Young Lions.",1125705600,2,2806,4.836820083682008
2151880,5,B0002Z16HY,"FROM AN EMAIL TO MY FRIENDS: You know I usually write my cute little movie reviews, but instead I'll just tell you that last weekend I watched one of the BEST movies I've ever seen, but I doubt that many of you will rush right out and rent it because of the subject matter.

The movie's title is ""DOWNFALL"" and I believe that it came out earlier this year. Why is it so good? Absolutely stellar production, masterful directing and nearly flawless portrayals by the cast.  There has probably never been a film to exceed the commitment made to realism and most of the action was documented in writing by people who were there. Some of the cast of characters are still alive today.

What will turn most people off is the fact that it is
 a.) a history
b.)it is a ""war"" movie, and
 c.) it's about Hitler.

Actually that's misleading, the film is about the final few days of the Third Reich and all that entails. The script is based on the diary and journals of a few of those who lived to tell the tale, but primarily based upon the writings of one of Hitler's personal secretaries, a young girl of 22 when she went to work for him in 1943, I believe it was.

The film was made by a German crew (directed by a brilliant fellow named Oliver Hirschbeigel) in Germany and Russia, the cast is German, and the language of the film is German as well. If you don't think you want to bother with subtitles I would remind you of how good (and what a huge surprise of a hit) was the film Das Boot a few years back.

I've seen at least two other movies over the years based on this scenario, one starring Alec Guinness and the other with Anthony Hopkins. Neither film was particularly impressive and both had rather obvious ""agenda's"".

This version is likely the final word on the subject and its relation to film.

DOWNFALL was criticized because it adds a human dimension to people whom we would rather not think of as flesh and blood, but it is mesmerizing to watch this saga unfold and to know that it is probably as close to the horror of being there as can be achieved 50+ years after the fact.

There are several small subplots, one concerning a young boy in the Hitler Youth, as well as a particularly horrifying yet poignant scene involving Magda Goebbels helping to kill her children, to SAVE them from having to live in a world without Der Fuhrer.

This film was---and is---something of a political ""hot potato"" and there was some doubt that it would ever be licensed in Germany and several other European locations. Some theatres refused to run it at all.

It is gut wrenching on several levels and, again, brilliantly portrayed.

First off I'm a fan of history, a fan of great films and great stories, and a stickler for detail when it comes to the movies. Again, if I were giving stars I think this one would be a full house, 5 out of 5.

Check it out.

2151881,4,B0002Z16HY,"The last throes of the Third Reich is indeed weighty subject matter fraught with potential pitfalls of political in-correctedness, but German Director Oliver Heirschbegel does a faithful job to dramatize the history that really needs no fictional dramatization.  Seeing ""Downfall,"" is worth your while.

It has been said that ""Downfall,"" is really directed at a German audience and would only appeal to such.  I am American and lived in Germany for 3 and a half years, find World War II interesting, but wouldn't consider myself a Nazi history buff...but still found this movie engaging from start to finish.  The nation and culture of Germany has seemed to go through a process of openly confronting their history through the arts while still putting in place national laws that make such things as the Nazi Swastika an illegal symbol.  You can even see the Olympia Stadion bell in Berlin and touch the metal where the original swastika was filled in.  So ""Downfall,"" seems to be an important film in that it is another outlet for confronting the history of Hitler and the atrocities committed by the Third Reich openly and frankly.

Hitler and Goebells aren't necessarily demonized though their destructive and inhumane thoughts come through.  Though the ideas, plans, and implementation of those plans were indescribably unjust and wrought inexcusable evil and destruction in Germany and around the world, the film reminds us that we are viewing a depiction of people with terrible terrible thoughts that lead them to terrible actions.  This is a good perspective to keep in mind for modern times when a majority of the world is caught up in this ""global war on terrorism,"" being waged by people with their own brand of philosophy on both sides.

There are some wonderfully powerful performances in ""Downfall.""  Bruno Ganz does a phenomenal job at what must have been a tough performance to capture the ferocity of a character like Hitler but still to be able to depict him as a complex human.  Some parts truly stand out.  Hitler's rage and railing at most all those around him placing blame everywhere else but himself for the country falling into utter destruction and ruin.  Ganz as Hitler gives a cool testament dictated to secretary Traudl Junge that through it all he remains most proud of his efforts to enact racial genocide against ""Jewry.""  It is with this detached statement and performance that the horror of who Hitler was and what he believed in comes through.  For that alone, it firmly imprints in the mind the Holocaust Musuem's motto of ""lest we forget,"" and should be required viewing by policy makers and diplomats the world over.

Another strong performance is turned in by the actor and actresses playing Joseph and Magda Goebells.  The film shows to the extent how blind loyalty leads two people to unfathomable personal evil.  The most jaundiced viewer will have a difficult time watching the decision and actions taken by the Goebells to kill their children instead of facing a world living without National Socialism.  This provides one of the most powerful frontline anecdotals imaginable to speak to how evil can be institutionalized to the point that individuals no longer think for themselves and a cult of personality leads to the demise of a country and their populace.

I would recommend ""Downfall,"" highly to most anyone.  It's a long-ish movie clocking in at just shy of 2 hours and half so be prepared to be watching for awhile and of course the material is very sobering.  I would recommend other movies and books to get a more complete understanding of Germany during World War II and how the country dealt with the aftermath.  Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful are two films powerful in their depiction of the Nazi Germany, but read as well Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Gunther Grass's trilogy starting with ""The Tin Drum, and to round it off try tackling Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow.""  These would just be for starters if you become a serious student of the history.  I've heard Hitler's Willing Executioners by Goldhagen is a good one to read as well.

2151882,5,B0002Z16HY,"I believe that this is the first German film to deal with the problem of Hitler.  Independent/Foreign Film icon, Bruno Ganz, gives one of his best performances as the increasingly insane Fuhrer.  Hitler, in this movie, is human and frail, but still a monster.  His random acts of kindness are all the more grotesque.  Even at the end, he congratulates himself on his courage in dealing with ""the Jewish problem.""

The movie is book-ended with clips of Hitler's real-life secretary, who appears as a young girl in the film.  Most of the movie is seen through her eyes - from her first job interview with Hitler at the age of twenty-two, to the final days in the bunker.

The movie feels so authentic it is almost a docu-drama.  A series of titles at the end shows what happened to each of the characters - a surprising number of them led incredibly long lives.  We get to meet most of the characters in the bunker, which seems like a version of Hell.  The most illuminating character is Eva Braun: she actually has a feisty personality.  What does she see in Hitler?  What, in fact, does anyone see in Hitler?  At a time when he is clearly insane, commanding make-believe armies, and doing everything wrong, his supporters cling to him all the stronger, as if he were capable of leading them away from this horror.",1125187200,4,1313,4.583690987124464
2151883,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" depicts the turmoil, delusion, and despair of the last 12 days of the Third Reich in the ""Fhrerbunker"",  where Adolph Hitler and some of the Nazi elite sat out the Soviet assault on Berlin in April 1945, 10 meters beneath the Reich Chancellery. This account of events in the bunker is based on the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest, on Traudl Junge's eyewitness account in ""Until the Final Hour"", written with Melissa Mller, on the autobiographies of Dr. Ernst-Gnther Schenck, and on other eyewitness accounts. Traudl Junge was Adolph Hitler's private secretary and one of few surviving witnesses to his last days. She spoke candidly of the harrowing final days in the Chancellery in the 2002 documentary film ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"", and ""Downfall"" uses her character as a perspective through whom we see the others, particularly Hitler and Eva Braun. Traudl Junge is not strong character, yet she is featured prominently in the midst of much stronger personalities. Actress Alexandra Maria Lara does an impressive job of keeping the audience interested in her.

""Downfall"" opens in November 1942, as 22-year-old Traudl Humps gets a job as dictation secretary to Adolph Hitler. The film then jumps to Hitler's 56th birthday on April 20, 1945. Traudl has married in the interim years, although no mention is made of it. Her name in now Junge. Hitler (Bruno Ganz) has ordered ""Clausewitz"" in effect, so all government offices and departments are evacuating Berlin, leaving the city to bedlam and the civilians at the mercy of starvation and the advancing Soviet army. Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethan), among others, urges Hitler to leave Berlin, but he refuses. Dr. Ernst-Gnther Schenck (Christian Berkel) is running around trying to get support for the plight of civilians and wounded. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel places the audience in the middle of this chaos without explanation. The film has a quasi-documentary quality, and it does not create a context for the events that we see, nor does it introduce the characters. It just plunges right in. I think that this technique ultimately heightens feelings of confusion and madness, to ""Downfall""'s benefit, but it can sometimes be frustrating. Anyone who is not familiar with the major players in the history of the Third Reich will have trouble figuring out who is who, because most characters are never clearly identified.

When ""Downfall"" moves to the Fhrerbunker, we find an unhinged Adolph Hitler. The Fhrer is more hysterical and irrational than usual, can't keep track of his armies, insists that Germany can win the war, and refuses to allow civilians to evacuate the city. Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is frightened and horrified by what she sees but usually calm and consistent in her dictation duties. We observe the conflicts between the generals and SS officers who remain faithful to Hitler's orders and those who wish to act independently, in particular SS-Gruppenfhrer Hermann Fegelein (Thomas Krestchmann), the playboy brother-in-law of Eva Braun, who was loyal to Himmler. We see Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War, refuse to carry out Hitler's scorched earth policy. But more interesting than the politics of the Reich's last days are its personalities. Adolph Hitler is delusional, blaming everyone but himself for Germany's imminent defeat. Eva Braun (Juliane Khler) is ever the party girl. Josef Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) are fanatical to a fault and contemptuous of Germans. There is constant talk of suicide and cyanide capsules.

""Downfall"" periodically focuses its attention on the streets above, where the brutal battle for Berlin wages on. The desperate attempts by a brave but defeated army to defend Berlin are gut-wrenching, no matter what side you are on. The character of 12-year-old  Peter Ganz (Donevan Gunia) is intended to be representative of the very young soldiers recruited into the Hitlerjugend in the last days of the war. He is not a real person. ""Downfall"" makes me wonder how Traudl Junge and the German people could not have noticed that their leaders were stark-raving mad, but I suppose loony politicians are not unusual. I have never understood Adolph Hitler's charisma, and this doesn't help. But Oliver Hirschbiegel and the film's cast have done a great job of bringing the emotions in the Chancellery and on the streets of Berlin in April 1945 to the audience. The film has no score. The 20 rooms of the bunker were recreated as realistically as possible. We are dropped into this tense environment, where the Nazi elite and their staff awaited their doom, practically entombed in 4 meters of concrete already.  ""Downfall""'s realism, painstaking accuracy, and delicate performances are an extraordinary accomplishment that make this a masterpiece among war films. In German with English subtitles.

The DVD (Columbia Tristar 2005): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, interviews, and an audio commentary. ""The Making of Downfall"" (1 hour) features interviews with the director, much of the cast, and some others who are not identified, but may be the screenwriter and a historian. The director talks about why he chose to make the film and what he wanted to convey. The actors discuss their characters. And there is a segment about filming in St. Petersburg, Russia.  ""Cast and Crew Interviews"" includes interviews with director Oliver Hirschbiegel (4 min.), author Melissa Mller (8 min.), and actors Bruno Ganz (6 min.), Alexandra Maria Lara (2 min.), and Juliane Khler (2  min.). Some of the interviews are repeated from the documentary, but I recommend the one with Mller. The documentary and interviews are in German with English subtitles. The audio commentary by director Oliver Hirschbiegel is in English. He provides a lot of additional historical details about locations, characters, background, and situations, expounding on each scene.  I highly recommend the commentary.",1125100800,3,6017,5.2518210197710715

2151895,5,B0002Z16HY,"Film maker Oliver Hirschbiegel undertook  a challenging subject.  There are some historic public figures whose movie portrayals are traditionally viewed as taboo.  Any film that attempts to depict Adolf Hitler as something other than an obvious demented evil demon runs the risk of being shunned.  Much as SCHINDLER'S LIST was a ""must see"" for an accurate portrayal of one of the most horrific events of modern history, so is its concluding chapter in DOWNFALL.

What do you find in DOWNFALL?  For World War Two historians you will not discover anything new that you have not already read in John Toland's books THE LAST HUNDRED DAYS or ADOLF HITLER, Cornelius Ryan's THE LAST BATTLE, or dozens of other books about the fall of the Third Reich.  In fact, as far as the sequence of events in the film, you pretty much know what is coming from General Steiner's failed relief attempt, Himmler's negotiations with Count Bernodette, Fegeleins execution, Ritter von Greim's daring flight into the besieged city, and so on.  There is no new historically revealing information.  The story has the same tragic ending.

What you will experience is a brilliantly directed drama about the last ten days of the Third Reich in Berlin's government district.  The film has been meticulously researched and is based on secretary Traudl Junge's memoirs, as well as Joachim Fest's best selling book.  This movie adds depth to the characters.  These are not simply goose-stepping robots merrily marching toward oblivion.  In fact, many of the key characters find themselves at torn between loyalty to the Fuehrer and the overwhelming need to extricate themselves from the madness.  Even Traudl Junge, masterfully portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara, cannot explain why she is voluntarily drawn to remain in the Bunker until the end.

Actor Bruno Ganz accepted a bit of a gamble in portraying Adolf Hitler.  It took quite a lot of professional courage to take on the role of one of the most hated personalities in history.  His performance is magnificent.  Everything I ever read about the last days of Hitler are manifest in Ganz's performance from the haggard look, uncontrollable hand spasms, and stooped posture - yet remaining the undisputed German commander in chief until his self inflicted demise.

The exterior scenes of the movie were filmed in, of all places, St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Russia due to that city's architectural similarity to Berlin.  The sets, costuming(uniforms), props and ordnance are outstandingly accurate and match newsreels and still photos of that dark period.  The film is captured from the German point of view.  The Red Army's presence is reminded primarily by artillery barrages and occasional firefights with distant Soviet soldiers.

Despite the historical accuracy of DOWNFALL, it is not a docudrama.  Unlike excellent battle films like TORA, TORA, TORA, this film does not offer much in the way of superimposed titles to introduce characters or locations.  You will have to listen to the dialogue or read the subtitled translations to place some of the names.

This is the absolutely the best film rendition of the last days of the Third Reich in Berlin.  Previous film makers tried, and failed, to capture the emotion and tradgedy linked to the death of the Nazi regime.  As such, it is important to compare DOWNFALL to earlier cinematic attempts.

HITLER, THE LAST TEN DAYS, was too much like a claustrophobic one act play.  Based on Hugh Trevor-Roper's best selling book, the film deviated from the well researched volume and interjected useless dialogue to pad the film's script.  Though I give Alec Guinness credit for his portrayal of Adolf Hitler, by the end of the movie Hitler's character quickly devolves into an exaggerated comic book version of the German leader.  In LAST TEN DAYS, the final scene of Hitler and Eva Braun is so contrived that it wrests credibility from the rest of the film.

Kudos go to the television movie, THE BUNKER.  THE BUNKER, which closely followed O'Donnell's outstanding nonfiction book of the same name, was really the first modern attempt to accurately capture the last desperate days in the Fuehrer Bunker.  Anthony Hopkins, in an Emmy winning role, did a superb job as Hitler.  Producers of THE BUNKER went all out recreating photographically familiar facades of the chancellory, bunker's interior, emergency exit, and torn up chancellory gardens.  If THE BUNKER had any flaws at all, it was probably that its budget was limited to that of a television movie and that all of the actors were either British or American.  Additionally, one of the harshest criticisms of the television movie was that it spent so much time on Albert Speer.  Though no one will ever know for sure, Speer's rendition of the last days of the Third Reich have sometimes been viewed as self-serving at best, revisionist at worst.

Speaking of Albert Speer, let us not forget Rutger Hauer's portrayal of the Reich Minister for Armaments in INSIDE THE THIRD REICH.  Strictly speaking, INSIDE THE THE THIRD REICH was a movie about Albert Speer ending with his last visit to the Fuehrer Bunker.  Again, and depending on your point of view, INSIDE THE THIRD REICH, both movie and Albert Speer's best selling autobiography, are either the definitive story of one man's witness to the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, or the unabashed rewriting of history by a man who was lucky to get away with 20 years in prison.  However, one thing you cannot deny is that Albert Speer was actually present during the some of the last days in Berlin.

Finally, I have to mention the pitiful segment regarding the bunker segment in the 1989 television mini series WAR AND REMEMBERANCE.  If ever there was a twisted  rendition of the last moments in Berlin, it was represented in this film.

DOWNFALL is vastly superior to earlier attempts to describe Hitler's final days.

There were a several technical aspects of the DVD that surprised me. The version I purchased was definitely crafted for an American audience.  I fully expected the dialogue to be in German, but did not expect English subtitles to automatically be superimposed over the lower portion of the picture.  I would rather the subtitles be optional - or appear in the lower letterbox portion of the screen.  Unfortunately, there is no on or off feature for the subtitles.  Unlike DAS BOOT, which offers a selection of German  or English dubbing, DOWNFALL is in German only.  Even though the dialogue is in German, the movie credits are in English.

Overall, this is a great film that accurately recreates the final days of the Nazi regime in Berlin.  The mix of the real-life characters and events keeps the story interesting.  I only regret that I was unable to see this movie when it first premiered in a limited number of obscure theaters across the United States.  A great movie always loses something when shown someplace other than a cinema auditorium.",1124755200,3,6942,4.980886185925282
2151896,4,B0002Z16HY,"Hardly what I'd call entertaining, this movie played like a docudrama, based upon real events and facts, the film obviously had to fill in the blanks in many places, but my opinion was that it probably showed fairly accurately what happened in the final days before the fall of Berlin.  While again, not what I'd like to call ""entertainment"" the film was both interesting and fascinating.

I'm assuming that for those that speak German, this movie was well acted.  I can't really say for certain myself, having to follow the subtitles, but I'd probably concur.  It seemed authentic.  I don't think that this film could be dubbed into English very well, it'd probably play like a spoof.  In any case, subtitles aside, for those interested in this part of history, I'd recommend the movie.

Keep in mind this isn't a story, per se, like Saving Private Ryan or that Russian sniper flick that was pretty decent (brain fade here on the name) there is no ""hero"" no protagonist really, and really nothing redemptive about it say like in Schindler's List, where among all the horrible and tragic things happening, there is shown some good, a man standing up for good in the middle of total evil.  However, that being said, there is always something instructive about  the past, and therein lies the value in the movie, even if it doesn't make us feel good watching it.

While there is some gore (and some minor nudity) I'd not hesitate to allow teenagers to see this if they were interested in history and I could use the movie as a starting point for discussion, however, I'd not bother (or perhaps allow) the younger set to see this as a ""movie"" i.e. for entertainment.

As for owning or renting it, well for me, I can't imagine wanting to see it again, however, I'm not disappointed in viewing it once and I think I learned a few things.",1124668800,2,1832,4.6234567901234565
2151897,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is an outstanding movie in terms of bringing the past to life.  While nothing in the film takes away from the image of Hitler as a crazy madman, it also gives us an image of the person of Hitler.  We see a very selfish man who is struggling to come to grips with his rapidly approaching destiny.  Although he is only concerned with himself, he still needs the approval of others.  That is why he can order the deaths of millions of people, including his own, but yet still present a friendly face for those in his circle; at least until his next uncontrolled outburst.

While the film appears to be told from the viewpoint of his secretary, it is ultimately all about one of the most evil men of the 20th century, at least in deed if not mind as well.  If the film does have a shortcoming, it is that it gives his secretary a free pass regarding any type of moral judgment.  How could someone serve as Hitler's assistant for 3 years and still avoid any type of negative portrayal in a film?

This is a very well made production with strong acting performances all around.  I highly recommend this film, even to those who are not fans of history.",1124668800,,1150,4.336448598130841
2151898,4,B0002Z16HY,"Hitler may have been an extreme case but the drama here is more how his supporters were so fanatic and misguided and how rare was independent rational perspective - especially during the last days of the regime.

A mother poisoning all her children then comitting suicide with her husband; Hitler's willingness to condemn all Germans to their fate for failure and supposed disloyalty; young children fighting to the death as Russians entered Berlin -- why? Are Germans so different or is it ""circumstances""?

The horror of blind nationalism, war, following leaders who are crazed by their conviction that God is on their side (the study of Hitler's library and the marginal notes shows how ""Christian"" were his convictions and plan for a 1000 year Reich belied by those who choose to see him as Pagan).

There are lessons for George's America and for all time in a history too readily dismnissed as someone else's.

Because of the Holocaust we tend to forget the banality of the rest of the evil of the Reich and decieve ourselves about the timeliness of its lessons today.",1124496000,4,1073,4.8469945355191255
2151899,5,B0002Z16HY,"Deserving of all the praise, this beautifully researched and executed film is a combination war film/docudrama that carefully and responsibly chronicles not only Hitler's final days as the Fuhrer, but the literal demise of the Third Reich as Berlin succombed to the Russian forces.

The strengths of this marvelous, important film come not only in the detailed accuracy of its script but in the inspired detail in every department: cinematography, wardrobe, makeup, effects, sound and especially CASTING.  Every part is played to frightening perfection, especially (in my opinion) Speer, Eva Braun, the Goebbels family and, of course Bruno Ganz's amazing depiction of Hitler.

The bonus features, while not plentiful, are worthy of the film itself and the director's commentary (in English) especially interesting and insightful.

One to own and view in rememberance of the terrible time in our not-so-distant past.  Important not only to remember for the sake of history, but to avoid repeating the mistakes of blindly following a charismatic leader.

2151900,2,B0002Z16HY,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Acting is impressive (even if the actors impersonating the German generals - in the German version - are unable to reproduce the hard, metal-like Prussian cadence), special effects are well-made, and it nicely conveys the depressive and claustrophobic feeling of the cramped life in the bunkers. It also conveys an adequate feeling of war's brutality.

The plot refrains from the most obtuse stereotypes of anti-National Socialist propaganda, and truly depicts some human sides of Hitler and his entourage. However, like any movie produced under the regime imposed by the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of both world wars, it remains a very unbalanced representation of reality, intended to impress the viewer's mind with political and ideological prejudices.

To this goal the movie producers make high-powered use of stereotypization, one of the controlled medias' strong points. All Nazi characters wishing to carry on the fight - from high-ranking SS officials to Hitlerjugend kids fighting on the barricades - always fall in one of two stereotypes, either that of the unthinking, automaton soldier speaking in a machine-like way, or that of the equally unthinking, naive kid automatically, almost unconsciously repeating the slogans impressed upon him. On the contrary, all characters purporting a quick surrender are represented as wise and judicious individuals, speaking in warm overtones from the wealth of their life experience.

The movie's worst aspect consists in its portrayal of Hitler. Instead of depicting the dialectics of rigorous lucidity and rambling illusions, of stern self-control and furious outbursts that characterized the dictator's last days, the film brings to life a maniacal old man who has lost all contacts with reality. In this movie Hitler is no religious prophet and political genius, partially broken by the immensity of defeat and bad health conditions, but a madman babbling his nonsense to an audience so narrow-minded and subservient as not to see its obvious foolishness - a poor travesty of historical reality. For example, Goebbels (the brilliant intellectual who largely reinvented propaganda) is depicted as no more than a loyal moron dog.

Whenever Bruno Ganz enunciates one of Hitler's most infamous (to the believers in the political religion of human rights and racial equality) precepts, he always does so in an especially rambling and stuttering way, and such principles are extrapolated from their context, to produce an impression of bleakness and near-madness. This tendency is made obvious in the scene where Hitler dictates his political testament: since there was no way to twist the text in the byproduct of an impoverished mind, we are just allowed to hear its first few words, then the scene is quickly shifted.

In other cases this approach leads to historical falsification -it happens in the allucinatory depiction of the degenerate parties supposedly held by the Nazi entourage, or in the the scene where Hitler is asked what to do in case ammunition is entirely spent. Fest, in his ""Hitler. Eine Biographie"", unequivocally states that the dictator answered that in this case defenders should try to flee by small groups, while in the movie Ganz madly waves his one good fist and mumbles: ""I shall never capitulate, never!""...

The movie makers' tendentious intentions are made even more plain in the final scene, where a smiling Frau Junge travels away with a newly found stray kid, and the clouds part in the far skies, to impress on the viewer the idea that a nightmare is now over, and that a new and better age is starting for the survivors of Nazi madness. The short interview to the real Frau Junge, which is incorporated in the end segment, makes the movie's political underground impossible to miss. This movie does not attempt to impress viewers with problems and interrogations, encouraging them to work out answers of their own; instead it strives to impose its own answers, defaming the National Socialist world view.

All this notwithstanding the apprehensions expressed by some members of the Establishment, that this movie could mitigate the effect of regime antifascist propaganda, are in my opinion justified: as the movie slanders National Socialism in a less coarse and loud way than usual, it shall be probably able to impress the herd's minds with lesser force.

Finally, this movie is probably the best that can be filmed on this subject under the present political regime; it has several bonus points, yet each viewer, especially young viewers, should go to the box-office conscious of its preposterous background.",1124323200,27,4636,5.255405405405406
2151901,5,B0002Z16HY,"I never understood why this film caused so much controversy in Germany. It was about about time that the Germans examine their own history and the most notorious leader of the 20th Century. Because the controversy surrounded the portrayal of Hitler as a real human being who could pet a dog one minute, while ordering other people's death the next; or who was kind to his secretary even while he yelled tirades against his staff of military men for their incompetence...I actually expected to see more of Hitler's ""nice side."" The controversy was nothing but overbloated talk, as this film clearly portrays Hitler as the monster he is. If people don't understand that humans are often contradictory and capable of showing kindness to some people while ordering massive death for complete strangers...then they really don't understand human nature. Just because one shows Hitler as a complex, contradictory human being doesn't soften his reputation. So he was kind to dogs. So he was a gentle boss to his secretary. So what? This film doesn't excuse the fact that he was still a monster of a human being.

The actor who portays him is so uncanny in his physical likeness that I did wonder how people might act towards him after this role. The film is so compelling and disturbing to watch...for the same reason as I remain clueless as to how anyone could follow and be loyal to this man's evil vision to the very end. Perhaps the most disturbing part of all is the beautiful, elegant, upper middle class lady Magda Goebbels who decides to poison her six blue-eyed, blond-haired Aryan children because she didn't want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. She does the deed with such cool, creepy finesse that it downright shocks the viewer just how much the Nazi movement resembles a doomsday cult, complete down to the charismatic leader.

After watching this film, as great as it is, I didn't think I'd want to see it again. However, a few days later, I was still thinking about this film and will probably buy it on DVD at some point. It is something that should be seen by all and seen a few times. For one reason, reading subtitles throughout the film only makes me miss some of the facial expressions of the various people. I do like that we get the authenticity of a German-language movie about the last ten days of the Third Reich, but an English language track would have been nice so I could watch it in English once while I concentrate on the images and expressions that I miss when trying to read subtitles. Anyone interested in WWII history, history in general, or totalitarian systems/cults should definitely see this film. After I watched it, I wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" and ""Band of Brothers"" again, as well as picking up my long postponed plan to read ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."" This film belongs in that canon of extraordinary work, capturing the chaos of a collapsing government, a ruined nation, and a group of leaders who preferred to commit suicide than face punishment for the evil they unleashed on the world. They knew the Soviets would be harsher in retributive punishment than the Americans. An excellent lesson in history grounded in realism.",1124323200,4,3208,4.757630161579892
2151902,5,B0002Z16HY,"Der Untergang (Downfall) is one of the best damn (or fluch, if you're German) foreign films these eyes have beheld in quite some time.

A gallant collaboration of German and Russian filmmakers, this is probably the most realistic (yet cinematically rich) portrayal of the last days of Adolf Hitler as seen through the eyes of his personal secretary Traudl Junge  ~ a lovely girl who finds herself in the Der Fuhrer's bunker surrounded by selbstmarderische Nazi enthusiasten (pistols and poison pellets) while Eva Braun parties like a crazed Joan Crawford. And Magda Goebbels---- wait! Don't want to tell you everything. Wouldn't want to spoil this film for those of you who are not all that familiar with some of the greatest horrors in history. But I must, at least, interject that the way the actress Corinna Harfouch plays it, Frau Goebbels comes off as one very scary Nazi bitch. (Makes Dr. Goebbels look almost like a pussycat in comparison  ~ that's IF pussycat is a scar-faced pyschopath. Achtung ~ meow!)

The amazing actor Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler as a (quote/unquote) ""human being"" will give your goose steps goose bumps. Simply put, it's riveting ... and will frighten you more than any other actor's ""monster-like"" portrayal. That's why it's so freaking scary. Something like this could happen right here in America. In fact, who knows? Perhaps it's already happening!

During his last hours in the bunker, and facing inevitable defeat, Hitler one moment perceives the citizens of Berlin as if they're nothing more than pissants upon a burning hill ~ yet he has these little Uncle Adolf moments; especially with the somewhat debateably innocent Fraulein Junge. Innocent only if you go by the rule of thumb (or swastika) that what you don't know can't hurt you  ~ but can kill over ten million innocent people. (Hitler would've liked it if, not unlike Las Vegas, what happens in the bunker stays in the bunker. But thanks to Fraulein Junge, the word got out eventually. And, for that, all humanity is thankful.)

I might also add that the direction is flawless. The production is dead accurate. (Dead being the proper adjective, don't you think?) The film sparkles, even in its darkest moments.

Ja, this is a must must-see.",1124323200,4,2249,4.946949602122016
2151923,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is a harrowing, must see picture. I like the Anthony Hopkins as Hitler movie ""The Bunker"" but this is just so much more profound - a must see. The most impressive movie I have seen in 2005.",1124236800,,194,4.131578947368421
2151924,5,B0002Z16HY,"Though I've never read the two books upon which this film was based, I came to it with a fairly comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. Those who are reading this already know what Downfall is about, so I won't rehash it here. What the film does is deepen our understanding of the human side of those most often parodied as monochromatic psychopaths. People are people, and as Hitler's former secretary Traudl Junge commented in the interviews that bookend the film, one can sometimes be led down a path with an end unimagineable when the journey began.

The whole gamut of human emotion and behavior is on display here as the Nazi leadership tries to cope with the realization that the end of their dream of a thousand year Reich is at hand. For every man and woman who bravely, resignedly, or stoically faces the end, there is a coward or a self-server who seeks to save only his own skin.

We see Hitler poring over maps, concocting strategies for armies that exist in name only. We see him rage at his generals, we see his tender relations with his closest associates, and we see him a tear rolling down his cheek when he comes to know that even Albert Speer, one of his closest advisers, had disobeyed his orders to institute a scorched earth policy as his armies are in retreat. We see him rationalize the destruction of German cities with the comment that it is easier to clear away debris than to tear down existing structures after the war is won in order to build a Germany filled with National Socialist architecture. The portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz is a rare masterpiece in that he brings home the essential humanity of a man concealed beneath a crushing burden of hatred. Many criticize the suicides of Hitler and others when failure was certain as the coward's way out, but suicide as redemption for failure was engrained in German/Austrian military culture long before Hitler came on the scene. Besides, Hitler knew what was likely in store should the Russians capture him and so as well did Eva Braun.

Other standout performances include the fetching Alexandra Maria Lara as the ingenue Traudl Junge (Humps), a Munich native who becomes Hitler's secretary. She often appears surprised and disbelieving at some of what she sees and hears, but remains a loyal employee to the end. There is a point when she is taking the dictation of Hitler's final Political Testament that the look on her face as she listens to Hitler says she wishes that he would quit ranting about the Jews. Lara's Junge actually comes off as a very normal kind, concerned, and loving woman.

Ulrich Matthes is chilling as the fanatic-to-the-end Joseph Goebbels as is Corinna Harfouch portraying his wife Magda. Goebbels seems to delight in the destruction of his country and when questioned about sending poorly-armed and unarmed elderly men and boys out to face the Russians, he coldly denies having any sympathy for them and says that the German people deserve their fate for giving them (the Nazis) a mandate. Matthes' portrayal of Goebbels seems to confirm author David Irving's assertion that Goebbels was the mastermind behind much of what was evil about the Nazi regime. Probably the only people that Goebbels loved besides Hitler are his ill-fated children and his wife Magda.

Harfouch's stone-faced Magda, who bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Hillary Clinton, is magnificent as a woman who after lengthy agonizing and rationalizing, very stoically did what she considered to be her duty in murdering her sleeping children in order to save them from the fate they most likely would have faced under the Russians and from life in a world without her beloved National Socialism. The scene is moving and painful. Make no mistake, she was not pleased with herself for what she did, nor was she pleased with her husband for making no effort to dissuade her. The Goebbels children are among the few besides civilian victims for which the viewer might feel sorry. Shortly after, Magda faced her own end with the same stony resignation as Goebbels kills her and then himself while the Russians close in.

Christian Berkel as SS Doctor Schenck stands out as a man whose concern for the civilian population, his tireless efforts to get food, medicine and other medical supplies for the helpless, and his heroic efforts at stopping roving death squads from murdering innocent civilians accused of desertion make him one of the few sympathetic adult characters in the movie.

I could go on, but you get the idea about what a brutally gripping film this is. Along with the main action, there are the sideshows: fanatical children ready to fight to the last ""man"", bewildered masses of displaced civilians, die-hard SS men threatening and in some case shooting any comrades who call for negotiated surrender, the never-ending tension in the fuehrer's bunker while the endgame plays itself out, the petty disobediences of party functionaries as awareness that the end is nigh sets in. One of the most striking scenes in the bunker is that of a drunken Eva Braun insisting that a bunker party continue after a close call with Russian artillery. She wants music, and when asked what kind, she calls  for forbidden ""degenerate"" swing music to be played while she clambers up on a table and dances with abandon.

Most viewers will want to watch Downfall several times to catch all the detail. There is so much to digest that several viewings are necessary for it all to sink in. The filmmakers worked hard to make the film as authentic as possible, right down to the uniforms. I have waited a long time for this to come out on DVD ever since a friend told me about seeing it in a Las Vegas art movie house. It was well worth the wait to me as I consider it to be one of the best films I've seen in years. If you have any love of history you should enjoy this film as well. Five stars are too few.",1124236800,3,5912,4.748782862706913
2151925,5,B0002Z16HY,"I was absolutely enraptured by Ganz's performance. Just seeing the previews gave me chills. When I finally saw the DVD I was absolutely taken aback at how amazingly he portrays such a reviled historical figure. He showed Hitler as both monster and human...capable of sheer ruthlessness, but you could also see how he had such devoted followers.",1124150400,3,344,5.052631578947368
2151926,5,B0002Z16HY,"How ""Downfall"" lost the best 2004 foreign film Oscar is as puzzling a question as how Germany lost World War II. In depicting the collapse of a psychotic dictator, it also details the demise of National Socialism and the transfixed personalities that enabled it. And it treats all this with an uncommon fidelity to fact, a feat of detection and dedication for which future researchers will be indebted, that is not to say moved and enthralled. It's not a pretty picture but it is a powerful one.

The filmmakers move between the melodrama in the besieged bunker, where Adolf Hitler and his cohorts are delusionally in command, to the anguish and chaos in the streets of Berlin. It is there that German soldiers and fleeing civilians encounter the advancing Russian ""liberators,"" armed resistance, and exploding bombs. The camera scrutinizes the lair-like claustrophobia of the Third Reich's last throes and the agony and bewilderment of those entangled in it.

Alec Guinness and Anthony Hopkins have played Hitler, but their performances pale beside that of Bruno Ganz, who now owns the role (an odd distinction for an actor.) Ganz gives us the humanity behind the horror, rendering the madman and his mission as weirdly comprehensible (Hannah Arendt's famous ""banality of evil."") As a result, some criticize Ganz's achievement and the picture itself as ""humanizing the inhuman."" Yet that is the very point the movie is making.

""Downfall"" is based partly on the memoirs of Hitler's young secretary, a major character in the film whose real-life persona is seen briefly commenting at the beginning and end. The director could have done a better job identifying the characters as they come and go (was that Martin Borman?), but the actors playing them couldn't be any better. This splendid DVD comes with a commentary tract and extras that are as engrossing as the film itself. Miss this one at your own risk.",1124150400,2,1908,5.012618296529968

If you are looking to be entertained in the traditional sense of movie going, well, then this movie is not for you. This is neither a Disney movie nor a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" However, if you want to better understand the German soul-searching that has been going on, since the end of the Third Reich and the Second World War, well, settle-in, you will certainly find this movie to be very exciting and informative. I think more than anything, this movie, as well as another German post war movie: Das Boot, is an attempt by the Germans themselves to better understand what happened, how did it happen and what it means to them as a people. The approach is honest, realistic and revealing. It is difficult to imagine more from a movie dealing with the period. Word of caution: much is lost in translation and this is a much better movie if you can manage to follow the German dialog. A must see!",1124064000,5,1009,4.549450549450549

2151929,5,B0002Z16HY,"In 1945, the remnants of the Third Reich were in the final hours of its death. The Russians were pounding Berlin from the land and air, as the once strong German Army scrambled to avoid annihilation. Adolph Hitler retreats into the confines of a bunker to spend his last few days with his mistress, generals, soldiers, fellow cabinent members and their families, and one Traudl Junge, his personal secretary. What follows is a fascinating, and what I consider to be a true horror story, about insanity, desparation, and the end result of hatred.

This movie is based on the works of two books, one of them authored by Traudl Junge, which gives this film an air of authenticity and realism that is haunting. Junge spoke as a witness to these events, and in fact, the real Junge bookends the film. Chosen out of five women to be Hitler's personal secretary, she was thrilled to be employed by the Furher, and worked very closely with him, even going so far as to enter the bunker with him and refusing to leave. Junge is never in conflict during the film about her role in the Nazi regime, nor ever questions anyone about the possible horrors that would surface; she claimed innocence. With the Russians pounding Berlin with artilery, and Hitler descending into insanity (ordering armies around that don't exist and talking about a great comeback), Junge realizes all is lost, and her decision is when to save herself.

The tour de force performance in this film is Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler with such realism that you cannot believe this is an actor. He captures Hitler when he is screaming at his generals is that is lifted right out of old films of Hitler speaking at large Nazi rallies, and captures a different man when dealing with people close to him.  It's his realism that is eerie; definitely a complex man so successful portrayed.

The other horrifying element in this film occurs later on, with Josef Goebbel's wife Magda's poisoning of her five children in the bunker after Hitler's suicide. After making her children drink a sleeping substance, she methodically and ruthlessly kills all of her children by making them bite glass capsules of poison. The scene was so amazingly powerful that I wanted to weep yet no tears came. It became an incredible image for the heartlessness of a regime so bent on perfection and courage, in a final act of desparation and weakness.

And don't worry: there is nothing in this film that attempts to glorify Hitler, or make him out to be anything that he wasn't. Even in moments that he treats Junge with compassion, the six million people he murdered are never far out of your mind. In fact, when his beloved dog Blondi is killed in the bunker, and Hitler tears up, you wonder how a man could feel so badly for a pet when he ordered the deaths of so many others. His wedding to Eva Braun is not touching or romantic, but a mere formality. It's amazing, to say the least, to watch someone unfold to frightening effects.

Junge went on to escape the bunker, and into a life of hiding, until coming out publicly about her role before her death in 2002. A documentary film was made about her life, in which she was interviewed about what she witnessed. I found Downfall to be the better movie, more thrilling, and ultimately more terrifying, than the documentary. I highly recommend Downfall.",1124064000,3,3338,4.687713310580205
2151930,5,B0002Z16HY,"The historical accuracy of this film, and brilliance of its direction and performances, make this a must for anyone interested in WWII. The last days of the Third Reich play out like a warped, insane version of Gotterdammerung, as Hitler keeps clinging to his dream of being a world conqueror. Bruno Ganz (remembered from the 1987 ""Wings of Desire"") is remarkable as Hitler; though there is little resemblance between them, Ganz has captured the strident voice, and the body language so well that he convinces us we are looking at the evil dictator.

The re-creation of a war-torn, devastated Berlin is extraordinary (most of it filmed in St. Petersburg), with the fantastic cinematography of Rainer Klausmann. Meticulous attention was paid to the costuming and the props, making sure each uniform was correct, as well as the weaponry, and the furniture in the claustrophobic bunker. Based on ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest, and ""Until the Final Hour"" by Traudi Junge and Melissa Muller, much of the film is seen through Junge's eyes, as she was hired as Hitler's secretary in 1942 and stayed with him through April '45. Fortunately for the director, many of the people depicted in this film, if they were not sentenced to death by the Nuremberg Trials, and survived the Soviet prison camps, lived very long lives, and were able to talk of their experiences.

All the great performances are too numerous to mention, but standouts are Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudi Junge, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, and in the one heroic part in the film, Christian Berkel shines as Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck. A surprising character in the last desperate days underground is Hanna Reich (Anna Thalbach), one of the most famous aviatrixes and test pilots in the world. Anyone who has seen the 1965 film ""Operation Crossbow"" will remember the depiction of her testing the V-1 Buzz Bomb. The only ""invention"" is little Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), who is a composite of all the children who fought in the final phases of the war.

This is a stunning film, and needs to be seen several times, as there are quick details that are passed over in the first viewing. Not to be missed is seeing it with director Oliver Hirschbiegel's commentary, and the ""Making of Downfall"" Special Feature is excellent, as well as the cast interviews. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film, it also has a subtle but beautiful score by Stephan Zacharias. Total running time is 156 minutes.",1123977600,5,2530,4.934272300469484

This film is an amazing adaptation of the Joachim Fest book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich. There are many instances in the film that are recreated verbatim from the book with close attention to histrorical accuracy. The cinematography and set design are terrific, but the movie truly shines in its portrayals of the main characters. The actors really inhabit these characters, especially Bruno Ganz as Hitler. The film demostrates very well the chaos of the final days of the Third Reich and the many dimensions of confict within the Fhrer Bunker in those final days. Hitler's desire to pull down the German nation and its people into a vortex of destruction rather than admit defeat, was never stronger than during these final days and this film brings home this reality in a viseral manner.

It was a definite pleasure, as usually most villains (historic or otherwise) are usually portrayed in films as some two-dimensional cardboard cutout, utterly lacking in empathy or any other human virtue.

2151944,5,B0002Z16HY,"Of course, this is not the first film that features Adolf Hitler in the center -- Charlie Chaplin did it.  Or, this is not the first film that shows the last days of his empire -- Obi Wan did it (no, not Ewan, I'm talking about Alec).  But seeing the downfall of Adolf Hitler speaking in his original language is something you should never miss, especially when he is played by Bruno Ganz.

In short, the title of 'Downfall' describes exactly what it is.  It's about the last days of Hitler and Nati, and like a big ship going down, the falling empire sucks many people deep into the dark void.  In this case, however, it's a mental one -- some try to maintain the order; some run away from reality (usual method, booze); or some just do nothing.  And Hitler?  Oh, you know his fate -- Eva Brown and lots of gasoline.

ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS about this film is the actors' uncanny resemblance.  The chillingly realistic portrayal of Hitler is done by German-speaking Bruno Ganz (though actually he is a Swiss), whose authentic image and mannerism as Adolf will stay with you long after leaving the theater.  (One irony is that ganz is best remembered by his turn as a winged angel in 'Wings of Desire' set in the same city -- Berlin).

Also, see the film's realistic Goebbels and Himler, and compare them with the real-life counterpart.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel (see his gripping prison thriller 'Das Experiment') surely did research.  In a sense, Goebbels and his wife (and children) offer the most unnerving scene in the film, which is, I am afraid, very painful to watch.

Though it is obvious that Hitler plays the pivotical role in 'Downfall,' the film is in fact about everyone, soldiers or civilians, who surrounded him in the last days of the Third Reich.  The film starts with memoirs narrated by a secretary Traudi Junge hired by Hitler himself, but soon we realize that the film has multi-layered stories that concern all the people in Berlin.  And it also concerns their downfall.

Some words about the negative reviews on political ground.  Some blames the filmmaker for ignoring the fate of Jewish people.  The fact is, it doesn't (see to the ending).  But if the film wants to spend so much time in depicting the last days of Hitler in the claustrophobic bunker, well, it is entitled to it, and any (I mean any) people who received decent education already know the pains and deaths Jewish people suffered during the WWII.

The film is always revetting with the convincing atmosphere of the war, and is often terrifying in depicting the atrocious things done during the last days of Hitler, who is clearly losing his mind.  But more horrible thing is many people are faithful to his unreasonable orders, and as Goebbels points out at one scene, no one really forced them to do it.  They are willing to obey, and they actually did.  Perhaps after watching this film, your knowledge about Hitler will not change very much.  But the point is, the film is successful in showing him as he is -- he remains as incredibly contradictory, impossible presence throughout, not as monster, but as human.  And that's why this small man is so frightening.",1123632000,8,3172,4.680505415162455
2151945,5,B0002Z16HY,"I agree with the general gist of most of the other reviewers' comments, so I won't try to repeat what the most insightful of them have to say.

I will say this though:  I don't think at all that the portrayal of the characters is overly sympathetic.  In fact, I think Hitler is portrayed as a tad too deranged.  In the documentary ""The Blind Spot,"" Hitler's secretary spoke of his waxen face towards the end, but I don't recall her referring to his ranting and raving.  That's not to say he didn't do those things, but here it seems as if they're somewhat overdone.  (Overall, though, Ganz's performance as AH is really outstanding, as are the performances of just about everyone else in the film.)

This is a very important film.  I think the Germans and others who made it can be very proud of it, for its basic honesty, its very considerable artistry - and its humanity.",1123632000,5,873,4.481012658227848

Very Scary.

For good or bad, it takes a great actor to bring this off.

I have seen many of Ganz' movies and he deserves more credit as an actor. When an actor makes you forget the actor and think you are truly watching a real historical person, you are witness to great acting.

Guinness and Hopkins are great actors, but could not pull it off like Ganz did.",1123459200,3,492,4.304347826086956
2151947,5,B0002Z16HY,"A powerfully disturbing portrayal of the last days of the 3rd Reich with riveting performances by the entire cast.  Be prepared for an intense, rewarding experience on this one.  From the brief documentary remarks of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge at the outset of the film until the hopeful conclusion, this tour de force will give you plenty to think about long after the final credits fade.  This is one of the best World War II films ever made.

Bruno Ganz gives an award-winning performance.  He's chillingly convincing in his finely nuanced portrayal of Hitler during the last years of his demonic life -- from his amazingly patient, grandfatherly treatment of his secretary to his tyrannical rages with his senior military leaders.  You won't see many performances better than this.

To the credit of the film's director and its casting director, the supporting cast is uniformly strong and gives compelling performances.  One of the most noteworthy supporting performances is the sinister portrayal of Frau Goebbels by Corinna Harfouch.  Magda Goebbels appears throughout most of the film to be an attentive mother (and political enthusiast) who prides herself at molding her 6 children into model National Socialist wunderkinder. In the film's climactic moments Ms. Harfouch convincingly portrays the pathology of Frau Goebbels' excessive glorification of the Fuhrer and his delusional ideology.  Her heinous ""crime"" against nature will shock and outrage many viewers.

Not surprisingly, the sound effects and musical score artfully heighten the emotional intensity of the drama and suspense that unfold on screen.  After the first few opening scenes of the film, which take place outside of Berlin in November 1942, the setting shifts to the bomb-riddled streets of Berlin. The 5.1 surround sound of the incoming artillery shells accentuates not only the sudden location and time change (to April 1945), but even more ominously it then continues a funereal cadence of  pounding artillery explosions during the next 20 or more minutes, signaling the death knell of Hitler's crumbling empire. Make sure to have your subwoofer turned on so you won't miss the audible and palpable reverberations that Surround Sound adds to this well-crafted film.  The musical score also provides an almost haunting backdrop to the malevolence of the Nazi hierarchy, which in the final days of the 3rd Reich cold-bloodedly inflicts a horrific toll on its own German citizens.  These effects clearly signal that film director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a film that is destined to become a classic.

Although the Special Features on the DVD are limited, both are worth watching.  The MAKING OF, while running for 50+ minutes, helps to introduce many of the principal characters of this large cast, as well as provide some interesting behind the scenes comments about the film.  Most of the INTERVIEWS feature repeats parts of the MAKING OF feature.  The ONLY ""new"" (and informative) INTERVIEW was with Melissa Mller, who wrote a book about Hitler's secretary's memoirs.  That interview is well worth watching.

2151950,5,B0002Z16HY,"DER UNTERGANG (DOWNFALL) is not only a brilliant film in its close-up dissection of the mind of a lunatic, it is an important historical document that at last gives us as realistic view as possible of the last days of the Third Reich.  Written by Bernd Eichinger who based his screenplay on memoirs by Traudl Junge  and Melissa Mller ('Bis zur letzten Stunde') and  Joachim Fest, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and acted by an all-German cast, this is about as frightening as a story can get - yet a seemingly authentic one.

Bruno Ganz gives a searingly vivid performance as Hitler, and while some are enraged that the film shows too much of the human side of Hitler (as though this could make him seem less horrid!), Ganz finds that fine line of presenting Hitler as a delusional underachiever who will go to any lengths to fake a 'caring man' to some while always being short-fused into irrational rages to others.  The film takes place in the final 12 days of Hitler's life while he is living in an underground bunker surrounded by many of his fellow ghouls as Russian troops rapidly advance to stamp out his existence.  There is condescension as well as blind devotion among the ranks. Hitler marries Eva Braun, informs his confidants that he will never surrender (nor should they) and then proceeds on his plans to commit suicide with Eva, having extracted a promise that their bodies be burned beyond recognition to prevent desecration by the Allies and encroaching Russians.  How this grand final plan is carried out is terrifying, especially watching Frau Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) sedate then poison all her children, and  quietly placing herself in front of the firing squad.

The spectrum of the horror of Hitler's atrocities is not diminished by this so-called 'humanizing' film:  quite the contrary - Bruno Ganz inhabits the role with a verismo that makes Hitler even more terrifying in being a credible mind gone mad.  The entire cast of this claustrophobic underground bunker team is superb and the direction makes the 156 minutes speed by.  The minimalist musical score by Stephan Zacharias lends just the right tone of eeriness and the cinematography by Rainer Klausmann  (shot in St Petersberg and Munich) is stunning. The film opens and closes with the elderly Traudl Junge (the 'secretary' author of the book on which the film is based) commenting on the terrible tragedy in which she took part.  The effect is devastating.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, August 05",1123200000,4,2492,4.925837320574162
2151951,5,B0002Z16HY,"On the German side w/ Hitler and his SS, this is an impotant WW2 film that in no means should be left out or dismissed.  Every account of the Second Great War should be acknowledged and understood.

  This Film has accomplished and displayed the importance and power of film making by keeping the subject matter and facts true to it's core, While at the same time pulling off what I think is a most spectacular cinamatic achievement.

  Most importantly this film does not justify the terrible acts commited by Hitler and his SS, nor is it in any way inspired through any means of propaganda.  But is rather an attempt at recreating the acounts as they happened during the final days in Berlin.

  Great performances All around, and every aspect has been completed with care.  The only downside I could think of that may dismay certain people is of course the intensity of the film, not  displayed through violence, but though the story and it's subject matter.  Other than that, I can not imagine any other reason not to see this movie.",1123200000,2,1037,4.626373626373627
2151952,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Der Untergang"" (Downfall) is a German production (filmed in Petersberg, Russia ironically enough) that tells the story of the last ten days of Third Reich, told mainly from the perspective of those in the bunker of Adolf Hitler.  But it begins with a scene from 1942 when young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is hired by the Fuehrer as a secretary.  Then we jump ahead to Berlin in 1945, with the Soviet army enclosing the city and Frau Junge still by Hitler's side.  The screenplay by Bernd Eichinger is based on not only Junge's memoir, ""Until the Final Hour"" (written with Melissa Muller), but also Joachim Fest's ""Inside Hitler's Bunker.""  Junge's story was told in a 2002 documentary, ""Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretrin"" (""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary""), which I will be watching next week.  I decided I watched to watch this dramatization first and then watch the documentary.  The real Junge, who died in 2002, appears at the beginning and end of ""Der Untergang,"" providing a context for the story in keep with our perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany from the vantage point of the start of the 21st century.

Basically what we have here with ""Der Untergang"" is a horror movie.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel makes it clear that the machinery of destruction did not stop with the death of Hitler, which is why this 2004 film is about the last ten days of the Third Reich rather than just the last ten days of the life of Adolf Hitler.  In fact the deaths of Hitler and Eva Bruan take place off question with the sound of the bullet that Hitler shot through his brain letting us know the Fuehrer is tote.  Throughout the film Hirschbiegel makes a point of refraining from showing us Nazis shooting themselves, choosing most of the time to show us their corpses (yes, there are some exceptions to this rule, but by the time the camera pans away right before Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) shoots his wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) and then himself, the point has been made.  The voyeuristic emphasis here is not on death but the fact that even with Soviet artillery shelling Berlin and Soviet troops a few hundred meters away, there were so many Nazi officers who were willing to fight to the end or blow their brains out to follow their Fuehrer off to Hell.

Traudl Junge is a spectator to most of what goes on and we know that she is going to survive what is to come just as we know that Hitler will not.  Consequently there are other figures who emerge as being more interesting because we do not know if they are going to get out of Berlin alive.  For me the two key characters because Professor Werner Haase (Matthias Habich), a member of the S.S. who thinks it is long past time that the insanity stopped, and young Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), decorated by Hitler for having destroyed two Soviet tanks with his bazooka and embarrassed by having his father (Karl Kranzkowski) try to drag him off the front line because the war is lost and he wants his son to come out of it alive.  One thing that this movie makes clear is that being a good German (to wit, wanting the nation to survive) has absolutely nothing to do with being a good Nazi (to wit, death before, during or after defeat), but perhaps its greatest strength is in showing the environment that can help us understand (but not accept) why it is nobody ever just pulled out their pistol and blew Hitler's brains out long before he did it himself.

I cannot speak to the authenticity of the events depicted, but they certainly ring true and hold with what historical details I do know about those last days in the Bunker.  Hirschbiegel even adds an additional element of horror to Magda Goebbels's murder of her six children but having one of them fight being administered the sleeping potion that would allow her mother to slip a cyanide capsule into her mouth.  As for Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler, what I think I got out of watching the film is that Hitler was nice to women and that they worshipped him, some, such as Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), more than others.  But whether it was simply ingrained manners or a measured response to deep adoration, it is hard to tell.  Not that it matters much in the end, because even if Hitler can be seen as being human that does not make him any less of a monster.

In fact, it can serve to magnify the horror.  When Hitler marries Ava Braun the presiding official is required by the Race Laws of Nazi Germany to ask the Fuehrer and his bride if they are of pure Aryan origins.  Given that the Nazi ideal is a tall, clean shaven, curly haired blond Bavarian and Hitler is a short man with a dishevelled mop of dark hair and a Charlie Chaplin mustache who came from Austria, it seems obvious to me that Hitler is one of the least Aryan looking Nazis.  But you do get a sense of Hitler's charisma and the power he holds over these others is clearly absolute.  Even as Berlin is crumbling the Nazi's struggle to order remains paramount, and if there is any clear contrast between Nazi Germany and modern America it is that the government can make all the calls for order that it wants, but we are not willing to simply shut up and go along like sheep to the slaughter.",1123113600,4,5205,4.535256410256411

This is the story of a young girl that happens to apply for the wrong job at the wrong time. Throughout her career as Hitler's secretary she is privy to many historical figures of the Third Reich. The movie includes many side stories that help explain the chaos that was the last days and the insanity. Main focus is given to the last month of the regime and what went on in and around the bunker. If you want to see the most realistic movie concerning the last days of Hitlerism, this is the one. I applaud the courage of the German film company that chose to take on a story about the worst time in their nation's history. Also, the extra features are awesome!",1123113600,2,846,4.190184049079755
2151964,5,B0002Z16HY,"""April 1945, a nation awaits its...Downfall"" so goes the tagline for this movie. That should pretty much tell you all you need to know about the content of this film. Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall"" depicts the last 12 days before the end of WW2. The Russians are fighting their way through Berlin as the Third Reich must now face their defeat.

 Many people have damned the movie saying the film wrongly humanizes Hitler and the Nazis. These kind of statements are misleading. Yes perhaps some are right, the movie does present Hitler as a human being, we are after all seeing the movie through his eyes. He is the star of the film but under no circumstances does the movie advocate his actions. In my opinion by presenting Hitler the way the film does it merely shows what sort of madman he was. He was a lunatic. Here was a man who failed at nearly ever endeavor he pursued. ""Downfall"" paints Hitler as a man filled with delusions. He insist that his army continues fighting while others around him say it is pointless. Many of his closet allies abandon him while he goes on protesting saying Germany can not make the same mistake it did during WW1 and surrender. Hitler even says he allowed the Russians to advance as far as they did. It is all a ploy. Now either Hitler was starting to lose his mind or he really did feel he could have won.

 ""Downfall"" on a purely emotion level reminds me of Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" both films seem gut wrenchingly real. It should be pointed out this movie is based on two books. One of them written by Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge entitled ""Until the Final Hour"" and another book entitled ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest. Because of this we believe most of what we see as real. We imagine this was probably the way it really happened. And when you look at the film from that viewpoint you may find, as I did, the movie is depressing. We see people committ suicide and kill their each other, husbands, wives, even children all before they are caught. The scenes with the children broke my heart. Make no mistake about it ""Downfall"" is a brutally violent film that the squeamish should not see.

 But despite the depressing tone and violence ""Downfall"" is a movie that needs to be seen by as many people who think they can stomach because if for any reason it will serve as a constant reminder of the horrors which were committed and how future generations must learn about the past so incidents such as these will never be repeated.

 And what about Bruno Ganz performance? He is surely a front runner for an Oscar nomination. For people who condemn the movie for its portrayal of Hitler, you must realize the complexity of his performance. It is harder to present Hitler this way then in the fashion most wanted. For that you have to give Ganz his due credit.

 Bottom-line: At times an all too powerful film depicting the final days of Adolf Hitler. Brutally violent and even depressing this is still a must see so it will serve as a constant reminder of what these people did.",1123027200,10,3042,4.565137614678899

This movie will be compared with the two earlier efforts made in the English language and needless to say, Downfall surpassed both of these films quite easily.

The movie in parts, is seen through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary. Its through her perception that we get a balanced view of Adolf Hitler who borderline as psychopathic manaic as the Fuhrer of the Third Reich and a more human Hitler when viewed in a private setting. Hitler, played fantastically well by Bruno Ganz remained the core of the movie as the sun from which all planets evolved around. Ganz captured Hitler perfectly, showing all elements of Hitler's personality with a fine touch of balance. This was something Alec Guiness and Anthony Hopkins were unable to do in their effort. Ganz was well supported by his supporting players, I was specially impressed with Corinna Harfoual who played Madga Goebbel and the scene where she murdered her children proves to be quite disturbing as well as chilling.

I think the only real weakness of the movie comes in the introduction of some of the characters. For many who are not strong in history of the Third Reich, many of the characters and their functions will appears to be confusing and mysterious. The movie doesn't do a very good job in introduction of host of characters.

The DVD edition of this film proves to be pretty well put together. I owned a regular 45 inch projection TV and the images looked quite good. The German language 5.1 proves to be quite active and the English subtitles proves to be easy to read and understand. There are two special features item. One is the ""Making of Downfall"" feature and other is individual interviews with some of the actors.

2151983,4,B0002Z16HY,"This, apparently, is one of the first German films to deal with Hitler up-close.  I saw it in the cinema, in German, with subtitles.  The film is told through the eyes of one of Hitler's young secretaries, who remains loyal to him as the regime disintegrates and Hitler's senior henchmen desert him.  The film disturbed me in that I felt some admiration for those who stayed loyal, even though it is quite clear in the dialogue that Hitler and his clique were cruel beyond belief.  The atmosphere in the bunker is increasingly doom-laden, occasionally lightened by the apparently brainless antics of Eva Braun and the descent into alcoholic stupor of some of Hitler's praetorian guard.

 The actor who plays Hitler is mesmeric, flying into uncontrollable rages and torrents of German invective; it was a thoroughly convincing, and alienating, performance.  Eva Braun's character is also well played, the light-weight is in denial of what is to come, but nevertheless knows that the end in near. The Goebbel's (husband and wife) are too shallow for me, however the wife convincingly  plays the most horrific sequence I have ever seen on screen [ you will know it when you have seen the movie].  In all there is a convincing level of accuracy about the movie - it becomes obvious that all the scenes could have been observed by someone who survives the bunker.

 At the end of the film I was left with the clear impression of what a crazed individual Hitler was, however I was completely perplexed as to why the German people followed Hitler and his cronies, especially when the Russian offensive turned into a retreat, from 1943 onwards.  There is an acute illustration of the sufferings of the Germans in the late stages of the war.  The last section of the film contains documentary footage of Hitler's secretary from 2002, when as an old lady she gave a half-hearted recognition of the part she played in the genocide that the Hitler regime unleashed.  I found her words very grudging and blinkered and I think this was a good addition to the film; because even the most innocent and ignorant of this clique participated, even in small ways,  in the a series of monstrous crimes through the period of the Nazi rule of Germany and Europe. In the end they are all shamed, those who were loyal to Hitler and those who deserted him.",1120089600,9,2330,4.746898263027295

There was a saying that if you were to kill a person, you were called a murderer.  If you were to kill hundreds of people, you were called a tyrant.  If you were to kill thousands of people, you were called a conqueror.  And if you were to kill millions of people, you were called a Leader.  Here, you were able to see that in some people's point of view, Hitler was the saviour for Germania and their devotion and loyalty towards the man were unwavering till his death with his Mistress.  For the Jews, he was a monster who would zealously wiped out one race for the sake of maintaining the purity of the Aryan people.  For some, they finally understood that Hitler was an intolerant person that wouldn't take compromises and would take extreme measures to get his way.  They simply repented and subsequently went against his wills.  Here again, we question the rationality of having a war.  It's simply senseless to see a German killing another German whilst other Germans were fighting the onslaught of the Red Russia Army and having to protect the deprived, forgotten, and ""dispensable"" civilians.  Audience shook their heads in disbelief as Dr Goebbels (one of Hitler's more prominent cronies) and his wife calmly fed their children with cynides prior to them meeting their own deaths.  For them, it's about unquestionable loyalty and fanaticism towards one particular belief such as what Talibans and Al Qaedas believe in jihad to free Middle East from white's supremacy.  Lastly, there were those unspoken heroes that would stand up to the occasions to fend for the weaks when they weren't able to defend for themselves.  There were also those whose innocence was lost and that reality didn't seem to live up to their expectations.  ""Downfall"" is very good in terms of depicting the daily happenings, the intimate moment such as Hitler struggling with his Parkinson disease, reactions of various people from different facets of society, people dealing with their own mortality through denial, coming to term with it, or simply quickening the process to their final moment.  This is truly a riveting movie told from German's perspective catering for the matured audience that would want to understand people's reactions to it all rather than having those glorifying images shoved down our throats as done by other American film-makers.  A movie that would linger on in my memory bank for many years to come and a movie that deserved to be watched on the big screen.  Highly recommended.",1119225600,6,2712,4.923076923076923
2151986,5,B0002Z16HY,"Rarely has any movie dealt with the depths of human emotion and behaviour in a period of history that still affects many people six decades after the collapse of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany than this offering from a German director, Oliver Hirschbiegel, and a German screenplay writer, Bernd Eichinger, soberly entitled ""Der Untergang"" (""Downfall""), dealing with a dictatorship that a lot of people in Germany still find painful even to mention. The movie is based partly on two works, one a widely-acclaimed treatise by a professional historian, Joachim Fest, an acknowledged expert on the life of Adolf Hitler, and the other an autobiographical work by the woman, from whose perspective this movie is largely told, the late Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary from November 1942 until his death on the last day of April 1945.

This movie tells it like it is, without any background to the events about to unfold on screen, yet bookended by footage of Junge herself, speaking on camera (shortly before her death at the age of 81) in a documentary made in 2002, where she tells of her struggle to come to terms with her feelings on having been the employee of one of the greatest criminals in the history of the world, one who had ordered the extermination of at least six million Jews in the concentration camps (mentioned in the closing credits of the movie lest anyone forget what he was partly responsible for).

The then-Miss Humps, aged only 22, came to work for Hitler in November 1942, which is actually when the film opens. Five young would-be personal secretaries come to the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia amid secrecy and introduce themselves to the Fuehrer, played with astonishing sobriety by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. One might have expected a powerful entrance from the Hitler character, yet Ganz immediately delivers his lines quietly and in a manner suggesting that they had all met before, thus putting the nervous ladies at their ease. Hitler is immediately interested upon hearing that Traudl (Alexandra Maria Lara) comes from Munich, a place that he held in special affection, since it had been there that he had led the attempted but failed Putsch (coup d'etat) to overthrow the then-government of the Weimar Republic back in 1923, yet nothing regarding this fact is actually stated or implied in his decision to employ her, even if she actually makes a complete hash of her first attempt at dictation from the Fhrer.

The scene shifts to what would become the menu for the rest of the film - complete and utter chaos as Berlin is shelled by Soviet artillery, resulting in communication breakdowns, whether implied or actual, panic amongst civilians, misplaced loyalty by both top Nazis like Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) - who have their own plans for the future of the Reich - and those caught up in the madness of the Volkssturm (the Nazi equivalent of the Home Guard in Britain) pretending to be anywhere near ready to resist the might of the Soviet army. The scene where an armless Wilhelm Kranz (Karl Kranzkowski), the father of Hitler Youth member Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), a 12-year old who would be decorated by Hitler himself for bravery, confronts a group of Hitler Youth members is incredibly poignant, as he berates them for being so utterly naive and stupid for getting themselves in this situation. The sight of a young girl, Inge Dombrowski (Yelena Zelenskaya), wearing a German army helmet on top of her plaited hair and reaffirming her loyalty to the Fhrer immediately reveals a picture of utter incongruity and lost innocence and childhood, thus showing how desperate the situation had become for Berliners. Kranz, not surprisingly, accuses his father of being a coward, but, rather oddly, himself runs off, if only to join other members in the grounds of the Reich Chancellery to receive his decoration from an utterly haggard and low-voiced Fhrer, his (barely concealed) left hand shaking as a result of what was thought to be Parkinson's disease. ""If only my generals had your courage,"" Hitler says to Kranz, although the remark is clearly lost on the 12-year-old, as he listens to him say that he and his fellows will be the true heroes of ""Germania"" (his planned renaming of Berlin, as seen in the huge model when he talks with Albert Speer, his armaments minister) when it rises from the ashes. However, these scenes of lost innocence and childhood are eclipsed by the later one of Magda Goebbels (Juliane Khler), wife of the German Propaganda Minister, giving no second thought to poisoning her six young children as they sleep in their bunks.

One gets perspectives of the action, not just from Junge and Kranz (who inexplicably meet up at the end of the movie when the Soviet soldiers move in), but also from others such as Prof. Dr. Ernst-Gnther Schenck (Christian Berkel), who, though wearing an S.S. colonel's uniform, remains true to his profession as a doctor and is genuinely concerned for the welfare of the civilians and the wounded soldiers, who would be left behind in Operation ""Clausewitz"" when the able-bodied soldiers begin their operation to withdraw. Schenck is one of few high-ranking officers who dares question the absurdity of the actions going on around him yet the nearest he gets to challenging authority is when he tells S.S.-Obergruppenfhrer Tellermann (Veit Stbner) that he should be allowed to remain in Berlin, a ""request"" that the general grants. The scenes of amputations of limbs without anaesthetic carried out in a makeshift hospital by Prof. Dr. Werner Haase (Matthias Habich of ""Enemy at the Gates"" fame) with a saw can seem utterly harrowing for the squeamish.

Most of the action, though, takes place deep in the Fhrerbunker, where conflicting and absurd emotions and behaviours are in evidence: the drunkenness of soldiers who appear to be able to down as much alcohol as they want and get away with it, the incredulity of Speer (Heino Ferch of ""Run Lola Run"" fame) at Hitler's decision to sentence the German people to death (in effect) via his scorched-earth policy (which he thankfully had no intention of complying with) and at the absurdity of Magda Goebbels declaring that nothing is worth living for without National Socialism, as well as the apparent boisterousness of Hitler's then-fiancee, Eva Braun (Corinna Harfouch), at an impromptu party where she dresses up and makes merry, which causes Junge to realize that it is like being trapped in a nightmare.

Predictably, given the subject-matter of the movie, the rantings and ravings of Adolf Hitler himself (""No capitulation!"") become centre stage at various points, as he denounces so-called ""loyal"" officers as drug addicts, sycophants and traitors as well as lambasts the generals for their failure to obey his orders or do anything right: ""You call yourself generals because you went to military academies and learned how to use a knife and fork! I didn't go, but I conquered Europe all by myself!"" On the other hand, he could rely on S.S.-Brigadefhrer Wilhelm Mohnke (Andre Hennicke) to carry out his orders to defend Berlin to the last man, only he never got that far.

Recriminations galore fly about amongst the army and S.S. generals, questioning their situation, Hitler's lack of sanity and proper leadership, their own attitudes and loyalties, yet all of these tension-filled arguments point to an inevitable collapse of a system, which had seemed invincible years before but was now disintegrating fast as the Russians were approaching. The sight of generals shooting themselves in the head at the news of the impending surrender only adds to the idea that Hitler had held everything together and that they seemed utterly helpless and lost without him. Others like Traudl, deeply affected at the time by the suicide of her employer, Peter Kranz and Dr. Schenck, however, are left with the shattered remnants of a battered and defeated Reich and could only wonder what their futures would be. The movie ends with a ""Who's Who"" gallery of the protagonists, stating their eventual fate (with the odd exception of Peter Kranz, seen on a bicycle with Traudl in the last scene), framed by sorrowful orchestral music written by Stephan Zacharias.

This movie, which richly deserved its Academy Award nomination for Best Picture in a Foreign Language for 2004, pulls no punches and neither glorifies nor condemns - yet, even though the Third Reich passed into history in May 1945, one gets the feeling that one can never escape from its legacy, even those born years after Berlin fell. The final surprises about the movie itself, however, come in the closing credits when one realizes, firstly, that external scenes were made in St. Petersburg, Russia, a city which, as Leningrad, the German army besieged for more than two years during the same war. Secondly, so many of the German-speaking actors are Russian, not German (like the one who played Inge). It is therefore a monumental testament to reconciliation between Russia and Germany that actors and behind-the-scenes talents from both countries came together and co-operated to make a film about the downfall of one of the most hideous regimes in history, one from which Russia suffered greatly, as did other nations.",1119139200,7,9230,4.992852501624432
2151987,5,B0002Z16HY,"This is an astounding, incredible film in almost every aspect.  First, Bruno Ganz does an incredible job of playing Hitler.  As many reviewers mentioned, he deserved an Oscar far more than most actors who have EVER received it.  Why?  Because the actor (and the director) had to balance the film and the portrayal of the twentieth century's most horrible figure in a way that was not too caracturistic (as is the norm) nor too ""human"" and apologetic.  Ganz clearly portrays the swings between resigned lucidity and enraged insanity.  I am also to understand (though unable to be sure myself) that Ganz uses the same Austrian accent that Hitler had when he was not giving public addresses.

Second, this film depicts the Battle of Berlin - the Last Battle as Cornelius Ryan called; and a batttle little known among the West (as it was a Russian vs. German battle).  But it was in many ways an incredible, but predictable battle.  Soviet casualties were enormous on their relentlous drive on Berlin from the Vistula River; similarly, German losses were devastating under the massive weight of the Soviet juggernaut.  Indeed, Berlin stands as one of the examples, along with Stalingrad and other cities, of urban warfare at its worst.

Third, I believe this film accomplishes the amazing task of somewhat ""rooting for"" - or at least sympathizing with the Germans.  Of course they were the bad guys and had done horrible things, but one might feel sorry for the Volksturm being gunned down, the victims of the execution squads, the generals both under fire and abused by Hitler, and indeed most of the people stuck in Hitler's bunker.  In this way it is similar to Das Boot; one sees that the Germans were also victims of their own war, however much they were the cause of it.  One can find oneself hoping that everyone will live to see the long peace of Europe, rather than kill themselves in defeatism.

I agree that the lack of identifying people is confusing - the uniforms are similar, and even I who know both uniforms and personalities was challenged from time to time.  However, the Director probably wanted to avoid the viewer from focusing attention away from Hitler; and it is true that everyone else is a supporting actor in his personal road to suicide.

My main criticisms are that there were criticims of the film (such as it not focusing on the Holocaust); and its poor recognition by the Academy.  As far as minor criticisms, for those who do not know the history very well they may have trouble appreciating the situation, the politics, and the people.  Also, I thought the actors and actresses looked in rather good form (for example Keitel looks like he's in his mid-40s and fresh from a vacation); the reality is these people had been worn down and battered by six years of war and Hitler's personality.",1118880000,4,2820,4.765432098765432
2151988,5,B0002Z16HY,"There are not many instances where I ""want"" to see a movie which is spoken in a foreign language with English subtitles.  However, I heard of this film when it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars and decided I HAD to see it.  I am an avid WWII buff, and especially things related to Nazi Germany and Europe, so it was a must for me to see this film.  And let me tell you....the subtitles really made no difference, because from start to finish, this masterpiece speaks without a word being uttered....

Bruno Ganz does an EXCELLENT job of playing the role of Hitler.  When he first appears, I actually had a chill go down my back because of how ""real"" to Hitler Ganz looked.  He looked and sounded exactly how I have imagined Hitler would have been in person during those last days.  It was actually quite scary, and made the whole feel of the film that much more intense.

Elsewhere, all of the actors and actresses played their parts exquisitely.  You really had sympathy for the man and his family that were killed when he ignited the explosive at the dinner table.  Eva Braun was portrayed as a blooming idiot who only wanted to dance the night away (which probably wasn't far from the truth!), and you could feel the coldness of Magda Goebbels as she killed her children with cyanide rather than have them live in a world without National Socialism.  One of the most riveting scenes in the film was when Josef Goebbels is standing in front of the funeral pyre.  What an amazing, and extremely haunting!, scene!

This film was an excellent rendition of what it must have been like during those last days of the fallen Third Reich.  It gives us a very real portrait of the last days of one the 20th Century's most evil, and most influential, societies.  This movie most certainly deserved the Oscar over the film that did win it, but I believe the subject matter is what ultimately kept it from receiving the award it deserved.

The key is that it is very psychological and character grounded, which gives you a look inside the bunker as the days numbered to a close. The film's controversy is obviously bunk. Does the film portray Hitler as kind & loving to his subordinates and dog, Blondi? Of course. He was human. Mad indeed, but in portraying him as ""a master of all evil"" we turn him into a one-dimensional character and lose sight of the true horror that humanity is capable of. From what I have read, the film remains very faithful to the historical accounts of what was happening those final days. I also think the film had a very good positive message spoken in the end by the real Traudl Junge, herself. While the story begins with her curiousity and blindness to serve her leader, ultimately she realizes that her youth and ignorance was no excuse. All of the information was available to her and she chose to turn a blind eye to it all. This says a lot about the America we are living in today.",1117756800,7,1060,4.413265306122449

2152004,5,B0002Z16HY,"""Downfall"" is one of the most astonishing movies I have seen this year.  I am a little baffled that it hasn't received more attention in the United States.  Bruno Ganz should have gotten an Oscar nomination for best actor. But it did get a nomination for best foreign film.  ""Downfall"" is easily as good and gripping as the renowned hit ""Das Boot"".  It's probably the case that foreign movies don't get as much attention now as they did in the 1980's.  Nevertheless, this fine film should have a long life on DVD.

""Downfall"" has caused some controversy because it depicts Adolf Hitler not as a demon, but as a human being who was kind to his young secretaries and his dogs.  In fact this makes his evil all the more insidious and monstrous.  ""Downfall"" can be seen as an attempt by Germans to come to terms with their part in Hitler's crimes.  How could a not-entirely-bad man like Albert Speer or an innocent like Traudl Junge retain their loyalty and admiration for such a diseased figure?  We see the terrible events of April 1945 through German eyes.  This involves acknowledging the horrible suffering of the German people as they were bombed and smashed into surrender.  (Definitely, however, without letting them off the hook for their moral responsibility for the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity.)

We see Berlin turned into an apocalyptic landscape that would not seem out of place in the Book of Revelation.  Gangs of murdering Nazis roam the rubble, looking for final victims to lynch.  The Volkssturm, the army of old men and little boys recruited for the last defense of the city, is slaughtered by the advancing Russians.  Officials of the regime are committing suicide right and left.  (Some historians say there were more suicides among the Germans during the end than among the Japanese.) Down in the fuehrer's bunker Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge (the wide-eyed, pretty, sweet Alexandra Maria Lara) witnesses the death throes of the Reich.  Bruno Ganz is amazing as Hitler.  The warm, human angel of ""Wings of Desire"" is entirely gone, replaced by this occasionally lucid, frequently rabid being.  For long stretches of the movie, I swear, I entirely forgot there was an actor working up on the screen and it seemed as if I was watching Hitler himself in all his malignancy.

The movie turns the screws of suspense as things get worse and worse, and you get a solemn sense of justice being done at last.  (Although there are still crimes that can be committed, like the diabolical murder of Goebbels' small children by their mother, shown in graphic detail.)  The key to the movie perhaps can be had in a little speech by Goebbels.  An army General protests the wanton slaughter of civilians and the Volkssturm.  Goebbels replies, ""I have no sympathy.  No sympathy!  The German people gave us the mandate.  And now you cry because your little throats are being cut.""  It's a chilling moment.  And a sobering reminder that politicians must be held accountable, and the people of a nation have to be responsible in their choice of leaders.",1115683200,382,3076,4.826003824091778

2152006,5,B0002Z16HY,"I found ""Downfall"" as both a very troubling yet very satisfying film.  Troubling in so far as the events of the final collapse of Berlin were simply so awful; satisfying in that the depiction of events seemed plausible without ever glorifying war.

Let there be no doubt that Adolf Hitler was one of history's greatest monsters.  He catapulted Germany and much of Europe back into the middle ages as he pursued his warped ambitions.  However, it must be said that Hitler was a real person in that he had many emotions common with all people.  ""Downfall"" shows some of these emotions although it never seeks to excuse Hitler and his barbarous henchmen.

In many ways, the end of the First World War was ambiguous.  Yes, Germany lost but it was never totally smashed.  An armistice was signed and reparations ultimately crippled the German economy but the country was never totally beaten.  Hitler played on this fact and the emotions it brought out in the German people.  He was a master manipulator.  The inevitable end product proved to be total annihilation of the Third Reich as Hitler cowered in his bunker.  The Red Army was literally only a few hundred metres away before he ended his life.

Bruno Granz portrayal of Hitler is phenomenal.  Here we see all the madness and paranoia brought to the screen in vivid detail.  Granz is worthy of an Academy Award.  But along with Hitler comes all his loopy followers.  None of these is more chilling than Goebbels and his fanatic wife.  Evil is truly at work in these two.

But Adolph Hitler, brilliantly potrayed by Bruno Ganz, is charming and this is the first film, as far as I know, in which he is humanized.  This is important because Americans (and the rest of the world) have been, will be and are duped by such politicians all the time.

Perhaps the most duped of all are the ideologues themselves(in this case Hitler).  Almost until the end he could not accept that objective reality belied the world of his wishes and fantasies?  Have we not recently seen ideologues who carry out their program in spite of scientific cries against their environmental policy and world leaders against their barbarous imperialism?

And what of the film clip of Hitler's secretary at the end, in which she claims that she knew little of the pogroms being carried out?  How much do we Americans know about how our money is used to carry out heinous acts abroad?

We are not to be so complacent and think of the cruelty ofthis epoch as an exception.  It is in fact commonplace.",1113523200,10,1197,4.6084905660377355
2152008,5,B0002Z16HY,"I had the chance to see (April 2nd, 2005) the movie The Downfall (Der Untergang) which has circulated very discreetly on screens in the USA. Here in Florida - where I live - they only exhibit it in one out-of-the-way cinema house (the Jewish community here is huge). It truly seems to me an IMPORTANT document which should be seen in the history classes of all the schools in the world so that never again are repeated the lies of the most depraved people, like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Kim Il Sung, Mao, Ceausescu, Idi Amin, Pinochet, Fidel Castro, Milosevic or Hugo Chavez, to mention only a few. Apart from the feelings which this movie can provoke in anyone, I really think it is an extremely important document for the advancement and maturity of German society in confronting -with what dignity such an atrocity and memory could permit them- their search through false ideals of superiority and glory the ERRORS of subjecting entire peoples for whatever reasons there may have been (there will always be a reason) and arguing through a nationalism of props the lowest ambitions and ruination of beings devoid of God and humanity.

2152009,5,B0002Z16HY,"I saw this film in Germany in November, 2004, and picked up a copy in Berlin this March...my pre-ordered Amazon.de copy was waiting for me on my return.

This film is essential for anyone who wishes to understand ""the evil that men do"" (and women, for example, Frau Goebbels, who killed her children because she did not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism, Nazism).  It is a deep film, based on the historical novel of Joachim Fest, and the stunning documentary ""Blind Spot"" (Bis Zum Toten Winkel) revealing the thoughts of Hitler's personal secretary, Traudl Humps (married to an SS officer on Hitler's staff who was killed in 1943, she became Traudl Jung), shortly before her death as the millenium turned.

The acting is superb.  The best new crop of German actors, as well as Bruno Ganz portraying Der Fhrer himself, are excellent.  Most of the elements that led to the coming of the Holocaust, the Third Reich, and its downfall are cleverly intertwined in this phenomenally staged docudrama.  In several viewings, I could find virtually nothing to criticize, down to the china used in the bunker, or so-called Fhrerbunker, to the attitudes of the many Field Marshalls, who were in many ways as ""apolitical"" as General Tommy Franks, attitudes of resignation, as suicide as the last honorable gesture, of ""doing the right thing.""

Such films have to be seen in context.  After 60 years of banishment of the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German) in Germany, we see the swastika in its full ""glory"" throughout the film, the beautiful and attractive uniforms originally designed by Hugo Boss (no kidding).  In context, in 2004, Germans were suddenly faced with an extremely well-made film that shows Hitler as nearly human (hiding is Parkinsonian tremor of his left hand behind his back as he presents the Iron Cross, 2nd Class, to Hitler Youth defending Berlin after the declaration of ""Clausewitz""--Berlin as a war front.  While other officers plead for the evacuation of women and children, Hitler responds that the German people (das Volk) do not deserve to survive, because they have lost this war.  National Socialism is revealed as the death culture it was.  In other contexts, there are excellend books, articles, and documentaries revealing how willing the German Volk were to turn over all thought, conscience, morality, to the Fhrer, who encouraged them to do so.  Unfortunately, the next 60 years would show that the attitudes of National Socialism did not die with him.

I could individually commend the performances of the many players and people behind the scenes.  I have been to Berlin, and this IS Berlin, to any approximation I have seen in photos of the time, and I have been in the last remaining Air Raid shelter (bunker) for the populace and it is no different from this soundstage, save the furniture that was probably taken from Jews years before by the party, which ended up as furnishings in the many homes of the high command and Hitler.

After viewing the film, I do recommend that the viewer take in ""Schindler's List"" or ""The Pianist"" to complement it.  As we are faced with worldwide conflagration against a non-uniformed enemy of Western culture and democracy, it is hard to think of World War Two as the last of the ""civilized"" wars, even though it was perhaps the last of uniformed armies facing one another (the Cold War, which never went hot, excluded).

This film does show, through the characters of Traudl Junge and her young friend, the Hitler Youth decorated by Hitler personally, as they walk through the Soviet line on their way back to Bavaria, that the policy of war as a solution to any international dispute is at best fragile.  Perhaps that fragility is our best hope for peace.",1111708800,419,3744,4.867716535433071

2152011,5,B0002Z16HY,"Downfall is quite possibly the best war movie ever made. Showing all aspects of German society from Hitler and his high command to the elderly to little kids and how they are reacting to the inevitable defeat. This film strikes at the heart as it portrays a society on the brink of total collapse. Combining brilliant performances with a very well chosen (and accurate looking) cast, and unbelievably realistic sets, Downfall delivers the fury and frustration of the last days of The Third Reich with realism and drama as no other film has done before. Realistic in all aspects and often recreating Deutsche WochenSchau (German Newsreels) to near perfection this movie is not going to disappoint even the sticklers for realism. This is certainly a must see film and while it is certainly not sympathetic to national socialism it provides a rarely seen view of the suffering and trauma that the German people faced under the final days of Hitler's regime.

With dark, yet rich cinematography and a soundtrack that includes constant shelling and gunfire the viewer of this film is quickly immersed in the horror and desperation of a losing battle. While the film's initial scene is in 1942 at the Wolfchanse (Hitler's East Prussian command center) where Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary, is interviewed and chosen the rest of the film takes place in and around the Reich Chancelory's main bunker. Fast forwarding to April 20th 1945, Hitler's 56th Birthday the viewer sees a reich in near ruin and a high command who realizes the end is near but is divided in several different camps on how the downfall should occur.

Bruno Ganz playing Adolf Hitler in his final days does an amazing performance. Hunched over, with a nearly uncontrollable left hand, Ganz plays a Hitler with radical mood swings so brilliantly. The supporting cast is equally brilliant and the girl who plays Traudl Junge, from whose eyes the film is portrayed, is very effective and the viewer cant help but harbor some sympathy for her. Among the other roles worthy of mention include Joseph and Magda Goebbels. These two characters are played like the sociopaths that they really were. While I feel that the scene and build up to the murder of there own children was gratuitous they were certainly well played. Also worthy was the role of Albert Speer, he was played remarkably well and we cant help but think of his final defiance at least somewhat heroic.

The film attempts to be as objective as possible and rather than glorifying the Third Reich in any way as it constantly shows the futility of the war. It shows how the total war scenario was despised even by many of Hitler's top Generals. Brutally showing how so many leaders and officers took the coward's way out the film shows very graphically the horrors of war as also shows the death of families widespread suffering and the needless victims of Hitler's Reich.

I recommend this film to all: it portrays the culmination of the biggest event in the 20th century objectively and seriously. It shows that certainly not all Germans during WWII were horrible people, while a few were to the final moment. It is brilliantly made and will put a knot in your stomach from start to end. I cant speak highly enough about this film. While you may be speechless for 10 minutes following the first view it will stick with you and be something often thought about. As twilight finally falls on the tragic history of WWII we should be thankful that such a film is made to help us remember and hold on to our humanity.

8035056,5,B0002Z16HY,"Movie: Incredible movie, acting, sets, texture and writing.  Bruno Ganz and the rest of the cast brought home phenomenal performances of such iconic and infamous characters. My wife and I have seen it enough times we pay far less attention to the subtitles and more on the acting and story.

Blu-ray: I own Downfall on regular DVD, having watched it over and over, i wasn't sure i wanted to spring for another copy, but in Blu-ray; so happy i did.  The clarity, colors and sound are far better than my original DVD, perhaps not quite 'remastered' quality; but certainly worth the upgrade.",1525046400,,588,4.745098039215686
