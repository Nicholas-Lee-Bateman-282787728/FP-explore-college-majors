5178260,2,B008PDAF7C,"Having watched the series on TV, I bought the DVDs only to find that the subtitles for the hard of hearing was not included. I kept the DVDs as I enjoyed the story by watching and remembering the gist of the words. It is most frustrating to realise that hard of hearing people are unable to enjoy so many films when adding subtitles to them is technically simple. Buyers beware! Check before you buy to avoid disappointment. If a subtitled version did come onto the market I would gladly purchase it and give the non subtitled version to some needy hearing person!",1362614400,6,564,4.53921568627451
5178261,5,B008PDAF7C,"Good Family Stories.  Lots of ""Real Life Lessons""  Miss a lot of the words though. Could use English Subtitles.  But acting is so down to earth that can usually figure out what is going on.",1352678400,5,189,4.3428571428571425

8529499,5,B008PDAF7C,"We had seen My Uncle Silas years ago on public television and loved it! We have waited many long years to add this delightful series to our personal collection. Whether playing the randy rascal Silas, or the complex genius Winston Churchill in The Gathering Storm, Albert Finney is incredible.",1449014400,,293,5.0
8529500,5,B008PDAF7C,"Wonderful. Pre war British country-side stories. Slightly raunchy, but only if you understand the references. Great family entertainment. DVD's came as described. Good value.",1445990400,,174,6.291666666666667

8529503,3,B008PDAF7C,"Yes, the series is charming, but it's not really family fare.  The stories are mostly about drinking and sex.  Yes, coyly and delightfully presented, with the sex merely implied and alluded to in ways guaranteed to go over the kiddies' heads, but so much story time is devoted to dalliance and Uncle Silas's ""cute"" drinking  I suspect most children will just be bored.  The little boy character is only peripheral.  This is not a collection of little boy adventures.  It's not even really about the relationship between Silas and little Edward, his great-nephew.  Edward is there mainly to look puzzled or politely resigned, and to ask predictable cute/awkward questions at just the wrong moment for everyone's entertainment.  It is, however, a marvelous showcase for Albert Finney, who is great fun to watch.",1432857600,,809,5.075757575757576

8529506,5,B008PDAF7C,"I purchased the DVD collection to replace my old videotape version.  The price was very good.

Below is a comment I made on another purchaser's review.  He had found much of the subject matter offensive.  I read a lot of Bates' writings and have always enjoyed them.

The character of Uncle Silas was based on H. E. Bates' Uncle Joe and the 1939 book (and much later TV series) was based on Bates' recollection of time spent in 1915 as a ten year old boy with his 60 year old Uncle Joe. It's entirely possible that country life was earthier in those days. Bates' short stories are known for their rich character development. The broadcast series is delightful.",1367193600,4,660,4.559322033898305
