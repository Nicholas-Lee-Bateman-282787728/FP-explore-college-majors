8249263,3,B001360UXM,"This set includes the 1972 italian series that was produced by the great
italian director dario argento. Who also directs two episodes.  This set was going to be released in our region (region one the u.s. and canada)  by no shame films but it never came out because no shame no longer exists.  So if you want to see this 4 episode tv series you have to buy this pal version. BUT If you don't have a all region tv then you can't play it on your tv.  Dragon video a german
company that  put this out in limited numbers. The picture quality is not too bad but there is a badground degregation in sound. in other words a rubbing type noise.  It's not that distracting though.  The episodes are
murder mysteries pretty much with the violence not shown unlike a typical feature movie of that period.  The stories are all good but this is only for argento completists I would say for two reasons: the high cost of this dvd set and the lack of remastering that film this age needs.  If no shame had survived we'd have had this set for about 24.00 and it would have been well worth it for those who like tv murder mysteries. A exxa,ple of this is  The first
episode in which a young couple try to escape their murderous neighbor has plenty of suspense but fan's of italian horror should note that this is a tv show and so it's not a gore fest or slasher flick.  So I would say until this comes out in the united states that this set is for only argento completists.",1221004800,,1457,4.242753623188406
