8318350,5,B001LKK6WA,"Very challenging but I think she is an excellent teacher and easy to follow.  I don't recommend for absolute beginners. You need a foundation on the basics of belly dance before this video if you want to learn her technique...Absolutely worth your money and time if you are wanting to change up your performance. To my surprise, she teaches floating technique and moon walking with layering.  Non stop drilling.  I think the choreography is awesome.  Something different from what I'm use to.",1476748800,,492,4.963414634146342
8318351,5,B001LKK6WA,"This is a great technique DVD, it's not a weight loss or beginners DVD. It has some cute combos, and a pretty good warm up and conditioning section as well as fantastic breakdowns of the moves. This wouldn't be great for a really new dancer, but someone with some past experience/instruction would do great. I love the camel moonwalk.",1408579200,,334,4.677966101694915

but still with clear, patient explanations.
i consider myself an advanced beginner and the dvd is definitely improving my dance and improvisation.
highly recommended, you won't be sorry if you want to learn this style of belly dance.",1406160000,,304,4.865384615384615
8318353,4,B001LKK6WA,"This DVD is very very specific and exactly what it says in the title: ""Pop & Lock Tribal Fusion Hip-Hop..."", so if you like Hip-hop and or fusion style, this DVD will teach you some nice moves. I love the way tribal fusion kind of interrupts fluid movement with a sharp lock, like mayas or omis with a lock. To my surprise I could more or less pick up the moves in this DVD. I do not know if it's because I have been drilling a lot of basic isolations, but I don't think so, because it's more hip-work and chest circles what I have been practising.

It was only after I tried it with Elisheva, that I think I finally got it. Elisheva breaks down and drills, then combines and drills almost in a seamless sequence, so that you can follow her. Of course  you should already know your bellydance basics quite well, since these are not explained. You will need them to build the Tribal Fusion specific moves that Elisheva breaks down for you. The hip-hop additions are also very well explained and drilled in this DVD.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ Excellent instruction for the popping and locking technique.
+ Excellent instruction for a different kind of arm wave (not the usual snake arms that you can find in other BD DVD's). This wave starts in one hand, moves into your chest (either in the form of a chest circle or in the form of a chest slide and pop) and comes out of your body and arm into the other hand. This is done in two ways, with horizontal arms or with one arm up and the other down and then you travel with it. A slight variation is a simultaneous wave of both arms.
+ Excellent drilling that does not feel like drilling throughout the DVD's various technique sections
+ Excellent exercise to get fluidity in your hand articulations, this one you won't see in other BD DVD's and I am sure it will help your hands move more beautifully in any dance form you wish to perform. I found different but also good hand articulation exercises in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diamond-Cut-Bellydance-Precision-Technique-Practice-for-Beginners-with-Irina-Akulenko-2-DVD-Set-belly-dance/dp/B00EZ6FXHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diamond Cut Bellydance: Precision Technique & Practice for Beginners with Irina Akulenko 2-DVD Set - belly dance</a>.

Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used this DVD, the drills included seemed fairly easy with some exceptions. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal when I started BD and other dance DVDs was to get some exercise but in a fun way). If your goal is beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD, but if you really want to learn and drill tribal fusion moves you can easily use and integrate into your dance, then you are best off with Elisheva's DVD.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Intermediate to advanced DRILLS: These are the only drills that do not feel like drilling, they are actually kind of fun (ok it's not like dancing or doing Irina's workout, but for being drills it's probably as fun as it can get) INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Good - Industrial music. FUN FACTOR: High, specially if you consider that these are drills!!!

CONTENT:
1) Nice yoga warm-up flow, similar to Irina's (Sun salutations flow with lunges, down dogs, planks and cobras) followed by some Pilates exercises (crunches) and some squats to end with basic drilling for your upper body undulations. Everything in this DVD is like super specific, even the warm up.
2) Technique 1 - This is like an isolation drilling section (chest and shoulders, arm waves, hips, omis, mayas). All the drills in this DVD are explained carefully and first drilled at slow speed.
3) Technique 2 - This is a layering challenge drill since you practise the movements learned in section one on top of chest shimmies and hip shimmies. This DVD and Rachel's Serpentine include the best shimmy layering sections I own. Elisheva puts a bit more emphasis on the chest shimmy and Egyptian hip shimmy whereas Rachel drills more the 3/4 shimmies up and down (also on relevee) and even Choo-choo shimmy, not only Egyptian shimmy. Rachel's shimmy drill is more cardio intensive and also a bit more fun, but this one is a very close match.
4) Technique 3 - This section includes what Elisheva calls body rocks (like up and down upper body undulations paired with chest and hip shimmies as the beginning and ending part of the undulation). Then you have two different hip hop style travel steps or ""floats"", since you seem to float or glide on the floor. The first is called the ""zig-zag"" and the second is the famous ""moonwalk"". Then you layer some of the previously learned movements on top of this travel steps. I do not particularly like these steps, but this of course is a personal thing, Elisheva teaches you exactly how to do them properly. Finally Elisheva breaks down a cross-step pivot turn, so you have a quite complete repertoire of moves to build into a choreography.
5) Choreography - This choreo is very lengthy (9 segments), I think this is one of the longest I have seen. Since I do have problems in memorizing so many different sequences even in shorter choreos (5 or 6 segments), when I saw nine segments I was immediately scared away. So I will review this segment once I conquer my fear...
6) Performance

MUSIC: Good industrial music, although the Cha Cha in the choreo was not my favorite.

EMPHASIS:
Learning and executing signature movements of the Tribal Fusion style together with some hip hop travel steps and arm waves.",1398729600,2,10159,6.731911652703732
8318354,1,B001LKK6WA,"Tribal Fusion Pop & Lock

I expected better music, costumes, backgrounds and choreography. Was disappointed in all the above, I wasted my money on this one, but like the other 3 bellydance dvd's by other dancers that I bought.",1275350400,,226,4.794871794871795
8318355,4,B001LKK6WA,"At last ... a DVD which makes it EASY to learn the moves by drilling them in an intelligent order.  YAY!  The drills are just right - not too fast, not too slow.  Clear & to the point instructions ... no endless yakking.  This DVD shines simply by avoiding the pitfalls which make so many dance DVDs  annoying.

I purchased Elisheva Pop & Lock as a companion DVD for Anasma's Liquid Fusion.  Anasma is the superior artist, but her material is very advanced.  Elisheva drills the material which was most difficult in Liquid Fusion.  This DVD is advanced beginner - intermediate level.  If you already know dance basics and want to learn ""modern fusion"" style, this DVD is perfect.

Alas, I could only give 4 stars.  Elisheva is a fantastic teacher, but if you want good choreography you have to buy Anasma's Liquid Fusion.  If you can afford it, I recommend to purchase both.  Drill with Eisheva but learn choreography from Anasma.

Happy Dancing!",1262044800,22,946,4.682926829268292
8318356,5,B001LKK6WA,The demonstrations are very clearly shown and there's a good variety of moves. I found this video very useful. I think it's probably more suitable for intermediate or advanced level than beginners. Elisheva is a wonderful dancer and performer. Her moves are very clear and distinct and her instructions are direct and well demonstrated. I liked the combination of bellydance and fun hip hop moves. There's also a coreography. I was very pleased with this DVD and I think it's an excellent value.,1257552000,6,495,4.975903614457831
8318357,5,B001LKK6WA,"Elisheva leads you through an intense experience of learning in this empowering DVD.  Why, you ask, is it empowering?  Because she breaks everything down and makes it all easy to understand and follow!  That also makes it very enjoyable!  The combinations and layering you will learn are fun and versatile.
If you do the entire video, you will spend two hours improving your strength, flexibility, dance movement and mood!  If you do not have the time for all of it, the menu is very convenient to help you get to the portion you want to work with.
Keep in mind, the exercises and moves are not easy:  this is a good workout.  You don't want easy!  Once you learn the moves, the drills section gets you doing combinations, footwork and more layers.
Elisheva demonstrates then teaches a choreography, and concludes with a performance.  You will enjoy watching and dancing with her!
I am not a tribal dancer, but this is one I will keep in my collection because it is fun and adds variety to my work-outs!  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that would like to learn popping and locking for their belly dance!

8318358,5,B001LKK6WA,"My experience with this program was terrific! I enjoyed learning the elements of ""pop"" ""and lock"" and all its variations from this program. I have been intensely working on the choreography which is so much fun. The entire contents, background music, the choreography selection, and the combinations that make up this fabulous modern fusion were very well detailed and brought forth.
This instructor welcomes the viewer with confidence and an impressive background in dance, quickly drawing the viewer in. The lesson plan is superbly planned out. The menu options are usuer friendly and will direct you exactly where you are in the program.

To begin: Intense Yoga warm-up with sun salutations

Level one technique: prepares the upper body with chest pops, circles shoulder locks, broken snake arms, liquid style arms and hands
 Some of  the lower body movements  include piston hip locks, abdomen tucks and release, pelvic squares, downward mayas, etc.

Level two is quite simply a challenging belly dance buffet. Delicious moves such as: arm waves, snake arms, shoulder locks, variations of chest circles, chest pops, upper body undulations garnished and layered on chest shimmies,  very challenging but lovely!!!

 The lower body isolations in this section are layered on hip shimmies such as: omi circles, figure of 8's, pelvic squares, piston hips abdominal tucks and releases; then upper body isolations are layered on hip shimmies!

The drill section is awesome, continuous and directed at the muscle groups that must respond to the choreography to come. The footwork is next, ""floats"" such as ""zig zag"", and ""moonwalk"". Plenty of repetitions and well broken down for ease of learning and yes get ready to layer upper and body moves as well.

Upon viewing the choreography demonstration, I couldn't wait to join in. The music is ""CHA CHA"" by Baltan Beat Box, it is upbeat and modern and there are about nine combinations to learn. It is totally realistic and attainable as it is perfectly exemplified.

The entry level dancer may find this program difficult. The pops and locks are intense..I felt the warm up  is  very disciplined and I mentally prepared myself for it. At a time, I felt as I was in belly dance boot camp? I felt that I left a yoga class and stepped into Pilates, and finally belly dance. HOWEVER......being a serious dancer, I am familiar with the discipline required to prepare the body for the intense moves and layering, at the same time improving precision. Good things don't always come easy.

Because I mostly seek programs that are deeply rooted in the basics, the rewards from this program are bountiful. This great technique elaborates the basics, transtions into advanced moves and the choreography adds the finesse.",1255219200,33,2752,5.084444444444444
8318359,5,B001LKK6WA,"This DVD contains a massive amount of instruction on how to master the art of ""pop and lock"" technique used in tribal fusion belly dancing, with Elisheva's detailed teaching and clear and concise explanations making it easy to assimilate. If you want to learn ""pop and lock"" or are already knowledgeable on it but want some tips to refine and perfect your technique, here's a good place to start.

After Elisheva's ""Welcome,"" you get an excellent yoga based, stretchy warm-up, then you will get a lengthy breakdown of the basic aspects of ""pop and lock"" in the Level Technique sections, then you move on to ""Drills,"" and you'll learn ""float"" footwork techniques, which includes the famous ""moonwalk,"" and will also learn Elisheva's marvelous liquid hand movements. After this comes the choreographed piece, which is fun and has a good slice of humor, thanks to the terrific music, the ""Cha Cha"" by the Balkan Beat Box group.  To finish off, you'll get a performance by Elisheva that fully demonstrates the beauty of her fluid movements and her exquisite technique.

This Pop & Lock Tribal Fusion is an exciting blend of belly dance, hip hop, and other ethnic forms of dance, and Elisheva is a superb teacher. Labeled as ""Intermediate/Advanced,"" you have to be strong and flexible and have some solid dance experience to get the most from this DVD and learn from it with a level of ease. The production on this DVD is excellent throughout, as is the music, which is varied and interesting, especially that marvelous ""Cha Cha""!",1254268800,12,1525,4.88030888030888
