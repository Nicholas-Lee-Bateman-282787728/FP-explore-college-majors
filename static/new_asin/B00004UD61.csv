Although it is easy to see how after growing up watching this and movies of the same caliber, how most video game plots and stories are originated. If you love kung fu movies and suspend everything to watch them it will be ok. If you want some development of characters conflicts and the like then skip.",1365811200,,471,4.488372093023256

2753100,5,B00004UD61,"This is an excellent movie, even though the title suffers from three misnomers and it does not describe the gist of the story ie the third princess of the Ming Dynasty looking for ways to avenge her father in every way, even by SELLING HERSELF. There are also a few inaccuracies. Specifically, the princess is a lady, so, she should be called empress. Secondly, there is no evidence from that movie or historical records that she ever assumed leadership of Shao Lin Kung Fu. If at all, her kung fu is rather inferior. And thirdly. there is no indication that her style is Shao Lin Kung Fu. Chinese Kung Fu has branched to hundreds of style. And even though Shao Lin Kung Fu was preeminent, if one would liked to specify the style of Kung Fu one specialises in, the name of the style must be specified. Not all Kung Fu are Shao Lin Kung Fu. By keeping these caveats in mind, it is correct to describe bloodshed and murderous acts of rebellion as filling this imperialistic kung fu saga set in the Ming dynasty. And with exciting swordplay, bloody fights, and ravishing sets and costumes, this movie is a fierce. regal kung fu action. Finally, it might be well saying that her first saviour who has promised to avenged her father died. Her second saviour betrayed her completely for money and wine. And her third savior, who married her whilst she pretended to be insane, rejected her once he realised that he married a princess. The father, however, was avenged.",1255392000,,1461,4.601532567049809
2753101,5,B00004UD61,"I Know What You Mean 'Morgoth', I Have No Idea Why They Always Try To Rename These Classics. But, This Is The Original Name -- EMPEROR OF SHAOLIN KUNG FU...! The Other Name They Gave It Was ""The Snake, The Crane and The Tiger"", Which I Think Is Really Stupid. But, Watching This Flick With Its Original Title Is Only The Start Of A Magnificent Masterpiece. Lo Lieh Is Pure Sensation, And Carter Really Put Down A Stunning Performance. My Only Negative About This Film Is In The Formatting...! It Was Not Properly Formatted To Fit A TV Screen. But, It Is Truly An Amazing Piece Of Work, One Which Has Or Was Gone Unnoticed By The Great Carter Wong. Absolutely Splendid ! I Wish I Could Give It More Than A 5 Star.",1179964800,4,712,4.32089552238806

8174222,2,B00004UD61,I had envisioned something more exciting in the way of martial arts within this movie. I was disappointed. Story line is not the best either since the main female character has a limb cut off early in the movie. Picture effectively fighting someone who has all their limbs.,1444262400,,273,4.708333333333333

8174226,3,B00004UD61,grew up watching kung fu action movies and I like being able to explain the difference to present movies to the grandson...flying thu the air flips and cartwheels are over the top but makes todays films seem so much better...but the acting ...first class ..lol,1402704000,,260,4.8
8174227,3,B00004UD61,"First off, I really love the quirky things that make some people hate old kung fu movies, and this one had some great quirks.  IT was real fun to watch because there are so many cultural things i didn't understand in it, as usual.  So right there, it's very interesting.  The plot was OK, but gets muddy in the middle.  So much so that you're wondering how they're going to wrap it up when random events seem to start happening... but that was part of the fun and randomness.  The end was pretty satisfying, so i wasn't sad or irritated when it was over.
Only gave it 3 stars because the fights were not extremely strong compared to some similar titles, and i almost stopped watching it when the plot seemed aimless for 20 minutes right in the middle of the run-time.  I'd watch it again some day for the jingles that the guy sings to the girl towards the beginning... so hilarious.",1390694400,,882,4.380368098159509
8174228,2,B00004UD61,The acting was terrible and 30 minutes in I could not believe that I had wasted my time to even view and download to watch such garbage. It's just a plain bad movie! Do not waste your time!!!!!!!! Don't do it..........................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1376524800,,279,5.829268292682927
