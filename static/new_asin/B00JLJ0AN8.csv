8652179,5,B00JLJ0AN8,Ron Howard and Jay Z what more can I say,1408579200,,40,3.1
8652180,4,B00JLJ0AN8,"It is a documentary about a new series of concerts produced among others by Jay Z.
So let me say this from the start, This is a marketing tool, one to advertise and glorify the
concerts, since they are on again for this year.
And Jay Z is a great salesman, but also a great story teller (OK director Ron Howard helps here).
He talks in a way that almost makes you feel that he is your friend, and he has some great
words of wisdom to say (like all rich people wearing gold watches).
But all marketing aside, this is nice documentary, with some great music and some nice stories,
especially from the 2/3 of the RUN DMC, who still wear Adidas on set and can always make people
jump.

A must watch for music and documentary fans",1401840000,2,725,4.215827338129497
