8695712,5,B00RPOZ04U,Very cool to see this show HT looks real happy in this one,1468195200,,58,3.5384615384615383
8695713,5,B00RPOZ04U,"Very well recorded concert by the Outlaw from 2007. Hughie Thomasson and Chris Anderson up hold the whole Guitar Army thing along with Randy Threet on bass. There is a song on here written and sung by Randy called Almost Home. It has David Muse from Marshall Tucker Band on flute and it is really a great tribute to our military. Also on Green Grass and High Tides, Chris Hicks, a former Outlaw, David Muse again on sax, and two or three other guitarist join in for an incredible concert finale. You have got to see this show! I would love to have this show on a CD!",1461888000,2,566,4.25
8695714,5,B00RPOZ04U,"The Outlaws were smoking on this set. This incarnation of the band was tight and on point. Hughie's vocals are crisp and his Strat is biting hard as ever. Chris Anderson's sound is a mix of Billy Jones and Freddie Salem, Randy Threet is laying some thumping bass lines, while Monte Yoho's and David Dix's dual drumming tightens it all together. Song selection is good. The new songs give a possible glimpse into 'Once an Outlaw', with a jam session at the end with Clay Cook and some other musicians on ""GG&HT"". If you like real music, this dvd will not disappoint.",1453507200,2,565,4.549019607843137

Hugh E. Thomasson  And The OUTLAWS At Their BEST, I Love the Added Guest Stars playing with them also ...
The stand out song for me is ""ALMOST HOME""  Hugh is not doing the lead vocals on it but, It's a GREAT SONG.
I have family, Active and Retired from Our Military, So the song is Special ...
 ""The Words Speak for Themselves""
They Look and Sound GREAT ...
Sound and Video Clarity is The Best It could be.
Wish they would offer this one on Audio Cd also",1430265600,2,501,4.144329896907217
8695716,5,B00RPOZ04U,a must have dvd.,1423958400,,16,3.25
8695717,5,B00RPOZ04U,There are no bad recordings that are coming out of HT Audio.  Most bands don't release stuff like this directly to their fans.  This video is so frickin' clear and amazing.  Perfect color and sound!  This was shot the year that Hughie passed so this is sort of his swan song.  He went out with a bang and I have missed him every day since.  I highly recommend this video.  If you are not able to pick up the other one's being offered then GET THIS ONE!,1423612800,2,452,4.126436781609195
