5425080,5,B00AHKLZDY,"To often Yoga dvds for beginners are either really boring, or entirely too complicated, but these dvds are totally different! Tara is obviously an expert yogie, but she is also really good at giving clear and helpful instructions to beginners. Tia is great because, she has the same range of motion as most people, so she makes you feel comfortable when you can't stretch as far as Tara. I always feel my muscles working when I do these, but I am always having a good time!",1355184000,43,473,4.511627906976744
5425101,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I love this DVD and it is a staple of mine within my yoga series!  The infrequent dialogue throughout the duration of this DVD is useful to me.  Being that I'm at my beginning stages of yoga education, knowing why I'm doing certain actions helps me to fully understand the positive results from said actions.  Tara Stiles is a pro!  Beautiful Tia is great at yoga too!  Both ladies working together gives a great calming but strengthening workout!  Would highly recommend the Core Yoga DVD as it's equally as good and even more challenging than the Calm DVD.  Tia gives that girl next door type of feeling that ladies just beginning yoga would appreciate.  Dynamics are awesome between the two ladies.  I even went out and purchased a Tara Stiles DVD set.",1401926400,,755,4.659090909090909
5425102,1,B00AHKLZDY,"I'm not a person who is interested in TV. Therefore, I haven't a clue who Tia or Tara are, or which one is which. I was interested in the style of yoga like the one presented in Calm Yoga w Tara Styles. The preson leading the yoga was great, the person carrying on the chit chat and giggling needs to go. There wasn't a shot in Hades that I was going to reach the level of relaxation I could achieve when I all I wanted to do was mute the ongoing commotion. I cannot understand how the relaxation that can be found in yoga is suppose to occur w all the teen style chatter.",1401840000,2,572,4.026315789473684
5425103,5,B00AHKLZDY,I was very impressed with the DVDs. Tara and Tia did an excellent job in making the routine easy to follow. The moves are challenging but doable. I did the Calm Yoga a few minutes ago and I feel relaxed and stronger. My plan is to do the calm yoga in the morning and the core yoga twice a week. It's a great workout TRY IT you won't be disappointed.,1401667200,,349,4.0
5425104,2,B00AHKLZDY,"I was looking for something slow and relaxing but I felt this was a little to fast for me.  Don't get me wrong, most yoga classes move at this speed but I was just looking for something more relaxing.",1399507200,,200,4.128205128205129
5425105,3,B00AHKLZDY,I love the CORE yoga DVD. Too bad I wasn't able to do the Calming one. The first one I received did not work and they sent me another one and that one didn't as well.,1398902400,,166,3.638888888888889
5425106,4,B00AHKLZDY,"I really enjoy these videos! They are really good yoga poses to do at home and are in a good flow sequence.  I hope that Tia does more yoga videos with Tara.  One thing that I suggest that Tia do if she does other yoga videos: less talk and giggles.  I completely understand that the point is to sort of give beginner some comments of what things are supposed to feel like, what it's supposed to relieve, and sympathize with their pain.  But the last thing you want to hear while doing plank for ten deep breaths is someone giggling.  I still recommend these videos for people.  In fact, I shoved it in the hand of a friend who I felt needed a little yoga in her life!  Great job, Tia!",1397347200,,685,4.183206106870229
5425107,4,B00AHKLZDY,Very good practice and challenging. Would definitely recommend this to a friend! This shows how Yoga can get you in great shape!!,1396051200,,129,4.909090909090909
5425108,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I've been working out for a little while now, but I really get annoyed with how I am not as flexible as I should be. I have also had some stressful days and I heard that yoga just might be the cure. My problem with most dvd's is that you feel like you have to be a professional to do them. Now I have been a fan of Tia and Tamera since I can remember, so this dvd appealed to me quite a bit seeing Tia on it. I have never heard of Tara Stiles, but I feel like these two together really made me enjoy the dvd. Tia is not a professional at yoga, she never claimed to be, but it feels good and less intimidating to watch her be sort of ""imperfect"" with her poses...it makes me feel like I can do it! Tara Stiles also made me feel comfortable as it didn't seem that she forced a pose on you and continuously made sure that the audience knew that they should do only what it is comfortable for them to do. Her poses could be a bit intimidating, but she's a professional and eventually I think I can get somewhat close to what she does, heck I'll be satisfied to get close to Tia's.  I found that the atmosphere of the dvd was relaxed and made a beginner like me feel comfortable.",1394668800,,1174,3.9957446808510637
5425109,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I am a Beginner at Yoga, and I was very happy with this Video.  I love how they explained almost every move and gave tips and where in your body you are suppose to feel the stretch",1394582400,,180,3.864864864864865
5425110,5,B00AHKLZDY,"i ordered this DVD to start my exercise program , It is easy to understand even for beginners . The DVD itself was new , sealed and received fast..",1393286400,,147,4.103448275862069
5425126,5,B00AHKLZDY,I really love this DVD. I'm a beginner and I find it challenging but not impossible. I highly recommend it!,1392681600,,107,4.4
5425127,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I'm a fan of your reality show and was inspired by your choice to do yoga to get back in shape after having your son.  For a long time I have been interested in learning yoga. I'm a 49 year old women in good physical health for the most part. My life is busy and stressful most of the time and I know the risks of that. In my daily life I have always done some yoga. Never in a class structure or by DVD, like yours. Being a bit uncoordinated I wasn't sure if I would be able to catch on quick enough. Your DVD is just perfect for me because you are asking Tara questions that I would have. It made following along much easier for me. My abs and inner thighs were sore like I went running or some other physical activity. To do some structured yoga moves and get the results of a workout is exactly what I was looking for.",1391472000,3,822,3.981818181818182
5425128,3,B00AHKLZDY,"I really like Tara Stiles' videos, but I didn't quite like this one. If you think Tara talks too much, you wouldn't believe how annoying would be to try to do yoga while listening to Tia Mowry's laughter. She makes fun of everything, and it's more like a friendly practice between friends than a workout DVD. The ""Core Yoga"" DVD is almost unbearable because of Tia, who looks more controlled in the ""Calm"" DVD (thank God!). Great to learn the flows and practice them by yourself...",1389139200,,481,4.604651162790698
5425129,4,B00AHKLZDY,"I started with the Core Yoga workout, and I absolutely loved it.  I like how Tara Stiles incorporated strength moves as well as stretching throughout. The stretching portions allowed my wrists to receive a much needed break as I am a novice to yoga and don't quite have the wrist stamina :)

The Calm workout was good, but did not live up to the ""weight loss"" claim on the front of the DVD.  I wore my heart monitor throughout the workout and burned only 160 calories.  The emphasis should definitely be more on calm as it is nearly all stretches with little to no strength moves. Having said that, however, I will still incorporate this workout into my exercise routines as one of my goals is to increase flexibility.

My biggest complaint, as others have highlighted, are the conversations between Tara and Tia and most notably their laughs!  It's not enough to make me never use these DVDs again, but those laughs are going to take some getting used to.",1389052800,,956,4.594117647058823
5425130,3,B00AHKLZDY,These are great yoga videos. I feel the beginners video position are still moderate to advanced. I really worked myself to a dripping sweat attempting to keep up.  I would not suggest the beginners video for yoga newbies or those with moderate to severe medical issues (check with your physician before starting).,1388016000,,313,5.019230769230769
5425131,5,B00AHKLZDY,I am very happy with the shipping! It got here in 4 days and i got this for my sisters birthday whitch is tommorow and it came just in time! She really wanted this video for a couple of months now. The pricing was great and so was the shipping i know she will enjoy thi. :),1387152000,,273,3.807017543859649
5425132,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I love Tia, so I decided to try her Yoga DVD. At first it was hard to keep up, but I got the hang of it. I enjoy doing yoga and stretching. I plan on using both DVD'S everyday.",1386720000,,176,3.5384615384615383
5425133,5,B00AHKLZDY,"This DVD set is charming and fantastic for beginners. if you are a fan of The Mowry Twins, you can't help but enjoy these Yoga videos. Tara Stiles does a great job giving instructions. This will be great as a gift or for developing an at-home yoga routine,",1386633600,,256,4.354166666666667
5425134,3,B00AHKLZDY,"I was so excited about this set and found myself disappointed. If you are a Tia Mowry fan then pick it up just to say you own it. If you are looking for a good workout, keep looking.",1381104000,,182,3.8157894736842106
5425155,5,B00AHKLZDY,Love the DVDs and how easy it is to follow along or go at your own pace. Very relaxing music and the conversation between them is fun welcoming. I can pop them in the DVD and workout in the morning before the kids wake up.,1379721600,,222,3.9555555555555557
5425156,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I love Tia an Tamera and it's refreshing to work out with Tia. It feels like family! Thank you for always creating ingenious products for woman to improve themselves with. God has blessed us with both of you and it's truly a blessing.

5425158,5,B00AHKLZDY,I'm just so in love with theses DVDs! I wouldn't think I would love them so much the way I do or even like to do yoga this much! They came in the main just with in 2 days after ordering them. Thought it would come in a DVD case instead of like card board case. I would recommend theses DVDs to anyone! Keep up the great work Tia and Tara! =),1377820800,,341,3.75

5425160,4,B00AHKLZDY,"This DVD set is great.  I especially love the core yoga dvd, because I really feel my core working (And I really want a tight flat core) and I sweat just enough doing the moves.  I've done some of the moves before in a class, but I like that Tia and Tara take things slowly, while still providing a challenge (because I am not a sissy!)",1376784000,,336,4.075757575757576
5425161,5,B00AHKLZDY,Bought this for my daughter who loves Tia and yoga. It was all she expected. It is a bit long but flies by fast.  She is picky about her yoga routines and feels it is well structured.,1376697600,,183,3.945945945945946
5425162,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I really like the DVD that has Tia doing the tree pose on the cover.  While I was working out with that DVD, I didn't feel like I was getting much of a workout, but I definitely felt it the next day!  Boy were my abs sore!  The other DVD wasn't as much of a workout.  It was more of the typical relaxing yoga.  I decided to purchase this set after seeing Tia film it on her TV show on the Style network.  She keeps it real for the beginners, and I liked that aspect of it because I'm not a super yogi!",1376006400,,501,3.8155339805825244
5425163,4,B00AHKLZDY,"Tia is such a cutie!  I share her passion for yoga and appreciate that she shared this workout.  My daughter loves to watch Tia & Tamara reality show and I just happened to be sitting with her when the episode of Tia making this DVD came on.  Curiosity got the best of me, so I looked it up and purchased it.  These DVDs are a feel-good, relaxing stretch.  Ashtanga yoga is my favorite, but I like to mix it up with workouts like this.  Namaste, Tia.",1376006400,,450,4.174418604651163

5425185,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I LOVED this workout DVD! I wasn't sure if I would like it but it is better than I expected! The Calm Yoga DVD was very relaxing but still a good workout.

5425187,4,B00AHKLZDY,"I have tried a few Yoga dvd's and this one is my fave so far. Easy to follow and no stuffy at all.  Yes Tia does ""interrupt"" frequently but I think that  makes this dvd different.  Also if you watch her show you know that its just her personality coming through. I have added this to my daily routine. Cardio at the gym in the morning and Yoga in the evening.",1375056000,,359,4.028169014084507
5425188,5,B00AHKLZDY,"So I just got finished viewing both DVDs I wanted to view first to know exactly what I'll be doing, but while viewing I couldn't help but get on the floor and start my routine let me say, ""OMG""! I can actually feel my stomach muscles working I know if I do this on a regular I am going to ROCK my abs. It's not hard for us beginners and it's good to see Tia doing it and working up a sweat. I'm looking forward to working out, can't promise I'll work out every day but I can definitely give it 4-5 days. Thanks Tia.",1374969600,,515,3.914285714285714
5425189,5,B00AHKLZDY,"These two DVDs provide a great option for a quick yoga session, whether you want a challenge (Core Yoga DVD) or some relaxation (Calm Yoga DVD). They are easy to follow at home, with a style of yoga that I have not come across previously. Recommended!",1374710400,,251,4.478260869565218
5425190,1,B00AHKLZDY,"The irritation and interruption of Tia's girlfriend nervous giggles makes this an unfortunate product. Without that silliness and foolishness, Tara does great yoga dads",1374364800,,168,6.041666666666667
5425191,4,B00AHKLZDY,"I am a mom of 3 with no real child care options, so I needed a way to exercise from home.  This is a great solution.  I am able to follow the routines and modify them to accommodate my needs.  My 4 year old also likes to do the routines with me and is able to follow well (plus he thinks it's fun!).  As mentioned in other comments, there is a bit of giggling, but I don't find it too obnoxious.  I think this is a good way to prepare for the day I am finally able to get to a real in-person class",1374278400,,497,3.7403846153846154
5425192,4,B00AHKLZDY,He dvr's are a great way to get you in the practice if doing yoga daily. I really appreciate the DVDs and the simplistic form it is in.,1373587200,,135,3.857142857142857
5425193,2,B00AHKLZDY,I tried this yoga dvd because I thought yoga was more fun than doing an actual workout. I put on this dvd at first it was going good then we kept doing the same moves over and over. I love Tia Mowry on tv but on this video she was not as fun. Her jokes were lame and her and Tara sit and giggle the whole time getting on my nerves. I couldn't tell if I was doing the moves right at all. Tara's instructions were horrible. Tia kept asking questions the whole time it truly was a hot mess. After  20 minutes I just cut the video off and took a nap. I don't feel like I even worked out. I feel tired that's all. I am not sore or anything. Only thing we did was child play pose and downward and upward dog 20 times. And some warrior girl stand. The Dvd sucked. Do not buy this. Waste of Money.,1373500800,,789,3.8703703703703702
5425194,5,B00AHKLZDY,"This is a great 2 dvd set.  I am a beginner so this set will last a long time.  I have a lot to work up to.  Tia and Tara make a great team.  It is informative, fun, and great for your health. I enjoy it very much!",1372982400,,214,3.3958333333333335

5425197,5,B00AHKLZDY,I wanted to get into yoga for quite sometime now but every DVD I got would bore me. Until I found these :) they keep me interested and I think Tara and Tia make a great team! I am on day 20 and do them just about every day. I feel great and I can tell I am toning up. I Love these DVDs :),1372464000,,288,3.4461538461538463
5425198,5,B00AHKLZDY,"This video is so laid back and fun to do! The first time I did the CALMING DVD, my one year old joined me on the mat for the first time. It's great to be doing yoga not only with Yogini Tara Stiles, but also another African American mama who has such a passion for yoga and let's you know it's ok not to be ""perfect""! Thanks, Tia, for following through with making this DVD! My little one (she loves seeing Cree!) and I will keep watching you & Cree on TV, and definitely keep meeting you on the mat!

5425199,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I wanted to start practicing yoga -- and I heard about these DVDs when I was watching Tia & Tamera's show on the style network... so I bought them. I was a bit skeptical, but suckered myself into it. And I'm so glad I did. I love these DVDs!

I started with the calm yoga DVD. And, as a beginner, I have to admit -- I still broke a sweat doing it. It was very challenging at first, but I practiced until it got easier, then moved onto the Core Yoga DVD. The Core Yoga definitely gave me a good workout, but it wasn't too hard that it felt completely out of reach.

I started practicing about 6 months ago with these DVDs and I've made so much progress. I've moved on to tougher routines and classes, but I still come back to these DVDs from time to time. I'd recommend the Calm Yoga for mornings or right before bed and I liked doing the Core Yoga DVD after cardio as a good strength builder.

I really think yoga has contributed to my weight loss, along with a healthy diet and solid cardio a few times a week. I'm happier, stronger and healthier than I've ever been, I plan to practice yoga for the rest of my life and these DVDs were the perfect to start to the new me!",1370995200,2,1172,4.086956521739131
5425200,5,B00AHKLZDY,"This dvd set has two routines. The calm series is very simple and easy to follow, after completing it I feel very relaxed. the core series has some harder moves, but I can still follow it easily. I started Yoga as a more athletic hobby in addition to my gym work. So far these DVDS have been a perfect addition, and I love how they make me feel : relaxed, happy, and well-stretched.  I recommend the set for any other person who is looking to introduce yoga into their daily routines!!",1370563200,,485,4.329670329670329
5425201,5,B00AHKLZDY,I am new to yoga and not necessarily the most in shape person. These dvd's are great and don't require too much space to do them. The core workout definitely works your core and gives you a great workout! It's so encouraging listening to Tia talk about how she started with yoga and continued with it and even though it might be tough just to keep practicing. Great beginners yoga and very step by step. The workout is repetitive with little twists to keep it interesting and keep you engaged. Great stress reliever and calming after a hard day!,1370476800,,545,4.515151515151516
5425202,5,B00AHKLZDY,I'm not the type to write reviews but I had a blast doing both DVDs. If your reading this please buy it you won't regret it!

5425215,5,B00AHKLZDY,I definitely recommend these two DVDs! After only one time doing the core yoga DVD I could feel my abs and I felt so loose and calm. I do the core yoga during my son's naptime then the calm yoga after he goes to bed. I LOVE these yoga sets!

I wanted to get in shape but after walking for so long, I just get board with it and quit.  I now alternate yoga and  bike riding and I love it.  Even though I can't get all of the moves yet I enjoy trying.  As a 44 year old African American woman, weight is a big concern for me.  These yoga CD's  give me a good work out.  I feel so good after doing yoga.  Yoga is my exercise of choice now. I can't wait until your next series of yoga CD's come out,  I also love watching Tia and Tamera on the style network.

5425223,5,B00AHKLZDY,Found even the core dvd sort of relaxing with the music behind it. The ladies working together make some of the more complicated poses even more fun because of their light way conversation and laughter. Thank you Tara and Tia for putting out such a quality dvd set for newbies like me!,1365465600,,285,4.5
5425224,4,B00AHKLZDY,I find this workout a good supplement to my gym workout. It's very basic and easy to understand. It's definitely works out your core.,1365379200,,133,4.583333333333333
5425225,5,B00AHKLZDY,"Love, Love, Love, this girl and her yoga.  I started this video a while back and oh my goodness the hurt in me the next day, but well worth it. It's easy to follow and very down to earth not all snobbish like some videos.  Great for beginners!",1365033600,,243,4.041666666666667
5425226,5,B00AHKLZDY,"Tia did a wonderful job with this beginners Yoga video. I have seen a lot of beginner videos, but this series is the one I reach for. Tara does a wonderful job taking you through the moves and explaining them.",1365033600,,209,4.25
5425227,5,B00AHKLZDY,"So I know it was Tia's idea to do a yoga dvd, but it's pretty much run and created by Tara Stiles.  Seeing as Tia is not a yogi guru, she needed someone like Tara to do the DVD with her.  So I really look at this as a Tara Stiles dvd, not a Tia Mowry dvd.  With that said, if you have any other Tara Stiles DVDs or have done any of her yoga videos on youtube, you know that they are amazing and she's an awesome yoga teacher.  The best!  These dvds are no different.  Whether you are looking to try yoga for the first time or if you've been doing it for years, these dvds are great.  I really love the clam yoga dvd - so much so that I haven't even used the core yoga one yet.  I can start the dvd being really tight, maybe even annoyed if I'm having ""one of those days"" and definitely in need of some ""me time"".  When I'm done with the yoga dvd, I always feel like gumby and in such a better mood overall.  As Tara herself says, ""If you can breathe, you can do yoga!""",1364688000,,968,3.8434343434343434
5425228,4,B00AHKLZDY,"I would not say this yoga video is completely for beginners.  The pace is a little bit faster for someone who is a beginner.  I by no means am at an intermediate level or the most flexible person, but I was able to keep up with most of the workout. I know that after I do the workout more, I will be able to do more the moves full out.

My only complaint about the movie, and why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the excessive talking and laughing that goes on.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Tia, don't get me wrong, and Tara is a genius when it comes to yoga, but they have conversations alot throughout the movies and it kind of interrupts the ""zen"" of it all.  I tried the core dvd first and that one is a quicker workout so the talking wasn't as disturbing.  I just did the calm yoga and I expected there to be less talking, but there wasnt.  It is kind of distracting and disappointing because Tara Stiles knows soo much about yoga and directs you to do the moves in such a great way.  Tia is also pretty flexible and is a good example of how yoga helps you get back in shape.

Overall, I will continue to use these dvds as a workout, maybe  not for the purpose of completely getting calm and 'zenning' out.",1364515200,,1206,4.050632911392405
5425229,5,B00AHKLZDY,It's a great work out and they are easy to follow.  If you're new to yoga it's a good starting set.,1364169600,,99,3.7142857142857144
5425230,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I'm fairly new to yoga. I've taken Yoga classes at my local YMCA and I have purchased several yoga DVDs but this is truly a Yoga Beginner Gem. If you've never done Yoga before this is the perfect video for you. The moves are easily executed, the flow is very plus size friendly. I've read the other reviews and a few have commented about the chatter and laughter on screen. I feel as though it adds to the experience, especially as a beginner who may be nervous. It's almost like you're working out with a gal pal. I have been a fan of Tia and her sister Tamera since I was a young girl and I loved her personality and energy throughout this set. I have been recommending this set to all my family and friends who are curious and interested in doing Yoga. I even have my children doing Yoga with me. I look forward to more videos from Tia.",1364169600,,839,4.217391304347826

5425232,5,B00AHKLZDY,I love this yoga video!  The video is easy to follow and not hard to do.  I can feel the difference in just a few weeks that I have been doing it.,1363996800,,146,3.53125
5425233,5,B00AHKLZDY,I love both of these videos the are great for beginers or someone who has been doing yoga for years. They are both calming and a great workout with modifications if not needed. If Tia made more videos I would buy them!,1363910400,,218,4.214285714285714

5425245,3,B00AHKLZDY,"I wanted to bring some yoga into my workout, and saw this on Tia and Tamara show. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this DVD. I did the routine a couple of times and decided this was to advance for me, to say this is for beginners is a joke. I decided to do some more research and found Jane Fonda had a beginners yoga DVD out, I looked at the reviews and decided this might be the one for me. I do like the Tia's dvd and will go back to it once I become better and stronger at the routines.",1363737600,,505,3.8653846153846154
5425246,4,B00AHKLZDY,"These are definitely beginner level DVD's(and I'm not a beginner) but I liked them. I have a lot of lower back issues and these are workouts that I can do when my back is flared up. I really liked the Core workout. I can see myself doing this one a lot. The Gentle one was okay, but I have other DVD's that hit that same type of workout that I like better. I found the chatter/chatting not so relaxing. That would be my one ""criticism""...there's a lot of chatting but not much instruction. So even though its a beginner program I'm not sure I'd get my form right if I was a beginner. There was really no instruction on where to place feet, where your hips should be pointed, etc. And, there's not enough cuing for breathing during the vinyasa parts. All of that didn't really make a difference for me b/c I've done yoga for a long time, but if I was just starting out I'd be confused (and probably my form would be off). There is no spiritual vibe at all. Its more athletic/stretch.  Nothing wrong with that at all, just mentioning it because if you are looking for something with a little bit of spirituality in it, this won't be for you.",1363219200,,1139,4.297674418604651
5425247,5,B00AHKLZDY,Loved this. Especially for a beginner! It was not hard to follow and was not annoying like other DVD workouts I have tried!,1362787200,4,123,4.391304347826087
5425248,4,B00AHKLZDY,These DVDs are a great place to start.  They're challenging but not intimidating. I've used them for a few weeks and have seen results.,1362787200,,135,4.625
5425249,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I am a huge fan of yoga and since I am unable to attend the yoga class I was taking at the gym I have been on a constant hunt for a great yoga dvd.  I've always loved Tia and was so excited when I found out she was coming out with a yoga series.  I have watched bits and pieces of both dvd's and can't wait to get started on the program.  Definitely ""a worth it"" buy..great great !!!!!!!!!!!!",1362700800,,392,3.875
5425250,5,B00AHKLZDY,I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about taking up yoga. I began yoga some years ago but I stopped and began taking up kickboxing. Now that I am doing yoga again I decided to purchase Tia's yoga DVD because her and her sister are great role models! The DVD's were great I love them both. The Core Yoga is my favorite I just did it this morning and I am really feeling the burn!: ),1362614400,,397,4.037974683544304
5425251,4,B00AHKLZDY,"The calm yoga DVD was just that. It was perfect for me after completing a vigorous workout that had me sore and tightened up the majority of my muscles. It really helped me to release all that tension and stretch out all those tight muscles.
The core yoga DVD really worked out my core. I enjoyed it. I also felt really relaxed with all the counter stretching. I would definitely recommend both of these DVDs.",1362096000,,409,4.466666666666667
5425252,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I am a yoga beginner who was looking for simple basics with the primary goal of relaxation and de-stressing.  I chose this series because I am a big fan of Tia and feel like she is a ""normal"" woman, like myself, and not a yoga ""expert"".  I loved the series!  It was great having a trained yoga expert to explain the moves and techniques while I was able to relate to Tia and her friendly and warm attitude, as well as her typical hysterical commentary.  I felt more like I was relaxing with friends than in a ""class"".  I have used both DVD's and highly recommend them both!",1361923200,,573,4.268518518518518
5425253,3,B00AHKLZDY,"...but, it was a total waste of money. I guess it's cheaper than a gym membership. Let me explain:

Wife sees Tia Mowry's show. Says, ""Oh wow, she lost so much on yoga alone (uh huh). I need to get that and then once I'm tired of it, I'll start going to the gym, etc. etc.""

Well, that lasted 3 days. I guess it's a good thing that she got this before wasting money at the gym...",1361750400,,379,3.909090909090909

5425257,5,B00AHKLZDY,This was a very calming experience. Tia is very down to earth and both instructors kept the momentum going. I would recommend this series to any beginner student as an soothing way to learn yoga.,1361059200,,195,4.6
5425258,5,B00AHKLZDY,"Due to me being a fan of the Mowry Twins and my desire to change up my work out routine, I was willing to try this DVD. It is relaxing and I enjoy listening to Tia chime in with a moderate version of some of the moves. I actually look forward to working out!",1360972800,,258,3.7962962962962963

5425260,5,B00AHKLZDY,I tried the calm dvd last night for the first time.  I've tried yoga before and only had success if I took a class.  Most beginner dvd's are just too difficult to follow.  This was GREAT! I was able to do all of the poses and did not feel overwhelmed.  What made it even better was that my 4 yo and 19 mth old were in the room doing it with me!  Tonight is core night.  If I can get close to Tia Mowry's figure I'll be ecstatic!  Great DVD Tia!!  Thanks.,1359936000,3,454,3.858695652173913

It's pretty cool but at time I have to rewind to pick up on what exactly Tara Stiles is saying. I did it with my sister and all she kept saying was, ""what, is that woman saying"", it wasn't that bad to me but it would help to hear her clearer.",1359936000,2,360,3.8133333333333335

5425264,5,B00AHKLZDY,I really like the experience I get with yoga. It really does stretch you out while relaxing you and a great workout. With the core dvd you will be sweating within the first few minutes. This is my first time doing yoga and I will continue along with my routine cardio. Tara's voice is so soothing too and I love Tia.,1359763200,,316,4.19672131147541

5425279,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I love these yoga routines.  The calm yoga is a little easier.  Core yoga is a great ab work-out. They are long enough for me to destress and recharge after a stressful day, but short enough that I can fit them into my day.  I would definitely recommend.",1359158400,,254,4.25

Tia and Tara work so well together and made me laugh at times. Tara is awesome with guiding you and giving you tips with each move. Tia is amazing at following through with the moves and makes you relax because we are on the same level. She made me feel at ease not being an expert. The calm yoga is my number one, it really makes you so relax and calm it takes about 45 mins overall. Best 45 mins. ever. I usually do not fall for at home videos, but this was a great chocie. I hope Tia and Tara come out with a large series. I am ready to BUY!!",1358985600,,663,3.846715328467153

Also it took a month for me to get my product and I had to contact the company twice, via email, which was frustrating. I did not have this issue with this company previously so I would still order from them.",1358985600,,483,4.094736842105263

5425295,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I wanted a good, but calming workout. Like everyone I vowed to ""get back into shape"", but wasn't ready for the boot camp type DVD's. The Core Yoga video is really amazing. I was surprised at how much I could do as a beginner, but there are still lots of things to get better and work up to (like the crow pose). I love that in this 45 minute video, you are pretty much moving the entire time. There isn't time spent teaching you to do the pose, just talking your through it and trusting your body to find its way. Many beginner videos focus so much on teaching you never really get to break a sweat. This video allows yoga to be the exercise it was meant to be - challenging in a gentle sort of way.
The conversation or chatter isn't too much. Think I will be able to stick with this for some time and maybe work up to more complex videos by Tara Stiles. I think Tia Mowry is good at showing the modifications for poses for beginners and would love to see this pair team up to do an intermediate series next.",1358726400,,1008,4.121827411167513

My husband also tries to participate but he says his body just doesn't bend for yoga haha (he's more of a runner and cyclist). We both feel pretty good after following the dvd though.

5425301,5,B00AHKLZDY,"Tia is so down to earth in this yoga series as she talks about different poses being hard and laughs at herself when she finds the sweet spot in certain poses.  Her personality is what made me feel not so foolish as I panted and puffed my way through the exercises...lol.  This didn't feel like a beginners level to me, but that's because I've been sitting on my behind for the past several months hiding from anything that resembled exercise.  If that is you too, then prepare to be challenged but you'll be better for it!  Tia doesn't mimic Tara's moves exactly (she does a couple of modifications in both dvd's, I think) so you don't feel bad when you have to modify.  Tara is so flexible and graceful that wanting to move like her keeps me motivated.

When I finished the first workout I felt like I could do anything. I was strong both physically and mentally. Yoga is so great at relaxing you.

5425341,5,B00AHKLZDY,"I really love these Yoga DVD's. I am a beginner and these are perfect. I have purchased other yoga DVD's in the past and they were either too hard to follow or the instructor would just talk way to fast. Tia and Tara are great in these DVD's. Easy to understand and very very relaxing! Tia and Tara, thank you so much for getting me back into yoga again!!",1356912000,5,355,4.159420289855072
5425342,2,B00AHKLZDY,"I was elated to purchase Tia's yoga dvds.  However, I am highly upset at the Watch it Now seller!  In addition to getting mixed updated information about the tracking status of the package (the dvds FINALLY arrived), the cases are dented and cracked, and the cases and cds are laden with an unbearable and sickening fire/smoke smell!  I can't stomach the horrible smell and I am seeking a full refund!  I will try purchasing the product directly from Tia's website next time maybe in the future.  Right now, I don't even want to bother risking having the same horrible experience! I'm just glad this was a gift for myself and nobody else.",1356652800,,638,4.660714285714286
