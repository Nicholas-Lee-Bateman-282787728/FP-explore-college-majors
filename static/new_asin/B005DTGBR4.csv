8467462,1,B005DTGBR4,"This documentary shows some places on earth where some people believe they are or were the gates to hell. It is a riveting idea. However, in the end, it shows such things exist only in people mind. There is no scientific proof that they are true. Amazingly, History channel stretches this should-be-15-minute documentary into a 90-minute one!

If you are reading this, I am saving you some money and 90 minutes of your life. If you still want to watch this, try to borrow it from your local library or somebody else.",1418428800,2,516,4.608695652173913

8467464,5,B005DTGBR4,"My sister was the one who actually suggested I watch this and after reading about it I decided to go for it! I'm glad I did. It is very entertaining, can be long at some parts but if you're into macabre kinds of things and/or learning about other religions/cultures you will find this very fascinating. It is not overly religious where it pushes you into believing one way or the other but it does really makes you think about life, death and religion and what could happen to us after we die.",1363996800,4,493,4.369565217391305
