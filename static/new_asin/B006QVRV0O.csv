5013686,4,B006QVRV0O,"I have not yet proceeded through all of the lessons, but the instruction is clear and the notes in the book all seem to be accurate, so what more is needed?  I would have appreciated a spiral binding so the thing stayed open.  4 stars.",1375056000,,235,4.2
5013687,5,B006QVRV0O,"This was a unique approach to learning the Ukulele.  There are two Volumes, both excellent.  No matter what level player you are or aspire to be, this is an approach to go back to repeatedly as your skill level increases.  Bob has distilled the core techniques necessary to master this instrument.  I play the Baritone Uke and both volumes are easily adaptable for my instrument.  If I had to only buy one learning set, this would be the one.  Start here!  More than worth it.",1372032000,,476,4.529411764705882
5013688,5,B006QVRV0O,"The other night I sat down and watched Bob Brozman's Ukulele Toolbox Volume one. Bob is a great player and a great teacher. On this video he teaches you how to play the ukulele not how to play songs on the ukulele. There is a lot of information in this video, some for the complete beginner, but mostly the lessons seem to be aimed more towards people who have some musical background but may be new to the uke. He starts out with right hand techniques that are applicable to players of any level. He then moves on to chord positions, progressions, and turn arounds in several keys. Bob does a good job explaining but, given the limited time, he goes over things pretty quickly. I think a person with some basic knowledge of chord structure and chord progressions (things like, I - IV - V, or I -VI - II - V- I,  etc.) could get a lot out of this video. Basically you get couple lessons with a master musician for only 20 bucks, too bad you can't stop him to ask questions or pick his brain, but I think if you watch it and take what you can, you'll get your money's worth and more.",1362355200,12,1082,4.201923076923077
5013689,5,B006QVRV0O,"As a graduate level musicologist and world wide performer of over three decades Brozman shares his formidable knowledge and teaching skills in creating a true ""Toolbox"". In the same manner that a box of the correct tools can build a house, overhaul a '66 Chevy and assemble a child's swing set this DVD equips the viewer to take on the multifaceted world of the ukulele. Theory in bite size pieces,strums of a variety of styles, finger picking and chords of all flavors are in this DVD. Not at all overwhelming and not leaving you at ""Tiny Bubbles"" wanting more this is the Swiss Army Knife of ukulele learning. I own a stack of native Hawaiian instruction manuals as well as an equal number of ""haole"" books. Brozman is the winner here. Bob will tell you where is taking you and how you will get there and what you'll have when you arrive. His suggestions for learning to form chords is unique and invaluable. You want to learn uke?

5013700,5,B006QVRV0O,"Bob is a very good teacher of the Ukelele. I'm a pro guitarist and picked up a 'uke' just for kicks, and this DVD was really helpful in pointing me to some important tips and tricks to getting started in the right direction. I found this tutorial immensely helpful and much better than a tab book. It comes with a book you can print out too.",1400198400,3,341,4.181818181818182
5013701,5,B006QVRV0O,"Bob Brozman has created a wonderful tool box for ukulele enthusiasts. He manages to offer something for beginners and intermediate players in a very engaging and sometimes challenging way. Sooner or later, if you are uke player, you'll want this disk. And think about this, the price of this disk is about what you'll pay for one uke lesson at your local music store, but the disk can be revisited time and time again and it contains much more info that you'll get in a half hour session with a teacher.",1397088000,4,503,4.538461538461538
5013702,5,B006QVRV0O,"General observations: Over 2hrs of instruction from the late Bob Brozman. The video has a stream of consciousness, conversational tone. The presentation jumps quickly from concept to concept. Be prepared to pause and run back. If I was just starting out, and new little about music, this video would probably overwhelm me. As an intermediate player, I found much that was interesting for me to work on.

5013705,4,B006QVRV0O,"I liked his simple approach to chord and figure positioning as well as the music theory.  He would work the scales of notes withing the chords and the group of chords.  It is a good practice lesson.  However, I would have liked him playing more songs and with the words to the songs.  I felt like I was toning up most of the time.  However, it is good for practice, practice and more practice.",1388102400,4,393,4.256756756756757

I am so impressed with the amount of useable information too. I showed it to my 'uke teacher and she is getting it! My ex is a life long musician and even in the Kansas Music Hall of Fame and he is very impressed too. In fact he says to get the good DVDs as they are always there. And THIS is a great one. I am 62 years old with a accident brain injury and so learning for the first time a musical instrument is important as it is indeed healing my brain. So, want to fight old age and dementia?

Much more exciting then the standard learn a simple song, learn a slightly more difficult song, etc approach, not to mention better info. It's a lot to learn so it seems a bit fast, but that because there a lot of info for you on this video, and you'll need to create you own pacing. The instructor is just right too- doesn't get on your nerves or distract with personal traits. I suspect there's info on here that will improve amateurs who already know how to play.

8503229,4,B006QVRV0O,"As a newbie to ukulele I have to say there is a lot of information and skills that will require a lot of practice on little bits of this DVD at a time. This toolbox format might not work for everyone but my suggestion is watch it through once then go back and take small bites and chew them well....a little bit of DVD and a lot of practice until you get comfortable with whatever tool you picked. I play drums, percussion and guitar and believe music is a passion not a hobby because it takes a ton of dedication and practice but the rewards are life changing.  I am learning a lot from this #1 DVD and have #2 also but it will be some time before I get to the #2 DVD. I recommend these toolboxes to those who expect or know that what you get out of these will be equal to what you put into it. There is nothing easy about learning any instrument but there is a lot that's fun and rewarding. I have been creating music for over 40 years and I have received no compensation or discounts for this review. Jump in and practice, practice, practice.",1478390400,3,1045,4.147783251231527
8503230,5,B006QVRV0O,This is the second most helpful teaching tool I have found for the Ukulele.  the number 1 helpful tool was Mr. Brozman's first book. Bob knows what he is talking about and explains it in a easy way to understand.  I true beginner on the ukulele can understand and start to play along with the first lesson.  Everything from tuning to playing the ukulele is extremely well done.  Great job Mr. Brozman.,1477612800,,401,4.527777777777778

In this handsomely produced and brilliant dvd is one of the most exciting progression of lessons possible.
Not one thing about this and the other volume is boring because he points you in the firection of mastery from the beginning with the most easy way of learnng to strum and the inviting you to use your creativity in
Everything a beginner or seasoned layer would want to know is herre and the soft spoken hard struming style and brilliant teaching are a must have learning without being bored to death doing coming round the mountain or whatever.",1429228800,2,658,4.681034482758621
