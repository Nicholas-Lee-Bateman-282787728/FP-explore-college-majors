8405263,4,B003TLUKX4,"For the first half hour, I really thought this film was going to knock
me out. It's combination of disturbing experimental elements; strange,
loud Glenn Branca like rock music that banged in and out, long shots
that were just studies of faces or rooftops, etc. It seemed like it
would be a portrait of working class life that was more poetic and
surreal than literal.

But gradually the film gets more 'normal', and a regular story comes
into play; the familial relationships and romances of three working
class buddies. There are some striking moments of honesty and surprise,
but some serious problems, first among them being that these unknown
actors aren't quite up to the delicate complex task of taking these
people and making us believe them as real. Under-acting alone isn't
enough to ground a character film. That under-acting still has to be
filled with interior life. But here, too often, the performances just
feel a little amateurish and monotone. There's also a running fantasy
element that's a bit sophomoric.

That said, there's enough strength and originality in the visual style,
and a number of unexpected story points that overall I still found this
worthwhile, and will be very interested to see what Mr. Bradshaw does
in future. It's just too bad this is just a good, somewhat awkward
film, rather than the transcendent film the opening minutes promise.",1383264000,,1375,4.973913043478261
