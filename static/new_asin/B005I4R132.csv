8474228,5,B005I4R132,"Here's a double feature promised over a year ago from Wild East Productions and it was definitely worth the wait.  Continuing their Spaghetti Western volumes of the films of Peter Lee Lawrence aka Karl Hirenbach, this pair is much better than their first volume which consisted of Lawrence's later excursions.  Up first is 'KILLER ADIOS' -1969 which has the much better title of 'WINCHESTER ONE OF ONE THOUSAND' in this transfer.  This film focuses on the gun of the title similar to Director Anthony Mann's excellent 'WINCHESTER 73'-1950 but the similarities stop there.  It emerges as a convoluted murder mystery and could have been made in any genre.  Director Primo Zeglio directs his scenes in long continuous takes saving the film editor alot of work and which gives the actors alot more to do.  The script by Zeglio, Mario Amendola, and Mallorqui Figuerola gives it the tone of an American made western by having less action and also a tom boyish teenage girl usually played by Pamela Tiffan or Shelley Fabares but is represented here as Marisa Solinas who is brilliant and goes through a personality catharsis after the death of her father.  Lawrence is a gunslinger who returns to his home town after a few years in hiatus due to a botched gun duel and finds a lot of changes.  The beautiful Rosalba Neri does what she does best, playing the femme fatale but unfortunately does her scenes confined in one room.  The villainy is represented by two excellent actors Eduardo Fajardo and Nello Pazzafini who are perfect in the red herring department but the identity of the murderer is a true surprise.  The melancholic score by Claudio Tallino and gorgeous camerawork by Julio Ortas rounds out the mix.  The transfer is adequate in its original 2.35 ratio and has its own picture gallery and US trailer as extras.  The best is saved for last with 'KILLER CALIBRE 32'-1967 directed by Alfonso Brescia aka Al Bradley who directed Lawrence's best pasta oaters and is a first rate actioner with bar room brawls, beautiful distractions by Agnes Spaak and Helene Chanel and villainy by Nello Pazzafini(again) and Andrea Bosic.  You'll also view a blink or you'll miss cameo by Director Mario Bava stalwart Massimo Righi. Lawrence is bounty hunter for hire Silver who has to solve  a series of stage coach robberies and again gets involved in a murder plot. The music score by Robbe Poitevin is more James Bondish than Spaghetti but has a catchy whistle motif throughout which uncovers one of the bandits who accidently starts whistling it and is gunned down by Lawrence who finishes it. Fulvio Testi's camerawork is rich and colorful showing off the beauty of its leading ladies and claustrophobic closeups in the bar scenes. Brescia zips the action along making this one of the better lesser known Spaghetti's and shows why Lawrence had quite a following in Europe.  Diagnosed with a brain tumor, he took is own life in 1974 never garnishing the respect he deserved.  The transfer is flawless in its 2.35 ratio with not a scratch on it and making it look like it was made yesterday. It has its own picture gallery and US trailer as extras.  It makes a perfect companion piece to Volume 1 and hopefully Wild East will continue releasing Lawrence's other oaters.  Again, thank you , Wild East, for continuing to preserve the underrated Spaghetti Western Genre.",1325462400,7,3359,4.852889667250438
