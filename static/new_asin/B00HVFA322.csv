6229577,4,B00HVFA322,"Also known as ""Armour of God III."" Jackie Chan stars as Martin, aka Asian Hawk in this action comedy. Chan delivers as expected. Heavy action, comedy, and over choreographed fight scenes.

Chan is a master thief who uses his ability to steal art work. His latest job is to find and obtain the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese zodiac which were stolen in 1860. The movie has a theme of western civilization plunder and returning the loot.

The beginning was great with Chan being a human toboggan during his escape, even if he went faster than physically possible. The scenes lessened from this point as a smart adult action comedy turned into a kids movie by the pirate scene which included one man who reminded me of Johnny Depp.

The ending tapered off as the plot became a bit odd with the volcano. Fun popcorn film. Just don't expect too much.

6229579,2,B00HVFA322,"I got the export version of this movie and the audio was so bad at times that I could barely make out the conversations; most of the time, it sounded muted, like the sound was coming out of a box. Menu only offered language and subtitle selection and chapters with no options for audio selection.

Audio issues aside, this is very much a typical JC movie, with lots of amazing stunts (now aided by wires as JC is getting much older) and typical JC silliness- enjoy for what it's worth. Too bad about the audio or else I would have given it another couple of stars.",1395878400,2,564,4.320754716981132
6229580,4,B00HVFA322,"This is a very good story with an important message. It's not him running up walls, but the fight choreography is solid, and some of the stunts are creative. You'll enjoy it.

I just adore Jackie Chan. He has given me many years of jawdropping amazement. He is arguably the 'greatest'/'biggest' international star that there has ever been. Certainly the most nail-biting.

I'm glad to see a little hollywood slight-of-hand at the end. Sometimes I worry he's going to kill himself for our entertainment, and he's already more then paid his dues. Lately I find myself hoping to see him in more comedies or using his cinema skills to make the chinese culture more understandable for 'us westerners'.

But, he hasn't decided to mellow out yet. At one point of this movie, I found myself with my hand over my mouth repeating ""ohmygodohmygodohmygod""

Stay for the lifetime collage at the end credits and my sentimental review will make more sense.
Wow.",1395705600,10,946,4.857142857142857
6229581,1,B00HVFA322,"109 minutes?!?! The Hong Kong version I bought last year is 123 minutes. Typical U.S. companies cutting scenes out to shorten the films for American audiences for no reason. I never understood that. People are paying almost $20, let them watch the full version. We have to let the distributors know that we don't want the quality standards lowered for us. It's offensive to all movie lovers in general.

That being said, this film is just okay.. Not Jackie's best. Some of the humor falls flat. Fans would still want to see it. Just don't buy this version. My copy also includes a 3D blu ray of the film. I have to say that the film is NOT good in 3D. Just watch it in 2D. I still give this blu ray 1 star!",1395705600,26,706,4.268656716417911
6229582,5,B00HVFA322,"Im shocked that I am the first to write a review for this!?! First off I have been a student of Martial Arts since i was a young boy and I look up to the greats like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li and so many others. Jackie Chan movies are always the most enjoyable because of his charisma, martial skill and stunts! Chinese Zodiac serves as the 3rd installment movie of his 2 older movies series Operation Condor or Armour of the gods (for all the diehards). The first 2 were amazing love those movies watched them many times over and over and I will do the same with this one! You can tell JC put a lot of time, effort and heart into making this movie and it shows. It has top notch Martial art/action, stunts, comedy, etc... it very much brings that old JC movie vibe back, Jackie you can tell made this one for the fans, it really is a great movie and good way to wrap up the Operation Condor trilogy.

6229624,1,B00HVFA322,"Not even close to what you would expect from Jackie Chan.  This is the 3rd movie with his Indiana Jones-style character and it is forgettable.  Poor attempts at humor.  Jackie Chan barely fights or does any action in this film.  And it was a big deal that Kaitlyn Deschell; a former XMA competition star, was going to be in it.  Well she's barely in it, and her fight scene was pointless.

Save your time and save your money.",1440028800,,425,4.384615384615385
6229625,2,B00HVFA322,"Back in the day, I saw several of Jackie Chan's movies and enjoyed them, however, I'd hesitate to call myself a big fan of his work.  Still, I remembered the fantastic fight sequences, so when my roommate brought home Chinese Zodiac and asked if I wanted to watch it, too, I agreed.  Sadly, it should have been much, much better.

JC (Jackie Chan) has been hired to track down the twelve bronze statues of the animals from the Chinese Zodiac any way necessary.  That's a good thing since he is a thief for hire.  These particular statues were stolen from the Chinese one hundred and fifty years ago.  A few are popping up in the market, but no one knows where all of them are.  Can JC and his team follow clues to track them down?

Now often, I will say that the plot is just an excuse for the action.  That doesn't necessarily mean the plot is bad, it just means the plot is just setting up the action.  In this case, it means the plot is bad.  It jumps from plot point to plot point with no real explanation or at times logic.  A few of the complications felt like the writers saying, ""We need to have another fight sequences, so let's introduce pirates.""  Yes, you read that right, real day pirates make an appearance.  The climax, while thrilling, also made little sense and came out of nowhere just to give us an awesome final fight scene.

Character development?  Again, much of that is forced.  Things are thrown in at random that are supposed to help us identify with the characters better.  This was still happening in the final, wrap up scene of the film.  Instead of liking the characters, it made me laugh at the clumsy way it was handled.

I'm willing to give the actors a pass on the acting.  The film was a mix of sub-titles, accented English, and voice over.  Between the three, I was so busy trying to follow the story that the acting wasn't a big issue for me.  It wasn't good, but it was horrible, either.

What was horrible was much of the voice over work.  Many of the actors delivered it with such flat voices that I was pushed away by the woodenness of it.  I felt like these ""actors"" just wanted a paycheck and didn't care about the final outcome.

Along with this, we get preached at about who should really have stolen artifacts taken from the original peoples are displayed in European cities.  I actually agree with what the film was trying to say, I just hated the way it was said.

So why watch the film?  For the action sequences.  The opening epic scene is worth it for the sheer fun of the film alone.  There are many other great scenes scattered throughout the film, including a fight entirely on a couch.  No, I'm not joking.  And the climatic moments just be seen to be believed.

Even so, I highly suggest renting the film, or better yet borrowing it from someone else who has rented it like I did.  There is no reason to watch this film more than once.  After you've seen the action scenes, you'll have no desire to watch Chinese Zodiac again.",1434499200,,2981,4.374087591240876

There are many characters in this film and I felt that there should have been a little more character development. The fights don't seem as intense as in the earlier films because the villains don't want to kill JC, they just want to stop him. In the earlier films the villains were more deadly. The film needed more humor, a deadly villain and a strong love interest. This was the edited version so I am assuming that many key points were edited out. JC himself edited the film by about  20 mins for North American audiences to maintain a brisk pace. Amazon please make the unedited version available.

6229677,3,B00HVFA322,"You don't expect much of a plot in most Chan films and this one is pretty basic: JC (as he's referred to in the American dub--not as his Asian Hawk character that older fans of ""Armour of God"" and ""Operation Condor"" are familiar with) is an adventurer thief who, along with his crew, track down pricey artifacts many of which have been plundered from the treasure troves of many a country, including China. Oliver Platt shows up as a doughy scheming arts and artifacts broker and his appearance in a distinctly Asian film took me out of the film for a moment I must admit; he was a waste in this film. Anyway, JC and his crew are tasked to track down the twelve bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac and get paid big bank if they get them all. What ensues is a focus on their first few conquests and it all feels haphazard with some quick editing and scene changes that would make a music video director feel at home. As Chan & co. (two younger men and a female partner) go on to ingratiate themselves with and bamboozle a group of young activists dedicated to the repatriation of national artifacts and a Parisian heiress interested in Chan's abilities to help her uncover what might have happened to her grandfather we are treated to Chan breaking into a rich Parisian's home and then narrowly escaping an attack by a group of Doberman pinschers and a trip to a southeastern tropical isle that feels like Chan is plumbing for some of that 'ol Indiana Jones plus Pirates of the Caribbean magic. But the magic just isn't there.

The scenes with the collector's bumbling security guards sticking up Chan's team with guns that aren't loaded (!) only to be shot at with real bullets from some south seas pirates (one looking more than a tad like Jack Sparrow) fulfills that old Keystone Cops feeling that Chan could pull off in some of his older films but it misses the Buster Keaton marks that made those films such classics. But fear not because the scene is about to change dramatically again after Chan's troupe decides to play nice and help the artifact activist's head science gal get her captured brother and friends back. Of course these kids were taken by some of the brokerage house's goons because the activists are succeeding in getting the public to back off of buying stolen national treasures.

Once we get to the goon squad's hangout, an underground high-tech factory that helps to restore and replicate lost antiquities and art, Chan faces off with a new person, a rival artifact hunter. The two have a couch fight (...yes, they fight while managing to stay in physical contact with a couch....) and this fisticuff leads into one frenetic fight sequence to another and, while not Chan's best (come on, dude is getting up there in age) it is quite entertaining and shows off some of that old Chan magic. This last third of the film that also includes a skydiving fight sequence saves the film (along with the opening sequence with Chan in a high-tech skateboard suit--it was fun and would have been fantastic if a younger Chan was able to apply himself to it). This portion of the film is why you see a JC film in the first place.

The feature is capped off in usual Chantastic fashion with a series of bloopers and missed stunts and a moving collage of sorts of scenes from his entire career but there are two additional ending points that I've never seen before in a Chan film: (1) Chan himself gives a brief voice of thanks to his worldwide fandom while patting himself on the back over how proud he is of his accomplishments and (2) there is a Guinness World's Record note at the end of the credits that cites Chan as holding the record for accomplishing the most stunts in movies by an actor who is still alive! As to the first point Chan's voice talking to the audience felt a little self-indulgent; if a popular American actor did this he would be endlessly mocked but Chan's that peculiar talent who is driven to connect with his audience so I get it. As to the second point...that's just totally cool.",1397865600,,4020,4.5497237569060776

The acting is kinda bad, but that makes the movie even more enjoyable. Lots of cool (and dangerous) stunts. It is remescient of ""Rumble in the Bronx"" for comparison to style.",1397433600,3,341,4.7
6229679,1,B00HVFA322,Can't believe they released this without the original language track. Couldn't get more than 10 minutes into it before the dubbing drove me crazy. Why release an English-only version on Blu-ray?,1397433600,2,194,5.290322580645161
6229680,3,B00HVFA322,"It was good, but parts of the movie were disjointed and one thing did not lead to the other.  It was apparent that Jackie is not doing all his stunts any longer, but that is ok he deserves some time off he is no longer young and the ones he did took their toll on him I am sure.  Still it was a good film and look forward to seeing more in the future.",1396828800,,351,3.72972972972973

6229682,1,B00HVFA322,"Cartoonish in plot, storyline, script, directing, acting. Just a mishmash of ripped off scenes from action movies of the past 20 years. The usual lost/stolen artifacts being pursued by thieves, governments, collectors with the usual Bond type toys & action scenes except they were so corny dumb they provoked me into ff button action to escape the boredom. Even the Chan martial arts scenes were poorly performed and should have been executed. On top of all that the English voiceovers were distractingly miscast resulting in voicing & dialogue that grade schoolers would find laughable.

There was one scene, emblematic of the the whole movie, where Chan from an outside fire escape landing could have stepped through a very wide open, below waist high, window to enter an apartment. Instead he does a roll over the sill into the room. It was like watching grandpa get out of his sofa chair. It looked old, tired, poorly executed and unnecessary. All the actions scenes had that same vibe.",1396656000,,990,4.963855421686747

8636411,1,B00HVFA322,"C'mon Jackie yeah can't just pump out movie and expect people to go just because of you. Story line stupid, predictable, and slow. Acting is like a high school drama club. The action can't and shouldn't try to hold up a movie if the story line is at grade school level. I have loved Jackie Chan movies over the years and it seems like he is relying more on his past than making movies that the future will love...",1532044800,,413,4.2405063291139244
