330875,5,6301423682,"Because I like the genre (film noir) I sought out this film on advice of a friend.  Although, at the time, it was scarce, I am glad I persevered!  The cast is a surprise - imagine Sting as the standout in a dark drama!  He nearly steals the show!  The setting is interesting and the direction superb.  This is one of those films that lets you fill in the blanks and causes you to concentrate on each scene so as not to miss a nuance or clue.  I found that the second viewing was more than twice as entertaining!  I have now seen it four times; each time very enjoyable.  Sean Bean was an unknown to me when I first saw the film, but has now become just about my favorite actor - you can see him at his present best in LOTRFOTR as Boromir.  In Stormy Monday, made in 1988, he plays a young, blonde, strangely naive fellow with a mystery past (never revealed).  Tommy Lee does his expected great turn as the villian (among several in the tale), while Melanie Griffith makes the most of a role-type for which she is well known, the girl-gone-wrong who overcomes her bad luck.  You will find a lot to enjoy in this dark story and a chuckle or two also - from the wild Polish rock band!",1028764800,13,1181,4.18141592920354
330876,4,6301423682,"A slick noir piece set in Newcastle, England (yes, Sting's hometown), Stormy Monday is a little-known but beautiful film by Mike Figgis (also the director of ""Leaving Las Vegas"").  When guileless Irish drifter Brendan (Sean Bean) arrives in town, he befriends a shady nightclub owner Finney (Sting) and falls in love with a ill-used waitress, Kate (Melanie Griffith).  As the film's off-beat, strangely elliptical plot advances, all three characters find themselves at odds with a villainous real estate developer, Cosmo (Tommy Lee Jones), who is busy snatching-up an entire portion of the city.  (Presumably, Cosmo plans on turning it all into one giant shopping mall, and the film works nicely as a commentary on American-style ""globalism"" masking good-old American greed.)  When Brendan thwarts an attempt on Finney's life (Finney is the last business-owner refusing to sell-out to Cosmo), he and Kate become bystanders in a power struggle between the two men--a situation complicated by Kate's moonlighting as a call girl for Cosmo.  As the love story between her and Brendan unfolds-played out against a darkly lyrical backdrop of underworld violence--the film perfectly captures both the promise and menace of the 1980's.",1020902400,6,1227,5.403141361256544

330878,4,6301423682,"...This is a gangster movie with a twist. Alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Melanie Griffiths you find Sting ( carrying coals to Newcastle indeed) and Sean Bean. The plot is pretty straightforward, mafia boss comes to do a deal on Tyneside and tries to get rid of the minor obstacles in the process. The movie goes along a la Long Good Friday but without the mystery and menace. Gratuitous violence is liberally sprinkled around as are the shots of the city. Nowhere in the movie do we have a shot of the city of Gateshead located on the opposite bank of the river where the Michael Caine movie, Get Carter was filmed, but the movies themselves have some similarities.
In the end Sting and Sean win the day...
All in all an enjoyable gangster flick with a Geordie accent. Has a lot in common with that Geordie TV series Spender starring Jimmy Nail with incidental music by my old friend Tony MacAnaney also worth watching if it is ever shown in your area.",1015632000,6,951,4.502890173410405
330879,4,6301423682,"Stormy Monday is the title to a song that is played at the end of this film. This is the story of Brendan played expertly by the young, brash, handsome and swaggering Sean Bean with an earing in his ear, wearing tight blue jeans and browsing job listing, he becomes an employee of ""Sting"" at a club. And meets Kate, whose boyfriend, Cosomo played by Tommy Lee Jones, is a real estate tycoon who is trying to buy up the town! Its a story of lost love, the love that is lost and destroyed between Kate and Cosmo and its the new love between Kate and the wonderful new man that she has found, Brendan. Its Sean Bean at his best, he is an excellent choice for Brendan, he sports an earing, and can play musical trivial pursuit with Sting, which is funny to watch. If you are a fan of Melanie Griffith, you will enjoy her performance as Kate, and Tommy Lee Jones does a calm, and cool job as a real estate developer.
If you are a fan of the wonderful british actor, Sean Bean, this is a must see film! Enjoy it, its hard to find, and its one of his best roles! And yes its also nice to see Sting as the club owner too!",1014336000,5,1113,4.0867579908675795
330880,5,6301423682,"Im a big Sting nut, and I have to say that Stormy Monday is Sting's best acting Movie! The preformance he gave to this movie made him like he was in the movie business his whole life!  Not Music.
Its special to see that  the setting was in Newcastle, England (Sting's hometown)
Tommy Lee  Jones(fugitive) and Sean Bean(Golden Eye) both did a excellent job!",940204800,11,356,4.53125
330881,5,6301423682,"How can this movie be so unknown and underrated?  The cast is swell: Tommy Lee Jones makes a terrifically creepy/suave villain -- he's worth the price of a rental alone.  Melanie Griffith is quite appealing (and how often is  that the case?)  Sean Bean has one of his earliest starring roles, and he's  great, and Sting rounds things out in a role tailor-made for him: jazz club  owner.  The movie is full of clever moments and artistic touches. If you  like a good suspense drama with romance, and especially if you like  nightclubs and slick jazz, this is a fine choice.

Tommy Lee and Melanie are in their usual 80's typecast characters, so no stellar or surprising performances to be found here, it is the story line that has the ""best performance"" claim here.

Stormy Monday fell into this generality, but like others of the genre that I have seen, it held my interest enough to keep me watching, waiting for the something to happen. When it was all said and done, I had a hard time deciding, ""3 stars [noir doesn't rock my boat] or 4?"" I gave it 4 stars simply because the rollover for 3 is ""it's ok"" and for 4 is ""I like it,"" and I liked it. The story-line, almost 30 years later, is a bit cliched but in the '60s my father maintained ""no one has written anything original since Shakespeare,"" (which I still believe) so cliched isn't much of a problem for me (hell, even Star Wars, which I love, isn't really sci-fi, it's 'soap opera in space').

The actors were so good that the pairings & the plot seemed natural.  I didn't really understand why a business transaction for one place required extra ""pressure"" from the prospective buyer, but maybe that's what happens when a crazy businessman wants something he can't get. Perhaps it was more about politics as he had some fake celebration occurring with senators,  gratuities, women & hit men.

That having been said: The ""finer"" (i.e., extenuating) points attributable to ""Stormy Monday"" were: (1) the moody atmosphere that lingers inexplicably like a piquant aftertaste, long after the film has exhausted itself; (2) Sting's languid expressions that appear to denote a serene, ""I've-got-everything-well-under-control"" type-of self-confidence; (3) the brief (why couldn't there have been more) shots of Sean Bean's naked body; and (4) the perplexing (but admittedly amusing), back-and-forth wavering of trying to make up your mind whether you liked (or didn't like) Melanie Griffith's somewhat ambiguous performance.

331258,4,6301423682,"This is not your usual approach to directing. While most directors keep their eye on the ball, Mike Figgis spends a lot of time filming the crowd.

Here's the scoop. Through some happenstance (maybe a bit too much) the lives a few people converge on the same scenario. It's America Day in London. Melanie Griffith is trying to ease out of being an ""escort"" for Tommy Lee Jones who's in town trying to forcefully wrestle Sting's jazz club from him. Sting hires a young, pre-fame, Sean Bean to clean the club. Sean bumps (literally) into Melanie. They start a relationship and the pot begins to boil.

As I said in the intro, Figgis spends a lot of time putting people in the frame that have nothing to do with the central story. This lends a quirky flavor to things. It's as though he says that people and stories exist outside of the main story and these people and their stories will exist long after this one plays out. The script here is Okay. I seem to remember things I saw in it originally that weren't here now. They must have been edited out, though I can't figure why. It's a rather basic plot line with some drama but not a huge amaount. It probably could have used a few more twists and turns. I've seen too much of Sean Bean as of late and I've grown a bit tired of him. It was nice seeing him here before he became a household name. Melanie Griffith, as usual, looks better than she acts. She's not bad, just not really good. Sting is Okay and Tommy Lee Jones is his usual great self. The music score is very good featuring some nice jazz interludes.

I can't say this movie will change your life, but it's a good exercise in playing with film language. If you want something left of center this should do you just fine.",1366675200,,1733,4.342592592592593

331264,5,6301423682,"The most important aspect of the Stormy Monday is the structure. The story begins in fragments that are unrelated but that ultimately connect later in the film. We meet the main characters of the story seperately but at the same time, which is before they meet each other. Furthermore, the main plot of the story is not revealed early in the film, so the viewer is suspended. However, Free Jazz just landed in New Castle (from Poland) and is ready to destroy! Sting welcomes this evil force into New Castle, but Tommy Lee Jones is quite opposed to Polish Free Jazz. (Griffith can't be bothered by Free Jazz, she's New Wave).

Going back to the importance of the film's structure, the viewer will notice that as the film approaches it's climax Free Jazz and The Blues battle for survival in this small English town of New Castle. But The Blues is number one! Tommy Lee Jones makes a play to own New Castle, but will Sting take the bait? Will Free Jazz take over New Castle with its structureless Polish saxophone solos? (A deleted scene shows New Wave artist MICHAELmATICIAN attacking Sting with a drum machine taped to a car's analog alarm clock).

The movie has all the features of a good noir, most of all a feeling of impending doom throughout, which a good noir exhibits. You know some bad things are going to happen, but you just don't know what and when. That uneasy mood runs throughout the film.

Add some tough characters, great cinematography (nice colors, too, in this case) and even a good blues music score and you have an interesting film. The story here revolves around a ruthless American businessman trying to buy up an entire block of the businesses in one area in Britain.

There's humor in here too with a goofy Polish jazz band, which looked and sounded just awful, and just enough action throughout to keep from getting too talky. Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean star and all are fascinating to watch.",1241049600,4,1025,4.559782608695652
331267,4,6301423682,"One of Mike Figgis' first films, Stormy Monday fuses an intriguing mix of American greed, crudeness, and innocence with British coolness, toughness, and civility.  But added to the mix, interestingly enough, is a Polish element (more on that later).
One American is Melanie Griffith as a cocktail waitress and vaguely defined moll (or former moll) of the other, Tommy Lee Jones, a ruthless moblike businessman who plans on making Newcastle, England his own--commercially, of course.  (Political takeover is a little hard to imagine circa 1988).  Melanie emits a sexy blend of sensuality and innocence, pretty much irresistible.  The British are Sting, as the owner of a club (a role he neatly reprised in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels), and Sean Bean as his cleaning person/gofer.  Both are civil and, as it happens, tough as well.  And Sting's coolness is in the ultra category, a real neat piece of work.
Sean and Melanie meet and then do a whole lot more;  they do the romantic thing, all the while being pursued, as is Sting, by Tommy's henchmen.  Tommy plays rough, as it turns out.  The mingling of Yank and Brit romantically (Melanie and Sean) is paralleled by battling of Yank and Brit commercially (Tommy and Sting).
The Polish element?  Melanie's character is half Polish, and, as well, the band slated to play in Sting's club has an accident so the Cracow Jazz Ensemble (or some such), all Poles, steps in instead, among which is Andrej, a sympathetic band manager, the only one who speaks English.  Andrej is destined to play a critical role in the film, but rather than provide a spoiler here, see the film to understand what this means.
Violence plays a large part in the proceedings, as is obvious from the above description.  This is a well-plotted film that put Mike Figgis on the map.  Doesn't hurt that he not only wrote and directed it, but also composed the music for it, an effectively moody jazz score.

7811938,1,6301423682,Was a pretty bad movie. Not only was it boring but the story behind this flick did not make any sense.,1523491200,,102,3.9047619047619047
7811939,3,6301423682,"I can remember when STORMY MONDAY was released. To my knowledge it never played in local theaters near where I lived. My first exposure to it was in video form. With Melanie Griffith, Sting and Tommy Lee Jones being popular at the time it was one I ordered for my shelves. Even there it didn't fare that well. It is another of those movies tossed out with no fanfare that is interesting but never found its audience. That may change with it being released on blu-ray.

The movie has several intersecting stories that culminate into one as it moves forward. The first involves Kate (Griffith) as a waitress and possibly part time mistress for a high roller. Unhappy with her life he calls to have her go buy a new outfit and join him that night. The second is a young man named Brendan (Sean Bean in his second major film role) who bumps into Kate knocking her over at the mall while reading the want ads. He in turn applies for a job at a local jazz club owned by Finney (Sting). Hired hes sent to pick up a visiting jazz band coming in from Poland. He takes them to a hotel for their visitwhere Kate shows to meet up with her part time boyfriend Cosmo (Jones).

To tie it altogether it turns out that Cosmo is in town to help celebrate America Days, a business effort with the city of Manchester. His plans are to revitalize the area, tearing down current buildings and creating new jobs and opportunities. His major problem at the moment is that the owner of a jazz club, Finney, refuses to sell. Brendan meets Kate once more when he stops into the restaurant she works in to eat.  While there he overhears the plans of a couple of thugs to rob the jazz club and convince the owner to sell. The rest of the story unfolds from there.

So a lot of the story here seems to be one piece of the puzzle conveniently fitting into the next over and over again. I found that to be a bit distracting while watching this movie. The fact that each of these characters run into one another in a city the size of Manchester, that the interest of all involved all revolves around one small club, just feels too contrived to be believable. Yes, I know its a movie but still with this many items one after the other (including the remains of a car wreck entering the city later referenced which places the Polish jazz band working for both Como and Finney) tying into one another it pushes it a bit far.

The film is incredibly easy to watch though. The cinematography is wonderful with plenty of stylized lighting and sets combining to make it appear to be a location thats seen better days yet has several areas of interest anyway. This is in part due to the fact that it was shot by Roger Deakins who had shot SID AND NANCY the year prior and went on to shoot THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, FARGO, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, SKYFALL and more. Director Mike Figgis also went on to bigger things including directing LEAVING LAS VEGAS. For some reason his star never rose much higher than that film though.

Arrow Video is releasing this and they remain one of a handful of companies whose releases should be met with enthusiasm and excitement. The prints they off are always the highest quality and this one is no exception with a beautiful hi def edition of this movie. The extras here are limited but make the movie itself more interesting. They include an audio commentary track with director Figgis moderated by critic Damon Wise, a video appreciation by critic Neil Young discussing the city of Newcastle and how it relates to film especially this one, the theatrical trailer, a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Jacey and for the first pressing only a booklet written by critic Mark Cunliffe.

Fans of mysteries, film noir and British crime films will find this a must have for their collections. Movie fans will find enough to enjoy in the film itself. And if you love all things Arrow Video like I do, it is one more movie to add to the shelf.",1502323200,,3979,4.457417582417582

IMPORTANT NOTE!  Amazon has a habit of grouping all reviews of ALL editions of a film release together. Before reading a review, not the date of the review. (You can also sort by newest first. That will show you which reviews are applicable to the product you want.  This is a review of the Special Edition BD/DVD released on July 18, 2017)

is the second special edition re-release from the British label Arrow Home Video Films ( a video company specializing in horror films, distributed in the US by Music Video Distributors) that Ive reviewed (one, Crimes of Passion with Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins, was released last year and garnered a five-star review from me). And, while it was great seeing the film again after 30 years (Im a big Melanie Griffith fan!), it was the bonuses and packaging of this new reissue that make this worth getting.

This was Director Mike Figgis first FEATURE film. Prior t9 this he had only made a film for Britains Channel Four. (This film was co-produced by that TV network as well). Stormy Monday was filmed in Figgis hometown of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in Northern England, and then Figgis moved to the US and made his most well-known film: Leaving Las Vegas. . For SM Figgis not only wrote and directed the film, but composed the jazz score. He cast Newcastle-born musician/actor/composer Sting (then recently from the band The Police) as a major character (this would be Stings Last major movie). Add to this Tommy Leigh Jones and British actor Sean Bean and you have a great cast. The production team members later went on to earn lots of Oscar nominations/wins.

The film is called a Romantic Thriller. The plot (corrupt real estate tycoons, loan sharks) is nothing special but the cast (Griffith is a redhead here, and Jones has not a speck of gray hair) and the photography are what make the 93 minute film worth watching.
The film is Not Rated. There is violence and brief nudity  Bean is shown fully naked from rear twice, and there is a VERY brief glimpse of Griffiths breast once.

But, as I said, above, its the extras that make this edition special. The package contains BOTH a BD and DVD. While the BD has an HD transfer it was one done in 2010. It is full screen 1.85:1 aspect ratio. There are English subtitles (though you probably won't need them. There is a full length commentary with Figgis. As well as a fabulous 33-minute featurette where film critic Neil Young explains the history of the film, as well as some fascinating background on Figgis and the cast (which I won't spoil for you here  but watch it AFTER you see the film). This featurette was made in May 2017 with Young standing at key locations from the film.  And for the first pressing only the package includes 16-page booklet with a five-page essay on Figgis career  plus photos.)

All three of the Arrow releases have been class acts and I  for one  am anxious to see what else is in the pipeline from them.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7811941,4,6301423682,"Not sure why this movie gets so much hate, but my guess is some of the reviewers were turned off because they perceived it as anti-american (the villain is an American gangster capitalist who reminds me of Donald Trump lol).  A lot of the films appeal for me is it's gritty depiction of Newcastle in northeast England (where Sting is originally from).  It does give a sense of that particular place in the 1980's.  A good atmospheric film as long as you can buy into its politics- which is that American capitalism is ethically compromised and exploitive in some instances.  Frankly I think that why it has such poor ratings- some folks just didn't like the way the American businessman was portrayed.
