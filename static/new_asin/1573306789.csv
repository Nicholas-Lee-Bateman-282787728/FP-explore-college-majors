192123,2,1573306789,"This was the first exercise tape that I ever bought.  The dance routine is broken down so that it is easy to learn and it is definitely fun to do.  Although this tape got me excited about starting to exercise, I would not recommend this tape to most people.  This tape failed to get my heart rate up and I really didn't see any results from doing it 3-5 times per week.",1028592000,4,369,4.097222222222222
192124,4,1573306789,"This is a great workout, but I think you need an itty-bitty dance background to really love it. The only reason I didn't rate it a '5'  is because after 4 months I'm ready for a new one. I don't care much for Eric,  but Patricia is an enthusiastic, down-to-earth choreographer who makes the tape fun.",964051200,2,300,4.339285714285714
192125,1,1573306789,"From reading the other reviews and seeing a teaser on another MTV workout, the ""Advanced Total Body Training,"" I purchased this video.  Terribly disappointing.  This was NOT a Fat Burning workout.  After the  eency-weency warm-up (with unsafe, ""bouncing"" lunges) there was  one and only one skimpy little dance routine to learn.  The instructors  take so much time to explain each part of the routine, and then you do that  section up tempo just once, that your heart rate does not have a chance to  climb up to ""fat-burning"" levels.  Then they move on to teach the  next section and your heart rate plummets. And then, boom! the cardio  section is over.  Definitely not enough.  For real fat-burning, you need to  have more than 20 minutes of cardio in the aerobic range.  While the moves  on this video were doublecool plus cool, (although I would feel like an  utter dolt doing them in a club) and the dancers were animated and fun  (Eric Nies does have a most delectable, divine body), I'm afraid the music  was pedestrian and uninspired.  Once through this video is all I can stand  because I deplore wasting my time, especially when I want a good workout.  For far superior fat-burning, try Karen Voigt's ""Energy Sprint""  or Kathy Smith's ""Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning.""",957830400,11,1281,4.797235023041475
192126,5,1573306789,"This is an excellent workout for those in the beginning/intermediate levels.  If you are advanced, this may not be enough for you.  This video has one of the best instructors I've seen in a long time, and you will have  so much fun dancing with the group!  You will stay motivated and full of  energy.  Keep in mind that you need some coordination and dance ability to  do this, however no special flexibility or anything like that. Eric  actually keeps his mouth shut for most of this video, which is nice.  This  video is so much fun don't miss it!",957052800,9,550,4.41
192127,5,1573306789,"I have been using this video for 2 weeks now and have lost about 4 lbs.as a result (2 lbs a week- not bad!) I wanted a video program that was fun, upbeat and interesting enough to get me committed. MTV Grind Workout-Fat Burning Grooves was just the thing. The instructors make sure that you  understand the steps. The music is great and Eric Nies is gorgeous! Best of  all, the instructors look as though they are having a great time. Working  out shouldn't seem like work--it should be fun--which is exactly what this  video is all about!",956361600,16,539,4.469387755102041
192128,4,1573306789,"Loosing weight doesn't come easy! This video is a great start i think. I'd say you'd have to be good with your feet to keep up, but its not difficult. They break everything down for you!",954374400,,186,4.194444444444445
192129,4,1573306789,"I run, kickbox, workout with weights, ect. I wanted something new and fun. My sister recommended this video and I am definetely having fun with it. I like the cast and the music. The moves are new for me (you might have to  watch it a couple of times) but once you get the hang of it, you will be  grooving!",953769600,2,307,4.016393442622951
192130,4,1573306789,"this tape is definitely a fun, inspired workout. i love the instructor and the mtv dancers. they show you the steps b4 they do them and break them down. i love this workout. it is intense if you want it to be or a light  one when you choose it to be. buy it! you will see the results after a  couple of weeks.",948844800,2,309,3.8125
192131,4,1573306789,"I bought this Video because overall the reviews were great.  I viewed it with an open bind and wow!  it was fabulous!  Nothing is worth it...if there isn't a challenge!  I have now used this tape three times a week for  5 weeks and to date...have never been bored!  Its great to see a cast of  so many personalities, body types and looks!  I feel  its all up to the  individual but Eric definitely is an inspirational, motivating figure!",942019200,3,437,4.417721518987341
192132,4,1573306789,"This was my first hip hop kind of dance aerobics video.  I loved the Fly Girls on In Living Color and was looking for that kind of dance workout.  Since then I have ordered all the other MTV Grind videos.  I particularly  like this one because of the instructor Patricia Moreno.  She is so  positive, so buff, and relates to Eric Nies very well on tape.  I am sixty  years old (wow) and have no problem following the moves, although I have  been dancing all my life.  I am sending a copy right now to my little  sister.",940982400,4,519,4.1938775510204085

7798261,5,1573306789,I love this video. It is a lot of fun and makes you look forward to your workout. The steps are pretty easy to learn. (And I personally love a little 90's music.) I have kept a VCR solely for the purpose of doing all my MTV Grind workout videos on VHS.,1458172800,,252,3.8653846153846154

7798264,5,1573306789,"I bought all the Mtv Grind workout when they first came out! I LOVED them!!! However, I lost my entire collection among other things when I moved! I was so sad! I forgot about them and thought about it when I decided I needed to get my butt in gear and lose weight! I only wished they would convert these videos to DVD's!!!! I will need to dust off my VHS player so I can get these videos again!! The ABSOLUTE best workout and fun video ever! They go over each dance ""workout"" step by step and it is SO much fun to do!",1325548800,,518,3.9903846153846154
7798265,5,1573306789,"This video is absolutely fantastic for those who love to dance and don't mind repeating the moves until you perfect them.

The instructors are Eric Nies (who is one of the best-looking men I've ever laid eyes on) and famous choreographer Patricia Moreno.  Both flirt with each other throughout the entire video but I think it's cute.  You also have members of the MTV Grind crew that you've seen in other videos.

The music is very modern, edgy and mostly hip-hop and techno.  It makes the workout fun and upbeat.

This video was definately made for a younger crowd since the heartrate chart they show starts in the teens.  The routine is dancey and big with some recognizible moves such as the grapevine and the push-step.

The warm-up is very thorough and long but really prepares you for what's coming.  During the routine, they show the move at tempo, then slow it down a couple of times, then proceed to tempo again and gradually add on.  They repeat the moves many times before they do the whole routine with different members of their group.  That gives you plenty of time to nail it.  The cool-down follows and is as long as the warm-up and very effective.  Afterward, they show you recommended lower body toning techniques that demonstrate proper form but that you repeat on your own.

My favorite advantages of this video are the heartrate chart they show halfway through, the fact that they actually stop at some point in the workout to take a sip of water and encourage you to do the same and the fact that I get better at it each time I do it.

I love this video and highly recommend it to anybody who wants a little dance blast.",1270252800,,1642,4.51864406779661
7798266,5,1573306789,"I have had this tape before, but unfortunately I misplaced it when I moved to a different house, but one thing is for sure; if you are looking for something fun, exciting, and effective (if you put some effort into it), then this tape is for you! It is a great workout, from beginning to end. It starts with a warm-up, and goes right into a high-intensity fat burning workout, focusing primarily on the legs and mid-section, and it ends with a cool down. The moves are fun to watch and learn, and most important of all, they work! I highly recommend it!",1214524800,,553,4.378640776699029
7798267,4,1573306789,"I have been working out for about a month, and when I first started, this video was pretty challenging. (PS I'm trying to lose about 60 lbs.)After I had been working out for about 2-3 weeks, and I knew the dance steps pretty well, this video became a breeze. I like to use it on my ""I don't feel like working out today"" days, when I want a 'lite' workout. If you can get past the flirting, bad camera angles (not showing foot shots when they are demonstrating moves) and shameless self promotion (yeah, go scandal, work it!) I think this is a fun video with good workout music. When you know the dance moves and you don't want to slow your heart rate down when they are showing them to you, just march (or jog) in place. They have a great cool down, and even stop (once) to check your heart rate to make sure you're working as hard as you should. Four stars.",1062288000,4,858,4.206060606060606
7798268,5,1573306789,"I have had worked out with the video for about 5 years and I love it!  The steps were easy to learn.  Now, I do the warm-up, go straight to the routine, workout with the group, rewind and do routine again.  My heartrate reaches advanced level, I'm burning fat and toning at the same time.  This is my first Grind workout video and I am definitly purchasing another one.  It's so much more fun than regular aerobics.  I'm hooked!",1042156800,9,428,4.3544303797468356
