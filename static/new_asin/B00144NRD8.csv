8254385,3,B00144NRD8,"This video covers the Porsche Club of America race weekend at Sebring 2007.

It was fairly short, less than 30 minutes. The video contains mostly  short cuts of cars as they round corners. There is no comprehensive coverage of any particular race. The results are not presented.  There were very few talking heads.  There are no profiles on any of the cars or teams. One professional driver is interviewed for his take on driving the course, but it is very dry and does not demonstrate what he describes.  There are some neat shots of Porsche Cup cars lined  up on the starting grid.

It's a good video for a Porsche devotee or PCA member. Others will probably not be interested. If you were looking for coverage of the Sebring endurance race, this is not the tape.",1204243200,,765,4.580882352941177
