733428,4,6303934560,"Private Buckaroo is a wonderful wartime movie which I would reccomend to anyone who likes movies of the 1940's, and/or The Andrews Sisters.  I am also a Three Stooges fan, so I also liked seeing Shemp in it too.",941760000,2,211,4.410256410256411
733583,5,6303934560,This is typical of the films turned out during WWII as diversions for moviegoers who needed relief from their wartime lives.  The Andrew Sisters and Harry James (and his orchestra) were at the top of the pop charts and this 'mindless' entertainment features several of their top hits and some fine 'jitterbug' dancing.  Dick Foran (also from Broadway) warbles as the love interest and Shemp Howard (of Three Stooges fame) and the always very funny Mary Wickes provide many of the laughs.  Nostalgic.,1359417600,,499,4.9879518072289155
733584,5,6303934560,"I originally purchased this movie because I was looking for something that featured one of my favorite character actresses, Mary Wickes.  I ended up getting much more than I bargained for.  From the very first scene featuring the Andrews Sisters, to the patriotic ending with the fighter planes spelling USA in the air, this film will certainly keep you entertained.  True, the story line is a little weak and the scene with the spy traps in the field seems totally out of place, but the quality of the music more than makes up for these shortcomings.  The numbers featuring Harry James are simply outstanding, especially when Helen Forest is featured.  I can't say enough good things about the Andrews Sisters.  In addition to being very pretty and extremely good singers, their dancing and comedy numbers literally take my breath away.  Joe Lewis and Shemp Howard are spot on with their comedy timings and the dance number featuring the Jivin' Jacks and Jills is great.  Those kids could really dance, and they looked like they were having so much fun.  I would really like to see more of them.  I'll have to do some research to see if there are any other films available featuring them.  My only minor criticism of the film is with the choice of Dick Foran to play Lon Prentiss.  In my opinion, Frank Sinatra would have been much better playing that part.

I would like to point out that it was very uplifting to see Donald O'Connor and another young actor (don't know his name) as a couple of teenagers lying about their age in order to enlist in the army.  I had heard that this was common in the 40's.  However, when I was growing up in the 60's, most people lied about their age in order to avoid going into the military.

In short, this is a very entertaining look at a very different time in our country's history.  If you can overlook the obvious weak points and just enjoy the music and dancing, this movie will prove to be well worth the price.",1358640000,,1956,4.542857142857143
733585,4,6303934560,"An easily dismissible period piece, this musical-comedic-patriotic revue recalls many of the early Gershwin and Rodgers&Hart shows, for which the ""story-line,"" or what there was of it, was no more than an excuse for a lot of great songs.  To the songs, add the dance routines, the comedy schtick, the uneven acting, the comedy routines (with no small percentage of groaners), and the numerous patriotic numbers with lots of uniforms, parades, marching and guns (for display purposes).

The male romantic lead is a Nelson Eddy look-a-like/sound-a-like who seems ill cast as a jazz or swing singer (he has the title song not to mention a country-western number that manages to avoid the least hint of anything sounding remotely like country or western).

The Andrews Sisters light up the screen with each of their song and dance numbers, the highlights being ""Six Jerks in a Jeep"" and ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"" (great dancing by Maxine).

Harry James is at once the nadir and the zenith of the entertainment, first performing his pop hit, the schmaltzy, smarmy, tiresome ""You Made Me Love You,"" but soon making amends with a pyrotechnical trumpet toccata that's more Raphael Mendez than swing (but Harry blows with twice the volume--and without sacrificing technique and precision--as Mendez).  Some of today's musicians understandably dismiss James after hearing ""You Made Me Love You"" and some of his other hits--but to hear him for any extended period is to encounter one of the truly great trumpet players of the first half of the twentieth century (sadly, the same is true of the extraordinary trumpet work of the father of jazz, Louis Armstrong, who is too frequently judged solely on the basis of late trivia (""Hello, Dolly,"" Blueberry Hill,"" ""What a Wonderful World"").

As for the comedy routines, forget about them (you won't even have to try).  At best, they're a tolerable diversion if you're a fan of Shemp from The Three Stooges (my beef against the film's comedy is that the talents of Huntz Hall (Satch from The Bowery Boys and Eastside Kids) are completely allowed to go to waste.

It's good to see this one back in print and at a reasonable price (though don't expect anything like a sharp master print).  On the whole, the film captures the patriotic, community ""spirit"" that these days is not only sorely missed but seems irreclaimable (I'm afraid that wars against Iraq and immigrants have slim chance of bringing it back.)",1280361600,,2448,4.951219512195122
733586,4,6303934560,I received the item in a timely manner and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be.  I would continue to make purchases from this vendor.,1257465600,,141,4.035714285714286
733587,5,6303934560,"... the same blend as in a Rossini or Mozart opera or in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night. Though the corn seems cornier with age, the glamour is unfaded. Swing was America's finest-ever pop music, swing dance and swing-era clothes were truly glamourous, and the cinematography of this war-time morale booster was silky smooth. The story line -- band leader Harry James gets drafted and the whole band follows him to boot camp and to deployment ""over there"" -- is just a coat rack for the song-and-dance, featuring the genuine musical brilliance of the Andrews Sisters, including their classic ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"". The grand finale is an unabashed appeal to patriotism -- it was 1942, I was just over a year old, the war was no joke and patriotism was not anyone's idea of corn -- with the band marching forth to join thousands of staunch young men, thousands of warships, a sky full of fighter planes. If all that fervor wasn't real, you could have fooled me.

Do you want to know how America wanted to see itself in 1942? This film is it. Fun-loving, wise-cracking, irreverent towards authority but ready for the call of duty. Nobody's patsy. Never likely to fail a buddy. The iconic cowboy frontiersman, Private Buckaroo. Self-reliant but ready to share a load. Was the self-image realistic? That wasn't in question in the minds of the film makers. I know that my own mother  and her sisters idolized the Andrews Sisters. They dressed like them and slung their shoulders like them. My mother even looked like LaVerne and took voice lessons. My father, on the other hand, worshiped Charles Lindbergh and thought America was entering the war on the wrong side.

Buckaroo was a confidently White America. There's not a dusky complexion to be seen in the large cast of this film; the closest to an acknowledgement of ""another"" America is an allusion to ""Gone With the Wind"" and a scene where the crooner with the Harry James Orchestra sings a ""spiritual."" What, ""swing"" has jazz roots? Harry James is a knock-off of King Oliver and Louis Armstrong? America in 1942 was, and wanted to stay, blithely ignorant of that ""other"" America. The absence of ""dark laughter"" in Private Buckaroo is incontrovertible evidence of the rigid, brittle racism that the North had accommodated in order to preserve the Union and pass the New Deal.

But the glamour was real. The painterly camera work in black-and-white, grainy as it was, was artful. The comedy was clever and multi-leveled. The Andrew Sisters could SING! And the country could unite to confront a crisis. Where has it all gone, that youthful confidence and creativity?",1251590400,7,2625,4.865771812080537
733588,5,6303934560,"Knowing full well that this film was created to cash in on the popularity of Harry James & His Orchestra, and The Andrews Sisters, this is a cute programmer that i enjoyed very much.
Also, knowing that many films become 'emminent domain' after a period of years when nobody has the good sense to re-register it's copyright, this film has now been released by whatever company has an actual print of it.
Despite it's B- quality, as it is a rather worn print, I didn't expect anything more than a good picture with a so-so story, scratchy film, but with legends from the 1940's to make it all work.
In all, i was charmed, and entertained.",1247097600,,636,4.491379310344827
733589,5,6303934560,"This is a great way to get a feel for what the times must have been like during WWII...everyone wanted to get into the army and everyone danced to the big band sounds...(I have a personal pride in this movie, my Dad was Harry James' drummer at the time!).

733592,2,6303934560,"I saw this movie a number of years ago on a show called ""Matinee at the Bijou"" on public television.  A movie typical of it's time with rah-rah USA let's all join the war effort as its only real plot point.  This was a chance to trot out stars whether they could act or not just to boost morale and recruting.  This stars Harry James and his orchestra, the Andrews Sisters, Joe E. Lewis and Dick Foran.  The concept was silly:  Harry gets drafted so the whole band joins.  It was fun to see the Andrews Sisters do several numbers including, of course, ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree.""  The bits between Joe E. Lewis and Shemp Howard were sort of amusing even though I've never been a big fan.  Holy cow, who ever knew Mary Wickes was young at one time?!  When they aren't singing or playing, the rest of the movie is about a singer who decides he doesn't need to do his duty like the rest of his unit.  He later comes to realize (there's a girl involved and the ire of his buddies)everybody needs to do their part in the war effort.  The end.  It's a quaint slice of 1940s history period.  Look for young Donald O'Connor and his teenage dance partner, Peggy Ryan in a few scenes.",1221782400,,1180,4.261261261261262
733702,2,6303934560,"I purchased this video because it contains performances by the Andrews Sisters.  The movie itself is waaaay beyond lame, having been filmed during World War II.

733704,4,6303934560,"I purchased this to replace a failing VHS copy. That it had Harry James and the Andrew Sisters was the draw. It is as corny as it gets. If you love the images of the 40's big band era, the look and the talk, you'll not mind. The dance scene toward the end was quite naughty for the time. At least the girls' underpants were full coverage back then.
This movie was made for the young people of the time, to entertain them into the spirit of the war effort. Oh! By the way, there is Shemp Howard for ""Stooges"" fans. This movie has no great deeps. Cheap laughs, great music and dancing kids were all that were originally offered. Music plus visual images. It doesn't cost enough for you to agonize over the price.

I liked this film because I'm a big fan of the Andrews Sisters and this has long been considered their best film. It's hard to find, so I was glad to get it - if worried about the manufacturing problems. That's why I have to say I was pleasantly delighted with what I got.

The songs are the highlight of the film.",1153094400,,466,4.1098901098901095
733707,5,6303934560,"""`Private Buckaroo' is a real treat - something like M.A.S.H. meets Fiddler on the Roof. If it's also unusual, it's because it was pertinent to the issues of a period that we may not be familiar with. I loved the bittersweet treatment of the draft, and the satirized Army camp atmosphere.

733708,5,6303934560,"As a collector of classic musicals this was a ""must have"" DVD for me. Filmed just after the start of the second world war, the filme is part propoganda, part musical and all fun.

The Andrew's Sisters are as cute and charming as ever and they make you want to sing along. I was impressed by the quality of the film - the sound was a lot clearer than that of other DVDs I've ordered from this era.

Of all the Andrew Sisters films I like this one the best.",1146441600,,455,4.044444444444444
733709,1,6303934560,"This is essentially an armed forces recruitment film made by Universal shortly after the U.S. formal entry into World War II, utilizing some comics and swing musicians to raise the patriotic tenor. The wispy plot relates how the entire band of Harry James decides to enlist in the Army to follow its drafted leader, with a subsequent U.S.O. follies being organized directly before the entire group marches avidly into combat. With the exception of the reliable Mary Wickes, the comedians, in particular Joe E. Lewis and Shemp Howard, are dreadful and serve only to make the various musical interludes, notably those featuring the sprightly Andrews Sisters, a welcome relief --- from comedy. Former big band singer Dick Foran, who warbles the title tune, is the featured non-musical performer tasked to deal with the hapless propagandistic script, but 16 year old Donald O'Connor nearly steals the show along with some of his jitterbugging cronies.",1119657600,3,947,5.196078431372549
733710,4,6303934560,"With the benefit of the DVD format, this film can be enjoyed as an Andrews Sisters concert with Harry James as well as the 1942 low-budget Universal musical that it was at the time of release  (and a box office success, by the way).
The Sisters swing on ""Three Little Sisters"" (note this is after the disaster at Bataan/Corregidor and the lyric ""from Iceland to the Philippines"" is changed to ""from Iceland down to New Orleans""), ""That's the Moon, My Son"" and ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"".  This is a rare chance to hear the great Vic Schoen Andrews Sisters arrangements with the sharp James orchestra. This film also provides a glimpse of the great stage presence and commedienne quality of Patty Andrews, if only briefly.
Harry James and Helen Forrest join forces for ""You Made Me Love You"" and ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen"".
James demonstrates his considerable talent on the trumpet several times and the Sisters keep smiling through, perhaps, their strangest novelty song, ""We're Six Jerks in a Jeep"".
Dick Foran croons ""Private Buckaroo"" and gives out with ""We've Got a Job to Do"" which is also the Andrews Sisters finale after the equally rare ""Johnny Get Your Gun Again"".  Neither of these two wartime tunes were recorded by the Sisters in the Decca studio and may only exist in the Sisters surviving recordings on this film soundtrack.
Then-former Stooge Shemp Howard, Mary Wickes and the dancing team of Peggy Ryan and Donald O'Conner try to provide comic support in the tradition of musical comedy films of the era.  This DVD contains an adequate print of the film with good sound and also has some World War II newsreel footage and movie bloopers in the package unrelated to ""Private Buckaroo"".
If Universal does not release a restored print of this film or an Andrews Sisters Universal DVD multi-film package (oh, that they would!), this is a keepsake item.",1078099200,32,1880,4.811145510835913
