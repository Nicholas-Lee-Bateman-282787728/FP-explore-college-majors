8141480,4,B000HT3POW,"Here we are hopelessly in love with The War Of The Roses, unable to find this film available in Australia,looking on & off since release of the film. This release[9(ASIN:B000HT3POW Love Is War Box Set (Mr. & Mrs. Smith / Down with Love / The War of the Roses))]; deserving of your American Thanksgiving, due to the one turkey of the box set,one in particular is a stand out release.....does not feature Angie & Brad; Kathleen & Michael,stand out performances, due to that one remaining bastion..""love"". Don't tell anyone,(we already know). What makes the union of the male & female species specific? Expectation that we are forgiving,deliberate in the action of giving of ourselves... come hell or high water, this screenplay divides the waters. We all drown. Now, to the once upon a time there was a happy marriage due to the fact that wife & hubby kept their nose out of one another's business. Mr & Mrs Smith. All that's missing is the picket fence; Kill Bill, Matrix, Terminator, it ain't. Still entertaining in its' own way, this pitting of man against woman,(the box office is against this),although the absence of a robot does not preclude the performances at times. Angelina would have given Terminator 3, that little bit extra. Fifteen minutes wasted in Down With Love, however may be coaxed into viewing this little gem, upon hell freezing over.",1345248000,,1355,4.87012987012987
