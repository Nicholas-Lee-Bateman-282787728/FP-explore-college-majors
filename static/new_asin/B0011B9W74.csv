These few meet together in a small, secret group and give themselves electrical highs. --- SOCKET then becomes the horror clich story of a Strange Thing (blood, brain parts, salt, lifeforce, etc.) That Becomes An Addiction and ends with another clich, The Horror Still Lives! --- (The Strange Addiction theme can be done with greatness: watch Roger Corman's X - THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES.) --- This is a well-done movie even with a low-budget that had to be filmed in 9 days. Many of the actors are excellent; one reason I bought this DVD was for Matthew Montgomery, who I've followed since his appearance in a fan-made STAR TREK web episode. --- The main reason I bought it is I *really* love SF&F&H and if it's gay-related that's a *big* plus. --- Beyond its standard plot, there are several serious problems that make enjoying SOCKET difficult.  First, the movie's transfer to DVD seems to have been done at a low audio level.  Once the film began I had to turn my TV's volume to nearly twice it's normal level to make it audible.  (After the end credits, I was blasted by loud music when the disc returned to the menu.) --- Next, of great importance in all speculative film/fiction is to have a consistent universe *within* its story. SOCKET fails this in two ways.  There is the often presence of TVs with static-filled screens. I had thought the electrically-charged character's body interfered with electronics, but this was contradicted by his using a cell phone and computer without problems. In the commentary, you learn the director *forgot* to film the explanation for the TVs, but even if this had been used, it's still not consistent in the movie. --- (The commentary is badly-made; some people on it can barely be heard and at one point there is an unexplained silence for 3 minutes.) --- Another internal universe concept in SOCKET is obsessive-compulsive neatness developes in these lightning-struck individuals.  This is explained as ""Energy is order.""  Scientifically that's wrong; energy is imbalance and chaos.  (Re: E=MC2 & entropy & opening-credits' lightning.) This then contradicts many events, resulting in my often being ""taken-out of the movie"". --- Finally, one of the *worst* distractions was during the characters' ""power-ups"".  I am 96% sure the sound used during these was of the original STAR TREK's ""Enterprise"" increasing its warp speed! --- It was very pleasarable to watch a movie where the central characters were gay men and this wasn't vital to the story; the same with the occasional nudity.  However I was disturbed by what I felt was a rape of one man by the other, without any follow-up to this. --- I feel the reason I've been so critical in this review goes back to my original comment: SOCKET is a good SF horror film that could have been a great one.  I suggest SOCKET as a should-see, and for gay SF&F&H fans, a must-buy. Just know you might be disappointed at times.

3064112,5,B0011B9W74,"Tired of AIDS, coming of age, that first relationship, and campy fabulousness being the only subjects of queer cinema? Ready for a gay film where the sexual orientation of the characters is treated in a matter-of-fact manner and secondary to the actual storytelling? Do you like good ole fashioned sci-fi/horror genre entertainment? Then Socket is a movie you'll want to check out.

I managed to catch this at the LA G&L film festival last year, and I have to say it was a breath of fresh year. I'm gay, but I'm also a true blue geek who loves good sci-fi and horror movies. And let's face it, it's not like anyone is trampling over themselves to make movies for gay geeks. So to discover Socket, with it's quirky premise, solid writing, and great performances, that just also happened to have some super steamy sex scenes thrown in, was truly a nice surprise. I'm glad to see that the film secured a distributor so that more people will be able to see it - and I hope that it's a big success so that more movies like it will get made in the future.",1205798400,41,1049,4.435233160621761
3064113,1,B0011B9W74,"What a horrible, horrble movie! I've given it one star, but it really deserves none.

Throw in some REALLY bad science fiction elements; some questionable pyscho-babble; some horrible acting and writing; some gratuitous nudity and sex scenes, mix it all together and this movie is what you'd come up with.

It is shocking (pardon the pun) that some of the stupid elements of this film were even committed to film.

Spoiler: The electrical outlets in the arms of the participants has to be the most laughable thing I have seen in recent years... heck, this element of the film might have been passe in the 1950s, but today's audience certainly deserves better.

I sat through the entire movie looking at my watch praying it would end. All I can say is do NOT buy this film... The only electrifying thing about this film is that it was ever made. I cannot even suggest renting it unless you want to laugh your head off wondering why people would do such stupid things as the characters in this movie do.

I'd rather stick my finger in an electrical socket then watch or recommend this movie. Avoid it all costs as it really stinks!",1205020800,27,1129,4.597014925373134

3064117,2,B0011B9W74,"Socket (Sean Abley, 2007)

A while back, I reviewed a ridiculous, but quite amusing, little movie called The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror. While I was doing the research on that one, I happened upon Socket; so many personnel cross over between the two films that it almost seems as if this was one of those Roger Corman-esque situations where they wrapped one film early, realized they had time on their hands and extra film stock, and said hey, who's got a script they want to film? If I'm right on that, this was the movie they set out to make, and ...Bed and Breakfast... was the afterthought; every place that movie is silly, stupid fun, Socket is serious as an electrocution burn. The unfortunate side effect of this is that where ...Bed and Breakfast... escaped its basement budget relatively unharmedin fact, connoisseurs of bad slasher movies almost expect movies to have zero budget going into themSocket is a movie that could have really, really used a budget boost in order to get the most out of its ideas. None of the movie's problems on its own is a showstopper, but they do add up.

Plot: Bill Matthews (Make the Yuletide Gay's Derek Long), a prominent surgeon at a metropolitan hospital, is struck by lightning, and finds himself a patient at his own workplace. Time goes by, and much of his physical trauma heals, but he still feels shaken, rootless, at a loss. A fellow doctor at the hospital, Craig Murphy (Gone, but Not Forgotten's Matthew Montgomery), takes an interest that is, perhaps, more than professional; not only do the two of them begin an intimate relationship, but Murphy introduces Matthews to what he initially bills as a support group for lightning-strike survivors. Bill soon finds that it is much, much more than thatand that the best way to combat his lingering malaise is with erotic jolts of electricity. But in Bill's world, electricity, like sex, can become dangerously all-consuming.

There was a lot about Socket that I liked, in some cases despite myself. I know the best-lesbian-friends-of-the-gay-main-character trope is overdone and kind of tired, but that didn't stop me loving Allie Rivenbark (one of the many minor cast members who also showed up in ...Bed and Breakfast...) and Rasool J'Han (The Bay)'s characters here. Georgia Jean, while her role here was depressingly small, validated my initial impression in ...Bed and Breakfast... that there's a lot to like about her acting ability; unfortunately, these are her only two feature appearances to date. (Please, someone, fix that.) And man, the script is absolutely bursting with excellent ideas; I've seen reviews compare it to both David Cronenberg (the obvious parallel is Videodrome) and The Picture of Dorian Gray, and both of those comparisons are right on the money. In a sense, Socket is kind of the anti-Daydreamer (above); Socket has all the pieces that were missing from Daydreamer and vice-versa. Too bad these two kids didn't get together and have a perfect, twisted love child. I can't overlook Socket's shortcomings, its woeful special effects, its penchant for taking itself too seriously in places where it begs for camp, its ultimately unsatisfying ending. But I'm still going to conditionally recommend it because there is so much to like sitting just underneath the hood. If you're the kind of person who can appreciate awful third-generation bootleg tapes of your favorite band because you can listen to them and imagine what the music actually sounded like at that gig, then Socket should be right up your alley. **",1385510400,,3546,4.966329966329966

Dr. Matthews soon discovers that electricity is addictive and begins his journey into hell. Socket is an excellent offering of Science Fiction from Gay filmmakers, where sex is not the focus.

3064126,1,B0011B9W74,"Ummm... Yeah... One can imagine getting off with electricity... In Fact, If I rememeber correctly, I think it HAS been done... One can also hypothesize about the ideals set in this film, in that, the storyline, & concepts. I expected a HELL of a lot more, but was story was an absolute jumble, & a complete joke.

While the character referencing was brilliant, and each persona has their own lifestyle, I think thats all the movie remains. While it seems that they are all somehow connected (ignoring the obvious innuendo), they remain out of touch with one another so terribly, that it leaves the viewer wondering ""What the...?!""...

I don't think this film works, for what its worth... It could have been done a LOT better, But thats just the folly of it all... I mean, Come On... Sticking forks into sockets & Getting off???! Sounds just as bad as the current fad of ""Planking"" seeping accross the world...

3064127,4,B0011B9W74,"Very interesting premise for a film.  The two main characters are very nice to look at, as far as I'm concerned. The film isn't Academy Award material by any means, but it is great for a bowl of popcorn and put your feet up on the coffee table and relax evening.  The lighting could be a LOT better, but all in all, it's enjoyable.",1267488000,3,331,4.15625
3064128,2,B0011B9W74,"Hats off to the folks behind ""Socket"", who aim to create a whole new genre of film: gay-science fiction.  In comparison to other gay-blenderized themes (such as gay-horror in ""Hellbent"") they succeed pretty admirably.  The shoestring budget that this film was made on is obvious, but not painfully so for a change, and the premise is really intriguing.

The story goes like this: at some point before the opening credits, surgeon Bill Matthews (Derek Long) has been struck by lightning.  While recuperating in the hospital where he also happens to work, he is tended to by hottie intern Craig Murphy (gay indie favorite Matthew Montgomery), who has the hots back for the Bill.  Post-discharge (pun intended), Murphy introduces Bill to a secretive support group of lightning strike survivors, all of whom have found a physical - and sexual - attraction to electricity.  Together they have twelve-step-style meetings which lead up to the group getting ""juiced up"" in unison.  Bill quickly falls into the new lifestyle, but before too long a periodic jolt becomes insufficient; his thirst for each charge becomes more insatiable, leading him to a bizarre bit of self-mutilation... and worse.

Sure, the idea is kind of silly... but this isn't the first time something like this has been tried.  In 1996, David Cronenberg tried to connect fetishism to automobile accidents in ""Crash"" (no, not the Best Picture winner of 2005.)  It didn't really work there... ""Socket"" has better luck conveying the idea.

The film's biggest strength lies in the very clear allegory it creates in reference to drug abuse.  What is first an incredible release for Bill - and a means to connect with others - quickly dissolves into something controlling and destructive.  And although Derek Long's performance is obvious to the point that it's blunt, it doesn't keep this aspect of the film from succeeding nicely.

So why the two stars and no more?  Because, after all the great set-up work, ""Socket"" completely fails to deliver the jolt (pun intended again) it promises.  The last quarter of the film is disappointingly lackluster, and the ending is so flat it almost makes you wonder if they inadvertently chopped off a final scene.  There was a great opportunity to take the electricity/drug analogy to a wild and transcendental ending... instead we get something bleak and boring.  Downcast is one thing... unsatisfying is another.",1251244800,,2412,5.0786802030456855
3064129,2,B0011B9W74,This movie was so bad it was good...I loved it! I could not stop laughing at everything about it. The actors weren't so bad but the story was so lame. It's worth renting just to see exactly how bad gay movies can be. A major swing and miss. Should have been called SuckIt but then everyone would assume it was porn.,1248566400,2,315,4.180327868852459
3064130,3,B0011B9W74,"I have to admit after reading the reviews I waited until this movie went on sale to purchase it. I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed this movie. The two leads, Bill and Craig (Matthew Montgomery from ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"") had great chemistry together and the plot was extremely original.

Now I have seen better production values on a Sci-Fi channel Saturday night movie, but for a low-budget, sci-fi and gay-themed film this movie is far better than say ""Boa vs. Python"" or ""Megasnake.""

Take a chance on this film, I think you'll like it.",1244937600,2,595,4.766990291262136
3064131,1,B0011B9W74,"This is a typical film that is more about getting something on tape than it is about telling a story well.

Perhaps if there were a local arts council to provide adequate funding this film could have hired the talent it needed to execute on the concept. The writer needed external folks to fill roles he filled himself.

It comes off as exactly what it was - a film produced on a budget reserved for a concept not an entire work. By stretching the funds this tight the film remains in the bin of ""if only.... ""

3064137,3,B0011B9W74,"An interesting allegorical film on addiction, ""Socket"" is a sexy, dark, and perversely funny gay science fiction flick. After a lightning accident, Dr. Bill Matthews (Derek Long) receives an invitation from an intern, Craig (Matthew Montgomery,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-But-Not-Forgotten/dp/B000BQ7J98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone But Not Forgotten</a>). Turns out that Craig, like Dr. Matthews, is a survivor of a lightning bolt and he has friends with similar stories. What they also share, in a weird reversal of 12-step support groups, is a secret addiction. After that first taste, they all want more, and group leader Mike (writer/director Sean Abbey) has the generator to provide it.

Soon, Dr Matthews finds that he not only feels community with the juicers, but he needs more to function in his daily life. He brings the group new methods of more direct ""connections,"" so to speak, and falls into a relationship with his intern. But like all too many addicts, Dr Matthews soon discovers that he needs even more than the group can give him, and tragically discovers the only way he can get the full dose he needs. The spiral of addiction fuels ""Socket,"" and Dr Matthews' new double life adds to the tension.

The premise is interesting and the actors do a pretty good job of conveying the confusing world of professional level addicts. Dr. Matthews battles with the reality of his addiction and the facade he needs to maintain at work, sneaking off to ""plug in"" and hoping nobody discovers how deep he's gone. Long does a good job at this split personality, and Montgomery's turn as at first the guide and then the spurned to the group is ""Socket's"" best performance.

Even though it's not the best movie of any of the genres it crosses, it certainly is not ""the worst gay movie ever"", as touted in the hyperbolic reviews which trash it.  SOCKET has a unique premise and carries it out well.  Without over-analyzing the physics or having a degree in engineering, I was able to sit back and enjoy a fun ride with likable characters and a light presentation. I was a little disappointed because, I don't know why, I expected more gore.  I guess when I learned of the concept of the movie, I thought it sounded very David Cronenberg... so I imagined there'd be more gore.  One of the positive aspects of the movie is that it is a movie with gay characters that isn't about being gay.  I think it has cross-over appeal for a hetero audience not afraid of seeing men naked as much as we see Sharon Stone naked in her ""thrillers"".  Also, the nudity isn't as gratuitous as other reviwews here would have you believe.  This isn't one of those movies that's all about sex & naked gays with a loose story hung around it.  Here, the story and characters come first.  I think the problem other reviewers had with this movie was a preconcieved notion of what they were going to see.  I was disappointed with the lack of gore when I was expecting buckets, but I realize it wasn't the movie makers' fault I expected that without knowing the movie well before seeing it.  I guess the movie is at least unique in the fact that its premise has a lot of possibilities-  I think it is worth a look with an open mind and few preconcieved notions.",1208908800,19,1578,4.384879725085911

In the commentary, you learn the director *forgot* to film the explanation for the TVs, but even if this had been used, it's still not consistent in the movie. --- (The commentary is badly-made; some people on it can barely be heard and at one point there is an unexplained silence for 3 minutes.) --- Another internal universe concept in SOCKET is obsessive-compulsive neatness developes in these lightning-struck individuals.  This is explained as ""Energy is order.""  Scientifically that's wrong; energy is imbalance and chaos.  (Re: E=MC2 & entropy & opening-credits' lightning.) This then contradicts many events, resulting in my often being ""taken-out of the movie"". --- Finally, one of the *worst* distractions was during the characters' ""power-ups"".  I am 96% sure the sound used during these was of the original STAR TREK's ""Enterprise"" increasing its warp speed! --- It was very pleasarable to watch a movie where the central characters were gay men and this wasn't vital to the story; the same with the occasional nudity.  However I was disturbed by what I felt was a rape of one man by the other, without any follow-up to this. --- I feel the reason I've been so critical in this review goes back to my original comment: SOCKET is a good SF horror film that could have been a great one.  I suggest SOCKET as a should-see, and for gay SF&F&H fans, a must-buy. Just know you might be disappointed at times.

Ready for a gay film where the sexual orientation of the characters is treated in a matter-of-fact manner and secondary to the actual storytelling?

I managed to catch this at the LA G&L film festival last year, and I have to say it was a breath of fresh year. I'm gay, but I'm also a true blue geek who loves good sci-fi and horror movies. And let's face it, it's not like anyone is trampling over themselves to make movies for gay geeks. So to discover Socket, with it's quirky premise, solid writing, and great performances, that just also happened to have some super steamy sex scenes thrown in, was truly a nice surprise.

It is shocking (pardon the pun) that some of the stupid elements of this film were even committed to film.

Spoiler: The electrical outlets in the arms of the participants has to be the most laughable thing I have seen in recent years... heck, this element of the film might have been passe in the 1950s, but today's audience certainly deserves better.

I sat through the entire movie looking at my watch praying it would end. All I can say is do NOT buy this film... The only electrifying thing about this film is that it was ever made. I cannot even suggest renting it unless you want to laugh your head off wondering why people would do such stupid things as the characters in this movie do.

3298614,2,B0011B9W74,"Socket (Sean Abley, 2007)

A while back, I reviewed a ridiculous, but quite amusing, little movie called The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror. While I was doing the research on that one, I happened upon Socket; so many personnel cross over between the two films that it almost seems as if this was one of those Roger Corman-esque situations where they wrapped one film early, realized they had time on their hands and extra film stock, and said hey, who's got a script they want to film? If I'm right on that, this was the movie they set out to make, and ...Bed and Breakfast... was the afterthought; every place that movie is silly, stupid fun, Socket is serious as an electrocution burn. The unfortunate side effect of this is that where ...Bed and Breakfast... escaped its basement budget relatively unharmedin fact, connoisseurs of bad slasher movies almost expect movies to have zero budget going into themSocket is a movie that could have really, really used a budget boost in order to get the most out of its ideas. None of the movie's problems on its own is a showstopper, but they do add up.

Plot: Bill Matthews (Make the Yuletide Gay's Derek Long), a prominent surgeon at a metropolitan hospital, is struck by lightning, and finds himself a patient at his own workplace. Time goes by, and much of his physical trauma heals, but he still feels shaken, rootless, at a loss. A fellow doctor at the hospital, Craig Murphy (Gone, but Not Forgotten's Matthew Montgomery), takes an interest that is, perhaps, more than professional; not only do the two of them begin an intimate relationship, but Murphy introduces Matthews to what he initially bills as a support group for lightning-strike survivors. Bill soon finds that it is much, much more than thatand that the best way to combat his lingering malaise is with erotic jolts of electricity. But in Bill's world, electricity, like sex, can become dangerously all-consuming.

There was a lot about Socket that I liked, in some cases despite myself. I know the best-lesbian-friends-of-the-gay-main-character trope is overdone and kind of tired, but that didn't stop me loving Allie Rivenbark (one of the many minor cast members who also showed up in ...Bed and Breakfast...) and Rasool J'Han (The Bay)'s characters here. Georgia Jean, while her role here was depressingly small, validated my initial impression in ...Bed and Breakfast... that there's a lot to like about her acting ability; unfortunately, these are her only two feature appearances to date. (Please, someone, fix that.) And man, the script is absolutely bursting with excellent ideas; I've seen reviews compare it to both David Cronenberg (the obvious parallel is Videodrome) and The Picture of Dorian Gray, and both of those comparisons are right on the money. In a sense, Socket is kind of the anti-Daydreamer (above); Socket has all the pieces that were missing from Daydreamer and vice-versa. Too bad these two kids didn't get together and have a perfect, twisted love child. I can't overlook Socket's shortcomings, its woeful special effects, its penchant for taking itself too seriously in places where it begs for camp, its ultimately unsatisfying ending. But I'm still going to conditionally recommend it because there is so much to like sitting just underneath the hood. If you're the kind of person who can appreciate awful third-generation bootleg tapes of your favorite band because you can listen to them and imagine what the music actually sounded like at that gig, then Socket should be right up your alley. **",1385510400,,3546,4.966329966329966

3298625,2,B0011B9W74,"Hats off to the folks behind ""Socket"", who aim to create a whole new genre of film: gay-science fiction.  In comparison to other gay-blenderized themes (such as gay-horror in ""Hellbent"") they succeed pretty admirably.  The shoestring budget that this film was made on is obvious, but not painfully so for a change, and the premise is really intriguing.

The story goes like this: at some point before the opening credits, surgeon Bill Matthews (Derek Long) has been struck by lightning.  While recuperating in the hospital where he also happens to work, he is tended to by hottie intern Craig Murphy (gay indie favorite Matthew Montgomery), who has the hots back for the Bill.  Post-discharge (pun intended), Murphy introduces Bill to a secretive support group of lightning strike survivors, all of whom have found a physical - and sexual - attraction to electricity.  Together they have twelve-step-style meetings which lead up to the group getting ""juiced up"" in unison.  Bill quickly falls into the new lifestyle, but before too long a periodic jolt becomes insufficient; his thirst for each charge becomes more insatiable, leading him to a bizarre bit of self-mutilation... and worse.

Sure, the idea is kind of silly... but this isn't the first time something like this has been tried.  In 1996, David Cronenberg tried to connect fetishism to automobile accidents in ""Crash"" (no, not the Best Picture winner of 2005.)  It didn't really work there... ""Socket"" has better luck conveying the idea.

The film's biggest strength lies in the very clear allegory it creates in reference to drug abuse.  What is first an incredible release for Bill - and a means to connect with others - quickly dissolves into something controlling and destructive.  And although Derek Long's performance is obvious to the point that it's blunt, it doesn't keep this aspect of the film from succeeding nicely.

So why the two stars and no more?  Because, after all the great set-up work, ""Socket"" completely fails to deliver the jolt (pun intended again) it promises.  The last quarter of the film is disappointingly lackluster, and the ending is so flat it almost makes you wonder if they inadvertently chopped off a final scene.  There was a great opportunity to take the electricity/drug analogy to a wild and transcendental ending... instead we get something bleak and boring.  Downcast is one thing... unsatisfying is another.",1251244800,,2412,5.0786802030456855

Now I have seen better production values on a Sci-Fi channel Saturday night movie, but for a low-budget, sci-fi and gay-themed film this movie is far better than say ""Boa vs. Python"" or ""Megasnake.""

Turns out that Craig, like Dr. Matthews, is a survivor of a lightning bolt and he has friends with similar stories. What they also share, in a weird reversal of 12-step support groups, is a secret addiction. After that first taste, they all want more, and group leader Mike (writer/director Sean Abbey) has the generator to provide it.

Soon, Dr Matthews finds that he not only feels community with the juicers, but he needs more to function in his daily life. He brings the group new methods of more direct ""connections,"" so to speak, and falls into a relationship with his intern. But like all too many addicts, Dr Matthews soon discovers that he needs even more than the group can give him, and tragically discovers the only way he can get the full dose he needs. The spiral of addiction fuels ""Socket,"" and Dr Matthews' new double life adds to the tension.

The premise is interesting and the actors do a pretty good job of conveying the confusing world of professional level addicts. Dr. Matthews battles with the reality of his addiction and the facade he needs to maintain at work, sneaking off to ""plug in"" and hoping nobody discovers how deep he's gone. Long does a good job at this split personality, and Montgomery's turn as at first the guide and then the spurned to the group is ""Socket's"" best performance.

Even though it's not the best movie of any of the genres it crosses, it certainly is not ""the worst gay movie ever"", as touted in the hyperbolic reviews which trash it.  SOCKET has a unique premise and carries it out well.  Without over-analyzing the physics or having a degree in engineering, I was able to sit back and enjoy a fun ride with likable characters and a light presentation. I was a little disappointed because, I don't know why, I expected more gore.  I guess when I learned of the concept of the movie, I thought it sounded very David Cronenberg... so I imagined there'd be more gore.  One of the positive aspects of the movie is that it is a movie with gay characters that isn't about being gay.  I think it has cross-over appeal for a hetero audience not afraid of seeing men naked as much as we see Sharon Stone naked in her ""thrillers"".  Also, the nudity isn't as gratuitous as other reviwews here would have you believe.  This isn't one of those movies that's all about sex & naked gays with a loose story hung around it.  Here, the story and characters come first.  I think the problem other reviewers had with this movie was a preconcieved notion of what they were going to see.  I was disappointed with the lack of gore when I was expecting buckets, but I realize it wasn't the movie makers' fault I expected that without knowing the movie well before seeing it.
