8424579,1,B004CZZZFO,"I watched this movie, ""Flight of the Doves,"" many years ago and loved it.  When it came out on DVD, I was thrilled and ordered it as a Christmas gift for a friend.  However, my friend just told me that the DVD is defective and does not work at all, even though she tried it on different DVD players, including a multi-region DVD player.  When I looked up my order history, I found out that I cannot return the DVD to Amazon.com because the return deadline expired in January.  So my warning is DO NOT BUY this DVD or, if you do, try it out on a DVD player right away.",1395619200,3,567,4.081081081081081

Happy ending too! My family loved it and we started our vacationing in Ireland partly because of this movie.",1391472000,3,220,4.972972972972973
8424582,5,B004CZZZFO,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. The acting is superb and I love how the plot flits from being creepy to funny to sad to creepy again etc.  The quality of the DVD isn't perfect, but I think they did a good job all things considered. And the sometimes grainy screen is well worth it.",1359676800,,285,4.277777777777778
