6140182,5,B00H8B87ZE,"Angela's story is one of strength, courage, and overcoming adversity to find what every adopted adult longs for: closure.  This film is a groundbreaking resource for adoptive families to understand the emotional journey that adopted children will likely face.  While this film is an invaluable tool for educating prospective adoptive couples - and should be required for families even considering transracial adoption - the filmmaker (Angela's husband) has created a piece that transcends just the ""adoption community"" and looks at a bigger, more vastly relatable story, a human story that all people can appreciate.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is, or strives to be, awesome.",1386892800,4,690,5.37037037037037
6140183,5,B00H8B87ZE,"I'm an adoptive mom of 4 now young adults, and I worked professionally in the field of adoption and foster care. I found Closure to be a brilliant, insightful documentary. It tracks Angela's journey to her birth family through her eyes, as well as through those who love her. Search and reunion are complicated. Technology can speed things up these days, but the work of connecting is complicated. Closure provides a unique view into the complexity, the challenge, the joy, the grief, the laughter. It's a must-see for anyone who works in adoption and foster care, for adoptive parents, for adoptees, for first parents--for anyone with a family.",1386806400,2,645,4.981481481481482
6140184,5,B00H8B87ZE,"As an adoptive mom my original goal in watching this video was preparing for when my young daughter will someday have questions about her birth family. This documentary gave me so much more.  Theresa's (Angela's adopted mom) grace, selflessness and generosity are inspiring in the grounded feedback she gives Angela as she accompanies and supports her in her quest to meet her birth family. Angela's birthmother's struggles in the process of reconnection are so clearly revealed by the filmmaker...a situation with so many layers yet uncomplicated in the way the story unfolds.  Angela's story is one that can help people inside and outside of the world of adoption understand a little about the joys and complexities and importance of integration of birth and adoptive families for a more unified sense of self for everyone involved.",1386806400,2,834,5.17037037037037
6140185,5,B00H8B87ZE,"Excellent documentary! Very well done and a MUST SEE for all members of the adoption triad (birth parents, adoptive parents, and adoptee).",1386806400,2,138,5.318181818181818
6140186,5,B00H8B87ZE,"Awesome awesome awesome movie!!! Defiantly a must see, heart felt and very emotional documentary, lots of ups & downs but in the end it's all good!",1386806400,2,147,4.6923076923076925
6140187,5,B00H8B87ZE,"Having only experienced adoption through friends who have adopted, I watched this documentary for purely ""supportive"" reasons. ..however, I walked away deeply moved and with a new understanding of the depth and span of emotions that embody the journey of adoption from so many different perspectives.
You fall in love with the journey, the grief, and the healing...in all of its complexity. ...And you walk away wishing you were BFFs with Angela and her husband!
Well done!",1386806400,2,473,5.1558441558441555
6140188,5,B00H8B87ZE,"I've seen Closure twice and both times it made me cry. I don't tend to cry in public, but it's that well done and that touching. As a member of the adoption community, as a social worker, as a relinquishing mom, as an adoption researcher, as a doctoral student I firmly believe EVERYONE adoption connected or not should see this film.",1386806400,2,334,4.491803278688525
6140189,5,B00H8B87ZE,"A lot of the resources we had to purchase for our adoption training was useless and some just down right awful. With that being said, My husband and I actually really enjoyed watching this and found it extremely insightful. It's wonderful that this young lady chose to share her adoption story and how it has impacted her life as well as taking both sides of the family into account. I would recommend this!",1481673600,,407,4.589041095890411

6140192,5,B00H8B87ZE,"Thought this was incredibly well done.  Covered just enough of so many feelings of so many family members over time, the varied challenges that were faced, and how love and grace go a long way to allowing healing to happen. His editing skills are amazing. It is hard to believe so much was packed so skillfully into the time given. First seen on PBS ..so happy to have my own copy now to share with friends and family.",1439078400,,418,4.358974358974359
6140193,5,B00H8B87ZE,"My own personal experiences as a transracial adoptee growing up propelled me to check out this Closure documentary about a woman named Angela Tucker. Angela Tucker is an African American female who was raised by a Caucasian family in Washington. The documentary shows that there is very much a lot of love between Angela and her adoptive parents. Angelas husband is also interviewed in the documentary and he is shown being very much supportive of her wanting to find her birth parents. Angela successfully finds her birth father Oterus. Fortunately Oterus accepts her into his life and he willingly agrees to have a dna test. It is confirmed (through the dna test)that Oterus is in fact Angelas biological father. Angelas journey to finding her biological mother gets offs to a rocky start, I want to say more on what happens between Angela and her mother but must avoid doing so for people seeing this review who want to see the documentary. I was curious to check out this Closure documentary after unintentionally seeing Angelas story as a trans-racial adoptee featured in an Huffington post article. I was also curious to understand my own journey as Angela bravely tells her own journey because of coming from a transracial family myself (my late adoptive mother was Caucasian French and Cherokee Indian while my adoptive father is Mexican and Aztec Indian). I know for sure that I inherited my Puerto-Rican and Menominee Indian ancestry from my late biological mother (both my late biological mother and maternal grandmother are listed to be on the Menominee Indian tribal rolls in Wisconsin). However, I must admit Im extremely grateful that I was adopted but deep down there was always an emotional conflict around wanting to know for sure what I was racially from my biological fathers side. I appreciate that my adoptive father raised me as his own daughter (as well as being grateful for my late adoptive mother)and Im not looking to replace my adoptive father. Rather around age 32 I discovered (from a phone conversation with the man who was purported to be my bio father) that there is not actually a guarantee that he is my biological father despite what some of my family members on my late biological mothers side may have originally thought (due to the controversial information that my bio mother worked as a prostitute even after I was born and they were still together). He at first politely offered to submit to a dna test in order to help me confirm all of my racial ethnicities and regrettably I at first declined. However, by the time I changed my mind (to confirm all of my racial identities) it was too late because I was no longer able to successfully contact him via phone. However, seeing the bold and brave journey that Angela took around locating both her birth parents (as well as showing appreciation to both her adoptive parents and husband) unexpectedly actually encouraged me to just let go of the whole idea of trying to successfully contact my birth father for a dna test (only for the purposes of confirming my full racial identity not to replace my adoptive father) and to instead just eventually order a dna test where I can find out all of my racial ancestries on my own. Im very glad and grateful that Angela and her family members courageously shared the Closure documentary and allowed the documentary to be shown for wide public release.",1437091200,2,3385,4.827882960413081
6140194,5,B00H8B87ZE,What a awesome life story.  I commend her for sharing her journey.,1426377600,,66,4.5
6140195,4,B00H8B87ZE,Very touching documentary.  I teared-up a few times.  Those adoptive parents are very special people.,1425513600,,101,5.666666666666667
6140196,5,B00H8B87ZE,What a beautiful family... I especially loved Angela. And Bryan. Kudos!,1425340800,,71,5.545454545454546
6140197,5,B00H8B87ZE,This was an excellent documentary that captivates the viewers attention from beginning to end. It pushes a lot of emotional buttons as the search for Angela's birth mother progresses.,1420934400,,183,5.344827586206897
6140198,4,B00H8B87ZE,Fast delivery.  The person I bought it for was very excited about getting it.,1420329600,,77,4.5
6140199,5,B00H8B87ZE,"One of our adopted children met his/her birthfamily two years ago.  As the adoptive mom, I met the birthfamily 5 months ago.  Ours was an international adoption, however there were many similarities between Angela's story (a domestic adoption) and our story (ie. feelings that needed to be processed by different members of the adoption triad).  It brought tears to my eyes . . .",1416355200,,379,4.890625
6140200,5,B00H8B87ZE,"This is truly an excellent documentary on adoption. It's rare to see all perspectives sensitively handled this way - the adoptive parents, biological parents, and most importantly, the adopted child herself (now an adult). Not to give anything away, but it took a lot of courage on all sides to allow a lot of what's seen in this film, as it's perspective we rarely see, particularly with trans-racial adoptions. No one's trying to 'control the narrative' to spin a politically correct story; rather, we are all on this journey with Angela and her collective family. 'Closure' is so refreshingly honest that I was deeply moved. I Highly recommend it!",1415404800,,650,4.972477064220183
6140201,5,B00H8B87ZE,"This is a great documentary!  Such an engaging, entertaining, and intriguing story, but not only that - this is a very well-made movie.  The music is great, the cinematography is great, and the transitions are great.
You know how sometimes documentaries, even if they are really good, aren't the kind of ""movie"" that you sit down with a bowl of popcorn to enjoy as entertainment?  This is highly enjoyable.  You will learn and your mind will be opened, but it's not so deep that it feels like work to watch.  I think anyone, of any age, would highly enjoy this film.",1401235200,,566,4.564356435643564
6140202,5,B00H8B87ZE,How rare it is to be able to view an intimate journey of an adoptee seeking out answers she has faced growing up.  How nice it is as well to have a director/editor be respectful of this intimate journey.,1399334400,,203,4.205128205128205
6140203,5,B00H8B87ZE,"A compelling and well made documentary.  Angela's story and her search for her birth family is inspirational, and incredibly moving.

6140206,5,B00H8B87ZE,"This is a very well-done documentary of one adoptee's search for her birthparents.  I laughed; I cried!  I highly recommend it to everyone involved in adoption, or anyone interested in a well-done documentary.",1388448000,2,209,5.303030303030303

6140208,5,B00H8B87ZE,"What a fantastic documentary. It's a balanced look at adoption from an adoptee and even birth parent perspective. As a future adoptive parent, I appreciated hearing Angela's voice during the search for her birth family. I loved seeing how her two mothers (adoptive and birth) interacted.

The sound track is good. The story is compelling and real. You should watch this film.",1387411200,3,375,5.048387096774194

8630803,5,B00H8B87ZE,"If you are someone who enjoys feel good content Closure definitley delivers.

It's suspenseful, moving, there's moments I felt sad, moments I felt anger and situations that came as a total shock.

I fell in love for Angela's support system and it shows the kind of heart you need to support adoptees.

If you a seeking some encouragment in your own search Closure will show you some creative ways to search for your bio family.

I hope you enjoy Closure as much as I did.",1516320000,,471,4.5058823529411764

8630808,5,B00H8B87ZE,"This documentary was recommended by our adoption home study provider and it was a really great story.  It didn't really apply to our situation because we have a super open adoption so there will be no birth parent search, but this is a reality for many older adoptees.",1500336000,,268,4.583333333333333
