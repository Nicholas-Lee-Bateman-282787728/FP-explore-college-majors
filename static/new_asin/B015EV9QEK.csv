7433682,1,B015EV9QEK,"I have a lot of experience doing yoga; about 20 years worth.  I purchased this DVD after reading the review on Amazon.  I am terribly disappointed.  These work-outs are not in any way meant for beginner yoga students, and I believe an intermediate student would still find them discouraging.  Travis' commentary seriously lacks instruction or even decent cues so you know where you are supposed to be; I found myself spending way too much time looking at the screen trying to figure out what he was talking about.  Also, I am all accepting of 'artful lighting', but when the shadows are so overwhelming that you can't see what he is doing, then the art overcomes the purpose and I didn't purchase an artwork.  This lack of lighting and lack of verbal cues so completely turned me off that I got half way thru Travis 1 (there are 3 workouts) and gave up in disgust.  What should have been an enjoyable experience became frustrating and irritating.",1364688000,,946,4.696969696969697
7433683,5,B015EV9QEK,A great short workout if you are tight on time. It really gets your heart rate pumping and the music is very relaxing,1364428800,,117,4.130434782608695
7433684,5,B015EV9QEK,"I have two young kids, I work, and my husband is away a lot. I don't have a lot of time to exercise. I love this DVD. The voice is calm, the music is nice and it is a great 30 minute workout. I absolutly love the DVD and I highly recommend it. Would I recommend it for a beginner? Sure! It is only 30 minutes. Would I recommend it to a super fit yogi? Sure! It is a very good 30 minute morning routine for those of you that don't have a lot of extra time in your day.",1363996800,,467,3.68
7433685,5,B015EV9QEK,"I have been collecting yoga ""videos"" for over 25 years.  This DVD is traditional yoga based on practitioners like Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, etc.  It is a challenging, but manageable set of workouts.  The length of these work outs of 30 min each is perfect.  I wish more DVD's would follow this format.  I have stacks of videos that run over an hour and more (Mark Blanchard) that collect dust due to time constraints.  I am an avid and loyal yoga follower and work out every day, sometimes twice a day, but more than a 40 min video just doesnt work for me.
The content of these practices is exceptional, and the music that accompanies the workouts is phenomenol!!  I look forward to more DVD's from Travis Eliot.  He is an incredible instructor!!",1362355200,7,748,4.571428571428571
7433686,5,B015EV9QEK,"In the past couple of months I have bought all of Travis' individual DVD's and love all of them. I really wanted to get into a good yoga practice, and would try others, but never stuck with it. Travis takes yoga to a different/ much better level in my opinion - especially for people like myself that get into more challenging workouts, like Cross Fit, Insanity, and P90X. I think part of the reason I balked at yoga, was it never felt like I was really doing ""anything."" WELL....Short and Sweet Changes all of that :-D I honestly can't say enough good about it. Not only do you get a fantastic workout, you also feel relaxed yet energized, the way you expect to after a good yoga practice. Each practice is great in its own right. ""Only"" 30 mins, but trust me each minute counts. Travis cues better than any other. You really don't have to watch the DVD because the cues are spot on. The music is fantastic. I would highly recommend the Ultimate Yogi Soundtrack too :-) I would say this DVD is a little more advanced, so if you are new to yoga you might want to start with Yoga Foundations and then Cross Train before this one. Enjoy!",1361577600,4,1135,4.3584905660377355
7433687,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is the best set of short yoga workouts I have ever tried.  I was first introduced to yoga whenever I did P90X the first time.  I loved the power yoga used in the series, but I could not stand how long it was (90 minutes).  I then discovered Fountain of Youth Yoga from Tony Horton's One on One series.  That was a much more manageable 45 minute length and still gave me a great workout.  I've also tried some shorter routines (45 minutes or less) from Rodney Yee, Bob Harper, and Dave Farmar, some of which were good, others not so good.  However, these four 30 minute routines trump all the other shorter yoga workouts that I have tried.  Each of the routines have a fast pace, yet you will still hold most of the poses for a sufficient amount of time.  There is a terrific variety of stretches, poses, and flows throughout each of the workouts, and all 4 of the routines are unique and never feel repetitive.  Travis also gives excellent cues and I hardly ever have to look up at the TV.  Whenever I want a short yoga routine when I'm short on time, I'll never again use anything but these.",1359590400,10,1097,4.307317073170732
7433688,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is my first of Travis Eliot's yoga dvds. I must say I am quite impressed. I love that they are only 30 minutes a piece. His voice is perfect and not a lot of chatter either. The music is awesome. I have only practiced the first two sessions however, I am hooked on him. Looking forward to purchasing his other dvds. As the other reviewer suggested to purchase the ""Foundation"" DVD if you are a beginner.",1359072000,4,408,4.311688311688312
7433689,5,B015EV9QEK,"These are four fast-moving workouts -- each one fits a full-body workout into about 30 minutes, so there's a considerable cardio effect -- but they do not feel rushed, because they're very well-sequenced and the instructors are calm and methodical. All the workouts are classic power yoga, but each one feels different: Travis 1 is mostly standing poses with a short floor sequence including abs; Travis 2 has more balance work (standing and quadruped) and some plank work; Travis 3 is leg intensive, with a fun twisting/balancing sequence; and Lauren's workout is so fast it's exhilarating, with standing and arm balance work included. All the cuing is excellent. The poses are accessible for all levels, but you might want some yoga experience before attempting this DVD, just because there's so much packed into each workout that it could be hard to follow otherwise. For a yoga intermediate who's short on time but wants a real yoga workout, these practices are perfect.",1357344000,15,974,5.055900621118012
7433690,4,B015EV9QEK,"I love Travis Eliot's practices and knew I'd like this one.  Each of the four practices, three lead by Travis and one by Lauren, are about 30 minutes.  The music is wonderful, as it is in Ultimate Yogi 108, Foundations and Cross Training.  These videos are done in voice over, Travis actually does his practices and Lauren hers.  These are pretty physical practices and if I were a newbie I'd suggest Travis's Foundation first.  Great job and I look forward to more offerings!",1355097600,9,476,4.686746987951807
7433691,5,B015EV9QEK,"Really excellent quick and high impact workouts (X 3) with clear verbal explanation so that you can follow the sequence without having to constantly watch the screen. Very direct, clear and 'no nonsense' approach with just the right level of self-awareness / spiritual emphasis. After purchasing several yoga DVD's Travis is the best male yoga instructor I have been able to find.",1449014400,2,380,5.145161290322581
7433692,4,B015EV9QEK,"I started doing Ultimate Yogi(UY) last year & really enjoy those routines.  I was looking for some shorter workouts and decided to give these a try.  Although I feel like I get more out of the longer UY practices, these are great for mornings when I need a shorter workout.  On fitness forums, I've read that some are turned off by Travis' comments and new age philosophy on the UY practices, but it doesn't bother me at all.  On these routines, he is the only one performing the routine and the instruction is his voice-over.  There are no additional comments, so those who don't like his commentary may favor these.",1448150400,7,617,4.572727272727272
7433693,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is not missing a thing.  Balance,  strength and flexibility asana.  In 30 minutes this is non stop flow yoga. I was dripping sweat. Travis Eliot is always amazing.  A good investment.",1447977600,4,188,4.78125
7433694,4,B015EV9QEK,I like this DVD because it was a good solid total body workout when short on time. Basically you're hitting every body part in 30 minutes without feeling over worked at the end.  The yoga is challenging but difficult.  I would recommend this DVD for those who have a regular yoga practice and for days when you cannot commit to an hour of yoga.  I would not recommend to a beginner.,1377216000,,382,4.352112676056338
7433695,4,B015EV9QEK,This was just what I was looking for on busy days when a whole 45-60 minutes just is not going to happen.,1370822400,,105,3.8181818181818183
7433696,5,B015EV9QEK,"With 4 different 30 minute segments, this yoga dvd is a great addition to my workout.  I've done a lot of 90x, insanity, etc and this video is the perfect recovery for those workouts.  It is also a great workout in of itself.  The moves are clearly well described, straightforward to follow-up, yet still challenging.",1369699200,,317,4.7272727272727275
7433697,5,B015EV9QEK,"I have done yoga for several years and have a library of DVDs. This has become my new favorite. The workouts are quick, 30 minutes, but difficult enough to break a good sweat. The video is very well qued and you can easily follow along with just the audio. The workout is difficult and quick paced so it would prove difficult for novices, but for people with a basic understanding of yoga I would consider this dvd a must buy...",1369008000,2,428,4.3625
7433698,2,B015EV9QEK,"I enjoy vigorous power yoga workouts, but I found this DVD frustrating because it is too rushed and difficult to follow. The instructors talk fast and almost constantly, especially the female one, and there is no time to get into the poses properly and pay attention to the sensations. When I practice yoga I like to tune into my body and not just do calisthenics as fast as I can. The video and sound quality also could be improved. Backlighting (having the lights shining toward the camera) the instructors does not really work as their faces and bodies are in the shadow, and the busy background is distracting. As a result, it's hard to see what they are doing. If the workouts were cued better and done at a more relaxed pace, they could be very good.",1368662400,,756,4.525547445255475
7433699,5,B015EV9QEK,"Great workout in  a condensed version. Travis ( and Lauren) have soothing, easy to follow cues and I feel like I got a vigorous power yoga workout in just half hour. A must have for busy people when you can't fit in an hour. Love it!",1367366400,2,233,4.065217391304348
7433700,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is a good DVD to use for the mornings yoga sessions. Also, you can follow this guy's 108 day program. My wife did it and she felt it was worth it.",1366070400,,151,3.75
8733322,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is the perfect home Yoga DVD out there. I am a persona trainer . After a day at the gym I don't always have time for 60 minutes of yoga, but this 30 min DVD is perfect. I feel every muscle in my body , both worked and stretched. He is an amazing instructor . No need to leave the house !",1482192000,,292,3.6507936507936507
8733323,3,B015EV9QEK,I like the routines but hate the VLC file format on all of Travis Elliots DVD's they work fine in a DVD player but constantly freeze and crash on every computer I've tried playing them on.,1473638400,,188,4.25
8733324,5,B015EV9QEK,"These are not for the beginner, you will work hard and sweat through a continuous 30 minute flow.  Nothing fancy, just Travis on his mat.  (which is all I need!)  As another reviewer has said, this is a perfect compliment to the Ultimate Yogi collection!  For those days when you just don't have 60+ minutes but still want to follow the UY program.  Highly recommended.",1461542400,,369,4.615384615384615
8733325,4,B015EV9QEK,This DVD is no joke. The sessions are short but I've never sweat so much during yoga. I was sore for about a week after the first session but I'm getting used to the intensity.,1460678400,,176,4.057142857142857
8733326,5,B015EV9QEK,"This is one of my favorite yoga DVD's.  It is a challenging 30 minutes of yoga.  I have several yoga DVD's and Travis is great in the video,  the moves build on each other and his instruction is spot on.  His verbal cues throughout the exercise are perfect, you never have to strain your neck or try to figure out what you are supposed to be doing because he tells you clearly and concisely throughout the workout.",1454198400,2,414,4.337662337662338
8733327,5,B015EV9QEK,"Brilliant DVD, I love it thank you Travis.",1454198400,,42,4.375

8733329,5,B015EV9QEK,Perfect addition to my 108 Days of Yoga and Yoga Foundations with Travis Eliot.  It gets you going when time is short and does the job!!  Thanks Travis!,1453507200,2,152,4.392857142857143
