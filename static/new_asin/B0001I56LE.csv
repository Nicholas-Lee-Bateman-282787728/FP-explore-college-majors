2004258,5,B0001I56LE,"The acting is great and all, but what a great story. I think this may be the best of all the Prime Suspects--but they are all good. (I bought UK version so I saw it in widescreen.) The use of the fisheye (Super-wide angle) lens was interesting, although it made me almost dizzy sometimes.
No, Jane, you are not going to Bosnia. Yeah, right!
You'll recognize Ben Miles right away if you have seen Patrick in Coupling--in the first shot of him he has on his wayfarer sunglasses--reminiscent of the ""stop playing reservoir dogs"" scene from Coupling season 1.
Except for missing Haskins from the other Prime Suspects, this one is superb!",1089676800,4,633,4.660714285714286
2004259,5,B0001I56LE,"Helen Mirren once again returns in her Emmy Award-winning role as Jane Tennison in what is, I believe, the series' most powerful police drama yet. This sixth episode in Prime Suspect, ""The Last Witness,"" has Tennison hunting down the leaders of a paramilitary death squad in London. These men had perpetrated heinous crimes against humanity during the Balkan Civil War and could possibly be the cause of a terrible murder in Jane's jurisdiction.
Former Chief Detective Tennison, has now been promoted to overseeing all murder investigations in London. She is, as usual, battling the male establishment and coming to grips with advancing middle-age. At 54 she feels she is being pushed toward early retirement and the pressure and presence of ambitious younger colleagues who would love to have her job are ever present. At this point in her life Jane Tennison is also beginning to realize that her career has become her life - a sad and lonely realization.
When the body of a young Bosnian woman turns up, with signs of brutal, sadistic torture, Jane takes over the case. Her investigation leads her to one man, and perhaps two, who are alleged war criminals with much to hide as they attempt to make new lives for themselves in Britain. The murdered woman's older sister is finally found and promised protection in return for her story and assistance with the ongoing investigation. The police protection proves to be weaker than the will of the murderer to eliminate all possible witnesses to his crimes. And disaster strikes again with horrifying results. As usual Tennison risks all in her determination to bring the guilty to justice and in this sixth episode ""all"" could mean her career.
The Prime Suspect series has long been a favorite. Helen Mirren is superb as an actress in any role and absolutely shines as Jane Tennison. Ms. Mirren lends the correct mix of tough independence and vulnerability that are such an important part of the character. And her face mirrors all the emotion her character is feeling more eloquently than words. I heard Ms. Mirren say, in a recent interview with the press, that this will be the last Prime Suspect episode. I am very sorry to see it end but can't imagine a more fitting conclusion. Wonderful acting and drama. Highly recommended!

2004260,4,B0001I56LE,"I saw the 2nd part of this on Masterpiece Theater, and it's definitely the best of all 6. In this latest Prime Suspect Helen Mirren uncovers the murderer of 2 Bosnian refugees. The suspect turns out to be a Bosnia Serb war criminal, but is protected by the British government a la Szell in Marathon Man. Jane Tennison is older and wiser as she goes against orders to bring the mass killer turned smooth London professional to justice.
  The script writing is superior, even to the earlier episodes, as we get this psychological cat and mouse between Jane and the suspect, his wife, and his underling. And as part of the investigation Jane even travels to Bosnia and has the inevitable affair with her assistant. This shows the Bosnian war should not be forgotten and we've got to bring Mladic, Karadic, and the others to justice.",1082851200,2,829,4.671232876712328

Unlike other police series, it exposes the weaknesses of the characters as well as their personal strengths.  Helen Mirren is far from perfect in her role as DCI, that eventually evolves into her promotion as a leading investigator.  She also reveals the challenges  that confront a woman trying to shatter the glass ceiling of a male dominated detective bureau.

2004355,5,B0001I56LE,"Helen Mirren is one of her generation's greatest actresses. This film is outstanding. From the screenplay writing to the acting there is a true sense of excellence. The historical aspects about Bosnia are told sensitively, yet apparently accurately.  Watching this type of film and then watching a Hollywood film is liking eating a steak dinner and then settling for a MacDonald's Happy meal. There is no comparison. To think this was made for British TV and not for the big screen. Only one small inappropriate scene, which the film could have well done without.",1354320000,,563,4.98936170212766

2004358,5,B0001I56LE,"In, ""PRIME SUSPECT"" Helen Mirren makes the show as Tennison. Obsessed, work-driven, feminist attitude, course, in-your-face drive, quite believable. Mirren acts man-like rather than the occasional romantic side which does exist, she's a drinker, and she almost never smiles. The cases may not always end to your satisfaction--like real life. You'll be on the edge while you watch. ""Prime Suspect"" is compelling viewing, ruthless in detail, not for children or the squeamish, blatantly course visually and in dialogue.
Police drama changed forever by Helen Mirren's role as Jane Tennison.

Episode 6 of the complete series-A tortured and murdered female body leads an investigation through Bosnian illegals. There is a prime suspect but no convicting evidence. Will the truth be known prior to another murder?

Started in 1991 and ending in 2007, every series was a hit, and done with perfection. A female cop show will never be this good again. But be warned, for language, and gritty gruesome graphic content. Tennison not only colors outside the box, she makes the box.",1295136000,,1071,5.257309941520468

2004364,5,B0001I56LE,"Another great episode.  The historic background in which the plot is developed around is another shameful chapter in Humanity's history-Bosnian War (1992-1995), and the story develops around two sisters who survived the atrocities of that conflict and a war criminal in hiding whom are suddenly thrown in each others paths for one last time.  Mystery, suspense, sadness, shame, despair... are feelings that are respectfully not resolved in the last fifteen minutes but there is a little justice at the end, achieved only by the tenacity of Chief Superintendent Jane Tennison.",1168905600,5,575,5.377777777777778
2004365,5,B0001I56LE,"Prime Suspect 6 is, without question, the best of the Prime Suspect series.  The combination of a stellar cast, a fantastic script, inventive cinematography, and a haunting score add up to one of the more entertaining dramas I've seen, period.  Helen Mirren is, as usual, outstanding in the role of Jane Tennison.  The character is as strong as ever there is a real depth to her character in PS6, including some great scenes with Jane's father.  I recommend this wholeheartedly.  If you're a fan of Prime Suspect, and who else would be looking at this, you are going to love it.

I agree that the fact it is not widescreen is a disappointment, but it is still very enjoyable.  I believe the UK edition (widescreen) is now out of print, so this is the one we've got.  I'm not complaining.",1146009600,9,787,4.571428571428571
2004366,5,B0001I56LE,"This final installment in the Prime Suspect series has a few flaws--the directing is a little awkward and in some scenes they filmed Helen Mirren at some unecessarily unflattering angles.  Despite this Mirren and her character Tennison are as enthralling and captivating as ever!

After viewing all the episodes you look forward to that moment when Tennison is overwhelmed, the odds are against her, she is on the verge of being fired and she pulls a brilliant intuitive deduction out of the air and resolves the mystery.  British detective drama at its penultimate best!",1142726400,4,571,5.053191489361702
2004367,5,B0001I56LE,"Superb!  As usual Helen Mirren does a fantastic, convincing job as the conflicted, but tenacious Chief Inspector Jane Tennison facing multiple obstacles, personal, official and on procedural, while investigating a murder case.  The subplot concerning the attempt to force Jane to retire, and the unexpected turns in the case that lead her to go face-to-face with man's inhumanity to man (genocide) in Bosnia are tense and  well executed.

i admit I initially was a bit concerned about  the level of quality of this episode, after the long hiatus since PS #5, but I need not have been.  This is one of Mirren's best.

Go for it!",1141344000,3,627,4.8584905660377355
2004368,5,B0001I56LE,"I will demur extended comments on the film to the reviewers below.  Suffice to say, it is more taut, edgy, fast-paced, and visually compelling than the preceeding films.  Obviously, the great script was paramount  in Ms. Mirren's decision to return to the role.

My review has to do with the DVD presentation.  I obtained this U.S. release from Netflix before I knew that it had been cropped and mastered in pan & scan.  Much of this film has been shot with a super wide-angle lens, so after 30 seconds of viewing that P&S bastardization, it went back in the Netflix return envelope.  Then I purchased the widescreen Region 2 PAL version from Amazon UK.  It arrived in Los Angeles in under 10 days.

I have a Sony 34"" 16X9 direct-view set, and an all-region JVC NTSC/PAL DVD player.  You can pick up name-brand all-region NTSC/PAL players all over the web for usually less than $100.  They come in very handy with DVD's that are not available in the U.S.

The Region 2 disc looked fabulous; I cannot imagine watching this film butchered in P&S.  I highly suggest buying the widescreen version.

When you view all the other Pime Suspect DVD's, which are all also mastered in pan & scan, you realize they were  originally filmed in widescreen.  Perhaps some day, the entire, awesome series will be made available in the correct aspect ratios.",1106784000,74,1340,4.686695278969957
2004369,5,B0001I56LE,"I have always liked these Prime Suspect shows so I was excited to see another one out.  This episode is about a war criminal who is continuing his dark work in London on the same pair of sisters that he tortured in Bosnia during the war.

I really liked this one because it dealt with Bosnia and I have always been interested in that area.  It is also refreshing to see a sadistic war criminal brought to justice even if it is on the small screen.

I don't recommend this for everyone because it is very dark and depressing.  For anyone who knows about the war in the Balkans, the scene in the warehouse might be too much.  However, this show is still great.",1102896000,3,658,4.266129032258065
