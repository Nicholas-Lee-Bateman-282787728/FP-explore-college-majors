4597603,1,B0057OPOZA,"It's loud,obnoxious and annoying. There's never a silent moment where the film can just breath or take a break. It's nothing but noise. The life lesson in this TV Film was shoved in our faces so many times that I couldn't take it anymore. The comedy while it worked well in the cartoon, it failed in the live action movie. The villains are either an tired old cliche like oil tycoon or an insufferable cartoony nutacse like Mr. Crocker and Vicki. Infact,the whole acting is over-the-top and cartoony. The story is tried and cliche too. The jokes are lazy,tried and dumb. Not to mention there's also slime humor which I HATE so much. At least with The Last Airbender movie there were some silent moments,villain(s) that were subtle,a subtle morale and best of all, no smile humor.  The only good thing about his film is the guy who played Timmy's dad(who also voiced Timmy's dad in the cartoon) but even that fails to help the movie in the long run. I give this ""film"" a 0 out of 10.",1345507200,2,982,4.4860335195530725
4597604,3,B0057OPOZA,"I remember watching Timmy Turner when I was growing up and loved the show. So I introduced it to my kids. They love Fairly Odd Parents we watch it every day. So when I came across this I just knew I had to have it. My kids & I couldn't wait for it to get here so we could watch. When it did we watched it immediatley. My kids loved it & wacthed it 3 or 4 more times that day. Me, well I was disappointed. I guess I expected better. I expected to see Vicki (the babysitter), A.J. (Timmy's best friend), etc... It focused more on Timmy falling in love with Trixy (vicki's little sister). The fairies was great you couldn't have asked for better actors to play Wanda & Cosmo. My kids loved it and watches it all the time. Myself would watch with them but if I had to get up and fold laundry or cook dinner that it wouldn't break my heart to miss the movie.",1344729600,7,853,4.023529411764706
4597605,5,B0057OPOZA,"I have to put it this way. The kids love it. We're not talking Gone with the Wind or Citizen Kane here, we're talking a live action version of a Nick cartoon so as an adult don't expect much, but the kiddies seem to enjoy it as mine have watched it multiple times already. So based on that alone I am giving this a 5 star rating for the kids..

4597606,4,B0057OPOZA,This movie based on the animated series was very well done. I really enjoyed the cartoon and was not diappointed when I ordered this movie. It is the cartoon in movie form. The casting was right on! I really liked this movie!,1315440000,,225,4.380952380952381
4597607,5,B0057OPOZA,"Drake Bell is perfect for the part. The whole cast is great. It's a fun mix of animation and live action. If you are not a follower of Fairly Odd Parents you will still be able to follow the plot and you will understand the relationships of the charaters easily. I'm a grandfather and I shared it with my grandson who is 12 and he really enjoyed it. My 4 and 6 year old granddaughters, not so much. My wife liked it too.

4597608,5,B0057OPOZA,"There are two versions on this DVD:  The premier and the rerun.  There is no new scenes on it.  The good thing is in the premier verson (the one with Vicki, Chester, and AJ), which isn't for sale in the Playstation store and ITunes.  This is a plus since my favorite parts were the ones with Vicki because what stuff she yells makes me laugh.  I missed these scenes on the ITunes verson.  It would have been a little better if they put in some deleted scenes that weren't in the premere.  For instance, I found no Jay Lenno in it, and they gave him credit on the cast list here on Amazon.",1310860800,5,588,4.150442477876106
4597609,5,B0057OPOZA,A Fairly OddParents Movie: Grow Up Timmy Turner is the best Fairly OddParents movie I have ever seen! The reason why it is the best is because it is so romantic watching Timmy fall in love with the once dorky but now most beautiful Tootie and watching how love changes Timmy for the better.,1310688000,6,290,4.388888888888889
4597610,4,B0057OPOZA,"Note: I don't own the DVD to this. This is based on the movie I saw on the day it came out, the extended premiere edition.

To honor the 10th Anniversary of The Fairly OddParents, a live action movie was made called ""A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up Timmy Turner"".

The story focuses on Timmy Turner (played by Drake Bell) who at the age of 23 is still a kid at heart. He still lives at home with his parents, still attending the 5th grade and has his godparents Cosmo (voiced by Daran Norris; live-action by Jason Alexander), Wanda (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee; live action by Cheryl Hines) and baby Poof. The reason being is that Da Rules dictate that godchildren lose their family if they grow up to be adults. However when Tootie (played by Daniella Monet in both her geeky and beautiful looks) returns after a 13-year absence looking beautiful, Timmy begins to have strange adult-like feelings for her. This leaves him making a very difficult decision; grow up and be with the one person that he loves or stay as a kid and be with the fairy godparents he considers his family. At the same time, Timmy's crazy teacher Denzel Crocker (played by David Lewis) teams up with a rich oil tycoon named Hugh J. Magnate Jr (played by Steven Weber) and captures Timmy's fairy godparents in the hopes that they can fulfill their sinister goals. With Timmy's godparents captured and used for their evil ends, Timmy must now make a decision that can change his life forever.

My thoughts about this movie, it's alright but I have a few complaints. The good things are the actors that they chose for the movie. Drake Bell does really good for Timmy Turner even without the signature buckteeth. Daniella Monet was exquisite playing the beautiful Tootie as well as the geeky Tootie too. Daran Norris earns my award for best actor here nailing Mr. Turner. Teryl Rothery did great for Timmy's mom. David Lewis did real good as Denzel Crocker though I feel that Carlos Alazraqui should have took the part. He'd make a better Crocker yet I wonder why Tara Strong didn't portray Timmy in this film. Oh well. Steven Weber was good as the villain for this movie though he wasn't taken seriously. The movie felt like the actual cartoon with much of its humor and that's a good thing. Also, the song that Drake and Daniella did was so cute to sing along with. It's perfect.

However, even with some of the good things there are a few problms with this. First off, some characters were only given minor roles which was a letdown such as Vicky (played by Devon Weigel), Chester (played by Chris Anderson) and AJ (played by Jesse Reid). Also, some characters such as Trixie and Veronica were not involved in the film at all. After the disaster that was Wishology, I think Butch Hartman made the right choice in my opinion. I have another complaint and that is regarding Cosmo and Wanda's live action roles. Jason Alexander does okay for Cosmo but Cheryl Hines isn't my kind of choice. In addition, how they schemed to prevent Timmy from falling in a love is out-of character and makes me question why they do it. Hugh J. Magnate wasn't really a serious villain and his grand scheme was just childish but with a movie like that, what can you do. The ending also leaves some questions as well. I can't spoil it for the sake of the review but it makes me wonder where will Butch go at it from here? What he does is of his choosing.

But regardless, the movie even with its faults is okay so my final score for it is a 4 out of 5 though if I was brutally honest, I'd give it at most a 3 out of 5. The acting choices were good and the film sort of decides Timmy's future which we already know by this. However, some characters downgraded to minor roles and the villain wasn't taken seriously. Overall, a good movie so if you get a chance check it out. You won't be disappointed. One other thing, the DVD has both the edited and unedited versions of the film. Why did they do that? I don't know but I wish that this would get a proper DVD release with better features. Also, I feel that as a fan of the series an extended edition would be nice with some new scenes and a followup to the end. Other than that, Butch Hartman did the show justice and in a proper way too.

My final score for this is a 4 out of 5. That's it.",1310601600,11,4286,4.40530303030303
4597611,4,B0057OPOZA,"ok, so I havn't bought this item yet, but i've seen it on tv twice. It is hilarious and I have no complaints exept that it was way too short! It was only one hour and 12 minutes. hopefully when I get it on dvd they will have an extended version, which I doubt... It stars DRAKE BELL as Timmy turner. DANIELA monet as tootie. Really great movie but too short. Another thing that I loved was drake bell! he is sooooo awesome, if you havn't ever seen drake and josh, you should its so funny!!!
update:So word is that the dvd is an extended version of ""a fairly odd movie, grow up timmy turner"" so thats good and bad... good- It's a little bit longer than the tv airing. bad- They probably just did that for money so we would have to buy the dvd. cheaters... Anyway, I highly recomend this movie for anyone who likes nickelodeon. They realy did a good job at bringing the animated show to life!",1310342400,6,890,4.2105263157894735

4597620,1,B0057OPOZA,"*Spoilers in this Review*

Kids may enjoy this movie but chances are, they're only laughing because it contains a lot of stupid/dumb jokes (such as bird poop on head, a bunny laughing evilly, baby talks in punk-like voice, etc..
This movie does not hold true to the show on so many levels... so if your kid watches this, s/he may be a little disappointed in some areas...
I would recommend renting this and not buying it (although I personally think renting is a waste of money... even if its cheap... worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life).
This movie was made with one purpose: to make money.
Seriously.
What else is the purpose of a movie that isn't consistent with it's show?
Kids may not fully understand how bad a movie this is, which is fine... it was made for them to enjoy. However, I would recommend buying a movie that can deliver laughs, makes sense, and teaches kids a lesson. (The only lesson here I found was that it's okay to never grow up. Yes, I'm serious. In the end, Timmy is able to keep his fairies and act like a kid for the rest of his life. Moral? You don't have to ever grow up.)
Anyways, there are so many other (better) movies than this one.
The show is awesome, the movie.... horrible.
Let your kids watch it (get it out of their system), but don't own/buy it. (unless you have a ""bad movie"" collection).",1390262400,4,1342,4.368

4597625,2,B0057OPOZA,"A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!(2011) is a live action TV movie produced by Nickelodeon and directed by Savage Steve Holland(creator of Eek the Cat). The Fairly Oddparents is an animated TV show created by Butch Hartman. A Fairly Odd Movie took a lot of criticism from Fairly Oddparents fans and movie and TV critics. The TV movie did well with high ratings and it spawned a sequel, A Fairly Odd Christmas(2012). This film was going to get a theatrical release, but it went straight to TV and cable. I purchased my copy on a ""special DVD-R release""! A Fairly Odd Movie Grow Up Timmy Turner is fun and loaded with vibrant colors, but it's campy, packed with noise and extremely fast paced! It's like adding speed, sugar and coffee to a broken merry-go-round! In the film, an adult Timmy Turner(Drake Bell) has to rescue Tootie(Daniella Monet) and his fairy godparents without help from magic tricks. They're being held hostage by an evil rich guy. There's a little bit of toilet humor. A teacher loses control of his bowels and a bird poops on a man's bald head! Jason Alexander from Seinfeld plays a flesh and blood version of godparent Cosmo. Drake Bell is decent as Timmy Turner. Daniella Monet is superb as Tootie. She's extremely sexy, yet she still has a wholesome, girl next door warmth. Daniella Monet could be good as Ann Marie in a modern Hollywood reboot of That Girl. A Fairly Odd Movie is bad, but not a turkey. It's somewhere between Gone With the Wind(1939) and Monster A Go Go(1965). A Fairly Odd Movie Grow Up Timmy Turner is a decent TV movie.",1365638400,,1571,4.614285714285714

4597627,1,B0057OPOZA,"To me, I really despised this movie. And not because I am a huge Timmy and Trixie fan, but because I know most live action movies based off cartoons bring shame to the show's image. And that is the fact that this movie is even more stupid than Cosmo's I.Q. Lame villain, kind of stupid plot and there are no ties to the television series at all (such as missing characters important to the series, no explanation to why Poof is still so young even though Timmy has aged or mention of Timmy's true love Trixie). It kind of felt like I was watching the live action ""Yogi Bear"" movie with an almost similar plot.

Nick should NEVER do another FOP movie unless it is cartoon and stays true to the series which has lasted nearly as long as Spongebob and a TRUE cartoon among today's crap.",1347753600,,783,4.326530612244898
