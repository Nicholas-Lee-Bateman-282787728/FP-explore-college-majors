8373570,5,B002M51UG4,"I saw this movie in the morning (with a BAD hangover) as part of the Palm Springs Film Festival. I didn't pay much attention, but I knew I missed something really fun. So I decided to watch it again when it came on streaming.

It's often described as a childish tale, and that's accurate, but I love the beautiful graphics tied in with the fantastic music. It's more of a instrumental journey of a person viewing the earth long after humans have left and how he travels to get here, what happens when he gets here and it does turn a bit eerie, at least to adults, children will appreciate the graphics but the tale does turn dark.

I truly appreciate a movie that can be viewed by children for the fun and adults for something more deep and enjoyed by all.",1454112000,,756,4.316901408450704

8373572,5,B002M51UG4,"I am going to keep this short.  If you cross Wall-E, with Wallace and Grommit and Shaun the Sheep you get this charming movie.  A true sleeper and a keeper.

The cat is just too cute.",1363478400,,183,4.027777777777778
8373573,5,B002M51UG4,"This is an animated movie with no voice.  This is no hindrance and helps to make this film enjoyable for all ages.  It is cute, and does attempt to give a message.  A movie  that you will want to watch more than one time.",1351641600,,221,3.9545454545454546
8373574,5,B002M51UG4,"This is a must see movie.  Wildly imaginative, funny and unique.  Don't get bored with the first part of it and give up on it.  The 2nd half is mind boggling and often breath taking.  Get past that there is no dialogue in the film but instead just sounds that the characters make which is a little annoying.  Get past that and what you will end up with probably to your satisfaction is a Wallace and Grommit movie on steriods.",1343952000,,426,4.275
8373575,4,B002M51UG4,"well, i do love dialog in movies this one expressed it through both eyes in a universal language. not understanding what anyone was saying since it was all alien language i thought at earth we would hear English or something,.. instead it was still gibberish. however it was all easy to translate through body movement, gestures and actions. pretty much inspired me to want to clean up the earth , build my own interstellar space craft in my garage , pack up and go travel. awesome movie. a must see if you need a clearer eye as to what it might be like somewhere else in space and the need to dream and do. great for all ages. also a good reminder as to the troubles and toils of owning a cat. patience is a must.",1319241600,,714,4.257352941176471
8373576,3,B002M51UG4,"No voices,just grunts and growns. Cheap but great affects ok for children 7 and up. Story line ok,but could have been better. My son at 7yrs liked it!",1299888000,,150,4.392857142857143
8373577,5,B002M51UG4,"The creators of this precious film really out-did themselves. The big animation companies have NOTHING on these guys. It has heart and soul. The animation is just mind-blowing. The soundtrack is rich and superbly matched as though the music came before the story line. There are quality details in the camera angles and picture that are really unique.
I will buy it for birthday gifts for everyone I know, child and adult, until they all have a copy.",1266537600,3,450,4.782051282051282
8373578,5,B002M51UG4,"I ordered this movie on Pay-Per-View a month or two ago for my kids to watch (toddlers), because the animation looked relaxing.

Interestingly, there is no comprehensible dialogue in the entire movie. In that, it is somewhat akin to Wall-E or, perhaps, a Cirque du Solei show. It is a Hungarian movie, so I assume the goal was to make a movie that could be enjoyed by people who do not speak Hungarian.

The plot is interesting. A farmer and his very fat cat find some NASA wreckage and the farmer, who likes to tinker in a home-made observatory, quickly throws together a space ship and sets off to find the place where the wreckage came from. Turns out, the man and his cat are aliens (so, strictly speaking, they are neither a human, nor a cat).

I do not want to say too much about it, but I was swept away by the visuals, and the soundtrack was also very well done. I was particularly impressed with the farmer and his cat flying through our solar system checking each planet to see which one was the right one -- I think I actually learned a bit about the planets. Overall, this movie was a great surprise, fully of charm and whimsy. It also had an unmistakable foreign feeling, like Spirited Away or Les Triplettes de Belleville, or even Wallace and Grommit.

I think this movie is good for kids of any age, and adults, too. To be clear, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD itself.",1266451200,6,1395,4.3538461538461535
