8375291,3,B002NPHQBQ,"The version of Babes in Toyland has a lot of charm, and worth watching more than once, especially with little children. Imaginative sets and dance scenes would be good if you wanted ideas for a theatrical remake, also. That was why I gave the set 3 stars, instead of 2. Scrooge was mildly interesting because it was filmed so long ago (1935) that the set dressings and costuming were probably more appropriate for a miserly pinchpenny character like scrooge. The film was not for me, being very darkly lit, slow and just too dated. The Christmas Angels unfortunately was forgettable also.",1449446400,,588,4.8316831683168315

8375293,4,B002NPHQBQ,"For the record, I do not work for Legend Films nor have any relatives or friends who do, so I am totally unbiased. I bought this three-disc combo & I'm very well-pleased! These three discs are from Legend Films, noted for its great colorizing & film restoration of B/W originals. March of Wooden Soldiers is fabulous colorization by Legend. Scrooge & Beyond Christmas versions here do have a few shortcomings by Legend, but for the combo price, these are a money-saving bargain versus buying three separate discs! Plus these combo discs are filled with extra features & shorts! A few remarks:
1.) The 1935 Scrooge here is an edited version of full original, having been cut some 18 minutes (60 vs. 78 original). If you want to buy the full 78-minute original, it does help fill in a few odd gaps in the edited version (most notably at beginning of Ghost of Christmas Future segment when Tiny Tim has died), but the 60-minute version here in this combo gives all the important parts. The color is a little bit pastel-leaning vs. Legend's later color results on other films (like 2007 Legend colorized ""It's a Wonderful Life""), but Scrooge was colorized earlier so the pastel-leaning colors are understandable since colorization technology was still evolving.
2.) Beyond Christmas is a renamed & edited version of the full original called Beyond Tomorrow. This Beyond Christmas version has 6 minutes cut (79 vs. 85 original). However, Legend did put 5 of these cut 6 minutes back in as four Deleted Scenes. There is one scene that is still missing from Legend color & B/W versions, not shown in Deleted though. This completely-cut scene occurs at beginning of Scene 8 (29 minutes into film) when they all appear at girlfriend's workplace to bring presents to kids. This edited version chops off the first 22 seconds of them arriving, not a big loss of plot or story flow.
3.) Beyond Christmas, in both the color & B/W versions here by Legend, does have one other quirk vs. the 85-minute original. In the Legend version, the last 5 seconds of Scene 11 (where leading man walks up the stairs drunk while butler shakes his head) are then oddly repeated in Scene 12 (54 & 1/2 minutes into film during thunder booming segment) & are out-of-sequence. These 5 seconds do not repeat in original 85-minute version, so Legend goofed for some reason. The color is a little bit pastel-leaning in this movie also vs. Legend's later color results on other films, such as Legend's 2007 vibrantly-colorized ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Yet Beyond Christmas was colorized earlier than Wonderful Life, thus earlier colorization technology & it is understandable that colors lean towards pastel vs. being vibrant.
4.) March of Wooden Soldiers has gorgeous, vibrant, fabulous color (no pastel-leaning) & is a terrific result by Legend. No editing or oddities either with this Legend Films product!
5.) All in all, I highly recommend these Legend Films if you want colorization & well-restored B/W versions!",1358035200,4,2980,4.9146825396825395
