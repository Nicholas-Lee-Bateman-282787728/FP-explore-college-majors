It described in details the spectacular terror and bloody acts performed by Carlos.

I liked the interesting questions raised by the narrator: Why so many countries were willing to harbor such an infamous terrorist? The answer was intriguing: Its because they can give him up later for some political benefit.

In short, its definitely worth watching.",1426550400,,476,5.1558441558441555
