1332585,3,B00003RQOK,"Not a classic by any means, the DVD release of DIXIANA allows us to view an early (1930) talkie musical in pristine picture and sound, suggesting how it must of appeared to audiences of that day.  Best of all, the last  couple of reels have been restored to their original two-strip Technicolor  beauty.
Bebe Daniela is charming and proves that a silent screen star  could effortlessly make the transition to talkies.  The male lead is played  by Metropolitian Opera star Everett Marshall who displays a fine singing  voice but limited acting talent.
The real star of this DVD is the  stunning picture and sound.  The short subject, La Cucharacha, is a nice  bonus.  While not as sharp as the feature visually, the historic importance  of this short compliments DIXIANA nicely. In all, a highly recommended DVD.",955929600,17,811,4.882352941176471

1332633,5,B00003RQOK,"Considering the enormous loss of early sound films, it is amazing that Dixiana survived at all. We cannot sit in 2013 and wonder why a film from 1930 does not seem to measure up.  We must see it from the viewpoint of that time. 1929 began one of the many financial ""Panics in American history before they were called, ""Depressions"", and general laughter was not easily on the lip. Sex was suggested and, the audiences were not clubbed over the head with it as they are today. Wheeler and Wolsey were not famous by accident.  Again, a softer humor was adequate for that time, when it was all absolutely new.  Harry Tierney, a household name, was one of the great universally admired American composers for the stage at that time, and Dixiana was first conceived as a stage piece. The public believed, and needed to believe, that happy endings were possible and did not need to be taken through dark psychological labyrinths to find the ""truth"" they needed. How  fortunate they were. Thanks, John Wilson, Music Historian",1369872000,7,1018,4.734463276836158
1332634,5,B00003RQOK,"DIXIANA is in the public domain, which means that there are many companies that have released versions missing footage that is vital to the plot, as well as being in the original, two-color Technicolor. This Roan version, a version from Grapevine, and possibly a newly-released version do contain the complete film as released in the late summer of 1930. The film is a good example of the extravagant operetta genre popular in the early days of sound. If you don't like musicals, no, you will not like this, but if you are the type of person who watches a film and appreciates the era in which it was filmed, you will like this. The 1934 short LA CUCARACHA is included here, the first live-action film shot in the three-color Technicolor process.",1368748800,,746,4.702290076335878
1332635,3,B00003RQOK,"I had never seen the comedy team of Wheeler and Woolsey before I saw this movie, and at the very least they are an acquired taste. They were a successful Broadway act that made several movies together, all along the same style as this one. Wheeler plays the wide-eyed innocent to the more caustic Woolsey, whose comedy is very reminiscent of George Burns. ""Dixiana"" is basically a musical drama played out in the pre-Civil War south with comedy bits by Wheeler and Woolsey interspersed with the dramatic storyline. The problem is, this movie is just not big enough for the two of them. Wheeler and Woolsey's comedy really has nothing to do with the dramatic storyline, and the dramatic storyline is totally divorced from Wheeler and Woolsey's characters. Another problem is that large parts of the dramatic storyline never get sewed up. For example, there is a scene where the villain says he had something to do with rigging a duel involving a relative of the hero of the dramatic storyline - and that's the last we ever hear of it.

The music is pretty good, and the musical numbers have very lavish and in some cases unusual sets and costumes. The prime example is the opening number with Wheeler and Woolsey dressed up as dancing ostriches and Dixiana popping out of an egg to do her part of the musical number. Wheeler and Woolsey's comedy in this particular film falls flat by today's standards, but it is watchable enough and interesting since Wheeler and Woolsey kept RKO afloat during the Great Depression. I'd say it's worth viewing just for the weirdness of it all.

Cucharacha is an interesting little bonus to the set, mainly because of it being the earliest three-strip live action feature, made in 1934. The movies could finally do blue! Compare it to the two-strip color in the finale of Dixiana.

If you care about sound and video quality, this is the only copy of Dixiana worth having, since it has been restored along with its Technicolor sequences. The versions you see for eight dollars or in the fifty movie packs are hard to look at and harder to listen to and do not have the Technicolor sequences. Plus, several key scenes have been hacked out of those versions. I'm glad Roan restored this old musical, one of the last of its kind until Busby Berkeley revived the musical genre in 1933.",1222387200,5,2312,4.689655172413793

1332637,2,B00003RQOK,"""Dixiana"" is perhaps the worst Wheeler & Woolsey comedy I have ever seen. The good news is, because it is so bad, rarely will you have to sit down and watch a movie as bad.

 ""Dixiana"" is one of your typical RKO lavish musicals with big costumes and sets, a somewhat pleasant musical score, and a mixture of romance/comedy/musical. But the film fails to live up to the standard other RKO pictures have set.

 First of all, I'm not the biggest Wheeler & Woolsey fan in the world. I have however seen 14 of their films together. Why? I like to collect rare films and Wheeler & Woolsey films are rare. If I see one I don't like to pass up the opportunity of collecting them.

 I don't think Wheeler and Woolsey were as funny as some of the other comedians and comedy teams of their era. I find I'm much more involved in the work of Chaplin, Keaton, Fields, Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers. This is not to say I'm incapable of enjoying one of their films. I am. I have seen a few that I really enjoyed.

 ""Dixiana"" takes place in the old south and tells the story of Carl Van Horn (Everett Marshall, whose mustache looks like it is about to eat him alive) he has fallen in love with a circus performer, Dixiana (Bebe Daniels) and plans on marrying her, which will break up her act with two comics, Peewee (Bert Wheeler) and Ginger (Robert Woolsey). Carl's father and stepmother however do not know about Dixiana's past and his stepmother will not allow Carl to marry the women fearing it will ruin her chance of getting into society, especially since Carl's father Cornelius (Joseph Cawthon, who appeared in the much funnier Wheeler and Woolsey comedy ""Peach-O-Reno"") has just inherited his family's Southern planation.

 One of the film's biggest mistakes is not allowing Wheeler and Woolsey room for their comedy, even though it is pretty dated with Woolsey's stale one-liners. But, it is my opinion, the best Wheeler and Woolsey films were the ones that didn't concentrate so much on the plot but gave the comedy team plenty of room to do their stuff, that would include ""Diplomaniacs"" (their best film and one of the funniest comedies of all time), ""Peach-O-Reno"" and ""Hips, Hips, Hooray"". ""Dixiana"" on the other hand take too much time away from the team and injects too much romance. Over half the film involves the love story going on between Dixiana and Carl. We've seen this situation before, especially in Marx Brother comedies made after ""Duck Soup"" and Laurel and Hardy films of the 40's. It usually upsets fans of the comedy teams because they are mainly there to serve as comic relief, but the comedians usually have all the best parts. And that's pretty much true in the case of this film as well. While I admit, the film as a whole isn't very funny, the film's best moments are when Wheeler and Woolsey are on-screen.

 Some people also complain the film is racist. I thought only the film's beginning moments, including the title song sung over the opening credits, showcased a kind of racist humor, that no doubt was seen as harmless in the day. I don't think a large number of people though would find the film offensive, in less of course you find unfunny films offensive.

 Dorothy Lee has a very minor, and useless part in the film as Nanny, a dancer in a gambling casino Wheeler and Woolsey find themselves working in. Lee makes her appearance 50 minutes into the film, and the movie is only 99 minutes to begin with! Her character provides nothing to the story at all, despite the fact that I usually like her. I will in all fairness say her first appearance in the film gives Wheeler and Woolsey perhaps their best routine in the film as each man tries to go up to her room without the other one knowing.

 ""Dixiana"" was directed by Luther Reed, a studio director whom had directed Wheeler and Woolsey's first film, ""Rio Rita"". ""Rita"" in my opinion was not a great film either, it suffered from this film's same problem of having Wheeler and Woolsey as comic relief, but it is more watchable than ""Dixiana"". Reed also wrote the film but it was based on a story by Anne Caldwell, who served as a writing source for Wheeler and Woolsey's next film, ""Half Shot at Sunrise"" (another far better Wheeler and Woolsey comedy). I mention this because Reed and Caldwell have worked with the team before so I find it odd how badly things went here. ""Dixiana"" was the team's third film (coming behind, in order, ""Rio Rita"" and ""The Cuckoos"", the latter being the better of the three) and proves to be lackluster and boring at best.

Bottom-line: The stale humor of Wheeler and Woolsey mixed with some racist undertones of the ol' south make ""Dixiana"" better left unseen. The comedy team is reduced to comic relief (and they barely provide any relief) and is plagued by bad joke after bad joke. Perhaps their worst film.",1163030400,2,4835,4.584009269988412
1332638,5,B00003RQOK,"Recently at the Silent theatere in L.A. 30's style singer Janet Klein revived a song from Dixiana ""I am Your Baby Now"".  In the film Bebe Daniles sings it, and she sings it after being carried on stage by two giant Ostriches, and she pops out of an egg, so sing it!  Great performance.  The film is funny and faetures soem great vaudevillians.  A cute film with loads of charm, and a nice roamntic comedy.  Although I must admid my favorite part of the film is Bebe singing in the egg!!!",1141862400,3,487,4.3076923076923075
1332639,4,B00003RQOK,"Dixiana has been variously described as a 'dog', a 'prehistoric turkey', and worse before now (and that's from people who generally liked it and the people in it!).  It's a clunky mix of operetta and vaudeville musical comedy which doesn't quite gel, but is typical of its period right at the dawn of the talking picture.
The DVD has been lovingly restored so even the two-strip colour sequence at the end looks pristine.  In the cast, Bebe Daniels and Everett Marshall sing well enough - he wasn't a great actor, but never mind - and Wheeler and Woolsey, that talented pair of clowns from RKO's first decade, add their archaic brand of humour between the serious musical bits.  Dixiana is far from their best but it is their only movie easily available, so it will have to do.",1076889600,9,777,4.615942028985507
1332640,3,B00003RQOK,"I have no idea what the reviewer of the ""Mexicos finest performers"" is babbling about. The ""La Cucaracha"" presented together with ""Dixiana"" is a double lame short dance/guitar-tink-a-tanking extravaganza, notable merely for it's place on the Technicolor stairway to oblivion, and not a film about the Mexican revolution. ""Dixiana"" promises to be very cool as it starts - with the circus/vaudeville settings and so on, but we very soon realize it is an unpardonable mishmash. Bebe Daniels is quite good, but that's ALL!!! Even the Technicolor sequence (actually the whole last reel) I was looking forward to anxiously turned out to be a complete waste of good celluloid - one of the most idiotic dance routines ever choreographed with costumes ugly as a whore's dream and dance girls from hell (they are from the worst kennel). The flick itself is presented in a perfectly good condition, the sound and colours being top quality. Too bad the ones who made this miserable epic didn't put more into it. But at least this one pretty much explains why the musicals were out in the early thirties - too much BS was being turned out and hadn't B.Berksley saved the industry, God knows what might have been!",1057881600,3,1199,4.882352941176471
1332641,1,B00003RQOK,"Wheeler and Woolsey supposedly saved the RKO studios in the early 30's, so I was interested in seeing what this early comedy team was all about. Well, what they were about is a very stale, crude, wooden vaudeville comedy duo act. Do NOT expect Burns and Allen. These two guys were awful. One guy is tall, wears glasses, and does nothing but pull a cigar in and out of his ugly mouth while he barks out the lamest lines you can imagine. The other guy is a short, somewhat wimpy/effeminate, guy with a whiny voice who doesn't do anything but stand close to the other guy. It was a pretty dismal routine. The film itself is of no interest to anyone but those obsessives who need to see it for the early technicolor sequence (wasted on a lame dance act and one of Bill Robinson's least inspired tap routines). The plot has something to do with plantations, freed slaves, music halls, practical jokes, searching for a bride, and dancing. I couldn't figure it out, but since it wasn't 'Showboat"", I figured it wasn't worth trying to. I love old movies but this is scraping the very bottom of the lowest barrel.",1045353600,2,1104,4.497512437810945

7919351,4,B00003RQOK,"The DVD cover art for this early Wheeler & Woolsey musical comedy is a bit misleading; Bebe Daniels has top billing over the boys, as they are clearly in supporting roles as comedy leads. The comedy team would get their chance starring in their own vehicles shortly after, beginning with ""Half Shot at Sunrise"". As one of many stage productions adapted to screen during the early talkie era, it's a pleasant slice of 1800's New Orleans hospitality as Daniels plays the title character Dixiana, an enchanting entertainer introduced into high-brow Orleans society, but harboring a checkered past as a circus star (yes, there was a great deal of prejudice & condescension towards ""showbiz folk"" back then, apparently). This web of deceit, misunderstandings & star-crossed romance builds to a frothy climax (typical of early 1930's productions).
The Wizard of Oz-like switch from black & white to technicolor is something really to behold, considering this was only 1930.
So the question remains: Are W&W funny? Well, being a musical comedy, they are forced to share screen time with the many gargantuan musical numbers, so they're appearances are few & far between. But the dueling bit is elaborate & funny. And the running gag about the ""cigar game"" is good for several chuckles. But in my opinion, W&W would be shown to greater advantage in their starring vehicles. In other words, the best was yet to come.
Still, whether your a W&W fan or a fan of early 30's musicals, you'll find this one satisfying!",1388793600,,1502,4.964285714285714
