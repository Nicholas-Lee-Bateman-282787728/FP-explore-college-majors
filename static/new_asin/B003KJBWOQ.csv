8398723,5,B003KJBWOQ,"There is not a single DVD that Sandra has put out that I have not liked. From beginner to advanced doesn't matter. I use her DVD's as practice guides, to help me be a better instructor, to help me perfect my technique, and for inspiration in choreography.
Sandra is great at breaking down a move giving great detail to technique. She is thorough and engaging. I always learn a lot from her videos and use them constantly. They will never collect dust in my house! She is fabulous!",1368748800,3,480,4.465909090909091
8398724,5,B003KJBWOQ,Mala is right on the money with her great review. I recently purchased this dvd over the holidays. I always look to cheeky girls production for bellydance dvds. Based on Mala's review I am very happy with this dvd. Sandra is a great teacher and I love the music by Hossam Ramzy. I would recommend this dvd to anyone looking to spice up there bellydancing with a veil intro and great combinations. I can't wait for Sandra to make more dvds.,1294704000,,439,4.432098765432099
8398725,5,B003KJBWOQ,"On Volume 3 of Belly by Sandra, we have a classic choreography set to an edited version of Faddah by Hossam Ramsy. The piece has varied rhythm and pace. The choreography really isn't a beginner level one, which is why I felt it should not have followed as Volume 3 after the 1 and 2 set of belly dance basics. There are many movements such as the pivot turn and other footwork, not taken up on the two basic volumes, so why should there be a connection at all. I nitpick about names and volumes only because later down the line, this does influence buying decisions. For those who know it's coming and are waiting eagerly, the names don't matter a bit.

The instruction also moves along at a good pace, which may be a tiny bit too fast for the absolute beginner.  Of course, if you're an ambitious beginner, there's no reason why you shouldn't work with it - and no harm either.

The whole choreography is taught in Breakdown and Practice sections with several repetitions to music for the practice part. Here I think that calling out the moves - very minimally - would really help because there are often three steps to learning: breakdown, explanation, tips etc, a try-out with music and cues, and finally progress to dancing along with the music. After each segment you also have a ""From the Top"" section which I think is very useful indeed. I wish all choreography videos would follow this.

The entrance is a short veil piece for which Sandra does show you what you're supposed to do with the veil, but the instruction moves on and you would obviously do a better job if you already know just the veil basics. If you're an absolute beginner, you'll be busy wondering how to hold the viel in the first place, let alone how to move it around. The veil segment is simple and pretty.

Section 2 moves on to shedding the veil and moving on to snake arms and arms overhead. It's a short part and very effective and attractive, with a nice lifted posture marking it. The third section goes into a kanun section and the moves get into shimmies. By itself, again it's an easy and effective chunk. I see myself using these sections in improvisation as well.

Section 4 has a medium pace and uses the undulation drop to the floor shown in Volume 2. It's an elegant section beginning with the undulation and ending with a lovely arm sweep down over one leg. I like her arabesque poses and lifted upper body and arms. Oh, the arm work is just right for the moves it accompanies - not too busy, not too quiet. And yes, doing this choreography should teach a thing or two about arm work if you like nice sweeping expansive arm moves.

Section 5 goes into Saidi. It contrasts with the previous sections and goes bouncy with the familiar down-up down-down-up hip drops. Section 6 transitions on to the exit. It's faster, accent-filled. Sandra uses big twists, ab locks, snake arms, hip pushes and large hip circle with a deep lean. Section 7 repeats twice and prepares to end the piece. She uses the  shimmy, chase, turns and various nuances that must be got right to get the look Sandra has for this piece.

Section 8 is the finale and is full of turns and the final pose. But there are also nuances and details and tucks and undulations. By now we have definitely moved out of beginner territory.

The performance involves some modifications - which is a good thing. You have a run-through of the full choreography anyway, so adjustments and changes needed when you have a live audience is a good idea. You will find this modified performance on By Dancers for Dancers Vol II.",1275523200,9,3566,4.514728682170543
