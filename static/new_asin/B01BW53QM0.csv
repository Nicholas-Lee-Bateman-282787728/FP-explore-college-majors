8751694,5,B01BW53QM0,Great DVD. Big fan of this director. Some great stuff selected for this one. The soundtrack (while not a genre of music that I seek out) is really good and fits well. I recommend this one.,1512604800,,188,4.25
8751695,3,B01BW53QM0,"If you go in expecting something like Orozco The Embalmer you might be surprised. Once I heard that the newest film from infamous Shockumentary director Tsurisaki Kiyotaka was getting a U.S. DVD release I was excited to see what taboo breaking subject matter Mr. Kiyotaka would cover next. Needless to say I'm a bit disappointed in it. This project was made in collaboration with the Japanese Doom Metal group The Corrupted, a group I was unfamiliar with basically its not a documentary as much as it is a 73 minute long Doom Metal music video featuring images of war, poverty, drug use, religion and death. That is all the film is, and while the music was great and the imagery was fantastic it just lacks any real substance, message or even the simplest things like subtitles or context which is the film's biggest crime, I'm sure the film would have been far more interesting or disturbing if there would have been some text on the screen explaining what we as the viewers are seeing or what is being said in the scenes or in the song (which is literally a 73 minute long song) that plays in the background the entire time. Overall I liked the film but I wish it had more depth.",1466467200,,1181,4.5233644859813085
