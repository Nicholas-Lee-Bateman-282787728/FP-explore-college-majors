3945856,3,B002LFJXM8,"I received the ""Megabox"" yesterday, and have just started viewing it. So, this review just covers vol. 1. The first DVD contains various interviews with MJ (Oprah's interview, Sylvia Chase's, etc). Most are readily available on youtube, but this collection does bring them together in one place. That's the one advantage of the collection.

  The picture and sound quality vary. Some have exceedingly poor sound and visual quality--obviously transferred from an old video. But it does make interesting viewing for MJ fans if you can put up with the sketchy quality.

The 32-page booklet is nothing special--very flimsy paper quality--just an overview of his career with a few good pictures.

  It will be interesting to see what's on the other DVD's. The booklet should have contained a contents listing for the entire set.",1258502400,5,823,5.142857142857143
3945857,1,B002LFJXM8,"If you click on the enlarge picture option, towards the bottom it states: "" These programmes contain no music by the artist. ""  This is why there is no content description on this product, because if it contains no music by the artist it can't be a legit MJ release. The product description does indicate that it is in english, but I have a hard time believing that by the way the banner is written on the front of the picture. Buyers Beware! Sounds like a scam!",1257811200,5,462,4.310344827586207
3945858,1,B002LFJXM8,"Hi all you Michael Jackson fans out there.  I also keep getting e-mails about ""new"" Michael Jackson products.  The same songs and videos are being shuffled into different packaging.  If you are a long time fan, like me, there is NOTHING that you don't already have.  People are using MJ's name to cash in.  Unless they release previously unreleased material in a new product, hold on to your hard earned cash, especially in this economy.  If you have all his albums, you have the best MJ had to give us.  I will treasure my MJ music, and listen to it often to remember him.  If you don't already have his DVD's of his live concerts, they are worth getting, especially if you have never seen him in concert before. He gave us over forty years of exceptional entertainment, but we have now come to the end of the rainbow.  His talent will never be matched, or forgotten.  If you really feel the need to spend your cash, buy another copy of the Thriller album.  MJ is in line to be the first artist to gain RIAA triple diamond certification.  He is very close to this honor, and the sooner the Thriller albums sell, the sooner he can add this honor to his legacy.  I believe he has earned it, and totally deserves it.  Also, in case you don't already know, please visit The Michael Jackson Tribute Portrait website.  You can sign up for free to become part of an everlasting art project to honor ""The King"".  One million fans are needed, and so far, we're about half way there.  That is definitely worth doing.
Don't be a victim of the mass marketing ploys.  Learn about any product before buying it! I like ordering from Amizon.com.  They are very reliable, but I also agree that each product should have a full description of what it includes because that is fair to the customer. In any other store, you can see what you are buying, Amizon should let their customers have a full description so the customer can make an educated choice about their purchases.",1257811200,13,1957,4.492917847025495
3945859,1,B002LFJXM8,"I agree with the previous review - you must describe the content of the products you sell- what are these 4 dvds of? they could contain anything including crappy 'docus' that MJ fan would rather burn than buy. so please explain...
if you enlarge the picture I can at least read: 'these programmes contain no music by the artist'",1257724800,3,328,4.576271186440678
3945860,1,B002LFJXM8,"How can you people post a 5 star review for something you haven't seen? No one of these 5 star reviews have ANY idea what's on this DVD.  Just because MJ's face is on it doesn't mean it's automatically great. I agree, at a minimum Amazon should let the customer know what they are buying.  Anything less is ridiculous.",1257465600,3,318,4.372881355932203
3945861,5,B002LFJXM8,"This is probably unacceptable, but I'm putting this out there for those potential customers who are hesitant to shell out their hard earned cash (as I too am) on a product that carries no reviews...ones of us who need more information about this product.  Also, I am assigning the product a good rating although I have not viewed this product.  The following comment was lifted from one (and only) Amazon UK reviewer.  Hope it helps your buying decision regarding this product:

""Who is producing all of these spurious DVDs? Most of them look abysmal but this one takes the cake! A transcript from a seance! Are they serious?! And they have not even bothered to check the spelling. In the Product Description,'fascinating' is spelt incorrectly. I have not bought this DVD or any of the others on offer. Most of them look very amateur and I would advise anyone to think twice before parting with their hard earned cash. Wait for a genuine, professionally produced DVD to be released.""

Happy DVD shopping!!!!",1257379200,17,1007,4.8313953488372094
3945862,3,B002LFJXM8,"This DVD box has almost all of Michael Jackson's important interviews (Oprah 1993, Diane Sawyer 1995, Barbara Walters and many more), BUT because of copyright restrictions the original TV shows were cut whenever Michael's music appears (including him singing ""Who Is It"" a cappella on Oprah!). Which means: you get all the all the great interview content that fans are looking for, but not the entire original TV broadcasts. ;-(
Since this is not an official MJ product the DVD menu and image quality are halfway decent (as if you had it recorded yourself on your VHS or DVD recorder), but nowhere near a crisp and clear state of the art digital release.

GREAT for hardcore fans who want to own the footage but nothing for high quality MJ lovers.

P.S. The very interesting Martin Bashir ""Living with Michael Jackson"" film is not on this collection (only little bits from MJ's own personal camera man when Bashir was interviewing him)",1304640000,,935,4.8375
3945863,5,B002LFJXM8,I enjoyed this dvd collection because it had footage I have not ever seen or have not seen in a very long time. And it's nice that it's packaged together all together on dvd. I lot of my own Michael vhs taped footage or footage has not been transferred to DVD yet and this helps out a lot to have footage on him bundled together.,1303171200,2,329,4.076923076923077
3945864,5,B002LFJXM8,"This compilation is great.  It contains no musical content just interviews and various other sightings and clips, even a deposition.  A lot of it you can find on you tube but it was nice to watch on TV.  I am a big MJ fan and I really enjoy having it all on 4 dvds to enjoy. Be careful not to buy them separate because they do sell them separateley.  Some interviews the quality isn't that great but it is because they were filmed years ago.  What I really was happy about was the fact that the dvds contain Michael Jackson's home videos, that was exciting!  It is well worth the money.  A must for all MJ fans!",1287705600,2,611,4.170940170940171
3945865,4,B002LFJXM8,This was a good collection but some of it was just too drawm out... The interviews and court room footage was good stuff I'd never viewed before but the cd signings were so long! LOL! Thank God for the few ppl who made it an unforgettable experience! If you are a fan you will like this... hopefully! I did. :-),1282780800,,311,4.2
3945866,5,B002LFJXM8,"I want to clear up the bad reviews on this. I mean I loved it, and I'll tell you why. But first I want to comment on the negative feedback on here, first I would recommend doing your homework, not much...all you have to do is read, this (Mega Box) as well as just about every other DVD out there of MJ,(EXCLUDING ""This Is It"", Dangerous Tour ""Bucharest"" and the 3 DVD's of his videos(Dangerous Short Films and HIStory volumes 1 and 2), IS NOT A COMMERCIAL RELEASE, IT IS NOT TOP QUALITY, how people don't know that when they order...I don't know. I have plenty of MJ DVD's that are I guess you would call ""bootleg"" or something, anyhow they are poor quality and sound. The MEGA BOX is one of the best ones I have as far as the quality of it. NOW ON TO MY REVIEW. I don't know if its a fan or what that does all these DVDs, whoever it is I appreciate it VERY MUCH, bottom line you see MJ you hear MJ you see his secruity, how crazy it was when he went someplace, how nuts the fans are, a glimpse of how he was, how shy he was in 1979 in an interview compared to how he may be 20 years later in an interview. To me 3 of his most famous interviews (Oprah, Barbara, and Diane) I desperately wanted to see,not to mention have in my collection. These orginally aired when I was a young child, so I didn't care about a boring Barbara Walters interview with him, I was interested in his videos and dance. But now I treasure it and just think ""wow"" and I am so glad I have it to watch anytime now. AND because its NOT his music the quality doesnt matter to me much. But when he's dancing I def perfer it to be clear. And like I said compared to alot of others that are out there (that is NOT an offical release) the quality of this is one of the better ones. I would think any especially 'hardcore' Michael Jackson fan would love this! And I highly recommend it!!! The only part thats not really entertainable is the last frame of 1 of the dvd's when he's in court (1993) its pretty long, and its a tad funny, cause I believe that MJ was trying to see how far he could push one of the attorneys, but AFTER he does his Beatboxing, I would skip ahead.",1278892800,7,2140,4.061465721040189
3945867,5,B002LFJXM8,Everything I receive about Michael is awesome.  It has interviews in it that I have never seen before.,1275264000,,102,4.666666666666667
3945868,3,B002LFJXM8,"I enjoyed a lot of the video's, but too much of it left me sad and/or mad! I will probably never watch them again.  It hurts too much to see how he was viewed and treated by people that never took the time to learn the truth about this great Artist and Humanitarian.  He deserved so much more.  His music CD's and DVD's will forever fill my home with his ""presence""!  Love him.",1273968000,,377,4.123287671232877
3945869,5,B002LFJXM8,"Anyone that loves Michael Jackson as much as I do would NOT be disappointed in owning this.
I bought this because I am looking for anything and everything that is moderate to high quality picture involving MJ. I like probably most of Mj's fans am interested in owning footage of his Home Video's, Interviews, Making-of documentaries, anything that allows me to have a legit glimpse of Michael. This had those things. Not the best quality so be prepared but, honestly good enough for me and any other devoted MJ fan.  I give credit to the fans that produced this.. because they know what MJ's fans want.",1273708800,2,602,4.679245283018868
3945870,5,B002LFJXM8,"I watched the Michael Jackson - Mega Box set and I loved it. It has a lot of interviews and footage of Michael that I would usually watch on youtube, but you never get the full effect like watching it on your t.v. This is not a documentary on Michael Jackson just a compilation of interviews, fan footage, and signings. Only thing I didn't like was that they added a transcript where Michael supposedly spoke from the dead, which I thought was a bit much and so unnecessary...The quality of ""some"" of the footage is not as clear as you'd like it to be as I read before on other reviews before purchasing this product but you can still tell its Michael and see his face...for me I didn't think it was that bad. Some of the videos that are in this dvd set can be found on youtube...the quality looks about the same, just in case anyone wants to see and get an idea how it would look before they purchase it. I am a BIG Michael Jackson fan so I am very glad that I purchased this product...I am very happy with it.",1272844800,3,1011,4.18974358974359
3945871,5,B002LFJXM8,"If you are a true Jackson 5/Michael Jackson fan as I am than this mega box is for you.  What true fan would not want to see continous coverage of Michael Jackson.

The first CD offers you continous footage of Michael as he travels the world as seen through the eyes of his fans recording his every move.  The second one offers you footage of Michael being interviewed starting from when he was with the Jackson 5 and through out his career.

I believe they must have included every interview Michael ever had.  They even included the ones he had with Ophrah Winfrey and Dianne Sawyer.  I would encourage anyone who has started collecting footage of Michael to add this mega box to their collection.

I just wished It covered MJ at Virgin Megastore from the time he arrived to the time he left but for all what I did get I am so grateful!! This is as up close and personal I could ever get of MJ and I am very pleased! I hope that who ever put this DVD together I hope there is more of MJ fotage like this left in an archive somewhere to have a Video Mega Box Set II or 2! Thank you so much for the gift of MJ Personally I can't  stop loving MJ and I can't stop playing all these videos!!!!",1270684800,5,645,3.8496240601503757

3945874,3,B002LFJXM8,"I read that this DVD includes footage of the memorial service, which is not true. And if this DVD mega box set is for the fans, why on God's earth would the maker of this DVD set add such sad and horrific footage as MJ dealing with oral surgery and dealing with answering questions in a deposition which incidentally was also cut off short. Hours of agony. No wonder he took drugs to deal with is pain. People drove him to his death. On a lighter note, the younger days with his home and family history in Indiana and other states ( I think ALabama) was great. Loved to see his family's lifestyle outside of Hollywood.",1267488000,,618,4.336206896551724
3945875,1,B002LFJXM8,"I watch all the DVDs in this box. For the interview part, some of them like Oprah interview, 20/20 interview, the quality are OK, not good but OK. The others and the fan's footage part are just horrible. I wish I had read the comments before I brought this. It is a shame on someone who release DVD like this. I'm not joking, my eyes feel pain after watching this. Hardly to see Michael while the camera apparently shake all the time and Michael was surround by the bodyguards and crowd. The footage was nasty even you can see him. We can see all these on youtube, the footage on youtube even better than these. It is odious how people wanted to dig money from MJ fans and throw us with garbage like this. Don't waste your money. It's not worth a penny.",1266451200,8,753,4.2727272727272725
3945876,5,B002LFJXM8,"I like this mega box set, what a good addition to my MJ collection. I enjoy seeing the home videos of Michael having good times with his family and friends, especially playing at pool, it's funny! I'd like to see his happy face,so sweet and pure! We can see different stages of MJ from the 4 DVDs (10.5 hours). He's a truly  genius and superstar! Re the deposition, I felt sad seeing Michael was questioned for hours, he looked exhausted and fidgety. RIP. His music will live forever!",1265932800,2,484,4.5

The local customs hasn't contacted me and I've already paid my credit card for this product.  What explanation can you give me?",1265846400,,299,4.823529411764706
3945878,5,B002LFJXM8,"I really enjoy this! If you are a fan of michaels and can't get enough of him, and love to see the (real) MJ, this is for you! It has alot of different footage of michael. Some of it wasn't the greatest of quality (mostly the older stuff), but it is worth it anyways....I love having it, I am starting a collection, someday this stuff may not be available anymore....(hopefully not) MJ should live forever!! Never forgotten!!!",1265068800,3,426,4.545454545454546
3945879,5,B002LFJXM8,"While I l love the footage, and can't seem to get enough of MJ, it seems the technical aspects could have been better.  It would have been helpful to have a menu that identifies each interview with when it was given and who conducted it.  Instead of each interview running right into the next, it would have been good to have a slight break between them.  The segment in Japan where he has the giggles (and which I love) doesn't seem to be as good quality as what you see on you-tube, even with the sound up to maximum you can barely hear it.  Do we really need to see 2 hours of a deposition where MJ is obviously uncomfortable and in pain from oral surgery?  Parts of that were interesting, but mostly it just seemed to fill up space.  All that said, most of the footage was wonderful and I hope that many of the other interviews that he's given over the years will come out soon.  I'd love to see MJ's own footage from the nasty Bashire interviews:  Living with MJ, the Footage you were Never Supposed to See, on Fox with Maury Povich; footage from the Jackson Family Awards; his Oxford Speech; the 79 Soulbeat interview; the 83 Entertainment Tonight footage; the 1977? footage with Molly Meldrum at Studio 54; the footage from the 1995 and 2000 MTV Video Music Awards; the entire Oprah intervew in 1993; MJ's Private Home Moveies:  King of Pop Up Close and Personal......etc!",1264809600,2,1379,4.46215139442231
3945880,5,B002LFJXM8,"These two (2) DVD's are a compilation of Michael Jackson's Press Conferences, Store Signings, Interviews, as well as camera footage taken by the fans.

It is exactly what I was looking for to remember the REAL Michael Jackson and not the inaccuracies that the news media distributes.

Thank you Amazon for making this product available to all Michael Jackson fans.

May he finally Rest In Peace!",1264291200,,395,4.954545454545454
3945881,5,B002LFJXM8,"I haven't received my Mega Box set just yet, but I wanted to give a special thank you to ""Dani Girl"" and ""Patricia Gabriel"" for their very descriptive reviews.  Thanks to you others as well.  (Even to the 'haters' because it helps to know the flaws so you know what to expect).

I have been an MJ fan most of my life (I'm 56). I can remember exactly where I was when I first heard ""I want you back"".  I told my mom and my sisters, ""this kid is going to be around forever"".

I guess I thought he really would always be here. But sadly, that has not happened.  I miss him. I miss his smile, his giggle...just knowing he was still around. And now I find myself searching for those interviews and clips that we've all seen just so I can see him again.  I'm glad someone saved them, and is sharing them with all of us grieving fans.

So once again, thank you to those of you who have bothered to do reviews.  They are always very helpful.

P.S.  [...] is another place where you can find vintage Jackson and MJ stuff that you can't find here.

3945882,5,B002LFJXM8,The Michael Jackson Mega box is a must have for Michael Jackson fans. I have watched the DVD's several times and will watch them again and again. They give a real insight to who Michael Jackson was as a human being not just a superstar.,1262908800,3,236,4.266666666666667
3945883,3,B002LFJXM8,"This is a two disc set without an accurate, detailed description. Box one is an assortment of home movies and interviews rolled together without being in chronologic or any other type of order. Box 2 is a series of stills taken by the fans and crowds.  Very open, but it's like watching your neighbors home movies out of sequence. This is good for viewing Michael as the shy and creative young man he was.",1262822400,,405,4.472972972972973
3945884,4,B002LFJXM8,"I was really looking forward to receiving this purchase, but the first time I had received it there was audio and visual problems, I could not see Michaels face on several of his interviews. Amazon was gracious enough to replace my box set, however some problems have been fixed where as other problems still exist. for instance michaels interview along side latoya, I can not see his face and he was so cute during this interview. I know it can be cleaned up because I have watched it on utube. I enjoyed his interviews with Oprah, and of course Barbara, and Diane Sawyer. Just listening to michael speak melts my heart, these interviews show me how callious these jouralist were during those times. And Of course the fan's pictures showing michael in various locations, I really enjoyed the opportunity to watch this in action. I love the Japan interview with him laughing, Michael has such a beautiful laugh it is from his soul. I learned about his lawsuit on songs he has written or sung on one of his interviews in this box set, this was interesting to me because the songs they were talking about were big hits, for instance ""heal the world"", "" the girl is mine"" and ""thriller"" what he had to endure while proving how he wrote songs and put them into a tape recorder, this man was a genius. This interview doesn't get old to me, because I am watching a genius at work coming up with how he write his songs and composite them into music. Incrediable. But it you get cut off and wondering the end of this lawsuit. I have to say honestly I enjoy this mega box set, but I feel they had through it together to sell in michael name. I believe when it comes to spending money on these types of things there should be quality, and not just thrown together to say here it is this is michael jackson. I knew that obvious that I couldn't replace it a third time because you don't know what kind of shape it would be in. I would be cautious when it comes to spending your money on anything michael jackson, because somebody doesn't care about the comsumers. I enjoy what I can hear and watch when it comes to MJ-I feel a little closer to an incrediable genius.",1261353600,2,2154,4.414572864321608

If you look at this article this means that you are probably really interested into buying this product, maybe as much as I was when I ordered it ?!!!
And I did receive it. First thing I did was put it into my player and then.......... I saw the quality of the videos !
I can't believe this whole box is sold with the 4 dvds in such a BAD QUALITY, sometimes we even have a hard time seeing the details on Michael's face. The image is soooo critical, grainy and fuzzy, it's horrible !
I just don't understand how there can be dvds like these on sale. I saw a few of the interviews on this box before, and the quality wasn't so nasty. How can this be possible ??
It looks like since MJ's death, too many people take advantage of the situation to make money saling anything and everything they can think of..., and this is just a real shame !...
If you love Michael Jackson as I do, you might just buy this product anyway, but I thought it would be good for you to know about the quality before being really surprised yourself !...

3945888,5,B002LFJXM8,"this mega-box set comes in a case with 4 discs in it - there are two disc holders with two discs in each. they each have the great pictures that these discs have as singles if you choose to purchase them as such instead of the mega-box whole set. it does work out better financially though to get the mega-box set rather than getting each of these dvd's by themselves. the only two differences in purchasing this box-set over the singles is that -

1. in the box-set, you get the booklet coming with the product which has a picture of mj with a crown on his head on the front cover, followed by a talk about his life, a detailing of the memorial service, some tributes, absolutely phenominal pictures, a small section celebrating his awards, and a seance (which is less than a page long)

2. it is far more affordable to purchase this mega-box set rather than get each dvd by itself.

i gave a review of all the dvd's included in this set in their individual places, so i will not copy that again in this over-all review, but what i will say is - this is a definite must-buy for everyone!! i HIGHLY recommend it. all these dvd's are phenominal!!",1259366400,4,1145,4.341121495327103
3945889,5,B002LFJXM8,"Hey Guys...I know that you have all been wondering what this product contains.  I will give you the heads up.  It is great.  It comes with 4 dvd's.  The first two dvd's contain interview all through Michael's life.  It is an unauthorized dvd set, but it is wonderful.  On the first disc it shows Michael when he was about 9 or 10 in an interview with Jackie..Then it cuts to home movies of him in around 1984 with sister Latoya.  Grant it some of the video quality is not the best, but you have to remember this was the 80's on a home video camera.  Also, the first disc has the interview he did with Oprah Winfrey in 1993.  Then there is the interview with Babara Walter's in 1997.  On the second disc you have the interview with Diane Sawyer...when he and Lisa Marie Presley were interviewed.  All these interview's look like they came from fan footage that was taped, but at least we now have all of these interview's in a few disc that we can cherish and watch Michael.  Also there are Michael's interviews/ home movies from 2003 after the Martin Bashir interview.  The video show's the entire true portion from when he talked w/ Martin Bashir caught on Michael's camera's the stuff that Martin Bashir left out of his interview.  I have not gotten past the rest, but I am sure the rest will be great.  Again...if you love Michael Jackson and want to see this man in his fullest and truest self then you will love this box set even though the quality isn't the best on all of the interviews.  I hope this helps for any buyers wanting some info.",1258848000,9,1547,4.375438596491228
3945890,3,B002LFJXM8,"Volume one was pretty good. At least positive Michael interviews.  The second is a great disappointment. Most of the 2nd volume is a deposition of a suit filed against Michael. It is just him answering questions about songs he wrote. He is exhausted from a concert the night before and the attorneys are asking these repetitive questions.  This goes on for hours and Michael is extremely patient, but obviously very tired and having a hard time concentrating. But that isn't the main problem with the video. It is advertised as an INTERVIEW and it isn't.  I feel cheated. It surprised me that others were not frustrated about that. I'm sure the other cd's labeled interviews volume 1 and 2 is the same thing as the Mega Box.  I haven't seen the rest of it yet, but sneaking a deposition in and calling it an interview was a great disappointment.",1258588800,5,845,4.651006711409396

I love Amazon, but here lately, everything on MJ seems to be a secret!!!  So, if anyone has seen this, will you please leave a review and let the rest of us know what it's all about???
Thanks!",1258588800,,352,3.861111111111111
