If that is what you're after, then this will do. The 2nd half of the 2nd dvd gets into some drills that anyone can come up on their own. Nothing new, nothing different and a whole lot of fluff.",1275350400,,347,4.1940298507462686
8018384,3,B0001YJEY8,"He covers a little of everything but so briefly I don't think you can really learn much from this.

Better would be to get a DVD of great goals form the World Cup and the English Premier league and see how they do it.",1124150400,,217,3.9318181818181817
8018385,5,B0001YJEY8,"Disk 1 is actually just a selection of goal footage from the EPL.  The commentary is very helpful and explains the concepts well.  All the goals are shown from multiple angles, and there's at least two goals per concept.

Disk 2 is a training program.  The program gives you drills that you can do with just one partner for each of the following:

-finishing with the inside of the foot

-long range shooting

-bending balls

-connecting with crosses

-near post runs

-diagonal runs

-breakaways

-1v1 facing the goal

-back to goal

There are also several goalscoring small sided games.  The program seems pretty solid, however, it assumes that the player is technically proficient and knows how to execute all of the techniques.  It merely helps you implement what you already have to play striker.

I would recommend a good dribbling/footwork video in addition to this DVD set.",1119139200,18,881,4.884353741496598
8018386,5,B0001YJEY8,"This is a wonderful investment for both coaches and the strikers themselves. When I played soccer as an adult, I played defence, but when I joined a new team, I suddenly was sent up top.  I was a comfortable playing as a striker as one sitting on a hot plate.  I had plyed in 6 matches and scored only two goals. Enter Striker School DVD. I watched this DVD everyday when I got home from work (5 times)imbibing every detail it presented. from the next Sunday on, I scored atleast 1 goal in a game.  Even when my team lost 3-2 I scored both goals.  Everyone noticed a huge change in my game.  That DVD makes every striker wannabe hungry to score, which is how every good striker should be.  Follow the teachings, and with practice your game will only get better.  I know mine did!",1101168000,14,779,4.294520547945205
