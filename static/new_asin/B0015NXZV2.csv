8259217,2,B0015NXZV2,It is not A bad routine but not nearly as funny as his happy wife happy life performance. This says V1 and V2 which I thought meant it had both the banana dvds. It doesn't just the one dvd. But I still don't regret my purchase.,1521244800,,227,3.9565217391304346

8259219,5,B0015NXZV2,Jeff Allen is hilarious.  His video has a wonderful ending!  I know you will enjoy this just as I did.,1364601600,,102,4.05
8259220,5,B0015NXZV2,"Jeff's comedy about his life will not only cause you to laugh out loud, but it will encourage you to see the honest testimony of this man before meeting Christ as well as after. There is even an interview with he and his wife included. It is much more than a comedy video. I would encourage anyone who loves to laugh as well as those who are struggling in their marriage to purchase this package. It is something that will show you the hope that comes in Christ and the transformation He can do in a life.",1318291200,,505,4.216494845360825
