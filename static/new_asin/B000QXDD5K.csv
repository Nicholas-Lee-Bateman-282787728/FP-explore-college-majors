2851176,3,B000QXDD5K,"First, the plot is weak.  Second, the whipping scenes in the prison are kind of play.  Third, a lot of naked women scenes.
But no hardcore sex.  Fourth, the extra is the worst to me.  The Director during the interview is in very bad shape and taste.
Guess what?  White beard and toothless.

This movie is about erotic human bodies.  Girls do the job.  Director kills appetite or motive.",1389398400,,386,4.492753623188406
2851177,3,B000QXDD5K,"WOMEN BEHIND BARS opens w/ a trio of masked thieves committing a robbery. One of them murders the other two, and takes a case that supposedly holds millions of dollars worth of diamonds w/ him. He meets up w/ his girlfriend, named Shirley Fields (Lina Romay), who shoots him dead! Enter a man named Milton, out to recover the stolen diamonds. He tracks Shirley to a maximum security women's prison. Milton watches through binoculars as the story in the prison unfolds. He eventually visits Shirley, but who really cares about him anyway? The ""warden"" of the posh penitentiary, in his black turtleneck, looks sort of like a beatnik version of Tom Savini. He's the standard pervert, out to ""help"" the inmates as often as he possibly can. Of course, this is a Jess Franco film, so the female inmates are all beautiful, and constantly looking for excuses to shed their burdensome clothes. Not that there's all that much clothing to begin with! The prison uniforms consist of long shirts w/ no pants, and high heels! There is the obligatory torture to accentuate the rampant nudity. The merciless warden likes to watch the whippings like the heinous ghoul he is! He's downright giddy when Shirley is chained to the terrible ""hot seat"". Yikes! There are plenty of adult situations that give Mr. Franco ample excuse to... um, zoom in. Though dull and talky in many spots, WBB is still better than Franco's 99 WOMEN (aka: ISLAND OF DESPAIR). The finale, where Shirley turns the tables, isn't bad at all...",1374537600,7,1497,4.8062015503875966
