This film completely resonated with me and desire of the soul to be free. In my top five movies of all time. Where can I get it?",1228089600,4,248,4.533333333333333
7940921,5,B00005JOBH,"I saw this film in a theater in Germany in 1983 and never forgot it. It delivers an intense experience of questioning, trial, search, fulfillment, mastery and confusion. Much like real life, only more concentrated. You'll never look at certain hills, birds or rusted car parts in the same way. Watch it, then wait a few days and watch it again, if you can. If the DVD ever appears. I would rank this as one of the five best ever made, but bear in mind that my best-ever list would also include The Man Who Fell to Earth (Roeg), Blade Runner (director's cut, not the one with the awful voiceover), Modern Times (Chaplin), and Brazil (Gilliam).",1186444800,3,642,4.543103448275862
7940922,5,B00005JOBH,"No, it's not the animated film, but is VERY good...

I've been waiting ages to find it on DVD and hope you manage to get it out!",1146441600,2,128,3.740740740740741
7940923,3,B00005JOBH,"People are confused.  This isn't the wonderful Rene LaLoux animated French film called ""Light Years"" in America.  This is a film directed by Alain Tanner.  I'm not sure much about it.",1128211200,,183,4.838709677419355
7940924,5,B00005JOBH,this is the best animated movie i have ever seen. seriously. i don't think even fantastic voyage is as good. why this hasn't been released on dvd i could not tell you.,1120435200,,167,4.25
7940925,5,B00005JOBH,"In my view Alain Tanner's best movie, beautiful, mystic and thought-provoking. Mick Ford makes a very good job of portraying the intelligent, tousled vagabond being initiated into the big mysteries of life.",1119052800,6,206,5.46875
