4397162,1,B004KL0OWY,"The dancing is amazing but I saw this as a two part film each one lasting 90 mins - it does prove one thing though - extraordinary dancers cannot act for toffee!

One thing really annoyed me and that the dance section set on the ship - ships are made with air tight sections and all the doors have locks - so why did the victims run around the engine room and when one did go into a room - he didn't lock the door....that's just stooped.

Watch it if you love dance but avoid it if you love movies.",1363392000,,498,3.97
4397163,5,B004KL0OWY,"I really enjoyed this item because it was long awaited, the dancing in it was incredibly inspirational, I recommend it to all dance lovers out there!",1341964800,,149,4.769230769230769
4397164,5,B004KL0OWY,"I accidentally ran across the first season while going through Netflix and thought why not? I love watching people dance and I was totally blown away by the first season. I found out that there was a second and I HAD to get it so cruised through Amazon and found this. I bought it, watched it, shared it with my husband and a few friends who also thought it was really cool and I cannot WAIT for more. I really hope that LXD comes out with another season soon!",1334016000,2,460,4.179775280898877
4397165,5,B004KL0OWY,These kids are awesome!!  If only the world really dealt with issues through dance everyone might be happier.  Can't wait for season 3!!,1322179200,,136,4.869565217391305
4397166,4,B004KL0OWY,"This is it!  The perfect series about the latest dance crazes.  Volume One details the gathering of young B-boys and the like to form a sort of Justice League to help and protect mankind.  Volume Two details the gathering of the evil forces that the good guys must dance against.  Some of the most incredible, athletic, gravity-defying acrobatic dancing that you will ever see is presented in this series.  Fans of ""So You Think You Can Dance"" will have seen guest appearances of members of LXD (the League of Extraordinary Dancers).  Each episode is prefaced by a narration by a gentleman who manages to fill each syllable with deep meaning... not a small feat!  Now that the forces have gathered, it appears that Season 3 will provide some of the most unbelievable challenge-dancing to have been seen by this date.  This is the logical conclusion to the progression of dance battles that began in the days of ""Breakin'"" and ""Electric Boogaloo"".  You will not believe your eyes.  The only thing preventing a full FIVE stars is that Volume Two villains do not quite live up to the excellence of Volume One heroes.  The hope is that Volume Three will find a way to boost the bad guys to a more frightening level.",1314489600,,1211,4.665094339622642
4397167,5,B004KL0OWY,"If you haven't heard about this show, check it out now on Hulu. It's been getting buzz all over the world (literally) for its innovative approach to combining dance and action/adventure storytelling. Breakdancing/bboys are the emphasis, but we see all styles of urban dance as well as ballet, tap and contemporary. Family-friendly, hip enough for any teenager or college kid, it's a perfect mix of genres and audiences. Watch it!!!",1302566400,2,431,5.171428571428572
4397168,5,B004KL0OWY,"I watched all both seasons online, and absolutely loved it. Honestly, i never expected to like anything dance-related...but damn it, this thing is awesome. especially Robot Love Story. The way they choreograph that chapter and mix in a Repo! the Genetic Opera feel is spectacular!

if any one has dabbled in this a bit and didn't like it, watch the last five episodes of season one AT LEAST.",1296691200,6,391,4.75

8433082,5,B004KL0OWY,It's like if someone took the Plot Line and atmosphere of Heroes but required all the superheroes to have incredible dance moves.  It's terrific.,1498176000,,145,5.041666666666667
8433083,5,B004KL0OWY,Came in super fast and absolutely love this series /movie,1437609600,,57,4.8
8433084,3,B004KL0OWY,The dancing is great but the  acting and plot are terrible,1426118400,,58,4.2727272727272725
8433085,4,B004KL0OWY,I like it and I received this DVD in a timely manner. I am happy that I bought it and hopefully they come out with Season 3 on DVD.,1395792000,,131,3.5517241379310347
8433086,5,B004KL0OWY,What's not to love about these extraordinary dancers and the creative director who's vision it is. Genius and totally original. I'm glad to see their influence on mainstream dance now especially Christopher Scott.,1389225600,,213,5.484848484848484
8433087,5,B004KL0OWY,"I love the LXD, have been a fan for years, watching on youtube only has select few so I had to buy the dvds. Thank you. Shipping was fast and arrived in excellent condition.",1377475200,,173,4.117647058823529
8433088,5,B004KL0OWY,Very interesting stories. I really appreciated the imagery. Very entertaining and visually stimulating. Good buy. I first saw this on Netflix but it is not there anymore. Now that I own it I can watch it whenever,1372204800,,212,4.756756756756757
8433089,3,B004KL0OWY,"Based on the people that are in the movie, I expected a bit more than what I got.  The way it ended you would think there would be a third installment to it, but not yet that I know of.  If you like dancing in general then there are parts that will be good but if you are looking for something a bit deeper you won't find it here.",1371772800,,330,3.7681159420289854
8433090,4,B004KL0OWY,The concept was extremely well executed and left me wishing for the continuation. It was a true exposition of the story and the dance.,1369612800,,134,4.625
