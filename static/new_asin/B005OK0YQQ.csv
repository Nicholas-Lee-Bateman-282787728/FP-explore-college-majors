4852332,5,B005OK0YQQ,This Boston Blackie video is highly entertaining and more on the lighter side of crime.  I recommend the contact for this video very highly.  Enjoy!!!!,1339718400,,151,5.0
4852333,5,B005OK0YQQ,"After viewing these some years back I was pleased to see one released and I had to order I was not disappointed the quality was great and the action was fun,release them all I say. It was an hour of easy going fun.",1335312000,5,214,4.0
4852334,5,B005OK0YQQ,I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE BOUGHT THROUGH AMAZON BECAUSE OF THE NOSTALGIA. I USED TO WATCH BOSTON BLACKIE MOVIES WHEN I WAS A KID.  THE SCENERIES AND THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE  BROUGHT BACK NICE MEMORIES OF THE OLD DAYS.,1331424000,8,221,4.5
4852335,4,B005OK0YQQ,"It is wonderful to see Boston Blackie available officially and with a great print as well.

This was the fourteenth and last in the series, but I am encouraged that Sony may release the rest of the series soon.  Bootleg DVDs do not do justice to these little gems which feature Chester Morris as Boston Blackie, who keeps the story going with a touch of adventure and comedy rolled into one.

Solving a murder and stolen gems racket, are only part of the plot as Blackie has to also keep from the clutches of Inspector Faraday, who likes to arrest Blackie on any pretext.

Overall 59 minutes well spent.  Thanks to Sony for finding such pristine source material and providing a great DVD transfer. P{lease release the rest of the series soon.",1322092800,26,742,4.590909090909091

8481289,4,B005OK0YQQ,"Not bad little crime caper on the lighter side.  Boston Blackie, a reformed jewel thief (or something of that nature) is suspected yet again of thievery and murder.  This time the goings-on take place in Chinatown.  The transfer is fine.  The Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD-R is excellent quality.  The DVD-R has absolutely no extras.  Goes right into the movie.  Other than that recommended for fans of the genre.",1524355200,,420,5.0
8481290,4,B005OK0YQQ,This is a wonderful Film Noir and I enjoyed watching it.  The quality of the film was amazing considering it was made in 1949.,1517875200,,126,4.25
8481291,5,B005OK0YQQ,"again, another good boston blackie story.  Love these old movies",1484524800,,64,5.4
8481292,5,B005OK0YQQ,I recently purchased the Boston Blackie's books and I really enjoy reading them.,1478131200,,80,5.230769230769231
8481293,5,B005OK0YQQ,The DVD was very good.,1467504000,,22,3.6
8481294,5,B005OK0YQQ,"I love Boston Blackie.  I listen to the radio series on XM-Radio and have been picking up the movies as I find them (I did see a set of all 14, that I probably will get).

The quality is pretty good considering - better than Alpha, so for the price, I'm satisfied.

If you like Chester Morris, and Boston Blackie in particular, this is a must have.",1421280000,,348,4.164179104477612
8481295,4,B005OK0YQQ,Light weight fun corny movie.  I enjoyed it because I was looking for a little nostalgia.  Use to listen to Boson Blackie on the radio ages ago.  Worth getting a couple more tapes of his.,1399248000,3,187,4.285714285714286
8481296,5,B005OK0YQQ,"It is wonderful to see Boston Blackie available officially and with a great print as well. the other ones that are sold as set do not do a great job of redoing then

This was the fourteenth and last in the series, but I am encouraged and hope that Sony may release the rest of the series soon. Bootleg DVDs do not do justice to these little gems which feature Chester Morris as Boston Blackie, who keeps the story going with a touch of adventure and comedy and class rolled into one.",1394668800,,483,4.25
8481297,5,B005OK0YQQ,"The Boston Blackie movies have good story lines, the law always thought he was guilty of whatever the crime was and of course he wasn't. So you follow along while Blackie tries to slove the crime and prove he didn't do it. Makes for great weekend movie time.",1380153600,,258,4.395833333333333
