8554805,5,B00ANQYHFK,"On this DVD, he explains the strengths and weaknesses of a company, what they are, and how to find them in four ways in detail through financial statements. This DVD is a great DVD to have on hand to listen to over and over because in my opinion, unless you do this every day for a living, it is a great tool to have on hand to refer to",1356998400,,336,3.8840579710144927
8554806,5,B00ANQYHFK,"In this video, you learn how to use the three financial statements - the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement - to compare certain variables to one another and calculate financial ratios. These ratios such as the quick ratio or inventory turnover ratio can tell you something about the company. It can tell you whether the company is in great shape, how efficiently it is operating, and whether it has enough cash flow to pay for its debt service. This information can be very helpful in deciding whether you want to invest in a particular company or stay away.",1355702400,,581,4.762376237623762
8554807,5,B00ANQYHFK,"This is another useful video by Mr. Skonieczny. In this video, he introduces four types of financial ratios: liquidity ratios, efficiency ratios, profitability ratios, and solvency ratios. What I like about this video is the fact that it is a video, which means I am able to see the formula of each financial ratio and the immediate application of how it is calculated by using real financial statements. On the video, he uses various visual tools such as arrows to show you exactly where he is getting the numbers from to calculate these ratios. Then, he tells what these ratios mean and how to interpret them.  I'm sure it will be very useful to use these ratios to enable me to compare different potential investments, even if the relevant companies are of different size or different industries.",1355443200,,799,4.8321167883211675
