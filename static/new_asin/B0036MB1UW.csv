Kettle bell doesn't look hard, but it is very hard because so many lunges and up and down makes you heart rate high. Overall I love this dvd, first of all, it is easy to follow even though it is hard, and my heart keeps pumping up. Especially, I like both yoga type warm-up and cool down.
I love it!",1370908800,,443,4.045454545454546
8390100,4,B0036MB1UW,"Like the title says the emphasis with this DVD is cardio. There are 3 main workouts that can be done separately or together, plus a Yoga-like warmup and cool-down. The first uses no equipment and with the warmup lasts about 33 minutes, the second is done with a 15 lb kettlebell and the third with a 10 lb kettlebell. These two sections are short, about 12 minutes, but test your endurance. There is never a break to catch your breath which keeps your heart rate up the entire time. The movements are all vertical, so up and down a lot which really works your buns and legs, but not much rotation and no ab work. While I didn't like the lengthy warmup I really enjoyed the cool-down. Overall not bad, but if I really want to work my muscles with a kbell, I use Angie Miller's Kettlebell Bootcamp.",1266969600,,796,4.385135135135135
