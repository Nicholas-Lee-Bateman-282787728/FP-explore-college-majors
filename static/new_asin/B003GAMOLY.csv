4121375,5,B003GAMOLY,"Having gone to see this movie last night, I went home and ordered the book, and signed up to be notified when the movie becomes available on Amazon. Going in to see the movie, I had looked up the details on the plot. It looked like a good movie. I was not disappointed. The main characters were great, Charlie, his brother Sam, the woman who comes into his life, all were great. After Sam dies, Charlie stops going forward with his life. He can see Sam in spirit, and spends every afternoon playing ball with him. After 5 years, a woman comes into his life and shakes up his world. He is torn between hanging onto the past,time with Sam, and getting into a relationship with her. There is a boat accident, and much more. Towards the end of the movie, it can tug on the heartstrings. The ending is great. If someone is hanging onto the past that need to be let go, this would be a movie to help it happen.
Well worth going to see, and buy for the home collection.",1280620800,38,962,4.233695652173913
4121376,3,B003GAMOLY,"""Charlie St. Cloud"" would be the love child of a Nicholas Sparks novel and an M. Night Shyamalan film, were such a thing possible. It's on the one hand a relentlessly sentimental tearjerker and on the other hand a supernatural mystery, with a throwaway plot twist added for good measure. To say this film is awful would be harsh. Still, it certainly doesn't aspire to be anything more than what it so obviously is, so seeing this movie really isn't necessary - unless, of course, you're a tweenybopper hoping to lose yourself in the dreamy recesses of Zac Efron's eyes. That may, in fact, be the only reason he was cast, since the role is so generic that any actor could have played it to more or less the same effect. I suppose it doesn't really matter; his performance is decent enough, and I'm sure he will someday be recognized as the dramatic actor he always wanted to be.

Adapted from Ben Sherwood's novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud,"" the premise is that the title character, played by Efron, gains the ability to see ghosts after surviving a car accident. One of the ghosts is his kid brother, Sam (Charlie Tahan), who unfortunately was in the car when it crashed. Every day at sunset, the two meet in a secluded spot in the woods to play catch, since, in life, Sam was a devoted Baseball fan. It's a nice idea, although the filmmakers never take full advantage of Charlie's sixth sense, not even after he gives up on college and yacht racing, stays in his seaside hometown, and becomes a cemetery groundskeeper. The details of the plot prevent me from elaborating on this, but rest assured, he doesn't see anywhere near as many dead people as you might think.

Despite his reputation as a nutcase (which is itself painfully underdeveloped), Charlie attracts the attention of local yacht enthusiast Tess Carroll (Amanda Crew), who hopes to sail around the world and tests herself by heading into rough, stormy waters. As their relationship turns romantic, Sam - or rather, his ghost - begins to worry that he will be forgotten. Tess, in turn, tells Charlie that, at some point, he has to let go. He can't let go, he tells Tess. He made Sam a promise. This, of course, will be challenged in due time, although I'm afraid I can't say any more than that.

I'm making this sound like a complete film, but the truth is that everything about ""Charlie St. Cloud"" feels oddly condensed and unfocused. It's well established, for example, that Charlie can speak to Sam's ghost, but that's about it as far as character development is concerned. Never once do we see anything resembling brotherly love - anything, at least, the goes beyond the obvious spectacle of a young man and a boy playing catch in the woods. Likewise, we don't see any real love blooming between Charlie and Tess, maybe because (1) it happens far too quickly for us to believe it, and (2) we don't know that much about either one of them. For all I know, this may be more an issue of editing than of how the screenplay was written. Whatever the case, the film is so sparse that, even when it leads to something thematically, characteristically, or structurally, there's no sense that anything has led anywhere.

Other touches, like Charlie's encounter with the paramedic who saved his life (Ray Liotta), do little more than serve as an excuse for sermonizing. I don't mind being sermonized to, but the message involved has to have some thematic significance. What this movie tells us about life, living, and letting go is ultimately so broad and disconnected from the material that it fails to resonate. It's bad enough that the paramedic just happens to be sick with cancer upon reuniting with Charlie; this isn't plot advancement, but emotional manipulation, and that never, ever works when presented so obviously. At least, it never, ever works for me. This is the kind of overwrought storytelling that keeps me at a distance from Nicholas Sparks film adaptations. It seems he has had quite an influence. Will no one learn from his mistakes?

I will give this movie credit for its cinematography, with wonderful shots of picturesque harbors, open waters, and quaint shacks filling the scenery. A sequence of Efron and Crew frolicking through a foggy, moonlit cemetery is especially memorable; what would normally be associated with the Universal horror movies of old is instead a surprisingly effective example of high romance, if not mild eroticism. The film looks so good that it's a shame more of an effort wasn't put into the plot, the tone, and the characters. ""Charlie St. Cloud,"" despite having its heart in the right place, is too sappy, too meandering, and too weak in its story. The only real draw this movie has for audiences is Zac Efron, although it may be a moot point since he's actively trying to outgrow his teen heartthrob status.",1280448000,2,4834,4.736342042755345

4121452,3,B003GAMOLY,"Charlie St. Cloud

 This is a star vehicle for current teen throb Zac Efron, a remarkably photogenic young actor.  The story is a mix of supernatural ghost stuff, heavy drama about life, death and how deal with each and a lovely love story about two attractive young people.  In spite of the schmaltzy, trite premise, the characters are engaging enough, especially Efron that the film is an overall artistic success.  Sadly, it is not a financial success.  The producers spent some $44 million to make the movie but took in only $30 million at the box office-thus far; the film is still in release.  We wonder what they spent the money on, as much of the film is shot interior dialog (cheep to film) and the exterior shots are mostly panoramas of the beautiful sea and sky around Seattle.  The writing is nothing special, nothing dazzling for the audience to ponder as in the recent Inception.  This puts the entire burden on the young shoulders of Zac Efron.  I doubt if even one of our super stars could carry the load under these conditions.
 Director Burr Steers previously managed the well received 17 Again which also starred Mr. Efron.  To his credit, he committed no blunders but also did not provide much in the way of sparkle, although the sailing scenes are adequately filmed.
 Kim Basinger has found work in a small bit as Charlies mom.  She is quickly in and out of the movie.  Ray Liotta also has a small role as the EMT tech who saves Charlies life.  He provides the best acting by a long way in the movie but he too is quickly in and then quickly gone.  Amanda Crew is Charlies love interest but she also has too little screen time, at least for me.  She is a good actress and the film would be better with more of her and less of Charlie playing catch with his dead little brother.  But I guess Director Steers saw the project as a ghost movie with a romantic hook rather than a romance with a ghost hook.  Either way, it is only a pretty good movie.
 The film does have a good message that I intend to carry out.  You should make the most of life, packing in all the joy and love that you can under all circumstances.  This pretty good movie gets a pretty good two saw blades.  The PG-13 (only one punch for violence, theme of death and separation, no graphic sex, no bad words) film runs only one hour and a half.",1470009600,,2332,4.382284382284382

Charlie St. Cloud, a rowdy high school senior, who spends his spare time competing in boat races and playing catch with his little brother, Sam. The two are inseparable despite their near 10-year age difference, and as a viewer it's hard to not become attached or nostalgic. One night when Charlie is supposed to be watching his little brother, but wants to hang out with friends instead, he decides to drop Sam off at the park to play catch when the two boys get into an accident- resulting in Sam dying. Charlie becomes depressed, mourning the loss of his little brother, ignoring the miracle that occurred in the ambulance when he was brought back to life. After losing it at the funeral, and running into a wooded area to mourn, Charlie remembers the promise he made to Sam that he would play catch with him every day to help him make the team before he headed off to college, and tosses the ball away. To his shock, the ball rolls back at his feet, and out comes Sam. Charlie realizes he has a gift, and can see those who have passed away and haven't yet crossed over into heaven. Every day for years Charlie meets Sam in the same spot, playing catch and talking about life and in order to keep Sam ""alive"" Charlie gives up on his college career and picks up a job at the cemetery as a groundskeeper. Of course this movie wouldn't be complete without a love aspect, and naturally the movie becomes intense as Charlie has to deicide between keeping Sam alive, or saving the life of the girl he loves.
This movie is perfect for the family, for a girl's night, or a night alone with some wine and a warm blanket. 10/10!",1454630400,2,1777,4.3685800604229605

4121937,5,B003GAMOLY,"This movie was way better than I expected, seriously thinking about buying it. A sad story about a man crippled by his brother's death in a car accident in which he was driving. The movie explores how Efron's character gives up his dreams to stay and protect a pledge he made to his brother. Excellent film.",1403481600,,307,4.5

4121939,3,B003GAMOLY,"The movie emphasized the rescue element as opposed to the terrible emotional quandry the protagonist (played by Zac Efron) was going through. There was also a down-playing of the supernatural, so important to the slow reveal of his hovering between two worlds due to a near-death experience. All that to say, it ain't so bad but the book is so much better (and so short it's practically a novella)--read it, preferably first.

Finally, if you Zac groupies were expecting to see a newly buffed up hunk as portrayed in the ads and trailers, almost none of those scenes made the movie's final cut.",1401667200,,594,4.766990291262136

4121942,5,B003GAMOLY,"I laughed, I cried, and at some points I was like wtf this is retarded.

4121943,5,B003GAMOLY,"I guess is this probably a girly, Hallmark type movie; which may explain why I liked it so much. I love the ""Ghosty"" aspect of it. I could watch it again.",1398384000,,154,4.0
4121944,5,B003GAMOLY,"So poignant and so sad and yet allows one to believe that there is life after death and yet again a time to say good-bye...
grief and pain, laced with guilt that means you can't allow yourself to let go and move forward and then one day, something happens and the present becomes so important that the loving from the past allows one to take the chance to have a new happiness and that is what Charlie St. Cloud had to do to make himself a part of the present and the future and say good-bye to his sad and accidental past.

4121986,3,B003GAMOLY,Touching and inspiring. Moves slow in places yet keeps you interested.  This was a good transition for Zac Efron from his HS musical days.,1383350400,,138,4.75

4122023,4,B003GAMOLY,I Loved it and Zac Efron i thought was amazing and i was totally shocked by the end but the only reason i gave it 4 stars was the people who saw it with me said it was predictable and bas but i thought it was totally awesome,1380326400,,224,3.6875
4122024,5,B003GAMOLY,I first seen this movie on one of the premium channels and instantly wanted to know what was going to happen.  It is a tear jerker so you might want to have some tissues handy.,1379203200,,176,4.0285714285714285
4122025,3,B003GAMOLY,Not bad for a chick flick. It was worth the watch. Story was a bit out there but it was entertaining,1379203200,,100,3.8095238095238093
4122026,5,B003GAMOLY,"Once upon a time there was a young man who lived in a small fishing village. Although I haven't read the book it could very well start out in the classic fashion of fairy tales as this is a charming fantasy about a young man whose life is changed by an unfortunate accident.

It is a story of love and loyalty and growing up; a story that involves life, death, and ghosts. The movie is set in a small coastal village with a dramatic coastline and beautiful forests. There is scene after scene of beauty which is a tribute to the film makers keen eye for beauty and the abundance of beautiful scenery in the setting where it was filmed in Eagle Harbour, West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

If you enjoy a romantic fairy tale fantasy then this one should be a natural for you.",1378944000,,781,4.379310344827586
4122037,5,B003GAMOLY,"Look, this is simply an enjoyable movie with a standard theme (""boy meets girl/boy saves girl""), nice looking kids and an age old plot. But it is filmed in a beautiful setting, with acting good enough to allow you to escape for a couple of hours. For that, I give it top marks!",1378771200,,277,4.245283018867925

4122040,2,B003GAMOLY,"I hesitated between 2 and 3 stars. May be I was just not the target audience of this movie. However the theme is relevant to most of us, so I don't think this was the issue. The actors are fine, the storyline is fine as well, the esthetic is more than fine, so may be it went wrong at editing. Honestly, I am not sure.",1378512000,,318,3.9076923076923076
4122041,5,B003GAMOLY,For me it is a good drama dealing with the death of a love one and the affects of that experience.  All the different aspects of changes that happens and the affects of the belief of the afterlife.  Well done and acted.,1377820800,,219,4.190476190476191
4122042,4,B003GAMOLY,"This movie was worth watching! The story was real and believable. I felt for the characters and got into the story quickly. Romantic and a little sad, Charlie St. Cloud still managed to surprise you in the end.",1376870400,,210,4.552631578947368
4122043,5,B003GAMOLY,"I love this movie especially when it's Zac playing the main role. He's a great actor, and a great person. I love watching zappy love movies; sometimes I can relate to them. I give him two thumbs up! Excellent work, Zachary !",1376092800,,224,4.357142857142857

4122045,5,B003GAMOLY,"In most movies, when someone special has died, I spend the entire movie hoping at the end, the person will be alive again. (I'm such a ""happily ever after"" movie type of person. lol  But for this movie, it was easy to just go along for the ride. And for people who have not seen this movie, I am NOT saying whether people do or do not come back to life. I'm just saying that wasn't on my mind for the entire movie. I really liked it. Zac Efron, is of course gorgeous as usual.",1375660800,,476,4.010526315789473

4122080,4,B003GAMOLY,This was a mature role for Zac Efron that was well written for both him and his supporting cast. If you're a hopeless romantic than this movie is for you.,1374019200,,154,4.166666666666667

4122084,5,B003GAMOLY,"This is a 5 star sad movie. If you love sad movies, this is it. It's so heartbreaking, sad, and depressing. This movie is slow. For me, there is already too much sadness around the world and in the news that I have to see everyday, so this is not my kind of movie. I like pick me up movies. If you love movies about death and heartbreaks, this movie is for you.",1372291200,2,361,3.958904109589041

It's cliche' & formulaic but who cares?!...troubled boy is haunted by his past, only to meet a pretty girl who helps him deal with the guilt of his little brother's death. Zac Efron and Amanda Crew aren't going to win an Academy Award for this performance but, again, who cares?  I'm a sucker for romance and I loved it...it is what it is.

4122126,5,B003GAMOLY,"The title of the movie didn't describe the content of a very good story about love.  Especially between Charlie and his brother Sam.  Another transitional movie for Zac Efron.  Think he is a good young actor and learning his skills in the world of cinema.  The movie was inspiring especially to those of us who have lost a close family member.  Realizing that love for that loved one never stops.  They are always with us in our heart, thoughts and memories.

4122145,5,B003GAMOLY,"Zac Efron did some very awesome acting in this movies, proving his acting abilities.  I felt that the movie was very subtle but yet showed some hints of things not to do in real life (such as turning the wheel while waiting for traffic).

4122178,5,B003GAMOLY,"In this movie, cutie pie Zac Efron loses his brother. He has a very hard time moving on after his death. And rightfully so, Charlie made promises that were kinda hard to keep. Anyway, the story is about him dealing with the loss of his brother and how he finally gets to move on. It makes you tear up toward the end, but it is a great lesson in how to handle death and how to get on with your life. It is ok for younger teenage daughters - no cussing, no sex, no violence. It was very well made and recommended for ages 12+. Zac not bad to look at either :)",1361836800,,557,3.938053097345133
4122179,2,B003GAMOLY,"This isn't normally the type of movie I watch. I decided to check it out though, because people have been raving about it. It also features Charlie Tahan, who is one of the biggest up and coming stars around. Charlie St. Cloud also has some awesome cameos and let's face it, Zac Efron was pretty good in 17 again, so I took a chance. Sadly though, even with all the film apparently had going for it, Charlie St. Cloud was a boring flop. The story follows a young man's journey to re-discover himself following a drunk driving accident that claimed the life of his little brother. It's a solid story to build on, but that's just it, it really doesn't go anywhere from there. Charlie is consumed by what happened and even years later spends hours in the woods talking to his brothers ghost. If you watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie, there really all there is to see. It had a lot of potential and fairly good cast, but honestly I found the film to be boring and really depressing.",1361491200,,989,4.409836065573771

4122202,5,B003GAMOLY,"Even though the story really went nowhere but thanks to the medium / small part given to Augustus Prew it was worth seeing.
Efron is good but the story falls short with the girl Prew's movie girlfriend Cindy sets him up with.
We see 1 second of her I think, but the girl Efron wants reminded me of Jennifer Love Hewitt.",1361145600,,319,4.245901639344262

4122208,4,B003GAMOLY,"I have just watched this DVD and I found it very interesting on many levels.  However I do realise that it was meant for a younger audience and now I am going to forward it to my teenage godson who has just fallen in love for the first time as I am sure that he will enjoy it much more than I.

All the actors in the movie are very charismatic ( I was surprised to see Ray Liota acting a nice part in it, as he always portrays a baddie, and it must be a nice change for him this time).  On the whole it is a pleasing movie with a moral to the story which I won't reveal for all those that intend to purchase this movie, but again I will state, that it is mainly for the young at heart or for the young in love, and viewers will not be disappointed in any way for purchasing Mr. Charlie St. Cloud and Zac Efron is very easy on the eyes as well, as any teenager will tell you.

4122210,4,B003GAMOLY,I loved this cute lovable movie. Just settle down with some pop corn and warm blanket for a two tissue night out with girl friends. Zac is lovable and should be cloned. I would recommend this move to my girl friends,1359158400,,215,4.2682926829268295
4122241,2,B003GAMOLY,Was not sure what to expect so kept an open mind. Zac I felt played his part well and the story was understandable of one finding it hard to let go of a lost one.

The lead character, played by Zac Efron, was genuine, believable and dramatic.  The scenes of the racing was exciting and made you feel like you were right in the middle of the race.  The twist was shocking at first, mysterious later, and resolved with will power by each character.  Zac is the brother that everyone trys to aspire to.

4122275,4,B003GAMOLY,"I thought that this was a great film.  One gets tired of blood and gore after awhile and it is refreshing to just lose yourself into a fantasy that ends well for a change.  I thought Amanda Crew was outstanding, even though the film was supposed to revolve around Zac and his brother I do not think that it would have worked at all without her.  She showed emotion but did not overdo it...whereas I thought Efron except in one place did not show hardly any emotion.  Now maybe this was the idea of the film that he was wounded by the loss of his brother and therefor ""numb"" to life .
There were ""holes "" in the film also.  After a brief part for Zacs mother she disappears from the film as does
Tess's mother.  I just think that part was unrealistic and left kind of an empty spot.

It was a very good story and....I would sail off into the sunset with Amenda anytime.",1355875200,,868,4.192771084337349

He's good and I will most likely buy other movies he is staring in.",1355616000,,338,4.265625
4122279,4,B003GAMOLY,"MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)

Sometimes you have to steer clear of the crowd, and with Charlie St. Cloud (2010), that's what I have to do. While both moviegoers and film critics generally panned this movie, I think they missed the mark on this one. While it may not be edgy or completely original, both its star Zac Efron and the film try to go places that so few movies dare to. To some degree, Charlie St. Cloud is like Field of Dreams (1989). You have to buy into it's nearly ludicrous concept of the story being told in both the real world and in another world, namely purgatory or some other realm where the spirits of dead people come to life. I'm not really giving anything away because the concept is right there in the trailer and early on in the movie.

Director Burr Steers had a challenging job bringing this story to the screen, but I think he assembled a good cast and a good team to execute his vision. It's been awhile since we've since Kim Basinger on screen in anything significant. Her role as Charlie's mother is slight, but I enjoyed what little we got of her. Augustus Prew plays a fun sidekick character, and I liked Charlie Tahan as the younger St. Cloud brother, Sam. Rounding out the supporting cast is Donal Logue and Ray Liotta, two under utilized actors. I'm not really a fan of Amanda Crew as Charlie's love interest, Tess, but she does what she needs to.

Yes, the movie is a bit of a soap opera at times. And yes, it's predictable at times. And yes, Efron over acts at times. But somehow I was able to get past all of that and connect with the heart of the story and its characters and the message they deliver. The cinematography is stunning, the production design beautiful, and overall, this is a story and world I liked visiting. You might just like it too if you give it a chance.",1355616000,,1817,4.366863905325443

4122293,4,B003GAMOLY,"I love this movie, let me start my getting that out of the way.  This film adaptation is pretty different from the book that was written, but it's still a light hearted movie.  They kept the basic underlying of the story the same.  Charlie is mourning the loss of this younger brother by adapting how he sees fits, and if that means not breaking a promise, then he won't.  Of course there is a love story tie-in, but the twist is really fun.  I have to admit, I was surprised with that twist.  This is currently one of my favorite movies, and not because Zac Efron is in it. (Though he helps..)  I also think this movie helped to break him from the ""High School Musical"" mold.

The fun plus was when I purchased the DVD it came with a free instant video version as well.  I must admit I really enjoyed that little perk.",1354492800,,819,4.232258064516129

I like the emotion that resonates from the characters and how you can connect with them. To lose a loved one has a great impact on the heart, and Zac Efron shows this sadness realisticaly in the movie.

4122300,2,B003GAMOLY,"While this movie did entertain me, it did not entertain me in the way I expected.  Charlie St. Cloud is just plain bad, but at least I was able to get a good laugh out of it.  Though lazy writing largely characterizes this movie, the lack of flow was just as bothersome.  I don't blame the actors too much for the awkwardness, but it was in fact overacted, over-dramatized, and the lack of chemistry between the two leads distrated me from what might have been an OK plot.  On top of that, this movie was packed with cliques.  Far too many for me to stomach.  Had to laugh or roll my eyes.  Chose to laugh instead.",1353715200,,614,4.241379310344827

I related to the movie so I cried (yeah, I cried ! ) (a lot) The beginning is really sad and the end is really sad, but the end is that happy kind of sad. The end kind of reminded me of the end of lovely bones, different outlooks on crossing over. I feel that this movie would only be good for people that could relate to loosing a loved one, someone who knows that pain. My friend watched this movie and she said she didn't like it (because she doesn't know what its like to loose someone).

His emotional core is the center of the film, and Mr. Efron pulls it all off. His performance is outstanding. The relationship between him and his little brother was very true to life, and his romance with a woman who is about to do something he has longed to do, was quite realistic and touching. His connection with the spirit world is handled with great sensitivity and understanding. The supporting actors are all excellent. The actor who plays his buddy is very funny, and the two actors playing his brother and his love interest are quite good. The plot is very interesting and moves along very nicely.

4122439,5,B003GAMOLY,"Luckily caught this film on HBO the other night, otherwise I doubt I would have ever seen it. I think the reason it was received so poorly is because it was marketed as a kind of teenie bopper summer flic, when really its an emotional story about loss.  Critics tore into the film as overly sentimental, but if you have lost anyone in your life, then you'll understand, and likely find the bond between the brothers very touching and realistic.  I have never seen Zac Efron in anything before, and I think he does a fine job.  Also Augustus Pew [sic], I recognized from About a Boy, and he provides fun comedic relief.  The thing that makes this movie great is the beautiful cinematography and the subtle story telling.  It has its cheesy moments but it always keeps it fun ie the geese.

I'd heard pretty decent things about this and it was....just ok. Seemed like a cross between ORDINARY PEOPLE and ALWAYS, or maybe a GHOST WHISPERER episode.  What really got me though: the annoyingly 'cockney' friend of Zac's who's sole purpose seemed to be to give the film some London shabby-chic of the Russell Brand variety. There was never any explanation why some kid from London was digging graves and care taking at some remote Maine or Northern California seaside village!! Maybe the book explains it. I'm just so sick of these English actors being cast for no good reason and then they amp up their 'accent' (real or not) to 1000 db above normal (I'm talking to you, Rachel Weisz!).

Sully, actor brother of James, Lord have mercy...haha).  I found the movie addicting. I can't pass the channel if the movie is on now! no matter if the the movie is starting, in the middle or near the ending...gotta watch. AND YES, I have ordered the movie and it's on the way. I would recommend this movie before all others to all my fellow movie lovers. The story line is mesmerizing. I loss my sister several years ago and although we are much older than the characters in this movie, I still find myself wishing that the ending to her life and life as I knew it with her in it could have had an ending like Charlie and Sam's (meet at sunset cannons, come hell or high water,I promise!!)...if only for a while.

I guess that Universal Pictures marketing decided that they could sell DVD's if they didn't include this in the rental DVD. For me it had the opposite effect, an now when I go to buy a DVD I will make sure it is NOT Universal Pictures. I seriously doubt that people will flock to the store to buy a DVD just to get the Bonus portion.

4122495,5,B003GAMOLY,"Zac Efron has solidified himself as a leading man in Hollywood with his masterful portrayal of Charlie St. Cloud.  Without giving too much of the plot away, Efron absolutely shined throughout the film.  You felt every single bit of his angst, heartache, emptiness, and sadness.

I never read the book, but I'd imagine this movie more than did it justice.  What a beautiful, heart warming film.  I can't say enough good things about it.",1301702400,11,435,4.824324324324325

There were several important scenes in the book the movie left out. I feel as if the book gave more depth to the story. Zac Efron did a lot better job than what I gave him credit for, this guy will become a great actor. I believe he's on his way to becoming the next Brad Pitt or George Clooney.

The acting was good, but the story could have went much deeper and could have been much more emotional than it was.  It felt a bit lazy.  I thought it was good how the movie had adult themes. I'd say this one is a rental.",1298851200,,461,4.241379310344827

It starts off with Charlie and his younger brother Sam sailing (nice shots too) and hanging out before he is to go to Stanford on a sailing scholarship. It's obvious that they are very close and enjoy each other's company. But one night, their car gets hit while Charlie is driving and Sam dies. While clinically dead, Charlie makes a promise to Sam in the visions he has that he will meet Sam every day for baseball before sunset.

Then the movie skips five years ahead. Devasted and tormented by guilt, Charlie has taken a job as caretaker in the cemetery that Sam is buried in instead of going away to college and moving on with his life so he can keep his promise to Sam. Every day at sunset, Charlie meets Sam, who is caught in limbo between 'here' and the afterlife. It doesn't really explain what Sam does all day long and where he is, but it does make it clear that Sam doesn't want to 'move on' because he will miss Charlie and that he is afraid if Charlie doesn't meet him each day, he will disappear.

Then Charlie meets a girl, Tess, who also has a passion for sailing. Charlie struggles with moving on with his life versus keeping his promise to Sam. Then she disappears while boating and Charlie is forced to make a decision.

I really enjoyed the film and didn't realize Charlie was Zac Efron (who my son hates). His acting was excellent. The cinematography was great. This is a movie for all ages, nothing profane or sexual in nature in the movie, which is rare to find.

4122532,5,B003GAMOLY,"""Charlie St. Cloud"" starring Zac Effron as the title character, is a moving story about a young man discovering his purpose in life, even as he struggles to deal with death. After his younger brother dies in a car crash, Charlie puts his life on hold. His heart may still be beating but he has given up all his dreams and works instead as a cemetery caretaker. His sole joy in life? He meets his (deceased) younger brother every day for a game of catch. He promised he would and he does not want to break his promise for fear that he will truly lose his brother forever. When a beautiful woman comes into his life, he is forced to make a choice between living or holding on to the past.

This is an incredibly moving, surprising, life-affirming story. I was riveted by it. It has some very Catholic themes, including a belief in the power of St. Jude and the knowledge that when we die, it is far from the end. It is rated PG-13 and there is the suggestion of an inappropriate sexual act (although nothing is shown). Overall, however, it is incredibly well-done. It will both entertain you and make you think.",1297641600,4,1109,4.409756097560976
4122533,3,B003GAMOLY,"I heard great things about this movie, so I had high expectations going in.  I have to say, I was disappointed.  It was a beautiful piece in regards to cinematography and storyline, but the actual substance of the movie was lacking.  The characters were distant, so the emotion of the movie fell short and the relationships seemed superficial (although, the first fifteen minutes were promising).  The movie was rather predictable, as well.  I'm just glad I rented it instead of bought it, and I advise others to do the same.  While, it's not a terrible movie, I really wouldn't want to watch it more then once or twice.",1296691200,,620,4.694444444444445
4122534,5,B003GAMOLY,"Underated movie about a man and his sunken dreams when his younger brother dies in a car crash. Nuanced understated performance from the usually happy go lucky lead supported with a tight script and cast. Zac Efron is a real revelation as a serious and considered actor, and Augustus Prew is perfectly cast as a ""kinda"" alter ego to Charlie. Subtle moments of direction and photography from Burr Steers. Cool songs throughout underscore feeling in the viewer from the likes of Electric Owls, Ramones, Andrew Bird and Pink Mountaintops supported by a superb melodic score from Rolfe Kent. A magical, MAGICAL, allegory comparing the sailing setting against Charlie's home setting as a metaphor for life, dreams and the choices we must ultimately make. Bought the US release of the DVD weeks ago - gets even better with more viewings and Bluray on order for its imminent release in the UK next week - my best of 2010!

The kid who played his brother, Charlie Tahan, gave an equally effective and brilliant performance as Sam St. Cloud. Hope to see Tahan in more things soon.

4122582,2,B003GAMOLY,"I have to start by saying that I give Zac Efron props for trying to break out of his High School Musical/Teenage Heartthrob stereotype. He is certainly trying to differentiate himself from his past characters and for that I give him a great deal of credit. It is difficult for a teen sensation to break out from the mold he has made for himself, especially if that childhood mold was as lucrative as Efron's. Sadly, I don't think Charlie St. Cloud was the role to break Efron free from his teen bop status. The plot is weak, the writing is cliched, and the storyline is beyond convoluted. It seems that this movie was made to show Efron's acting chops but instead it comes off as a Hallmark version of The Sixth Sense.

Charlie is a sailing champ who is devoted to his younger brother, Sam, and their single mom. While the two brothers are close, Charlie has just graduated and wants to spend time with his friends. One night, while their mom is out, Charlie is put in charge of watching Sam. The two get into a bad car accident in which Sam is killed. Charlie is unable to forgive himself. He defers going to Standford and spends five years working as a landscaper/caretaker of the local cemetery. Every evening he meets Sam's ghost in the forest to plan catch. Charlie's pattern is disrupted when he meets a female sailor with whom he falls in love. Suddenly he must choose whether to live in the past with the ghost of his brother or try to forge a life for himself in the present.

Though this movie touches on deep issues of life after death, grief, and regret, it does little more than tap on these issues. As a Massachusetts resident, it was hard for me to believe that this movie actually took place in Quincy when in fact it looked a great deal like the California coast. Yet my greatest disappointment was how forgettable this film is. I only watched it a couple of days ago and my memory of it is already hazy. I always look for movies and books that leave a lasting impression and make me continue to think about the characters for days or even weeks. This is not so with Charlie St. Cloud. Though I wanted to like this movie and cheer for Efron's development as an actor, I found myself disappointed.",1294617600,2,2213,4.434889434889435

CSC is such a soul searching and inspirational story that tests the brotherly bond and open the ""in between"" world up to the viewer in a way that is just so emotionally charged, you may literally shed tears or laugh out loud at any second.

If you have any heart at all (and especially if you have children of your own), this movie will make you cry, so stock up on the tissues. However this is one of the few movies that crying is not a bad thing. In order for most people to cry during a movie, you have to fall in love with the characters and ""care"" if they are sad, which then makes you sad. That's the sign of a great movie and Charlie St. Cloud is a GREAT MOVIE that still resonates in my recent memory after seeing 3 days ago. The acting is absolutely incredible by both Efron and his little brother Sam. By this movie, rent this movie, do what you have to do to see this movie NOW.",1291939200,,1400,3.9645390070921986

As the story begins, Charlie and his brother, Sam are in the winners' circle. They are great both at sailing and at their academics. However, a fatal car crash soon changes all that.

Both the brothers die in the crash, however, only Charlie is eventually brought back to life. However, it would appear that his crossing over into the realm of death, even though it may have only have been for a few minutes, has changed him. He is now able to communicate with the dead, maybe his 'sixth sense' has been awakened by this experience.

Over the next few years, Charlie has abandoned going to university, and has taken up a lowly job maintaining a graveyard, where every early evening he meets with Sam. He also has an encounter with a former classmate, who had joined the U.S. Marines and was killed in action.

**** Potential Spoiler Ahead ****
---------------------------------

The film is just about to stall and go into a nose dive when enter Tess, a young pretty independent sailor of some renown. A romantic relationship starts to develop between Charlie and her. It is at this point the story blurs and a romantic game of ""find me"" in the dark turns into a life and death search and rescue event.

Charlie is able to discern a message from Tess, indicating that he needs to find her, in order to save her life, this is apparently the reason why he was given a second chance at life. The movie has its sad moments, but overall, it is quite uplifting. Never say die.",1290988800,,1605,4.539792387543253
4122623,4,B003GAMOLY,"Letting go is never easy.  For Charlie St Cloud, the death of his brother Sam triggered a change of life. Once a champion sailor, his brothers' passing left him lost, and with a unique ability to see dead people.  Spending every night playing ball with his dead brother, he denies his future for his past.  A second ghost begins to haunt him as his 'girl', Tess, another sailor, is lost at sea.

Charlie, missing his nightly appointment with Sam, says goodbye to his brother while he discovers that to move ahead, he must face the future head on. Relying on the faith in St Jude that the paramedic who saved his life gives him, he heads out to sea and finds Tess barely alive.

This is one great movie with a good message.  Zac Efron delivers a strong performance as Charlie and Amanda Crew is a good mesh for the psychologically/psychic challenged sailor.  Each cast member builds into this strong character driven film, and turns this into more of a thriller as opposed to a romance or rite of passage film.

Truly, the film shows the maturation of Efron as an actor.  His co-stars, Liota, and Basinger are just part of the package.",1290470400,,1134,4.54679802955665
4122624,4,B003GAMOLY,"I have to say I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I didn't what to expect considering the main star of the movie. The movie started a little slow, but once it took off I really enjoyed it. Charlie St Cloud is based on an acclaimed novel and follows a young man named Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron). Charlie survives an accident and now he is able to see his little brother (Sam) who did not survive the accident. Sam and Charlie make a promise to meet each other everyday at a certain time, but when Charlie meets a girl it forces him to decide to live in the world he has discovered with his brother or his new found love. I will not give away the ending, but I will say it was a pleasant unexpected one. The blu-ray of Charlie St Cloud looks picture perfect in 1080p and the DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound is perfect.

4122627,3,B003GAMOLY,"Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick adapted the book for the screen and director Burr Sherwood (known for his other films that are of this genre) stirs the whipped cream.  It is a pretty story with pretty people filmed in a pretty location (British Columbia) and the results are pretty predictable, yet when compared to the types of stories on film that flood the theaters at least this film has gentle heart and a lack of terror and horror and for that we should be pleased.

Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron, who holds in own in this rather implausible role) is a highly regarded young sailor who is wins a sailing scholarship to Stanford upon graduation from high school. He is devoted to his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) and his single mother nurse Claire (Kim Basinger - don't blink or you'll miss her very brief appearance in the film).  One night while Claire is on extra shift at the hospital Charlie and Sam are in an auto accident: Sam dies, but Charlie is resuscitated by paramedic  Florio Ferrente (Ray Liotta, in another very brief cameo).  Charlie is devastated over Sam's death and gives up his chances for a life by taking a custodian job in the town cemetery so he can be near a certain spot where he 'sees' and communicates with Sam every sunset - a life long promise to never leave his little brother.  Five years pass and Charlie's friend Alistair (Augustus Prew) - his only other friend Sully (Dave Franco, brother of actor James Franco) has gone into the military - tries to encourage Charlie to date, but Charlie's eyes fall on Tess (Amanda Crew), a fellow sailor from the past, and love begins.  Tess decides to take a long solo voyage in her boat and disappears.  Charlie meets the now cancer-ridden and dying Florio who gives him his St Jude medal and encourages Charlie to embrace life.  Charlie strikes out on a mission to find the missing Tess and the rest is pretty obvious.

Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility, the team of actors is very fine - especially Zac Efron, whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame - so the film ends up being endearing.  The cinematography by Enrique Chediak is gorgeous and the musical score by Rolfe Kent leans heavily on sad love songs. It is not a profound film though it does dip gently into the ideas of 'the beyond', but there is something about the honesty of it all that makes it s a satisfying evening of entertainment.

4122661,4,B003GAMOLY,"""Charlie St Cloud"" features Zac Efron in the title role.  Charlie is an up and coming young adult who has just graduated high school and has the whole world in front of him when tragedy strikes.  The rest of the movie basically involves seeing how Charlie's life is altered and how he deals with his personal misfortune.  Efron, although relying on his eyes to do a lot of the acting, ultimately succeeds in gaining empathy for Charlie's unfortunate loss.

This a family film with a special message viewers of nearly all ages will enjoy.  The acting in other key roles is right on, including newcomer Charlie Tahan's depiction of Sam St Cloud and Amanda Crew's portrayal of the girl who captures Charlie St Cloud's heart.  The supporting characters are vividly brought to the screen by two of Hollywood's best: Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger.  Although professional critics didn't provide much praise for this flick, I think audiences will feel differently.

The screenplay is well formulated.  Due to various emotional events including love, loss, despair and (foruntately) true happiness taking place, I felt the pace of the movie was actually faster than the 1 hour and 49 minute run-time.

Bottom line: If you missed it in theaters, check out ""Charlie St Cloud"" on DVD.  Your family or friends will most likely rejoice your choice.",1286496000,,1332,4.928251121076233
4122662,5,B003GAMOLY,"This was an amazing movie. But if you don't like movies that have heartbreaking sad parts that stick with you after you finish the movie don't buy this one. Otherwise you're in for a very well put together heart full, and touching movie. At times the plot line is hard to follow. But I think if you can tell what's going to happen and when, the movie maker hasn't done their job. In this case you are hooked on the story and the acting the entire time. The moments between Charlie and his brother Sam where very heart warming and also heart breaking. All these things are the mark of a wonderful movie. It has a very good message: you can love your family forever, even if they are no longer with you, but you must also live your life. Zac Efron has come a long way from High School Musical. I think he could go the distance as an actor. The same can be said for his young co-star, Charlie Tahan, who played Sam St. Cloud. He was very convincing every second he was on the screen. I cried every moment it was intended with him. I think he also has a bright future as an actor. I really latched onto them both. Which means they where good at their parts. I give this movie, which will stay with me for a long time, a 10/10.",1285891200,,1222,4.160337552742616
4122663,5,B003GAMOLY,"What a great movie, a little predictable, but not too much.  It had a happy ending, and in this case predictability was a good thing, I was hoping it would end the way it did. Charlie St cloud is a kid who seemed to have it all going for him. He loved sailing and practised it religiously. He got so good at it that he recieved a scholarship to Stanford University.  But when a car accident takes his little brothers life, Charlie's guilt and loss cripples him mentally. He now has the ability to communicate with dead, specifically is little brother who he meets everyday before sundown to play catch. This movie is a tear jerker, the love between the brothers was too much to bear. I guess it helps that Zac Efron is just so damn gorgeous you simple can't not love him. Great movie, Fabulous performance by Zac Efron as Charlie St Cloud, this is the beginning for Zac, I hope he stays away from silly movie roles and moves forward and up with dramatic parts, he is VERY good at it.",1285804800,51,983,4.336956521739131
4122664,4,B003GAMOLY,"These brief and admittedly superficial comments are just some impressions on having seen the still new movie, ""Charlie St-Cloud"", that stars Zac Efron.  The film is a bit silly and weepily sentimental, but it provides Zac with many chances to pose beautifully his increasingly hunky body, ""hunkily man"" now rather than ""hunkily teenage boy"".  I wish that Efron had shown more bare skin, which, of course, is what everybody really wants to see in this kind of commercial endeavour, but he was shirtless at times.  (At some other times, his t-shirt would be soaking wet and clinging sexily to his ""hard"" body, very suggestively.)  Actually, Efron's acting is quite good; any faults are of the script, not his, for his acting really is exceptionally fine, certainly better than that of most of the other principal and secondary characters.

Zac even has pre-marital sex in this film, quite a change for this Disney studio-famed star!  That is going to shock some of his fans -- or, more likely, their parents and other cackling adults.  The sex, though, is quite discrete.  If it is there in the novel (which I have not read), then it would have to be in the film, too, to render the book cinematically with some fidelity.  The impressive, tranquil beauty of the sylvan setting of the film, which rivals the romantic couple's humanly physical allure for attention, is almost reason enough to see this movie.

This is not my favourite Zac Efron film, so far.  That honour goes to ""17 Again"", in which the ""eye candy"" charms of Efron are on more display, especially in those clinging, sweat-soaked gym outfits, in an entertaining and amusing film (one that has more focus and skill in script and in some other important other ways) in which Zac Efron acts utterly to perfection, much better, in fact, than too many critics are willing to admit.  Often Zac Efron transcends ""his material"" (the films) in a most gratifying way, and he does that again in ""Charlie St-Cloud"".",1285459200,,1966,4.818452380952381
4122665,4,B003GAMOLY,"Overview: Charlie and his younger brother, Sam, are enjoying the last few weeks of summer before Charlie goes to college on a sailing scholarship.  Tragedy strikes and Sam's life is lost while a tormented Charlie's life is saved.  Instead of going on with life, he lives alone in the woods and starts working at the cemetery.  Why does he stay behind?  Because he can see his dead brother and promises to meet him every day to practice baseball.  Thus begins the story of Charlie St. Cloud, a young man who ""stops living"" because he can see dead people and does not want to let go of the memory of his brother.
Good Content: Charlie's dedication to Sam (alive and dead) is a good example of being a good brother.  Even when Sam has died, Charlie keeps his promise to Sam.  Later in the film Charlie turns out to be a rational young man as he makes a choice between ""himself"" and another person's life.
Spiritual Content: The fact that Charlie can see dead people is not necessarily creepy.  It's more of a psychological thriller than anything.  Charlie and Sam have a conversation about what would happen to Sam if Charlie broke his promise and stopped visiting him.  Sam is concerned he will ""cease to exist"".  Charlie's life was ""saved"" by a paramedic who is a strong Catholic.  Later in life the two meet and the paramedic asks Charlie why he was ""given a second chance to live"" and if he will use this second chance for a good purpose.  The paramedic believes saving Charlie was a heaven-sent act.  He wears a pendant of St. Jude around his neck.
Sexual Content: Charlie and his girlfriend Tess spend a night together in the cemetery.  Nothing is seen because the camera cuts out right before anything happens but cuts back in afterwards.  Same tells a few crude jokes (I only got one of them because another audience member was laughing as if it was a dirty joke).
Violent Content: We see some aspects of the car crash that Charlie and Sam are in.  We see them while they are in the ambulance-Charlie's face is somewhat bloody.  Charlie gets in a fist fight with another young man.
Profanity: a total of about seven or eight profane words ranging from h-- to s--
Conclusion: Unnecessary elements (such as the cemetery scene, some language) make this a PG-13 film.  While the idea of the plot seems ""iffy""-a young man spending time with his dead brother-it doesn't really touch on anything spiritual in terms of life and death.  Rather, it is more of a psychological, ""think about it"" film.  Borderline tragedy, chic-flick, drama, this film is recommended for mature audiences who are not opposed to somewhat ""unrealistic"" stories.",1283212800,56,2635,4.672451193058568
4122666,5,B003GAMOLY,"This was a movie that we fully expected to find heartbreaking but we weren't at all prepared for the amount of emotion that this movie would promote.  Zac Efron deserves an Emmy for his performance as the broken-hearted, older brother suffering through the loss of his little brother.  He finally finds love and your heart soars when it is returned to him.....when the twist in this movie comes at you, you'll be rocked off of your seat...have plenty of tissues handy and ready your heart to feel love for characters that will, without a doubt, steal your heart.

Charlie St. Cloud is the best movie I have seen in a decade, in that it makes you fall in love and you will take the roller coaster ride of your life...when the ride stops, you'll find yourself pulling for Charlie; that he will be able to live his life to the fullest.",1282262400,3,832,4.496688741721854
4122667,4,B003GAMOLY,"This thought provoking movie is certainly worth seeing. It's not without its flaws but the positives outweigh the negatives. The acting by Zac Efron is really superb and he carries the movie. The first time I saw it I was a little confused with some of the details in the storyline, especially when he keeps talking to dead people, but the second time I saw it a lot of things made more sense.  I think you have to be in the right mood to see it and also there are a lot of details that you notice more during the second viewing. I also felt at first that they were playing on Zac Efron's stunning good looks a little too much with their close up camera shots etc., not that I'm exactly complaining, ha ha, but at first I found that distracted from the touching storyline. The main themes of making the best of second chances, and that if God gave you a second chance to live what would you do with it, really do make you think. It's also about moving forward and leaving your past sorrows behind, as well as a subtle message of not taking your loved ones for granted.  The love story is secondary in some ways as the characters struggle to deal with these issues in their lives.

Charlie is a father figure to his younger brother Sam as their father abandoned the family. They do everything together and even won a sailing competition as a team. Charlie promises his brother that he will teach him to play baseball and they agree to practice every day at sundown.  Charlie is left with ""Sam Duty"" and has to babysit his eleven year old brother when their Mom has to work an extra shift. Charlie tries to sneak away when it's dark and when Sam catches him in the act, he winds up taking Sam with him. Sadly, they are then in a tragic car accident caused by a drunk driver and Charlie is devastated when Sam dies.  The plan is that Charlie will put Sam's baseball glove in the casket at the funeral, but when it comes to it he isn't able to bring himself to do it.  He runs away from the funeral and meets Sam's ghost in the woods.  They continue meet to play catch every night and here comes the crunch when Charlie starts to fall in love.  He is faced with the dilemma of choosing Sam's world or moving forward with his new girlfriend Tess also known as ""sailor girl"" who is planning a solo trip around the world.  Charlie works in the graveyard in order to be close to Sam and feels he can't break his promise to his brother.

I didn't find this movie predictable, but it contained some inconsistencies or things that may be offensive to some. After the accident Charlie abstains from alcohol and one wonders if this is because of the accident, but later he seems to drink freely.  I found the parts where he sees other ghosts to be a tad confusing at first viewing, but it all made sense later on.  People who have died in the film seem to be in a sort of half-way state when they stay on earth until they are ""ready"" to go on to heaven.  It seems in the story that they choose this time themselves, when they are ready to go. Some are ready to go quickly as Charlie's former classmate who went on to war and others are hesitant to go such as Sam because he wants to stay with Charlie. It's not clear where Sam is when  he isn't with Charlie. Sam does not seem to be aware of people who died, but Charlie's friend tells Charlie he will say hi to Sam for him when he decides to go.  Also, the location of the implied love-making scene will be viewed by some as inappropriate even though it is within ""PG guidelines"".

I like the strong Catholic Christian message in the film and although there is some minimal swearing and a few religious exclamations with God's name, the message that God has a purpose for people's lives comes through clearly.  I also like how the paramedic who saved Charlie's life attributed Charlie's second chance to God's intervention. He wore a St. Jude charm around his neck and later we find out that St. Jude is the Saint for desperate or hopeless causes. Charlie learns through his experiences why God gave him a second chance and he is able to apply this same truth that was passed on to him, allowing a miracle to happen.

I'd recommend this film for Zac fans, but also people who want a story to think through things on a deeper level.  The last time I went to see the film, on its last day showing here, I was the only person in the theatre which I hope isn't a bad sign as to the movie's popularity. If so, that would be too bad as it is a good movie even though it's not everyone's ""cup of tea"". It's pretty sad in parts, so do make sure you have kleenexes in your pocket so you don't have to use the theatre's serviettes! (Am I the only one who does that?...Winks) Also, Zac can cook for me anytime! :)",1282176000,2,4740,4.270089285714286
4122668,3,B003GAMOLY,"Film: Charlie St. Cloud
Director: Burr Steers
Writers: Craig Pearce, Lewis Colick
Cast: Zac Efron, Charlie Tahan, Amanda Crew, Kim Basinger, Donal Logue, Ray Liotta, Dave Franco
Year: 2010

Charlie St. Cloud is a film that wants to be everything. It wants to be a grief drama. It wants to be a romance. It wants to be film about the bond of brotherhood. It wants to be a film about sailing. It wants to be a supernatural drama. It wants to be a comedy. It wants to be a melodrama. Is Charlie St. Cloud anything of those things: the answer is maybe. Sure all of those elements are present in the picture, but none of them are fully developed to truly connect. Based on the novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood, Charlie St. Cloud misses the sweet, tender nature of the Sherwood's writing and the awe that lays in the center of his novel.

The story revolves around Charlie (Zac Efron, Me & Orson Welles), a promising young sailor whose life is put on perpetual hold when he causes the car accident that kills his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan, Nights in Rodanthe). With his mother (Kim Basinger, L.A. Confidential) devastated and leaving town, Charlie, runs off into the woods to encounter Sams ghost, promising him that he will continue playing baseball with him every night at dusk. Years pass and Charlie works at the cemetery where Sam is buried to fulfill his promise, when he meets the beautiful young sailor, Tess (Amanda Crew, Sex Drive). Through that relationship he starts to question that if living a secluded life in ""the in-between"" is really whats best for him or if finally letting go is what he needs to do.

As you can tell from the plot of the film, there is a lot going on. The supernatural aspects nearly sink the story into sappy melodrama and quite honestly don't make much sense. The scenes of grief and the effect that Sam's death has on his family, especially, Charlie, are well done but sadly there aren't enough of them to fully resonate. The one aspect of the film that really does connect is that of Charlie and Tess' romantic relationship. It's the strongest plot point until a third acts emotional reveal threatens to destroy the entire structure.

Regardless of the scripts schizophrenia, the film is, shockingly, held together by Zac Efron's strong performance. Coming a long way from his work in High School Musical and 17 Again (which was also directed by Burr Steers), Efron is showing real range as an actor. He has the good looks (which the camera relishes) and the charm and charisma to be a true leading man. He creates a very honest and true emotional arch for Charlie and does connect well on screen. The same can be said for Amanda Crew. She has a light and natural screen presence that helps add to the believability of the romance.

Since the film never actually picks one genre, the emotional weight of the story is pat. The cinematography is beautiful and Efron's performance is worth a look for sure, but there really is not much else to take away from this, inoffensive, but ultimately uninteresting picture. Younger, undemanding, easily manipulated audience members will certainly take to the film, but anyone looking for an emotionally complex study on grief and family will need to see Ordinary People instead.
