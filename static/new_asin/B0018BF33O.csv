8269221,4,B0018BF33O,"This video's leading point of interest is the entire Isle of Wight concert, ""Call It Anythin',"" an intense medley from the summer of '70. There we see the intense pairing of Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett both on keyboards. That is the five stars section.
The closing 1971 set is more subdued and less inspired, perhaps owing to Corea's departure from the band.
The opening set is from Jarrett's Charles Lloyd years, which would be an OK set by itself, but it pales in comparison to the Isle of Wight concert. The middle section alone is reason for buying this. I",1385683200,6,562,4.574257425742574
