5658042,5,B00BNB9AVA,"The movie is an amazing treat for anyone who is married, who plans to marry, any wife, any husband any mistress or mistress to be and any husbands who are thinking about having an affair..
This amazing picture shows in a hilarious way the toll that extra martial affairs take on people. All people. Super witty movie.
Both main characters are casted and played to perfection. You got your aging wife who is just so lovable and great and you got this mistress that you want to hate but you want to like at the same time because outside of the stereotyping you see real people in the act. It was superb job to cast the actresses in the roles. Actress who played the mistress did wonderful job because playing a less-then-smart person takes more-then a genius :)
Great job everybody!",1381795200,6,780,4.539007092198582

5658044,5,B00BNB9AVA,"Witty, smart, funny, and touching... I love this film! It's well cast and beautifully actedan intelligent comedy. ""If I Were You"" is one of the best films I've seen in years.",1375660800,5,174,4.645161290322581
5658045,5,B00BNB9AVA,"My husband was out for the evening so thought I'd check out the new indie films for a high rated chick flick. This one fit the bill perfectly. It is a fun rather far-fetched story of a friendship that forms between the young lover of a married middle aged man and (unbeknownst to her) his wife. They both realize that they are making bad life choices for themselves so decide to try out letting the other make relationship and career choices from them (""If I were you...""). Despite the wife's initial motive of breaking up the relationship with ""the other woman,"" she starts developing a genuine friendship with the younger woman, although of course is it based on lies and deceit. Both women get yanked out of their rut and comfort zone and begin recognizing and learning how to break out of self-destructive and self-limiting patterns. The focus is more on the development of the relationships rather than realism of storyline. All-and-all a perfect evening-alone (or with a best girlfriend) chick flick.",1370736000,4,1006,4.854651162790698
5658046,5,B00BNB9AVA,"IF I WERE YOU is one of the most charming comedies that I have seen in some time, and unlike the trends today, the humor is not gross, but character driven.

Marcia Gay Harden is a delight as a successful businesswoman who accidentally discovers that her husband (Joseph Kell) is having an affair with a young ""actress,"" played by Leonor Watling.  Almost immediately thereafter, fate puts Marcia and Leonor together, but the younger woman is unaware that her new friend is the wife of her lover.

The ladies form a unorthodox pact whereby each will advise the other how they should handle their love lives.  Marcia, of course, has the advantage here, though she is not quite sure as to how she feels now about her husband, and her situation becomes even more complicated when she meets a handsome stranger (Aidan Quinn).

The Harden/Watling ""friendship"" becomes even stranger when both ladies are cast in a stage production of King Lear, and Marcia gets the title role.

Written and directed by Joan Carr-Wiggin, If I Were You is filled with witty dialogue and features a talented cast.  Ms. Harden, who usually plays more serious roles, proves herself to be quite adept at comedy.  Indeed, she is a joy to watch.

The DVD from Kino Lorber includes cast interviews.

5658047,5,B00BNB9AVA,"These two women are amazing together!  The best movie I've seen in a long time.  Madeleine (Marcia Gay Harden) and Lucy (Leonor Watling) are such an odd, but endearing pair, it just makes you want to call your best friend and tell her you love her!

5658070,4,B00BNB9AVA,"One of the best dark comedies I've seen in a long time. Heck, one of the best MOVIES I've seen in quite a while. Marcia Gay Harden is absolutely marvelous. And I think the ending is perfect. We don't always know what happens to people in real life. I like that her options were wide open. But I think it's pretty easy to determine what she will do if you just think about it a bit.",1522022400,,381,4.026315789473684
5658071,3,B00BNB9AVA,Sme of it was pretty good but I felt like the ending was gave no resolution.  Could have been much better if she ended up having a relationship with the guy from the nursing home for example.,1521936000,,191,4.162162162162162
5658072,4,B00BNB9AVA,"Harden is unsurprisingly awesome and the plot is a clever take on an age old problem and all characters are treated with dignity even if the mistress is very underdeveloped. Quinn does a lot in his supporting role- believable real people all around. For what it is, this film is wonderful and good-natured. Recommended",1521936000,,318,4.907407407407407

5658075,5,B00BNB9AVA,"Marcia Gay Harden gave an outstanding performance in this movie! This was an off the cuff view into the heartbreak of seeing your spouse with someone else. The story was excellent in both the structure and approach with all the turns bringing an unexpected but brilliant twist to the story. If you want a raw look at how things are, and then how they could be, then this is one move not to miss! All actors were excellent in their parts as well and made the movie that much more enjoyable.

5658095,4,B00BNB9AVA,"Although the movie dragged, there are just precious moments by Marci Gay Harden alone,  with Leonor Watling and with Aidan Quinn in the nursing home after her mother and his father died. Enough special moments to make it worth it.",1518998400,,230,4.75

I did enjoy this movie.",1517184000,,199,5.0606060606060606
5658131,5,B00BNB9AVA,"This movie is awesome. Brilliant in its treatment of an emotionally-charged, delicate topic, tons of humor and humanity. Turns the conventional judgements about the subject matter around and compels the viewer to examine it from a completely different angle- that of the complexity of human relationships, and what would happen if we stepped outside our own paradigms and extended compassion instead. Life is complex- and it's our ability to adapt to that complexity that determines how happy we can be among all the circumstances we will never be able to control. Well played!

One caveat is that it is definitely a dialogue movie, so if you're attention span runs out if you don't have constant action then this would not be the film for you. Same goes if you are looking for a simplistic morality lesson in which wrongdoers are punished and victims are vindicated.",1517184000,7,867,4.979310344827586

Some reviewers described the movie with words like tender, filled will joy and humor, poignant and  heart warming.  Those descriptions area really, really a stretch.  I didn't like the ending as there was no closure.  I also didn't like the fact that the two main female characters demonstrated such destructive, demoralizing behavior. And, this was the overall theme throughout the movie.  One was going to hang herself and the other one started drinking alcohol.  In the end she was also going to kill herself.  Do you call that heart warming, filled with joy and tender?  I should hope not.  The two timing, rotten husband is the only one who kept it together.  As a women I just felt embarrassed for them. Just to be clear, I am not a feminist. I just didn't like the message the movie was sending.",1517011200,,876,4.62987012987013

5658156,5,B00BNB9AVA,"I adored Marcia's character; her age, her sense of humor, her style. This is both a serious everyday story of the unfairness of life. At the same time, how she handles everything; drinking hardcore scotch, befriending the woman seeing her husband, liking her, joining the lame community theatre group and landing her role in it, having affairs. I adored this movie. I do not think suicide was handles lightly. She stopped it and later contemplated it and the same woman stopped her. It was real , meaningful and charming. I loved her character as a slightly older woman and how women survived and thrived past men's whims. I also loved Aiden's character; although small. I just love him as a person. It almost reminded me of Almodavar's Women on the Verge of  Nervous Breakdown ( the real Spanish one with english subtitles)...",1516233600,,827,4.823943661971831

That ending made me want to see an entire King Lear with them. I'd love to see Harden as Lear. She puts such punch and believability into it. Watling's turn as Fool is short, but it made me hunger for more. Very moving. Her bit strangely reminded me of Gunnar Bjrnstrand playing Fool in a small slice of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander.

5658162,5,B00BNB9AVA,"All I can say is that this is why we need more women to keep directing, writing and developing excellent scripts, and showcasing talented actresses of all ages. In case male-dominated Hollywood still has a doubt, there is an undeniable audience for films about middle-aged women who lead full, interesting lives, and this film and its great reception prove it. As expected, Marcia Gay Harden is a dynamo in this complex role; she is a first-class actress at the top of her game.

Harden is incredible; she brings all the pain, shock and revulsion to the forefront and then peels away all the layers to let us see and learn why. Danielle is so vacuous, such a clueless youngster playing with people's lives, that her naivete clearly seems bewildering and so innocent. When she shows her claws and fangs, it is as if she has no other response left because she realizes it is her only chance to win the prize, even when she clearly realizes it isn't really a prize. There are laughs and sighs and sadness and sarcasm nuanced in this fast-paced drama that spills the guts of each character center stage. I loved it. Great dialog, good surprises, nice twists and turns, loving touches throughout. Sad and funny from a distance. True life? Not really. Good thing. Too painfu, if it were though ...

 Ultimately the pretty mistress wins the ""husband"" but she and the wife have a Shakespeare play to do together which turns out successful for both of them.  The film had little to do with the felonious enslavement demands of the felony tax evading ""religion"" establishment but was a well written exploration of the foibles of the sexually inexperienced, none of whom were over ten persons of age let alone fully developed.",1512172800,,569,4.855670103092783

MGH plays the wronged wife with great humor and credibility. A few predictable plot points don't really spoil what then evolves into an homage to small theater groups, Shakespearean farce, and an unexpectedly moving ending.

To watch the very well acted, emotional processes of each of these women as they clearly grew, changed, and deepened translated from their strangely believable yet somewhat inconceivable, situation into the words of King Lear, onto the stage, and into the feminine was truly stunning. What a great way to explore this horribly painful subject. So many levels to this movie, so much to think about.",1511308800,,559,5.065217391304348

If you have ever been in the position to accidentally fall upon the reality that your husband is staying, you can completely relate to what Madeline is challenged with, given the opportunity to dive into the details in the most unexpected way.  As unlikely as the premise is for this movie, it works all the way, coupled with fantastic acting and great casting.

I found it to be a fabulous diversion and an absolute treat of a movie.  I watched it on Prime on my computer and laughed out loud so many times, my husband came over to see what was so funny.

Well done, all the way around.  Marcia Gay Harden was BRILLIANT in this role.  Emmy stuff!",1508630400,,698,4.536
5658329,5,B00BNB9AVA,"CRAZY plot!  A dark comedy, engaging from the first moment, with a knock out performance from Harden -- especially in the final moments, when the play is finally mounted.  She doesn't hit a false note in the entire outrageous film.  I could happily see it a second time for her performance alone, which I rarely ever consider.

If you are expecting a formulaic romantic comedy or ""Hollywood-bitchy""  husband-dumps-wife-for-younger-woman situation this probably won't be your cup of tea -- much stronger brew here, yet never overwrought. Although their actions are unlikable, nobody in the film is demonized (although a few are caricatures).  It is a real credit to Harden to watch a totally unbelievable story line develop so believably.  SO refreshing to see a film where the women are more finely drawn than the men. More please.

5658346,2,B00BNB9AVA,"The acting by Marcia was phenomenal, and the unlikely turns of the plot were solid, as was some of the unexpected language choices in the lines, but this film was so chock full of misogyny it was difficult to watch at moments. Marcia's character was well developed, but the other woman's character was so underdeveloped it was not authentic. Her acting was pretty good, but there was zero back story for her and they played on her physical attributes to such a severity that it came at the expense of authenticity - few people are as dumb as that character was written.  Because the acting was really good by most characters in giving this 2 stars instead of 1.

I didn't give this a 5 because I'm not ""in crazy love"" with it.  I probably won't see it again any time soon. But, and maybe this is just me, I found the premise quite believable.  I enjoyed seeing the affair from both sides at the same time.  I liked the character played by Marcia Harden.  I believed in her and could see how someone, a nice person, could fall into such a trap.  I even came to like the mistress.  The characters learned and grew and helped each other and found happiness.  What more could you ask for.  The naysayers seem particularly upset that she had sex with a total stranger.  Now I was in my sexual prime during the sexual revolution between the introduction of birth control and the spread of HIV so maybe I have a slightly different take on this but I didn't find it disturbing or unbelievable at all.  And I really loved the play at the end.  Marcia's acting was terrific in both the movie and the play.",1507852800,7,1064,4.182266009852217

Overall I liked the movie, the storyline was good, the characters were great, showing what is is like for the women on both sides of the affair. The only downside is the ending, I really wanted to know what Maddelyn decided to do next! Did she forgive and get back with her husband? Does Lucy keep him? Do they both dump him? Does she give it a go with the other guy? Throughout the movie you see Lucy transition and out grow her obsession with the married man, but as far Maddelyn, you never really know which way she's going to go. It would have been nice to at least had a hint at the end as to what her decision was going to be going forward.",1507680000,,775,4.105263157894737

One reviewer calls the ending ""dull."" I disagree. We're left not knowing whether Lucy told Paul the truth as promised, or, if so, whether Paul tried to make up with Madelyn. In any case, will Madelyn continue with the man met in the funeral home? With such issues open, the *story* cannot be said to end.

5658393,1,B00BNB9AVA,"Stupid scenario, insipid plot. As a child I never accepted, laughed about, or liked ""I love Lucy"".  I found her to be a liar, cheat, deceitful, conniving,
a user to both her husband and friends.  She was self centered and blind to the feelings of others as she broke trust time and again. She practiced evil and got awards for it.  Marcia Harding goes through most of the movie swigging out of a bottle and acting drunk; a female Dudley Moore.  The mistress has no shame or guilt from her actions nor in telling a stranger about her stealing another man from his wife.  Sleeping with a strange person because someone else 'told you' to, not knowing his name, these people hold no morals or integrity because they practice evil.  I have never found these low character traits to be funny nor entertaining.  I wouldn't have these kind of low-life's as friends, allow them in my home or life, and I sure don't want to spend time watching and listening to what is nothing more than evil.  These movies are produced by like-minded people that know they will make money off of the like-minded public.  They are godless movies depicting godless people, watched by the accepting, godless public.  Follywood KNOWS this, that's why Amazon buys it, they know it too.  Humans accept evil as normal...or funny",1507334400,6,1296,4.6902654867256635
5658394,5,B00BNB9AVA,"If you like the comedy movies of the 1940's with strong leading ladies like Jean Arthur, Rosalind Russell, Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, then you'll like this modern take with Marcia Gay Harden. It is a good, funny, movie with a strong leading actress role for an actress who isn't in her 20's and can still be the desire of not 1 but 3 men! Sure, one of the men is her cheating husband who now desires her when he thinks she's cheating on him.

By unusual circumstances she befriends her husband's mistress and ends up helping the younger woman grow up and mature. She learns things -- vulnerabilities and emotional lacking -- in both herself and her husband through this unexpected friendship.

The story is well written with enough depth to get you, too, involved into what each woman should do. Marcia's accidental role in a theatrical production of King Lear (in the movie) is excellent acting.

I can so very much see Rosalind Russell in a version of this movie from back in the 1940's but this is 2017 and, yes, the F word is used freely -- just like you now hear on the streets anywhere you go. And, yes, it is about infidelity -- you know that from the brief desciption of the movie so I don't understand why some people were offended. This is a really good movie for a female lead, well acted, and a modern day screwball comedy.",1507248000,2,1336,4.467213114754099

We reflect on our decisions that included careers, children or no children and what we want when we retire.  We think about our parents and dealing with them as they age.  This movie was well written with clever moments and scenes that made me laugh out loud.  Marcia Gay Harden did a splendid job showing the wide wide of emotions and played well a scorned woman who finds tenderness even in the worst circumstances.  The side characters - especially her manager and his wife were quite humorous.  This is not a light comedy but rather a movie with comedic moments.

It is so rare to find modern movies that are able to compete with the numerous mid-twentieth century movies that mastered this style of comedy. Only a small number of movies have succeeded in this category of comedy in the last forty years. A lot of great comedies are made every decade, but this style is a dying art. Great dramatic parts too and full range of emotion in this movie. I hope you enjoy it.",1506729600,2,559,4.436893203883495

It is understood that the movie is based on an immoral premise of a husband being unfaithful to his wife.  It used to be that there was a redeeming character that opted to do the ""right' thing and somehow the circumstances all worked out either for the best or because the person did the right thing there was some redeeming quality to the movie.  Instead the victim turns around and has a sexual encounter with a complete stranger in a funeral home while waiting to make arrangements for her mother who had just died.  How utterly ridiculous!  Surely, we can produce better 'trash' than this.  And, all the five stars.  I can't believe it.  There was no redeeming quality to this movie whatsoever.  The cast and acting was okay, but so what.

5658450,5,B00BNB9AVA,"Fantastic movie with twists that force you to look at life a little differently. Madeline's empathy overcomes shallow anger and as she clearly struggles through some of the most devastating things in a person's life, infidelity, seeing the mistress as a human being and not 100% evil,  the loss of a parent, loss of boundaries in the workplace, she doesn't ignore them, (well, kind of with 2 bottles of scotch) but she grasps them and handles them without losing her mind. Her strength and her sense of self shines through.
All done with a gentle touch of comedy, with doing what the mistress tells her to do, the play and the cast, the recurring ice cream, and the madly infatuated boss. Valerie Mahaffey threatened to steal the thunder with her restrained presence, she is simple perfect as the suspicious wife of the boss, and Aiden Quinn was a wonderful addition, but honestly, the story would have survived perfectly without his storyline.

Instead, we are given a peak at the possible consequences of an improbable relationship where drama, humor, outrage and sympathy can all occur in close proximity. On the whole, the acting was very solid. The five-star rating may seem a bit of a push for a movie that has one or two drab moments that some judicious editing might have fixed. Four stars might be more appropriate except that I think it deserves the extra nudge for just being flat out entertaining.",1506297600,,661,5.12037037037037

Spoiler alert....though the ending is not that important, it is ""along the way"" that is the joy of this movie.

This movie is about a woman that finds out that her husband is cheating on her...and she had no idea...she thought they were happy. Now that is not so unusual; it is most everything else that comes after it that is. So if you are thinking ""Oh not another movie like that"", you are off. It isn't.

This movie would be good for the cheater, or the cheated on, as well as the homewrecker. The subject is heavy, but it is one scene after another, that make you smile, laugh sometimes, nod, cheer. The actors are excellent. The situation seems absurd, but the actors make it seem real, plausible even.

Stupid Prime kept shutting down ever few minutes, so after turning the TV on and off, close to 20 times; I went to my computer to see the end. That's how much I wanted to see the whole move.

Aiden Quinn is a favorite as well to say nothing of the rest of the cast, all unfamiliar to me but each great in their own role.  Leonor Watling was excellent as the mistress and definitely held her own with Ms. Harden.

IF I WERE YOU is the unlikely story of a middle-aged woman's friendship with her husband's hot mess of a mistress. Yes, it's unlikely, but it totally works. The wife begins to see all the same sad lack of confidence in the mistress, the same insecurities that are in herself. Together they develop an almost mother-daughter dynamic and wind up unexpectedly empowering one another. They wind up in what sounds like a terrible idea: a gender-reversed production of ""King Lear."" But with Marcia Gay Harden as Lear, it actually works. I would pay to see her do the entire Lear on stage someday.

Marcia Gay Harden is super as a wife whose world is shaken when she discovers her husband has a young mistress. This story has been told countless times without the laughs, but here Harden milks screwball gems from Joan Carr-Wiggin's great script.

It's not all laughs, of course, because comedy is best when it reveals real insight, which If I Were You does.

Try it. It's a surprise treat that seems like it should be set in Paris rather than somewhere in Canada.

This movie is almost completely between two women: a young girl having an affair with a married man, and the man's wife, who finds out about the affair, but then inexplicably becomes friends with the young woman. It is one of the few movies I can think of that handles emotionally complex situations in a realistic manner. Marcia Gay Harden is of course, fantastic. She plays dual emotions flawlessly, such as befriending the mistress while trying to get rid of her. There are men in the movie, but the real powerhouses are the women. LOVED this movie.

Mainstream critics hate this movie because there is no graphic sex, no nudity, no violence and most blasphemously of all, it doesn't follow one of the several tedious formulas every movie must adhere to these days---lest we have a new idea in our heads. Marcia Gay Harden is overwhelming as the main character, and I think she carries the movie but the rest of the cast are all affecting in their own way, especially Lenoir Watling. I didn't find the plot overly implausible, every story is implausible to some extent or another...real life itself, unfolding in real time, does not follow Vulcan logic. I have to laugh at the many ""professional"" critics (wow, talk about an easy job!!) who whine about the plot in this movie, while accepting with the innocence of a child the endless stream of moribund consequences and devices that the average Hollywood excretion regurgitates from the little book of how to write a Movie screenplay. Being original is quite an accomplishment in today's film culture, an example of this originality (I believe) is found in MGH's musings about death.

In fact, the two women both make a pact -  Madelyn with full knowledge of what shes doing and Lucy wholly in the dark - that they will leave all their major life decisions up to the other person - an ostensibly more dispassionate and objective person - so as to avoid incurring any more self-inflicted mistakes in their lives.

Written and directed by Joan Carr-Wiggin, If I Were You plays much like a modern-day Feydeau farce, its humor based on a complex web of interconnected coincidences, misunderstandings and strategically withheld information.  Its a clever, insightful little comedy that, by carrying its ironies and implausibilities to an almost absurd level, manages to make us face - and, even more amazingly, laugh at - just how real and cutting the pain caused by infidelity, romantic relationships and even platonic friendships can be.  But the movie also deals with such heady themes as deceit, betrayal, hypocrisy, self-worth and a womans place in the world, all without breaking a sweat. In fact, this becomes a growth experience for Madelyn who soon learns that she has a purpose and identity of her own apart from wife to a cheating husband.

Its true that the movie sometimes feels like its a beat or two off in its more broadly comic moments (especially early on the film) and the ending rates as a bit of a cheat and copout, but those weaknesses are easily overlooked amidst fine performances by Marcia Gay Harden, Leonor Watling, Joseph Kell and Aidan Quinn and an overall wisdom about how life works.",1385337600,,1840,4.791798107255521
5658498,5,B00BNB9AVA,"Marcia Gay Harden shines in the whacky but charming film. Its a cross between a romantic comedy and a dramedy. Hardens character, Madelyn, talks her husbands mistress out of committing suicide shortly after discovering that he is having an affair. She then plots to outwit the mistress, played Lenore Watling. Madelyn ends up having sex with a man she meets in the nursing home where her mother has just died and playing Leer in a production of Shakespeares play. Somehow this all works. The film is entertaining and quite enjoyable.

8571573,5,B00BNB9AVA,"What a lovely surprise of a movie.  Was not expecting much, but the trailer intrigued me so I took a look.  I laughed and enjoyed the movie more than I thought.  Marcia Gay Harden was perfect in this role.  Believable at every turn.  The relationship that develops between Madeline and Lucy is expected, seeing the kind of movie, but is done with such warmth and humor that it did not feel clich.  I would watch it again.",1530230400,,421,4.402597402597403

8571577,5,B00BNB9AVA,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this comedy/drama on Amazon. Reading the conventional critics' rather savage reviews astonished me. Not because they don't see as delightful--they're entitled to their opinions--but because it made me wonder if these presumed experts know anything about classic farce. Did they ever read Sardou and Scribe and study the well-made play? Have they seen, say, Noises Off? If I Were You keeps surprising us while touching the heart. My husband loved it, and so did I.",1529798400,,491,5.227848101265823
