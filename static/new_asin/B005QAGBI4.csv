8483014,4,B005QAGBI4,"Once thought lost, and maybe all the better for that, this is certainly a very poorly made film. But being a shoestring B-Western this clunker really holds one's interest, or at least it did mine. Somehow you just can't believe they're actually filming this and therefore it's inherent weirdness becomes fascinating, compelling you to become mesmerized by it's sheer incompetence as the film draws you slowly into it's web of bewilderment.

Whew, that's saying a lot for so little. But I actually enjoyed watching this film and applaud those involved for making a movie with obviously so many budgetary constraints. It only lasts around 50 minutes and any attempt at plot and/or characterization is absolutely mind-numbing...But here goes the good, the bad and the ugly of it.

The good:
Nice location shooting at what appears to be The Grand Canyon.
A Cisco Kid type bandit/hero who is appealing despite the bad accent.
A rough, realistic look to the whole thing. No fancy set designs here.
Charles Stevens, known to all B-Western fans for wearing the same clothes and playing a half-breed scoundrel in many Universal serials of the 1930's, going by names like Snake-Eyes, Breed and Puma, actually appearing here as a good guy, trusted friend to the hero. This is a refreshing change (of clothes) for Stevens and especially for his fans.
Really great dvd cover artwork from ALPHA. They're especially good at this.

The bad:
No budget at all. This is really a shoddy movie, but that somehow seems to work in it's favor, adding to the overall charm of the whole thing.
Some scripting confusion. Is a reel of this once lost B-Western still lost? If so, that may clear up some issues and push the running time closer to 60 minutes.
Lots of viewers brought up on today's digital and technological standards will most likely hate this cheapie 1934 home movie, but that's where most of the film's unique charm derives from.

The ugly:
Poor print, jumpy and splicy, but certainly watchable. I don't think that you'll ever see a much better version than this around any time soon, as though you would ever care to.
Missing chunks? Or just badly filmed? Who knows?
The dvd bills Ken Thompson as the star. As far as I know, there is no Ken Thompson in this film . The lead, Don Adios, is played by Pat Carlyle who also directed. Merrill McCormick played the lead badguy Chuck Reynolds, and aside from the aforementioned Charles Stevens, there are no other major male roles in this film. Carlyle went on to play a similar Cisco Kid hero in 1935's equally inept THE IRISH GRINGO, but that's another story.
One can laugh aloud at the goings on in this film, and would probably have every right to do so, but I found this film to be enjoyable in an odd sort of way, as though I were witness to someone's 1934 home movie of what they thought a B-Western should be.

Bottom line:
Highly recommended, you bet.",1330041600,,2892,4.707509881422925
