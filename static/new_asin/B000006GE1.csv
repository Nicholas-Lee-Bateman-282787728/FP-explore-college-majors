1194569,5,B000006GE1,"... Movies like this, and true stories like the finding of Elizabeth Smart, help people find hope when it is hard to find.
What others have written about the tear-jerking content of the last bit of this movie is especially true for me, because I have friends in law enforcement and I  know that the escort scene at the end could really happen. I can imagine how all the LEOs involved would feel, having seen big, tough, cops turn into big, sentimental, softies when kids are involved.
I'm buying it, and will buy it again if and when it comes out on DVD.",1054425600,11,554,4.378640776699029

Kate Nelligan gives one of the most credible and most emotional portrayals I have ever seen, and Judd Hirsch gives a performance which matches, if not exceeds, than he gave in ""Ordinary People"".  This was written to completely capture your attention by pulling at your emotions, and the stars of the movie do exactly that.

I wish more of these type stories in real life ended this well. When I watch this movie, I am alone. I refuse to put it on if there is anyone else around. The reason? I blubber like an idiot at the end. I have watched it at least ten times and it's always the same. The tissue box gets a workout. The only downside is that when I was looking to buy the DVD of this film, the price was $179 + $3.99 for S&H. You would think that Kate and Judd would deliver it in person for that amount. Get real.

The film is based on the book Still Missing,  and which is far better than the film as, not surprisingly, it gives greater space to develop the various themes and plot lines. This is not a criticism of the film, which in the time available does very well.

Still Missing is still in print in the UK, and is published by Persephone, who publish some fantastic books, and are well worth having a look at their website.",1420761600,3,618,4.310344827586207

You can get a DVD of any first rate movie used for a couple of dollars.  Naturally I will not be purchasing the DVD anytime soon until someone comes to their senses, but some marketing expert needs to grab this movie and re-release on DVD for Gods sake.  Look at all the excellent reviews here and on IMDB.  This movie has lasting appeal, many of us believe Kate Nelligan was robbed of the academy award we know she deserved.  Meryl Streep has never moved me the way Kate Nelligan does in this film.  Its simply a crime that it is not available for any reasonable price in a decent format, but I'll content myself with my good self-recorded VHS which still holds up beautifully from when I first recorded it in the 1980s.",1395964800,4,842,4.374193548387097

I found it unbelievable entertaining and highly recommend... now I must comment on the asking price on Amazon even for a used copy, this is past ridiculous especially when it can be seen on NETFLIX.

1194651,3,B000006GE1,"It's a good story line, but the cinematography is dated looking.  I saw it on Netflix tonight.  It comes across very realistic.",1392681600,,127,4.7272727272727275
1194652,5,B000006GE1,"Saw it on Netflix, and certainly would have bought it had it been available at a reasonable price: but NOT at the cost of $175 to $500 for a new copy of the dvd, and $66 to $150 for a used one.

  However, speaking of the film itself, it is an outstandingly acted and presented tale-- in fact, an outstanding ""cautionary"" tale regarding the assumption that all child kidnappings have to do with sexual perverts and their sick needs (with hated groups like gays falsely thrown under the suspicion bus for good measure).  We must learn to seek truth in the face of tragedy, and not just use tragedy as an outlet for the verification of our easiest-to-come-by prejudices and dreaded fears-- and this movie teaches that very effectively.

  What the movie never goes into (because of the point at which it ends) is how the supposedly highly experienced NYC lieutenant detective (played by Judd Hirsh), who claims to have learned so much from his many experiences with kidnappings, is ever going to explain to his superiors and the press  how his repeatedly rushing to judgment had kept him off the mark so many times for so long.  Experience, in other word, can blind a person as well as open one's eyes.

  Still, in the end, the detective (largely because of his identification with the grieving mother, as a fellow parent of a little boy) was able to forego all the face-saving impulses in order to go look for and find the child someplace where he had over and over again dismissed repeated indications, which says a lot about that character which could not as readily be said for many other real-life, pressured-for-results law enforcement officers, forensic specialists, and district attorneys caught in similar investigative mistakes made as a result of having given in to their biases and other self-serving concerns.

  The problem that sort of thing raises is not only that the innocent get blamed, but that the guilty go free to repeat their crimes upon other victims.  As a clinician-administrator in a state psychiatric hospital, I can tell you that we investigate fully all allegations made by patients regardless of how ""crazy"" the patient might be believed to be, using the notion that one never knows until he has looked into it if this could be the one time the patient expressed truth in his ravings.

  This movie makes that point with just enough creative subtlety to make the end come across as genuinely plausible-- hence the lesson for us all who have been honored with the task of bearing the public trust, but who might be inclined to jump to conclusions before looking more deeply (because or our own obsessive-compulsive need for certainty, or to appear to others very good at what we do).  I urge making this film available in a good quality dvd at a more reasonable price, for it is a true gem which the public (as inclined as it is so often to credit sensationalistic journalism as necessarily correct because they see it in print) should see and learn from.  Thank you.",1392249600,,2997,4.736030828516378
1194653,5,B000006GE1,"I watched this movie on HBO many years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was excellently done, and it was not publicized well.  Should have been a first run movie.  I think it is a very encouraging movie.",1389052800,,216,4.375
1194674,5,B000006GE1,"What's the best word to describe this movie from the early 1980s? Compelling? Gripping? A tear-jerker? All these and more positive adjectives would be appropriate, for this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I've seen it enough times (including in a theater when it first came out) that I've lost track of how often. And each time I see it I'm on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what is going to happen next.

Judd Hirsh gives a great portrayal of a congenial yet dogged detective who has been hired to search for a missing boy. Seemingly every lead (and there aren't very many of them) winds up in a dead end. Thankfully, he doesn't give up.

Kate Nelligan, in what is perhaps her best performance, plays the part of the distraught but determined mother who says goodbye to her son Alex one morning as he leaves for school and seemingly vanishes in thin air. Although without any good reason to hope, she refuses to give up and clings to her belief that Alex is alive and that some day she will be reunited with him.

If you have never watched this movie, do so. You won't be disappointed. If it's been a long time since you watched it, watch it again. It's worth it.",1388620800,3,1188,4.342342342342342

1194677,1,B000006GE1,I paid over $30 for this VHS tape and it was terrible.  I don't know why this movie cost so much since it wasn't rated like Ben Hur or something like that but for a VHS tape to be so bad used it should not of been for sale.,1375228800,2,223,3.5510204081632653
1194678,5,B000006GE1,"I saw this movie when it debuted on cable many years ago.......
I purchased the VHS as soon as it was released many years ago.......and watched it time after time after time, at least three times a year since.
As soon as it was released on DVD, I went out and bought it and went home and watched it....again........and again......and again.

This movie is that damn good, it's like a good book, you just can't put it down.....well you just can't stop watching this.

Judd Hirsch is excellent...
Kate Nelligan is just over the top as the distraught mother who has lost her child in the blink of an eye.....
David Dukes is the Ex Husband...also a fantastic acting job.
Stockard Channing as the friend who tries to be there for little Alex's mom but the weeks of no leads puts a strain on their friendship when she tries to give advice.

If you were one of the lucky ones to get this movie on DVD while it was on store shelves, good for you, hang on to it for dear life because it may never wind up there again.

Those of you who are complaining about the jacked up price?, if you want it bad enough, BUY IT, it will not disappoint, otherwise, try flea markets, garage sales, where ever, but do what I've been doing, keep googling it, eventually, it'll be re-released in an anniversary edition....patience is a virtue.

This movie is even closer to home for my cousin John Fahy's step daughter dissappeared in Philadelphia, PA in July 1988 and was found that evening in a Television Box bludgened to death. It was not until July 1993 that they caught the killer after it became a cold case file.

Having my first young daughter of my own at that time who was just under 2 years old, we learned from the movie and Barbara Jean Horn Story that parents, caregivers, family and friends wait to long to notify police. I assure you with all that happened, we wast no time today calling 911 when a baby or toddler is missing.

The movie was excellent and hard to get. I wonder if they will air it on TV this night because of the Etan Platz 33rd anniversary.",1337817600,,980,4.258064516129032

When I first saw this movie I was about 12.  I'm not sure why it effected me so.  When I saw it a few nights ago I caught that the parents had been separated for only 3 months.  I was thinking it had been a long time ago.  The movie just drips with loneliness.  The mother waking up in the bed by herself.  Even though the son & mother have breakfast together you can't help but feel the loneliness.

Even though I cry everytime I see this movie I love it.  I am also struck by the music.  My husband laughed when the mother was practicing the piano.  He said ""no one plays like that.""  The mother was shown learning a new song note by note and as time went on she perfected it and played it beautifully.

This movie is worthy of anyones collection.",1109030400,18,451,5.1506849315068495
1194754,5,B000006GE1,"THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES!! MY 6FT, 250LB FRIEND CRIES LIKE A BABY EVERYTIME HE SEES IT. FOR MYSELF, I'M MOVED BY THE TOUCHING STORY AND THE UNBELIEVABLE PERFORMANCES OF THE ACTORS.  I'M ALWAYS LEFT WITH A SENSE OF HOPE ESPECIALLY LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE INNOCENT CHILDREN DISAPPEAR EVERYDAY.  UNFORTUNATELY, I NO LONGER HAVE A VHS PLAYER (SINCE IT IS THE AGE OF THE DVD!)SO HOPEFULLY, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, SOMEONE WILL HERE MY PLEA AND MAKE THIS ONE OF A KIND MASTERPIECE COME ALIVE ONCE AGAIN IN OUR NEW WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY!!  NEED THE DVD!!",1076025600,3,559,4.514851485148514

7904468,5,B000006GE1,"I (luckily have this movie) I can't understand why (if you want a new copy) it's $249.95, anyway it's an excellent movie about a little boy on the
way to school gets snatched by someone driving by the one block he has to walk to school. I really like this because a good portion of it was
filmed in Bridgeport, Connecticut (near me). Judd Hirsch (Superior Donuts) plays the lead detective and does a good job, good luck finding this even used for about $100.",1513123200,,458,4.4

7904470,5,B000006GE1,Excellent!!  The ending is the best!  Won't pay 65.00 for it though so have to settle for the occasional times it is repeated.,1487203200,,126,4.434782608695652
7904471,5,B000006GE1,I Love this movie. I haven't seen it since the 80's but I remember the tears and emotion. I also remember Kate Nelligan being nominated for an Oscar. I don't understand why a movie from 1983 is over $200.00. Most movies are between $10-$20 dollars. Does anyone know why?  I would love to own this movie. A top 10 for sure.,1478304000,,322,4.278688524590164
7904472,5,B000006GE1,"I watched this when it first came out and was in tears at the end.  I loved this movie and still do.

What I love about it is that the acting is so good and the story line so believable.  Judd Hurst did a wonderful job

SPOILER****************************************

Seriously, don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie and plan to.

The one thing I thought was very odd and struck me as off at the end is that Susan never kisses her son.  Lots of hugs but not one kiss.  It just throws me every time I watch it because what mother wouldn't rain kisses all over her missing child?",1470009600,,593,4.2792792792792795
7904473,5,B000006GE1,"Today is Tuesday, June 28, 2016 and I just watched this movie for the first time during a free 30 day trial of HBO NOW!  I love Judd Hirsch any way but I love him even more after watching him and Kate Nelligan's performance in this film.  I came to good ole Amazon to see if I could purchase it and when I saw the crazy price of over $100 I was like excuse me?  NOT IN THIS LIFE!!  I'm so grateful that I found it in the HBO collection of movies before my 30 days are up which is tomorrow.  My son and I always take advantage of 30 day free trial periods of most things to do with movies and this movie was a gem to watch.  I cried my eyes out.  Fantastic movie.  Loved it.  Just loved it.  Keep your eyes on your babies people.  Keep your eyes on your babies at all times!  God Bless.",1467072000,,785,3.8679245283018866

And will always give it five stars but the price is insane!!! if I was asked to review the sellers a review I would give them 1 star only because I cant give them a zero star rating!!! I have been waiting for a few years for this movie to come out on DVD and will continue to wait as I will never give one of the sellers that much money for any movie no matter how much I like it!!!! Come on people your prices are crazy, its not made of gold!! Its just a movie on DVD. I can get a whole season of a tv show I like for less if not the entire show!!",1461628800,,591,3.6984126984126986
