""Deadly Ransom"" is such an all-out disappointing film that I can hardly be bothered to write a long review about it. If I were lazy, the entire thing could be summed up in the phrase ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Hyatt/dp/B007TNGNFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Hyatt</a>&nbsp;got Loren Avedon for an action movie and then did nothing with him."" As a fan of the man's Hong Kong outings, I don't expect Avedon to be able to recreate his work with Corey Yuen and Lucas Lowe, but I do expect filmmakers to at least strive for something as exciting. This movie, however, is low on all forms of excitement. There's a bit of fighting, but not nearly enough and none of it of good quality. Not even the end showdown with lima-lama practitioner Sidney Liufau (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-3/dp/B00005MM6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 3</a>) is worth waiting for. The shootouts and explosions are small-scale and generic. I should've just watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>&nbsp;again...

The acting is inoffensive but forgettable, even in the case of a legitimate actor like Brion James. Shot in what must have been the most desolate place in Puerto Rico, the ugly brown landscape dominates too much of the cinematography, making the entire movie boring to look at. The story really isn't worth following, filled as it is with characters whose names you won't remember and any number of time-wasting events (e.g. the whole angle with the prostitute who gets blown up). Normally, I'd praise the fact that at least the filmmakers were able to hold the camera steady, but the handful of blatantly unsynched and missing sound effects ruins even this superficial plus: it might have been better if you weren't able to clearly see that the gun is firing to the sound of complete silence.

I can't say much else about this one, other than that I really wish I had my money back for it. It's without a doubt the worst Loren Avedon vehicle I have ever seen, and it's no wonder that I'm the first one to review this. Avoid.",1338854400,2,2968,6.605128205128205
