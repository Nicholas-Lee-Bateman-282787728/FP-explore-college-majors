4254957,5,B0043BNO32,"How do you live with a lie? A lie you swollowed and now your child is dead; wrapped up in a plastic bag and being taken to a dumpster. It was not just a piece of tissue. The ""procedure"" was not painless and you did not just go home and carry on with your life.
Maybe you continued to have cramps and then found out you were still pregnant. You had only aborted one of the twins. You are shown it on the sonogram. The surviving baby is in it's sack. You see the empty one beside it.
Maybe you have turned to drugs and alcohol. More nights on the town and another abortion. This time it is not the bottle or cocaine it is a razor blade to your wrists. You know what you have done and you can live with it no longer.
But this video is a message of hope. It is one of forgiveness and redemption by the One who created you and your child in His own imag. He is the one who will forgive and redeem you if you seek Him out and confess your sin.
That is the wonderful story of this video. We can never forgive and redeem ourselves. We are all guilty. The One who knew you before you were born, He will save.",1285804800,6,1099,3.9327354260089686
4254958,5,B0043BNO32,"I love this DVD.  If you have any questions regarding what abortion is really all about and how it affects both men and women, this DVD tells it all directly from people who have suffered the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual consequences. It's a wonderful, down-to-earth look at abortion, with an upside - filled with the hope of healing, restoration and new life.  This DVD has been a tremendous blessing to me and I believe it would also be a tremendous blessing to anyone seeking answers.",1359244800,,500,4.8023255813953485

Recently, after I gave a lecture,  a student presented me with an article by an abortion nurse.  One paragraph in the article caught my attention.  The abortion nurse said that the claim (and I paraphrase) that the pain in the abortion procedure can be horrendous is a lie.  She said also that any claim that there are lasting effects is a lie.

Well this movie called Life After Abortion puts the lie to this abortion nurse's claims.  Numerous women are interviewed who testify, some weaping as they do so, that the pain during the abortion was horrendous.  Also, they testify that the physical problems including hemorrhaging afterwords was very abnormal.  Some would phone back to the clinic for help only to be told ""that's your problem"".  Sadly a number of women lost their lives who never were interviewed.  The staff at the clinic had been so warm until the abortion began, and then the warmth turned to ice.

Most of these women talk about the lasting emotional and spiritual scarring.

This DVD is a much needed service to the many women who will fall for the lies of Planned Parenthood and other abortion facilities who will advertize abortion as a safe and reliable procedure, and after it's over, ""there's no more worries"".  These are the lies.

Carol Bennett who once owned 3 abortion facilities reveals how the staff of these institutions ensure, through sex ed programs in the schools, they will always have a steady supply of teen girls coming to their clinics for abortions.

It is a travesty.  But the DVD does a great service in revealing so much of what is kept quiet in America and given such a veneer of respectability.",1353801600,3,1796,5.141379310344828
4254960,5,B0043BNO32,"As a pro-lfie crisis pregnancy counselor for over nine years, I have read a lot of information and seen a lot of videoes on this subject and I HIGHLY recommend this DVD. 'Life After Abortion' is comprehensive and honest. There are no graphic pictures and contains no judgmental or condemning dialogue. (There is one inaccuracy in a reinactment but it's minor.) This DVD covers everything from what abortion has done/is doing to our society as a whole to recovery to adoption. It is packed with good testimonies and interviews and anyone who has been touched by this subject in any way will benefit from this DVD.",1341273600,2,612,4.783018867924528
4254961,5,B0043BNO32,"Life After Abortion is a very accurate representation of the secret torment of the abortion wounded heart.  The women and men on this film give a voice to the millions who have lost their voices because they have been gagged and silenced by the guilt, shame and grief caused by their abortions.  From one who has walked this journey from bondage to freedom,and as one who walks alongside many others on this journey, I am thankful that this film brings the hidden things to light.  Through Jesus Christ there is healing and lasting freedom for the abortion wounded heart.

4254962,5,B0043BNO32,"Life after abortion has no commentary.  We just listen to women tell their stories about their experience.

If we heard from only one witness, we might think that she is describing an effect personal only to her, but one that is not common to the process of abortion.  Many others have had abortions, but they are doing just fine.

But as we listen to many women explaining what happened to them, we begin to understand that they are all experiencing the same emotional effects and that many are experiencing the same physical effects.

We learn that the effects of abortion are physically and emotionally devastating, and that the devastation continues through life.

I just buried my 95 year old childless cousin.  She had no family to attend to her, so I sort of became her son. She was very angry with God.  In her last days she revealed that early in life she had an abortion and that precluded her from ever having children again.  We did not know how deeply this affected her life until we first learned of it a year ago.

The film also reveals the deceptive programs used to entice women to chose to perform an act that will have such devastating consequences for the rest of their lives.

This is a film that everyone must see.

It can change entirely the way you view the world.

4254963,5,B0043BNO32,"""Life After Abortion"" is a beautifully filmed documentary about a horrible reality: the inevitable pain, guilt, and thankfully, in the longer version of the film, the healing God offers those who turn to Him. I highly recommend it to anyone who is unfamiliar with the after effects of abortion on women and families. (The DVD comes with the long version that includes post-abortion healing, the shorter more secular version and 13 extra special features.--Well worth the price.)

The public has had 30 years of exposure to what abortion does to unborn babies. But too many allow themselves to ignore that reality believing abortion is a necessary evil that ultimately helps women. Life After Abortion documents that it not only does not help, it actually hurts in a much deeper, profound and life long way that an unwanted, unexpected pregnancy could ever cause.

FOR THE PRO-LIFE PERSON WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD SEEN IT ALL:  A wonderful bonus to purchasing the DVD of Life After Abortion is inclusion of 13 touching special feature vignettes on other aspects of the abortion issue told by individuals who lived through them. Some are 2 min., some 5 min., one 7 min. Great for showing during a meeting or to introduce a topic at a meeting.

One is about Planned Parenthood. One about a young couple suffering through a pregnancy they know will end in the death of their daughter. One about a young woman who had 7 abortions before turning her heart and life around. One features our former Kansas A.G. Phill Kline, who as always, is eloquent on the subject.

My favorite, entitled ""Conceived in Love"", features a woman who was raped, gave her child up for adoption and was contacted by her years later when she was moved to search for her birth mother to ""bring her to Christ.""  ""No, no""....her mother responds to the new voice on the phone...""Julie, is that your name? No, no honey, you see, you already did that.""

Wow. Thank you Brian and company for your dedication in committing these  faces, voices and real-life stories to film where I have no doubt they will help young women, parents, pastors, and us all.",1286323200,13,2111,4.78021978021978
4254964,5,B0043BNO32,"Thank you, thank you for putting this documentary into our hands.  You have the courage to tell the world the affect that abortion has had on all of mankind.  Abortion hurts women, men and destroys lives and families.  As a woman that chose abortion for my first pregnancy at the age of 18 in 1978, I am very grateful for this video.  You have shared the truth which needs to be heard.  I have shown this story to many friends and will take it to other countries as I go to share my testimony of God healing those that have been imprisoned with the shame of abortion.  This story needs to be heard and seen worldwide.  Thank you again Brian and Carrie for speaking for those tiny babies who cannot speak for themselves.",1286150400,16,719,4.360902255639098
4254965,5,B0043BNO32,"So says Revelation 12:11...and this important and extremely well-produced video demonstrates just how powerful a person's testimony can be.  Producer Brian Barkley has made a very important contribution to the struggle to defend life as well as tell the truth about abortion.  (Hey, isn't that what true ""choice"" is all about?  Knowing both sides of the story before making a decision, particularly one of such magnitude for the ""fetus"" as well as for the woman herself?)  Every person who cares more about truth and people's well-being than they do sloganeering and ideology need to watch, get and share this video.",1285977600,5,616,5.13
4254966,5,B0043BNO32,"Wow, was I blessed and in some instances saddened to listen to the real life stories in this film ""Life After Abortion"". The stories are so moving, so emotional, so poignant, and so relevant to uncovering the very real lie and deception of Satan that we currently and legally parade as ""Pro choice"", instead of the truth and reality of what it really is - ""taking the life of one who is not convenient to us"". This is the ""real inconvenient truth"" in our world  today - that of taking the life of someone because it is an inconvience...which in many instances is exactly why abortion takes place. That and the profit that Planned Parenthood and others benefit from.

Throughout time God has called men and women who were willing to be used by Him, men and women who He knew would do the work He wanted accomplished. I believe God has called the producer of this powerful film to expose the truth about the pain, tragedy, and lie concerning the practice of abortion worldwide. This program which chronicles the stories of women and men who have been caught in Satan's deception is so very powerful, and I pray that people around the globe are positively impacted by watching this program, that more lives are saved and that there is real healing and forgiveness that takes place for those individuals who have had abortions.",1285804800,7,1323,4.64957264957265

I knew this was a powerful message when I viewed the finish product and saw the common threads running through all of our stories.  We did not all know one another, we were not told what to say, we were just told to share our stories.  I was struck by how much I had in common with so many women and how we had all endured the trauma and the pain and survived to finally try to heal and tell our stories so that others could join in the healing, MILLIONS of others.  There is something wrong in a nation that discards an average of 1.3 million of its offspring over a period of over 40 years.  This film is about healing and about changing the way we look at something that is politicized as a ""right"" that is safe, and in the process shielded from the truth that it has been hurting women, men and families for decades.",1493424000,,1027,4.115
