7993346,1,B00009W35P,"Interesting idea but was pulled off with next to nothing budget. A ""city of the dead"" is discovered in Egypt and the local corrupt ruler decides to turn it into a Westworld-style amusement park....with reanimated cyborg mummies. The director makes heavy use of models and miniatures instead of CGI, and the costumes look right out of the local Halloween store.

A bigger budget, creepier, darker version of this plot would have made a pretty decent movie. But the campy approach the writer went with isn't taken far enough, and ""The Mummy Theme Park"" is left in a limbo between action/horror and wacky comedy - not doing either well.",1447027200,,633,4.861111111111111

7993348,1,B00009W35P,"This movie is a shocker and should be avoided. It has a weak script, poorly acted and the visual effects would easily be surpassed by any child with six months experience on a computer. To say that it is amateurish is a gross understatement.

I bought my copy after reading excellent reviews on Amazon. UK and thought it was worth a look at. I have seen the movie twice now because I couldn't believe how bad it was the first time round, not because I'm a glutten for punishment. My judgement stands that it is absolute rubbish.  I regret having spent my hard earned money on the item and hope those that apprecieate movies made to a reasonable standard will heed my words and give this movie a wide birth.",1149292800,4,706,4.423076923076923
