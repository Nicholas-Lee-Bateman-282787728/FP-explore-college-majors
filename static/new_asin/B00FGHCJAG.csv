5991716,4,B00FGHCJAG,"It appears that this 2009 Munich Festival production is the 'product' of Richard Jones.
I don't know what is Mr. Jones's conception of this beautiful work apart from what's being stated in the liner leaflet of this DVD.  If that outline is how Mr. Jones conceived this work, am much afraid that he missed out the most important human aspect of this opera - FAITH. And this is not to say that I was bitterly disappointed that the Lohengrin, no less than the highly expected Jonas Kaufmann, appeared on stage in track suit and sport tee, and the Princess Elsa appeared in workman trousers.
My own benchmark of this most romantic of Wagner's works is the Bayreuth 1982 production, with Peter Hofmann in the title role and Karen Armstrong as Elsa.  Since the time of Peter Hofmann, there has not been any tenor who could muster the same degree of conviction on stage portraying the Knight of the Holy Grail. Jonas Kaufmann is the FIRST hopeful.  But alas, I would only say that this 'matter-of-fact' styled production robbed in entirety the opera of its romanticism and lyrical drama.
Musically, the bridal chorus sounds grossly inadequate.  And I have a feeling that Kent Nagano allowed the music to drag, resulting in some vocal wobbling in most singers, especially the low male voices, and affected members of the chorus.
The only saving aspect of this production is of course without doubt the two lead singers. I would say that both Kaufmann and Anja Hertaros rank among the BEST in their respective roles since the last decade. Hertaros is in both the visual and vocal aspects reminiscent of Astrid Varnay, while Kaufmann, though not necessarily a heldentenor (especially in larger houses), owns an instrument that, if he guards it properly with due care, would be capable of interpreting a number (but not all) of Wagnerian roles to great acclaim. The fact that this production presents him as a 'man in the street' is the greatest shame.",1274745600,61,1941,4.81981981981982

5991723,5,B00FGHCJAG,"All are gifted interpreters of their respective roles, and Jonas Kaufmann takes the elad. More evil in Ortrud is called for.

What is not good is this silly production that has nothing to do with the Kultur Lohengrin comes from. It is like setting ""Turandot"" in Peoria, Illinois. No, this is not the way to go. I noticed that many astute reviewers spent more time on the bad priduction, and did not have an experience of this opera that was in any way very positive. I agree. The production is like a continuous cough all around you. Why don't designers listen to audiences remain silent or boo when their absurd upodates are revealed. I saw the La Boheme on HD in a local theatre from the Met. recently. Every act was wildly applauded before the action began. The production debuted in 1982. Franco Zefferelli.
 People want the ""You Are There Sets"" for these very intense perioid pieces. Listen to the people!

The Lohengrin from the Met in 1984 with Eva Marton is glorious. Peter Hoffmann superb (what a tragedy there) and Leonie Rysanek, unbelievable as Ortrud. Not a lavish production, but a glorious bright light to underscore the presence of the swan which we do see. Its integral to the character of Lohengrin.",1399075200,,1217,4.704225352112676
5991724,4,B00FGHCJAG,"I agonized for several years over whether to take the plunge and buy this DVD.  I was torn between my admiration for the remarkable Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros and the universally negative reviews of Richard Jones's ugly, stupid production.  But since it is the only commercial release in cd or dvd of Kaufmann's Lohengrin, I finally broke down and bought it, and do not regret it in the least.
The production is indeed a pain to watch. The Opera News reviewer called it a blend of Walmart and Oktoberfest (I would substitute Home Depot for Walmart, since we see the future and short-lived home of Lohengrin and Elsa in various stages of construction as the opera progresses, only to be burned down by Lohengrin in Act III when Elsa breaks her vow and asks him who he is). I find Kent Nagano's way with the score rather pedestrian, but the singing is on a consistently high level, and the close-ups allow one to forget the ugly staging at the crucial moments in the opera. Kaufmann, as expected, is simply astonishing.",1397433600,4,1023,4.6464088397790055

5991726,1,B00FGHCJAG,"A couple of good points in this opera are both Jonas Kaufmann who is outstanding as a tenor in the Lohengrin part and for Elsa of Brabant, the soprano. Now for the negatives of this. The stage director and stage costumes are despicable. The stage setting for the opera stinks. This is normally a beautiful opera but with showing brown uniform characters that depict the Nazi era of Hitler's Germany is a disgrace to Wagner and to the  cast and setting of this particular version of Lohengrin. The swan should have been highlighted much, much more than it was with Jonas Kaufmann. Not enough emphasis on this and way, way too much  on the brown uniform Nazi type of Germany. I donated this DVD to my local library because I could not stand to view it a second time around.",1391644800,6,771,4.5
5991727,4,B00FGHCJAG,"Weird seeing Wagner's Lohengrin in modern dress and seemingly set in the 1920's, once you get used to it that really doesn't matter because with any Wagner operas what matters is the music and the singing, in this version the singing is totally superb, Jonas Kaufmann as has been said before is the successor to Jon Vickers, he is the epitome of a Wagner tenor, lots of power extremely pure tone and he can act, he is the tenor of this century what is more he can sing anything, I have him as Cavaradossi in Tosca and he sings the mezza voce just as brilliantly as the high powered notes, Anja Harteros is Elsa and what an Elsa she is absolutely brilliant a truly fabulous soprano with the power and the presence made for Wagner, Wolfgang Koch is a Telramund who really is demonic in his demanding the charges against Elsa, Michaela Schuster is a really nasty piece of work as Ortrud, the way she goads Telramund into trying to destroy Elsa is frightening in her actions that really show that she is going to do whatever it take to destroy Elsa, the rest of the cast is just as excellent. The only thing I can say about the orchestra under direction from Kent Nagano is absolutely brilliant. Once you get used to the modern dress this has to be the cast and the production that Wagner himself would have chosen.",1383696000,6,1311,4.443983402489627
5991728,5,B00FGHCJAG,"The first time I watched the first act I thought ""Oh no, this is Munich and the brown shirts are back!"": I had expected a more traditional staging of ""Lohengrin"", obviously. The beautiful overture with Anja Harteros designing her house was intriguing and heightened my interest and expectations. Jonas Kaufmann's pianissimo rendition of ""Mein lieber Schwan"" was deeply moving as was his ""Gral"" aria. Anja Harteros' Elsa was enchanting with her gorgeous voice and expressive eyes. I thought that all the lead singers were extremely gifted and I enjoyed their performances. I'll be watching this one many more times and would recommend it.",1382659200,6,637,5.194174757281553

5991732,3,B00FGHCJAG,I am a great fan of Jonas Kaufmann and his singing of Lohengrin is what I'd hoped.  But the production is beyond ridiculous--makes Kaufmann look like Jed Clampett.

5991733,5,B00FGHCJAG,"Wagner's Lohengrin is perhaps his most overtly 'romantic' opera. Indeed, it is the quintessential 'knight in shining armor/damsel in distress' story. But like its other Wagnerian cousins (and direct relative, Parsifal) there are many layers of meaning at work in Wagner's text. Musically, this is his most brilliantly scored work, full of brassy fanfares and rousing choruses.

And in every way, this is an outstanding musical performance. The American born and trained Kent Nagano, Director of the Bavarian State Opera, leads a performance that can stand comparison to any recording I have heard. His cast, many of them home grown favorites, is headed by THE great singer of our time, Jonas Kaufmann, whose voice, technique and temperment are ideally suited to the role of the Swan Knight.
Only one tentative attack on a pianissimo high note slightly mars an otherwise unimpeachable live performance, introspective, anguished, and heroic by turns.

Anja Harteros, a German-Greek soprano whose star has been rising in recent years, plays Elsa as a visionary at odds with her regimented surroundings. She is fully immersed in the role and perfectly suited to the vocals demands, as well. Wolfgang Koch and Michaela Schuster are well matched as a thuggish Telramund and his blond gun-moll Ortrud. Friedrich is a notoriously ungrateful role, easily descending into stock moustache-twirling villainy and cruelly high in the voice. Koch is more than up to the vocal demands, and is wholly credible as the villain who is also a victim. Schuster, as his wife, is all eye-popping, sneering, malice. If she does not erupt with quite the volcanic force of Christa Ludwig, well, who else does?

Christoff Fischesser, one of a bumper crop of young German basses, may seem a bit callow as the warrior-king Henry the Fowler (the one historic figure in the opera, father of the founfer of the Holy Roman Empire), but he sings Heinrich's demanding part with finesse and detail. The King's Herald, here a significant presence in acts one and two, is excellently proclaimed by Evgeny Nikitin

The Bavarian State Opera Chorus is the equal of any, i.e. The Met or Vienna, opera chorus in the world, as is the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra.

As to the production: To those ""all-rude dank word-sayers"" who decry anything resembling a modernized staging I say ""Shut your mouth and open your mind!"" I know every bar of this opera well, I own scores, both full orchestral and piano reduction, and I speak German fluently. I am also both a trained opera singer and trained in theater production. And I am telling you all that this is one of the most intelligent, well-thought-out modernized productions I have ever seen. Not a single detail is not clearly without meaning in the context the director, Richard Jones, has devised. Yes, perhaps we miss Lohengrin's entrance in gleaming armor. But if we understand him as man living a preternatural life, desperate to find his way to a normal world and fit in, then his appearance in a baggy t-shirt makes perfect sense. If he is not drawn onstage by the swan, he is at least carrying it, and this becomes an allusion to his father, Parsifal's slaying of a swan as an ignorant youth. The building of the house is a metaphor for the building of a Society, and when Lohengrin is betrayed he burns that house, leaving the town a series cots, like a homeless shelter.

All aspects of Ultz's designs are similarly integrated: The Brabantian (Bavarian?) costumes gold uniforms yielding to Lohengrin's blue t-shirts; the wedding ceremony  mingling blue and gold sand in a vase; the Herald `broadcasting' from a tall chair to TV screens; even the quote from Wagner (Here, where my delusions find peace, I name Wahnfried, my home) integrate into a thoughtful gloss on Wagners score. To dismiss all regie-theater out of hand is as reactionary and luddite as those forgotten 19th Century critics who declared Wagner's ""Music of the Future"" as an ill-fated aberration.",1345248000,7,3977,4.989441930618401
5991734,3,B00FGHCJAG,"A wonderful performance, all the singers are fabulous, especially Jonas Kaufmann as Lohengrin. However, I cannot say a good word for the producion, that is the work of the director. He put this highly romantic and religious story of Richard Wagner into the 20. century and the time of Hitler. The plot has nothing to do with that whatsoever,  and the production is absolutely abominable. A waste of very good orchestra musicians and singers.",1331856000,6,441,4.95945945945946
5991735,1,B00FGHCJAG,"I wish that the trade in option was available when I purchased this DVD.  The cast is excellent especially Kaufmann.  The production is another example of trying a new, more modern setting.  It sucked.",1327622400,10,201,4.852941176470588
5991736,4,B00FGHCJAG,"Surrounded by a bunch of hitlerian S.A.looking Brabant soldiers, Elsa is laying bricks in a cheap looking vacation bungalow under construction.  Lohengrin who is depicted as wearing a shiny armour arrives, sporting jeans and an untidy T shirt which is a good idea as he will later help Elsa and paint a door. He carries a stuffed swan in his arms -perhaps in view of the following night's dinner- while a tennis referee on a high chair seems to act as the herald etc...

Mr. Jones,If you are thinking of Parsifal for your next destruction (oops production) why not set it in Africa with Parsifal and Klingsor throwing coconuts at each other and the Graal knights dancing in grass skirts and bones in their noses?

If one can bear this sad result of the time's growing illiteracy, the reward is a magnificent cast of voices, Jonas Kaufman perhaps the best Lohengrin since L.Melchior, Anja Harteros a beautifully sounding Elsa, an outstanding Wolfgang Koch as Telramund, a superb Herald by Evgeny Nikitin, only Michaela Schuster's Ortrude is not always as brilliant as the rest of the crew. Kent Nagano's direction is flawless.

And how does Brabant fit into this unsurpassed, unmitigated mess?

5991739,3,B00FGHCJAG,"Nikolaus Lehnhoff is a producer/designer/director whose work has been familiar to me for decades.  He has moved from early, beautiful scene settings and vivid directing in to pure Regie re-interpretation of the stories of the operas.

He broke off into this post-industrial, retro-fascist-bashing phase in the late 1980s with his Ring cycle in Munich, brilliantly cast and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.  This performance is available inexpensively on EMI.  No libretto but it's a keeper in my collection.  I think there is probably a film of this show out there in Europe but not in America.  This is not a problem for me because Lehnhoff's shows are not visual experiences I much care for.

This Lohengrin from Baden-Baden was a 'risk' buy for me.  I wanted to hear the remarkable Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin and see Waltraud Meier's Ortrud.  I also wanted to know what kind of Wagner conductor we have in Kent Nagano.  The answer is:  excellent.

I enjoyed this film in spite of the Nazi overtones, overtones that have become very hackneyed and boring in the hands of the Regie-maniacs.  I like non-horns-cuirass and bear-fur Wagner productions.  The flawed execution of Chreau's fascinating Ring at Bayreuth in 1976-81 was beautiful and not at all controversial now as it was at its notorious premiere.

Lehnhoff's sets are not especially annoying as they are so bland, and his micro-managing of the actor's produces fine results.  Best of all the singers are mostly excellent.  None of them sing less than well and one of them, Vogt, seems ideal as the ephemeral white knight, slightly robotic and inhuman, as Lehnhoff sees him) but an angel when it comes to beautiful lyric singing, and he never shows a single dot of strain or fatigue in this very challenging role.

Solveig Kringelborn's voice is slightly hard and vinegary but she is capable of beautiful soft singing on top, and she is an excellent actress.  When it comes to acting, though, it is Waltraud Meier's riveting, intense work as Ortrud who steals the show.  Meier is a phenomenal stage creature.  She is made to wear some outlandish feathers and slinky gowns but she is beautiful and physically gracious and triumphs over the obstacles set before her by the production team.
A very great filmed operatic performance.

Tom Fox is a handsome fit neurotic in the American vein and he has a strong virile baritone of great power and volume.
He too is a fine actor and keeps up with the high standards set by Meier's Ortrud.  Roman Trekel has never been what I'd call a top-drawer voice and his acting is very stiff and self-conscious.  But he sings well enough as the Herald and the dull grey suit he wears like a straight-jacket is apt for his impersonation.

Hans-Peter Knig is better cast here as the avuncular king than he was as Hagen and Fafner in Thielemann's recent production at Bayreuth.  Knig's voice falls into the category of beautiful bass but not with the black basses we associate with the darker Wagner bass roles, like Kurt Bhme and Matti Salminen.  Knig would probably make a great King Mark in Tristan.

All told, the monolithic wall and great stairway in Act I do not distract or enrage.  It is a neutral set which is fine in a Regie production.  Lehnhoff never gets in your face like, say, Calixto Beito or Peter Konwitschny.  Act 2 is the same set, ostensibly.  The Bridal Chamber in Scene One of Act Three is a bridal chamber that looks like a bridal chamber, which is nice because it could have looked like Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory with Kringelborn looking more like Elsa Lanchester than Elsa von Brabant.  Lehnhoff's direction of the singers is at its peak in this scene.  Kringelborn's Elsa really weedles Lohengrin into annoyance and she reveals herself, now that she's got her man, as a manipulative shrew who will not let it rest until she has dug out all his secrets, rather like Judith in Bluebeard's Castle.  I liked the comical touch in this scene of having Lohengrin playing bits on a white grand piano which is a reverse piano, high notes on the left, bass notes on the right hand.  And Vogt clearly has excellent facility playing the piano, which helps.  He is entirely convincing as this strange arch-angel come to earth, and he's good-looking to boot.  Scene Two is all the more poignant for her depressed regret at her truculence at not obeying Lohengrin's warnings about prying.

The orchestra plays beautifully and Nagano has a fine regard for the more delicate aspects of this beautiful score.
He doesn't drown the singers in the big parts and his tempo choices are perfection, under the circumstances.

So why only 3 stars.  Well, I'd give it four if the singing was a notch up.  Aside from Vogt, none of the singing could be considered Great.  Meier's voice has heard better days, it's vinegary now but not unpleasant at all and her top notes ring out fully in this role, as compared to her Isolde where her top notes are strangulated more often than not.  But then there is her superb acting ability to carry her into greatness.

Added to this is the basic drabness and nihilistic aspect of Lehnhoff's vision.  He is always nihilistic these days and that too has become a clich in Euro opera productions of this type.  Fascist military overtones pervade the entire production (meh). It really is about time we move on from that as it has been way overdone in the past 30 years and it's time for a new tack in Wagner opera production

But I prefer this kind of neutral politicized setting to the Richard Jones complete re-interpretation in Nagano's other filmed performance of this opera done in Munich with Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros.  I love both those singers and would like to have them, especially together, in these roles.  But I haven't yet be able to justify the silliness of the photographs I've seen of this show and the sense that I wouldn't want to watch it more than once or twice.  I liked Richard Joneses Ring at Covent Garden in 1994 but that was a more humorous mythology (Fricka's beard!) than a political tract.  But Jones has gone full-regie in the Munich Lohengrin and I view this with a very jaundiced eye and haven't popped for the dvd.. yet.  The jury is still out.

This Baden-Baden show is recommendable if you have some discretionary play money, love Lohengrin and are open to non-traditional productions that won't piss you off.",1287964800,5,6386,4.76775956284153
5991740,5,B00FGHCJAG,"This is a fabulous performance, captured with state of the art video and sound.  The updated ( to Germany of the 1930's) staging is sensible and does not get in the way of the glorious music.  The conducting and cast could hardly be better.  Jonas Kaufmann is the most compelling Lohengrin I ever expect to see or hear.  Beautiful sound at all levels and movie star looks with terrific acting.  Harteros is no less satisfying.",1284249600,6,426,4.626666666666667
5991741,4,B00FGHCJAG,"Even reviewers who dismissed the direction of this production as ""eurotrash"" tended to admire Kent Nagano and the musical values; and the power of the acting and singing of Jonas Kaufmann, Anja Harteros, Wolfgang Koch and Michaela Schuster.  I think that they are all marvellous.

Where I have trouble is with the realisation of the director's concept.  Instead of a dreamy passive Elsa waiting for a protector, we have a strong woman who knows what she wants:  basically a family of her own and stability.  Lohengrin too is after much the same thing -- presumably the sterility of Montsalvat was getting to him.  That is understandable.  But this is symbolised by the building of a house which progresses until the roof is put on at the beginning of Act III.  It is a huge house and requires many workers toiling away in the background (and sometimes the foreground with with wheelbarrows and bundles of bricks) -- and it is all too too busy and distracting as the drama of the opera and its conflicts unfolds stage front.

That is unfortunate because the conflicts are so stark and the performers are so good.

On the other hand, all this building, and obvious need of Elsa and Lohengrin for each other within their home, leads inevitably to its loss and the tragedy of Act III.  I have never seen it done so powerfully and with such pathos.  Kaufmann's despair and interpretation of the music is a marvel -- as is that of Harteros.

The other twist, with which purists might disagree, is that Elsa does not die.  (I have seen this before in Herzog's Bayreuth production where, if I remember correctly, Elsa and Ortrud join hands as Gottfried appears just before the final curtain.)  Here, with the appearance of Gottfried, Elsa puts away thoughts of her departed husband and invests herself in Gottfried, her recovered brother, and the  presumed stability to come.

All told, I found it a most emotionally absorbing and stimulating production.  There are many many strengths which put it above other productions.  But if only there were not so many busy obvious workers bustling about the stage.  That (reluctantly) takes away one star.

P.S.  I should have mentioned that I have made comments on the reviews of AMY and Dankwort.  If you are interested, there they are.",1283385600,20,2272,4.798969072164948

She's good, but if you remember Christa Ludwig or Ursula Schrder-Feinen, or going further back, Margarete Klose ... Well, enough said.
Now the bad news (but not all bad). The Regietheater production has a few things to recommend it (e.g., a beautifully staged bridal chamber scene), but the nonsensical clothes worn by the chorus and Kaufmann's blue T-shirt and track pants ... Richard Jones, what were you thinking??
What I thought was striking was the juxtaposition of the two beautiful, black-haired outsiders against the Aryans (Schuster as a Nazi dominatrix). Of course, this only works with these two particular singers.

An imaginative production need not be banal or misconstrue the text.  Wagner's Lohengrin does not require this kind of reinterpretation which is a diservice to the composer's vision and to a masterpiece.
  The soloists are vocally spectacular.  Jonas Kaufmann is the best Lohengrin of this generation and possibly of the past half century. Anja Harteros and Michaela Schuster are authoritative interpreeters of Elsa and Ortrud in this most beautiful score. The remainder of the cast, the chorus and the orchestra under Kent Nagano are simply wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the recording.  I highly recommend, turning the visual screen off so you don't have to experience the disjunction that exists between the text and music, and what you are seeing on the screen. Whoever saw Lohengrin, instead of riding a swan, walk in carrying a stuffed dead swan in his arms? What are Lohengrin and Elsa doing laying bricks in the middle of the day? The performance goes on and on like this for the 200 minutes that the opera lasts. Since so far a CD version is not available, I recommend you buy the DVD, turn off the visual, just sit back, close your eyes and enjoy a most memorable Lohengrin. We don't need to see this travesty.

What is not controversial, however, is the praise and enthusiasm for the performance musically. As much as I enjoyed Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin on Opus Arte, Waltraute Meier';s Ortrud and Kringelborns' Elsa (until pressed to produce spinto tones which are not hers to give) I would have to award this set as the ""best"" Lohengrin on DVD. The reasons are not hard to find. Jonas Kaufmann is an artist without peer; not only is he musically intelligent, has artistic impulses that I have rarely enjoyed in the tenor voice. The fact that is handsome and is a superb actor are pluses which will make this artist a ""go to"" man for many roles. He has the ability to cross vocal lines from Don Jose, and Werther, the Berlioz Faust and Cavarodossi, and Florestan. On YouTube there is a clip from Swiss TV of the Student Prince; the music may be kitsch but Kaufmann elevates it by treating it as worthy of the effort he would put into an operatic role and there is no trace of an accent. In the Decca Carmen he was clearly comfortable with the dialogue. And wonder of wonders he is a tenor who knows the value of singing softly. In fernam land is sung very softly, a hushed mezza voce, so nuanced that one almost things he is singing it for himself. Glorious.

His Elsa is equally gifted; she is able to bring to the party what Kringelborn and Armstrong couldn't: a lush spinto tone that is never stressed or shrill. The voice is a beautiful one and for those who have never heard it YouTube did have (or maybe still) clips of the Strauss' Four Last Songs. Her repertoire is equally as varied as Kaufmann's, from Mozart, to Verdi and Wagner. She is clearly comfortable with the produdtion as are the remainder of the participants. I have no doubt that if she wasn't in demand before this release, she will be now.

The remainder of the cast is excellent and the choral contributions maintain the same high level that the soloits bring to the performance. Leading all the participants is Kent Nagano; this is his second Lohengrin on DVD; the earlier performance was equally as glorious as the Munich set. Thank God I don't have to choose one over the other since I already have the earlier set. Munich Opera has provided a number of performances that have been preserved on CD; I hope that his is merely the beginning of what could be a happy partnership between the company and DVD technology. The archives alone are mouth watering, e.g., Frosch, Arabella, et.al.

What is controversial about the set is Richard Jones' concept. Two reviews I have read on line are essentially positive: Classics Today (Robert Levine) and Opera Today. For those interested in joining the fray Google ""Lohengrin/Munich/2009""; I did not care for Jones' production of Hansel but then I am not that crazy about the opera. Lohengrin, however, was the apogee of German Romantic opera combinging myth and politics. In a sense they are in this production although most detractors are already hauling out the ""Euro-Trash epithet. It is time to put this word to rest. To my mind it suggest that those who use it are unable to make a cogent remark concerning the work. This is not to say there are no bone headed productions that will irritate, aggravate and upset any number of auditors. But generally a fresh and unorthodox take on any work of art that is being recreated iis healthy for the art form. I can easily recommend this DVD for those with an open mind; others will have to weigh the positive elements against the production values that will doubtless upsset some opera goers.",1277424000,17,3658,4.6682170542635655
5991746,1,B00FGHCJAG,"I apologize for that what follows being also my reply to a previous reviewer. I wanted to be able to grade the performance as well.  He gave it 4 stars so my one star averages to a more reasonable 2.5, still way too high in my opinion.

I don't have to see the actual production to have seen and heard the worst. This is very plainly one of the most egregious, perverted, fraudulent examples of ""Regietheater"" (""producer opera"") that I have yet encountered. The producers should be sued for false advertising. This is NOT the Lohengrin that Wagner wrote, but a sick figment of the producer's twisted imagination. It doesn't matter how good the singing, playing or conducting is - this is a DVD, not a CD, and so not in the least a legitimate performance of the composer's opera. Avoid producer trash like this like the Plague if you want to understand and appreciate this beautiful work.

Wagner was in exile in Switzerland when he finished the work, and he had to get his good friend Franz Liszt to stage it, I believe in Dresden. He loved it dearly, pleading with Liszt to use his influence to do so. This dvd abortion is a slap in the face to the composer and every present and potential Wagner lover.

Fortunately there are a number of alternative dvd's available of this work.  Go to Amazon & read the reviews  - best way to expose phony art like the above.  Sometimes you can't even trust the album cover to give you a true representation of the staging.  Or check out several Netflix dvd's if they're available.  That way you won't be stuck with trash.",1277424000,37,1559,4.5

I'm not making this up.  This is the last production I will ever purchase from the Bayerische Staatsoper.  Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!",1503187200,2,288,5.266666666666667
8615594,5,B00FGHCJAG,"This is the rare video where the musical values cannot be faulted. Jonas Kaufmann and Lohengrin are a perfect fit between singer and role. His dark, baritonal timbre and introverted, even aloof personality fit the Wagnerian knight's music like a glove. He is of course idiomatic in the Germanic language and also sings with real tenderness and legato in his scenes with Anja Harteros (Elsa). Likewise, Harteros, who can seem passive and detached when singing Verdi roles is wonderful as Elsa. Her voice has a soft-grained quality that sounds youthful and naive. She's not a natural actress but her face registers a quiet intensity that works perfectly in this role. Michaela Schuster (Ortud). has an unusually plummy, rich mezzo and so there's no shrieking. What's more, her long scene with Elsa is sung with a buttery sweetness that's creepy and very effective. Wolfgang Koch rounds out this excellent cast as Telramund. Ortud and Telramund in this production have a deeply sexual bond.

Richard Jones' production might not be to everyone's liking. It's set in the 1930's and all of Brabant is busy constructing houses, apparently for a perfect utopian society that we know can't exist. I however like the production because despite the sets (construction housing) and Jonas Kaufmann in a t-shirt, the story of Lohengrin is followed. Lohengrin even arrives onstage with a swan. The story is the same -- Elsa pins her hopes on a stranger and it can only end in tears.

Since 2009 Kaufmann's voice has become precarious, cancellations more frequent. However he recently returned to the role of Lohengrin and had a big success. This video is a great souvenir of his portrayal.",1485129600,5,1674,5.017985611510792

8615596,5,B00FGHCJAG,"Production is minimalist, but I liked it. Kaufman signing ""In fernem Land"" is worth the total cost -- perhaps the finest performance of a male aria I have ever heard. Acting and signing is excellent throughout, whether or not you like the style of the production.",1478390400,2,263,4.739130434782608
8615597,3,B00FGHCJAG,"I tried to like this production. But I didn't. I can tolerate a goofy staging though I prefer the traditional. This just doesn't cut it. I get the whole build a house motif but there is no emotion in this opera. It is flat from beginning to end.

Harteros is superb despite the lousy costuming and silly positions she is put in. Kaufmann cannot act. His sword fight is pathetic. He looked absurd. He never seems connected with this staging.

Now comes the line that will be heard around the world...or at least by people reading these reviews. Kaufmann doesn't deliver in the singing department. His voice conservation technique is making his approach more of a falsetto than diminutivo. He brings nothing to this production. It looks like a rehersal and he sings like it.

I think Kaufmann might do better in a more traditional staging where he can be a part that he can feel. Having to act a bricklayer while being a mythical knight is beyond his acting ability. Fot that he is to be forgiven. Buying this DVD for Kaufmann will disappoint.

The orchestra and superb support from the king of Brabant and chorus keep this from being a total sleeper.

I want a rematch! Try this same cast in a decent production and I would bet you would have a hit. Except skip Schuster. The only evil her character projects is from the sloppy lipstick she sports as Ortrud. Koch is comparably mushy as Telramund. Fischesser makes a decent Heinrich though again, the staging makes it tough for the characters to know whether they are in opera or improv.

I would like your comments. Seriously, am I off base? Or does Kaufmann fall short?",1473984000,3,1620,4.607638888888889
8615598,5,B00FGHCJAG,"This is my favourite LOHENGRIN, not just for the always impeccable Kaufmann-Hartetos pairing but also in Kaufmann's revelatory aria, towards the opera's end, that's sensitively and powerfully sung and it's so incredibly well-filmed that it heightens the emotional impact and totally draws the viewers into this momentous scene. I've rarely been that moved...",1467072000,,358,5.773584905660377
8615599,5,B00FGHCJAG,"Kaufman's voice is above anything I've ever heard. Many of the reviews here have been very critical of the set. For *Wagner purists*, that criticism may be so. But I approached this DVD as a first-time Wagner listener almost (I'm more of an Italian opera person), and I found it a breath of fresh air. I have always found Wagner's settings so baroque, dark and loomy (is THAT what they are supposed to look like?) that I can't bear more than one act. But this Lohengrin is fresh and luminous and so romantic! (Compare with Placido Domingo -- can't believe the acting for a second). For me it opened my eyes to a different Wagner, so I HIGHLY recommend it to those who, like me before, thought that Wagner is a ""dark"" composer. Perhaps that was precisely the intent of this ""travesty""? (And I'm not sure who sees Nazi costumes in the set, I didn't see any Swastikas ...) I really do NOT recommend to approach music with a purist attitude because you might be missing out something ... ;-)  Always approach art with an open mind and you'll enjoy it more!",1460505600,,1052,4.479166666666667

It's a pity that the wonderful performance of the singers is spoiled by modern scene and ugly costumes. On the other hand, I was impressed by a symbolic level of this production. It consists of the concept of this story like building a house. In my opinion, this is a strong idea.",1459641600,,415,4.859154929577465
