 i liked this set but felt it wasn't as good as some others. while the quality is good some of the movies are not.some may like it better than me ,so i have to say it's good just not the best.",1146009600,2,245,3.6037735849056602
2125324,1,B0002V7S2U,"This is an extremely shady, sub-par operation, cost-cutting at every opportunity, resulting in every disc being scratched, most so badly that they freeze the DVD.  In the end you will be able to see about half of the movies all the way through.  The others will freeze the DVD halfway through, or not be playable at all.",1107648000,39,320,4.5964912280701755

8032903,3,B0002V7S2U,"I'd been loving all the cheapo fifty-packs of hercules films, of horror films, of cheesy sci-fi films, crappy westerns....so I figured what the hell, why not a cheap pack of films not so dead-set on exploitation. Well, I didn't like them as much. Exploit my bad taste, it's quite forgiveable that the prints are rough to poor. But to watch idly serious stuff and telefilms, I think if theyr'e to be tolerable at all, they need to be better prints.",1394496000,,447,4.6
8032904,4,B0002V7S2U,"I have 10 or so of these 50 packs from Mill Creek; this was the first one I bought.  Some of the films here are found on multiple sets of Mill Creek and many are easily available from other sources as well.  There are a few titles in this set that I have never seen available in any other way though, and that made it worth the money for me. Also, it's an easy, inexpensive way to get a lot of movies at a low price. I was able to get rid of a lot of individual boxes and save storage space. Some of the movies are better than others, but that is true with any set of films ever put out, from these 50 packs to the box sets of major star collections.  In this set , I thought the quality of the prints was very good; some of the other sets, especially those  featuring older titles can have prints that are in not very good shape.  Again though, I have never paid more than $15 for a set, usually less,  which makes the movies very inexpensive.  At these prices,  the occasional clinker or bad print isn't such a big deal.",1305331200,,1022,4.024752475247524
8032905,2,B0002V7S2U,"Haven't seen all the movies yet.  So far, about 66 1/3 are o.k.  But for the price, can't complain.",1240963200,,99,4.157894736842105
8032906,5,B0002V7S2U,"I highly recommend this set. Yes, I will conceed that the quality is just okay...these films were not remastered. But as a fan of the TV movies from the 70's I love this set!!! I was a pre-teen when most of these movies were on the ABC Movie of the Week, and I recall most of them fondly. I bought this set basically for ""Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring"" with Sally Field. I can remember so clearly being in my pajamas and sitting in the living room watching it on the only TV we owned a 19"" B/W portable set (with an antena on the back of the set.) I can't tell you the thrill of watching it again- If you don't expect the perfection of remastered DVD quality, you will certainly enjoy this set.",1202688000,5,699,4.109489051094891
8032907,4,B0002V7S2U,Fans of old and rare movies and TV movies will love this pack of double-sided DVDs featuring famous actors in early roles.  This is the kind of stuff you may never have a chance of seeing on TV from any source because  they are off the radar.  We love it--and have bought other collections from the same source.,1201046400,9,311,4.327586206896552
8032908,3,B0002V7S2U,"I have had no problems with my discs freezing up or not playing. They play fine in both of my DVD players. No scratches at all on the discs. I enjoy these type of movies, having seen many of them as a kid, back in the 70s so it was entertaining seeing them again. I basically got the set for one movie, ""The Death of Ritchie"" which I was not able to find on DVD. The packaging is pretty cheap and these are dual-side DVDs, but I was not disappointed with my purchase since they all play fine. Maybe I just got lucky with my set.",1185062400,9,528,3.990566037735849

8032911,3,B0002V7S2U,"Compared to the other sets in this series, there are only a few once well known films now in public domain which lift the general level. On the other hand, there are a plethora of made for TV movies, some quite good, some quite well known for a while after they appeared. As usual, there are many minor films of major talents though they were mostly TV talents.

From my perspective, one who seeks escape from the daily news and its problem focus, and wants to enjoy an interesting but not too depressing hour or two with films, this does not make the grade. Let me emphasize, if you like plots dealing with crime, drugs, marital infidelity, poverty, prejudice, and, whatever, you will find much good fare here. If you prefer something with which to while away an hour or two with a light mystery, comedy, romance with some laughs and no real intensity, go elsewhere. It reminded me of the television fare of the late sixties and early seventies, the world is filled with woe.",1167436800,16,976,4.545454545454546
