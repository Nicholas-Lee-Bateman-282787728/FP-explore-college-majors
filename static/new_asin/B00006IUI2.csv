1778095,5,B00006IUI2,"THE STORIES OF ZATOICHI ARE JUST GREAT TO WATCH. GREAT ACTING , SWORDPLAY, DRAMA AND COMEDY. WHAT HE EXPERIENCES IN HIS LIFE IS SHOWN ON HIS (SHINTARO KATSU'S) FACE SO WELL....YOU COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HE IS FEELING IF THE SOUND WAS OFF ON YOUR T.V. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY ACTORS CANNOT DO.",1377475200,,295,4.584905660377358
1778096,5,B00006IUI2,I am a big fan of Shintaro Katsu and if your into samurai movies then check his movies out and see what you think.,1370390400,,114,3.7916666666666665
1778097,4,B00006IUI2,"There's really no such thing as a bad Zatoichi movie but this stands out as one of the better ones. In order to know the history between ""Tane"" the woman he was in love with you really had to watch the first two black and white Zatoichi movies. Even if you don't know the history it doesn't matter it's still a good movie with a good story and a good sword fighting scene toward the end of the movie. In the end it's really touching that he finds out that it was ""Tane"" who really betrayed him the woman he was so in love with. Like I say there's no such thing as a bad Zatoichi movie not the best in my opinion but definitely worth buying. A good movie with a good story and plenty of action.",1354233600,,693,4.028985507246377
1778098,5,B00006IUI2,"I'd bought the box set 1 - 4 and I've just seen this episode 4 - it's probably the best of the first 4 and it's in color!  I seem to remember the previous ones being in black and white?  Well, the technicolor transfer to DVD here is just dazzling.  The colors are rich and full, and with the viewing of this episode 4 I've come to realize what the Zatoici pictures are - minor works of art.  Each scene is a painted picture of imagery and color.  And as I mentioned, this Episode 4 ""The Fugitive"" may be the best in the box set, and not only for it being in color but for the story as well.  To tell you the truth, episode 3 ""New Tale of Zatoichi"" had rather put me to sleep, beautiful as it was.  In episode 4, not a long episode, things move faster and there are a couple of exciting scenes which make this episode one of the more memorable.  The picture ends with rather a tear and a smile.  Works of art. Not a bad place to start with Zatoichi.",1303516800,,948,4.0
1778099,3,B00006IUI2,"This 4th episode of Zatoichi begins with a more comical sendup than in previous episodes. The charactor traits Shintaro Katsu would eventually define as Zatoichi have now become more ingrained in the personality of Ichi, and the following episodes will only reinforce the humorous, beloved, cane-sword weilding, blind masseur and ethical man to the audience. This episode is enjoyable, as ALL of the Ichi episodes are. The film begins with a price on Ichi's head; and an inexperienced swordsman by the name of Kisuke, tries to claim this reward. He fails of course, and as he lays dying he informs Ichi that his mother Maki, is with the yakuza.

Therefore, Ichi embarks on a trip to see the mother, and inform her what has happened. However, she does not resent Ichi, as she understands that it was in self-defense. Also, reprising her role in this episode is Tane, the woman who loved Ichi [episodes #1 and #2]. Tane is now with a samurai. [I will not tell you about her character, as it will spoil the film for those who have not viewed it] There are many characters in this particular epsiode, with many subplots going in different directions. The cinematography is excellent as usual, and Zatoichi does flash his sword in a wild ending. An enjoyable watch. [Stars: 3.5]",1157328000,,1273,4.786363636363636

1778101,5,B00006IUI2,"One of the best in the TV series. Zatoichi shows his skill by cutting a cup in two and caught everybody by surprise. Soon, a samurai is eyeing him for battle. Watch out for the end battle.",1092873600,,188,4.108108108108108

7969628,1,B00006IUI2,"Why did they decide to ruin this series?  I watched 1-3 and thought these movies are awesome!  Cool story although the romances were getting Weird and old really fast, but I got to this movie and I have no idea what happened.  It is almost like they made it into a cartoon and jumped about 50 sharks.  It is like a slapstick comedy now.  I am Zatoichi, it is hot, I can't stop sweating! I am so dirty!! LOL!!!1 I am also now a champion sumo wrestler even though it has never been mentioned before.  He has a price on his head because someone put one there...that is seriously the plot, no explanation as to why I could see.  Any get this, it seems that not a single woman in Japan can resist the blind, dirty man who spends long moments grinning like an idiot and sweats enough to cause the drownings of 3 extras.  It has become a children's cartoon and made me sad that a series that began with such promise falls flat on its face.... (Yes, that is a Zatoichi joke)",1468281600,,966,4.211956521739131
7969629,5,B00006IUI2,"Great treatment and entertainment.  As in every chapter, production, setting, action and, development of simple tale are excellent!  As always, based on a clear moral  principal. It must be admitted that consequences of failure to heed it are certainly very harsh.  Star and role could not be more perfectly matched!",1466812800,,316,5.26

7969636,3,B00006IUI2,"Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) walks into a mess as the yakuza sects of a certain area jockey for position and a mysterious samurai arrives with an old flame of Ichis in tow.  This is the first film of the series that fails to completely satisfy me.  Katsu is still great and there is an interesting plot thread concerning a weak man who is placed in a position of leadership.  However, I was confused by all the players in the yakuza politics and the introduction of Ichis lost love seemed tacked on and unnecessary.  I suppose it is inevitable that such a long running series of films would develop a formula but it is disheartening to feel that I was seeing the tropes of the formula beginning to congeal.",1435881600,,703,4.511811023622047
