8701819,2,B00THX0T98,"We have attempted to watch 2 of the movies so far with poor results.  Convoy had several dropouts and poor sound, but interesting pic so I tolerated it.
Commandos would start with poor qualty video and sound, then stopped playing all together.  I tried this on 3 different DVD players, with similar results.  Other DVDs worked fine.
Will check rest and see if same results.",1437955200,5,373,4.707692307692308
