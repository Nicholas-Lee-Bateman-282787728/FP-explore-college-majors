A bit slow moving and a tad boring, but all that said, it is good talent within and I would rather see this bundled with another PBS special on Chanukah.",1215561600,2,253,4.361702127659575
8178342,4,B000NJLLVA,"I saw this show years ago on PBS and remembered enjoying it very much.  Theodore Bikel is one of my favorite actor/singers.  He acts as host, telling the story of Passover as well as singing a few songs.  As with most holidays, there aren't a great many different songs for the holiday, but the various ways in which ""Dayenu"" is presented, are wonderful.  The modern take on ""Dayenu"" sung in the style of Paul Anka's ""Diana"" was great.  There were also some Ladino songs, not as well known to most Ashkenazim.  The older woman giving a cooking lesson on matzo balls is a kick.

This show is pretty much a companion piece to PBS's ""A Taste of Chanukah.""  In that one you get songs and a latke cooking lesson.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was just a little slow moving.  Entertaining, but slow.  By the way, I am not Jewish.  You don't have to be to enjoy a concert.",1205798400,5,878,4.286585365853658
