8132591,5,B000GI3KUS,"This excellent drama revolves around the story of a gorgeous blonde who refuses to accept the hand of the man to whom she was betrothed while she was an infant by her parents and is sent to a convent to prevent her from eloping with her lover, who finds herself becoming the center of affection of a nun who hails from a rich family - who due to the  magnanimous contributions of her family to the church, is granted special privileges in the convent and, consequentially, has common tristes with her lover and frequently holds lesbian parties for the nuns residing in the convent, and becoming the object of the nun's infatuation, desire and love, only to spurn the nun - even though she had utilized her privileges to arrange a triste between the former and her lover, and, having done so, finding the nun arranging for her lover to be killed, and finding herself with child, and, surprisingly, discovering the secret being concealed by the Mother Superior, who like the other nun, had also fallen in love with her, and together with other nuns of the convent, conceals the identity of the child's mother from the church and arranges for her to leave the convent to spare her from persecution, thus, spurring her to devout her future to being a cloistered nun devoted to a life of helping people in need.

I loved the story line and scenery.",1391299200,2,120,4.714285714285714
8132593,5,B000GI3KUS,"The loss of No Shame Films is a true tragedy for Euro Film fans for they seemed to specialize in Italian Cinema that was never introduced into the States either over looked or never picked up for distribution.  They had great liner notes and special features with either the craftsmen behind the camera or the actors still living. I bought this release over 5 years ago because it contained three of my favorite Euro actresses: Eleanora Giorgi, Catherine Spaak and Suzy Kendall.  What I did not realize was here was a true jewel saved from the forgotten vaults over in Italy.  Supposedly a sequel to the infamous 'NUNS OF SAINT ARCHANGEL'-1972 also directed by Domenico Paolella, 'THE STORY OF A CLOISTERED NUN'-1973 is based on factual accounts which makes the events even more stunning.  The story has everything genre fans thrive for: treachery, arranged marriages, sexually frustrated men and women and debauchery all behind the convent walls of Mother Church.  Giorgi is confined to a nunnery having refused marriage to a suitor arranged by her parents when she was a mere infant. Pining for her true love, she comes under a sexually tensioned web between the Mother Superior played by Suzy Kendal and Sister Elisabeth played by Catherine Spaak in one of her best roles which ultimately ends in the demise of the convent.  It boasts stunning images by cinematographer Armando Nannuzzi who lights the sets with brilliant film noir tones.  The beautifully orchestrated score by Piero Piccioni is the icing on the cake, majestic yet shatteringly simplistic , in short, a masterpiece.  Director Paolella directed in many genres along with Producer/Screenwriter Tonino Cervi who also directed many Spaghetti Westerns.  This film emerges as Paolella's most compelling achievements.  No Shame presents the film in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with optional English or Italian dialogue with subtitles, a 20 minute interview segment called 'SEX BEHIND THE VEIL' with actors Umberto Orsini and Eleanora Giorgi, both Italian and US theatrical trailers and a poster with a flip side of excellent liner notes from writer Richard Harlan Smith.  Not to be classified in the sleazy Nunsploitation genre of films, this work is in a class by itself and a fitting tribute to the women who gave their lives and souls to Mother Church for what it was worth.  The true nun of the film was never beatified or given sainthood which makes the story even more tragic.",1345593600,2,2443,5.01980198019802
8132594,5,B000GI3KUS,"The used DVD was in excellent condition. The movie is full of color, great scenery, and has an English option. This is the story of a woman who, as a child, was betrothed to a male child. As a young woman, she fell deeply in love with another man. Her family sent her to a nunnery at which she was exposed to strict discipline, harsh punishments, lesbianism, and political intrigue. This nun movie actually had a good plot!",1302912000,3,423,4.435897435897436
8132595,4,B000GI3KUS,"First, let me be clear - I love exploitation/grindhouse/sexploitation movies - I grew up during that irretrievable era, and loved every friggin` minute of celluloid sleaze I could feast my eyes on. That said, I also love a GOOD movie and Arthouse film as well, unlike most of my grindhouse brethren. This movie falls into that catagory- it has a good story, realistic dialogue, great sets and costumes, a plot with a decent ending, and the leading actresses are gorgeous as well. It is also a factual story based on actual texts found in an Abbey centuries old. And for me, there was just enough nudity for this type of movie as an added perk. No, this is not ""Alucarda"",""Images In A Convent"",""Sacred Flesh"", Malabimba"" or ""Satanico Pandemonium"", all of which ARE true nunsploitation flix, which I also own and enjoy. This is more like ""Flavia The Heretic"" or ""The Nuns Of St. Archangel"", movies that have aspects of exploitation within them, but are much,much more than that but, unfortunately, for lack of better classification within genre`s, get grouped together with other,lower class exploitation (remember, I`m a fan). So, if you can look past the lack of a lesbian scene, which appears or is aluded to in almost EVERY film made between 1969 and 1976 (within reason), you might just enjoy this film - I did.",1253232000,3,1314,4.81858407079646

8132597,2,B000GI3KUS,"Although the young female star of this film is extremely attractive...Capt. Freaky is very disappointed in this Italian 'farce'!

There are no lesbian scenes, no hetero-sex either...this film barely makes it past PG-13.  The fact that it was released on to DVD should have never occurred.  What is the point of '70's Euro Sexplotation films if they don't exploit?
I gave it two stars....one for each of the young actresses incredibly beautiful (natural) breasts.

Otherwise...the story gets ""0"" stars from me.  It lets you down on every level.",1208563200,4,543,5.125
8132598,2,B000GI3KUS,"What the heck is going on here?  When you make a film about a cloistered nun and the cover picture even shows a nun apparently putting the moves on a younger woman, you expect at least one good lesbian scene!  But this film doesn't have any!  How can that possibly be?

The beautiful young woman in the photo is the newest nun in the convent, and several of the older nuns cast covetous gazes in her direction as she removes her stylish clothing to change into her nun's habit.  One slightly older nun in particular shows an interest in her, and later even tries to seduce the girl, but nothing comes of it as the girl refuses to comply.  We also see a brief glimpse into this older nun's room where she happens to be entertaining another (nude) younger woman, but again we don't really see anything but that brief glance.

Again, why make a film about a beautiful young novice surrounded by older women and then not include a single good lesbian scene?  I don't get it.",1162771200,38,970,4.410112359550562
