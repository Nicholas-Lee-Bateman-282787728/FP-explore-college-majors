5854360,5,B00DT55P9Y,"Wonderful! Truly uplifting!!! Funny, with serious undertones. A must see. I have no idea why I didn't see this movie sooner. For sure a permanent staple in my library :-)",1381881600,5,170,4.7
5854361,4,B00DT55P9Y,"The story revolves around a young couple whose relationship is strained with the recent death of their son. One night a young woman shows up at their doorstep looking for help after a car accident and claims someone is after her. Shortly after the masked men arrive and the chase begins.
We've seen this formula several times now with people in secluded homes being terrorized by masked assailants but this one's different. It's not as fast paced as The Strangers or even that violent so if you're looking for a bit of action and some gore you might be disappointed with Static. Static is more of a slow burn with more of a focus on the couple's personal problems which at the end you see why that was the focus of the film. In the opening scene you think you know how things are going to turn up but there's a nice twist at the ending which separates it from being just another generic home invasion thriller. Around the 40 minute mark the movie is shot in the dark, which is fine seeing how the power is suppose to have been cut off, but if you're watching this in a well lit  room you might have some trouble seeing what's going on. Other than that the acting and the story is good making it an enjoyable movie to watch. Like I said earlier if you've read the description for the movie and think you're in for something like The Strangers you might want to rent it first before you buy it but it's definitely worth a view...*Side Note* at the time I wrote this review the movie is listed as $23 here on Amazon. I purchased my copy at Walmart for $12",1381795200,8,1552,4.315068493150685

5854374,4,B00DT55P9Y,"It was an entertaining movie for me. I enjoyed it for the drama, it was pretty intense for quite a bit of the movie, even though some of the script was a bit lacking. I was into it... then the ending... The ending was sort of a let down because it was a twist that has been done in a few movies, so I was a little disappointed. Not that it was a BAD ending, it was just not a loud AHA! moment. If you're just looking for something to pass the time and not looking for an epic, instant classic, give it a shot (pun intended). No one but you can judge if you like it.",1527897600,2,565,3.8376068376068377

5854378,1,B00DT55P9Y,"Lucky to get 1 star.  Appreciate the 3+ star reviews in an attempt to save the movie's face.  It all starts with the story.  There is no story throughout the film until the very last 2 minutes when they do a little explanation of why you just sat through 1.5 hours of pure torturous scripting and unimaginative directing.  Can't criticize the acting when they were dealt such a bad card of a script.  From scene to scene there is often pure nothingness... nothing moving the story forward, just one poor directing decision after another.  You can literally list out 3-5 holes, awkward dialogue lines and more per scene, every scene.  I love to give films a chance to entertain... doesn't matter if they have a budget or not, bad acting or not, horribly photographed or not, but when the story is impacted whether in script, editing etc in a such a way where it could have been avoided then I have no choice but to rip it apart. Unfortunately I'm not sure there was a choice in this instance.  :(",1527120000,,995,4.488888888888889
5854389,4,B00DT55P9Y,"I watched this for a second time by mistake because I forgot everything but the ending. They had a great idea but weren't able to do the same with the rest of the film. It's a shame because someone's going to make this what it should have been and reap their rewards. If you're an avid movie watcher you'll be figuring out things early on, having a hard time suspending disbelief, and going to that place where the great ones take you. For the every once in a while viewer, you may be pleasantly surprised and want to find other movies with similar twists and turns. Hopefully, none of you watch this for a second time like myself.",1526947200,,631,4.3559322033898304

5854391,5,B00DT55P9Y,"I really liked this movie, it is creepy not gory. it was well done.  I loved the story.  A home invasion not in the traditional sense, because of the twist at the end.  A couple have lost their three year old son. The husband is a famous author and the mother is in a deep depression. they have put their house up for sale, to move away from their tragedy and they are trying to connect with each other again.  One night a strange woman knocks on the door looking for help and then all hell breaks loose. I will leave it at that so I don't give any spoilers away.  Well acted and good script.  Much better than the average Netflix standard.",1526860800,2,640,4.162601626016261

5854396,1,B00DT55P9Y,"this movie sucked, i can't believe i watched almost all of it, what a waste of time. There's a movie almost exactly like this where the bad guys have pig masks instead of gas masks and it sucks too. This reminded me of this reality show that was once on about 15 years ago called ""project green light"" where they make a movie and the result is a forced,non-entertaining piece of work which is laden with cliche cinematography and scoring and cliche scenes that don't end up working and are ineffective.
 This movie seems forced, and people just going through the motions to get the work done, the story is lame then tries to change things up at the last minute and be ""the sixth sense""",1526256000,,685,4.436507936507937

5854409,3,B00DT55P9Y,"There were too many of this type of movie (and story) about a generation ago and people got tired of them. But, now it's time for a revisit.
If you watch the first scene then you will already know what is going on in this story. The first scene is not some ""out of sequence-scene"" that shows something that we see happen later in the move, it is not a scene out of the husband's novel even though we jump from it to a shoot of the husband finishing his novel,  it's where this movie starts.
When Rachel's hand got cut, we saw red blood come out of the wound. When Addie's foot got cut, what came out of the wound?
Yeah, it's not safe to have a pond on or near your property, but they also had a swimming pool.

5854411,2,B00DT55P9Y,"I would really like to give this three stars but it just doesn't quite warrant it. The filmmakers left too many loose ends, too many things were unclear. ***WARNING: SPOILERS*** Who is Rachel and how does she have these powers? Who are the people who are assisting her? Why does the real estate agent simply accept that they can do what they claim they can do? I realize a lot of horror movies leave loose ends but this one really makes no sense whatsoever.

While not exactly scary, there are some frightnening and intense situations in this that made for good viewing. There are similarities between this and other ""home invasion"" type movies, but it does have a nice twist to the ending that was a bit predictable, but still done well and I would say satisfying. Not that violent as you would think for something like this, but more of a suspense builder. I would recommend this for the casual or not so much horror fan, that likes a decent story, a little nervousness and not all of the gore us gorehounds love. This does start a bit slow, but when it got going, it kept my interest. Guide=minor foul language, no nudity and mild violence.",1504396800,7,771,4.514285714285714

5854513,5,B00DT55P9Y,"If you're like me, a real horror movie fanboy, who seeks out every new horror flick worthwhile, where ever they might be (theatrical, VOD, DVD) than you probably even checkout the trailers of new movies on PPV every now and then. That's how
I first stumbled upon this movie, I saw the trailer on PPV, watching it several times being more than impressed with what I saw, but being how I am still more of a DVD guy I sought out that, opting for that format, seeing how the disc has a commentary track on it, as I still love hearing the filmmakers thoughts during the making of the film, as I am an aspiring filmmaker myself, and when I finally watched the film I was pleased to see that it did not disappoint!

The story surrounds a young couple who escape to a house in the woods to work on their strained relationship, which has
something to do with a past tragedy involving their son.

During this trip they are taken aback to find on their doorstep an unknown young woman (Sara Paxton) who's motivations about being there are mysterious.

The movie basically entails the young couple played by Sarah Shahi and Milo Ventimiglia wondering what this mysterious blonde girl on their doorstep, as well as the unknown masked men who may be following her want, while simultaneously clashing over the tragic events involving their son.

The writing, direction, acting and editing are all topnotch and really well put together, even the haunting musical score is first rate!

The cast, Sarah Shai, Milo Ventimiglia and Sara Paxton are also topnotch, and perfectly cast, which is crucial seeing how there is pretty much just the three characters in the entire movie, and any one false note would standout like a sore thumb.

Particularly good is Sara Paxton playing the mysterious can you trust her or not kind of role, who I've noticed, being a diehard horror fan has been putting an impressive array of genre tittles under her belt, as of late (Static, Enter Nowhere, The innkeepers, Shark Night, Last House on the Left reboot) being more than competent in all of them.

If this keeps up Danielle Harris may finally have some real competition for her raining scream queen title!

So first of all the hints for this film are right at the beginning and scattered through it. Si right away I knew what was going on. The down side is I'm hard of hearing and the sub titles do not work in the 3D version. So the 3D version is defective with it's non working sub titles which really p****d me off. So all through the 3D movie I couldn't understand what anybody was saying. I was right on the status of the characters but I just couldn't put it together. The 2D disk sub titles do work so all I had to do was watch the beginning and end and the whole movie fell into place. If your young and hard of hearing watch the 2D version first with the working subtitles and things will make since. Would I buy this movie again? No, I've seen it before.",1421020800,5,858,3.994186046511628

A strange woman shows up at the door of an isolated house in the middle of the night and tries to gain entry. Something weve seen before, done well in The Strangers, then done badly in poorly made copies. However, this movie quickly establishes a sense of suspense that draws the viewer in. There is a constant feeling of edgy fear, someone possible being just around the next turn in the house or in the dark corners.

5854544,3,B00DT55P9Y,"The plot for this serviceable movie is familar as rain. A handsome couple with emotional baggage being terrorized by an group of menacing outsiders. Why and how is supplied as the film advances. My problem is viewing it in 3D. This film is probably the worse of my collection so far as viewablity is concerned. I can only suspect that the producers released the movie in 3D format to enhance sales. Trust me that would be the only reason. Long narrow hallways and enhanced vista shots (like the driveway into the estate) benefitted from the depth, but inside the close living quarters of the house, most of the background was often out of focus.  Certain scenes would clear up, but shortly thereafter, back to blurred backgrounds.
As owners of 3D bluray players have learned, there is not much visual impact in front of the television screen, as there is viewing the movie in theatres. Most of the wonder comes in the depth perception behind the characters on the home theatre screens. I personally have a 60"" Samsung in my media room. But continually the background is so blurred in this edition that I have to wonder if this title was released in 3D as a last-minute decision.

That being said~~~~THEY could have made this movie special....You know what to expect from reading reviews,... that helped me somewhat.~~~~First, what Realtor is going to go thru that money and expense to rid a home of ""bad vibes.""~~Why oh why, do all the main characters keep stepping on glass?~~~Why, oh why is (slight spoiler)a ghost hunting sensitive taking a shower in the bad vibe house?~~Theres so much more thats annoying,These two main characters cant leave a room to go to the toilet without sharing long kisses on the mouth. Too much.
It must be me...but the surprise ending is more like ""You've got to be kidding.""
I must say that the characters did a nice job of portraying their angst with each other.

5854561,4,B00DT55P9Y,"This was a good movie. It could have been better, however, I still think it's worth watching. The logic and common sense of the main characters is lacking greatly. Basically a couple that is grieving a loss decide to stay in the middle of nowhere with limited protection and no security system. They allow a frightened girl seeking safety from others that wish to harm her into their home in the middle of the night. Instead of leaving immediately for safety elsewhere, they decide to stay. The rest of the movie is the consequence of their decision, and the reasons of the attack. The story is basically a hybrid of The Strangers and The Others. The twist at the end was unexpected. I assumed that certain people were indeed the bad guys when they actually were not. There were a few points in the movie when I felt the urge to turn it off or to resume it later. It got a bid repetitive at times, and was a bit slow. However, I continued to watch because the acting was wonderful. I've always liked Milo's work, and was hopeful that this was also going to end up being a good movie. Thankfully, I was right.

5854565,4,B00DT55P9Y,"I watch A LOT of horror films. I mean a ton. And not just from any decade, country, or subgenre; I watch them all. So after 20+ years of viewing (i.e., overviewing), I feel like I've seen everything. I know all of the common tropes. I know what the plot twists are, I know how the protagonist will act, and I have an idea of how the villain will fair at the end of the film. My fellow horror fans, if you're like me, you're near being burnt out. You want a new story line, you want something that will take you by surprise. But when you've seen it all, it's almost like what I hear being a drug addict is like: You're desensitized, have built up a tolerance, and are alway searching for the ""highs"" like you used to have (for example: ""if only I could be super creeped out like I was after watching Alice, Sweet Alice at 12 years old"").

Sorry for the long lead-in to my review, but I want to give you context into who I am so you can decide whether my horror-film mindset and attitude applies to you, and if it does, hopefully my recommendation moves you to watch Static. And of course, I hope horror fans like me share a similar opinion on this film: It sure has one heck of a ""I didn't see that coming."" Even knowing there was going to be a plot twist at the end, all of the various scenarios I thought of sure as heck didn't pan out to be what this was. I mean, how many horror films feature a home invasion by ""faceless"" fiends? I thought I did all of the ""educated"" math required. I'm glad I missed something!

Then, wish it would last longer.  There are a few serious jumps and of course, you know from the other reviewers that there is a""twist"" coming that you'll not expect.

5854574,2,B00DT55P9Y,"Pro:
1. Creative re-telling of an old film theme; adequate acting; adequate directing.
2. Most viewers were probably caught off-guard by what they thought they were watching. Kudos for writing & directing to pull that off.
3. Although the WWI gas mask seemed rather hokey it did it's job both in terms of the story (we need the couple to be terrified) and audience suspense.
Con:
1. This plot premise has been used in films before, although this film like all the other films have framed (structure, setting, storyline) each of their stories differently.
2. A lot of not-so likely actions by the couple being chased such as stabbing or hitting the assailant once then running off without assuring that person is coming after you. Then there is the always staying close to the place of attack when they can just run away, but of course then there wouldn't be a story. Similarly, the usual less than intelligent hiding behavior.
3. The script was inadequate in telling the backstory of the child's death and the parental involvement. Even at the end it didn't come across clearly. Also not clearly explained was the backstory of the pursuers.
4. Syrupy moralizing at the end that when we're dead it's just a walk across flowered meadows into the blue sky of eternity. A feel good hook that feeds off our desire for immortality surrounded with nothing but a honeyed afterlife, etc.",1383955200,3,1378,4.794117647058823

5854579,4,B00DT55P9Y,"Intense and dramatic with an unexpected twist.  It starts out with a scene that makes you wonder how it relates to the rest of the film, and in the end, makes complete sense.",1383091200,,174,4.2727272727272725
5854580,5,B00DT55P9Y,"Static was a film that I had heard so many people say ,oh there's a huge twist. I can usually catch the twist within a few minutes into a movie. Not this one. I was completely caught off guard in the best of ways.

The acting by Milo Ventimigila and Sarah Shahi was spectacular as the greiving parents of a young son who drowned in a pond on their property..Even though Sara Paxton didn't have a huge role she was effective as well.

This was much more of a psychological drama/thriller than a horror film but there are aspects of terror as the couple are terrorized by men in strange masks who appear when the couple hear static.its a tense game of cat and mouse all the way through.

The last 15 minutes had me going through many emotions and I know I will be thinking of this film long after I write this review. Some people had a problem with the ending I loved it. I have seen films with similar plots but none have effected me quite like this one, for some reason .This is a must for my collection.",1382918400,15,1004,4.21875
5854581,5,B00DT55P9Y,Pretty scary but the ending is what made it so good.  Acting was decent and the whole movie kept you interested.,1382745600,3,112,4.333333333333333

5854583,3,B00DT55P9Y,"Great twist, similar to ""The Strangers"", exciting and well acted, good character chemistry, good story progression, at times it's a bit slow and confusing.",1382400000,,155,5.5
5854584,4,B00DT55P9Y,"Had really low expectations going into this movie, but found myself really sucked into it and I was surprisingly glued to the movie. It has a ""The Strangers"" feel to it, but the twist ending really caught me off guard, but not in a bad way, I really enjoyed it. I am really surprised to find that this movie really hasn't got much attention yet, but I am sure that will change a word of it starts to spread. Not sure if its worth buying, cause as with most thriller once you find out the surprise ending, you never quite get that same sense of excitement the second time around, but this is definitely worth renting. A great popcorn flick!",1382227200,30,639,4.333333333333333
5854585,2,B00DT55P9Y,"The movie is interesting enough but the lead actress is extremely annoying.  It was frustrating to watch her in the film.  She does everything that a person shouldn't do when in her situation.  Due to this, it was very difficult to get lost in the story line.",1382140800,4,259,4.468085106382978
