6131091,4,B00H47IXF6,"Eugene Brown (Cuba Goodling jr.) gets out of prison and goes to a half-way house. He has realized how he has messed up his own life and that of his son. He reaches back into the community to open a chess club, a semi-skill he has learned in prison. At the chess club he mentors kids about life. His involvement in the community also helps him win the respect of his estranged daughter (Rachae Thomas).

This is a performance more fitting for Cuba who has had too many ""B"" roles for his talent. The film is heart warming and inspiring. His message is that life is like chess, you must keep your eye on the end game if you want to win. The film incorporates several chess metaphors for life. If the movie has a flaw it is that I started to get turned off by the overly overt preachy nature. I felt once stated, the metaphor could speak for itself.

6131092,4,B00H47IXF6,"""Life Of A King"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story,  ""inspired by true events"" we are reminded as the movie opens, of Eugene Brown (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.). Brown is finishing his stint of a long prison term (we later learn it was 17 years) and we see him playing chess with another inmate. Upon Brown's release, the inmate tells him ""Take care of the King, everything else follows"". Brown eventually gets a job as a janitor in a local high school (by lying on his application form when he is asked if he's convicted of a crime). The high school kids, most of them African-American, are a tough bunch to deal with but Brown eventually manages to mesmerize them during detention period by teaching them the game of chess. Then one day, the HS principal is tipped off that Brown is a convicted felon, and she fires him on the spot. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,

Couple of comments: first of all, this is the Cuba Gooding show from start to finish, as he is in virtually every single frame of this movie. Second, the movie definitely feels like a modern version of ""To Sir With Love"", as much of the movie centers around Brown's evolving relationship with the high school kids, in particular 3 of the more ""thug-ish"" boys, one of which seemingly having an amazing natural talent for chess. Third, the last half hour of the movie is rather predictable, as the chess club founded by Brown is entering various tournaments, yet it is also the most moving part of the movie. At the end of the movie, we are told what became of Eugene Brown in real life. Bottom line: I went to see this movie with little or no expectations, and walked out of the theatre rather surprised and moved by it all.

This movie opened without any pre-release hype or advertising on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati this weekend. When I went to see it last night, I had a private showing, as in: I literally was the only person in the theatre. That is a shame, as this movie is much better than you might expect. If you are in the mood for a moving urban youth drama that features some great performances, I would readily recommend that you check this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1390003200,25,2326,4.404651162790698

6131113,5,B00H47IXF6,"Life of a King is an inspirational story about kids from a detention class living in the inner city that, rather remarkably, learns chess.  They distribute drugs among each other in class and often refuse to pay attention to the teacher.  Early on one of the students with a criminal background even makes threatening gestures towards the female teacher that results in her running out of the room scared.  However in comes their new teacher (Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character) who just got out of prison after serving for 17 years due to a bank robbery.  He knows how to handle himself in prison and on the streets, so he won't tolerate any disobedience.

Anyway Cuba learned chess from the master (Dennis Haysbert) while in prison.  He became pretty good at it in fact.  He hands his knowledge down to the kids in detention class.  Don't pull out a deck of cards either because he knows some nifty card tricks too!  You're probably thinking ""There's no way these kids would ever pay attention much master the art of chess given their strong refusal to learn"" but well, this film's based on a true story so at least one student learned.  That would be Malcolm M. Mayes character.  Yup he manages to make it all the way to the championship round.

Of course there's struggles along the way.  Malcolm's drunk-sloppy mom and her bad-tempered boyfriend refuse to sign the papers that allows their son to enter the championship believing that just trying to survive the city is enough and that he shouldn't be part of some silly chess game, so Malcom's character- desperate to compete and desperate to escape the rough city- has to forge his mom's signature.

Cuba Gooding Jr. isn't innocent either.  When he was applying for a job at the detention center (or high school) he didn't check the part in the application that asks if he has a felony.  But he has a reason for this- this is the way it is living in the tough streets.  People do whatever they can to survive, even if it means lying.  However eventually the priniple (Lisa Hamilton) finds out and fires him.  The good news is that Cuba can continue training the kids outside of school, and Lisa likes how Cuba's able to make a difference so she comes around from time to time.

There's another important student in the detention class.  The one I mention above with a criminal activity.  He hates chess thinking it's a kids game, and comes up with a plan to rob a gang.  Of course, guess who he tags along?  The student who excels at chess- that being Malcolm's character.  Cuba knows Malcolm shouldn't be hanging out with this student, but they secretly go through with the plan anyway.  However there's a couple storyline holes related to this part of the story.

One, after a certain somebody is shot and killed (I won't say who, no, not one of the main characters) Malcolm sees his fellow classmate lying on the ground bleeding to death after the ruthless student who came up with the plan runs off.  The story brushes this entire incident under the rug.  But... isn't Malcolm an accomplice to murder?  And why didn't the other guy get jail time too?  He was off driving with his girlfriend in broad daylight a few scenes later meeting up with Malcolm.  It was like this entire thing never happened.  Even in a rough neighborhood I imagine it would be very difficult to get away with murder so easily.  And Malcolm didn't realize how lucky he was.  Had he not stayed in the car after a sudden change of plans, it would have been him who was shot to death.  Strange!

Anyway, there's also emphasis on fixing up an old house.  Cuba and his classmates are gradually motivated to fix it up.  Great subplot.  The actual emphasis on chess is hard to believe  of course.  You can't take kids who are against school and society *this* much and suddenly win their attention span with a simple game of chess.  Chess is a game of discipline and mastery and it takes a while for anyone to learn it.  Yeah yeah, true story I know.  Perhaps not everything we see in the film is true though.

The one thing that's somewhat annoying about Dennis Haysbert's character is that he gives all kinds of helpful advice and yet he's in jail.  I'd love to know why he's in jail but they never say.  This means his role is limited to a few scenes, including meeting Malcolm's character later on to prepare him for the chess competition.  I dunno, he felt too important to be limited to such a small role.  Like someone who could motivate the kids in the right direction just as well, if not better than Cuba's character.  Dennis usually plays the kind of character you seek advice from so despite the small role, he still nails a fine performance!

At least the chess competition at the end is pretty entertaining, and the film doesn't bore us with the technical details of chess.  Cuba's description of chess is really good and in fact he makes chess a lot better, especially the meaning he gives behind the importance of the king.  You must protect the king at all costs.  I won't reveal if Malcolm wins the competition or not.  Overall suspenseful, inspirational and moving.  Cuba's character is the biggest reason this film is so good.  Highly recommended.",1481673600,,5189,4.584330794341676

He reaches out and forms a chess club, of all things to teach the young people to keep their eye on the end game and live the life of a king.

6131129,4,B00H47IXF6,"In spite of some weaknesses, I watch this movie several times a year.  It is a real, uplifting story.  Movie only covers his life as it relates to the kids.  There is virtually nothing that indicates how he, an ex-con, supports himself in real estate.  In one scene, the checker board is oriented incorrectly (with the black square on the lower right).  You'd think that in a movie about chess, the board would be oriented correctly in every scene.  It would have been a better movie if the ""championship"" game had been shown move by move so that we, the viewers, could have followed it move by move.  It could have been included in the bonus features.  Maybe the student didn't want to see the master's flaw (over use of the queen) but everyone else would have like to have seen it.",1466380800,,783,4.464788732394366

Chess is a powerful way to expand one's ability to meditate; something the world appears to be in need of. This movie helps youth to understand this concept. It probably won't appeal to youth that live in suburban areas as much, and may even perpetuate negative stereotypes in this regard. But, it is extremely powerful in all other respects, and although it is not a high profile or well funded project (evidenced by some editing issues lol) is acted well and the point comes across easily.

It's amazing how someone like Eugene Brown could live a life of crime and also serve 17 years in prison and still come out from under and help the youth from following his footsteps. This movie has also taught me a lesson to not judge a persons past, encourage them to do better and not judge them if they stumble.

A ex convict is hired as a high school janitor, being paid minimum wage and fighting for a relationship with his two kids are not the only things that worry him.  Ignoring the street life and trying to make all of his wrongs right, Eugene Brown is destined to be a better man and a better father.

Eugene is requested by the school principal to step in and watch of a group of teenagers in detention. His past dealing with the street life equip him to handle the wannabe gangstas and he is slowly given a little respect.

He uses the game of chess to help the troubled teens deal with making the wrong decesions in life.

6131268,5,B00H47IXF6,"Cuba Gooding Jr. is superb, as usual.  Normally I am skeptical about 'true stories,' but Cuba Gooding Jr. is what convinced me to initially give this movie a try as well as the story of the man, Eugene Brown, who chooses to turn his life around from one of violence to one of non-violence - through the game of chess.  The obstacles he faces when he is released from prison at the start of the movie are some of the toughest anyone could face in life, and he manages to respond to them all with incredible grace and patience.  Martin Luther King Jr. is quoted as saying, ""Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted.""  He meant that we will all find ourselves free when we look to those who have figured out a way to creatively respond to the seemingly unbearable oppressive and supposedly 'normal' social environments most of us find ourselves in. Eugene's life story, portrayed in this film, embodies the famous quote of the King.  The film never once mentions Martin Luther King or this quote.  'King' is used to refer to the chess piece. But I am giving you my deeper insight into the Life of a King.  You won't just watch this film and simply be inspired.  You will watch this film and feel uplifted.  Your imagination will take flight as you will find yourself saying to yourself, ""If Eugene could chose to respond that way in his life with everything stacked against him, if he could choose a great big YES to life in the face of all the NO's in his way, I will be able to as well.""  And playing chess will no longer be a board game about war.  It will become a board game about freedom, self-control, realizing you can chose your response to life no matter what, and that those choices can work well for everyone.",1392681600,19,1741,4.4263322884012535

6131271,4,B00H47IXF6,"""This is a king. This is your life. One mistake and it can be taken away."" Eugene Brown (Gooding Jr.) is an ex-felon who is struggling to find a job and relate to his kids. After finding a job as a high school janitor he is asked to watch the detention kids one day until they can find a replacement. When he brings up the topic of chess he begins to change the lives of the ""troubled kids"" forever. I love movies based on true stories, but I was worried about seeing this going in. One one hand a true story with Cuba Gooding Jr, that is good. On the other hand though I thought how many times can they remake Lean On Me? After movies like that one and Dangerous Minds, Freedom Writers, Fame, etc... I wondered how different can this one be. While I have to admit it wasn't 100% different it was very very good and much much better then I was expecting. The best part about this movie is that it stayed just a step or two away from being way to cheesy to be enjoyed but it did a good job of changing things just enough to keep it feeling real while keeping the emotion that it needed. Different enough from the previous ""helping inner city kids"" movies to make it interesting and worth seeing. Overall, very good and never took the over-the-top cheesy way out that so many of these types of movies do. That is a good thing and because of that I highly recommend the movie. I give this an A-.",1391817600,,1392,4.178438661710037
6131272,5,B00H47IXF6,"Awesome. I would recommend this movie to anyone regardless of their social class.  Things in life happen and we have to realize that with each decision there is either a consequence or a blessing.  Both were shown in this movie and the outcome was a lesson learned about life that you will never forget.  Awesome movie.  I rented it, now I'm going to purchase it.",1391558400,,363,4.538461538461538
6131273,4,B00H47IXF6,"Cuba did a fine job providing an inspirational character helping troubled and under privileged kids find focus, hope, and direction through the Chess Club he created after release from prison.",1391299200,,192,5.433333333333334
6131274,5,B00H47IXF6,"With the promotion of movies like ""The Help"", ""The Butler"", ""42"", ""12 Years a Slave"" it was sad a movie of this caliber was not promoted and marketed for all to see. Instead, people choose to spend their money and time on movies that won't touch your heart and make you think.

This movie captured my attention for the entire time as it reminded me of my personal decisions and those that affect all of our black youth.

Wonderful movie and superb acting from Cuba Gooding Jr. Many of his scenes were very heartfelt as it touched home for me.

It was so good that I'm purchasing a copy for my mother to watch in NY.

It's a must see for everyone, especially if you're tired of having movies like 12 Years a Slave re-packaged and sold back to you.",1391212800,,746,4.307142857142857
6131275,4,B00H47IXF6,"I was just surfing through the selections of movies and came across this one.  I have loved almost everything that Cuba Gooding Jr has done so, even though I have never heard of this one, I took a shot.  Boy I wasn't disappointed at all.",1391040000,4,237,4.2444444444444445

6131277,5,B00H47IXF6,Just watched this movie with my husband and 2 sons. What a treat! We laughed and cried. I didn't mind the clichs that one reviewer commented negatively about. It really reiterated everything we have been teaching our boys and they noticed and took it to heart. They are also chess players and could really appreciate the game and the analogies to life.  Wow!  Can't wait to spread the word about this fantastic movie. A must see and purchase!,1390694400,8,442,4.653846153846154
6131278,5,B00H47IXF6,This movie was very inspiring and Cuban gooding Jr did an excellent job. Anyone who finds this movie unwatchable must not have a good bone in their body (I know very strong opinion). I would strongly recommend this movie!,1390521600,3,221,4.6923076923076925
6131279,2,B00H47IXF6,"The stellar acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr and the real life story of Eugene Brown make for a compelling premise. I really wanted to like this movie but the unrealistic dialogue and over the top metaphors spoiled what could have been a far better film.",1390348800,4,248,4.533333333333333
6131280,5,B00H47IXF6,"I do not remember when I saw a film that inspired me so much. If it's true, this guy is an inspiration how someone with so little can help others though something that you would never think of like chess.

The characters are really good and interesting.

The acting is good, Cuba Gooding is a very talented actor, and it shows here.

I loved it.",1390348800,7,345,4.276923076923077
