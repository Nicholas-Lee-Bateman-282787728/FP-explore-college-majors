8356609,5,B0028PUDHU,I am new at Hawaiian quilting and this is a perfect beginner book.,1444608000,2,66,4.153846153846154
8356610,5,B0028PUDHU,"I have long wanted to learn more about the techniques to make quilts in the Hawaiian style. I have a few books on the subject, and tried to make a pillow top recently with results that were not pleasing to me.  This DVD is excellent in both the amount of content and in presentation.  The pace is just right and makes one want to dive right in and get stitching.  The applique techniques would also be applicable for other applique projects, and the teacher also gives an approach to hand quilting which I have never seen presented before.  Eager to try it!  The DVD is not inexpensive, but compared with other available products for craft instruction it is not out of line either.  Highly recommend it for anyone interested in hand applique or hand quilting, and certainly for understanding more about how to successfully complete a Hawaiian quilt project.",1370649600,9,857,4.718120805369128
