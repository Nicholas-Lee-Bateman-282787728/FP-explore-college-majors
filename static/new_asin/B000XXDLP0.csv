Her instruction should be limited to the separate section that she already has for that!  She speaks to you as if this is the first time that you have ever exercised.  I didn't break a sweat, I didn't need to stop to drink water, I didn't have to pause the video to catch my breath.  Although, annoyingly, Gin instructs you to pause the video to do certain exercises over again on your own!  Would this be a good video for a total beginner?  I don't know, but my hunch is that there are better ones out there.",1455753600,,634,4.26890756302521

8230091,5,B000XXDLP0,"I've had this DVD for a few years now, and although I haven't been using it continuously, when I am in the routine I do notice results after a few weeks. For the first few weeks I can tell it's helping me get stronger even though I can't see much of a physical change. When you stick with it, it works--just like any exercise routine.

I love her cheery disposition! It makes the moves a lot more enjoyable than my other DVDs. My only complaint is that the breaks between moves are a bit too long, but when you are first getting used to the order it helps you remember the form and her tips.",1340496000,3,591,4.139130434782609
8230092,5,B000XXDLP0,I enjoy Gin Miller as an instructor. Her workouts are effective without being complicated. Her instructional style is clear and concise. However this is definitely one of her easier workouts - I use it when I need a break from my more strenuous routines. I am not saying the workout is not effective - it's just fairly easy. A good workout to those new to the exercise ball (a.k.a stability or balance ball).,1301529600,5,408,4.602739726027397
8230093,5,B000XXDLP0,"I just did this program for the first time this morning and I was thoroughly impressed!

I am an experienced exerciser who hasn't missed a day in over 11 years. I am also experienced with exercise dvd's/vhs and have over 130 programs in my collection.

This one was right up there!

Gin Miller is like having a personal trainer lead you thru the workout. It's just her and one student who demonstrates the exercises. She shows ways that anyone from a beginner to a more advanced exerciser can do the exercises.

It's 45 minutes but it felt much shorter to me as I was enjoying it so much!

The exercises are challenging but not overly extreme.

I'm really looking forward to my next time working out with this!

 Highly Recommended!",1195430400,20,732,4.576923076923077
