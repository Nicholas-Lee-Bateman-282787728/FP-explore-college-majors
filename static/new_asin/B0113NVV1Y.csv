7324555,5,B0113NVV1Y,"A good movie that captures the essence of the book.  Read the book.  Good acting and very fast paced.  Considering when the book was written, J. Neil Schulman was very prescient in describing current events.",1449446400,3,207,4.857142857142857
7324556,2,B0113NVV1Y,"I was hoping for better production value with a name like Kevin Sorbo on the project, but the lack of it really detracted from what I've been told is an excellent story.",1448409600,3,169,4.3125
7324557,1,B0113NVV1Y,"I bought this because of the glowing reviews I heard nightly by the news guy on a certain internet/radio talk show. He said it was the best movie he had ever seen. My understanding now is that he was paid for that endorsement.

Maybe the book is better. I found the movie to be unwatchable, though I watched it twice--the second time with the commentary on. I've also seen ""The Room"" multiple times, so take that into account when considering my viewing habits.

The audio is awful. I'm sure I missed a lot. I had to keep going back and rewatching/relistening to catch as much as I could.

The green screen work is really bad. The acting was sad. Commander Tuvok and Ensign Kim must not be making much from those convention appearances.

Oh well, the got my $16.95 anyway. Good for them.",1447977600,10,787,4.4825174825174825
7324558,4,B0113NVV1Y,"This is the ultimate kit for fans of the novel.  It contains a PDF of the movie version of the novel, the graphic novel, the DVD of the movie, a Blu-ray of the movie, the movie soundtrack, and lots of special features. The book was nearly prophetic in the '70s, which was a Heinlein flavored story, built around the exposition of the Libertarian school of counter-economics known as ""Agorism"" (the founder of that school, Samuel Edward Konkin III, was a friend of author and director Schulman, one of his lectures is a feature on the DVD).  The film is pretty good for a low budget feature, and has some great cameos by Libertarian Literati, including the author/director (who has evidently learned quite a bit about post-production since ""Lady Madeleines"").  The prophetic story has been updated a bit in the movie, but I found myself wishing that it had been updated even more, and less about revolution and more about day to day counter-economics.  Then again, that would be a lot less exciting with less explosions and such.  Not all of the actors bring the presence and ""A Game"" that Kevin Sorbo exhibits.  The change of location from NYC (in the book) to Las Vegas (in the film) seems to work pretty well.",1445817600,3,1211,4.688679245283019
7324559,5,B0113NVV1Y,"Given the events unfolding in our country(and our world)today,this movie could not be more timely. Kevin Sorbo gives a riveting performance as Dr. Martin Vreeland,a Nobel Prize-winning economist,who sees the American government getting bigger and bigger and the rights of citizens being taken away,and vows to do something about it. Before he can,however,he,his wife and daughter disappear and it is up to his son,Elliot(Christian Kramme)to find them. In doing so,he finds himself in the middle of an out-of-control government and an anarchist underground movement. This is one movie that everyone should see,if for no other reason than to see what happens to our country when the wrong people are put in charge!",1443744000,6,712,5.366071428571429

7324562,5,B0113NVV1Y,"Alongside Night is a fast paced drama / action adventure with significant implications for our future. It's full of great actors and well directed. Instead of relying on special effects and chase scenes it has a well thought out plot structure. The characters are interesting and appealing. You really get invested in what is happening to them. It's based on a novel that came out in 1982, predicting the massive economic problems facing the world now and has been upgraded to fit in well with the present day, futurism that is coming true before our very eyes. I strongly suggest that you see this movie before reading the novel to avoid spoilers, but I read the book when it first came out and still found it entertaining, a damn good movie.",1438041600,12,743,4.679389312977099

As author of the original 1979 Alongside Night novel as well as screenwriter/producer/director of this movie I'm convinced much of the hostility is due to the movie's uncompromising libertarian content, parallel to that in the novel.

Some of the hostile reviews are from admirers of lead actor Kevin Sorbo's Christian-themed movies such as the break-out hit God's Not Dead who expected another evangelical movie from Kevin and were disappointed that this movie isn't one. I will point out that despite Alongside Night not being Christian-themed the plot about a son risking his life to rescue his family (including his parents played by real-life couple Kevin and Sam Sorbo) makes it strongly pro-family-values.

Other hostile reviews are from factions in the libertarian movement objecting to my other writings on topics ranging from intellectual property, to animal rights, to cryptocurrency, to my personal journey from atheist to believer.

Alongside Night was not produced on a studio budget of millions upon millions, which like many other independent films opens it up to criticism based on its production values -- and hostile reviewers seize on this for displaced attacks rather than honestly admitting what about the movie's content -- or its author/filmmaker -- is really upsetting them. I consider these attacks on the movie's actors, visual effects, and plot to be typical trolling by dishonest (and often anonymous) political partisans -- and may even involve professional functionaries of political lobbying firms or security agencies, foreign or domestic.

As the original author -- as well as the filmmaker who made sure crew, lead-role cast, and post-production artists were all professions with credits on major film and TV productions -- I maintain that the charges of amateurish production are flat-out lies.

What else would you expect from a commercial movie adapted from one of the most anti-political novels ever written and turned into a movie by that novel's own author?

7324565,2,B0113NVV1Y,"I expected to see more of Kevin Sorbo. He was in maybe 10% of the scenes. The story, which was hard to follow, stems around Vreeland's son. It was nice to see some familiar faces from Star Trek Voyager, Tim Russ and Garrett Wang. Part political intrigue, part sci-fi, it missed on all counts.",1514160000,,292,4.425925925925926

7324567,1,B0113NVV1Y,"Production quality was marginal.  This movie was clearly presented from a Libertarian point of view, I think.  However, the presentation of Libertarian ""orthodoxy"" seemed so far fetched as to make me wonder if this wasn't satire.  The plot interchanges between a moderately coherent story to declarations of Libertarian positions on a number of topics.  It seemed like the ""story"" was written around a checklist of position statements that they wanted to present.  At least they weren't terribly subtle, you knew what there position was (again, assuming this wasn't satire).  There were a few recognizable faces of competent on screen talent which made me wonder if they were adherents to the philosophy being presented or if they just needed the $$$.  Assuming the presentation of Libertarian positions was legitimate, I can see why they continue to struggle at the polls.",1504656000,,873,5.237410071942446

Neil Schulman. There are Youtube videos by 12-year-old kids that have more professional production values than this movie.  The book could have come to life in a captivating movie if Kevin Sorbo had been able to bring in the production team from his old Hercules TV series, and the script had been written and the movie directed by professionals who know how to capture and entertain an audience.",1503360000,3,769,4.696296296296296

7324594,1,B0113NVV1Y,"This might be one of the greatest bad movies of all time.  I was nearly in tears, from start to finish, due to all the laughter at this mockery of the cinematic arts.  The acting, aside from Kevin Sorbo (who, I'm fairly certain, has since regretted being part of this debacle), was very wooden and seemingly forced.  The product placements (ads/mentions of libertarian ideas/products) was so in-your-face that if you forgot what you were doing for a moment, you could easily mistake this for a libertarian infomercial.  The lack of competent acting and cheap set design can easily be chalked up to the low budget (which, in and of itself is not a bad thing) but it does not excuse the excessive use of libertarian swag.  It was almost as if these props were used to constantly reassure the viewer that they were, indeed, watching a libertarian movie.  Overkill would be an understatement.

Now, the books that most movies are adapted from are almost always better, as many important parts usually need to be cut in order to fit the story into a two hour or less film.  This movie, however, might have one of the greatest disparities in quality between it and the book it was adapted from.  Again, the low budget could have something to do with this discrepancy but it seems more likely that the book's author got in way over his head in order to produce this film.  That author, by the way, makes the wooden performances of the rest of the crew look Oscar worthy.  Perhaps he should have stayed behind the camera or, better yet, behind his typewriter.

After reading through some of the other reviews, I'm glad to see that I am not alone in my critique of this abomination.  I do find it rather humorous, though, that the man behind this mess, J. Neil Schulman, has taken to personally responding to many of these criticisms and INSISTS that anyone posting a negative review MUST be lying.  It couldn't possibly be that opinions opposed to his are valid.  Heaven's no!  At first I thought that this was just a typical artist attempting to defend their work.  When I learned that he had been banned from Wikipedia for repeatedly attempting to edit his own pages (or ones he has a tangential relationship to), though, it became more apparent that he is simply ill equipped to handle criticism.  His departures from logic and heavy reliance on fallacies in attempts to ""debunk"" people's claims only highlight a flimsy grasp on reality, which might help explain his complete disbelief in others finding his work to be far from the ""more-than-competently produced"" film that he claims it to be.

The bottom line is that this movie is beyond bad, and Mr Schulman should feel bad for subjecting others to this nightmare.  I fully expect to receive a reply from him, calling me a liar as well, but that's okay.  It will only further prove how disconnected he is from anything of quality.",1474416000,4,2879,4.6726190476190474
7324595,1,B0113NVV1Y,"Second-worst movie ever. Worst is ""The Room"", but at least The Room is so bad it's good. ""Alongside Night"" is just bad. Of course, if you say it's bad (and many people do) the author/director will say you aren't a real libertarian. He stated that on his website.

I was surprised to see Kevin Sorbo in this. He's not bad, kinda campy but I kind of like him in some things. But even he couldn't save this turkey from the forced screenwriting, clunky dialogue, bad bad bad bad directing, pedestrian and cliched music choices. And all the actors (except Sorbo) were wooden and not believable. They didn't seem like the characters. They seemed like people acting. Badly.

But the biggest problem (as if all the above isn't enough), was the INSANE AMOUNTS OF LIBERTARIAN ""SIGNALING' IN THE SET DRESSING OF EVERY SCENE. That, more than anything, makes this look like something 8th graders made as a school project.

I had to give this movie one star to post a review, but that's being very generous. I think Amazon should add ratings lower than one star for movies like this. Maybe an icon of a DVD being used to hold up a wobbly table leg?

I'm counting down seconds until Schulman responds on here and calls me a ""not true (movie lover, libertarian, human, whatever)"" and/or a FedGov plant being paid to bash his movie. He does that with most of the one-star reviews on here. You know what? A real director would never be caught dead doing that.",1474416000,20,1441,4.573643410852713

7324601,4,B0113NVV1Y,"Penniless Capitalists of the World Unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains of cupro-nickel. ""Alongside Night"" is the finest anarcho-capitalist ideation film ever made that is qualitatively better than anything at the Sundance Independent (read little or no budget) Film Festival since perhaps Space Coast Florida home movies turned into ""Growing Up With Rockets"". I will not criticize production values on a miniscule budget, while admiring the creativity accomplished without money at all. This voluntaryist script has all 77 elements of Dramatic Form for a great film where the antagonist and protagonist are: 1) collectivist stateism on parade and; 2) individualist interdependence being midwifed by current events. ""alongside Night"" peaks a viewer's curiosity about the popularly unknown, yet well developed school of thought of ""Volitional Science"" versus ""Social Science"". The most important element of Dramatic Form is good versus evil, the 2nd answers the question, ""Why should we care?"" Like ""High Noon"" where the antagonist is the town's Apathy, not a bunch of ex-convicts always arriving for revenge on the Sheriff with the Quaker wife; the antagonist in ""Alongside Night"" is the get-along-go-along sheeple. Viewers should find the banality of evil familiar in the ""carbon"" in the Al Gore carbon reduction facility as a higher tech FEMA concentration camp crematorium type of carbon from human beings. The challenge of portraying a resistance movement for freedom and not merely against tyranny, that's twice as hard cinematographically as a mere us versus them. Schulman, Linaweaver, and Producer Patrick A. Heller achieved that. There were almost a dozen associate producers in true agorist anarchist fashion that lived up to Elvis Presley's admonition, ""I'm not making movies unless we can have fun doing it."" This was fun from turning dry references to Nobel Prize winners like Frederich von Hayek and his mentor Ludwig von Mises into demonstration tempura paint PROTEST signs ""MISES OVER MARX"" into current events visual references. Lest you think that just campy, 950 Young Students for Liberty(YSL) chapters in Brazil just toppled a socialist president there led by low budget videomakers with Mises Brazil with 200,000 people in the street demanding competitive privatization of state-run businesses. The hyper-inflation there has Hayek showing up on underground Brazilian coins. Did the Brazilian young people see ""Alongside Night""? There are another 1,050 YSL chapters in the rest of the world, surprisingly the grassroots movement is reaching America last. The kids in 90 nations in Liberty International think Americans are sheeple and wondering what's wrong with us. ""Alongside Night"" is the answer as much as ""Shadow over the Land"" was in 1967 about the ISF or Internal Security Forces replacing a constitutional republic with ""security"" bureaucracy. Oh was it President Obama that mentioned he wanted to fund an Internal Security Force three years ago? Ever look up Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMB)s on Google images. The Revolutionary Agorist Cadre portrayed in ""Alongside Night"" strikes from large hidden facilities (not visually hierarchaical but as a mall marketplace agora), as much as the government attacks individuals for reasons that have little to do with the concept of governing. ""Alongside Night"" is a better than amateur low-budget statement about amateurs taking on bankrupt political professionals that are bankrupting us, and connecting that to loss of freedom. It connects the dots about questions Americans have about the status quo, and provides a libertarian cultural answer you ought to take a look at.

But if you value truth, freedom, and unhindered capitalism than you may have found a movie for you.  To judge an independently produced movie by the big Hollywood standards is illogical and nave.  At this point in our history the powers that be would rather continuously spew out remakes of remakes of mediocre movies to calm the masses and never challenge the viewing public to actually think.  This movie challenges those rules, makes important statements about our failing society and dares one to think.  I am not writing a review to promote this movie to everyone, it's not that kind of movie.

That presents conflictstates do not like to be explicitly demised, hence dramatic potential for confrontation, especially as the plot moves along with Elliot and his new entourage seeking to locate and/or rescue Dad, Mom, and Sis. Its a highly satisfying action story combined with plenty of food for thought, the culminating issue being can an established coercive state be modified as Jefferson wrote, not to be destructive to the rights of life, liberty, or property or is it time for humanity to move on and leave states as such in the dustbin of history?.  Fade to audience. What do we think?

They actually promote the Free Market by having a 16 year old teen hire a prostitute (for sex and all night stay) using gold; then take the teen on a tour of an anarchists free market mall where it advocates the benevolence of prostitution and even the ability to purchase nuclear weapons.

There is a huge difference between having personal freedom and championing morally questionable activities as benevolent.

This is the equivalent of Pro-Choice equating abortions to benevolent women's freedom, rather than a complex moral question that likely should have little if any government control over.

Being free to act does not remove the benevolence of self restraint and self governance.  The story line was contrived and seemed to appeal only to those who wanted to be free to pursue vice without restriction.  THERE SHOULD BE RESTRAINTS, but they should be self imposed.  And while there will be those that choose differently, this narrative is not an appealing case for its ideology for those who are of faith or moral conviction, even if liberty minded.

Prostitution and drugs should be decriminalized not because they are good, but because the alternative of government control is worse.

7324653,1,B0113NVV1Y,"Thats the case with nearly every sort of book that promotes message over entertainment...and J. Neil Schulmans Alongside Night is such a book.

For the record, Im a libertarian-conservative, so Im almost entirely in sympathy with that message. When Ive had a couple more than I should, Im pretty much an anarcho-capitalist myself...which is one of the reasons I avoid having a couple more than I should. So it isn't because I reject the themes expressed in the book or the movie.

Baldly put, in all forms of fiction, entertainment must take priority over message  and theres precious little entertainment in this movie. Somehow I think the people who made it are aware of that; much of the movie is almost painfully self-caricaturing.

Plainly, there wasn't much money in the production budget for anything: actors, sets, props, special effects, professional cameramen, or any of the other essentials of a good movie. Whether it was obvious at the outset that the effort was under-budgeted is unclear. However, the result is seriously sub-par.

So the movie suffers in three dimensions: a script based on a book that isn't a suitable foundation for cinema; a lack of the resources required for the making of a good movie; and a movie made in semiconscious defiance of those requirements. It should not have been made. Having been made, it should not have been released to the general public.

I wish I hadnt seen it. Perhaps the greatest of my regrets is that those who do see it, if they're ambivalent about the liberty movement, will almost certainly be negatively impressed. Given the terrible socio-economic-political mess the U.S. is in by virtue of having abandoned its founding premises, thats beyond regrettable.",1458604800,3,1721,5.021052631578947

There are a few scenes viewers will find gratuitous ( sex, violence...). They are mild but out of place and feel forced,not organic to the story. Seems like Liberty Gold Coins was a major sponsor as their product is in every scene.

This movie was made without the benefit of tens (or hundreds) of milions of dollars.  There are few special effects, although I'd sure like that little laser cutting tool or whatever it was.  There are no fiery car crashes, no blood splattering on walls, no minutes-long fight scenes, and the sound track, which I enjoyed, is not by John Williams with an orchestra of Hollywood studio musicians. I'm reminded of a production of ""A Play's the Thing,"" performed by a company of traveling actors without a single prop or costume or bit of set decoration because their prop truck had gotten stuck in a blizzard.  The audience had to imagine those things along with the actors.  I, we, the audience, absolutely loved it.  Mr. Schulman has done well with the resources available.

As a fan, following the progress of the movie from first learning it might happen and aware through updates of the difficulties of financing and distribution, I was delighted, even amazed, to see that Mr. Schulman was able to clear the numerous hurdles -- and perhaps a few roadblocks -- and actually get the movie made and on the market.  My view of critics is that they should all create the kind of thing they're critiquing and submit it to the world to see how it feels as the critics shred their egos.

Do not expect kind reviews of this movie by liberal critics. For libertarians; however, it's a real treat.  As a movie about freedom, laissez-faire philosophy, sound money policy, and so on, it may well be in a class of one and destined for cult status.",1450742400,3,1633,4.655052264808362

JNS is a wonderfully imaginative author and his book is adapted handsomely for the big screen. It brought me back to my days of reading SEK3 and Heinlein. Alongside Night - The Movie is a memorable contribution to the genre.",1450483200,3,380,4.521739130434782
7324682,1,B0113NVV1Y,"The book, as I remember it, was really great. Maybe it was because I read it in high school, but as I remember it J. Neil Schulman wrote a really good book. Made a real impression on me as teenager. It and Joe Haldeman's ""The Forever War"" were two of the reasons I became interested in Conservatism/Libertarianism

I wondered if it had ever been made into a movie. I did some digging and discovered that it had... but it didn't show up in theaters, I was frustrated about that. It wasn't on Amazon. I was frustrated about that. I wished it would show up on Amazon.

It finally showed up on Amazon.

You should be careful what you wish for..

First, it obviously had a small budget... I mean really small budget... I suspect that the last time I took my two kids to McDonalds we dropped more $$ than this entire movie had. That must have imposed some limitations, but they did a pretty good job of working around them.
That being said... if you ever want to know how video is an entirely different art form from the written word, and why a professional director is vitally necessary to a film,.. you should watch Alongside Night.

Because somebody has taken a pretty good book, a timely book, a book that I really wish more Americans would read, then recruited some really talented actors, and somehow managed to turn out a piece of drek that is so bad, so painfully unwatchable that showing it to prison inmates would be an 8th Amendment violation.

There were a lot of talented people associated with this film. I assume they were honestly and passionately committed to this film's message. Given that, even without much of a budget, screwing up this badly must have taken some serious work. I can only assume that someone (perhaps an inexperienced director...ahem...?) decided they were going to do it their own way and stubbornly ignored the advice of all the experienced film and television professionals who worked on this project. I can not think of another explanation for how horrid this thing is.

Yes, there are plot holes so large that you could comfortably run the entire Pacific Fleet through them.  (I seriously doubt that the tyrannical and oppressive government Mr. Schulman depicts would be rounding up dissident intellectuals for summary execution, but permit Ron Paul video billboards on every street corner.)  Still this is Sci Fi, so you cut it some slack.

Yes Mr. Schulman personal philosophy involves enough logical and historical flaws that you have to wonder if all those stories about marijuana destroying your higher brain centers were right all along... but his heart is in the right place and he gets more right than he does wrong.

Yes, there is enough ""tin foil hat"" material here that this movie alone could supply the world's aluminum needs for the rest of the 21st Century... but to be honest a lot of things are happening in real life that seemed like ""tin foil hat"" material just 8 years ago.

That being said, what should have been, what could have been, an exciting, intelligent, and slyly educational movie with a fun, edgy twist, was turned into a painfully dull, uninteresting, semi-understandable mess.

If you can possibly avoid watching this movie, do so. Do whatever it takes.  WHATEVER IT TAKES.

If someone is taking you over to their place to watch this movie; jump out of the car. Even if it is moving. Down the freeway. At 90 mph. trust me, you will be better off for it.

If someone in your house puts this movie on the TV,  go into another room... and start a fire... a large one...with lots of paint cans and oily rags..trust me, it's worth it. They will probably thank you for it.

If you are captured by time traveling Nazis, and they tie you up, and tell you that if you don't reveal the exact time and place of the D-Day landings they will make you watch Alongside Night... if that is your situation...if that is what it takes to avoid seeing ""Alongside Night""...you swallow hard and tell them ""6:30 AM, June 6, 1944, five beaches in Normandy... Gold, Juno, Sword, Utah, and Omaha...."" and then you ask them for a pen and draw them a map.  Make sure to include the airborne division landing zones in their rear area, and be sure to explain how the landing in Pas-de-Calais is just a diversion.",1450483200,18,4251,4.621513944223108

After taking two years of college history courses and seeing how the businesses of the world have manipulated governments and countries for centuries while the average citizen foots the bill, I can see that this is definitely a possible future.

I don't know. But, please don't watch this. The very first scene had a classroom setting with a teacher saying another teacher was a (female dog)...like what???",1527638400,,333,4.475409836065574
8723590,5,B0113NVV1Y,"Though the book was published in 1979, during the Carter years, I get the impression that this movie (based on the book) appears to predict one way that the government might deal with the skyrocketing deficit and other conditions caused by the current Republican administration. I've watched the movie 1 times so far, will read the book, then watch the movie again in order to get a fuller understanding of the plot. (1? listened to entire movie during car trip, then watched movie next day.)

If you enjoy books in Heinlein's Future History series, then you will probably enjoy this movie (and book). Some of the predictions for the ""near future"" do seem to logically follow from conditions that we are seeing in the Evening News. For example, I have already heard rumbles of ""Not Our Debt"" from people who hate the idea that our kids and grandkids will be paying for this administration's record deficits. That ""Not Our Debt"" protest was a key scene in the movie.

Because these predictions seem to be becoming true even today, I am sure that many ultra-conservatives will be very unhappy with this movie, especially when the issue of unbridled inflation shows up early in the movie. However, Trumpublicans should not blame the author for attacking the Trump, since the book was written during Carter's Presidency.

It's a strange movie (and I'll have to read the book to understand it better). But I enjoyed it enough to give it five stars. When watching a movie inspires me to read the book then watch the movie again, it deserves five stars.

The Amazon blurb says:
""In a collapsing near-future U.S., brilliant high-school senior Elliot Vreeland's search for his famous missing economist father and family puts him between an out-of-control federal government and a revolutionary anarchist underground.""

INTERESTING NEWS CYCLE?

When you watch the movie, do read the news scrolling across the bottom of various TV screens. It will give you some insight into the rest of that future society. Those broadcasts appear to be ""Government Approved News"", but the movie balances this by letting us see protest demonstrations.

Here are some highlights:

(SORT OF SPOILER ALERT)
(but this really doesn't give away the overall plot)

The government, in order to pay off the deficit, got off any ""money standard"" and made possession of gold so illegal that people can get rewards for turning in friends or family who possess even small amounts of gold.

In one scene, a girl is shown scanning $100 banknotes into her bank account via smartphone app, then being instructed to burn the note. (She was in class at school at the time, and had a stack of notes waiting to be scanned that was two inches thick.)

In another scene, two people are showing training for how to react during a classroom shooting incident. (Both teachers had guns and were being trained on how to kill shooters without killing too many children.)

In another scene, we see ""NOT OUR DEBT"" protest rallies, where protesters refuse to pay the government's debt.",1526688000,2,3026,4.900195694716243
8723591,4,B0113NVV1Y,I liked the fact that a movie can be made with out excessive swearing. This is a PG -13 type movie and for mature audiences.  Pretty bold statements of characters taking a stand for conservative values.  The Constitution is upheld and observed closely in the end.,1523664000,2,263,4.695652173913044
8723592,3,B0113NVV1Y,"I had to really think about what rating this movie deserved, on one hand it deserved 5 for having Kevin Sorbo but on the other hand it deserved no stars for being this movie.

This movie contained blatant propaganda for some form of hellscape libertarian wet-dream in which private citizens should buy their own nuclear weapons, be able to sell drugs to children, prostitute themselves (for the Lord or something), etc, it contained bad acting, bad cgi, bad everything, but hey it had Brandy Maxxx from Parks and Rec inexplicably playing a prostitute, soI guess God has a sense of humor.

The true highlight of this movie was when they went to the housing center for FEMA (yes you read that right, the primary villains of this movie is FEMA), which was named the Al Gore Institute of Hating Freedom... or something or other.

This movie is inexplicable and simply goes on too long, every scene goes on too long, you'll reach what feels like the natural conclusion and then realize there's fifty minutes left.

On the whole, give it a watch, it's free with prime, it's no good, don't think I'm saying that, but you will laugh while being horrified, and hey, at least Kevin Sorbo is entertaining.",1521417600,,1194,4.698564593301436
