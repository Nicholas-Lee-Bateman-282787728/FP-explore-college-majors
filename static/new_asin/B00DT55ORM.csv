5854363,5,B00DT55ORM,"As one of the founding members of the Catholic Whistleblowers who has fought in the trenches to expose the sexual abuse of minors by clergy, I was greatly impressed by the well-balanced, well-researched presentation exposing the horrors that were committed, not only by a sick priest, but by all those involved in covering up his crimes and enabling him to continue molesting.  Bravo -- and keep up the good work!  It is only when the spotlight of truth shines on the dirty dark secrets that we can ever get the house of God cleaned.",1397779200,16,533,4.659574468085107

These alarming crimes are not unique to the US and Canada ... it has been a global and mind-boggling scandal that goes back several centuries!

My opinion on subtitles for ANY film is if the producers don't have the funds to add subtitles don't make the film.  It disenfranchises an entire group of viewers.  For me, I like subtitles because I don't want to miss a word of dialogue.

Also, the revelation of what the power of religion and repression of natural impulses can lead to when juxtaposed against the power of natural drives is worth contemplating.  The documentary does not preach to the audience this underlying message.  A quiet pace is used to render this unfortunate portrait of a bad moment within a religious structure.",1443139200,2,485,5.10126582278481

5854427,5,B00DT55ORM,"Speaking as a practicing Catholic I found this film so moving not to mention shocking. I've read many books on the abuse scandal and while most of them were very well written this takes everything to a new level.  Its focus on the people involved and giving them a voice makes it an even more powerful and moving event.  I can try to put to words how much this film moved me and how emotional it was.  I found my self moving from shock, to anger then to sympathy and on and on and still find that the words fail me when I try to describe how touched I was.  My admiration for these people to come forward and tell their stories is impossible to state.

This is a great movie and worth your time!",1432857600,6,695,4.118518518518519

5854442,5,B00DT55ORM,"This was fantastic! My father was born and raised in Tuscany, Italy. He grew up in a small village (La Pieve di Monti di Villa) up in the mountains above Lucca. He was sexually molested by the priest in his village (as were many children in this small village). He tried to tell his parents and they responded with ""Don't talk about the priest that way!"" My father is now 83 and still suffers from this abuse. He has PTSD with extreme anxiety and depression and he has nightmares every night. The abuse my father endured by the priest in his village robbed him of any confidence and a happy life. It subsequently robbed me and my siblings of a competent, effective, and fully present father.

I learned a lot about the Catholic Church that I was not fully aware of and this helped to strengthen our decision to leave the Catholic Church about six months ago. We can no longer attend the Catholic Church with what we now know. I cannot support a system that practices denial and deception and does not protect children. It is like one big really, really dysfunctional, extremely sick family.",1428364800,7,1090,4.561224489795919

5854454,5,B00DT55ORM,Mea Maxima Culpa is a documentary about Roman Catholic priests who molest children. The doc covers all the world but concentrates on deaf children at a deaf school. They are perfect victims as most of the parents were not signing parents so they didn't understand when the kids tried to tell them. The story even goes into Vatican secrets. Very good film.,1406678400,6,355,4.741935483870968
5854455,5,B00DT55ORM,"Well researched documentary that covers the history of clerical sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, not only in the US but around the world.  The Church apparently has had this problem for literally centuries, and has chosen to protect priests rather than their victims.  It becomes very obvious as to why Benedict XVI (Cardinal Ratzinger) resigned from the Papacy after watching this film, leaving the Church with an unprecedented historical situation of having two authorized Popes living at the same time.  Pope Frances has his hands full with a shameful mess that has been tolerated for much too long and has already started to reach out and apologize to sexual abuse victims. I would recommend this to anyone interested in this topic.",1404777600,,740,5.049180327868853
5854456,5,B00DT55ORM,"An interesting and shocking documentary focusing on the molestation of boys at a school for the deaf in Milwaukee by Roman Catholic priests.  However, the film goes beyond this case and in a very interesting section of the film goes on to discuss the political situation in the Vatican under John Paul II and his successor Benedict which contributed to the covering up of abuse situations like the one at the school.  In particular, the association and friendship of John Paul II with Maciel Degolado, the founder of the Legion of Christ and a serial sexual predator and drug addict is reviewed.  Maciel's contribution of large cash donations from the wealthy religious order that he founded encouraged John Paul II to ignore the rumors surrounding Maciel. His successor, Benedict, was forced to confront the scandal only because Maciel's crimes finally claimed the attention of press investigations in both the U.S. and Europe.  The documentary includes interviews with priests who describe how they reported molestation cases to the Church hierarchy only to find that the hierarchy was more interested in hiding these cases rather than actively intervening to stop the outrages that were occurring.  Watching this documentary makes one wonder why John Paul II was declared a saint!  He himself was not a molester but he apparently actively conspired to hide and/or ignore the many molestation cases that were occurring.  Again, his association with Degolado is particularly damning.  All in all, a very informative and shocking documentary well worth seeing.",1404518400,19,1560,5.236947791164659

8597465,5,B00DT55ORM,"Religion is what has caused most of the suffering in the world since the beginning of recorded history. The Catholic church is responsible for the the majority of that suffering. From what I have seen and read in the past 50 years, the Catholic church appears to be an enormous sex club for pedophile priests, which is protected all the way from the top by the Pope.

I feel pity for people who are duped by this cult and the ones who become victim of its abuses. Beginning way back with the Spanish Inquisitions, through the murder of hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoples by Catholic conquistadors in the Americas, to the Catholic church's allegiance with Fascist Mussolini and the Nazi's during WWII...and throughout time with the brutal abuse of power that was exercised in the name of God and Jesus to rape and sodomize little children...while all the while making themselves fabulously wealthy at the expense of their impoverished follower's money, they have a lot to answer for. It surprises me that anyone can trust this church any more. Where was God and Jesus while all these enormous crimes took place? Maybe all religion has passed its expiration date on earth.

8597470,5,B00DT55ORM,"This harrowing documentary takes us into the dark heart of the Catholic church and its centuries-old custom of brainwashing and sexually assaulting the innocent children in its care. Within the Church, priests are glorified as agents of God on Earth, hence, infallible and untouchable.  How convenient. The heroes of this film are the men who were abused as boys while residents of a Catholic home and school for the deaf, who, after many years of remembering and suffering in silence, banded together to sue the Vatican and demand accountability and justice. By the time Father Murphy was put out to pasture he had abused at least 200 children, but he was never convicted of his crimes and never saw jail time. It seems that back in the day, vulnerable deaf children made great targets for pedophile priests. And what do you know? The same targeting of deaf children was occurring in Italy.  Who knows how many other places?

When Gibney shows the movies made by the school for the deaf from 50 years ago, and you see just how young and innocent these little children are, you will have a hard time containing your rage and revulsion. Child-raping priests belong in prison for life; instead, they are  guarded, protected, moved around, given a little therapy here and there, and never held accountable or punished in any way. It's enough to make you physically ill.  Almost as an aside, we learn that at one point some Church officials attempted to buy an island in the Caribbean as an alternative to prison, a Church-run haven where pedophile priests could live in order to be shielded from children, whom they are obviously incapable of not molesting. The higher-ups nixed this elegant plan. How would it look if the faithful knew that pedophiles were living out their days on the Church's dime lounging on a tropical beach drinking pina coladas? If you watch this documentary, you will learn about this and many other appalling events and actions taken by the Church that will set your hair on fire.

As an institution, the Catholic church has been very skillful at amassing wealth at the expense of its parishioners and constructing walls of silence and mystification around itself. This film demonstrates just how much, and for how long, the Church knew of the pedophilia among priests, and yes, it goes all the way to the top, to the Pope himself (take your pick which one). Church records dating back to the fourth century refer to the problem of pedophilia in the Church. The latest tactic of the Church to avoid paying large damage awards to victims is to move the money to shell companies or trusts and then declare bankruptcy.

Anyone who saw ""Spotlight,"" which won the Oscar a couple of years ago, has some understanding of the issue, but ""Mea Maxima Culpa,"" by focusing on the experiences of several fiercely determined deaf men, makes the story personal, powerful and heartbreaking. Those who go after children are the lowest form of life, and the Church seems to offer these monsters a safe, comfortable environment in which to lurk and devastate lives.

This film predates the arrival of Pope Francis. I hope Gibney makes a follow-up to show us what, if anything, improves under his watch.",1494115200,,3206,4.82695810564663
8597471,5,B00DT55ORM,"This documentary will outrage you, sicken you and move you to tears. For decades the Catholic church not only sheltered but enabled priests that it knew were pedophiles, moving them from parish to parish and giving them access to hundreds of victims.  Corruption and complicity go to the very highest level - the pope himself.  Victims bravely share their anguish here in hopes of informing others of the danger and preventing damage to others.

Martin Luther left the church because of fiscal and moral corruption - and nothing has changed in the centuries since.  The church is supposed to be the place that shelters and nurtures the flock of faithful, not prey upon them. This film is a cry for justice.",1490659200,3,706,4.809917355371901
