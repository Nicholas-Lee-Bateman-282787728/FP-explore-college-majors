7167261,3,B00XDBMB4Q,"It is really upsetting that the run time for this new series is only about 5 hours! Back in series 13 the total run time was over 10 hours with four dvds! That is cutting the amount of episodes we get in half, yet charging the same amount of money. I will not be buying series 17 because of this.",1442016000,3,296,3.95
7167262,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"The Brits are very good at changing their casts around in their series tv. It is a tricky thing to do and mostly series close when cast members are substituted. This show is one of the successes in series cast changes. There have been only two Barnabys and this second one has been quite good. I've lost track of the assistants there have been so many. This new assistant is perhaps the most attractive of the bunch although we've had some funnier ones. This Barnaby also has a darling Jack Russell dog which I've appreciated too.

There are four episodes and, as usual, they all revolve around grisly murder(s) in the most bucolic and lovely English villages. It is the contrast which makes this show. There is the prim and proper villager going about his or her duty with a stiff upper lip--and one of those folks is murdering someone with outright abandon and glee. Our detectives have to catch this wolf hiding out in a Burberry. Here are some quickie summaries of the episodes:

A murder by a toy roulette wheel sent to an illustrator's home. She operates it and is killed. Her writer partner was the late George Summersbee, writer of the Jed Dagger novels. Fittingly enough, a village crime fiction festival is going on run by the crime writer's sister-in-law. So we have murders going on while a crime fiction festival is going on. It is very tongue in cheek and thus hilarious.

A Pub landlady is crushed to death whilst assisting a magician. The magician has been linked to Satanism by the village's curate, who is also murdered on a pagan altar where seemingly midnight rituals occur by robed Satanists. This show never has a supernatural element so the answer has to be yet another traditionally clad Brit living the life of an English villager.

Another episode involves a folk festival in a village. What has enraged villagers is that the festival organizer is planning to move it. This will also remove the money it brings into the village. So, of course, this organizer is found dead, his head held down in a bowl of water containing eels and eggs, something only the Brits would consider eating.

Finally, there is a winery in a Midsomer village winery. It holds a launch for its new wine while a ruthless wine critic is present, Nadia. Several guests at the party end up poisoned by the wine but not fatally. Turns out the wine critic is the suspect in chief for the hit and run killing of a little girl by a presumably drunk driver. Certain people have not forgotten that she was never tried for the killing.

These are all immensely enjoyable, just like their predecessor episodes were.",1441670400,,2605,4.6521739130434785
7167263,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"Remains the loveliest settings for any murder series ever. Always multiple murder. Gorgeous architecture and gardens. Of course one key to the huge success of Midsomer Murders is the high level of writing and acting. Other contemporary Brit cop series seldom match Midsomer's excellence. They often try via shock scenes, violence, or unnatural action. If you like suspense and intrigue depth, similar to Agatha Christie, then Midsomer Murder continues to deliver. After 4 seasons of 4 episodes each, the next season will have six as a result of increasing world-wide Midsomer popularity.

Neil Dudgeon leads for his 5th season, picking up DS Nelson (Gwilym Lee -`Land Girls') for 3 seasons. Fiona Dolman as wife Sarah began in 2011 alongside Tamzin Malleson who ends her 19 episodes/5 season role as Kate Wilding with series 17. No regular cast remains from Midsomer Murders' beginning, but story, new cast, and guests have kept it a top crime hit on both sides of the Atlantic.

SDH SUBTITLES for episodes plus all 3 bonus segments. Episode also contain sub-plots involving the primary characters' lives.
<[]> The Dagger Club ==A book illustrator murder by a roulette wheel ginds Nelson linking the murder to the 1st Dagger Mystery book plot. Who stole the latest manuscript? A good book publishing who-dun-it that includes guest stars Georgia Taylor (`Casualty') and Una Stubbs (`Sherlock').
<[]> Murder by Magic ==A pub owner and parish pianist crushed by a giant box from a church charity magic show, but was she the intended victim? Church folk and Satanists both become suspect. Watch for Deborah Findlay (`Cranford' `Wives & Daughters'), the magician as Andrew Lee Potts (`The Mill' a must see), the victim's husband played by Joe Absolom (`Doc Martin'), the vicar by Jack Shepherd, and the magician's mom by Amanda Burton (`Silent Witness' `The Commander').
<[]> The Ballad of Midsomer County ==A bowl of water, eggs, & eels and eggs kills Folk Fest organizer. The manner of death mimes the local classic folk ballad, thus it's sure to be murder. Episode includes several fun snippets of folk music. Outstanding episode plus again loaded with guest stars. Hotel owners by Dean Andrews (`Last Tango in Halifax' `Life on Mars') & Claudie Blakley (`Lark Rise to Candleford' `Cranford'); Clarke Peters (Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime); Sean Gilder (`Horatio Hornblower'); & Rosalind March (`Calendar Girls').
<[]> A Vintage Murder ==Midsomer Vinae winery wine-tasting glasses come with poison, hit-and-run, sabotage, and abduction offers no ""Cheers"" toasts over new vintage murders.  Selina Griffiths (`Cranford') plays Elspeth. Claire Bloom (`Doc martin' `King's Speech') also picks up a guest star role. So many red herrings I couldn't guess who-dun-it.

Midsomer Murder started in 1997, and episodes 105 to 110 are finished or being prepared for 2016 TV airing. May Midsomer never run out of citizens to murder.",1441411200,8,2923,5.252676659528908
7167264,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"In 2014 Acorn Home Video started re-numbering all of their series based on the original British sequencing & series breakdown. In the 'set' numbering system (which often split each series into two sets), this would be set #26. I am actually surprised set 25 was issued under that number as Acorn had already switched to the series numbers and set 25 was the entire series 16.

To add more confusion, Acorn created special cheaper 3-disc sets for the big-box stores such as Costco. These have their own set numbers which can look like the regular disc sets, but have different episodes inside.

Now as for the episodes, I think the new cast has found their rhythm here.  The series as a whole lost some of it's charm several years ago, but the new cast is adding new life and forming their own new relationships.

The series (seasons) are getting shorter each year, what was once an 8 episode series under John Nettles has now been reduced down to 4.

#101 - ""THE DAGGER CLUB"" (01/28/15) A manuscript is stolen for a newly-discovered novel by deceased Midsomer crime-writer George Summersbee.
#102 - ""MURDER BY MAGIC"" (02/04/15) Pub landlady Hannah Altman is crushed to death when a stunt goes wrong during a magic show;
#103 - ""THE BALLAD OF MIDSOMER COUNTY"" (02/11/15) The murder of a Folk Festival organizer seems to be inspired by a famous ballad.
#104 - ""A VINTAGE MURDER"" (02/18/15) Guests sampling the latest sparkling wine by Midsomer Vinae Winery start to collapse.

We can look forward to series 18 as ITV has ordered next years shows and they are going into production as you read this.",1437782400,167,1596,4.723021582733813
7167265,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"I have seen all 4 episodes on line and loved them like I have loved the previous 16 seasons. The best casting, the best locations, and the best corpses. It may be released as Series 17, as labeled, or as set 26. Season 16 was released as set 25. ITV renewed Midsomer Murders for an 18 season and it is filming now. It should air beginning in January. There is no show like this one. It you love Poirot, Miss Marple, Miss Fisher, or Sherlock Holmes you will love this show. I would recommend buying season 17 just as much as would recommend  the previous 16 seasons. There is no show better. A must buy.",1436745600,45,602,4.234782608695652
7167266,3,B00XDBMB4Q,"I've been watching these on Acorn -- have seen 3 of 4 so far. The acting is still superb. Dudgeon is great as the new Inspector Barnaby and the rest of the ensemble are also excellent. The settings, as usual, are gorgeous. But something is missing. The plots seem artificial. Characters change without sufficient motivation. It's as if everyone's going through the motions, but without much feeling. I note that Brian True-May is gone, so perhaps that's what's missing. Don't get me wrong, these are still fun to watch, but this is (so far) one of the weakest seasons of Midsomer ever -- and I've watched and rewatched all of them. I also wonder whether they're planning to get Gwilym Lee his own show, or somehow transition him to Inspector here.

The feel I have is of a great franchise that is running on its previous glory, with all the parts but weak execution. I really hope it's a temporary aberration -- I've loved Midsomer.

Update -- Just watched the 4th show. It's a little better, perhaps as good as a fair show of the Tom Barnaby era. Three and a half stars.",1434240000,84,1071,4.544041450777202

This series still has a certain amount of humor, but it seems that the new production team is determined to add a Waking the Dead-style edginess that is somewhat foreign to the Midsomer Murders tradition.  I hope that they don't go more in this direction, or this may become a case of a program that is not sure what it is.  A lot of us Midsomer Murders fans might miss John Nettles, but Neil Dudgeon is a great successor to the original Chief Inspector Barnaby.

7167455,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"MIDSOMER MURDERS has been around so long they can now change the box information from ""Set 20-something"" to ""Series 17"". Apart from this bit of confusion fans of the series will rejoice in the return of DCI John Barnaby and his sidekick, DS Charlie Nelson. Four more murder mysteries need solved and the duo are more than up to the task. Of course we know all this. What, then, inspires us to return for more?

The fictional county of Midsomer (Murder Capitol of the U.K.) is endlessly beautiful and sinister. The people who people it are eccentric, peculiar and, in many cases, dangerous. And Barnaby and Nelson are like a couple of old friends we look up to and admire as they solve case after case together.

And let 's not forget Barnaby's home life, with his wife, new child and Sykes the dog! Sykes brings a smile to my face every time I see him. Sure, the baby's cute, too.

It seems MIDSOMER MURDERS could run ever. It won't, so keep enjoying it while you can. And have a cup of tea while you're at it.",1451606400,,1010,4.390374331550802

In two episodes, back to back, the story line and mixed racial composition of leading parts are essentially the same. The first involves a missing/hidden manuscript, the second, a missing/hidden album of music.

Jones, is a great addition to the cast.  Gwilym Lee is cast as DS Charlie Nelson and he fits in nicely and hits it off from the beginning with Barnaby as Jones in the past, seemed to bristle now and then with Barnaby.  The episodes are very intriguing and holds your interest, especially the Murder by Magic episode, which, if you are a magic fan, you will enjoy very much along with the plot of the magician and his mother and wife.  It will keep you guessing.  Also the featurettes about the actors and the magic tricks and the behind the scenes adds to the enjoyment of this disc.  The blu-ray is beautiful.

The new Barnaby's character annoys the hell out of me.  I don't know why the writers would reduce Jones to a blithering idiot so the new chief could seem more intelligent.  No wonder he left Midsomer!  Slippery slope, people.

Neil Dudgeon plays smug.  Not a wise choice.  Stupid, really.  It is impossible to know if the actor is influencing theses choices or the writers are arrested in their development.  The ""I'm so smart because you are incredibly inept"" school of thinking is insulting.

What I loved about Midsomer Murders was the wonderful manner in which some highly ridiculous situations were handled with great humor and how many jewels of this humor were to be discovered when rewatching episodes.  Over the years with Tom Barnaby, his influence over his staff was woven into episodes with subtly.

The new Barnaby is a pretentious and even obnoxious egotist.

My disappointment is not a gleeful thing.  I loved Midsomer and can only say that I would watch forever if only the writing of the characters is not reduced to a most common of denominators.

At the moment I am feeling that the show is living up to what one of my dear friends said about someone he'd just met.  ""She's simply not pretty enough to be acting that way."".",1443830400,8,1406,4.669387755102041

7167536,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"MIDSOMER MURDERS, SERIES 17. The English cozya village mystery-- gets a contemporary spin in this hit British television series of crime dramas that have earned a substantial worldwide following. Mind you, other reviewers have mentioned that the numbering of this particular series, at 17, may be a bit confusing in that these four feature length police procedurals were actually broadcast after the recently released series 25.  This is all a bit beyond me, but never mind, in this popular British mystery entertainment, which debuted in the United Kingdom in March, 1997,  and has run for more than the magic 100 feature-length episodes, we continue to find  the idyllic villages and bucolic settings of Englands most murderous countythe fictional Midsomer-- harboring macabre crimes and eccentric characters. The box set, which I received as a review copy, includes two DVDs, of approximately 356 minutes. Bonus features include featurettes about the actors (nine minutes); the magic tricks in MURDER BY MAGIC (eight minutes) and behind the scenes (ten minutes). And it has subtitles, thank goodness, though the sound is generally clear and comprehensible.

Of course, in this light-hearted but flavorful and well-acted production, set in gorgeous surrounds, the villains, no matter how villainous,  are no match for DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon, LIFE OF RILEY) and his assistant, DS Charlie Nelson (Gwilym Lee, LAND GIRLS).  Guest stars include Amanda Burton, (SILENT WITNESS); Claire Bloom (THE KINGS SPEECH); Joe Absolom, (DOC MARTIN); Andrew Lee Potts, (PRIMEVAL); Claudie Blakley, (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, THE DRIVER) and Clarke Peters,(THE WIRE, AGATHA CHRISTIES PARTNERS IN CRIME). Also, Deborah Findlay (JANE EYRE, VANITY FAIR); Una Stubbs, (SHERLOCK) and Georgia Taylor (LAW & ORDER: UK).  The mysteries are:

1.  The Dagger ClubThe manuscript of a posthumous novel by a bestselling writer is discovered. The manuscript goes missing; a villager, who was the authors cover illustrator, turns up dead.
2.  Murder by MagicA magic trick gone wrong, killing a pub landlady, exposes tensions between members of St. Cyprians Church and a local pagan group.
3.  The Ballad of Midsomer CountyThe Little Crosby Folk Festival is transformed into a crime scene after the organizer is found drowned in a bowl of eels and eggs. Barnaby and Nelson discover that his death seems to be inspired by a classic song, The Ballad of Midsomer County.
4.  A Vintage MurderBarnaby investigates a local winery after the house vintage, in a public tasting, is found to be poisoned. The detective discovers that the sabotage, which first appears to be the latest attempt to discredit the vineyard, may be related to the death of a child in a hit-and-run accident nearby.

In this perennially popular TV production, the photography continues to be excellent, as is the dialog, and the mysteries themselves. Further, I am happy to say that while the entertainment continues to be enjoyable, family-friendly --  violence-, sex- and profanity-free-- its plots are getting deeper and more complex, with more, and more interesting, characters and motivations.  No matter the numbers, the series is getting better with time.",1442275200,,3200,5.346613545816733
7167537,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"When the writing matches the eeriness of the series' haunting theme music, Midsomer Murders is at its best. I love how this series, that is basically a police procedural, usually has an off-kilter feel to the murders. That and the humor make it great viewing, and I'm still a great fan in spite of the cast changes.

Series 17 may have only 4 episodes,  but they are 93 minutes each without commercials. That allows for great character development and convoluted plotting.

If you watched the previous season, Series 16 (also released in Region 1 as Set 25), you know that DCI John Barnaby and his wife, Sarah, were expecting their first child:

At the start of this Series 17, we get to meet their new baby, little Betty, who has her Daddy wrapped around her little finger. Good thing Barnaby has Sykes to talk to.

Series 17 has 372 minutes of lovely mysteries. The DVD/BluRay sets present them in 16:9 widescreen and stereo sound. English subtitles are available on both the episodes and on the Bonus Features.

Speaking of Bonus Features, there's 3 of them, and I give you a bit of information on them after the episode descriptions.

Episode 1 ""The Dagger Club""
Suzie Colebrooke, returns home to find the house ransacked and her husband, Niall gone. While she's on the phone with the police, the post delivers a big box. She opens it to find a roulette wheel. Death by roulette wheel! Only in Midsomer!
By the way, do you like to keep track of the Midsomer County village names used in the series? In ""The Dagger Club"" we get Midsomer Mere and Luxton Deeping. Love it!
Favorite quote: ""I get a lovely view from the moral high ground.""

Episode 2 ""Murder by Magic""
St. Cyprian's, parish church of Midsomer Oaks, is holding a fundraiser. It's a show by the well-known magician Gideon Latimer, who, just a couple months ago, bought Melmoth Manor on the village outskirts. Most people are enjoying themselves, but the curate stands up in the middle of the show growling, ""This is an outrage!"" He and like-minded parishioners make a statement with their walk-out. That won't be why the show will be remembered, though. Not after a magician's cage suspended in the air crashes down on the organist, and kills her. A tragic accident? Not in Midsomer.
This episode has a great take on how myths are born. Production is a little sloppy, showing a constable searching the first victim's house without gloves. But then, as I remind myself, this IS Midsomer.
Trivia: If you've been to/read about the Roman Bath at Bath, England [worth a trip], you'll know that it was dedicated to the goddess Sulis.
Episode 2 Bonus Extras:
A. ""Murder by Magic - The Actors"" (9 minutes) Commentators include Charlie Palmer (director), Jack Shepherd (plays Magnus Sloane), Gwilym Lee (plays DS Charlie Nelson), Neil Dudgeon (plays DCI John Barnaby), Amanda Burton (plays Carole Latimer) and Stephanie Leonides (plays Annabel Latimer).  Dudgeon jokes: ""As I get older, there are fewer OLDER artistes for me to pick the brains of. So when somebody as marvelous and worthy of respect as Jack Shepherd comes to be in the show, it is a great opportunity to quiz him.""
B. ""Murder by Magic - The Tricks"" (8 minutes) Commentators include Neil Dudgeon, Charlie Palmer, Jack Shepherd, Gwilym Lee. Jack Shepherd says, ""to make the tricks work [for filming], we had to become our own reflection."" I had to watch the episode a second time to catch what he was talking about.

Episode 3 ""The Ballad of Midsomer County""
Toby Winning, music promoter, is looking forward to the 1st day of the Lower Crosby Folk Festival, the 10th year that he's produced it. Unfortunately, he'll never get to see it, because someone makes sure he drowns in a bowl of live eels and boiled eggs. The perfect Midsomer weirdness murder. The eels and eggs are taken from the hit folk song of a local singer who committed suicide 20 years ago. The past and present collide, and Winning is only the 1st victim.
Episode 3 Bonus Extra ""Behind the Scenes of Ballad of Midsomer County"" (10 minutes) Commentators include Gwylim Lee, Neil Dudgeon, Renny Rye (director), Clarke Peters (plays Frank Wainright, and sings) and Rakie Ayola (plays Alice Winning, and sings). Dudgeon jokes, ""Somebody asked me personally whether I had any musical ability... that could be included in the episode."" The answer was negative.

Episode 4 ""Vintage Murder""
Carnarvan estate, outside the village of Midsomer Vinae, is holding a big do to launch its new sparkling wine. They've brought in a well-known wine critic, Nadia Simons, as guest of honor. It's a shocker when Simons announces, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I have tasted some great English wines in my time. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.... I suppose I'd drink it at a wedding, but I certainly wouldn't insult the bride by toasting her with it.""
Her loutish manner seems contrived, but that's not the half of it. Directly after, half the attendees start dropping to the ground, poisoned by something in their wine. William Carnarvon thinks it's the FWA (Farmers' Wives Association) trying to ruin him. But it can't be that simple in Midsomer.
This lovely episode plays fair with the viewer, and gives you a clue the murderer early on.

Trivia: This is the last Series for Dr. Kate Wilding as Causton's police pathologist. Series 18, which will air in 2016, will have a new female pathologist, played by Manjinder Virk.

Once again, I am not disappointed by Midsomer Murders. Recommended viewing!

8715760,5,B00XDBMB4Q,"At this point in my Midsomer Murders viewing I expect to love most, if not, all of the episodes. I think part of the success of this series is how close to the original series format it has remained. The transition from Tom Barnaby to John Barnaby was seamless(I was not happy about the change in character, but it turned out great). When you love something, you don't want it to change(much).

1. The Dagger Club
2. Murder by Magic
3. The Ballad of Midsomer
4. A Vintage Murder
372 minutes of Midsomer......Charlie Nelson is the DS in these episodes, if you are a longtime viewer, there is nothing not to like. Although these are good, I am currently watching Series 18, and I would rate it slightly better, and a must have !  Although the murders provide a central focus and plot....the best aspect of Midsomer Murders are the villages, the countryside, the awesome forest scenes and photography. It's almost like taking a vacation to the best of the English midlands. Prepare a pot of tea, some biscuits or scones with clotted cream and lemon curd and settle in on a cold weekend...:)  or not.",1514419200,,958,4.8
