2463597,3,B000CFLWKK,"This is an oddball horror anthology film. The main stories are clearly set in Britain, starring British actors. Yet the wraparound tale is obviously set in New York City. ""Obviously,"" in that NYC  landmarks are evident. This is not Toronto trying to look like NYC.

Film opens with two stereotypical New York guys -- leather jackets and heavy Nue Yawk accents -- who steal some horror movies from a Manhattan video store, escaping down the subway. They go to their friend's apartment to watch the films

Their friend is a young, sexy woman. Which means that when she hears her doorbell, we are treated to some gratuitous topless shots as she emerges from the shower. (The actress -- Marie Scinto -- is very nice looking indeed.)

Marie (also the character's name) tells her guy friends that she is preparing for a date, but she relents to watching a couple of horror movies with them first. So the guys pop a horror movie into Marie's VCR, and thus follow the three British tales of terror.

(And in case we don't know it, one of the guys says after one of the tales, ""These are British films. I can tell by the way the actors tawk."")

* FIRST story is about an elderly puppeteer (with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Cushing/dp/0956653480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Cushing</a>&nbsp;quality) who does&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punch-and-Judy/dp/0486449033/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punch and Judy</a>&nbsp;shows in an English seacoast resort town. (The setting resembles the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quadrophenia/dp/B0083V2W6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quadrophenia</a>). His wife and stepson hate the man's obsession with puppets. The stepson tries setting them on fire. The puppets apparently don't care for this and take vengeance. Naturally, there's a surprise twist ending.

* In the SECOND story a young couple move into a new house. The wife sees people who aren't there, blood stains, and all manner of hauntings. Her husband thinks she may be going mad. Another surprise ending -- a good one -- which follows after you'd thought the story was over.

* The THIRD story concerns a youth who lands a job as a gardener/handyman for two old women. The women talk about ghosts and fairies and gnomes -- their garden is FULL of garden gnomes -- who supposedly haunt the place. The youth sees that the women have much cash hidden at home. He returns with two fellow hoods to rob his employers. The concept of the gnomes in this tale resembles the puppets in the first story. Still, this was an entertaining tale, albeit a bit goofy.

After these tales -- and some more gratuitous nudity from Marie -- there is a final shocker at Marie's New York apartment.

I wondered if the producers had bought the rights to three British short films, then filmed a separate wraparound in New York. But the same puppet from the first tale -- or one very much like it -- shows up in the New York wraparound story.

SCREAMTIME is a fun film. Nice looking actresses, good spooky atmosphere, some typical horror film idiots (the girl in the first tale can clearly OUTRUN her pursuer, yet she keeps STOPPING and trying to hide) and some over-the-top goofy/gory horror.",1377907200,15,3316,5.345489443378119

2463600,3,B000CFLWKK,Not my type of film but I am sure someone will watch this film and love it. Just not me.,1402876800,,88,3.45
2463601,2,B000CFLWKK,Definitely dated.  A bit campy but fair.  My 17 year old daughter thought it was funny....  Worth a laugh and the stories have a twilight zonesque feel to them,1401148800,,159,4.413793103448276
2463602,4,B000CFLWKK,"I think you have to go into this film with the right frame of mind. It's vintage campy horror, so it's not particularly scary as much as like going through an old fashioned fun house. I enjoyed the stories, even though they are mostly retreads and the characterizations of the women are dated. It was interesting to see a vintage take on the found footage format. For scares, watch something else. But for amusement, I think this one is worth the time.",1400803200,,452,4.524390243902439
2463603,3,B000CFLWKK,The movie is to old fashioned for me. This is so called horror that we were scared of back in the 60's and 70s. I wouldn't recommend that you waste your time unless this is what you like.,1400716800,,187,3.9473684210526314
2463604,1,B000CFLWKK,"I really can't say much about this movie.  Screamtime?...how did they come up with the title is beyond me as I sure didn't scream...well, maybe jumped once.  Odd endings, rushed endings...and more make this a late night, ""yawn"", nice sleeping pill type movie.  I could never recommend viewing if one had to pay for it...but since it was offered by Amazon for free, I gave it a try.  Heck, I may just be the type to watch anything once...

So, if you just want to get a few giggles and realize how great top movies are, get this one!  I think it will make you appreciate top movies that much more!",1398211200,,596,4.324324324324325
2463605,3,B000CFLWKK,"I have to echo Thomas. (Read his review.) The first story is lame and predictable and, yes, there's the obligatory bad guy chases young woman scene...and, of course, he catches her. Yeesh!

The second story has a great ending. It's almost a spoiler to say you're not going where you think you're going. This one alone is worth the price of rental and worth watching again even when you know the ending. Wonderful!

The third piece is the lamest. Bad acting, over the tope ending. Suffice it to say the old ladies have an army to protect them. These guys never had a chance.

And there's the added  bonus of some gratuitous nudity. So what's not to like? 3 stars.",1398124800,3,662,4.491666666666666

2463607,3,B000CFLWKK,"Good trilogy. My favorite was the second story. At the end it literally made me say, Oh my God"" out loud. Lol. All the endings are full of surprises. It's like a twilight zone kind of movie.",1385942400,10,190,4.162162162162162
8098779,4,B000CFLWKK,"I use a bare-bones cable service and saw this on the scary-movie channel.
Imagine it: a middle-aged couple sleep in separate bedrooms. Each hears a whispering voice call their names. You already know what happens to them. I was scared to death.
As I switched out the lights to go to bed, I kept thinking ""It's only a movie. It happened a long time ago--in the UK! Not here. It's only a movie."" I listened for the whisperer for half the night. I suspect that the people who do not like the movie cannot handle the level of fear it delivers and switched it off.
It helps if you have English ancestry--the incumbent neurosis about quiet, ancient homes and sugary old ladies. The sugary clairvoyant tells the freaked-out younger woman, ""Some of my best friends are ghosts."" The film also contains mischievous twists that are too dishy to give away.",1494979200,,844,4.633333333333334

8098784,1,B000CFLWKK,"Dreadful. I love ""bad"" horror movies, but this is a waste of time. The production is akin to a 70s Doctor Who without the charm, wit, or originality. Don't bother.",1439596800,,163,4.466666666666667
