7705686,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Having already succeeded with 2014's surprise hit Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Russos returned a 3rd time to helm Steve Rogers's latest adventure. So the question is, does Captain America:Civil War start Phase 3 on the right track?

Chris Evans has never looked better as the titular hero than he does here in Captain America:Civil War. From the time he was a skinny boy in 2011's The First Avenger, all the way until now, his acts of heroism come not solely based on his super-strength, but because he has a genuine good heart and believes in doing the right thing. I also am glad that Sebastian Stan's character Bucky Barnes was explored even further; and I can't help but to mention how well Robert Downey Jr.'s inclusion of Tony Stark works for this movie. While we may not see Iron Man 4 any time soon, I can guarantee you that he is just as entertaining to watch here as he has been since his character dawned in 2008's Iron Man. I also rather enjoyed the inclusion of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man in Captain America:Civil War. But its Chadwick Boseman  who makes for such an excellent addition to the Marvel Cinematic world as T'Challa; that patience is most definitely the only thing that will help me during the wait for his solo film come 2018 .

 And there are some emotional moments in the movie as well, but I literally cried tears of joy seeing Spider-Man being played so well by Tom Holland. Spider-Man's inclusion in the Marvel cinematic world was met with divisive opinions among fans(including myself), but its clear Tom Holland is the right choice for the web-slinger, and I can't wait to see his film come next year.

While the Civil War arc is a 7 issue story, Captain America:Civil War paces extremely well throughout its runtime. As expected, the fight scenes are memorably superb, and while I am more a fan of Steve Rogers's ideals and principles, you really do understand both Tony and Steve's perspectives of why they feel the way they do. Its rare that a movie can handle so many characters and have a cohesive story, but Captain America: Civil War does just that. The Russos have not only succeeded with The Winter Soldier, they have added a worthy sequel to an already engrossing trilogy.

So I'd definitely give a resounding YES, Captain America: Civil War not only starts Phase 3 on the right track, but it also signifies of bigger things to come in the Marvel world in the future. Captain America: Civil War is an absolute smash, and I can definitely assure you, that this IS why we go to the movies.",1462579200,3,2535,4.622222222222222
7705687,5,B01D9EUNBY,"If your best friend was your enemy, would you fight for his freedom? That is the question as the Captain returns alongside his right hand pal/enemy, The Winter Soldier, to combat the forces of justice. In their effort to prove ""temporary insanity"" of Bucky Barnes (W.S.) during his moments when the hitman inside of him takes over and his mind blanks out, Captain America Steve Rogers goes against logic to fend for his historic friend. Tony Stark, Iron Man and Black Panther, unite with Spider-Man and the team to combat them. The action is fast and intense, and beautifully captured so there is little mistake as to what is happening on screen, thanks to the Russo Team's great sense of cinematography and storyboarding, resulting in some of the best action scenes in big spectacle blockbusters today. A satisfying story, intriguing character conflicts and lots of spectacular action unite in Civil War.
The 3D is equally effective, and while much of the film is at the average mid level of 3D volume and depth, the airport battle sequence boosts into high octane, full powered 3D with even a couple pop outs. The reliably steady 3D here is very much worth a look for 3D fans.",1462579200,34,1178,4.779411764705882
7705688,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Just saw the movie, walked out of the theater and pre-ordered the Bluray 3d edition.  Movie was even better than I expected.  If you were a fan of the Winter Soldier, you will love this movie.",1462579200,2,192,4.305555555555555
7705689,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Thing is, in real life, we'd all be on Iron Man's side on this. In real life, we wouldn't want vigilantes with crazy powers - some of whom can wipe out a city in a day - running around without some sort of oversight. Robert Downey, Jr. acts the sh-- out of this movie, plays up Stark as the embodiment of guilt, despair, and raging ego. But I feel folks are still sleeping on Chris Evans. CIVIL WAR relies on our buying into Cap's contention that the Avengers should have agency to operate on their own, never mind that 117 nations vehemently beg to differ and that Stark offers a potent argument for being put in check. Cap's conviction is deeply rooted in his disenchantment with S.H.I.E.L.D. and in his innate philosophy on freedom and the right to make your own choices. He's not budging. If Evans had fumbled even for a moment, the movie would've promptly collapsed. Because Stark has logic on his side. Except, in the course of what? thirteen movies now?, Cap has become the heart of the MCU, the moral compass of it. And that's a nod to Evans' knack to compel you and sway you and convince you. Chris Evans also acts the sh-- out of this movie.

If you're walking into this movie thinking ""Oh, no, these heroes ain't going hard at each other; they probably just gonna trade yo mama jokes"" - belay that thinking. CIVIL WAR enters that rarified air what's breathed in only by the likes of THE DARK KNIGHT, THE AVENGERS, and WINTER SOLDIER. The Russo bros are the truth, man. And I don't want to sell writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely short. They and the Russos, more than anyone else right now, are the integral threads that bind the MCU tapestry. What they've wrought here is a striking landscape of contrasting stances on themes such as personal accountability, collateral damage, and that oh-so-fine line that straddles autonomy and security. It's a remarkable morality play that takes time to present the characters' viewpoints in articulate ways. I love that there is real debate that goes on, and only when that falls thru - and the shadowy big bad starts finessing things - do the fists fly furiously. I appreciate that each character's motivation is laid out clearly, even the minor characters. When they pick a side, you get why. Someone I know complained that, by the movie's end, there's no resolution to the argument. Thing is, there's no right or wrong to it. Each side is right AND wrong. That's the beauty of it.

The creative team had a chore list of things to get done. They had to manage twelve superheroes, a villain, and an assortment of non-super supporting characters. They had to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU, and do that in style. They had to make sure Iron Man isn't the jerk he was in the comics. They had to do honor to the source material. They had to comb William Hurt's mustache. And they had to tell a stand-alone Captain America movie. Man, did they check all those boxes.

CIVIL WAR delivers payoff after payoff. It is wildly entertaining. It has crippling emotional weight. It explores in good depth the nature of real consequences. We see how various Avengers react when faced with the conscience-crushing burden of having perpetrated, however inadvertently, innumerable civilian casualties. Scarlet Witch is one who's particularly riddled with guilt. Gratifyingly, Wanda Maximoff is fleshed out even more, and we get an inkling of just how powerful she is. (Still, I wish her power set is better defined - I want to see her reality-warping hex powers explored more; as it is, she's just a really powerful telekinetic.) And will someone give Black Widow her solo movie already? Anyway, just about everyone gets a moment to shine. The only one I feel was sort of short-changed was War Machine. But maybe the Russos owe Terrence Howard some money.

The humor comes across organically. Spidey and Ant-Man steal so many scenes, which is to be expected. But who knew Falcon and Winter Soldier could be so droll together? And the action? Omigosh, the airport sequence - the hype is real! That airport sequence presents a giddy 17-minute frame that celebrates the awesomeness of superhero pictures. Things happen in that extended sequence - joyous things that I never thought I'd ever get to see beyond a 2D comic book panel.

But, wait - Let me address one common nitpick. Certain folks have bellyached that, once again, an MCU movie has rolled out a tepid villain, that Zemo is a mere plot device that moves the narrative along. And, okay, certain folks aren't wrong. But have patience with Zemo. Daniel Brhl is a hell of an actor and he makes something out of this big bad. By the end, you may see Zemo as a tragic figure. You may even sympathize with him.

Okay, back to the gush. Chadwick Boseman crushes it as T'Challa. He captures Black Panther's regal stature and his grace and distinct fighting style. Black Panther didn't give a what about anyone else's motivations. He had his own agenda and there were many times when his vendetta drove him thru other characters' story arcs. He's such a force. There's this sense that the mantle of unstoppable badassery was passed down from the Winter Soldier to him.

And Tom Holland crushes it as Peter Parker and as Spidey. This is the webslinger I'd been waiting for. I won't say much more, except this last bit - it's the bit that probably gave me the most joy about this latest iteration of Spidey. Peter Parker lives in Queens, New York. And, for the first time ever, Peter's speaking with a Queens accent. That soupon of detail, more than anything else, got me promptly on board with Holland.

There's a lot of sideshow moments that still seamlessly fall in with the core narrative. The story always comes back around to Cap. CIVIL WAR slaps the static out of the MCU. It shakes up the status quo. I am so curious to see where and how the next Avengers story picks up. For now, I'll probably see CIVIL WAR a ton more times, probably cry more nerd tears. There are light, sparkly moments in the film, moments of breeziness desperately required to offset the more dominant moodiness and that undercurrent of seething fury. The third act, Cap and Stark's personal conflict comes to a head, and it's no joking matter. There's a sense of friendship irrevocably shattered, of bridges burned. It shows off Robert Downey, Jr. at his acting peak and delivering such a raw performance. And neither is Chris Evans chopped liver. I love the crap out of this movie.

By the way, I don't understand why people still elect to take off once the credits roll. But you know better. You'll stick around for two post-credit stingers.

I guess I have one major nag and here's a **SPOILER** alert. I have an issue with Zemo's end game crucially hinging on Cap, Iron Man, and Bucky all ending up in that Soviet bunker so that Zemo could show Stark the video clip of his parents' deaths. But, for Zemo, it seemed more a moment of serendipity than precise orchestration that all three showed up there at the same time. It bugs me.",1462579200,325,7027,4.6642453591606134
7705690,5,B01D9EUNBY,"This surprisingly somber Marvel movie carries its weight in themes of ideals/ politics, relationships, and especially loss. ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to its name. Friends and partners get hurt, the Marvel cinematic universe is changed, there is nothing but superhero-on-superhero violence, and there are a few twists and surprises thrown in too. For anyone who has seen the multitude of trailers for this movie first and foremost you're going to marvel a bit at how much of those trailer clips occur in the first 20 minutes of this movie and secondly how much (wonderful) misdirection those edited clips will cause. Just as you expect one thing, something else happens or happens in a different context and this is great because the film offers several worthwhile surprises. But make no mistake: there is truly felt hurt and loss felt by us and our favorite on-screen heroes that is at the heart of this film, and an absolutely fantastic (and satisfying!) introduction to the Black Panther and a very good introduction to the (official) Marvel cinematic universe version of Spider-man.

[NOTE: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD]
Though this movie is mostly somber in tone there is still the insertion of that particular brand of Marvel humor that naturally comes out through character interactions and though ""Civil War"" doesn't contain as much as some of the other movies it manages its share with most of it concentrated in the (joyfully fun) main team-on-team battle. These heroes really don't want to be fighting each other, but alas they do, and amidst all of the action in this main battle you will laugh several times courtesy of interactions dealing with Spider-man and Ant-man. The heart of this fight is fun and light and that contrasts very much with the heart of the fight between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, which has a painful-by-way-of-betrayal feel to it. You may be awed and dazzled at times by that fight, but you'll likely be wincing and cringing too, and hurting and stinging a little bit afterwards. Nobody wins. There are several other fights/ battles throughout the movie that all do a great job in advancing the film's story and by movie's end every single character has been given important and memorable and showcase moments (of course some more than others but nobody gets short-shrifted as they may have been in either one of the Avengers movies). And for anyone who is worried that this is ""Avengers 2.5"" as has oft been reported you better believe that it is still, very much and truly so, a Steve Rogers/ Captain America film. You may or may not respect him as much as you already do by movie's end but the film is driven by his will (to paraphrase his thought: ""If everyone in the world is telling you to do something that you know in your heart is wrong, even if they're telling you to do it for the right reasons, then it's your job to plant yourself like a tree before them and tell them, 'No. You move.'"")

At the heart of this movie are relationships: Cap to his team and to Tony/ Iron Man; Cap to Bucky; Tony Stark to his legacy/ to the world; everyone's to the body politic/ government(s); Bucky/ the Winter Soldier to his history and the people he's hurt; T'Challa/ the Black Panther to his title and his father's memory; and...some emerging romances. There's a lot going on and because so much of it is about relationships we connect to it, especially to Steve and Tony, brothers who are at odds and who hurt each other in very literal ways and who can't seem to help it; they are driven as much by their demons as by their ideals (if you get the chance watch ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the ""Avengers"" and then Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and finally ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" before you see ""Civil War""--very satisfying to do so). The conflict between the two is naturally driven by the governments of the world wanting more than oversight--they want control--of the Avengers and want to be able to decide what they do (and don't do). Cap A (Steve Rogers, Avengers team leader and heart of the team) and Iron Man (Tony Stark, team financier and political manager/ CEO), as do members of the team, disagree over what to do in this case. Tony, whose guilt continues to increase over collateral damage and who feels the constant need to protect what he loves (Pepper, his teammates, the world), capitulates to the governments of the world's demand for control if for no other reason than ""it's going to happen eventually anyways...and they're not wrong"" while Steve recognizes that those self-same governments, who have agendas, would then be controlling the Avengers as their own personal tool/ weapon and he's not willing to give up his freedom of choice and ability to do that. Speaking in terms of contemporary politics Cap has been painted as the Democrat and Iron Man as the Republican. Nothing could be further than the truth. Cap's ideology falls more along the lines of Libertarian (strongly favoring personal freedoms and taking responsibility for those freedoms and personal actions) while Stark's falls along contemporary Democratic (and some would rightfully argue Republican) tendencies toward big government and their control and oversight of personal liberties (i.e., ""government knows best""). These ideas/ ideals that these characters hold are important, contemporary, have been naturally drawn into the story, and completely satisfying. Both sides make important points/ arguments and while the fil favors one (I'm not telling...) it presents both with respectful balance. In short, you can see both sides and can pick your own side. And as the film presents, there are consequences to picking a side.

My last critiques will be to note the theme of loss and what I didn't like about the film (before I move on to major spoiler comments about individual characters). The main movers in this movie have all suffered or are currently suffering under loss: Cap, the ""man out of time"" has a confederate in his pal Bucky who is also a ""man out of time"" but Bucky is still lost to Cap as the film begins. Cap also loses Peggy, and he loses his team, and he loses Tony. Tony has lost his parents and we see how that has affected him (it's very important to the story), and he is losing his confidence, and his team, and his brother in Steve. Bucky has lost his freedom and ability to be self-determined. The Black Panther has lost his father. One could say the film's main villain is loss and how it affects us (oh, there is a main villain btw and...I'm not telling!). What I didn't like that much about the film was its first 20-30"" as pieces are put in place and we're getting our bearing and feeling. It's important for the film's pay-offs but it feels disjointed, and too somber/ heavy. I really didn't like the way that nemesis Brock Rumlow/ Crossbones was handled and dispatched. He's a villain from the comics worthy of far more screen time and respect. But other than these complaints (and a begrudging notion that ""The Winter Soldier"" is a slightly better movie) this movie is fantastic!

[WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. Do not read more if you don't want to know about surprising movie points before seeing it. These comments will reflect important character moments and/or highlights about them.]
Captain America: When Cap and Bucky are delivering Iron Man a major beatdown there's a point where you may gasp and mutter (as I did), ""Don't do it, Cap!"" when he looks like he's going to deal a death blow to IM. You need not worry.
Bucky/ the Winter Soldier: On team Cap of course. While Cap ultimately saves Bucky, true to the theme of loss, Bucky goes ""under the ice"" at movies end. Also, he remembers everything he's done and this lends his unwilling assassin a certain air of sadness. It's not happy being Bucky.
Iron Man: Tony finally learns how his parents died, and is surprised that it was Bucky who assassinated them. And what is worse, he finds that Cap know about how they died (though Cap didn't know it was Bucky). It's a pseudo-betrayal that cuts.
War Machine: On team Iron Man of course. Rhodey is cut down and left crippled by friendly fire. He's alive and convalescing by movie's end and still thinks the decision that he and IM made was the right one.
Black Panther: On team Iron Man, by default. BP fans rejoice! King T'Challa is all throughout this pic and keeps pace with Cap and Bucky. He is presented as a relentless hunter and is motivated by simple revenge but there is one point in the movie where he is stalled by a traitorous Black Widow. This is a fabulous introduction to one of my favorite Marvel characters and the film does him complete justice. He's an integral character to the film as he is an introduction to the African powerhouse nation of Wakanda and constantly poses danger to the hunted Bucky.
Sharon Carter/ Agent 13: On team Iron Man, by default of being a government operative. Or is she? She shares a kiss with Steve. Awkward!
Black Widow: On team Iron Man...and on Team Cap. While she fights on team IM she helps Cap out when she can. Great moment when she shows up at Peggy Carter's funeral and Cap assumes that she's there to convince him to get on board with the Sokovia accords. When she tells him that that's not why she's there he's confused and asks her, ""Then why are you hear?"" She says, ""Because you shouldn't be alone right now,"" and gives him a supportive hug. Tender moment.
Falcon: On team Cap. Falcon does more fancy flips and flops and his fighting style is so dynamic that it's really the coolest in the movie. And that alone is surprising.
The Vision: On team Iron Man. An incredibly powerful character he's learning what it is to be him, and to be human. When he walks through a wall into Wanda's room she scolds him, ""You know we've talked about this."" He also makes a mistake and both he and Tony didn't know that he could do that; that mistake was accidentally taking down War Machine.
Wanda Maximoff/ the Scarlet Witch: On team Cap. Ridiculously powerful, so much so that she plants Vision deep into the earth and is able to stop him, which he didn't know she could do, even while he was keeping her confined to quarters. There is nice development of a burgeoning romance between these two.
Hawkeye: On team Cap. Hawk takes down the Vision, buggers Iron Man, and goes mano-a-mano with Black Panther and he's given a great line at the end of the film when he's sitting in a max security penitentiary for criminals as he directs toward Stark, ""The great Futurist! Able to see the future and how the heroes will be locked up!""
Spider-man: On team Iron Man. Youthful to the point of distraction Spider-man features prominently in the main team-on-team fight. He is a bouncing, bounding ball of quipping energy and is funny. And young. And he won't shut up. Great intro here. It also doesn't hurt to see his awe at all the superheroes whom he idolizes, and that he gets beat up by Cap even as Cap throws mutual respect Spidey's way.
Ant-man: On team Cap. Their secret weapon and that secret is a big one, as he grows into Giant-man and causes all sorts of vexation for team Iron Man. They keep his character light and funny.",1462492800,3,11170,4.697448979591837

7705702,5,B01D9EUNBY,"The Captain America films have always been the strongest of the MCU in my personal opinion and Civil War is no exception. Although the narrative is nothing like the comics (which is completely standard at this point), the story is strong and the way all of these wonderful, headlining characters we've all grown to know and love are handled and balanced is nothing short of remarkable. The emotional poignancy is there, the classic MCU humor present, but the film also knows when to be serious and even down-right intense. It's a fantastic film from start to finish.

7705812,5,B01D9EUNBY,"No ""fancy-shmancy"", nor ""pick-apart"" review here.
Just someone who came up with the Marvel stable over the years, and noticed how the writing has evolved over the years, and reflected the changing times - as well as the artwork.
I'm just a fan, of the Superhero genre, as well as Sci-Fi and Fantasy - basically a brief interlude from the day-to-day ""Life"" stuff.
I'm used to seeing NYC get destroyed/transported or some other fate befall it every month.
The more explosions, fights, general mayhem and destruction (ie; Special Effects), the more I like it.
And occasionally the good guys win (who knew?), but they never give up - especially true for Capt. America & Thor.
I'm surprised they brought Thanos into the mix - I think the future looks bright for the franchise.
3D takes it up several notches, a worthy addition to any action collection in any format.

The included special features are standard, the 3D is well used, if a little understated at times. If you're going to buy the movie, this is the way to do it, but this set would've gotten 5 stars if it was still the same type of set sold a few years ago with all 3 discs and the digital copy (you know, the one that it says would be included on the package).",1480464000,,963,4.127659574468085

7705934,1,B01D9EUNBY,"The 3d was great.

Actions scenes were decent.

Let me just say that I LOVE the Marvel movies.  The stories are usually pretty good for superhero movies.  All the critics said that the plot and character development was awesome, fantastic, well fleshed out, etc, etc... I guess I must have gotten the Bizarro world blu ray of this movie because I didn't recognize not one of the heroes I have come to love to watch on the big screen.  It's as if their personalities had a complete overhaul.  And the motivations and plot were ridiculous on so many levels, it was a cohesive mess.  It just didn't make sense.

 And I got to say that that kiss between Sharon and Steve was all kinds of creepy, especially after the love of his life just passed away.  And yes, I read the comics and I do know that Sharon and Steve are an item but it doesn't translate well to the big screen.  Steves got more chemistry with Black Widow.  Personally the love story should have been axed.

 Then there is the whole airport scene that  didn't make sense because Captain is a GOOD guy, a communicator, someone who does the right thing no matter how hard it is.  And for him to fight with his friends without explaining why he was trying to save Bucky was just plain ridiculous.  And then ant-man gets involved after he vowed to lead a better life for his daughter, which was stressed over and over again in the entire ant man movie, that for him to jump in some fight for what???  It Makes no sense.

And why was Clint involved?  Wasn't he retired?

And why so little use of Vision.  I can tell you why... it's because he is the ultimate weapon.  He could have stopped the whole fiasco of the movie if he had gotten involved right at the beginning (on a side note...was him accidentally shooting down War Machine even likely?  He is made from an infinity stone the ultimate source of power.  Heck, if you really wanted to create a war between both sides War Machine should have been brought down by one of Captains guys).

And then Stark brings on spider man, a young kid, to fight with him, which also didn't make any sense since Stark went off the deep end about ""one"" kid getting killed in Sokovia.

Now don't get me wrong...I love ant-man, spider man, and black panther, but they weren't needed for the story.

Oh and before I forget...did Widow get super powers because in the beginning of the movie she manages to escape a grenade explosion inside a van without injury.  Just saying.,,

The whole story should have been about finding and saving Bucky, who should have acted more twisted in personality than he did.  Bucky should have been portrayed as unhinged, a loose cannon, a cold blooded killer,  but he wasn't.  It didn't make sense.

And then there is Zemo, the ultimate villain for Captain, who was no more than a side note with a fantastical plan to create a wedge between our super heroes, which had so many plot holes in it, it just outright gave me a headache.

 Civil War, the comic, is not something that can be truly translated to the big screen.  It's about a lot deep issues that creates a lot of death and destruction in the end. However, in the end, it was I who was disheartened by this movie.  To the movie producers please bring back our boyscout Captain America, and our Snarky non-conformist Stark. And stop overstuffing the movie full of superheroes.  And write one deep emotionally rich fun story for each heroes movie.

Please don't hate on me.  This is only one opinion.",1480118400,9,3481,4.470588235294118

But it doesn't have the surprise of say Ant Man being so good, or fun of the Hulk in the first avengers movie.  It also preys on this idea that people would hate super heros for saving their lives sort of thing, and doesn't seem to consistent with the characters which have been built to this point.  Would Tony Stark really grow such a conscience over night and want to give up power or control of anything over accidently hurting one or two people while saving thousands of lives?  Just too much of a stretch too even get on board, which is saying a lot of a super hero movie.

7705957,5,B01D9EUNBY,"This is more of an amateur comment on the BR, than the amazing film (along with the superb Winter Soldier and Captain America). So, thanks the Marvel Avengers, these are my first Disney/Marvel disks. Since I don't own that many disks, can only compare w. Warner Brothers (Hobbit), Sony, and some others.

And it's the first time I've felt ""eh"" about Blu-rays. Just comparing to, for example, the Hobbit's Desolation of Smaug and A Force Awakens. I popped DOS or AFW into the player and get blown away by the picture (Samsung TV). It's almost like seeing the films for the first time - it's enough to notice. Sound (through a speaker) is great. Don't remember having any issues re forwarding to specific scenes, or the menus.

But Civil War, WS - the menus annoy me. Most irritatingly if a frame is paused, there's this pop-up in the left corner - it's big, and it just stays there. There aren't a lot of ""chapter divisions"" so if you want to go to a specific sequence, you have to sit through or forward a lot. And I don't remember almost gasping at the picture clarity or sound the way I have with other discs. Finally, while all these companies are giving less re disks, out of the disks I own, the cases for the Marvel films feel the cheesiest - which makes me wonder about the disk quality re degrading, over the long term.

Hafta give this 5 stars re the rating system, and wouldn't want anyone to not see this film re a rating. And there's nothing really ""wrong"" with the Blu-ray, IMO - it's just, picture-wise, menu-wise, sound-wise IMO it doesn't give me the same pleasure re quality as other companies' disks have. I know the industry wants to get away from disks and force people to stream everything, but I like having my films in-hand. A lot of folks do. So for right now I wish more effort had been put into Marvel Avenger disks.",1479168000,,1842,4.459940652818991

7706032,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I've always said, Marvel makes movies about the human condition that happen to have Superheroes in them. This is hands down, one of the best to date.

Just when you think you've gotten to the big crescendo, when things start to calm down and get back to normal, Marvel slides in another variable that rips the team to shreds. We've seen this coming, almost from the beginning of the Captain America arc, but MAN, it was heartbreaking to watch.

7706071,5,B01D9EUNBY,"So let me get this straight.....

We literally get to have a movie where Capt. America, Iron Man, Black Widow, War Machine, Vision, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and then we also get....Spider Man (well, it's more like spider boy or spider young man), Black Panther and my favorite - Ant Man!  What?  Did that really just happen!?!?!

Ok, so forget that Crossbones is in the movie for like 2 seconds (which is disappointing).  Forget the fact that the only other villain in this movie is....wait, who is the villain in this movie?  Fredrick Zoller?  Nope, wrong movie....same actor though.  Baron Zemo?  Nope, just Zemo.  While I love Daniel Bruhl as an actor, I don't think there was enough depth of character for his villain.

That being said, this movie crushes it with super hero battles (the airport scene is STUPI-DICULOUS! - stupid - as in crazy/bananas/amazing - and ridiculous) and fills in some plot lines that make the Marvel universe seem very small.

For what it's worth, I can't wait to see when the Avengers universe meets up withe Guardians of the Galaxy universe.  I can totally see it happening sooner than later.

The only reason I didn't give this movie 5-stars is because the first 30 minutes of the movie is shot with this shaky-cam handheld effect that is quite dizzying. Scenes are cut into fragments, with a low frame-rate to add a sense of speed, but really it just adds disorientation.

I loved the performances and the characters were nicely integrated into the storylines for Avengers and other Marvel movies.  I'm not entirely crazy about this version of Spiderman and certainly NOT the Aunt May character for this movie.  But they didn't take away from my complete enjoyment of the movie.

The BR and digital versions have crisp clean video as they should and although my sound system is an aging 5.1 system, the audio was clear with ear popping surround sound.

7706207,5,B01D9EUNBY,"This is different from most of the other Marvel Universe stories we've seen so far...  because, for the first time, we don't have a clear ""good guys and bad guys"" distinction.  For this reason, many people I've spoken to aren't really ""comfortable' with this film.  Several have referred to it as ""depressing.""  And, to be fair, yeah, it is.  It's ""mom and dad fighting"" but this time they're really gonna get a divorce.

How do you know who to root for?  I know that, in real life, I'd be siding with Tony Stark... but in storytelling, here, I'm drawn to Steve Rogers' side.

The villain in this story... such as he is... isn't really a villain at all.  Some folks have complained about a ""weak villain"" but I think that THIS WAS THE POINT.  The ""villain"" is actually, in a certain sense, almost a sympathetic character...

As such, this film is almost TOTALLY a ""shades of grey"" film rather than a clear ""heroes and villains"" film.  We see characters we know, and love, going against each other.  For entirely believable reasons, where both sides have real, legitimate arguments in their favor.

Ultimately it's not a SATISFYING film... and when viewed ""stand alone"" would probably rank lower than I've rated it... but as part of the unified whole of Marvel movies (and TV series)...  it's really very good.  Unless it's the last film... in which case, that would be a terrible place to leave the audience!",1475712000,6,1408,4.685714285714286

7706210,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Civil War is an amazing film and shows the true potential of a shared universe that Marvel have created with the MCU. Quite simply, a film with this depth of emotion and characterisation wouldn't be possible without the building blocks having already been set up in several films over several years previously. It has storyline threads from many previous movies all the way from the first MCU film ""Iron Man"" up to the present, and brings them all together in an organic way that never seems manufactured, and pays off in an emotionally explosive ending that'll reverberate throughout the characters and their interactions with each other for years to come.

As a huge fan of the MCU my expectations for this film were sky-high, and it managed to not only meet those expectations, but exceeded them. Civil War is Marvel at its finest, and the director duo of Joe and Anthony Russo follow up their critically acclaimed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with a sequel that lives up to both the expectations people would have for it based on that film, and the general hype surrounding a movie of this magnitude.

I'd highly recommend this film, and due to the depth of the plot I'd also suggest several viewings to pick up all the details and to appreciate just how well-rounded and creative it truly is. I've seen it 7 times in both cinemas and on blu-ray now, and I'm still picking up on details and seeing things from new angles, and I'm sure I'll find more yet.",1475625600,,1466,4.678294573643411

I have read the comics, which obviously went into a lot more depth considering their size and scope of volumes dedicated to this, but this captured that feeling somewhat.

7706236,4,B01D9EUNBY,"Let's put it this way. The movie is great but it just didn't meet the expectations that I wanted exactly which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 and let me explain why in this review.

So, I had originally watched Batman V Superman at theaters back in April but I opted out of watching Civil War when it went to theaters in May. I still bought BvS when it came out on Blu-Ray but I also wanted to buy this one too because I really wanted to watch it. I've always loved the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I always watch all the new releases quickly after they come out. I wasn't the biggest fan of BvS either because it was way overstuffed, but I understood why. Anyway, enough of my babbling on and let me get to Civil War.

So, once again, Civil War was great but didn't completely meet everything I thought it would be. Anyway, of course for those who read the comics then you know what the ""true"" Marvel Civil War was. I will not write any major storyline spoilers here but the movie was a little misleading since the ""Civil War"" part of the storyline only really lasted for like 15 minutes in the latter part of the film. The movie does introduce characters such as the Black Panther and the new Spiderman who definitely surpassed my expectations which really surprised me.

The movie mainly focused on the subject of the Avengers always leaving havoc in their wake with no consequences and now the World LEader shave come together to create a law that would call upon the Avengers only when truly needed. This splits most of the Avengers as Tony Stark specifically believes that they should listen to the government, while Steve Rogers wants to keep their current path of freedom and free will. This causes a rift as they disagree. Plus, throughout the movie Steve helps his friend Bucky recover back to normal. This is all I am going to say because I do not want to reveal everything, but I just want to say that yeah the movie is really good and there are answers to questions that people have asked from when the Cinematic Universe started back around 2007-2008.

It is has a lot of plot twists and the ending of the movie will definitely leave you hanging for the next one. The main thing that bothers me is that the ""Civil War"" only lasts for about 10-15 minutes and isn't as great as I had hoped. The movie though is great and I would still recommend that you give it a try.",1475452800,5,2387,4.357303370786517

The 3D was good too. I have been leery of 3D Marvel movies ever since Avengers: Age of Ultron because it was lacking the 3D depth that the 1st Avengers had, and they admitted that they didn't want to be a slave to 3D in that one so it makes sense. Civil War, however, had the depth that you would expect for a 3D movie.
I just hope Robert Downy Jr. doesn't get too old and die before they make the rest of the movies. You can't replace him as an actor for his role.

Acting is well done and the action scenes are amazing especially the main battle sequence that's 3/4 into the movie at the airport. Seeing Ant Man come back in a Big Way was awesome and hilarious to see. Also Tom Holland's first appearance as peter Parker/Spiderman was how you say ""spectacular"" and I can't wait to see him in Spiderman Homecoming.

7706277,3,B01D9EUNBY,"I have to tell you while not revealing any spoilers. First let me say that I have pretty much the whole Marvel modern action movie collection which all happen to be the 3D versions as well. Frankly, the feel of the movie seems a little strained. Actors looked a little bored at times and if it wasn't for the payday they are receiving they might have taken a pass on this one. As for the 3D, the effects looked rushed and sped up, like early CGI we used to see in early animation and I will compare it to The Hulk with Eric Bana, the sped up action looked fake. We now have that here too. The CGI in Guardians of the Galaxy looked much better as did the 3D allusion. I have enjoyed SiFi a long time and in order to do so, one must suspend disbelief. You cannot buy into a SiFi or fantasy premise and then proceed to pick it apart as certain details not being believable. Its one or the other, if you understand what I mean. But here, I have to say, something went wrong in the movie writing, directing or production that separates this from earlier franchise releases, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, but the level of preposterousness here was to the point of distraction, even for me.  Back to the movie. The 3D effects were at best mild. I am a huge 3D fan and what this could have been and wasn't is a shame, this is no way on a par with Avatar, Star Trek, Martian, but more like a 20 year old movie converted as an after thought, like Titanic. If you want to see truly demo quality 3D check out (James Cameron's Undersea Challenge in 3D,, its stunning) The 3D effects in Civil War, being the high impact action movie it was supposed to be, just didn't seem to me to be up to the level of previous Marvel entries. Even the 3D Spiderman movies I have look more emersive than this. When action sequences are played out so fast, almost a blur, it is tiresome after a while to watch. Needless to say, fans should judge for themselves, but I won't watch this again.",1474848000,10,1964,4.237333333333333
7706278,5,B01D9EUNBY,"An excellent adaptation of a spotty comic book storyline. Plus an excellent introduction of Spider-Man to the MCU.

In a lot of sense this should be considered the third Avengers movie because of all the characters involved.

What it does do is bring into question all the lives that were lost during various Avengers' actions in previous movies. Other than Avengers; Age of Ultron, everything that happened that happened in the MCU would have been worse to astronomically worse if the Avengers hadn't been involved. This film does a decent job of bringing the ""real world"" reaction/response into the scenario, and how it shows the two sides is believable and realistic. Neither is 100% right, and neither is 100% wrong. They (Cap and Iron Man) are making decisions based on their own experiences.. Cap got screwed by believing in SHIELD when it was actually Hydra, intending to kill millions and take over. Tony was trying to protect the world and ended up releasing Ultron on it. So Steve doesn't believe in ""authority from above"" and Tony feels the need to be reined in. Nearly a complete flip-flop from the first Avengers movie.

Upon multiple viewings this movie is more similar to Captain America: The Winter Soldier than it would first seem. There are a lot more super heroes in this that Winter Soldier but the overall story and plot are more in line with that movie. That being said, there are at least three excellent action pieces. The first being Cap's Avengers vs. ""Crossbones"". The second being Cap's Avengers vs. Iron Man's Avengers (this one is awesome), and the last being Cap, Bucky vs. Iron Man. The first one is pretty cut and dried, and, IMO, the Avengers take a bit too much crap about the aftermath considering the alternative. The second one is awesome and if you like Spider-Man, and to a lesser extent Gi-Ant-Man, you are going to have a good time. The last one requires Tony to be a bit more emotional in his response. The end result works out well (and a hell of a lot better than the comics).

It seems like this storyline should be setting up a Black Widow story but I doubt that will happen. I do hope that some comments about legal proceedings or incidences based on this movie will show up in the Netflix shows if not the follow on movies.

7706322,5,B01D9EUNBY,"My first taste of Civil War involves a different story line involving Cap being against the Hero Registration Act.  This plot is different, but I still enjoyed it a great deal.  I think this movie was made Cap-centric by adding Bucky/The Winter Soldier.  Otherwise, it would've seemed just like an Avengers film without Thor and Hulk.  Like many others, I was stoked to see Spider-Man.  I think their choice of actor and the direction they took the character is spot-on.  Black Panther has been a personal favorite for a long time.  It was exciting to see him come to the MCU.  He was different than I expected, but wasn't disappointing.  I look forward to his further development of character and story.  Ant-Man was a great addition, even it was a small part (or giant, depending on how you look at it).  Paul Rudd nailed it.  I was disappointed in the portrayal of Zemo, however.  He has a lot of potential that could've been used, but was the bad guy on the sidelines instead.  I look forward to Civil War II to see how this wraps up.",1474416000,,1038,4.510752688172043
7706323,5,B01D9EUNBY,"If your a fan of the Marvel Studios series of movies based on its comic book heroes, this latest installment may be the best. Back are Chris Evans as the eponymous titular character, and Robert Downey Jr. as Iron-Man, in a face-off over how much oversight earths ""enhanced"" heroes should, or will accept over their efforts to thwart the forces of evil. Sides are drawn and a whole plethora of characters are drawn into the melee on both sides. We get our first look at the Black Panther, Marvel's original African American hero, who will soon have his own film. There is also the first appearance of Spider-Man in a Marvel film, though he has appeared in five films produced by Sony Pictures. Both are portrayed nicely, and give fans something to look forward to later.  The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, (directors of the excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and the plot and action are handled in such a manner as to keep the story-line streamlined and clear, and to juggle all these characters and their interaction without it becoming a confusing, loud whirl of CGI. The story is loosely based on a story arc from Marvel Comics a few years back, but only loosely. It is pretty necessary that you have at least seen said previous Russo captain America film, as well as director Peyton Reed's Ant-Man, and Joss Whedon's Avengers: Age of Ultron beforehand, or some of the plot references and character relationships won't be completely clear. But, even if you don't this is a very good movie and it's worth owning. This purchase has two discs, the one is standard digital DVD, which regular and blu ray dvd players can read, but there's also a new format HD blue ray disc. My regular blu ray could not read this disc. I understand new players are coming out to read this format, but be advised if you are buying this expecting to pop it into your blue ray and get that experience you'll probably have issues if your blu ray is an older model.",1474416000,2,1966,4.601139601139601

But what was interesting at least for me upon reflection, is that it seemed that there was a more distinct character development involved in this movie. The character flaws were more pronounced. In fact if you did not pay close attention you might get a bit lost in the movie.
But once again with these movies Stan Lee makes his cameo and if you do not watch the move till the end of the credits you will miss another bit
of the movie.  Very good Avengers movie and as good if not better than Age of Ultron.",1474416000,,591,4.139130434782609
7706326,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Steve:  *Leads and then botches a mission in Lagos, Nigeria because he brought an unprepared team member AND totally misread the situation in the first place - leading to 11 people dying and many more injured.*

Wanda:  *Kills 11 innocent people by not being able to control her powers and being untrained enough for the mission.*

Steve and Wanda:  *Fluff off the 11 deaths in about two lines of dialogue, plus a couple of furrowed brows during the meeting with Ross.*

Steve and Wanda:  *Never refer to the screwed-up mission or the 11 deaths again. Doesnt really seem to bother them.*

Wanda:  Waaaah! You locked me up in my room!  How dare you??  *Proceeds to escalate airport fight to deadly proportions, causing injuries and millions of dollars in damages*

Steve: Literally CHOOSES NOT TO DO the Right Thing (which is protecting the many) and runs off to save his one pal instead, becoming the catalyst for many more deaths and injuries and millions of dollars in damages  thus giving up the right to be Captain America (and he knows it; hence his throwing away the shield).

Fandom at large:  Everything Steve does is right because hes Captain America!  We love Steve and Wanda!

Tony Stark (with not too much screen time but making the most of it): *Takes complete responsibility for all his actions, especially blaming himself for Ultron even though hes clearly NOT completely responsible. In fact, takes utter responsibility and blame even at the expense of his own health and well-being.  Cares probably way too much. Listens to the pain of a mother who lost her son in Sokovia; lets it affect him personally and terribly. Tries to the utmost of his ability to keep the Avengers safe and together. Pays for all their mistakes and embarrassments, including stuff they blow up and destroy  and probably funds an army of lawyers and advisors to pay damages to the people injured and the families of the people killed as collateral damage on Avengers missions.  Keeps Wanda SAFE in a SAFEHOUSE because shes a visa-less foreign national who could be killed by Rosss goon squads or imprisoned without bond at any time - also because she just KILLED 11 PEOPLE. Feigns going along with Ross even though he doesnt trust Ross, because he wants to keep everyone safe and together and knows politicians don't stay in power forever and that contracts can be negotiated. Tries valiantly throughout the story to use reason and rationality, offers of compromise and negotiation, to get Steve to at least listen to his side  because guess what, the Avengers actually do need accountability. Is rebuffed again and again but still tries. Brings Spider-Man to the airport SPECIFICALLY to web em up and capture HIS FRIENDS WITHOUT HURTING THEM and finds its Caps side that escalates the war. Has to endure the grave injury of his best friend Rhodey and no doubt blames himself for that too. Goes to Steves side IMMEDIATELY when he gets the evidence that Bucky was not the Vienna bomber, to try to make things right. Bravely goes alone in a helicopter through a raging ocean storm to the Raft, at tremendous danger to himself, to try to find out where Steve is  knowing Ross could lock him up, too, and no one would be the wiser. Is stunned and appalled by what he finds there, but has to play the high-stakes game and get his information and get out if he wants to somehow save the Avengers and help Steve. Has to endure the cruel jibes of Clint, which he hides his feelings about.  Escapes the Raft, flies more than 6,000 miles to Siberia, ALONE in the armor, to try to make amends. Almost succeeds until he finds out his erstwhile friend kept the most terrible of all secrets from him for two years. Reacts as any human would (since he JUST SAW video footage of the murders of his parents, and the murderer is standing right there).*

Fandom at large:  Aggghhh!  Tony locked up Wanda and brought a child to the airport fight and then he attacked Bucky!  Hes a spoiled rich guy with no feelings and no morals!

Civil War screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (on the Blu-Ray): Steve is better than Tony and a greater moral character.

Tony Fans: what???

The movie, as a whole, was great, but listening to some of the commentary on the Blu-Ray from the Russos and the screenwriters seems to directly contradict how Tony's story arc actually emerged onscreen. Tony was BY FAR the more sympathetic character when compared with Steve - I can't tell you the number of people who have said they went in to the movie as Team Cap and came out solidly on Tony's side.

It's pretty clear the Avengers DO need accountability - an idea that Tony, by reason, rationality, and almost pleading, tried to get across to the stolidly non-responsive Steve. If 117 countries say so, then something needs fixing. You can't just imperially say ""our hands are the best hands"" -- that's a dangerous notion, and says who, anyway?

Chris Evans' s Cap, in fact, was a stubborn lump throughout this movie (what the heck WAS his motivation for refusing the Accords - especially when it was clear that they were open to negotiation and discussion??) -- only coming to life at certain times (the church scene was nice...) while RDJ simply blew everyone else off the screen with his emotion-driven arc.

I simply found this movie very one-sided, as much as I liked it. Cap's side and his bullheaded stubbornness were never explained clearly, while Tony (with MUCH less screen time) got to portray a fully realized argument and a full range of emotions explaining and illuminating his side and his feelings. Some critics and fans are calling this ""Iron Man 4,"" with very good reason. As one major critic said, it's odd that the movie is called ""Captain America"" when Captain America is the least interesting character in it.",1474329600,,5799,4.7326043737574555

On the plus side the movie is fun to watch. The special effects were superb and the acting and action was wonderfully enjoyable to watch.

7706352,5,B01D9EUNBY,"'Captain America: Civil War' is a vastly entertaining super-hero film that in many ways is superior to the previous Captain America films  in fact, watching this you can't help but feel that this feels more like an Avengers film, in that while much of the focus is still on Cap there's such a rich tapestry of character background being unfolded in the film that you're left thinking more about the collective Avengers, particularly the surprisingly-entertaining sub-plots involving the introduction of characters like Spider-man and Black Panther (both of whom we'll be seeing more of in their own spin-off films.) For instance, seeing the extended scene of Tony Stark meeting with Peter Parker at his Aunt May's apartment seemed to me to take the film in a different direction, beyond just a solo focus on Captain America, and you know, it works.  All of the characters presented here were fascinating and kudos to the film writers for the efforts to bridge so much of the Marvel cinematic universe characters together in this one film, with countless references to other Marvel films in addition to numerous 'Easter eggs' directly from the comic books.

To be fair, the story can be a little meandering and the film's villain is largely anti-climactic and ridiculously unbelievable, but who cares?! Everyone knows that you're watching Civil War to see the heroes go head-to-head in a massive battle royal and this film doesn't disappoint. When the film finally gets to the inevitable clash of Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man, with each side composed of some of Marvel's most powerful characters (no Hulk though - shame) it's like something straight out of a 10-yr old's imagination as one Marvel comic super hero is paired off against another in a giant free-for-all battle (but one more of friendly fire and pulled punches  pretty sure Iron Man and War Machine could have caused much more harm with their combined arsenal if they really wanted to.) Speaking as a previous comic book fan (more of a late 70's  80's Bronze-era fanboy, to be more accurate) this giant super hero fight scene was just too much fun. You can forgive the lack of plausibility and utter silliness (even Spider-man points out that Cap's shield does not obey the laws of physics) because the incredible action sequences are just like watching a huge comic book cross-over come to life on the screen. It's just great stuff.

Chris Evan's truly owns the character of Steve Rogers/Captain America at this point and you really believe in his character, and that ultimately his intentions are the best, although Tony Stark/Iron Man does come across as sincere in his view for the opposing side. But to be honest, I really wasn't following most of the ridiculous ""Slovakia Accord"" or whatever the heck the plot point was. Seriously, they could have been bickering over ice cream flavors as long as it led to the pinnacle fight sequence at the airport. In fact, to be completely open, the film gradually loses it's edge beyond that big fight. Sure, we want to see what happens to the annoying enemy character that triggered the Winter Soldier to go on a rampage for some reason, but once the film finale is revealed it's rather anti-climactic, other than the final slug-fest between Cap and Iron Man. Truly, it's a great film, but don't read too much into it, particularly the plans of the Zemo character which, if you really think about all of the convoluted steps involved, didn't make a ton of sense and the whole thing could have fallen completely apart due to the slightest variable in his scheme. Yes, that's how baddies usually work in films, but to an analytical mind the details of his silly scheming could keep you awake at night.

'Captain America: Civil War' was a blast of a film that ultimately felt like Avengers 3, and that's completely fine. Go into watching this film expecting to see a dozen or so Marvel characters all competing in a vast, complex story that, although silly, is two and a half hours of genuine fanboy fun.",1473984000,,4007,4.823871906841339

7706381,4,B01D9EUNBY,"This was a great movie. There have been a lot of duds lately, and I was surprised that this one actually got me off of the computer for the duration. It's full of plot holes and I have no idea why the tertiary heroes like ant dude and spidey boy were even there, and that kind of detracted from what could have been a really good movie about the rift between Cap and Tony. I'll just add my own quirky thoughts....

The effects for Young Tony were stunning. Almost creepily so. We are quickly coming to a point where we are not going to need actors. Voices won't be far behind. For some actors, not necessarily the ones in this movie, that point can't come soon enough.

I'm not buying Tony wanting government oversight. In fact, I'm not buying any of these characters wanting government oversight, except Cap. He's the only one out of the bunch that the government never really screwed. Yet somehow, Cap is the one to lead the resistance. Romanoff. Good God, Romanoff of all people to go with government, after what they did to her in Russia. This might have been more believable if they had stuck more to the original Civil War story, but they would have needed more movies and actual X Men for that, and they're all over at Fox. So we have to hand wave this stuff.

Imagine Bucky as Cap's psycho girlfriend. Somebody would have had an intervention by now, but because they're not in a sexual relationship, this is all OK. One minute everything is OK, even good, the next she is beating the crap out of him and everyone else. No matter how much I loved my friend, at some point I would have to say he was killing too many people in his ""altered"" mode to let him roam free, and he would have to be killed if that's what it took.

OTOH I get teary eyed watching two war buddies from The Greatest Generation sticking together no matter what. At that point, Bucky is all Cap has left from his past. Do you know anybody who would go as for for you as Cap did for Bucky?

Again with Bucky.... Hugh Jackman is about to hang up his Wolverine claws. Sebastian Stan is young, good looking, and is a great actor. The Winter Soldier character has a lot in common with Wolverine-- he's a super soldier who's suffered a lot of experimentation, there's a lot he can't remember, he's got anger issues, and oooohhhh the angst. I bet he's got that Cartwright Curse going, too. All he needs is a custom leather jacket and a motorcycle. Think about it, Marvel. You may never get Wolverine back from Fox, but you don't really need him.

Overall, this movie was kind of silly, but I really liked it. That's because I like bad movies. I like The Hot Chick, Gods of Egypt, all the Twilight movies, Barbie in Princess Charm School, the solo Minions movie-- my taste is bad and it really runs all over the place. This movie imprinted on me against my will. I eagerly await Bucky's Big Adventure.",1473724800,,2870,4.385338345864661

7706408,4,B01D9EUNBY,"My new all time favorite comicbook movie, stunning in everyway and goes beyond its core of just being a fantastic superhero movie,this is an amazing movie all on its own....MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS 3D IS DUMB WHERES THE DVD COMBOS MARVEL",1472688000,,233,4.7073170731707314
7706409,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Given that there are 200+ posts out here already about this movie, I'll be brief in my thoughts here. The movie is absolutely fantastic. The pacing is superb and the quality of the character development is second to none. There is real hurt in the events of this movie, unlike the forced and superficial kind displayed in other movies of this genre. While I would never describe a Marvel movie as ""dark"", this one is certainly as close as I can imagine any will come. It sets up Phase 3 for so many directions and opens new veins for storytelling.
Where the movie truly shines however is in the screen time allowed for the multitude of characters at work here. Even more heroes than we see in the Avengers titles and a villain that isn't a moustache twirler (side note - this element is what makes or breaks a superhero movie in my opinion). I have thought for some time now that the Captain movies are the best of the MCU b/c he is so grounded in ""plausible"" (it's a superhero movie so the term is relative) espionage story lines. Unlike the other-worldly doings of Thor or the technological sphere of Iron Man, Cap has his boots on the ground and is there doing the dirty work. He's running down leads and scrounging for clues to try and solve the riddle in front of him. And lest we forget the backbone of this movie, there is always the relationship between Cap and Falcon. The dialogue is snappy and the chemistry between the characters compels the movie.
So, no spoilers for the last 15 or so people who haven't already seen this, but I highly recommend this in any fan's collection.
PS - I was considering taking a star away for Amazon's crap-tastic idea of only allowing Prime Members to pre-order the movie and then decided against it. I figure that a better plan is to not buy the movie here and support a store out there that will still show the same loyalty TO ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS like Amazon did in the past. Hopefully, enough people will do likewise that Amazon rethinks this practice in the future.",1472515200,3,2016,4.480978260869565
7706410,3,B01D9EUNBY,"I have been a huge fan of the Marve Cinematic Universe and have watched every movie back to the Incredible Hulk at least 3-5 times each. Captain America ""The Winter Soldier"" is my favorite of them all. While I was excited to see Civil War, I was unsure of how the infighting would make a useful additon to the universe.
The pros: The acting is great, the special effects are great, and it certainly has the ""feel"" of Marvel movies.

The cons: When it was over, this movie seemed completely unnecessary and more of just a very weak set up for future movies. As usual, we find the superheroes are not perfect people but flawed just like everyone else. Emotions run high and things boil over to a breaking point and the heroes turn on each other and end up taking sides to fight.  Only one person gets more than bumps and bruises out of the battle, and that happens by accident which is even worse. Although the emotional climax of seeing the heroes you have rooted for suddenly fighting each other brings a lot of intensity, it basically falls flat as just a show.
Stark has always had a temper problem and to see him so easily manipulated by the simple human villain is disheartening. Black Panther's acting is terrific and certainly will bring interest into his stand alone movie later in 2017. Vision's introduction in Avengers 2 was very exciting and I was excited to see him again. However, he appears to be somewhat confused about what to do and how to use his powers and by the end of the movie I was much less excited about him in future movies. Of course, the whole point is the climax of Cap and Ironman's always heated exchanges through previous Marvel movies.
I gave it 3 stars because it had its moments and if you are keeping up with the MCU, it gives a lot of info that will be important later on. But I feel that the whole point of the movie was exactly that, to set up things later on.  I've found all of the movies to date to be great as stand alone movies that would be worthwhile even if you haven't seen any other Marvel movies. This movie does not do much as a stand alone and the end result is they just fight, have a little reconciliation at the end and on we go to the next movies.
While I think it was worth watching as part of the MCU, this is the first movie in the MCU that I have no interest in watching again.",1471996800,8,2338,4.285067873303167

Four people with way too much power.

But, besides make the argument good, the Russos solidify it by making faults in Cap. It gets to a point where he is in complete denial and even Bucky says he still killed people and this isn't worth fighting over.

Don't let anyone tell you different. The ending is not a clear winner. Stark got the accords passed, but he now only has three Avengers. Cap escaped, but he's now basically claiming political asylum. Throw in the fact Lang will never see his kid again, and it's perfect 'We all got a rough deal'.

7706439,5,B01D9EUNBY,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is not only the best ""Captain America"" movie yet, but it may just be at the very top of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, due to its emotionally satisfying themes. That may seem like extremely high praise, so I will explain why I believe that to be true, as well as why I think this is the most mature Marvel film to date. Loosely following the events of both ""Captain America: The Winter Solider"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" while still harking back to previous films from this universe, this 13th installment in the ever growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, follows the team on different paths as they are once again pulled together.

 Opening the film in the past, audiences will be given a look into the life of the Winter Soldier, as his character will later have the biggest impact on the story at hand. Flash forward to the Avengers. The team is realizing that the events from the past have killed many innocent lives in the process and they must decide whether or not they want to sign the ""Sokovia Accords"" and be restrained by the government, and only released when called upon. This divides the team stronger than ever before, creating friction as to what the right move truly is. Then arrives the Winter Soldier. Still brainwashed, Bucky causes Steve to go after him (a fugitive), thus sparking the war of family and friendship within the team. This is just the basis. There are many levels to this picture, including the addition of Zemo as the side villain.

 This character served a very pivotal role in my opinion and definitely does not deserve the flack he is receiving. Daniel Bruhl is terrific in everything he is in and he only justified that more with this character. Without giving anything away, his character is involved with the heart of the story and is the reason for many actions/motivations. This review has been very dour so far and that is due to the fact that the entire first act of this film is extremely sad, but enjoyably so. Unlike certain unnamed films, this has a very light tone which elevates enough of the somber moments, making for a very balanced film throughout.

 Speaking of the light tone, the addition of ""Ant-Man"" and ""Spider-Man"" was absolutely fantastic and needed for this depressing story. It is hard to watch the characters having to fight each other, especially when you have come to love them over the last eight years, so it was necessary to include some fun. Paul Rudd is great once again, ""fanboying"" out just like audiences, and his action sequences are nothing short of crowd-pleasing. That being said, ""Spider-Man"" is still the standout here. Tom Holland gets a very solid introduction as to who he is, where he has been, and how he got his spider abilities. The chemistry between Peter and Tony was masterful and I could not get enough of it. ""Spider-Man"" steals the show with his contribution and I cannot wait to see more of him in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" next year. Note to Sony: Back the Hell off and let Marvel do their thing with Spider-Man, it took 14 years to finally get Spider-Man right and it shows in this film!!!

 Within two scenes of meeting ""Black Panther,"" they are able to establish his past, why he is present, and what his motives are, as far as siding with ""Iron Man"" goes. No, he does not have a clear side, but that is for specifics that cannot be discussed here. Chadwick Boseman is great, his action sequences are terrific, and the set-up for his future film definitely makes me want to check it out. It may seem like this review is overly character-driven, but that is exactly what this film is all about. Developing character in characters you thought you had already known from front to back. The excessive amount of layers in this film work in many more ways than one.

 Joe and Anthony Russo have proven why they are the best thing that could have ever been added to this universe, directing this film with ease. Bringing on the directors of ""John Wick"" (Chad Stahelski and David Leitch) was an incredible idea, as the action sequences throughout this entire film are some of the best you will ever lay eyes on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I believe that will be a high standard even for ""Avengers: Infinity War Parts 1 & 2."" If for some reason you walk out of this film disappointed, I can confidently say that you are crazy to not be blown away by the action throughout this picture, especially the incredible airport sequence.

 ""Captain America: Civil War"" is first and foremost a Captain America sequel, while simultaneously being a great Avengers sequel. Directed brilliantly, terrifically performed all around, with jaw-dropping action set pieces and a very raw emotional core, after thinking long and hard about it, this film is my favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date, hands down. Simply due to the fact that it has the most emotion, energy, and characters all put into one film, satisfyingly. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a triumph in every sense of the word. Absolutely amazing entertainment. Marvel continues to impress. BETTER THAN SEX!!!",1468022400,3,5097,4.74040632054176

7706453,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Released in 2016, Captain America: Civil War chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Brhl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.

Im a big fan of Steve Engleharts outstanding run on the comic in the 70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwalds notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap & Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. Youll see these elements in Captain America: Civil War. The occasional interludes with Caps babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. As for The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his pet falcon Redwing.

Since the plot ties into Caps leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.

Lastly the core question of the titular civil war is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avengers autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says No way.

The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.

But I have to say I was a little disappointed that Dane Cook wasn't in it. My wife Karen agrees. The only thing keeping this film from achieving pure Cinematic perfection was the absence of multi-talented actor-slash-comedian Dane Cook.

It was awesome to see Antman again and to get a sneak peek at the new Spiderman before he gets his own movie. Robert Downey, Jr. And Chris Evans were excellent as usual, and I could watch Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch all day. But it would have been really nice to see Dane Cook in the mix as well.

Now I'm not saying Dane Cook needed to play an Avenger necessarily. He could have been like a UPS delivery guy, or even just the voice of Tony Stark's newest computer entity -- I mean can you imagine the witty repartee Dane Cook and Robert Downey, Jr. could have engaged in? It was a real missed opportunity if you ask me.

Anyway, the scope of the film was awe-inspiring and exciting at every turn. The plot was unpredictable and the story well-developed.

People keep talking about how Black Panther is really good here...it's just cause he has the least amount of villainy behavior to do to advance the plot. He also has a really terrible accent, which I work with a bunch of people from different parts of Africa and my view is a bit skewed due to having the real deal around me constantly. It also reeked of typical childish grad student silliness where all the white guys are nuts and thankfully a saintly minority character (which shows the pathetic western liberal ethnocentrism on display) is there to help them cause he's the only sane one in the group but only when the plot needs him to be and only when the plot needs him to be. He sadly spends most of the movie as a lunatic revenge minded prince with the power to run as fast as a car and cat claws, which were super nonthreatening.

I don't know why you would like this movie. I don't know why you would take your child to a movie like this either to soak up like a sponge a pathetic self defeated message that nobody is good and why bother trying. I wish I was making this up but pretty much that's the movie. Its' a joyless Bourne Identity knock off mashed together with an Avengers film all about how your heroes are really dangerous lunatics who have been senselessly slaughtering people and a terrorist who also kills innocent people is right. The fans deserve better, kids deserve better, and frankly so do the actors and film crews (excluding the directors, writers, and producers) required to play out these dumb images on screen.",1466640000,14,1858,4.513353115727003

Marvel has figured it out, they're called comic books because they are amusing, they translated the ""comic"" to film.

This superb latest instalment lowers the physical stakes and ramps up the personal stakes like never before with the characters we've grown to love over the years alongside some VERY welcome new additions with the most enjoyable action sequences of any Marvel movie to date.,1466380800,12,366,5.016393442622951
7706469,1,B01D9EUNBY,"Calling it the worst MCU movie is a bold statement to make since it is currently herald as the greatest superhero movie ever made. When this movie was announced, people were very excited because it will be taken inspiration from a very controversial comic that the fans dislike. People were more excited for the fact it is a superhero brawl and seem to forget how that comic book counterpart made everyone act like immature brats. Let me break down why I hate this movie.

1. Tony Stark is guilty into supporting the accords when a mother told him her child died in Socovia. Tony is motivated into supporting the accords because it was his fault for creating Ultron and it cost the life of a child who had the good intentions to help people. Spiderman has the same credentials as that kid that died, but Tony becomes a hypocrite and drags Spiderman into a freaking WARZONE. Then we learn that he never was supporting the accords because it was more of his guilt rather then the overall logical purpose of the accords. He locks up Wanda to ""save the world from her,"" but never stops to think that he is just as dangerous as her. So he should be locked up as well according to his logic. He was willing to lay his trust in the same people that nearly nuke New York and he has no leverage to disagree with his supervisors. Basically Tony sign a contract without thinking.

2. Steve is practically the worst character in this movie since he is also a hypocrite and an scumbag. When he tells Wanda that it was his fault for what happen in Lagos, but never did anything to save her reputation since the public and Tony are still blaming her. Steve never tells Tony that it was his fault for being too distracted to not see the bomb. Steve also accused the government for having agendas but then he becomes a hypocrite by not telling Tony and half of his own team about his true intentions in hunting down Zemo. Steve used the ""save Bucky Barnes"" movement to hide his true agenda. He then tries to compare his ""oppression"" to Peggy's, but the issue is that Steve is given a choice to sign while Peggy didn't have that Liberty to do anything because of her gender. The accords are made to check his powers because when Steve said ""the avengers knows what is best and are the safest group to have power,"" Steve is saying that the avengers should answer to no one and continue to endanger civilians because they are not willing to take responsibility for their own actions. He talks about ""freedom and Liberty,"" but that same ideology he followed is what created Ultron.

3. Black Panther is a one dimensional character that try to play off the fact that he is consumed by anger, but I don't see it. His arc is rush and the Russo brothers thought it was more important to explain more about his Black Panther heritage rather then go in depth with the relationship with his father.

4. Hawkeye being in this movie destroyed his purpose to why he quit the avengers to begin with. Hell even Tony pointed out if he cared about what his family thinks of this and Hawkeye dodges the question. Antman being in Captain America's team ruins the the relationship he was trying to built with his ex-wife boyfriend and his daughter because he will be branded a criminal again. That joke with Falcon is of course more important then his daughter according to the Russo brothers.

5. Zemo has motivation and could be a great villain, but he doesn't get enough screen time to himself to understand his motives more clearly. His plan is made of coincidences and has to get lucky for his plan to work since he had no control in stopping the kill order on Bucky, prevent the people to do an actual investigation that Steve requested, Steve successfully escaping with Bucky from Tony in the base and airport, and Tony coming alone so no one will distribute their battle. He never tore the avengers apart since Steve send a letter stating that they are still friends with disagreement and is willing to help Tony in the future.

There is more but I hit all of the key points. That is civil war and it amazes me that it is getting rave reviews when it is nothing but a self contradicting movie. The movie abandoned this discussion about power being given to the people or avengers and it is replace with Team iron-man and team Captain America. Call me a DC fanboy if that makes you feel better",1466380800,13,4362,4.487405541561713

The characters have become dull and predictable. The action is old, tired & boring. And the once exciting revived superhero genre has run out of gas. Technically the movie is good. But as entertainment it's not very good. Like any TV series, what was awesome the first couple of years become stale. The first hint of that came with Age of Ultron, when suddenly The Avengers characters looked like past their prime and only pale imitations of their once glorious selves.

7706511,2,B01D9EUNBY,"When I went to watch the film for the first time, I left with an intense feeling of disappointment. I thought the movie was only fun, and perhaps it was the initial shock of too much propaganda and hype that got me to this stage, So I went again, and a third time. But although I really wanted to like this movie, the thing is, to me this is the worst MCU movie to date.

First reason is the story. And I don't mean the background story, which is nowhere near the original Civil War storyline of the comics. I mean the MCU story that is being told in this movie. The premise is ok, but the execution is terrible. Captain America ends up like an obsessed friend trying to protect his dear friend Bucky at all costs, while claiming he's doing it for ""justice"".

On the other hand, Tony Stark seems to be ""just going with the flow"" as he really lacks the strength to justify himself and his actions in front of everyone who questions them. Lines like, ""it's the right thing to do"" are really not going to win you lots of supporters. Oh and don't forget that Tony was convinced into taking action because a woman showed him a picture of her son, who died in Sokovia (""You killed my son"". Hey if you say so we should be signing the Sokovia Accords right away. Give me a pen!).

Every other hero is there just for the fight scene (yes, THE fight scene), while Bucky is there to provide Captain with a fixed point. In fact, the movie could have done without Vision and Hawkeye easily. But hey, the fight scene was important I guess.

The second reason is Spiderman. His appearance in the movie was without a doubt a comercial decision only, period. How else can you justify such a meaningless cameo (shameless plug)? Spidey is there just to inform the audience ""We've got Spiderman back, please watch his next movie"". You even get the blatant propaganda line at the end of the movie ""Spiderman will return in Spiderman Homecoming"". As far as propaganda goes, this movie does it perfectly. But the price paid for this is huge. Spiderman appears, talks to Tony, goes to fight, fails miserably and ""look for more Spidey in the future"". What a waste of valuable screentime that could be devoted to really make this movie better.

And third reason is the villain. Out of the many villains out there, this movie's villain is the worst there is. Not only has he the most boring and commonly used reason to be a villain (They killed my family now they pay!) he does not feel like he's running things. In fact he's there because the movie needs a villain, someone the audience could hate. But instead, Captain America is the one running things, he's the one causing the break-up, he's the reason for the whole Civil War. In the end Cap feels like the villain. I think that this was not intended, and the producers felt this too. So they added the last scene where Cap sends Tony a letter stating: ""Hey, sorry for everything, perhaps you are right but I am too. So please call me when you need help"". Excuse me?

But the worst thing is, this movie sets up the pace for the Infinity War Saga and, frankly, I really don't like what I'm seeing. The Avengers are broken and don't have another opportunity (movie) to fix things before the Infinty War Part 1, unless Dr Strange, Black Panther, or Guarians 2 take care of that (not to mention Spiderman Homecoming). In which case that's really bad for everyone. So, in that regard, perhaps Infinity War Part 1 will be ""Avengers make-up before Infinity War Part 2"" instead, which frankly I don't find in any way amusing or exciting. And to top that, movies of individual heroes are getting boring and repetitive (see AntMan). This of course is pure speculation, but after seeing Civil War I really fear for the future of this franchise.

Shame really, how this movie missed and squandered a great opportunity for greatness. Such a great stroy arc in the comics, went down to ""It's my friend Bucky"" in the movies. Perhaps I'm getting old, or perhaps I was a victim of ""too-much-hype"" syndrome. But the fact is that Civil War has taken away a lot of the love I got for the whole MCU  universe as a whole.",1465171200,18,4127,4.456953642384106

7706513,5,B01D9EUNBY,I just saw this movie and was extremely impressed by the story line.  The tension between members of the Avengers and the additional characters was believable and causes one to see value in both sides of the conflict.  A couple of humorous touches were lacking but they didn't totally put me off.  I adore these characters.  I was afraid they wouldn't be able to maintain the quality. My fears were unfounded.  This movie makes for a fun evening.  I highly recommend this movie.,1464998400,9,478,4.698795180722891
7706514,2,B01D9EUNBY,"This movie was less about Captain America, than it was about The Avengers, and Tony Stank.  It eventually broke down to a mindless slug-fest, and Marvel essentially took the easy way out by keeping Thor and Hulk out of it.  Don't expect to see a movie that had either the polish, or decent flow of any of the previous Marvel hits; you'll be sorely disappointed.  The fact that this movie was released on May 6th, and is out on video 4 weeks later, says more than any amount of explanation that I can do.",1464912000,6,503,4.329787234042553
7706515,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I think half of the things the Avengers got blamed for by the 117 countries are all a bunch of s***. They got blamed for almost EVERYTHING from the attack on New York to Hydras invasion and takeover of S.H.I.E.L.D. Out of everything the Avengers could be blamed for by the different countries just HOW were THOSE two their fault?  The Avengers TINY band of heroes were lucky to survive the New York invasion and STOPPED IT all by themselves with no outside help while the world government decided that it would be a 'good idea' to stop the invasion by dropping a nuclear bomb on New York, HOPEFULLY killing the aliens as well as any surviving humans that might still be in New York during the invasion and turn New York into a radiation filled wasteland if the Avengers hadn't stopped both the bomb AND the aliens. And that was all done in their first ever mission as the Avengers. Then HOW can they be blamed for what happened with Hydra and SHIELD, when the Avengers weren't even there at all to cause ANY of the property damage and loss of life except for Steve, Natasha, and Falcon. Out of everything else that was blamed on them, I would like to see the world government try and name ONE time that THEY could have handled any of those things THEMSELVES without help from people like the Avengers? At least the Avengers TRY and save peoples lives and TRY and protect everybody, without instantly resorting to LETHAL force, IF they can prevent it, unlike some people who would write off innocent civilians as collateral damage in the pursuit of beating the bad guys, even if innocent bystanders who have no clue whats going on until its too late to avoid it, get hurt or killed.",1464825600,12,1681,4.511475409836065
7706516,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Truly the best conclusion of any superhero trilogy ever made. Civil War brings Captain America's story to full circle, from hopeful and young Steve Rogers to the leader and fighter we know as Captain America. I found the plot to be incredibly compelling and wonderfully clever. When you think the plot was heading a certain way, it ends up going another. The movie is filled with small political and humorous gestures, but maintains a very personal aspect with each character. I loved the introduction of both Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland as Black Panther and Spider-Man respectively. Both actors lived up to the legacy that those two characters left in the comics, and I found Paul Rudd to be my favorite highlights of the film.

I think the divide between Cap and Iron-Man amazingly well done by the Russo Brothers. We see Cap, who isn't going into his first political bout, and Iron Man, who is facing immense stress and emotional turnover, duke it out on both political and personal issues. While I do side with Cap on both issues, both sides were amazingly crafted to invoke emotional responses from the audience.

Overall, great film, everybody needs to watch this. It really is the best Marvel movie to date, even better than the Avengers I would dare say.",1464825600,7,1267,4.807339449541284

7706519,3,B01D9EUNBY,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Captain America: Civil War""

Note: somebody will get mad at me if I don't say the word ""spoilers"" here.
Spoilers.

1. This is the latest commercial for the next Marvel movie. By now, if you aren't into the series, you can't start it here. There are too many threads from too many other movies. This is made for people that have seen all the MCU movies, not for the general audience.

2. Stark is still the best character. He is just about the only character that actually evolves through the movies. He's sort of the emotional backbone of the whole saga. This one gives him some more backstory and insight into his considerable guilt and pain. And he's still a smart-ass.

3. This movie finally gives us a new superhero that isn't lame. He's easily the best superhero in the MCU since Black Widow appeared in ""Iron Man 2"". He feels like a real character, coming from a vital place in the world, taking care of his own. I'm so happy Chadwick Boseman took this role. He's a great actor, and he needed to do something to get his character in ""Gods of Egypt"" out of my head.

4. This movie contains yet another reboot of Spider Man, but this one feels the most realistic yet. He's played by Tom Holland, who Americans may remember from ""In the Heart of the Sea"". Holland's character fits the style of the MCU better than the other versions.

5. Thor isn't in it! Hooray! This is a big one for me. It was kind of cool to see all the different storylines and movies start to merge, but Thor the Meathead Frat Boy with his overcompensating hammer has always annoyed me. Not knowing much about this movie, I was scared the whole time that I would suddenly see a rainbow bridge.

6. Since Natasha and Bruce are on hold, we get two new budding romances. One of them is Captain America and Sharon Carter. While there's about a 60-year difference in their ages, they both look hot, so it's fine. But the Scarlet Witch and Vision are eyeballing each other? WTF? The mind boggles.

7. No less than three characters in this movie attribute their sense of justice or revenge to the fact that their parents were killed. Can we please find some new kind of trauma to use? Spider Man had that angle covered, as do Superman and Batman over in the other universe. Can we at least get more tortured kids, like Natasha?

8. This is the 13th film in the MCU, and I think it's the first one where anybody cared about people dying. The MCU has built itself by existing in a universe where it doesn't matter how many people are killed in collateral damage, as long as it isn't actually shown, and as long as the fight scenes are awesome. Yet suddenly, like a light switch, it's now a concern.

But it's not even a real concern. The Avengers apparently didn't know about the Sokovia Accords until three days before the signing at the United Nations, so everybody had to take sides immediately. And once the Accords were signed, they were ignored for the rest of the movie anyway. They were a blatant gimmick to lead to the next gimmick, which was...

9. The ""civil war"". When I think of a civil war, I think of epic battles between citizens of a nation. Deep moral differences with extended social consequences. But that's not what we got.

The movie started by showing the delicately balanced teamwork of the Avengers to take the bad guys out. And yet when they took sides over the Accords, they fall apart. Their abilities to communicate and strategize disappeared like Pepper Potts.

Instead of calling the movie ""Captain America: Civil War"", it should have been called ""Captain America: Street Fight"". Yeah, it was cool to watch them beat each other up in the ways that a 10-year-old boy would imagine, but come on. They wouldn't all split up and take each other on individually, or in pairs. If one side actually planned something out, the fight would be over quickly. Or if Vision did more than cut open a couple buildings, the ""war"" would have been over even more quickly. But no. They kept using their powers in stupid ways that they would never have tried on real villains. And then half of them got arrested. The end.

Consider me underwhelmed.",1464480000,9,4155,4.507978723404255
7706520,1,B01D9EUNBY,"Captain America Civil War had great ideas and a lot of potential. However, the movie squanders a lot of it by being another by the numbers, predictable, and mind numbing action movie. While the action scenes were great, the comedy and oneliners among the characters never gave me a sense there was a Civil War among the heroes. The reason the heroes were divided was somewhat beliveable but again i never felt like there was a civil war because the characters don't show that. Whenever, CGI actions weren't thrown on the screen to get my attention, I was honestly a little bored by all the talking. I could guess what was going to be said and what would be said later. I see what Marvel was trying to do but i believe they didn't go the extra mile and show us an actual beliveable Civil War among the heroes with stakes for the heroes. Ultimately the villain was great and there may have been a nice twist in the movie but it isn't enough to alleviate the movie to make it as good as the better Marvel movies like Captain America The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, or Iron Man.",1464480000,8,1087,4.412935323383085
7706541,5,B01D9EUNBY,A beautifully told story about friendship. It's everything you wanted and more. The Winter Soldier is still the best movie in the MCU but this one definitely second to it.,1464307200,5,171,4.733333333333333
7706542,5,B01D9EUNBY,"After seeing Civil War I can easily say that it's my new favorite Marvel Movie. Not only did I feel like it delivered the action but the character moments were amazing. It had the honor of introducing two great characters Spider-Man and Black Panther which it does tremendously. Spider-Man has been my personal favorite since I was a kid relating to his story of being a bullied nerd with a lot of responsibility and they just totally nailed his introduction. Not only that Tom Holland plays him perfect nerdy, shy, bumbling, nice, and quick witted defiantly the best incarnation we have seen of Peter Parker and Spider-Man so far. Black Panthers journey in this movie is great too where he goes from the beginning to the end of this movie will fill you with tremendous joy....but just seeing him in action is a treat. Overall the story just delivers watching our heroes torn apart over such a genuine thing I was totally torn between Tony and Steve I could defiantly see pros and cons for both their sides and when it gets to the climax we are left shattered wondering where our story will go next but also with a little bit of hope. Sure Baron Zemo may be one in a string of not the most interesting villains but his ultimate plot was pretty sinister and really our conflict is more about our heroes. Ultimately I just really loved this movie with stellar performances, action, story, and the new introductions I have a new favorite that I can't wait to add to my collection when it comes out.",1464307200,6,1495,4.561338289962825
7706543,1,B01D9EUNBY,"Let me preface this by saying that all the previous Marvel movies in this series are my favorite movies of all time.  With that said, I truly hated this movie.  I never liked the idea of a civil war between the team members to begin with, but I figured they would slug it out, then eventually get the band back together to fight the real enemy.  I was stunned when this didn't happen.  The allure of the previous films was to see these powerful heroes work together for the common good. A little strife is acceptable, and actually fitting (and comical) considering the disparate personalities.  But, this was down right ridiculous.  I love watching the team members fight together and play off each others' strengths (ala Ironman bouncing a beam off Captain America's shield, etc...)  Now we see Nat and Clint fighting, which would realistically never happen, and Antman and Spiderman showing up and choosing sides based on who got to them first. Did they even know why they were fighting?  Both Ironman and Captain America were so far off their normal images as to be unrecognizable, and the plot was very thin.  Let's face it, Bucky was thrown in there to be the true cause of the rift; not the Sokovia Accords.  We had already seen Steve fighting to save Bucky once, we didn't need it again.  The writers had the chance to fix things when Tony went to find Steve, but instead they made it worse and left it that way.  I went away with a sour taste in my mouth because I had just watched two of my favorite movie characters try to beat each other to death.  I guess it's a personal preference, but I like to feel good after I watch a movie, especially one I had looked forward to for so long.  Also, another personal preference - I did not approve of the language.  Why the gd's all of a sudden?  I'm glad we didn't take our niece to this one.  The only plus is that Thor didn't have to participate in this travesty.  I think he would have once again called humans petty.",1464307200,20,1973,4.433333333333334

Whats left to say about a movie that within 2 weeks has amassed a $940 million global box office and taken the Marvel Cinematic Universe above the $10 billion mark?  Generally, my goal in writing these reviews is to recommend worthy films for my audience in the hopes of aiding the decision on what to see.  Whenever one of these massively popular films is released, it seems silly to review it.  I mean people that want to see Captain America: Civil War will see it regardless of what any number of critics say.  So then, why write about it?  Whats my motivation? In this case, I think the story is less the film and more to discuss its place in the company of the 12 other films that have been released in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).  Of course, I still find it useful to identify the good and the bad about the film and offer a summative recommendation, but given that most of my readers have probably already seen this film if they are going to, I want to offer something a little extra as well.

So, what are the 12 other films that accompany Captain America: Civil War? Its important to make that distinction.  For the purposes of this article, The X-Men films, Spider-Man films, Fantastic Four Films, and Deadpool will not be considered.  The 13 films pertinent to this discussion are those planned out by Marvel studios starting with 2008s Iron Man and include the following: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Marvels The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, and Captain America: Civil War.

So now that weve identified the players, I will take a moment to review the latest film in the franchise and discuss its place in the field.

Captain America: Civil War is less a Captain America film and more a third Avengers film.  All of the key players are present in this film except Thor and the Hulk, and the events of the film are an immediate continuation from the action of Avengers: Age of Ultron. The principle conflict revolves around a global agenda to put the Avengers under United Nations supervision. Tolerance for the devastation and civilian casualties that have resulted from Avenger-related battles has been exhausted, and at least one Avenger, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) agrees with the idea of putting the Avengers in check.  Starks persuasive and personal reasons cause a stir in the once unified Avenger team, but his words fall on deaf ears when it comes to Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris Evans).  Rogers believes that any supervision of the Avengers will only result in corruption and ineffectiveness.  Suddenly an ideological divide is struck that threatens to tear the Avengers apart from within.

The film does a pretty good job of introducing the conflict and representing both sides, although the reasoning for why one Avenger takes this side versus that side is ultimately rather arbitrary.  What is certain is that a line has been drawn (actually quite literally in one scene) and our heroes must navigate some rocky moral terrain.  While the main villain of this film is philosophical in nature, there is a human antagonist  named Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brhl) an ex Sakovian Colonel with some dark secrets and control of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).

This film is less distinctive from the rest of the pack than its predecessor, Captain America: Winter Soldier.  The thrilling political conspiracy that threaded through the Winter Soldier is replaced by a more standard Comic Booky genre story.  Subsequently, the action is a bit shakier this time around, regardless of the fact that Winter Soldier directors Anthony and Joe Russo helmed this film as well.  Nevertheless, the Russo brothers do direct the hell out of this film showing their range with expertly crafted chase sequences as well as some heavy emotional material.

Another plus is that like Winter Soldier, the story remains mostly rooted in reality, and Captain Americas motives continue to be protecting his homeland at all costs.  Additionally, Civil War boasts three outstanding achievements that no Marvel film before it has managed thus far.  First, it introduces two of the best new characters (Black Panther and Spider-Man, both slated to receive upcoming stand-alone films) and does it with panache!  Ill leave the details about these new characters out so not to spoil anything for the rare reader who has yet to see this film, but both are quite satisfying and Spider-Man especially receives a worthy reboot after some questionable recent attempts by Sony Pictures. Second, the Civil War battle is a remarkable scene. This scene replaces the Battle of New York from Marvels Avengers as the Infinity Stone in the Marvel crown. DC executives responsible for Batman v. Superman should take notes on how Marvel succeeds at fighting internal conflict with external conflict! Third, Captain America: Civil War manages to give all of its cast members room to breathe and make a memorable and worthwhile contribution.  No character is squandered, and as I alluded to earlier, this film explores some emotional depth but uses just the right amount of levity and humor to maintain an even tone.  Captain America: Civil War advances Marvels epic storyline yet another step forward and the Russo Brothers prove to be worthy of inheriting the Avengers mantle from Joss Whedon for the upcoming Infinity War films. A-

Captain America: Civil War is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 27 minutes.  As usual, stick around through the credits for two additional scenes.

and now in keeping with the Marvel cinematic tradition, I have a post-credits stinger for you!

7706549,1,B01D9EUNBY,I didn't like the movie. This is nothing like civil war in the comic. There was at least a 100 heroes fighting each other in the comic. This isn't a war it's a brawl because there's only twelve people fighting. They should have just named the move Captain America civil disagreement.,1464048000,16,283,4.568627450980392

7706561,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Initially I was thinking that they ended up giving up on a far better ending, but in retrospect if they didn't do what they did, this could have gone on forever.  It was a great movie to show a lot of characters ... basically this was 'avengers 2.5' since the only two missing were Hulk and Thor and they will be together in Thor 3 before year end.  We get to see Antman & (SPOILER ALERT) ""Giantman"" as well as Black Panther before he gets his own movie next year, and finally Spiderman who will also get his first movie with the new Marvel leadership next year as well.  I couldn't figure out the line up of who was which side and why, the government logic really made no sense in blaming the Avengers for all the destruction around the world since without them the world wouldn't have survived, but hey, that's movie logic I guess .... dispointing lines from Cap when the Sec of State (aka also superhero jail warden later ... huh?) offers that lame series of movie clips of the destruction and need to register all the heros.  I would think that someone would have pointed out that the destruction was minimized thanks to the Avengers not caused but oh well ... that disappointment aside (and someone pointed out that Vision offered a good Spock like logical explanation for the governments rationale), it was a spectacular movie that I know I will get the DVD and watch it over and over.",1463961600,7,1391,4.464566929133858
7706562,1,B01D9EUNBY,"When I saw the trailer I didn't like what I saw but I wanted to find out if there was a good reason to see heroes fighting each other, so  I watched the movie and the story was not at all satisfying. Suddently capitan america is not the guy that does the right thing, he doesn't care about sending police officers to the hospital because he is defending his criminal friend Bucky. That and many other things that I will not mention to avoid spoilers, is just like he is a completely different hero who will do whatever he wants without much concern for others. Really? This movie made me look at capitan america in a completely different way.",1463961600,15,642,4.394957983193278
7706563,1,B01D9EUNBY,"Superhero movies are done. Marvel is destroying them. This wasn't even a Civil War. It should be named ""Contrived Scuffle."" There are a lot of dodgy people saying this was the best movie ever. It's not true. I stopped taking it seriously when Tony Stark backed the government with registration because some lady's son got killed when his killer robot tried to start the Apocalypse. REALLY?

It will not stand the test of time. Do not recommend.",1463875200,9,444,4.766233766233766

7706565,5,B01D9EUNBY,"It was a awesome movie I'm on Captain America's side, I agree with him it was their choice to be the avengers and shouldn't have the government control them. I just wonder if their going make another captain America or continue the story in the third avengers movie next year. I seen the movie four times already.",1463875200,10,313,4.508771929824562
7706566,1,B01D9EUNBY,"This movie fails under its own seriousness and lack of cohesiveness. Its technically a third Captain America movie, but the film serves more as a character study of Iron Man. WTF?!

Characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man are also introduced, but ultimately add nothing to the plot. Its more of the same world-building that turned off many viewers in Batman v Superman, but viewers don't care this time around because they finally get to see Spider-Man in a Marvel movie. SMH Theres no reason for him to be there. He helps out at the battle at an airport in Germany (which in itself is an very strange setting to have the grand fight between two teams of heroes) and then shipped back to Queens.

Civil War just feels gray. The film is uneven: the first half is quite dull and boring, and its action sequences feel choppy and rushed, but its all in search of a decidedly more serious tone. It all changes when Spider-Man is introduced and, with a bout of suddenly quirky humor, it becomes something different. Its fun, but then after the main battle is over, the film returns to some of the more serious tone it tried to establish previously, and it does not go off so well. I mean, how serious can you take a movie that has a giant Ant-Man destroying property at an airport?

The film does nothing to rectify any of the recurring problems that the Marvel Universe has, especially in regards to featuring a sophisticated and memorable villain. Though there is no straightforward villain in a movie that pits two superheroes against each other, many of the strings are pulled by Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), who plays the villain. His motivations to do so are more complex, but it leads to a single line in the film and has no emotional payoff.

Lastly, in this thirteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one titled Civil War, nothing really happens! One or two characters are injured and some relationships are fractured, but we know that our beloved characters are going to survive and eventually work out the differences they have with each other. Unfortunately, this makes things much less exciting. Even if the emotional heft is great, there are no physical consequences to any of it. In the end, we know well be seeing all of our heroes together again in the next Avengers movie.  What a wasted opportunity.",1463875200,38,2323,4.697788697788698
7706567,3,B01D9EUNBY,"One word.  OVERRATED. It seems to me that the reviews for this movie are a product of groupthink. The movie felt uneven to me and the ending just made me mad.  I think there were opportunities to make a really interesting movie, but once again Marvel plays it safe.
The good parts were the action, Black Panther, and Paul Rudd. Panther stole the show not Spider-Man like so many people said. I found him to be annoying.  I mention Paul Rudd because he is the only actor that is genuinely funny.  Falcon and Hawkeye are not funny quit trying to make their lines witty.
SPOILERS!!!
Marvel again wastes a talented actor on an under utilized villain. Zeno was makng things happen, but I didn't know why until he explains it like a bond villain at the end.  Right as Iron Man realizes he's wrong about Bucky and they could unite against Zeno (which I knew wasn't the case from the trailers) he drops the twist about Starks' parents.  Then he just chills and let's then fight.  I thought he was going to wake up the other Winter Soldiers hence why they explained their presence earlier. Sadly no, we get another hero fight where Iron Man is right to be mad and Cap is totally a villain for defending what Bucky did. To top it off Cap knew about it!  Wait...what!? I've seen every movie and TV show and when was this established.  So Cap knows Bucky murdered the Starks and is still defending him.  C'mon I know he's your brainwashed buddy,but that's too much. That took me right out of the movie.  Then I'm thinking, end it like the comic and Cap turn himself in, nope. He hides Bucky and writes a letter and everything will be OK. Are you kidding me!?
I'm sorry that damn near ruined the movie.  A better movie would have been winter soldier 2 and redeem Bucky,  but now you can't and Cap looks really bad for sticking with him. I could go on about some other nitpicks but that's what really stuck with me.",1463875200,6,1901,4.397142857142857
7706568,5,B01D9EUNBY,"The ongoing Marvel vs. DC debate has always fascinated me. When it comes to the comics none of it ever really made sense; both companies have their share of iconic heroes and villains, with more than enough to please everybody. But it's been especially fascinating as comic book movies have become the standard by which all blockbusters are now measured. Once again, Marvel and DC are seen as contentious foes by the fans, but let's keep it real. In this particular case there is no competition. Marvel has no peer in this arena, and the utter perfection and sheer awesomeness of ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the best example of their superiority.

What started out as arguably Marvel's weakest first entry, the Captain America movies are now superheroes done totally right, combining mature themes with big, explosive theatrics. And in the case of 'Civil War', the film expertly juggles more than a dozen characters while introducing a few very high-profile new ones, like Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), without missing a beat. The credit has to go to co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who have given these movies the edge the Marvel Cinematic Universe so desperately needed.

The Avengers have always been a ""ticking time bomb"" as Bruce Banner so eloquently put it in the first team-up flick, but this is the first time they've truly imploded. And it wasn't space aliens or an evil robot that did it; it was a United Nations resolution. The film tears the team down ideological lines with one side backing Captain America (Chris Evans) and the other on Team Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), as the government decides to hold superheroes accountable for the devastation they've caused. In the wake of the destruction seen New York (during ""The Avengers"") and Sokovia (In ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""), the U.N. proposes the Sokovia Accords, which removes the autonomy the team has long enjoyed. The situation gets worse after an incredible opening sequence where Cap's team: Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), battle Crossbones (Frank Grillo) to a tragic conclusion. While their teamwork is fluid (and totally badass) as ever, a momentary lapse leads to the death of innocents.

The U.N. proposal quickly divides the team into two camps, but this isn't done arbitrarily just to make sure both sides are even. No, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely plays on each character's past history and current perspective. Tony Stark's continued guilt over the Ultron fiasco continues to weigh on him, and Cap's distrust of government, explored wonderfully in the prior film, drives his stance against submitting to the control of bureaucrats. Meanwhile, he's also forced to go on the lam to find his old pal, Bucky (Sebastian Stan), aka the Winter Soldier, who has been implicated in an attack that killed the King of the African nation of Wakanda. That brings into the picture the fearsome Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), on the hunt for some revenge.

It sounds like a lot is going on, and there is, which is why the Russos and the screenwriters deserve praise for keeping it so simple. What you get is literally everything a fan of these movies could want. The airport sequence alone, in which both sides, including Don Cheadle's War Machine, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man (displaying a power fans of the character will be elated by), and Paul Bettany's Vision engage in a super-powered battle royale is worth the price of ten tickets all by itself. It also gives us a look at how agile and funny Spider-Man is going to be as he enters his first real fight and trades quips with Marvel's greatest heroes.

And let's talk about Spider-Man because what Marvel has done with him is rather extraordinary. Knowing that nobody in their right mind wants another origin story, we're instead given a brief man-to-man chat between Stark and Peter Parker (with Marisa Tomei's Aunt May nearby) that captures everything we need to know. Holland is playing the youngest Spidey we've seen on screen yet and that injection of youth and vitality gives the entire MCU a different feel, a different kind of energy. Hopefully that can be recaptured in his upcoming standalone film, but Spider-Man is already an incredible addition.

The same goes for Black Panther, who is depicted as the unique figure in the Marvel Universe just as he is in the comics. He's not just some vigilante hero; he's the ruler of a nation, a Prince and now a King. And he acts with the regal demeanor befitting his position, and it comes out even more when engaged in combat, which he is frequently. Once again the Russos deploy an action style that isn't too far removed from the frenetic, jaw-jacking pace of The Raid movies. Let's put it this way: you notice the difference in the other movies the Russos aren't directing. They just don't have the same blistering choreography.

If there's anything that doesn't work it's a subplot involving Daniel Bruhl as Baron Helmut Zemo, one of the Avengers' most lethal foes. Here he's still depicted as a consummate schemer and strategist, manipulating the team in ways they couldn't even fathom. His plot reveals secrets that nobody could have expected and is perhaps the film's biggest twist, so try to go into it with as clean a slate as possible. The disappointment is that Zemo's plan should probably be a movie all by itself and yet it gets lost with so much going on elsewhere. Bruhl is still great in the role and captures Zemo's trademark arrogance, but he could have used more screen time.

While there will be many who proclaim ""Captain America: Civil War"" to be Marvel's best film yet and rightfully so because it certainly is their best yet, what's most amazing is that they are still capable of reaching such a high point. The MCU has been around for 8 years and thirteen movies now, incredible by any measure, and if they keep making movies as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"" they can keep going forever.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-Captain-America-Civil-War-3D-BD-BD-Digital-HD-Blu-ray/dp/B01D9EUNBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's Captain America: Civil War (3D BD+BD+Digital HD) [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,7,6302,5.082125603864735

7706570,3,B01D9EUNBY,"Fun film, but terribly paced. Felt like 4 hours when it was around 2 1/2 hours. I was excited to see this because Winter Soldier was surprisingly a great Marvel film which I never expected a couple years back. Even though there are way too many characters in the film and there are unfunny forced jokes that go on forever the film, it is enjoyable. Many comic book people will be disappointed because of a certain thing missing, but I will not give anything away as I hate such things. This film is good, no Dark Knight or even Spider-Man 2 (2004) for that matter but a very good, fun  film. I enjoyed the actual villain's story as well as the relationship of Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes & The Captain. Unlike Iron Man, Thor and the like, these characters are actually interesting in my view. Also a big plus that we are not stuck with the CGI Hulk and Thor for a change. Fun film, but way too long.",1463702400,3,899,4.351190476190476

7706573,4,B01D9EUNBY,"I agree this did feel much like a new Avengers movie but it's a much better movie than Age of Ultron. That second Avengers movie nearly put me off for good I didn't bother seeing Ant-Man (and his part in this justifies my thoughts it would be too childish) and I nearly didn't bother going to see this after reading a couple of bad reviews.

 However this new Captain America movie is what Age of Ultron should've been. A genuinely interesting story (although could've been stronger) yes with chaotic fight scenes but not as busy and OTT as Age of Ultron. It could've done with a trim, it goes for about two and a half hours but was a good enough superhero movie. Robert Downer Jr pretty much steals the show in this and you could be forgiven for thinking it was an Iron Man movie at times.

 I'm not a big Marvel fan but this is a lot better than DC's Batman v Superman.",1463702400,5,871,4.260606060606061

7706577,4,B01D9EUNBY,"An impassioned disagreement breaks Earth's greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words. It's basically The Avengers 2.5, but you already knew that. And like the preceding two star-studded chapters, most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together, slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the VFX budget like t-shirts from a cannon. It's a more serious take for the series, sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys (Ant-Man and Spider-Man steal the show on this front). Which is fine, it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldn't seem proper for Iron Man to be going all tongue-in-cheek while he's trying to punch his buddy's eyebrows off. That heavy-duty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed, though, and all told I was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up. There's a whole lot of action, as you'd have to expect, but this time it feels less grounded than in the past. It's as comic book as the MCU has ever been, really, with loads of Kool Aid-colored lights shining around the room, bodies flying through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds. And that's the focus, no doubt about it: action with a side of Bucky, whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that split the Avengers. Personally, I was more interested in that lesser-explored gray area, but at the end of the day it's Cap on the marquee so I can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads. It's a strong, solid entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise, but at times it tries to pull off too much. Could've easily been broken into two films, and I'm almost never one to recommend trying something like that.",1463529600,,1905,4.6726190476190474
7706578,1,B01D9EUNBY,"First I am a fan of Marvel but lets be honest the Civil War story doesn't follow the comic and is weak.  People want to give DC grief because Batman killed someone or used a gun.  Research it he has done this before on occasion.  Marvel civil war didn't follow the comic storyline and felt like the Nintendo Smash Brothers game, where they just had every character fight each other.  This movie felt like the What if comic series.  At least with Batman vs Superman there was a plot. A adversary had to be overthrown.  With Cicil War its just a dude trying to protect his buddy.  Weird.  And Tony Stark goes from being a alcoholic and anti government/ oversight.  To giving the government control over his actions, not buying it.  Marvel Civil War had great fight scenes but that doesn't make a movie.  I just found Civil War to be a lame story that went in a circle.",1463443200,30,866,4.383647798742138
7706579,3,B01D9EUNBY,"I enjoyed this movie but Marvel has a formula and they refuse to break away from. All the movies are seemingly a repurposed script, a large CGI budget, good actors, and lots of visual stimulation. There was very little plot development that the audience actually cared about. The strategy was to put as much action on the screen as possible for no real reason. It's becoming redundant and they are systematically killing a brand. Disney swooped and are sucking what is good out of a national treasure. I suspect Star Wars is the next victim. The story line is vaguely tied together and not really that interesting.

They are fighting a life and death battler and introducing themselves to each other at the same time. Then, someone gets hurt, so they stop fighting. It is much like kids in the playground. None of them seem to be able to negotiate or compromise. (Much like kids in the playground). The action was great. The special effects were great.

During one of the biggest times for the comic book industry
I'm talking the rise of Valiant Comics, Image Comics, Spawn, Bone, The bad girl craze,
Malibu comics, Spider man Maximum Carnage, The Death of Superman, Batman Knightfall, Sin City, From Hell, The Marvel vs DC Limited series and so on
When there was huge money to be made in collecting comic books
The market was at a all time high
Turok: Dinosaur Hunter issue 1 at one point was going for $100.00+

I bring this up cause i spent countless hours with my brother and sister boyfriend at the time going all over, 2hrs away from home going to comic book shops/stores (There was no Ebay or Amazon)
That's the tell of any hardcore collector we all have this OCD/Addiction
and I've seen first hand many a times how nutty comic book fans are
In 2016 i have no dog in the Pro Wrestling fight of DC vs Marvel
If both companies burned to the ground I'd have a laugh and go about my day
Both companies have been bought up my soulless entities for the one reason only
=Money  merchandising anything/everything
As Americana as Superman is the S should be a dollar sign same thing with almost every comic book character
None of it's special anymore but, i digress

If you enjoy/love The Avengers: Civil War
God bless you your stronger then me
I can't for the life of me  swallow that pill
This film was only put out and rushed due to  WB/DC having two comic adaptions out this summer
Marvel wasn't  the pretty girl at the dance for once
So they took a brilliant story and rushed it to have a Marvel property out when DC had two films for the summer of 2016
This film is Marvel stroking there ego (laughing at the suckers i mean moviegoers
Cause God forbid anyone call out Marvel/Disney for putting out a cheap mess
I'm not trolling i seen this film last Thurs. it's all smoke,mirrors and hype
 They took a solid deep social commentary story and watered it down and just put it out there to draw money!
""A movie has things that move and a book has the freedom where it doesn't have to be in constant motion like that""
In a movie if it doesn't move then it doesn't play....................

Why this film is hype?
The story is so nonsensical and it's bloated no film should run 2.5 hrs.
This ain't Citizen Kane it's a dumb comic book movie
The story drags on and on
Anyone who hates on Batman visits Superman but, loves this are complete hypocrites
Both films are one and the same Both films have the same plot
both films have terrible ""so-called"" Super villains
Both films were made just to be big budget summer blockbusters with no real substance
All the critics going on and on about how this is the best Marvel film of all time
Seriously??? How much were they payed under the table to hype this film
This is far from the best Marvel film it's barely average
Half the cast shouldn't even be in this film
You get the debut in the MCU of Chadwick Boseman playing Wolverine i mean Black Panther
way to go Marvel/Disney  instead of making nice with 20th Century FOX  and get key members of both the Fantastic Four and X-Men
We get a lame 1970's C List Super Hero in Black Panther (It's funny they did there best for him to be like Wolverine) Epic Fail and cheap
Speaking of cheap Tom Holland doing the V/O of a completely CGI Spider man that looks terrible
What did they do take footage from a Spider man video game and just add that
This film also remind me how much i hate Spider Man  (And i find it strange none of the people praising this film have sad anything negative about the cheap look of Spider man he was put in this film last minute the look is prof of that along with a few times his British Accent came through while reading his lines (Great V/O director)  This is HQ???
Zemo is worse then Luther in Batman/Superman

Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man annoying it's never once explained why he would take the side of the Government
since Tony Stark is meant to be the rebel why would he fall in line to the man?
I miss the drug addict Robert Downey Jr. that was a fun daring actor now he's just there going through the motions
You can tell he only took this role to get a paycheck

That epic battle at the airport is far from epic it's cheap and means nothing due to the fact the story is so convoluted and lost in itself
The epic battle is very much like this film as a whole anti-climatic
But, at least there's no shameless product placement besides the cars and Spider Man talking about Star Wars another property owned by Disney

What's good very little
Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen)  is much better in this then she was in Age of Ultron
 Captain America is good even though it's not his flick (Chris Evans tries he's best)
 Bucky Barnes who looks very much like Nomad from the 90's minus the shotgun, sunglasses  and baby strapped to his back)
Not sure if he's meant to be Nomad Sebastian Stan doesn't look anything like Bucky that's for sure
Paul Rudd as  Ant-Man was also another highlight (maybe has 8 minutes of screen time)
Frank Grillo makes a short cameo as Crossbones and they kill him off
a cool looking Super Villain they kill but Zemo is the white whale this makes no sense
I think i hated this film more then Batman/Superman
 how can you mess up the Civil War plot line? rush it and throw everything at the wall and see what sticks and pay a number  of critics to hype and praise how it's amazing the film is
2.5 hrs I'll never get back
At some point Comic book adaptations are gonna get tired and old and stop being put out every year
Avengers: Age of Ultron and Civil War are prof that Marvel/Disney are already running out of steam 4.5/10
I don't expect this review to get any helpful thumbs up",1463443200,5,5741,4.340802987861811
7706603,3,B01D9EUNBY,"This movie doesn't make sense to me. I wanted to love it. I wanted to like it. But, Captain America should be a better leader than this. Why is he so quick to ""it's the highway or my way"". I won't give anything away but I mean come on, Captain, why aren't you as good as Superman? Superman was someone who inspired people to be better in BvS. I was hoping that Captain America would lead rather than divide. He didn't .

In the end, the reason this gets three stars is because RDJ was awesome. I mean come on. The guy can act and he really shows it here. Spider-Man! Black Panther! I hope he will lead theAvengers in the future, because Captain America is a horrible leader. Really, every character besides Vision and Captain America made this a movie worth watching. Actually, I don't ever want to see Captain America in his own movie again. Iron Man 3 was a perfect movie for that character. This movie made me kind of hate Captain America.",1463356800,5,942,4.3522727272727275

7706605,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I went to see Captain America: Civil War this weekend. And Id have to say its the best Marvel Studios film to date. Captain America: Civil War brings a Marvel comic to life in an action packed film that does not disappoint. Just like a great oldschool comic, Captain America Civil War leaves the viewer counting down the days anticipating the next film.

Watching Captain America: Civil War its clear to me that Marvel Studios learned their lessons from the clunky and uneven Avengers: Age of Ultron. Cinematically Captain America Civil War has a slower pace, tighter story, easier to follow visual effects and much better character development. Instead of trying to cram 200 issues of comics into one film, Marvel Studios tells one story set in a cinematic universe of superheroes. This storytelling approach makes the film easier to watch and a much more enjoyable movie experience.

What did I love about this film? The fact that Marvel studios wasn't afraid to take risks. Instead of adapting the dreary, depressing and divisive Civil War story from the Marvel Comics, Marvel Studios decides go in a different direction for its cinematic universe. While the story crafted for the screen was original it captured the spirit of Classic Marvel comics from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and made it fresh for 21st Century viewers. Because Captain America Civil War is NOT an adaptation of a comic, it tells fresh exciting story filled with twists turns and surprises. Just when you think you have this movie figured out, itll throw you a curveball.

I really liked the story in this film, it evoked memories of 2004s The Incredibles. Just like that film, mankind fears the violence and destruction that The Avengers participate in when they stop the bad guys. So they propose the Slovenia Accords to control The Avengers. Tony wracked with guilt from the creation of Ultron is for it, While Captain America is against it. The conflict is about the ideals and values of superheroes until it gets personal for both Tony and Cap.

However, what makes Captain America: Civil War compelling is the fact that its humans not superhumans that are the greatest danger to the Marvel Cinematic Earth. Like Syndrome in The Incredibles, Men like Tony Stark, Thunderbolt Ross and Helmut Zemo show us that but ordinary people who lose control of themselves are more dangerous than any super villian. And in their quest to try to get control over situations beyond their control they wind up crossing moral and ethical lines without regard to the cost of the lives and livelihoods of others. And the damage they do to intangibles like trust and integrity actually do more damage to society than all the death and destruction they do in any of the epic battles in Civil War.

Itll be interesting to see how all of this is reconciled over the next few Marvel Studios movies. Does Tony work towards reclaiming the trust of his friends? Or does he keep making compromises to his core values that send him into a bottle? Im thinking Infinity War makes the world realize how much worse things can be without the Avengers there to protect them.

Another thing I liked about this film is how humanized the characters are. Theres a lot of subtlety and nuance to the characters in this story and a lot of depth and dimension on them. No one is perfect in this story, and no one makes easy decisions. Viewers really see how tough it is to be a superhero and the how they have to deal with the consequences of their actions. In this story you come to understand sometimes doing the right thing doesnt end up with a happily ever after like in the comic books, but a hero has to do whats right because its the right thing to do. No major characters die, but you truly see the human cost of the war between both sides in this story.

The writing on this film is rock solid and the characterizations spot on. All the old characters act just like their comic book counterparts, but the new ones stand out prominently. Black Panther is a BOSS onscreen. His adapted origin is changed quite a bit, but when hes onscreen he commands the screen. Chadwick Boseman disappears into the character and brings him to life with regalness, nobility and intelligence. If theres a Black Panther Movie coming, Ill be first in line to see it. Boseman will carry that one to number one at the box office easily.

Spider-Mans story is different too, but still great. Even though Aunt May is now a MILF, this is the best adaptation of Spider-Man to ever come to film. This is the awkward, geeky kid we all grew up reading in the comics struggling to find out what kind of hero he wants to be. Spidey steals almost every scene hes in. I love the fact that hes a great contrast to the more seasoned and experienced heroes and in awe of them. I cant wait to see more of him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The fight scenes are absolutely spectacular in this film. The battles are big and look and feel like a comic book come to life. The scenes of Cap fighting Crossbones in the inciting incident looked like they were was ripped from a 1989 Mark Gruenwald Keiron Dwyer comic. And a scene of Cap and the Falcon in the bar looked like a panel taken from a 1970s comic. Theres a scene of Iron Man firing repulsors at Cap holding his shield taken straight from a cover of Civil War comics, and the battle at the airport evokes the big rubble filled battles John Byrne and George Perez used to draw at Marvel. I never thought wed live in an age where a comic book can come to life, but here we are.

I only have a couple of gripes about this movie The first is that Negro woman who pulled the guilt trip on Tony Stark at MIT. That scene pretty much reinforced a stereotype about fat Black single moms. The fact that she stated she was a government HR worker who came all the way to an MIT use shaming tactics on Tony and emasculate him was a scene that really annoyed me. With all the positive portayals of Black men in this film, this was the one that made me say to myself:

Damn. Just Damn.

 I know Marvel desperately needs diversity in its superhero movies, but did we really need the Skrong Independent Black woman coming into a movie and using the superpower of her big mouth? That scene needed to be rewritten or just cut out of the movie altogether. Id rather have a scene of pre Spectrum Monica Rambeau talking to Stark than the mammy they stuck in that scene.

The second gripe is about the inconsistently invincible Iron Man. In the Avengers: Iron Man Mark 6 can take on Thor and Captain America in a fight, and in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Hulkbuster is shown beating up the Hulk, but Mark 46 which is more advanced than both the Mark 44 and Mark 6 is getting wrecked beyond repair by the far less powerful Captain America and Winter Soldier in the final battle. Seriously, Stark needs to get on his quality control. Right now the older Mark 6 looks stronger than ANY of his more advanced upgrade suits onscreen.

The final gripe is the handling of Zemo. Yeah, The Russos were trying to show that a mere man was able to manipulate superheroes like puppets on a string and get them to fight each other. And that he was a villain that used a more subtle psychological approach to achieve his means. But his story kind of got lost because he was so behind the scenes. I get the fact that his subtlety was a contrast to all the dynamic superheroes onscreen, but Id like to see a villain Id love to hate in a Marvel Studios movie again. The last great villain who had a good time while he was kicking superhero ass was Loki, and that was years ago. Marvel needs another villain we love to hate in their movies and they need him NOW.

Captain America: Civil War is the must see movie of the year. To truly appreciate it you have to go see it on the big screen at your local movie theater. I highly recommend you go out and see this one, you will definitely enjoy it.",1463356800,5,7912,4.491655076495132
7706606,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Went to see this movie last night and I know you have heard it before. But it is easily the best Marvel movie to date. Plenty of action and laughs. To me Black Panther, Spiderman, and Antman took the spotlight. If you are a true comic book nerd, you will watch this movie and buy it on DVD when it comes out.",1463270400,,308,3.9838709677419355
7706607,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I wasn't sure whether to watch the movie or not, but I couldn't help myself and went to see it in 3D in Laser IMAX at the TCL Chinese Theatres in Hollywood. Going into the theatre, I erased my previous knowledge of the Marvel Civil War comic event from my mind, and went in with an open mind. Walking out of the theatre, I can say that as it concerns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this movie gives you a small taste of the craziness and excitement that is to come with the Avengers Infinity War Movies, does a fantastic job introducing the Black Panther, and is a worthy addition to the Capt. America Franchise. I however cannot say that its a perfect movie, or the best Capt. America movie in the franchise.

First off, as a big fan of and reader of various DC and Marvel comics growing up, I still remember how much I enjoyed the Civil War event back in 2006. Just like Kingdom Come for DC, Civil War was a Marvel event where the negative impact of superheros in human society was questioned due to a tragic event. Society had grown to fear superheros that they once cheered for and loved, and this lead to the formation of the Iron Man and Capt. America groups, each group with their own opinion on how to handle the integration of superheros in society moving forward. There was violence, there was bloodshed, there was death, and both groups made decisions that would forever rock the fundamentals of who they are and what made them heros in the first place. Basically, it was heavy. And where Bucky (Winter Soldier) was the main focus of the movie, Spider-man played a pivotal part of the comic series.

Having said all this, the movie was not as packed or heavy as the comic, which will disappoint that was your expectation. If anything, the events that transpired in the movie led more to a sort of Civil Battle than a War, and whereas the final events of the comic made it seem that the avengers, X-man, Fantastic 4, and others would never be the same, the movie left our cinematic heros in a position that sets up the future Avenger movies (for the most part).

I assumed before watching the movie that there was no way that the movie could pack everything the comic did, and I understand that unlike other book to movie franchises, Marvel has to deal with the contracts and ages of the actors they have available (until 2018-2019 anyways), movie licenses that take away being able to use the X-men, fantastic 4, and Spider-man (almost), all while setting up the beginning to the Avengers Infinity War movies. In that regard, I felt that Civil War was exactly what the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) needed to get from point A to point B, and used just enough material to be able to justify the Civil War part of the title. Keeping all this in mind, I only judged and compared Civil War to previous Marvel movies in the MCU.

Having watched the movie, I can say I liked many aspects of the movie, and some aspects that could have been improved.
WHAT I LIKED:

FIGHT SCENES- After watching Batman Vs. Superman, which disappointed in terms of fight scenes, I wondered how Marvel would handle the action in this movie especially when all the characters fight at once. I not only enjoyed the fight scenes in the movie, I felt that Marvel did a good job at showcasing each characters strengths and attributes during those fights. From the Intro scene, to the introduction of Black Panther, the Airport scene, and finale, the action in this movie was well-paced and spread out well. And when all the characters did show up in the movie to fight, unlike Batman vs. Superman (Batman/Wonder-woman), each character in this movie has been introduced previously, and youve come to understand what they represent and who they are. Since the focus of most of the movie was on Capt. America, Bucky, Black Panther, Iron Man, and the Falcon, the short airport scene involving everyone was enjoyable but not overwhelming, and left you wanting more. Each characters traits, sense of humor, fighting styles came through, and the action meshed well.

SPIDER-MAN- His inclusion was a major announcement and exciting months ago, and it was great to see Marvels Spider-man in the MCU. I of course would have liked to see spider-man play a pivotal role as the comic, but Marvel wasn't sure if he was going to be in the movie in the first place since Sony holds the Movie rights. But he did, and though short, Im glad hes in it at all.

3) BLACK PANTHER- More than Spider-man who has already had his opportunity on the big screen, the Black Panther was just another example of Marvel understanding a character and casting them well. I also loved how the cultural aspect of his character was an important part of him in the movie, which just made him all the more believable and an instant favorite. Knowing that Ryan Coogler (Director of Fruitville Station, Creed) is on board for the Black Panther movie is exciting, but it was also great to find out that he had a part in how some scenes played out in this movie.

WHAT I DIDNT LIKE

STORYLINE- I knew that the comic version of Civil War would not translate to the movie version, and I was right. But that wasn't the problem. In terms of other MCU or Capt. America movies, Captain America Winter Soldier was a more complete Marvel movie, and held by many as the best Marvel Movie for good reason. What was missing from Civil War is that the storyline and villain that Marvel did go along with was not as well planned out or as important to the overall picture of the Marvel Cinematic universe as other movies or Winter Soldier. Without giving away spoilers, the ending and twist in the movie have no real consequence in the MCU, and one could argue that you're pretty much in the same position at the end of the movie as you were in the beginning. All this is besides the comparison of the comic to the movie, which would be endless.

Having watched the movie in theaters, I can say Im glad I did, and will be buying the Blu-ray once released. Marvel continues to do Justice to these characters, and its exciting whats to come in the near future with the Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. Personally, I feel that the movie for me was 4.5 stars, definitely better than other reviews Ive read, and better than Batman Vs. Superman. This movie did not disappoint, and was a worthy addition to both the MCU and Capt. America Franchise.",1463270400,,6384,4.553135888501743
7706608,3,B01D9EUNBY,"I have no loyalty to anything other than to a high standard, and what I want out of a film, I have seen everything from DC and Marvel starting with Batman in 1989. Spoilers below..

After seeing Iron Man V Captain America: Dawn of Avenging (Civil War) I'm probably one of the few who not only appreciates but prefers the Batman V Superman film over the latest blatantly similarly themed Marvel hero VS hero film. It's not the first time critics have been wrong, or that fans emulated the responses of their beloved critics but it has revealed to me much insight into why they seem to sit on such opposite ends of the spectrum.

I really wanted to like this film more than I did. First having seen Batman V Superman, and then as well as judging it upon its own merit Marvel's entry is everything you would expect (minus maybe Giant Man if you didn't see a trailer with that part in it at the time.) Its straightforward, vanilla, and palatable to general audiences. It reinforces liberal and conservative binary political stereotypes, as well as sanctioning the idea of submission to authoritarian government control. Visually it fits right in with the MCU and the rest of their almost completely forgettable scores.

Nothing sums it up more than when Cap says ""If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose""....""We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own"" never mind that whole ""no you move"" eulogy speech. However, half The Avengers sign themselves away with the Sokovia Accords without skipping a beat, without question, without even genuine honest discussion among themselves, and rebellious Tony Stark is immediately on board, all because he is guilt tripped by one mother? No one ever speaks up and says ""Hey how many more lives would have been lost if we hadn't intervened in NY, Sokovia(Stark's mess), and of course Nigeria?"" Don't the Avengers exist to specifically bypass the limitations of governments to take care of threats they can't handle on their own? YES!! But no one mentions that, at all.

Further displaying their wonderfully efficient 'team' dynamic everyone takes their side on the issue after a brief exchange of disagreements and goes off to do their own thing, eventually needing to recruit more people to fight their personal battle for them including a teenage Spider-man, a cool call for movie-goers to enjoy, but arguably another irresponsible call for Stark. What is even more ridiculous is that after realizing he was wrong about Bucky's involvement which sparked the whole thing, Tony still just takes all his pent up anger about his parent's death out on Captain America and Bucky, unrelentingly playing the part Zemo had set up for him, even after being made aware of it. In that case, maybe I do understand why Tony Stark is so willing to submit to control, after poor judgment calls like Ultron and his fit of rage he is more of a loose cannon than anyone else on the team, maybe even the absent Hulk.

How could anyone trust these 100+ countries and their corrupt governments to properly manage and use the Avengers as their will? That's how another Vietnam or Afghanistan or Gaza strip, but worse, begins. How can anyone defend submission to government control in the U.S.(because they know what's best for us?)when the whole country is founded on the idea of choice, and rebellion against an oppressive government? So because a small percentage of the general public and governments especially, fear the power these individuals have they have to respond with their own flex of power? Yes of course there are going to be casualties, whether it be war, any kind of conflict or life in general. I personally would feel safer with the Avengers out there combating villains saving everyone they can, while still in full control and able to put governments in check when they too get out of line.

DC's approach in BvS (without going into too much detail here) is darker, more symbolic and psychological, scratching at the surface, with an emphasis upon questioning ourselves, our beliefs, our perspective, our reality, with great analogical religious parallels. It is visually more arresting, and with a memorable score that enhances the on screen drama.

I know this is sensationalized reality like any comic book story but while Civil War feeds us another easily digestible dose of colorful, one-liners, and fun packaged in what we've all come to expect from Marvel films, which is good. The other challenges established norms, and further invites us to delve into humanities dark psyche, which is better. Personally I will always prefer and find art more relevant when it challenges established thinking and power structures, versus those that mirror or reinforce them.""It doesn't matter what the press says...or the mob says. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right.""",1463270400,17,4870,4.917274939172749
7706609,5,B01D9EUNBY,"Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) divide over the issue of UN oversight, and then Caps protection of the international fugitive the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) puts two teams of superheroes on a collision course.

Boy, do I love these MCU movies in a completely uncritical way.  They came along at just the right time to allow me to relive my joy of reading Marvel Comics as a boy.  Despite the huge amount of goodwill I bring to the show, I think this movie is undeniably a success for anyone who is not just fundamentally uninterested in this type of story.  Marvel has familiarized moviegoers with their style of storytelling to the point that the Russo brothers and their screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) can feature a vast supporting cast of super-powered characters while still keeping an intimate focus on the journey of Steve, Tony, and Bucky.  Cant wait to see what these guys do with Infinity War.  Looking forward to Black Panther and Spider-Man upcoming solo projects.",1463184000,6,1036,4.959537572254336
7706610,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I had a few different titles I wanted to use for this, but went with the simple one. Others were ""A movie that somehow manages to not only outdo WInter Soldier, but pretty much any super hero film with a large number of them in one film."" The third was ""A movie that is called Captain America that gives Tony Stark more plot development than he's ever gotten."" And they are all right, in my opinion.

Where to start. Don't be going into this looking for some super creepy, weird, ""villain."" Yes, this movie has enemies, and the title ""civil war"" yes means other superheroes too, but there are others. Let's start with the return for General Thunderbolt Ross. He is played really well, still really simply put, about as much of a villain while still being on the side as it gets. Showing unnecessary creepy footage to basically make the good guys feel bad. We also have a surviving now full-fledged villain who is only in the opening scene, which sets 1 of 2 needed stages of the film. The main one is someone whose motive is literally unclear til the very end of the film. You will not expect it, no matter how other things you might figure out or find obvious.

Onto this film, after a opening fight scene, now ""Avenger"" Scarlet Witch, is the first to be distraught. Vision is also around, so yeah, you definitely had to see ""Age Of Ultron"" to get everything. Even if your watching a movie that is about 1000x what ""Age Of Ultron"" could really dream to be, ""Civil War"" sets up a 117 country act that will basically make the avengers a world owned, controlled organization. In a turn of events, Tony Stark actually is on board. Why? Because he seems to finally be feeling guilty for the chaos he's caused, namely creating Ultron, which, was pretty dumb on his part. Side scenes emphasize this. Others have different ideas, Captain America the freedom fighter wants the freedom. Cue a disastrous thing to make things worse when formed evil ""Winter Soldier"" Bucky Barnes seems to have blown up an embassy, killing what turns out to be the Black Panther's dad.

And that's when it really gets insane. The introduction of the Black Panther was great-acting, movements, reasons, etc. For being a side character, he goes through an entire character arc and realization by the end. After a semi-fight, everyone is brought in, and our villain ""Zemo"" uses specific words to set up the winter soldier Bucky. I kind of expected something like this was going to be an issue, but all of the surrounding issues just makes it so much worse. What follows, is teaming up, including Spider-Man, which, I honestly loved. He's in the MCU now, he's got the signal, he's younger, he's still wise cracking like ASM2, but different enough. A humorous kidnapping of Ant-Man leads to the big ""showdown. Or so you'll think. Sorry if I don't have the sides entirely right, but we got: Iron Man, Black Panther, Black Widow, War Machine, Vision, and Spider man. Versus Captain America, Falcon, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Winter Soldier, and Scarlet Witch.

Both dark and humorous, from Ant-Man going into a new mode, to Spider Man being in apparently his first real fight, to the accidental hurting of War Machine, and who does it as well, coupled with double-double-double agent Black Widow's actions. As said, this film has many surprises even when you think you've figured out 1/2 the twists. No, the real battle is still yet to be fought, but it was pretty epic. Honestly, nothing can really compare. It's basically the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor scene from Avengers times 1000.

There is an issue with their being more hydra winter soldiers (are you suprised or not? not sure if I was.). But this is not at all how this film will end. They show scenes of a car and hints all throughout that it was (MEGA SPOILER ALERT!) Tony's parents car. Who else has been waiting since like, Iron Man 2 to find out who did it and why? Captain America's darkest moment comes out. Tony Stark tried so hard to not act like a fool or pursue his own agenda, but no one can blame him for the massive battle that occurs. It's almost more epic than the big fight earlier on. No one really knows how to apologize, but everyone really does in some way or another.

Now that I'm past the film itself, what's the damage? Well, for one, I was pretty worried the movie would be heavily overcrowded. I wasn't feeling them throwing Iron Man so heavily into the film. ""Winter Soldier"" had Black Widow, Captain America, Nick Fury, Winter Soldier, Frank Grillo/Crossbones, Robert Redford, that's about it. Avengers Age Of Ultron felt extremely overcrowded, Baron Von Struckner appearing for no real reason other than to throw in Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, they basically just fight giant robots again. Yeah, wasn't a big fan of the later.
This film does not suffer from the ""too many characters"" effect at all. One can say ""spider man was unnecessary"" despite how well it worked, but aside from that, I see this film only as ""it would be less if it lacked anything else."" Another thing, is a movie needing to be a ""civil war"" I would've thought needed to be a 2 parter, but truthfully, unless they were going to drag like 5 more heroes into this and change the ending to the cliche plot we thought was coming but didn't, it would've felt dragged out then. Another thing before being done is, anyone comparing this to BatmanVSuperman should just stop. This movie nor that movie would have any right to be anything like each other. Just because they set up versus circumstances means literally nothing. ""omg superheroes fight"" is the end of similarities. They are such different characters in different universes in totally different levels of events occurring. I am glad to see Hollywood didn't toss 2 versus films similar, contrary to what others say.

In conclusion, whether you simply love Marvel, love Captain America, Iron Man, any of the others (honestly cannot wait for Black Panther after this), you want to see this. It has a way better plot, pacing, etc, than ""Age Of Ultron"" and doesn't play around. A sense of humor? Yes. Is it a goofball fest like Iron Man 3 with nonsensical plot points, or redundant and not in need of any team like Age Of Ultron? Absolutely not. The directors for this movie are doing Avengers: Infinity Wars 1-2, and this film proved they have the rights to do so.",1463184000,4,6343,4.652988403211419
7706621,4,B01D9EUNBY,"Though not suitable for younger viewers (see ""NEGATIVES"" section below for more details), Captain America: Civil War is, for the most part, *really* good.  This is the movie that Avengers: Age of Ultron (AOU) should have been, but sadly wasn't (not even close).  And if the kid inside you has ever longed to see a ""battle of superheroes"" movie done well (and what guy hasn't?!), THIS is definitely the one to see (forget Batman vs. Superman).

POSITIVES

Every character in the film is portrayed almost to perfection.  Evans and Downey shine, as always (they clearly ""own"" these roles at this point in the game).  Actually, I can't think of an actor who did not give a fine performance in this, including those with lesser roles.  Chadwick Boseman, in specific, nailed the part (and accent!) of T'Challa/Black Panther -- a character I have long wanted to see on the big screen.  The suit and mask exceeded all expectations, to boot!  Now I'm really looking forward to his solo movie (which unfortunately has been delayed until 2018).  In addition, Sebastian Stan is even more impressive as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier in this sequel.  I was also struck by how much better the Vision is depicted in this movie than he was in AOU.  His role in Civil War is definitely more significant, and his abilities (perhaps the coolest of any Avenger) and personality are fleshed out more and utilized to greater effect.  And while I am not fond of his first solo movie (it deviated considerably and needlessly from the character's ""canonical"" origins and was, well, goofy), Ant Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is genuinely and appropriately funny in this story and proves to be, much to *my* surprise, a valuable ally to Captain America's team.

The action in Civil War will be very hard to surpass by any filmmaker in Hollywood, but it may also be excessive (my eyes/head were left spinning on several occasions, primarily due to the ""shaky"" camera work in several scenes).  As for the screenplay/plot, to keep this review spoiler-free, I will just say that the story was thoughtfully structured to make the personalities within the story and the viewer divided on both moral and emotional levels.  In short, it will challenge you to think more than you would with a typical action/adventure ""popcorn flick.""  Every ""good guy"" in the narrative seems to have a noble and defensible motive for choosing the side that he/she ultimately chooses (it's not easy to say who is ""wrong""), so you will likely find yourself agreeing with both Rogers (Cap) and Stark (Iron Man) in certain places.  (Stark wrestles intensely with his conscience in this one, and it's not only convincing but also refreshing to see, given his largely egocentric, reckless past.)  Moreover, the film serves as a compelling argument against vengeance and vigilantism.  It also highlights the importance of both liberty and law, as well as societies' need to uphold and balance the two, however challenging that might prove to be.

Having witnessed the personal betrayal and widespread catastrophe resulting from governmental abuse and overreach during the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (the previous film in the series), Cap has, understandably, developed a cynical view of governing agencies and has grown to value self-government & individual responsibility more than ever before (""We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are our own"").  Meanwhile, Iron Man has become convinced that the Avengers *must* be held accountable as a group to higher authorities (the United Nations, to be exact) for the civilian casualties they've inadvertently caused and that if they aren't willing to submit to such oversight, then they are ""no better than the bad guys.""  These competing philosophies, both of which have valid points, form the central conflict of Civil War.

Personally, I like both of these characters.  Iron Man was my favorite comic book personality when I was a child, but that's only because I loved his armored suit and thought he had the baddest-looking helmet ever.  As an adult, I am more interested in the ethics and overall worldview (i.e., belief system) of the individuals behind the cool masks and costumes; and Steve Rogers -- long regarded as the ""moral center"" of the Marvel Universe -- is, frankly, a better man than Tony Stark.  That is why I was ""Team Cap"" going into the movie, and why I remain Team Cap after leaving the theater.  The guy's integrity, convictions, spirit, and moral courage are unshakable and indomitable.  Plus, he kicks tail; but *only* if he believes he has a *just* cause for doing so.  Thus, its nearly impossible not to root for the man in any fight.

However, this is not to say that the Sentinel of Liberty's deeply held principles go untested or completely unscathed in Civil War  far from it.  In fact, Rogers must decide how far he is willing to go and how much he is willing to give up to protect and vindicate his closest childhood friend.  But please don't take that to mean that Captain America goes rogue in this movie -- not in the least!  After all the dust settles and the smoke clears, trust me:  Cap remains Cap with his integrity intact. :-)

NEGATIVES

With all that said, I am disappointed to say that, like AOU, Civil War contains some gratuitous profanity (i.e., it serves zero purpose and only distracts & detracts from an otherwise good and entertaining story), and this includes at least three cringe-worthy abuses of God's name.  Frustratingly, the bad language comes almost exclusively from the HEROES in the film (this is, after all, primarily a clash between divided protagonists).  Cap, however, stays true to character (this time!) and keeps it clean, thankfully.

Not surprisingly, the film also features a few violent deaths; but nothing really gory or exploitative, in my opinion. Because of these two objections, I cannot in good conscience recommend Civil War for children, regrettably, unless and until the pointless language is dubbed over and some of the violence is toned down for television broadcast.  As of late, Marvel has been pushing the proverbial envelope with their MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies by turning up the violence and fouling up the language.  This is a rather troubling trend, too, primarily because children gravitate to these kinds of films, not to mention the inevitable plethora of toys and games they spawn.  The simple reality is, kids love superheroes -- they always have and always will.  Filmmakers and movie studios are well aware of this fact, but they seem to have forgotten that they also bear moral/social responsibility for the products they create and sell.  We, the consumers, need to remind them of this truth and hold them accountable.  Someone's got to look out for the little ones.  (You know Cap would!)  ;-)

There are also a few minor quibbles I could go into, (e.g., the casting/script decisions concerning a couple of ""new"" characters are questionable -- namely, I think Spider-Boy, er, -Man ought to be a grown adult at this point instead of a high schooler who looks 12, and the new Aunt May is, disturbingly, young *and* attractive when she ought to be a senior citizen; there is perhaps a little TOO much humor given the gravity of the story line -- the jokes are funny, yes, but they're incongruous at times; there is yet another forced/rushed/unnecessary romance -- though not as unexpected & downright weird as the Hulk & Widow pairing in AOU; and, finally, some changes veer too far away from the source material for my tastes), but elaborating on those trivial points would put me in spoiler territory.

Overall, this is one of the more satisfying comic-based movies ever made.  If the undying friendship/brotherhood of Cap & Bucky is the heart of the film, then the tension between Rogers & Stark is the dramatic core.  And the 17-minute airport fight sequence between the two Avengers factions is the Show Stealer (although, the final fight is just about as good, if not better, due to the emotions invested in it).

And THAT is all I will say! :-D",1463184000,,8069,4.9158671586715865

I love this movie. it's the best captain America movie yet. they just get better and better. true that it does no follow the graphic novel. but it was still amazing. and I love freakin spider-man he was awesome. the actor who plays him is going to be a good spider-man. and the guy who plays black panther was awesome too. and you get to see ant-man go giant man awesome. love this movie and for those of you who have not seen the movie and think that crossbones is the main villain he is not there is a secret villain in the movie and hopefully the nerd in you can figure who it is. great movie love it I will have to say one thing I'm on both sides I agree with captain America and Iron Man. the story is good, the acting is great and the action is awesome. the fight between the heroes is more comical than anything. but don't worry you're nerdy little head a serious fight breaks out toward the end. make sure you stay after the credits. it's a marvel movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1463097600,2,1041,4.1330049261083746
7706623,4,B01D9EUNBY,"Let me begin by saying that I went into this movie initially thinking I wouldnt care for it. For various reasons, I never liked the Civil War storyline from the comics, but it basically boiled down to the fact that I tend to hate seeing my favorite superheroes fighting each other (in the I hate your guts way, not the this is just a misunderstanding way). But in order to keep up on the overarching plotline for the MCU, I knew I pretty much had no choice but to see it. (One of the few faults of the Marvel seriesif you miss even one movie, youll have no clue whats going on.) So I plopped myself down, expecting the worst.

In the end, Im torn. This movie is a vast improvement over the previous Avengers film, and IS greatly entertaining in many placesbut also because of it, the MCU is definitely not the happy, hopeful, and fun universe it used to be anymore.

As the roster of superheroes continues to expand and evolve, more and more of the world begins to question whether the Avengers are really doing that much good, or are they just making things worse, as evidenced by the thousands of deaths caused by the climatic battles in The Avengers, The Winter Solider, and Age of Ultron. Because of this, different countries of the world decide that if the Avengers wish to continue their vigilantism, theyll have to be put under supervision, and sign an act mandating that the government will monitor and approve of their missions. Feeling guilty over the trouble hes personally caused, Tony Stark approves of the new law, and he, along with Black Widow, War Machine, and Vision sign the billnow pitting them against Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Antman, Falcon, and Captain America, who sees the bill as taking away their freedom to do whats truly right. His efforts are also to mainly protect his old friend, Bucky, whos now being hunted down for his murderous actions as The Winter Soldier (despite having been brainwashed and done so against his will). Along with two newcomersthe wisecracking Spider-Man, and the mysterious Black Panther, will our heroes find some way to compromise? Or will they forever be torn apart?

Ill start by saying that I thought Age of Ultron was a bit of a cluttered mess. There WERE some great moments to be had in it, but between the half-baked romance between Bruce and Natasha that did nothing and went nowhere, and the dozens of subplots that didn't get enough attention, it wound up being a bit of a chore to follow. So I was relieved to find that this time around, the plot was far easier to understand. And while the films story is only very loosely based off the comics, for me, I thought it was for the better. Everyones motivations and reasons for why they choose the side they do makes sense, leading into, what has to be, the most entertaining battle in the MCU so far.

And I don't think Im spoiling anything by saying that yes, Spider-Man makes his MCU debut appearance here.  Thankfully, they don't saddle us with a backstory (its only glossed over in a sentence or two), and while his recruitment onto Tonys team is admittedly a bit too quick, both he and Antman practically steal the movie in a BIG way (of which I dare not spoil). As for Black Panther, despite being a newcomer, his background is immediately interesting, and even he goes through a bit of a character arcstarting out being consumed by revenge, but gradually learning to let go of his hate, especially when it comes to light that theres a much more sinister villain behind the scenes pulling the strings and tearing the Avengers Family apart.

Which leads into just how heart-wrenching the plot can get at times. While theres still plenty of funny moments too (as the MCU tends to have), this film pulls no punches in emphasizing just how much collateral damage our heroes actually cause, and that their battles from past movies DO have serious consequences. And no matter which side of the debate that you support, neither team is shown to be absolutely right or wrong in their choices. While we do gain a few new characters, many other ones are either lost or absent. By movies end, lines have been drawn in the sand; long buried secrets are exposed, and close friendships are either tainted or severed. But one thing IS certainnothing in the MCU will ever be the same again.

So while the first Avengers movie will still remain my favorite in terms of sheer fun, this film is easily superior to Age of Ultron. However, like me, you might wind up leaving the theater more melancholy than excitedhappy for the new characters and plotlines well be getting, but sad for the darker turn the MCU is taking.",1463097600,2,4621,4.621193666260658

Reading the reports of others, I am inclined to see how they would side with Iron man (a.k.a Tony Stark) on the side of government oversight but there are far more complicated undertones at stake.
1. What would happen if the government were to have control of a group of super powered individuals?
Is is not enough to have special forces at their beck and call? Now you would have a group of unstoppable people to carry out your agenda?
And this could lead down some very dark places.
2. The original premise of the graphic novel was based upon the tragedy of the HOLOCAUST...where hundreds of thousands were forced to register under neath Nazi rule. Many of these individuals had NO idea what was really in store for them, they just went along with what they were told without question and look where that ended up in history. Another such injustice was the Japanese encampment at Manzanaar at the hand of the U.S. government...where they were told to obey without question or face punishment.

7706629,4,B01D9EUNBY,"As someone who isn't crazy about superhero movies, I can't help but be impressed by Marvel, and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time. Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film.",1462924800,2,2321,4.608695652173913
7706630,1,B01D9EUNBY,"Civil War does not have the interesting theme or buddy movie vibe that made the Winter Soldier so enjoyable.
It does share the same ""concrete fetish"" as most of the action happens on expressways, runways or concrete buildings.
Very grey stuff.

Cap himself was great and Black Panther made an impressive debut but I didn't enjoy the others as much.
The biggest problem I had was Tony Stark, I felt he was written against character just to fit the plot.
I did not believe that the reckless egomaniac who created Ultron has now become a man who wants to be supervised.
The grieving mother by the elevator, the separation from Pepper Potts or the sad thoughtful stares are not enough to sell it.
The only time Iron Man made sense in this movie was at the end, after making a painful discovery.

Spider-Man is just an add on to this movie, take him out and you still have the same exact story.
He comes out of the blue, somehow Stark guessed who he is and brings him in, the whole thing is awkward.
Spider-Man himself was great in the action scenes but I'm not quite sold on the young actor who portrays him as Peter Parker, maybe the upcoming solo flick will change that.
I do not understand why the Russo Bros. added these black stripes on the Spider-Man costume, they're ugly.
Why mess with a classic design?

Another thing that was not explained was the fact that Captain America knew an important secret regarding Iron Man.
It did not really make sense and made Cap seem slightly creepy for a second.

This film should have been better, the action was terrific but the writing did not always convince.
I get the same impression thinking back on it that I did for Age Of Ultron, some good stuff in a contrived and somewhat messy movie.",1462924800,35,1735,4.498412698412698
7706641,5,B01D9EUNBY,"The Good-  Everything.  The script is tight.  Some great dialogue and the plot unfolds in an exciting way.  Each character is given motivation for doing what they are doing.  The movie also does a nice job of giving the large cast of characters something to do and giving just about everyone 'a moment' in the movie.  The pacing of this film is the same as Winter Soldier, the talking scenes set up the action scenes beautifully.  This movie also does a great job of weaving the other Marvel movies together, introducing new characters, and setting up future movies.  Spidey and Black Panther are standouts here.  The action scenes are even more  elaborate than 'Winter Soldier' which are insane.  The approach of the villain is unique and makes for interesting viewing.  Despite the seriousness of the story, they still find a way to get in a good amount of humor (ant-man, Spidey, and Hawkeye especially).

The Bad-  My only gripe with this movie is where was Spider-man's spidey sense?  He gets blindsided several times which is near impossible as his spidey sense is involuntary and should warn him regardless of what is going on.  Also, if you haven't seen the other Marvel movies you may be a bit fuzzy on some of the backstory (but who are we kidding, we've seen them all).

The Deal-  This has deleted Batman vs. Superman from my mind.  That movie was fun on a base level but dropped the ball in many ways.  It had nowhere near the story, character development and balance of this movie.  DC, THIS is how you set up future movies!!  I was engaged by the plot and had a smile on my face during the excellent action sequences.  Also, Spidey is finally given justice and we are treated to the truest version of Spidey on screen thus far (as a life long spidey fan I was happy about that).  It's also nice to see a progression in these films. The Avengers was sort of a fun-spirited romp, now, we are seeing the complexity of the characters that wasn't there before and deeper stories.  Marvel has this down to a science and this movie proves it (again).",1462924800,7,2058,4.557377049180328

7706644,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I love both Marvel and DC movie companies. I'm not one of those people that say 'this is better because of that' I like mostly all superhero flicks. When Batman V Superman came out, I was half disappointed with it. It was overly dark, dreary, random Lex Luthor side stories and weird dream sequences. The battle between Batman and Superman didn't last too long. (However I recently watched the 3 hour R-rated cut of it and it was a much better film)  In comes Captain America: Civil War.

Civil War was definitely the best Captain America movie in the trilogy. I remember being bored with Captain America: The First Avenger. The action scenes are great and the battle between the heroes is epic. There are so many surprises, that I don't wanna spoil them for you, but trust me when I say all the fight scenes are amazing!

A year after the fight in Sokovia and dealing with Ultron, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff are on their own mission trying to stop a man from stealing a biological weapon. Things get disastrous and everyone blames them. The Avengers are forced to sign a Bill called the 'Sokovia Accords' stating that from now on, the Government will control all the Avengers' actions. Tony Stark agrees with it, and Steve Rogers doesn't. Pretty soon, they are all divided and begin to fight each other (mostly over the Winter Soldier) Team Iron Man or Team Captain America, whose side are you on?

7706646,5,B01D9EUNBY,"My Non-Spoiler Review Captain America: Civil War. It was everything it was cracked up to be, I will definitely be seeing it time and time again  what I loved about it was the same thing that I love about all the MCU films is their sincerity.
The characters are true to their comic book counterparts while the actors bring a newness to them every time and humor is definitely sprinkled about in the appropriate places and most of all it was both a fun film with a lot of heart just as all the Marvel Studios films have been for almost a decade

The story is bittersweet and somewhat sad but the payoff is huge  the Marvel story continues to sweep us into the world they have created starting with Iron Man in 2008
and culminating with Civil War  many things come to a head that have been brewing
since The Avengers like Steve and Tony at odds with their different ideologies and this is as much an Iron Man film as it is a Captain America film and in part an Avengers film and Spider-Man film and Black Panther film as well to a small degree you get somewhat the origins of Spider-Man and Black Panther or at least a set-up for them becoming who they are which I thought was handled smoothly and brilliantly and subtlety and integrated into the film instead of some in-your-face tiresome reboot opening sequence.

The main theme of the film is friendship and friendship and loyalty tested I think anyone who sees Civil War will inevitably compare it to Batman v Superman which plays on some of the same themes of super heroes going out of control and average people paying the price but what BvS lacks under all the superficial coolness and slickness and back and forth bravado is a deep understanding of the true nature of these characters as they have been in the comics for generations and what they mean as symbolic icons in our culture and how they play off of each other while maintaining every ounce of who they have been all this time throughout every medium; comics, novels, TV or film. In many cultures around the world they know who these characters are the MCU takes these characters and holds them not only true to themselves and how weve seen them through the years but also holds them up to each other and up to themselves  in this film Tony Stark and Steve Rogers and the rest of the Avengers look into the mirror and have to face that ultimate question: Who am I and what do I stand for?
Which is a very very powerful thing for these characters that mean so much to us

Civil War gives them a platform for self analysis and therefore an analysis to ourselves  In a way Civil War is a graduation of sorts for Steve, Tony, Natasha, Wanda, the Vision, Bucky, Scott, Sam, James and Clint these characters we have gotten to know over the years and who have each gotten to know each other  Civil War is in a sense about them stop playing at being super heroes and taking responsibility for their actions, for themselves and for each other.
And you feel that wholeheartedly by the films end  they along with us watching their adventures have grown up in a way along with us.
Its very difficult to describe this film without spoiling it  yes the action is great, the dialogue is very good. Spider-Man is well amazing and Black Panther is exactly what he is supposed to be: regal, commanding, proud and wise all at the same time.
Ant-Man is well WOW. You just have to see it, experience it because it IS an experience. An experience that flows smoothly and makes so much sense and has definitely been built up upon film after film of what has come before but as well as being a Spider-Man movie or Black Panther movie or even an Avengers movie at the heart is Iron Man and Captain America. So because of the Winter Soldier this very much the continuation of Caps story which rounds out to a perfect super hero Trilogy which is very very rare indeed; All three Cap films have been excellent and no other super hero Trilogy is as great as this one with a character that deserves it more than most, but this is just as much Iron Man 4 as it is Captain America 3. At least thats how I felt, this is just as much about Tony as it is about Steve.

I will say this, the fight scenes are extraordinary, fun, cool and awesome but then so is the drama and the debates between the characters  this is no slick action, superficial who beats who kind of film like Batman v Superman is. This is no what if scenario.
Is this a better film than BvS? I think so it may be a slower more intentional film nowhere near as stylized or slick-looking but it means more. In that film Superman and Batman didn't know each other, they weren't friends, didn't even like each other. Both films have similar basic themes in a very general way but putting Civil War under the glass and comparing them is like night and day. Because Civil War is ALL about friendship and loyalty and broken ties not just two super heroes going at each other  but a deeper, more personal and painful conflict rather than just some self justification of one character going after another  Civil War gets to the heart of who these characters are and what they are all about.

This is a hard-hitting, gut wrenching achievement where you feel something for these characters and want to see them get beyond their struggles and grow as if they were someone you actually know.
You root for one side or another  but in the end your heart goes out to all of them  doesnt matter if its Team Iron Man or Team Cap because in the end you want to cheer for them as a unit, you want to cheer for The Avengers yet the Avengers are broken and quite possibly no more
Yes there are funny moments and Oh my gosh I cant believe they did that moments but what really tears at the heart and soul is what is ultimately there between Steve and Tony and between Steve and Bucky. Ultimately what suffers in this story is friendship and comradeship and thats a really sad thing but perhaps, maybe, it is not entirely lost I guess well find out in Avengers Infinity War Part 1. And I for one cannot wait to see what happens next with these characters, these friends of ours that we have gotten to know in the last ten years of our own lives",1462752000,,6169,4.363557105492589
7706647,5,B01D9EUNBY,"I've never seen superhero action done so well before, not in either the Marvel or DC Cinematic Universe. We're talking extended scenes of gut clenching action, the kind that are made so well you never get ""used"" to the action, indeed you are continually both amazed and riveted. I don't care which side of the comics universe fence you steadfastly align yourself with (I'm a fan of both Marvel and DC), if you are any kind of superhero fan you owe it to yourself to see this movie as soon as possible.

Okay, the story. This story is more intricate and even more topical than its predecessor, Winter Soldier, and thus not as easily grasped...at this point it bears mentioning that the casual superhero fan is probably going to be a bit mixed up due to both the main and sub plots being somewhat mired in the movies before {most specifically Avengers I and II (Age of Ultron), both earlier Captain America movies, Ant-Man, and from a more peripheral perspective the first and third Iron Mans}. So, if you're a DC only exclusivist you will have ammo for your silly arguments.

One of the main themes contained within Civil War is government intervention (the head) attempting to clamp down on the human heart (independent, emotion-filled heroism). The irony (i.e, one of the factors that made it such a great movie, even without the action) is that Tony found himself possessed by his heart at the end, such was compounded/exacerbated by his bad situation with his soul mate Pepper. So, even though Cap and he were basically friends, even if he finally did understand Bucky's having been manipulated ""Manchurian Candidate"" HAH!). Cap truly did win...Stark learned. You can't stop the heart from feeling.

The introduction of the Spider-man, Giant-man, and Black Panther characters is like a cherry on top (and Tom Holland's Spider-Man seems a huge improvement over the hesitant Garfield, even in this early and brief stage).

My main concern going into this movie was how they could shoot a scene with so much action and so many characters and make it flow well. That is what Marvel absolutely nailed in this movie, and in my opinion, the action in Civil War is unmatched, even by both avenger movies.

7706649,5,B01D9EUNBY,"The Good:
Similar to Captain America 2, within just a few minutes we're thrown into the suspense and action that sets the tone for the film. Almost each character gets their moment to shine in terms of action or just displaying their special abilities. The MANY different fight scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen. There's rarely ever a dull moment and the overall pacing of the film was done very effectively despite being over 2.5 hours long. I think its also safe to say that the airport scene is by far one of the best scenes in the film.

There were so many surprises in this film. Rarely do I get to say this, but the trailers actually didn't give a lot away. The trailers were altered to the point where some things will still look new.

The themes and writing in this movie were carried out in a believable, coherent and authentic way. The motivations of the many characters did not seem forced, in my opinion. This led to some nice plot twists that continue to progress the story. (Though some of those twists were mildly predictable). It's rather difficult to choose a side of one of the characters because the moral lines are so heavily grayed. As a fan of the Civil War comics (great read by the way), I was very appreciative of how Marvel was able to stay true to the nature and feeling of the source material even though they had to change a lot of the details for the sake of the movie. They did a great job of handling issues like the collateral destruction of cities, the loss of life, and the responsibility of great power.

What's even more interesting is how the movie is able to maintain an overall serious tone but still find time to have many humorous moments. It's not a comedy, but it does stay true to that ""Marvel Fun"" that we've come to enjoy.

Lets get into the characters. Its no surprise anymore that Spider-Man is a feature in this film. His scenes are probably one of the biggest highlights in the movie for both his humor and the action he brings to the table. Luckily what you see in the trailers is only a tiny glimpse of whats to come with Spidey.

Zemo (played by, Daniel Brhl) made for a good villain in this story. It was interesting to see how his motivations drove his actions. Similar to how Tom Hiddlestons Lokis character was developed, we are given a bit more complex villain with Zemos character.

Black Panther....YES! He was AWESOME. Yes Im biased because hes like the first black superhero (And because you knowIm black) I was so happy and proud to see Chadwick Boseman bring this character to life. From his African accent, presence of royalty, all the way down to his proficient cat-like ninja fighting style, he truly embodied what the Black Panther character always intended. (That is to have a sense of pride in African culture) His role in the film has definitely made me more optimistic about the upcoming solo film.

I was impressed with how this film was able to juggle so much at once. With this huge cast of characters, it rarely felt as though any one of them suffered from a lack of screen time. Not only that but Civil War also managed to still serve as a platform for the upcoming solo movies.

The Bad:
What?! Theres some bad? I know I was shocked too, but bear with me. Theres are two issues I had problems with, but they're kind of spoilery so I won't list them here. If you're really interested, just visit my youtube channel youtube.com/c/EmansMovieReviews and you can see the two things i had an issue with.

The Reason:
I think its safe to say that Marvel has done it again. Civil War had a lot of expectations and I think it delivered on most of them. I know a lot of people really want to compare this to Batman V Superman because the movies share practically the same themes. I think that while this may feel like a natural comparison to make, it may be a little unfair to do so. Batman V Superman had a completely different motive and intent behind it. It was a setup movie for all of the other movies DC wants to kick off. (Not to mention they had to play catch up in the comic book movie realm) Civil War was a solo movie for Captain America that just so happened to set up other movies and continue the overall story arc of the Marvel cinematic universe.

So I think a much better comparison for Civil War would be to its predecessor, Captain America 2: Winter Soldier. Avengers: Age of Ultron was best compared to Avengers 1 because it was the same director trying to do better than before. Avengers 2, unfortunately, disappointed because it was really more of the same without very many new aspects to elevate the movie. All we got were the superhero team-up moves and three minor characters.  (Well2 other characters that lived.) :-/

If I had to compare the two, Id probably say that Civil War comes in slightly lower than Winter Soldier. Winter Soldier gets the edge for its originality. It was the first time we saw an espionage film that just so happened to have super heroes in it. It was the first time we saw super heroes cross into a different movie genre, thus making it rather hard to top. There was no way for Civil War to be any more original than Cap 2, in my opinion. Civil War does give us more of the same compared to Cap 2, except it does two things uniquely different. Were given two new major characters in Spider-Man and Black Panther, and it accomplished the seemingly difficult task of juggling many characters at once. The movie was about 55% Captain Americas story 25% setup for new characters and 20% everyone else.

Overall, Civil War was a very good movie. There are also two end credit scenes, so be on the lookout. Id say Civil War is a must see in any format.

Captain America: Civil War includes most of the Avengers (if not all, I don't really remember) and is good in many ways. It rivets your eyes to the screen with the intensity of the battles and interesting plot line.
Just saying, there's lots of humorous scenes and I won't ruin them for you all :)
The reason that I didn't rate this 5 stars is because it just didn't have the feel of the Avengers movies, whereas it brings most/all of them into this movie. I don't know how exactly to explain it, but The Avengers: Age of Ultron and The Avengers just left me with a better impression (by a little).",1462579200,,691,4.323076923076923

Taking its cues from the popular comic book angle, Captain America Civil War brings to fold the epic storyline of the Avengers divided on the moral questions of their phenomenal powers and skills used independently or on the orders of a global authority. Steve Rogers is against this whereas Tony Stark is for it. Almost from the beginning its clear both men have noble reasons for what they believe and its amazing how well told this is. Written as well as other comic book fare suck as Dark Knight Trilogy, not bad considering this is the third film in a series. There is no sequelitis here and in fact becomes a major turning point for the Avengers. I even heard someone called this Avengers 2.5.

Make no mistake I'm for Team Cap, Steve grew up in World War II and he learned first hand the problems with the reliance on global concerns above doing the right thing.  A League of Nations didn't stop Hitler and only made him stronger, along with HYDRA. Tony relies on the need to set limits but deep down wants respect and admiration from the world. As far as I'm concerned he was a sellout and only interested in trying his best for himself and not the world and of course the team.

Yet as this goes down a mysterious third party is using a traumatic incident from the Winter Soldier's past against the Avengers as they splinter from within. This leads to an awesome encounter between Captain America vs Iron Man first in an encounter with their respective teams and finally one on one in an abandoned HYDRA bunker which is epic as the original comic.

Civil War or Avengers 2.5 gets its name from having Captain Americas team of Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man fight against Iron Man, War Machine, Vision, Black Widow alongside two newcomers. Black Panther and Spider-Man.

Black Panther. What can it be said? I knew next to nothing on him other than his fearsome costume, but his presence brought to life by Chadwick Boseman is an amazing gift to fans old and new.

Spider-Man. Marvel finally brings back its beloved hero to its Cinematic Universe and everyone should celebrate. Tom Holland brings back the teenaged innocence of the web-slinger that Tobey Maguire brought but also some of the modern style that Andrew Garfield brought. Though I would have loved it for Garfield's Spider-Man movies to be inserted in the MCU, this is still a pretty good actor in Holland and am really glad for his appearence.

Both newbies will get their own movies prior to the massive two-part Avengers sequels coming soon, but this is certainly a nice sample.

Truly an epic.",1518825600,,2767,4.6652977412731005
