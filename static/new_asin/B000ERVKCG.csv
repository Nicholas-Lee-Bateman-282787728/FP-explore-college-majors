8167646,2,B000ERVKCG,"This is a 1981 ""slasher"" film meant to cash in on the horror trends of the time, but done in such a slipshod way that it ends up being hilarious instead, in the great tradition of artistic B-movie incompetence established by Ed Wood. It's worth a view for that very reason!

Some family and friends gather for Thanksgiving near LA and then-popular bodybuilder-trainer Jake Steinfeld (who is not exactly Laurence Olivier) escapes from a mental hospital, gets high on PCP and attacks them. That's it for plot, but there's plenty of unintentional comedy along the way as we get scenes of totally unconvincing death, acting that would make school play participants blush, and a character named ""Mistake,"" who is so utterly annoying that one watches in fascination to see if he can actually get worse (he does). SPOILER ALERT But ""Mistake's"" death scene has the potential to unite viewers of all races, creeds and nations into one cheering mass of happy humanity END SPOILER ALERT

For horror fans (once one stretches oneself to call this a horror movie) it is also of note that this is a very rare Thanksgiving-set horror, and that it came long before Eli Roth posed all hip on that subject.

A film watchable by anyone finding themself intrigued by this review, since it would have to be meant for you if you are!",1471996800,2,1310,4.7368421052631575
