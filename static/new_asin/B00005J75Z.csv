1429850,5,B00005J75Z,"If you liked 'Backbeat' you'll love this one. Filmed at all the actual locations where The Beatles started in Liverpool it's more accurate and revealing than just about anything done on the early years of the Fab Four. John Lennon is shown to be a complicated, brilliant but deeply flawed young man. You see the roots of many of his most famous songs including ""Julia"" (about his mother), ""Strwberry Fields"" (about a childhood play place), etc. This should have been released as an independent feature instead of a TV movie. I really loved it.",1005955200,2,543,4.787234042553192

1429872,5,B00005J75Z,"I really enjoyed this DVD on John Lennon's life up to  when the ""BEATLES""  came to AMERICA. It's one that any fan would enjoy. Being able to see the actual places John lived,went to school,played & the story of coming together with PAUL,George, Ringo is really awesome!",1274140800,,269,4.702127659574468

1429874,4,B00005J75Z,"The story may not be 100% accurate, but the acting is really good and the story is entertaining. Probably the best parts of the film are when John is with Brian Epstein. That part of John's life isn't talked about all that much, but it is always interesting to see and hear. What I liked most about this movie is that it goes a little further than the movie Backbeat. Although it isn't the Beatles singing, I also enjoyed how some of the more famous Beatles songs made it in. For a made-for-TV movie, I 'd say that this one is pretty good. You will enjoy it if you are a fan or maybe even not. Worth seeing.",1250467200,,607,4.1525423728813555
1429875,4,B00005J75Z,"Hi. I do like the movie. Some things weren't accurate and I think Philip did a really good job in this movie and I think he looked a lot like John too. I just have one question which I haven't seen online anywhere and was wondering if anyone can answer this and reply to me at my email address ladyhal@yahoo.com (in case regular email doesn't show up... ladyhal at yahoo dot com). Does Philip do the singing of John on here or does someone else? If so, who is it? They did a pretty good job singing like John but was wondering who did the singing? BTW, if you are a big Beatle/Lennon fan like me, you'll enjoy it even if some of it was inaccurate and stuff but what Beatle/Lennon movie is accurate that involves actors/actresses/etc. (besides documentaries)? Thanks in advance.

1429876,3,B00005J75Z,"As someone else already said, this was all covered in Birth of the Beatles, except for the scenes with John's mother, and with his father in Blackpool in 1946.

One other thing I wanted to mention was the notable absence of any Lennon-McCartney tunes, either as background music or played at their shows. (It's almost as if the producers didn't get the rights to the Lennon-McCartney catalog.) Sure they did a lot of covers back then, but other films show them playing I Saw Her Standing There and Love Me Do (and maybe others that escape me now).",1216512000,2,547,4.581632653061225
1429877,5,B00005J75Z,"This was one of the best jobs ever done on portraying the life of John Lennon and that of the early years of the Beatles. While the actor playing John looked a bit old for the earlier scenes, he made up for it in capturing the spirit of Lennon in those times. What really enhances this movie is the use of real Liverpool locations for the shoot. If you can't personally take the Beatles tours of Liverpool, this will be a great substitute. It was refreshing to see so more effort put in to getting the facts, locations, and feel right.",1124755200,,535,4.306930693069307
1429878,1,B00005J75Z,"Thats right, except for a couple of early scenes, this has all been done and better in Dick Clarks view of Beatle begginigs.

This film tries to cover too much in too short a time and ends up basically being a collage of 5 minutes each episodes about John and except for  a few snippets regarding his father and mother, the Birth of the Beatles covered the same time era and did it with a little more flow and linearity.

And just to nitpick, this was the worst looking early Lennon actor ive ever seen. I couldn't even be sure for a few minutes that this was the John Lennon actor, he couldve been anyone.",1120003200,,606,4.252173913043478
1429879,4,B00005J75Z,"This is a capably directed, better than average television movie about the beginnings of The Beatles, as seen through the eyes of John Lennon. The focus of the film is always on John and some of the people, places, and events that shaped his early life and made him the man he was to become. As its focus is on John Lennon, the other members of The Beatles take a back seat to John in the film.
The film, shot in the gritty, port city of Liverpool where John and the other Beatles grew up, shows how John (Phillip McQuillan) was reared  by his devoted Aunt Mimi (Blair Brown), his mother Julia's older sister. His mother, Julia (Christine Cavanaugh), also lived in Liverpool and he would visit with her, but his father was an absentee one and would remain nothing but a distant memory. John grew up in his Aunt Mimi's household, and it was she who governed much of his early life.  It was his mother, however, who was instrumental in John getting his first guitar.
The film shows the viewer some of the childhood places and people that would someday be memorialized in the music of The Beatles: Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Eleanor Rigby, and Julia. John's courtship of Cynthia (Gillian Kearney), the girl who would become his first wife, is also grist for the mill, as are his reasons for marrying her. The early popularity of The Beatles in Germany is touched upon, as is the tragic end of one of its original members and John's best friend, Stuart Sutcliffe (Lee Williams). Stuart was an artist who, while performing with the band in Germany, fell in love with a German girl named Astrid (Palina Jonsdottir) and left the band in order to marry her and remain in Germany.
The film shows how John and Paul McCartney (Daniel McGowan) met, as well as how George Harrison (Mark Rice-Oxley) came to join the group. The film deals with the issue of the replacement of their original drummer, Pete Best (Scott Williams), with Ringo Starr (Christian Ealey), when on the brink of success. It also shows how their local popularity brought them to the attention of record store owner, Brian Epstein (James Glover), and what he did to help make them them the most popular rock band of all time. One sees their arrival in America and their auspicious and memorable debut on the Ed Sullivan show.
Phillip McQuillan, whose physical resemblance to John Lennon is slight, at best, gamely tackles the lead role of John Lennon with much bravado, playing him as a bit of a bad boy with a good heart and a dream of rock and roll fame. He also manages to get John's intonations and inflection down pretty pat. Blair Brown does a wonderful job with the role of  Aunt Mimi, the woman who managed to put some structure and order to John's early life. Christine Kavanaugh whimsically plays the role of John's mother, the woman from whom John appeared to have inherited his creative juices. Gillian Kearney gives an excellent portrayal of John's first wife, Cynthia.
Daniel McGowan, who actually resembles Paul McCartney in a peculiar sort of way, infuses the role of Paul with an intelligence that is palpable. Mark Rice-Oxley, however, is wooden and does nothing to bring the role of George Harrison to life.  As he does not even resemble him, his portrayal of George is jarringly out of place. Christian Ealey, who somewhat resembles Ringo, fares better and does a more than passable job in the role of Ringo Starr, the Johnny come lately who was in the right place at the right time. Last but not least, James Glover give an excellent portrayal of Brian Epstein, the man who shrewdly and firmly set them on the road to rock and roll stardom.
All in all, this is a better than average made for television film. If you are not a fan of The Beatles, especially John Lennon, however, you would do well to deduct one star from my review.",1024185600,14,3813,4.611192930780559
1429880,5,B00005J75Z,"I watched this movie in November of 2000 on tv. This is a great movie about John Lennon and how the Beatles got started. It's a memorable movie that you won't forget.

7938611,2,B00005J75Z,"The actor playing John Lennon sounded so much like Paul O'Grady I couldn't take him seriously and he was far too large a person. Actors playing George and Ringo barely speak and are scarcely referred to, Paul who fares a little better in the speaking part is shown as a scheming, backbiting piece of work that Lennon doesn't appear to like. Rivalry ... yes, lots of joking and taking the mickey ...yes, cold shouldered indifference ... no and yet Lennon appears to be indifferent to the band members in the film. Brian Epstein features much more than any of the 3 other Beatles. There was not one scene of creative collaboration with McCartney, not even a mention ... which is just weird considering it's one of the most well known facts about John Lennon.

If you are looking for historical accuracy or the warmth and humour The Beatles reflected on stage and in interviews, which is what I was hoping for, this film isn't for you, the music is OK but there are no Beatles songs. If you want the media driven, ""Saint John Lennon"" and everyone else looking like hangers on basking in the reflected glow of Johns immense talent -  it's probably your thing. All The Beatles were talented (yes even Ringo who is remarkably consistant, you don't always need an off the rails drummer you have to muscially wrestle with like the glorious but unbiddable Keith Moon!) it would have been nice to have seen a little more of the talent, friendship and bond that these 4 men shared and was forged early in their muscial careers and most certainly an important part of John Lennon's life.",1461456000,,1575,4.621428571428571
7938612,5,B00005J75Z,"This is an excellent made for TV movie about the inception of the Beatles from the viewpoint of John Lennon.  In John's life, he's loved them all.  John is the hub on which the movie turns.  Viewers gain insight into the influences that created and molded the then future Chief Beatle.

Filming this movie in Liverpool made it all the more authentic.  Liverpool, a gritty seaport in the north of England is the birth place of the Beatles and has long since become synonymous with the fab quartet.  Viewers take a Magical Mystery Tour with John, who was raised by his maternal Aunt Mimi.  John's natural mother,  Julia lived in the area and had sporadic contact with John while John's father (""that Alf Lennon"" as the Stanley Sisters called him) was out of the picture for a good portion of John's life.

Julia, the youngest of the Stanley Sisters was also musical and it is from Julia as well as John's paternal grandfather, another man named John Lennon who would bequeath musical talent to the Chief Beatle.  Julia taught John banjo when he was a child and John also got his first ""mouth organ"" (harmonica) as a boy.  He demonstrated musical prowess from a very early age.

Fans will see places immortalized in Beatle classics such as Penny Lane and its famous Roundabout; Strawberry Fields; Quarrybank High and the art college where John met his first wife Cynthia.

The pre-Fabs get good coverage.  The period of 1960 - 1962 when the Beatles made the scene in Hamburg is included as well as former bandmate Stuart Sutcliffe (1941 - 1962) who would remain in Germany; marry the pre-Fabs' friend Astrid Kircherr and tragically die in Germany in 1962.

Pete Best, the poorly matched drummer for the group was sacked in 1962 and this is well addressed in the movie.  One can't help but feel sorry for Pete as he plainly was not a good fit or a good match for the group.  Beatles' manager Brian Epstein is given his place in the sun and the highlight of the movie was February 7, 1964 (Beatles' Day!) when the Beatles came to America!

Fans will likely find the actors don't always resemble their true-life counterparts and for some this can be somewhat disconcerting.  That having been said, the cast in this  movie overcame that obstacle by delivering rock solid performances and convincing deliveries.

As for the actors playing the roles of the other Beatles, only Daniel McGowan presents Paul McCartney in a convincing way.  He rightfully portrays his Beatle counterpart as brilliant and infused with unstoppable talent.  George, on the other hand was a background figure and he was not convincing in the movie.  Sadly, the actor who played George more or less gave a stilted performance which was disappointing.  He also looked not a darn thing like George.  Ringo is given a fairly plausible presentation in this movie.

Even so, remember this is a made for TV movie.  It is really quite good all things considered.",1439856000,,2921,4.742063492063492

7938618,4,B00005J75Z,"Lets face it, the movie is about John Lennon's early years with the beatles. It does involve the Beatles but its rather a glimpse into the creation and rise of the beatles through the eyes of what John Lennon may have seen and hardships hat he may have gone through. I do personally believe that ""Nowhere Boy"" was a better film but it end as John Lennon is leaving to gig in Hamburg. This film however covers more of what happens in the events before and after the Hamburg days.
this film fits more chronologically with two other movies to get a FULL view of Lennons life, career and Success in a fictional based viewpoint of course. But if you watch ""in His Life: The John Lennon Story"" it ends with the beginning of Beatlemania, ""John Lennon Naked"" picks up almost where ""In his life"" leaves off, at the end of beatlemania where John Lennons father tracks him down the Beatles Manager Dies. ""John Lennon Naked"" ends with John Lennon moving to NY with Yoko. and the third film ""The Two of Us"" is a fictional portrayal of Lennon and McCartney meeting up and talking about old times and talking about where they go from then on. watch all Three its a great fictional glimpse into the entire life of John Lennon.",1353888000,,1210,4.454954954954955
