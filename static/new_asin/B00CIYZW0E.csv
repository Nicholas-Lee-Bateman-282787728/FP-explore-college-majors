8582256,5,B00CIYZW0E,"An hour-long documentary about the late 19th century - beginning of the 20th century China and the US involvement in the region. It's well informed, very detailed and educational. Although it's an independent documentary, it is professionally made. It raises many interesting questions - in fact, I think that is its strongest point: it leaves you with many more questions than it answers. In this case this is a good thing because one feels better educated on a very current subject in the modern world and better informed and prepared to follow developments on it. Interesting piece of work.",1377907200,,593,5.0
8582257,5,B00CIYZW0E,"This is a thorough and well researched look at the events of the first part of the twentieth century, and the effect on American and Chinese relations. With an interest in Chinese history and modern politics, I was pleased to come across what looked like a good analysis of this area - and I was impressed with the results.

One of the early lines of the documentary sums up its main themes well, explaining how it looks at ""the events which turned American from China's most promising friend in Asia into one of its fiercest foes."" Such events form an important and fascinating part of modern history, both for China and the rest of the world, but are not often covered in analysis of such times, especially outside specialist texts.

I came at this from the point of view of my interest in modern China and where it is going. With such a mixed history occurring over such a short time in the country, it is easy to miss out vital parts of the past in studying China. Despite so much change in the county, many things are the same as they have been for some time (notably the leadership and peoples beliefs and values), and the study of recent past events is so important to understand the place today. There was a time when the US and China could have become close partners, and understanding how this came about, and failed to take root, is an important turning point in history.

The failing of western diplomacy to engage with China are as important today as they were at this time. Opinions differ on whether such failings are due to western ignorance of China, or Chinese self-assertiveness. These issues remain today, and the discussion of this, presented well from both sides, is a fascinating lesson as to how we got to where we are now.

These are not the only issues dealt with though, and the film has equal interest and value to anyone interested in the events surrounding the First World War, or indeed in America's early twentieth century foreign policy. Despite being an amateur documentary production, there is no lacking in quality of research. In fact, you get the feeling that the producers have been very free to explore different areas and express opinions openly; with such sensitive topics this is not always the case.

The style too is engaging, and very easy to watch. The details are there, but presented in a way which keeps your attention. This is a credit to such a film, where information can be complex and quality historic footage limited. I have seen many such attempts struggle in this area, and this can result in an interesting but hard to follow commentary. There is much involvement from key experts and academics, and historical details intermixed with expert opinions like this really adds to the presentation.

I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in Chinese history, World War history or the modern shaping of global powers. It is unusual to see such quality discussion of such important historical events, and this short, but very well made, film will enlighten anyone with the slightest interest.",1377734400,,3062,4.724719101123595
8582258,5,B00CIYZW0E,"This documentary is absolutely fascinating. China, as this documentary details, was the only country whose delegates walked out on the treaty of Versailles, refusing to sign. I think this is very telling of Chinese-western relations and is a small fact that refracts into a much larger picture of why China has failed to morph into the superpower that Japan and other countries have today, even with its great size and depth. As a dedicated student of the world war era and politics, I haven't come across many texts that mention China as anything more than a side note; however, here is a powerful look at how the U.S. spoiled its own chance at alliance with and the democratization of China before those world wars even began (yes, it would ironically be the treaty of Versailles, the treaty that ultimately failed in some ways, that would completely harden the Chinese against western thought and leadership). My favorite part of the documentary was that it honed in on specific individuals and their relationships as the potential turning points for U.S.-Chinese relations, particularly Homer Lea. Lea was not only engaged in Chinese life right at the fall of Chinese dynasty when he helped instill democratic leadership into China, but his invitations to U.S. congressmen to befriend China right after the dynasty fell are the ones that ultimately could have had a drastic affect on foreign relations all over the globe and even in the outcomes of the World Wars. The documentary also hones in on Japan as China's quicker, more adaptive neighbor; Japan experienced what China could not, including an efficient spread of western idea for which China was simply too big--geographically and culturally. The competition between the two states would result in what the Chinese saw as a betrayal by western leadership and a mainly monetarily strategic move by western power that shattered Chinese identity and embittered China against both western and competing Japanese powers. The poverty and displacement China has experienced for decades is attributed to political and international shortcomings that are astounding and very telling when placed into the larger view of the world war era that historians have already done so well to develop.

Film here again has advantages over textbook presentation; the clips, interviews, and images are compelling and may be more engaging for some students than traditional learning. History teachers will find this an excellent addition to a lesson on Chinese or foreign relations or in a discussion on the growth of democracy; similarly, scholars in all disciplines will find this story fascinating--economists, geologists, strategists, etc. It is an encapsulated experience of one country that failed to democratize, and it can be a lesson (both for and against) further efforts by westerners with democratic agendas toward other states.

I would recommend this documentary to anyone interested in history and believe they will be interested in its niche timeline and its accompanying implications. The main reason I like it is that it is an unusual viewpoint on a very combed over part of history. I'm glad I came across it.",1377216000,,3167,5.18359375
8582259,5,B00CIYZW0E,"We live in a world that currently seems to want purely to thrive on media sensation. For once, it is nice to see a documentary that does what documentaries are supposed to do: educate and enlighten. This excellent piece of work seamlessly merges archive footage, subtle animations and interviews to present its subject in a suitable and non-sensationalist manner.

Naturally, the subject matter is quite pertinent in consideration to the current financial downturn of the Western World and the mind-blowing amounts of money that developed nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom owe China, with no hope of repayment seemingly currently on the horizon. China seems content to remain secretive in comparison to, say, the bombastic spear-waving of North Korea, which many western observers find a little disconcerting. This documentary explores some of the reasons perhaps why China adopts this stance, and how things could have worked out differently if not for some examples of alarming prejudice.

It is also quite alarming to consider how differently major incidents in our world history may have turned out if some seemingly unconnected events had played out differently, and I feel this is where the documentary consistently engages and educates. The startling rise of Japan through the early part of the twentieth century I found to be at odds with my perceived understanding of this aspect of world history and I was happy to be re-educated.

As Westerners I guess we can be guilty of perceiving events that occurred in the Western World purely from our Western bias, and particularly Europe, as that has been the major battleground for two devastating world wars. At times it's difficult to remember there's always been the Rest of the World beyond Europe and North America. I found the period in the documentary explaining the Japanese and Chinese influences on events surrounding the First World War particularly illuminating. I certainly had no idea that many of the trenches dug upon the Western Front were done so via the hands of thousands of forcibly hired Chinese labourers. There's no doubt the Chinese were considerably short-changed for their contribution to victory over the Kaiser's forces in the First World War and it's interesting to learn how the China welcomed the new Soviet Union as allies and gradually became a Communist state.

If I have one criticism of this documentary it is the music, which at times is overbearing and during some periods of the film is unnecessary. Also, sometimes during an interview the interviewee will suddenly be 'mirrored', instantly switching from looking left to looking right, and this can be slightly off-putting. The narration is consistently excellent, though.

In conclusion, this is an engaging piece of work that is well-worth fifty minutes of your time.",1377043200,,2837,5.172113289760349
8582260,5,B00CIYZW0E,"As a person of Chinese ancestry, we are often taught about the honorable, hardworking and wise history of the leaders of the motherland. Being educated in the West, I was also taught about the Western values of democracy and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Because of this, I firmly believe that history is written by the victorious to inspire patriotism. The mistakes of each nation are often disregarded in their own version of this history. It is refreshing to see the amalgamation of both sides of the past in a well researched and logically narrated account of both nations.

The Men who Lost China shows an interesting perspective on the period of industrialization and reveals the disparity in the memory of the world's two most powerful nations. The film makers unfold some unconventional thoughts on the evolution of Chinese culture, politics and ideas of the early 1900s that are surprisingly similar to the history of other nations and their rise from imperialism. A intriguing film about war, patriotism and perceived betrayal that will leave you pondering the ""what if""s of history.

Highly recommended as this film will open your eyes to a part of history that is traditionally overlooked in a classroom.",1376956800,,1243,5.0
8582261,5,B00CIYZW0E,"This film is a beautifully produced documentary filled with both visually appealing and disturbing images, and presents genuine interviews which offer insight into modern Chinese history. With an emphasis on the consequences of World War I, the facts and commentary flow into a cohesive story which enlightens and educates the viewer. A masterful musical score enhances the video which brings has an underlying passion evident in the documentary. Within this atmosphere of entertainment and learning, the narration is clear and precise.

The mixture of graphics, photos, sketches and old films keeps one's attention while offering insight into Chinese politics and government like nothing before. Superior editing and production proves the vast enthusiasm director Mitch Anderson has for his film. This documentary analysis is comprehensive and informative and a valuable tool in assessing how past events are affecting the modern global community.

I found the film very engaging and enlightening. The music and overall presentation were quite impressive. This is a worthy documentary which I will recommend to my friends who love history, world polities and those in the education field.",1376697600,,1189,5.6
8582262,5,B00CIYZW0E,"This is a remarkable documentary covering the history of China in the first half of the 20th Century.  It shows how after centuries of monarchy, there were a number of opportunities for China to become a modern, democratic republic.  Those opportunities were squandered, however, and this film explains the reasons, most of which I wasn't aware.  I found it very surprising.

The overall failure of Western diplomacy, especially the US, to befriend China early on (after the fall of the last emperor), and then again and again when the chances were there, is one of the great tragedies of the last hundred years or so, I think, and this film points out all the familiar reasons: self-interest, hypocrisy, arrogance, simple inattention and incompetence--the list is endless. (A couple of World Wars didn't help, either.)

But at the top of the list you'd have to put straight ignorance: our ignorance of Chinese history, culture, thought and sensitivities, plus Chinese misunderstanding of Western motives (and idealism).  I think this documentary and other programs like it go a long way toward rectifying that situation.

This is especially interesting and thought-provoking because so many Middle Eastern nations are trying to make the same transition from totalitarianism to democracy that might have been China's road a hundred years ago.  Making that shift--zero to democracy in years, not centuries--at the moment doesn't look like it's going to work for the people of the Middle East any better than it worked for China, but we in the US are still working on it after a couple of hundred years and one civil war, so maybe it just takes time.

It would be nice if we didn't make the same mistakes with Egypt, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Turkey that we made with China, but right now it sure looks like the same movie again.

8582263,5,B00CIYZW0E,"I was a bit skeptical about what seemed a low budget, no name documentary, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be.
The writer did extensive research on the intricacies of the East-West politics of a hundred years ago, and this definitely shows in the film.  The story was laid out logically and drew me in, by the end of the film, I wished the makers went even deeper in the subject matter.
Finally the film made me reflect on how the misguided decisions  our leaders made  a century ago,  still haunt us now.

Good job to the makers,

8582264,5,B00CIYZW0E,"I watched countless WW1 documentaries, including a ""WW1 in Color"" believe it or not...  They are generally very well done but they all have been neglecting the Far East.  They all seem to cover the same things: the Sarajevo assassination, the battles of Verdun, the birth of USSR, but lets face it, a hundred years from now all these events will become footnotes on history books.  A colossus is rising from the Far East, and weather we like it or not, the way China feels about us, ""The West"", will one day matter more than everything else.  Yet, historians and authors are rather slow in delving in the deep issues of Asian history.
I guess there is an inertia in the curriculum, like in everything else. Generation after generation of professors hands down textbooks covering our over glorified ""History of the Western world"", while Far East matters are reserved for ""Asian Studies"" classes.

Well, I am glad to see that this film is an exception to the rule. While is still far from a complete analysis of the China-West interaction at the beginning of the 20th century, I must confess that it made me realize how much I didn't know about the history of that region.

Kudos to the makers. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone.
