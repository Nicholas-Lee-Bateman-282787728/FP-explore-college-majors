2816475,5,B000PDZRZA,Another Good Western with values that kids should be learning today. Gabby runs a ranch for homeless and wayward boys that is about to be foreclosed on. A young boy tried to pay it off with stolen money that his father had given him to hide. He learns you can't do things like that. The other men in the holdup try to hurt him and others.

2816512,2,B000PDZRZA,"Was in the mood for a little nostalgia so watched this hour-or-so long pic with Roy and Dale from their Republic Studios days. Forgot that Dale was such a hottie in the 40's! They sing a few songs in this oh-so-predictable morality tale. Still, it's nice to see that there was a day when America believed in its heroes- before Vietnam, Watergate and the cynical and biased media. Unless you're looking for a trip down memory lane, you might wanna pass on this one.",1372118400,,464,4.535714285714286

Two teenage boys are found by a railroad boxcar; they want to go to a ranch. A banker tells Gabby she will foreclose on his ranch since payments on the loan are missing. Gabby will take those boys to his ranch. Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers sing on the radio. Next he will visit Half A Chance ranch for homeless boys. Three boys play a prank on a road; this scares the horses on a wagon and causes a runaway. Roy stops the wagon. Gabby trains the boys to sing. He tells Roy about his debts. Two boys play a prank on Clarence. Three men visit the barn. Boys fight outside. Roy visits King Blaine, who offers to help Gabby. Blaine kills people and robs banks; his son Chip lives on the boys ranch. The Sheriff arrives, Blaine and his men ride off. Roy rides with the Sheriff. Blaine is shot and captured; he asks to see Gabby and gives him a deed to a garage in Kansas City. Blaines daughter works in Kansas City.

Roy learns the garage burned down and is worthless. Roy visits The Golden Spur, a nightclub on 12th Street. There are songs. Roy talks to Blaines step-daughter. Two men lure Chip to the Barstow Ranch that night. They tell him a lie - Gabby Whittaker killed his father! Then they ask him for the money King Blaine sent him. Chip says he knows nothing, but they try to force him to talk. When the people notice Chip is missing they ride off to search for him. The Sheriff and his men are looking for Blaines two men. They arrive at the Barstow Ranch and gunfire erupts! The wanted men ride away. The Sheriffs men find Chip, who rides away until Roy catches him. Miss Saunders arrives and meets Chip. Later there is a calf roping and a song. This is getting pretty ridiculous says a boy. Miss Saunders shows that letter to Roy. Those two boys play another prank on Clarence. Chip inspects that hidden package - it contains a package of cash.

Those two men show up to threaten Chip. When Gabby tries to help they shoot him! Roy and the others arrive. The doctor says Gabby will soon recover. In the dark Chip inspects that package. Roy notifies the banker about a law - it is unlawful to evict minor children who would become public charges. But the money was paid that night! Roy asks Chip about it - he admits it. There is about $35,000 more! That night there is another song about spooks. Gabby sings too. The banker shows up to tell about the money - it was stolen from the bank! Blaines two men show to rob this money. They are chased, there are gunshots in the night. Roy Rogers captures the King Blaine Gang. Later there is activity at the ranch. The banker will tear up the loan agreement as a reward. There is a final song to celebrate.

This is a good story about how a ranch is saved from foreclosure. It provided a place for homeless boys. The Great Depression resulted in many homeless, called tramps because of their walking from place to place. It asks a moral and legal question: should stolen money be used for a good purpose (paying off a mortgage)? But the end doesnt always justify the means.",1467763200,,3053,4.3321678321678325
