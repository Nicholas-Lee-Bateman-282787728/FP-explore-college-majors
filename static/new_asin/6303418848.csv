There was a lot of potential for a video about roller coasters. There could have been scientific tidbits about centrifugal force or how roller coasters affect our senses and bodies.  They could have talked about how roller coasters are designed or given a close up look at the mechanics of a roller coaster.  The other ""There goes..."" videos from KidVision have always had humor and silly antics, but also taught children something about the profession or vehicle which was the topic of the video.  This video has no redeeming value.  What a sell-out.  I wonder what will be next in the series...maybe ""Here Comes a Chevy Suburban""???",1075852800,4,771,4.803030303030303

If the person, who is going to watch it, gets a adrenaline rush through watch roller coasters on screen go and buy. Yes it did make me want to go to Six Flags. I finally got to go in July 2003. It was great!!! So there is some good in the movie. Bad Music!!!",1057881600,,378,3.7375
