7900124,2,7884219816,"This DVD appears to be only in Chinese (there are no subtitles).  It does not play on a regular DVD although it did on my computer. It looks fine, but I cannot tell what it is about since I do not speak or read Chinese.  There was nothing in the announcement of this product that indicated it was only in Chinese (at least I assume it is Chinese - the characters appear to be more like that than Korean or Japanese).",1394582400,,416,4.1234567901234565
