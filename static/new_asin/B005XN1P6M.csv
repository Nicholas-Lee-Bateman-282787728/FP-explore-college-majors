8488746,1,B005XN1P6M,"Interesting enough, but early on takes a couple of unfair and somewhat out of place ""Anti-Catholic"" jabs at the Catholic Church.
Possibly there to earn its street cred in Protestant children religious education classes which is probably this films best venue.
Unbelievably this film during the pre-war runup(1933-39) phase of the documentary(1st episode) blames the 1944 'Ardeatine Caves massacre' of Italian partisans by German Occupation troops in Rome before their retreat from advancing American troops on the Catholic Church. Within the documentary they refer to this solely as the ""1944 Massacre in Rome""(Wikipedia:  'Massacre in Rome'). One reference to the Catholic Church being responsible for any of this comes from the plot line of the 1973 movie 'Massacre in Rome'(1944 Ardeatine Caves Massacre) starring Richard Burton in which a fictional priest Fr. Pietro Antonelli((Marcello Mastroianni) has complicity in the script. In addition, the charge was levied earlier in the  60's in which one book author blamed the Vatican for its silence during and/or after the massacre. Of course, its silence was under dire and lethal occupation and in Rome secreted away in ..""all the convents, all the religious houses of Rome were full of refugees, Communists, Jews, democrats and anti-Fascists, ex-generals, etc."" It would seem that any stick, even a false one, is perfectly suitable for beating on the Catholic Church. I don't mind honest critcism as Christians we should all be open to that in our personal lives and of our Church, but this film and its producers have crossed that threshold into hate, propaganda and lies.

Back to the review:
Fastpaced, fasttalking, fastclipped, staccato type delivery of a documentary. Takes the familar WWII history and footage we've all seen in the other documentaries and retreads it with just a spoonful of theology and serves it in a fast talking preacher style. Oh it does mention or gloss over the keywords 'modernism' and 'secularism', but then never lingers over anything long enough for any kind of depth. Clips and footage changes every 1,2 and 3 seconds , frenetic. Okay documentary, but shallow, falls a bit below the average mark. I watched this through the 3rd episode and halfway through the 4th episode. Past the halfway mark of this 7 episode documentary! 4th episode improved in quality and presentation over the first 3, slowed down its delivery and started going deeper, but it already lost me. I had already seen the footage and the narrative was the same old, same old,  although adding some punctuation of Christian concepts and ideas. Somewhere around the 4th episode, I noticed the Civil War Documentary by Burns that was running on another PBS station even though it was a rerun for me. So I ditched in favor of the Civil War rerun by Burns which is probably the best one on the Civil War.

Its obvious that the quality/depth of the first 3 episodes of this documentary  is lacking either to time/budget constraints or this frenetic visual( and talking )pace was required, just maybe , to keep the attention of a predominantly school children audience. Either way, this is just an avg. WWII documentary with the same old footage and storyline with nothing really special to offer, Not recommended for adults, but possibly an adequate program within a Christian/Protestant religious format for schoolchildren. If you've seen the WWII faire of the History Channel, then spelunking cash down on this is a hard sell.

In the Final Analysis:
I give it an average mark for Adults/Children/Christian Religious Classrooms  : 3 stars ***
But in the end analysis since it brutally, unfairly and without any claim to honesty or conscious attacks my Catholic church  : 1 star * .",1352505600,4,3735,5.079934747145187
8488747,5,B005XN1P6M,"This DVD series is a documentary narrated by Doug Phillips and William Potter. Its format is a series of amazing stories of the soldiers, leaders and politicians on the Allied and Axis sides. Many of these stories were new to me. A lot of file footage from the invasion and lead up is presented. Seven episodes span the 4 DVD's:
  Episode 1: The Theological Significance of the Second World War
  Episode 2: The Strategic Overview
  Episode 3: The Theology of Leadership on D-Day
  Episode 4: Deception, Intelligence, and Spying for D-Day
  Episode 5: The Decision to Go
  Episode 6: The Men of D-Day and the Meaning of Manhood
  Episode 7: The Aftermath

Highly recommended!",1336176000,5,693,4.836206896551724
