7076179,2,B00V111B9G,"A word of caution. This was video taped in 1974. It's of great historic value, however nothing has been done to improve the picture and especially the sound of this event It's wonderful seeing all these great musicians paying tribute to Muddy, but I'll guess the reason this took so long to release was that the people involved hated the way it sounded. Most of them are no longer with us.
What can you do? It's 1974 and presenting a loud blues band on TV hadn't been figured out yet.
Again, the music is first rate, the sound and picture...not so much.",1437091200,4,553,4.431372549019608

7076182,4,B00V111B9G,"This is a great DVD from a 1974 show honoring Muddy Waters in Chicago.  If you are a blues fan, the list of contributors alone will make you want to own this.  Muddy and his band are joined at various points by Junior Wells, Mike Bloomfield, Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Dr. John and Buddy Miles.  The hour long program  includes Long Distance Call, Messin' with the Kid, Stop Breaking Down, Mannish Boy, Wang Dang Doodle, Walking through the Park Hoochie Coochie Man, Sugar Sweet and the obligatory closer Got My Mojo Workin'.  Great stuff even if the set list contains a lot of old war horses.  The video and audio quality could be better but the historic value alone justifies this release.

While there may be better Muddy Waters performance DVD's out there, this one is infinitely better than the Checkerboard Lounge set recorded seven years later (1981) with the Rolling Stones.  Mick Jagger was clearly out of his league sharing a stage with Muddy in that one.",1433635200,9,965,4.7023809523809526

7076190,2,B00V111B9G,"The unacceptable screeching and squalling audio on this DVD is due to a careless transfer from analogue tape to digital disc, not due to poor recording techniques in 1974. I would wager that the VHS version (no longer available) would have sounded just fine. PBS is re-airing this episode as of this writing. It has been appropriately engineered, and the sound does these historic performances justice. If viewers can record the broadcast, they'll have a much more satisfactory listening experience. If not, this DVD will provide a semblance of this magnificent concert.",1444867200,11,570,5.206521739130435

8708932,4,B00V111B9G,"I was happy to receive this DVD. The performances were all worth watching. However, the sound quality IS lacking. Other reviewers have noted this. Sometimes the piano is nearly inaudible. I recommend the DVD because, after all, it's MUDDY WATERS, but any potential purchaser needs to know about the less-than-stellar sound. Read the two star reviews before you purchase!",1486252800,,370,5.288135593220339
