I assure you, this is not official merchandise. What you behold here is bootleg copy created by a Taiwan distributor. You'll see their official seal of authenticity near the lower corner of the product (see seller's picture). But here's the catch, its not authentic. What you're buying here are cheep rips from the video as aired on nickelodeon. Product wise, you're going to get a grainy picture and possibly whole missing episodes. So, as a fan, I encourage you to pay the whopping $15 a season for the authentic series.",1383350400,18,682,4.691666666666666
8459443,5,B0056DH1IU,I think it would be awesome if they made this!  I'd wait even longer if they bundled it with all the new Korra seasons that are coming out soon.,1357603200,5,144,3.9655172413793105
