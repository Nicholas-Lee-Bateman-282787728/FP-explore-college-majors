3918919,5,B002EOVXA6,"Dark Shadows was an amazing experience for millions of people in the 1960's.  If you want to know what the fever was all about back then, this is the DVD to get.  The creator of the series not only gives you a gothic setting in a world that entertains, but gives you characters to care about.  See what started what is now considered an iconic masterpiece.  The first Vampire ever seen that had a CONSCIENCE!  Wrap yourself up in a time warp and join the Collins Family as they begin their journey into the depths of...DARK SHADOWS!",1265846400,6,532,4.443298969072165
3918920,5,B002EOVXA6,"I purchased this video and was very pleased. They have condensed the entire 1700's Barnabas becomes a Vampire story line with Josette and Angelique quite well. This video is worth a look.
Quality was very good in these transfers. Too bad the second DVD in this series wasn't as good. (The Quentin Collins Ghost Story).
I look foward to future condensed story lines if they are released.",1259452800,7,386,4.776119402985074
3918921,1,B002EOVXA6,"The story of Barnabas Collins has fascinated viewers for decades.  The new DVD ""Curse of the Vampire"" attempts to condense months of soap opera episodes into a three hour presentation.  Unfortunately this DVD just doesn't get the job done.  On paper, it's a great idea.  Some people may not want to watch several months worth of stories to see how Barnabas became a vampire.  However the execution is awful.

I LOVE ""Dark Shadows"".  The story of Barnabas Collins and his transformation into vampire is one of the best vampire stories ever done in film or TV.  ""Dark Shadows"" spent months telling the tragedy of Barnabas and his love Josette.  It was a well written story with an intriguing subplot of one of the show's main characters being transported back to 1795 to witness how everything went wrong for Barnabas.  Several other minor stories were weaved in as well.  Unfortunately none of them are shown in this 3 hour program and while time constraints prevented them from being put in, their absence makes for gaping holes in the central Barnabas story.

Newcomers to ""Dark Shadows"" will be lost trying to piece the story together since there is so much cut out.  Voiceovers would have helped tremendously in explaining things to the new viewer.  Even seasoned DS fans will have trouble following the story as it skips several key moments in the storyline, leaving the audience scratching their heads.

If you're not willing to watch the original run of episodes, I still suggest you skip this DVD.  Check out a DS website or wikipedia for a condensed version of the story.  This DVD is useless which is a shame as it's a waste of an excellent story.",1257897600,9,1656,4.754385964912281
3918922,3,B002EOVXA6,"With the resurgence in popularity of vampire novels and films and especially the talk of Tim Burton's remake of a DARK SHADOWS film starring Johnny Depp as Barnabus and Charlize Theron as Angelique, which is set to the vampire curse storyline of the late 1700's on the show,I was interested in it and so I purchased this dvd. The video quality was pretty good,the same as you get with the other episodes on dvd,but I think they could have cleaned it up a little better,cut the noise in the video's picture quality and edit out the on camera screw ups(like the scene where Angelique is being attacked by Barnabus in the moseleum and you see a set man in the corner moseleum).The editing was doen fairly well but I would much rather had the Jerimiah's ghost haunting of Angelique on her wedding night footage added into the storyline,instead of an old 1966 b&w episode which was in the special features,but the only real special feature's other than that, is Johnathan Frid rambling for a few minutes. So if you already own the dvd's of the show I wouldnt bother with this one ,but if you want an edited storyline of the 5th volume of the series focusing on Angelique's witchery & the vampire curse,it's a pretty good buy,but overall I think it was a great idea but they could have doen alot better.",1254268800,3,1297,4.570815450643777

This DVD is an edited edition of episodes from the 1795 storyline. If you have the unedited  VHS or DVD's this is hardly worth the money.

3918924,5,B002EOVXA6,"This disc, along with the other new DS DVD, are definately a must have if you are a casual fan of the show. For those of us with the complete collection already on DVD, there is nothing really new of interest. There is a nice NEW interview of Jonathan Frid, but it only runs a few minutes and leaves you wondering what happened to the rest of the interview. Just when you are getting into the interview, it chops off and ends. I guess they will be using the rest of it for some other re-issue down the road. There is also a 20 second PBS spot by KLS. Also included a a complete episode from the show.  I would have left that off and included more of the interview, at least this way there could have been more new content on the disc. For the common fan who has not purchased all 20+ box sets, this is a good disc to get, but for those of us who regularly watch the episodes, this disc will probably sit on a shelf collecting dust after the first viewing.",1253232000,25,955,4.106951871657754
3918925,5,B002EOVXA6,"Even after 40 years you can't kill Dark Shadows and its wonder why It hold a true hold over every one of us that would run home after school and see it on ABC TV at 4PM.So popular was the show that stores could not keep there bubblegum trading cards packs in stock. Right next to Bingham School here in Runnemede there was a little store named Chris's and the store owner would hold packs for My Friend Linda Difranco and Myself and we would spend all our money and buy up every pack. I'm so glad MPI has kept this fantastic series alive with new retrospectives like these and new interviews. Because we lived in New Jersey we could not go up like kids that lived in NY and stand outside the studios during the original filming of the Dark Shadows TV Series,But in retrospect I wish Linda and I could have went up there and met the actors in the day,what classic pictures they would have been. When I see shows like True Blood on HBO I cringe as they cant hold a candle to the original Dark Shadows. The actors Jonathan Frid,Kathreen Lee Scott,Lara Parker and others they might have messed up there lines among other goofs on the show but boy are they forever in our minds and hearts,something kids today with never no about.

3918926,5,B002EOVXA6,"Decades before Twilight there was Dark Shadows, the first-ever gothic soap opera, its supernatural stories captivating audiences young and old for almost 45 years.

With its alluring tales of Gothic mystery and supernatural intrigue, Dark Shadows became one of the most popular daytime series of all time. Since first airing on ABC-TV from 1966-71, Dark Shadows has earned the reputation of being one of the most unusual and enduring TV programs in history.

Thanks to MPI Home Video, that iconic Classic returns with two special DVDs compiling episode scenes from two of its most popular story arcs, one featuring the character Barnabas Collins, the vampire, the second disc featuring Quentin Collins, the werewolf.

Each disc, sold separately, contains about three hours of content, which includes selected scenes from color episodes as well as a new interview with the actor whose character is spotlighted.

Dark Shadows: The Curse of the Vampire, is devoted to the original beloved blood sucker from the realm of the undead - Barnabas Collins.

Barnabas, the 175-year-old guilt-ridden and love-lorn vampire, was portrayed brilliantly by the classically trained actor Jonathan Frid. Frid, now, in his 80's, was interviewed for this special compilation disc.

Dark Shadows debuted in June 1966, but faced cancellation because of poor ratings within a year. Creator Dan Curtis, desperate to save the show, decided to ""go"" supernatural, so he launched various spook-filled stories that led to the introduction of Barnabas.

Released from his chained coffin after nearly 200 years, Barnabas arrives at the Collinwood estate claiming to be a relative from England. Although noticing Barnabas' resemblance to his ""ancestor"" in a foyer portrait, the Collins family did not realize he is the same Barnabas who lived at Collinwood in the 18th century. As Barnabas moves into the Old House on the property, those around him are unaware of the horrors that will soon follow.

The vampire was to be a temporary character that would be killed off following a reign of terror, but Frid's compelling characterization caused Barnabas to remain throughout the series as ratings soared. Not only was the series saved from cancellation, but it became an international phenomenon boasting more than 20 million daily viewers! Frid also became incredibly popular, a sudden idol and sex symbol among teenaged girls.

In this special disc, the origin of Barnabas is told. From the Collinwood drawing room of 1967, the family governess, Victoria Winters, portrayed by Alexandra Moltke, is transported back in time via a seance ends up in the Collinwood of 1795. In the past, the Barnabas Collins of that era, BEFORE a vicious curse had turned him into the blood-thirsty vampire.

Barnabas is about to wed the love of his life, Josette Du Pres, but a jealous servant of Josette's with whom Barnabas had brief affair, successfully plots to ruin their relationship. The servant, Angelique, portrayed with verve by Lara Parker, is actually a witch born who uses her supernatural powers to wreck havoc on everyone in Collinwood. It is Angelique who places the curse of the living dead upon Barnabas.

The core brilliance of has made Dark Shadows endure are the eternal themes it illustrated: Love, death, fear, longing, revenge, obsession, lies, secrets, loyalty and betrayal all played out against a compelling backdrop of Gothic sensibilities that included vampires, werewolves, zombies, seances, time travel, ghosts, mystery, murder, intrigue and a constant dose of the unexpected.

This ""soap opera"" managed to transcend its genre by bringing a taste of Gothic horror and science-fiction fantasy to the hum-drum world of the afternoon drama. There had never been anything like it before - and there never has been since!

In addition to Frid, Parker and Moltke, primary co-stars on the disc are: Joan Bennett, Grayson Hall, Louis Edmonds, Nancy Barrett, David Henesy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, David Ford, Clarice Blackburn, John Karlen, Anthony George, Thayer David, Jerry Lacy, Craig Slocum, Sharon Smyth, and Joel Crothers.

Note: The entire series is available on DVD, also produced by MPI Home Video.",1245974400,77,4177,5.271084337349397

 I have ordered many of the Dark shadows dvd's, volume's 1,2,3 only, as I love the  black & white stories in there simplicity, I have also ordered the specialized dvd's this is one of them & it's mostly in color, however this is by far my favorite dark shadows dvd, as it tells the story very well of how Barnabas came to be.  I only have intrest in the first 3 volumes, because as the series went forward, I found there was way to many wacky story lines to be followed, and that my favorite Barnabas was the reason why I watched the series in the first place.  I only wish there was more specialized dvd's addressing the Barnabas story line. This dvd is by far my favorite hands down, so well worth the small price I paid for it, in comparsion to the other more expensive dvd volumes, I have purchased, if I could only have one dvd this would be it..",1434153600,4,1057,4.340101522842639

3918998,4,B002EOVXA6,"Back in 2009. I did not think I would buy this disc or its companion (The Haunting of Collinwood) after spending over a grand over a 6 year period to buy the whole series and the 3 standalone discs that go no you would able to buy all together in 2012 for better than 50% or even 75% in a coffin shaped mega set.  But when the chance to buy these 2 guys for like 5 bucks a pop each at the 2014 Fest, I figured why not, at the worst I have some stocking stuffers to give away someday.  This disc is basically a 3 hour summary of the 1795 storyline from after Victoria Winters goes back in time from the present, unknown to her to learn Barnabas' fate beginning with events like Angelique making him choke and the curing him, the duel with Jeremiah when Angelique makes the latter and Josette fall in love all the way up to when she turns him into a vampire for the first time, and Ben and Joshua eventually chain him in his coffin.  Then flashes forward to when Willie releases him in the present, and climaxes when he stops by the old house for the first time in centuries to talk to Josette's portrait.  Included as extras are the full episode when he meets Maggie in the present and an interview with Jonathan Frid not included in the series individual box sets or the mega set.  All in all a nice summary, but to understand it all better, you need the full series.  However, 5 years after its release I am not sorry I grabbed it,  I can at least show it to someone to wet their whistle and get them interested in the series, if they don't wanna come over and just watch episodes 1, 2, 3, etc and yell at me ""alright Pregosin you promised me a vampire now where is he?"".

3919026,4,B002EOVXA6,"THE VAMPIRE CURSE is a ""digest"" version of the Barnabas/Josette/Angelique plot from the 1795 arc of ""Dark Shadows"".  For what it sets out to achieve, it succeeds quite well.  The hardcore fans of course know this story backwards, sideways and inside-out, but for the uninitiated it will provide a tantalising entre into the world of this addictive series.

Collinwood's governess Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) is unexplainably swept back in time to 1795, where she witnesses the series of events which sealed the fate of Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid).  The house of Collinwood is buzzing with wedding preparations, for shortly Barnabas will marry his great love, Josette duPres (Kathryn Leigh Scott), who has just arrived from Martinique along with her aunt, the Countess Natalie (Grayson Hall) and maid Angelique Bouchard (Lara Parker).  There is one person, however, who seeks to destroy the happiness of the pair forever...

Props must be given for the way this program has been put together - the 1795 portion of ""Dark Shadows"" originally ran around 18 weeks, and to compress that down to a 3-hour DVD would've required the editors to have a clean ""line"" for which to follow in the episodes.  There were several plots and just as many characters in the 1795 arc, the most prominent in addition to the Barnabas/Josette/Angelique triangle was the rather-entertaining introduction of the fanatical Reverend Trask (Jerry Lacy) and Victoria being accused of witchcraft.  We briefly see that plot here, albeit it's one very small scene.

There are a few bonuses including an interview with Jonathan Frid, promos with Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby (the latter two talking about their books ""The Salem Branch"" and ""In and Out of the Shadows"") and a PBS fundraising spot from Kathryn Leigh Scott.  There is also an extra episode from ""Dark Shadows"" (#221, the one where Barnabas meets Maggie at the Collinsport Inn for the very first time).",1361836800,10,1963,5.12539184952978

3919052,4,B002EOVXA6,"Having seen the original series on TV, I did wonder how the editors were going to bring the whole story of 1795 together in a shortened format. Would it be something like a Cliff Notes summary? Thankfully, it can be said that the program has all the vital parts of the story in it. Still, to get the full flavor of the narrative, a viewing of each episode, complete, is very much in order.",1354838400,,389,4.27027027027027

3919054,2,B002EOVXA6,"Problem with this episode is that its just a compilation of various scenes from the original episodes and leaves out much of the details of how you get from one point in the story line to the next.  It is very disappointing.  Having seen the tv version and then watching this rendition of the tv series.  I would have to agree with the previous review that the ""Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse"" is not worth your money.  Do not buy it as you will be disappointed if you have seen the original series as this rendition has been butchered so badly that it leaves big holes in the story line.",1349481600,,589,4.327272727272727
3919055,5,B002EOVXA6,"This great collection of scenes from the ""1795"" storyline on ""Dark Shadows"" tells how Barnabas Collins (played to perfection by Jonathan Frid) became a vampire. When Victoria Winters (the Collin's governess is sent back in time) she discovers for herself and the audience how Barnabas became the creature he eventually became thus sending the Nielsen Rating's through the roof. For the first time in soap opera history a show's characters were sent back to the 1700's and one of the amazing things about this particular story were the breathtaking costumes. Obviously no expense was spared by Dan Curtis (the executive producer) or the ABC network. As the story is told at a very progressive and involving pace the ratings continued to soar.

 This story features the wonderful Lara Parker who played the beautiful and evil witch Angelique who is the antagonist in the story. After Barnabas (who had an affair with Angelique in Martinique) refuses her advances when she arrives in America Angelique decides to destroy him. After viewing all the episodes I have to say Angelique is one of the best villins in soap opera history who has a hand in every storyline pie.

 Lara Parker proved to be so popular with fans Dan Curtis and the network brought Lara back to the series in the present 1968 time and fans were extremely happy.",1344816000,,1328,4.888888888888889

3919067,5,B002EOVXA6,This DVD is the start of a great series in it's time. The DVD is in black and white and some is in color. It brings in old memories of what tv was like back in the sixties. Had no problems viewing this DVD.,1342051200,,206,3.7045454545454546
3919068,5,B002EOVXA6,I have loved Dark Shadows since I used to sneak into my Grandmas room to secretly watch the show with her. My mother would have kicked my rump if she had ever found out. The show was the first real soap opera and i was hooked. When the new movie came out I was shocked at the many differences from the original show. There is nothing like the ORIGINAL DARK SHADOWS. The seller I worked with was wonderful.,1341878400,,405,4.205128205128205

3919071,5,B002EOVXA6,"This is a great mini collection of episodes for all Dark Shadows fans.  It will bring you back to those days from more than 40 years ago when you raced home from school to watch it on TV and perhaps missed an occasional episode.  It goes right to the heart of the story of just how Barnabus Collins became a vampire under the curse from the spurned lover, the evil witch, Angelique.  Laura Parker was perfectly cast in that role with beautiful but evil looking eyes.  All actors are superb but especially Jonathan Frid who was a highly skilled Shakespearean theater actor.  Most of the scenes are staged as they would be in a theater.  Surely, there are some gaffs but those add to the enjoyment of the show for those of us who remember it.  For those too young to remember it, this collection provides a glimpse of the long story that captivated a generation of young people from 1966-1971.

3919072,5,B002EOVXA6,"This special DVD is basically a way for casual fans and curiosity seekers to sample the special Gothic mystery-
horror-romance blend of the classic 1966-71 ""Dark Shadows"" daytime drama series.

The months-long storyline of how Barnabas Collins became a vampire in 1795 has been condensed into a very enjoyable
3 1/2 hour movie format.

There's also a couple of nice bonus items from Jonathan Frid, Barnabas himself, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played
the vampire's doomed bride Josette.

With all the renewed attention on ""Dark Shadows"" thanks to the new Johnny Depp film version, it's nice to see the
original getting more exposure again and this DVD is the perfect way to get acquainted before watching all 1,225
complete episodes. There's also another storyline compilation called ""The Haunting of Collinwood"" that focuses on
the ""Turn of the Screw"" inspired ghost of Quentin Collins storyline from the show's late 1968, early 1969 period.
If you are interested in revisiting ""Dark Shadows"" or exploring it for the first time, this DVD is a great choice at a great price.",1318550400,6,1075,5.062146892655368

3919075,4,B002EOVXA6,"Really, this DVD is more something a long-time ""Dark Shadows"" fan might get for a friend or a relative to get them hooked on this most unique of ALL the daytime soap operas! (""First one's FREE, kid!"") Casual buyers ""on the fence"" for this may check out any ""DS"" websites, plus the Amazon feedback on every ""DS"" DVD set available here, and see if this interests you enough to get it NOW. (If you'd prefer waiting for the price to come down, it'll be worth the wait.) I have sporadically watched ""DS"" over the years, but what little I've seen always caught my interest, so I got this at a Walmart for [basically] the same price as on Amazon; considering what was done to make this LONGER storyline [from the show] into the ""condensed"" version on this disc, the producers (and the editors) did an above-average job. No matter how this ""origin of Barnabas"" were edited by ANYBODY at ANY LENGTH, there's no best way to do so; ironically, the ones who are most displeased with this are those who already have the WHOLE story on DVD! As for this ""Brother-Fang-come-lately"", this compilation works well, despite those inevitable story gaps that had to be sacrificed, or the ""abbreviated"" version would be LESS so! It's a ""no win"" situation for MPI, asthetically speaking, but they're out to get people to INVEST (as in, ""Buy ALL the DVD sets!"") in ""DS"", so this release is the stuff of marketing. Even so, this is a dandy partial ""primer"" on the show. Video quality is decent, with occassional anomalies in the video masters, more in the picture than the sound. You even get a sampling of ""bloopers"" throughout the story, including badly-read lines, shadows from the boom mike, and best of all, what ELSE you see when Barnabas gets bitten by the bat that will turn him into a vampire! (If you don't know what ""ELSE"" is, well... no spoilers!) The bonus material has been covered well by the other reviewers, so what I can add is I enjoyed them all, especially the uncut b&w episode.... Overall, if you've got a little money to burn, and you wish to reacquaint yourself with ""DS"", or see what the big deal was about this serial in the first place, this is your BEST bet, after finding someone who'll lend you all the ""DS"" DVDs from THEIR collection you want to see. Good luck with the latter!... All the best, Brother Fang.",1269561600,3,2313,4.575903614457832
3919076,2,B002EOVXA6,"The idea of cutting the story of how Barnabas Collins became a vampire into a feature-length episode was a good one. However, this DVD has been poorly edited together and omits key plot moments that are sure to leave those unfamiliar with the storyline bewildered. And, in all honesty, new viewers are the only ones who this release would appeal to. Fans of ""Dark Shadows"" will more than likely already own the episodes, and there's simply no reason to waste money on something like this. Granted, it does feature a new (albeit brief) interview with Jonathan Frid. But that alone is not worth purchasing this DVD.",1268179200,4,613,4.7924528301886795
8368067,5,B002EOVXA6,"I loved ""Dark Shadows."" Am currently watching all of them on Prime as a marathon. I was in college when it was on & of course there were no DVDs  & VCRs so it was important to watch it when it came on. There was one TV in the dorm & we were all glued to it. I scheduled my graduate seminars around it. My major professor asked why I was taking all but one of his courses & why hadn't I signed up for it. I told him that it conflicted w/""Dark Shadows."" He just shook his head in disbelief. Still aced the course and my orals & got my M.A. I think Barnabas was a great stress reliever. Watching it now, it's hokey as hell & I'm loving it. I started rewatching w/the episodes beginning w/Barnabas but remembered that it originally started w/Victoria and was more a Gothic series. I was thrilled to find that Prime had those, too, so I will rewatch the Barnabas first ones when I get to them. Am loving every minute reliving my college years. Just enjoy; it's not great theater but it's a wonderful trip down memory lane for us older people and it could easily pick up some new fans. So sorry so many of the actors have passed on; they were a great part of my life.",1516924800,,1161,4.11453744493392

Jonathan Frid spoke of how they were sometimes given a script just minutes before the cameras started rolling, so there are moments when an actor or actress seems to be obviously looking at a teleprompter or a cue card. Tough gig. I think they all did quite well. Final note: this series was ground-breaking; the first gothic daytime soap-opera ever.",1514160000,3,475,4.95

8368071,5,B002EOVXA6,"Like so many, I practically flew home from school to watch Dark Shadows on TV. In the beginning the show was live and in black and white and  focused on the mystery of the beautiful orphan Victoria Winters and why she had been hired, sight unseen, to be the governess of young David Collins at the remote seaside estate known as Collinwood. The ratings for the show didn't take off until the introduction of Barnabas Collins, who was at the beginning a rather unpleasant vampire. Oddly viewers liked Barnabas so much that the show's writers made him into a lovable vampire who wanted to change his evil nature and help people. When he was good he was very good but when he was bad he was murderous. He was very much like Batman, except he killed people and he had super powers. It looks corny now but back in the 60s we ate it up and it's still fun to watch. The 1st Dark Shadows feature film ""House Of Dark Shadows"" retells some of this tragic story and introduces most of the original cast in a more sophisticated production.",1503964800,2,1027,4.4338624338624335
