7988985,3,B000093I5H,I love this DVD HOWEVER....the subtitles on this DVD are in Chinese. I was expecting French subtitles! My students use the subtitles to make sure they understand what is being said.,1400284800,2,181,4.870967741935484
7988986,3,B000093I5H,"Although the ad says it will work in all regions, this DVD cannot be read in American DVD players.  SUCH a disappointment, since I adore the CD soundtrack and would love to see the actual play.  But you will need a Region 2 DVD player.",1389657600,,235,4.2
7988987,3,B000093I5H,Is this movie in French with English subtitles? How is one supposed to purchase a DVD if the language is not stated in the description?,1382918400,,135,4.44
7988988,4,B000093I5H,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition (new) and it was true to the description except for the ""Region 0"" part - it is supposed to play in any region, but I had to find an international DVD player to be able to show the movie to my French students!",1307491200,4,246,4.040816326530612
