1348777,3,B00004T2SI,"Basically its a cartoon.  NOT a Toy Story.  Plain cartoon animation and disappointing effects.  But the story is funny and the jokes are great at  times, especially the subtle ones that click in your head a few minutes  later.  Much of the humor flew over the heads of my 1 and 3 year olds, but  the adults in the room were smiling.  The extra features were extremely  lame on the DVD, don't even bother to play them.  My 3 yr old son will  probably make me watch it with him too many times, but he liked it and I'll  suffer through.",965779200,4,533,4.1683168316831685
1348778,5,B00004T2SI,"I have to admit, at first, I was really skeptical.  I thought this was going to be one of those really cheesy animated rip-offs.  However, I  wanted to complete my Toy Story collection and so, got a copy.  I was so  happily surprised!  This movie was incredibly funny!  It was very  entertaining, and the people of Disney did Toy Story justice.  I have not  laughed so hard at an animated cartoon in a long time!  It was really  genuinely hilarious!  The new characters are well developed.  And the LGMs  (Litte Green Men) are all in the movie, what more can you ask for?  ""OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!""",965779200,2,592,4.548076923076923

1348785,5,B00004T2SI,"In the year 2000, Disney made the pilot movie AND series of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, with help from Pixar for their openings! Sadly, only the pilot movie was ever on home video and not any of the TV show. What's more, the DVD has been vaulted lately, so it'll be tough to own a new DVD of this movie cheap, if you haven't already got it. Tim Allen played Buzz here, like in the Toy Story movies & recent shorts, but the TV series AND this movie as a 3-parter, had Patrick Warburton play Buzz. Luckily, muscular tough guys aren't all Warburton's played in toons, like the LGM's in the movie and TV show, as well as the wolf from Hoodwinked 1 & 2! Buzz Lightyear is a real Space Ranger in this movie and show, but he can't beat Zurg and his cronies alone, just watch and see how Team Lightyear came to be!

One could even say this the background story to the Buzz Lightyear action figure. With all the camp of a 60's superhero, Lightyear is the alternate universe Space Ghost. Tim Allen's voice is the spoof of William Shatner and Buzz is that clone. Be a kid, watch it with your kids and travel.... To Infinity and Beyond!",1373846400,,453,4.341176470588235

Personally, I have 2 dvd player, one is set to Region 1 - USA, the other is set to Region 3-4 // or Most players have a setting to change the region of the player.
Note that even with region set to 4 the player did play this region 2 dvd.  = played with DVD Player and also ripped to mp4 to play on the computer. No Problem!

1348854,3,B00004T2SI,"I watched this movie cold, meaning I had not read any reviews of the movie before watching it; my impression was this movie was really made for little children, not adults. This movie is not intended for adults and since we have no little children around to stimulate our appreciation for children's films we had difficulty watching it.

The tie-in with Toy Story is clearly made as the movie is introduced by the Toy Story cast of characters, but any similarities stops there. One is reminded of the TV children's shows and has much more in common with those than with the three Toy Story movies.

I can easily see that a family with children in the 3 to 8 year range may want a copy of this movie and I suspect that it may be slightly better than some other movies intended for that group. If you don't have little children at home, or at least as frequent visitors, be sure to view this movie before buying.

1348857,5,B00004T2SI,"When this DVD first came out my oldest (13) loved it.  He was never once afraid of what was going on during the cartoon.  There is a large age gap between my first child and the subsequent three.  Now my toddlers (two and three) watch it daily.

And yet here on Amazon, Buzz Lightyear has somehow morphed into a polarizing figure, on par with the likes of Barry Bonds and Ronald Reagan.

Both of my boys were fully hooked by the dazzling ""Toy Story"" movies -- and, to be fair, most of us parents were big fans as well. So what can we make of ""Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins""?

If your kids are Buzz devotees -- my sons have all but pushed for matching Star Command tattoos -- this movie is a good bit of fun. The stunning computer animation of the previous movies are missing, save for an early intro scene. Buzz's beloved three-dimensional movie pals are gone; what we have here is Buzz the cartoon hero.

Brace yourself for plenty of laser blasts, spaceship chases and, well, cartoonish showdowns between Buzz, Emperor Zurg and cast of new Buzz buddies. The movie went over well with the boys, who at 3 and 1 can somehow cope without the Woody and all of the computer animations. The question is -- can we?",1180828800,,1128,4.574257425742574

1348899,4,B00004T2SI,"Now, this movie is no Toy Story.  It's not comparable to Beauty and the Beast, Lilo and Stitch, or Mulan.  It was never a theatrical release.  But as direct-to-video sequels and spinoffs go, you aren't going to find anything else out there that's half so much fun.
This movie is supposed to be something children in the Toy Story universe watch, and is presented in the style of a Saturday morning cartoon (which it inevitably became -- one of Disney's better tv cartoons, too).  Sure, the animation is less than awe-inspiring, but it's a look that fits perfectly with the particular style of the story and characters.
The story is relatively simple.  Evil Emperor Zurg, with the help of his mysterious henchman Agent Z, invades the planet of the Little Green Men.  He steals the Unimind (a mystical orb that allows the LGMs to mind-link) and twists it to his evil purposes.  Buzz, naturally, has to stop him.  Along the way, he gets help from rookie rangers Mira (a butt-kicking alien princess), XR (which stands for Experimental Ranger or Expendable Robot, depending on who you ask), and Booster (the over-eager Star Command janitor).  Meanwhile, Buzz is trying to cope with the loss of his best friend and partner.
There is quite a lot of traditional cartoonish violence -- lasers, explosions, and enormous, impossible-looking guns.  I personally don't consider that a bad thing in this context, but it's worth noting.  The dialogue is quite clever at some points, and there are some very funny sight gags.  The climax is a bit cheesy, but the kids won't mind that -- and neither did I.
Depth is not the key here.  It's just for fun.  Anyone expecting the cutting-edge animation and beautifully original storylines of the Toy Story movies will be disappointed.  But those with a soft spot for the wacky action of Saturday morning cartoons will want to watch this movie again and again.",1036713600,3,1888,4.819875776397516

Hey, it IS a hard choice, and maybe the country is split 50/50, but I think I'm in the Buzz Lightyear half. Though like I said, it's a tough choice. Anyways, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is clear that it is merely a TV series pilot. What I mean is, most of this film is about introducing the characters you'll see on the show, setting up the situation for this upcoming situation comedy and all that. Now the show is out there, heck, it might even be off already, I'll have to check one of these Saturday mornings, but I watched it when I could, got several episodes on tape, and it was hilarious! On this DVD Tim Allen once again plays the voice of Buzz, but on the actual series the role was taken over by Patrick Warburton (The Tick, Kronk from the Emperor's New Groove, and Putty from Seinfeld). At first this bothered me, but eventually I grew to prefer his version of Buzz to Tim Allen's! Anyway, this is not important since the DVD uses Allen, so back to the DVD. As I said, it's about introducing the characters, but there IS a story involved. Here we get to see what Buzz is really all about. We get to see Evil Emperor Zurg, what it means to be a Space Ranger, and so on and so forth. It's all GREAT to a real Toy Story fan, but keep in mind that this is not Toy Story, it's not computer animation and the Toy Story gang only appear at the beginning to ""introduce"" the movie, or rather, to put it in their VCR and start watching it. The charcters here are Buzz, the huge, childlike Booster, XR the fast talking robot (who is the funniest character on the show), and the lovely Mira Nova. All the characters together do remind you a bit of the cast of Seinfeld, and some of them A LOT, especially Mira Nova. The story on this pilot episode is a bit less interesting than the show, and less funny, but it's still a must have and very entertaining. The DVD has some nice extras, including some cool games. I only hope more of this great show is released on DVD. Preferably all of it, though they rarely do that with American animation. I'd at least like to see more of these pilot episodes released, like the outstanding Duck Tales pilot, and the pilots for Tale Spin and Chip 'N' Dale's Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, Bonkers, Goof Troop, etc...All these great Disney animated TV shows need to get DVD releases.",1006819200,11,2426,4.276086956521739

A brief CGI scene with Woody(Jim Hanks, not Tom Hanks)teasing Rex over and over and then watching the movie sets the scene. Pretty smooth cel animation, nice comedy, a little action, some clever Star Wars, Star Trek, Get Smart, etc. refrences make this worth owning.

Yiu deserve to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth first.  Come read this later.  And now, for those of you who HAVE seen my other review, continue.  First, I must say--this wasn't great, this wasn't horrid either.  It is better than Pokemon junk, which I avoid.  Mira Nova was nice, and now that I have second thoughts, I like Booster, too.  He shows kids that dreams aren't wrong, but critical to a happy life.  We all have to have goals and longings, and Booster is a perfect example of that.
*Now onto the bad parts.  ""Toy Story"" fans will be utterly disappointed.  As said before, this is no computer-animated classic; heck, if it was, it'd get five stars on my scale.  The only part Pixar did anything on was the charming opening scene, in which the toys put the tape in the VCR and start watching it.  Other than that, this shouldn't even carry the name ""Pixar"".  This is more of the crud that the TV-annamation team has thrown out on the market as horrid sequels to the stuff we love.  And this is WAAAY TO VIOLENT FOR YOUNG KIDS!  Sure, this will charm you if you drool all over Saturday morning cartoons (as ""Buzz Lightyear"" has become on ABC), but this isn't wholesome family entertainment I'd expect from Disney.  This is--something.
To sum it up, this is okay--nothing more than that.  Booster and Mira Nova are the charmers, not Buzz.  But I wouldn't mind having it in my collection just for the heck of it.  I can watch it occasionally and see the good parts stand out, the values Booster and Mira (who is very independent) teach to kids.  But this is SURELY NOT a Disney classic.  Go dust off ""Toy Story"" or ""A Bug's Life"" and watch that.  Better yet, use your money on ""Toy Story 2"", which is one of the best animated features I've seen recently.  But do acknowlege this movie, which accomplished SOMETHING--whatever in this wide wide world that something may be.",973209600,6,2028,4.4659400544959125
1348935,5,B00004T2SI,"The DVD more than met both my son's (he's 7 and a half) and my expectations. For those expecting computer animation in the style of Toy Story obviously didn't pay attention to the trailers. The story is about the ""real"" Buzz Lightyear and not the toy in Toy Story. The characters are imbued with a lot of cleverness and imagination. XR is a great sidekick. I like Mira Nova's special powers. Booster is well played too. The people who are complaining about violence seem to have a distorted view of reality. Nobody dies or seriously injured in the movie. There are a lot of positive messages here too. Just to name two: good guys come in all shapes and sizes; you can do more working with others than you can by yourself - that applies to Buzz's new partners and to the LGM.
The bonus material is good too. One of the games gives you a hint of who the villains will be in the TV series. The digital comic book is a nice touch, especially with the effects added in when you opt to have the story read to you.
The song at the end by William Shatner and the Star Command Chorus was also a nice surprise.",971395200,,1100,4.267942583732057
1348936,1,B00004T2SI,"I didn't hesitate to purchase this DVD for my 3-year-old daughter.  I enjoyed the color and quality of the film for the first two minutes then was really turned off by the lack of depth this film has in detail, background, music, pacing,  character...anything one normally associates with a Disney film.  This movie reminded me of crappy Saturday morning blow-em-up cartoons, although the Saturday morning toons are better than Buzz Lightyear.",969667200,2,443,5.211267605633803
1348937,2,B00004T2SI,"Other reviewers have compared this direct-to-video offering with the likes  of Pokemon, etc.  Well, I think they hit the nail on the head!  Pokemon and  the like are, in my opinion, senseless, pointless efforts to market  products to children.  The shows themselves seem to have no real point  other than to engage in pointless violence and sell products.
I have to  say that this video is 1/2 step up from Pokemon offerings.  At least Buzz  and his cohorts are out to defeat the forces of evil.  You have to admit  that's a good cause.  Still, this show played like what I'd imagine would  happen if the old ""Spaceghost"" met up with professional wrestling  of today.  Lots of action, and lots and lots of blasting.  Some of the  characters were OK, not too memorable.  There was ONE interesting plot  development though.
The MAJOR saving grace of this video was the brief  PIXAR intro where Andy's toys struggle to get the new Buzz video into the  VCR.  Now THAT was classic -- the 2 stars in my review are primarily for  that alone.
As for another reviewer's comment about how well their child  likes this BUZZ offering...of course a child will sit through it for  multiple viewings...if someone doesn't provide any parental direction.  A  case in point is that kids will also sit through Pokemon, Digemon, and all  other kinds of brainless offerings that are out there.  Let's face it...all  those kinds of things are is digital candy for kids.  That's exactly what  marketers are hoping for...that kids will eat it up, and then persuade  their parents to buy them related products.  I don't say that in judgement  of another parent, just as an observation of what most any child will do,  given the opportunity.
My recommendation is that you put this video  toward the bottom of your ""need to watch"" list.  Not that there's  a whole lot wrong with it...it's just that there are so many better things  children could be watching.
Good luck.

1348938,4,B00004T2SI,"I bought the DVD of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins despite all the bad reviews given to it on Amazon.  And I have to say, I  was very impressed.  It's not Toy Story, OK?  Don't buy this expecting  that, cause you won't get it.  But it is a very witty, action packed movie,  with a few twists and turns that I doubt anyone would predict.  The  animation is far better quality than most Disney direct to video releases,  and some of the dialogue is great.  Zurg is one of the only humorous  villains that I have seen work on any movie.  Most usually come off just  looking goofy, but this movie really pulls it off.  And although Buzz's  character is slightly different from that of his Toy Story counterpart, he  is still very lovable.  Pretty much the only reason I gave it 4 stars was  the running time.  It's a bit short.  But all in all, it's well worth the  money, and I recommend it to everyone.  I wish I could hope for the series  to be this good, but the preview of it on the DVD makes it look like it  will be horrible.  Oh, and just to add a correction to an above review, in  the beginning Pixar animated scene, Woody, Buzz, Rex, Hamm, and Wheezy all  talk.",968284800,13,1190,4.2152466367713

My son (5) loves this movie and has been  glued to the screen for 4 sittings.  If you don't build yourself up to  expect the animation quality of the Toy Story films and accept that this  movie is on a par with Pokemon and Digimon presentations you won't be  disappointed.

Disney cannot work at Pixar`s  level. John Lasseter, the greatest story teller of our time, and author of  the two Toy Story movies, has no apparent role in the production of this  cartoon.",968198400,3,453,4.670886075949367

Don't get me wrong I love Toy Story but I think this is for the younger audiences. I was always more of a Woody fan and find his story lines much more entertaining. Now as far as the animation goes I much prefer the computer graphics but I realize that that movie quality would be much more time consuming and expensive.
In conclusion it was funny at times but really not a movie I would buy, I reccomend you rent it but only to die hard Toy Story fans like myself. If you haven't scene the movies it won't be as good.

I rented this movie  because my son loved the first two Toy Story movies. He expected Buzz  Lightyear and that is what he received. I bought this movie based on his  reaction. This movie is definitely aimed towards kids, as it is the version  that Andy would watch to become a Buzz Lightyear fan.
As I said, don't  expect to much and you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind that is direct  to video and its meant to keep the kids occupied not the adult.",966816000,,726,4.446969696969697
1348953,4,B00004T2SI,"Yes, this title is ""traditional"" animation and not the computer generated animation from the brilliant folks at Pixar.  Rather, Buzz  Lightyear of Star Command is intended as the pilot for the forthcoming  weekly animated series appearing on Disney's Saturday lineup.
The story  has everything a kid who plays ""space ranger"" could hope  for--lasers, evil robots, funny sidekicks, lasers, spaceships, and MORE  LASERS!  Parents who think the cartoon is too violent need to get a grip.  Only robots are destroyed and the diversity of the Space Ranger corps are  positives to Disney's credit.  The female characters are particularly  strong.
Make no mistake, this is not Toy Story/Toy Story 2, and it's not  presented as such.  I loved it and hope to see more this fall on Saturday  mornings!",966816000,,789,5.110236220472441
1348954,3,B00004T2SI,"Initially, I had pretty low expectations for this film and expected that it would be a quickly completed low-quality effort released only to  maintain the Toy Story cash flow. How many ways can they make money from  ""To infinity and beyond""? However, since my household includes a  three-year-old boy, any new Toy Story item is a mandatory purchase.
I am  pleasantly surprised how good the film is and how entertaining. My son is  watching it repeatedly, and I have watched it three times with him. While  the Pixar animators admittedly owe a huge debt to ""Star Wars"" (as they made  explicit in ""Toy Story 2""), Buzz Lightyear's story has the making of an  interesting series on its own terms. I am looking forward to the next  installment.
Buzz Lightyear, of course, remains an admirable super-hero  as he zealously pursues Evil Emperor Zurg. His inherent ""squareness"" and  single-minded determination to follow the Space Ranger rules are character  traits that make him interesting. What I like about the film is the way it  shows how even a super-hero can use a little help sometimes. Buzz's  partners are eccentric and a bit out of the Space Ranger mainstream; it is  nice to see the filmmakers give a nod of approval to eccentricity.
The  film works as pure entertainment for children, but it also contains good  messages about the value of friends, about persevering in the face of  obstacles, and about how good always wins in the end. There is nothing  subtle about the story or its presentation, but that is part of its  charm.
Although you will buy this film for your children, the whole  family might enjoy watching it. Even so, I sort of dread the new action  figures that we might have to buy soon.",966556800,26,1710,4.744897959183674

This buzz movie just like GI Joe and  Transformers has all the action though it is not as good and a little tamer  but it is still there, think of it as a less violet version.  This  is a great action space adveture, kids should love it and adults should  enjoy the humor. Also just so you know this is not the buzz from the movie  and it is not ment to be, this is the show that the Buzz in the movie was  basing his life on before he found out he was a toy of the cartoon Buzz  Lightyear Space Ranger.

1348958,2,B00004T2SI,"The world first met Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) in 1995 staring in ""Toy Story"" as a confused toy who thought he was a space ranger.  We were reunited with him and his cowboy friend Woody (Tom Hanks) in 1999's  smash-hit ""Toy Story 2"".  And now--in his very own  direct-to-video movie--Buzz Lightyear is far from good.
In ""Buzz  Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins"", we are caught up  with space hero after Andy's toys from ""Toy Story"" insert the  video into the VCR.  This Pixar short is very well done, and is the most  enjoyable part of the film (explaining the first star).  After it, we are  plunged into the world of Star Command and the evil Emprorer Zurg.  Sadly,  this is all too plain--no Pixar involvement here.  The movie lacks good  visual effects because of this, and it is the most bitter disappointment.  What happened to the billrant visuials that brought ADULTS flocking into  ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life""? STRIKE ONE!
The plot  here, too, is very stupid, and does not encourage thinking.  Zurg steals  the Unimind from the Little Green Men's home plannet, and tips Star  Command's balanced working system. After doing this, he uses the Unimined  (now turned from good to evil) to control every plannet in the galaxy.  This plot is not only stupid, but is recycled, and has been used countless  times before.  STRIKE TWO!
To make things even worse, if that's possible,  is the fact that Buzz's personality has been changed entirely.  What  happened to the gentel Buzz from ""Toy Story""?  Now, all he is is  some idiled superhero who fights evil with ZAP! and WHAM!  This isn't the  Buzz I knew.  STRIKE THREE!
The only good thing here is that ONE new  character has heart--Princess Nova, who (I think) echos Jessie the  Cowgirl's (from ""Toy Story 2)personality and viewpoints and walks in  her footsteps.  (I gave the film the second star because of this.)
And  the worst news is that this is going to be continued in a TV series.  (I  was tempted to say ""a continuing effort"", but there is no effort  shown here.)
In ending, this is NOT a good film, not even as a rental.  Don't waste your time.  ""Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure  Begins"" DOES NOT GO ""TO INFINIDY AND BEYOND!"" like ""Toy  Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" do. Spend your money on one of  those, a collection of Pixar short films, or ""A Bug's  Life""--please.  You'll be getting more for your money that way.

After watching the DVD a  couple of times through (and parts of it about 10 times), I am pleased with  the decision.  The initial setup with the whole Toy Story crew watching a  tape of Buzz makes the traditional animation a great concept.  After all,  we are getting a glimse of why Buzz is an action hero - it makes sense to  have the tradition animation.  Besides that, the animation itself is  excellent.  The colors are vivid and very well thought out and the  characters are charming and fit into the universe.  There is even some good  use of the soundfield, giving the surround speakers and sub on my 5.1  system a little exercise.
